5787419,5,B00DBPBOYM,I grew up watching Mid South wrestling and this brought back a lot of great memories. I liked the format they did with a mini bio and then a match. This is one of the best releases WWE has ever had and I highly recommend it.,1378771200,3,224,3.891304347826087
5787420,3,B00DBPBOYM,"I was real excited when I 1st heard that the WWE were putting together a Mid-South blu-ray. While it is a good release, it is a bit of a disappointment which could have been so much better.

The biggest problem is that there is no documentary! WTF? There is just a few occasional talking head pieces in between every couple segments. If that's what they were gonna do instead of giving us a doc, I wish they would've given more and gotten a little more in depth.

There are a lot of great matches on here like DiBiase vs Duggan and Butch Reed vs JYD but there are also some matches that feel a little like filler. I mean, how much of Mr Wrestling II do we really need? Also, there is a lack of representation for some of the wrestlers, mainly Jake Roberts.

I wish they would've given us a nice 2 hr doc on disc 1 and loaded disc 2 with just the best of the best matches.

WWE is really hit and miss with their releases. They did great jobs with the CM Punk and Mick Foley blu-rays but really s*** the bed with ones like the Best of MSG. This one falls in the middle, which is disappointing because this could have (and should have) been one of their best.",1378771200,5,1156,4.147321428571429
5787421,5,B00DBPBOYM,"I have yet to get this DVD but definitely will.
How can you not?  No matches seen on DVD before, history of one of the greatest territories in wrestling history, etc etc etc.
Just looking at the set listing (DVD or Blue Ray), leaves me in awe and excited.  I put it up there with the 1st ECW DVD, AWA DVD, and the WarGames DVD as something I need to have for my collection.  Any true wrestling fan should get this.",1378771200,,414,4.08641975308642
5787422,5,B00DBPBOYM,I am a long time wrestling fan who loves 70s and 80s wrestling. I had to go to friends homes who had cable to watch a lot of it. But I was always blown away by Mid-South Wrestling. The intensity and reality of the feuds was amazing. This is and old school wrestling fans dream set. I agree with an earlier review. This could very well be the best wrestling set ever.,1375228800,3,366,4.097222222222222
5787423,5,B00DBPBOYM,"Yes, my headline is certainly taking a big step, but there's not an ounce of hyperbole in it. First off, I'll admit-I'm biased. I grew up in Tulsa, and spent my teenage years during the 1980's addicted to wrestling...especially Mid-South Wrestling. Every Sunday night I'd be in one of the first 20 rows by the entrance ropes, amid a throng of 6,000 to 9,000. Folks, that was EVERY Sunday, and those attendance figures were for HOUSE SHOWS.
  House shows were different back then, however; the President of the company, Cowboy Bill Watts, not only had the best roster of talent in the business, he made them work. You may have had ability and charisma, but if you didn't bust your butt as much in Conway, Arkansas as you did at the New Orleans Superdome, you were gone. His rugged management style may have been hell on the boys, but for the fans, it was squared circle paradise.
  My own personal Mid-South/UWF DVD collection is pretty big, and I was disappointed to see the Watts family finally cave in and sell the video library to Vince McMahon. But I give them huge props for holding out decades longer than any other defunct organization. And thankfully, not long after acquiring this vast, magnificent history lesson, WWE is releasing what looks to be a dynamite set.
  I won't get into the history or talent lineup; if you're reading this, you probably already have an inkling. But let me tell you, from somebody who was right there, this is still, for my money, the best pro wrestling ever booked. I love Japan, and Heyman's ECW; Memphis in the early 80's was great, and Jim Crockett's territory (featuring Ric Flair and the NWA, later renamed WCW) was dynamite the entire decade. And despite growing up an NWA guy, I loved the WWF/E from the late 90's until about 2004. Just so you know I'm not strictly a bitter old guy mourning the old days!
  Hopefully this is just the first of 2 or 3 multi-disc Mid-South/UWF sets that WWE releases. But scanning the table of contents, I'm very, very thankful that they've apparently included what is still my favorite angle to this day. It was a TV taping, and Ric Flair was in to defend the NWA World title against the local top heel, Ted Dibiase. Suffice to say what occurs is one of the finest, most emotional, and downright goriest flips ever. Enjoy!",1375056000,9,2302,4.611246943765281

5787445,4,B00DBPBOYM,"This is the kind of wrestling I grew up with.  Unfortunately when I was little I did not get this territory where I lived until it became UWF, so the footage of early mid-south was a real treat. Loved the Ghetto Street fight between JYD and Hacksaw Butch Reed.  Recommend the blu ray version for the extra footage.  Match between Jim Duggan and Buzz Sawyer is a classic among the extra footage.  See footage that had to inspire later ECW.  I know everyone is going to have a match that they think should have been included, but how the Sheepherders versus The Fantastics in a barbed wire cage match from the UWF period is not on here is beyond me",1423353600,5,646,4.35

These two deserve to be included, and they are among the most important ones, but others deserve to be covered just as well. The match selection is watchable, but it feels minimal to me. There are very few promos and angles included; wrestlers other than Dibiase are represented by only one or two matches. The matches don't have much context or explanation. I feel as if the set was purposely made second-rate so that a better set can be released later on.

It probably works as an introduction to Mid-South for younger fans who didn't see it at the time, but it is weaker for nostalgia-based viewing.",1400025600,,755,4.676691729323308

Now don't get me wrong i like the wrestling we have now fast pasted and hard hitting...but there was something special about them matchs that were not as crisp as now... they seemed a slight bit chaotic and uncordinated not that the athletes were any less impressive it was just diffrent..so any way pick this up and enjoy the wrestlers of yesteryear.cole",1394582400,,586,4.485981308411215

If you never watched Mid-South this is a great introduction to the territory, but it focuses on the wrestlers who later became famous in the WWE (WWF then).  I was hoping to see stars like Eddie Gilbert, John Tatum, Rock N Roll Express, Sheep Herders, Dr. Death Steve Williams and others who to me, were Mid-South.  For those who never saw Mid-South they did great storytelling that was well thought out over a long time and mixed great wrestling with ECW style violence.  (It was very big influence in what ECW became I would argue).  Over all a nice introduction to the promotion but too WWE star heavy for my taste.",1391040000,7,740,4.575757575757576

A lot of Mid-South wrestlers were not included while some others were overused(Ted Debiase in 8 matches). Muhammad Ali is a very important figure but the mini-doc about him being in the corner for one match was time that could have been used for wrestlers that didn't make the dvd Skandor Akbar in not mentioned and is in a brief image once. Fantastics, Eddie Gilbert & John Tatum are lumberjacks for 1 match. The Guerreros, Kamala, Brad Armstrong, Shane Douglas, Hercules Hernandez, Barry Windham, Sheepherders(later the Bushwhackers in WWF) & others are missing completely.

Mid-South history.  The only thing missing was what happened to the competitors who did not become a part of WWF/E, but of course that couldn't really be expected since they're the ones putting out the DVD.",1386115200,,461,4.4
5787503,4,B00DBPBOYM,"One of the WWF's (I'll stick with the classic initials, if you don't mind) better dvd collections, featuring one of the most influential territorial wrestling promotions of the 80s.  Bill Watts' Mid-South Wrestling was a hotbed of great matches and excellent booking, creating one of the most consistently entertaining wrestling programs of the time period.  The documentary portion is interspersed between classic matches, which helps to give context to the matches.  There are a few faults here, though:  It does not include any commentary about Mid-South's run on WTBS, after the WWF buyout of Georgia Championship Wrestling (and the infamous ""Black Saturday""), it features a match or two where Jim Ross provides a more-recently recorded play-by-play, but tries to sound like contemporary commentary (despite the obvious difference between his post-Bell's Palsy voice and his time in Mid-South/UWF), and it could have added so many more great matches.  If you have ever wondered why older fans lament the death of the territories, this will answer many of your questions.",1385424000,8,1074,5.369047619047619

Highly recommended to the old rasslin fan.",1383782400,,388,4.63768115942029
5787506,4,B00DBPBOYM,"Territories dominated the wrestling scene in the 1980's from the McMahon's World (Wide) Wrestling Federation & Verne Gagne's American Wrestling Association along with the various promotions under the banner of the National Wrestling Alliance such Mid-Atlantic & Georgia Championship Wrestling & World Class Championship Wrestling amongst others but there was one promotion that's had the reputation for being one the most physically toughest territories under the vision of ""Cowboy"" Bill Watts known as ""Mid-South Wrestling"" & for years was one of the most sought after wrestling libraries by WWE with the footage itself being so rare to find past a few ""under the radar"" releases on both DVD & VHS.

Now with previous presentations of territories during this era (AWA & WCCW) not selling as well as expected, WWE decided to try a different type of presentation in having this be a match anthology instead of normal documentary with comments from various talents in between the matches such as Michael Hayes, Bob Armstrong, Jim Ross, Bill Watts, Dusty Rhodes, Jim Duggan, Magnum T.A., Jim Neidhart, Terry Taylor, Ric Flair, Jake Roberts, Steve Williams, Jim Cornette, Shawn Michaels, Road Warrior Animal, and Paul Orndorff.  Other moments showcased throughout the presentation include Tony Atlas bench pressing 500 lbs., Mr. Wrestling II coaching Magnum T.A., Junkyard Dog both painted and tar & feathered, and Jim Ross interviewing Rock 'N Roll Express while different stories were told from the talents such as the story behind the formation of the territory, different opinions on Bill Watts, memories of the long road trips, the Rock N' Roll Express vs. Midnight Express feud, what Shawn Michaels learned from working with Ted Dibiase, why Terry Taylor was mad at Ric Flair before their championship match, Jim Ross' interaction with Muhammed Ali, the formation of the UWF, what caused the downfall of the promotion, and various profiles on the the talents themselves such as Ted Dibiase, Junkyard Dog, The Rat Pack, Magnum T.A., Butch Reed, Jim Duggan, Terry Gordy, One Man Gang, and ""Dr. Death"" Steve Williams.  It should also be noted that Jim Ross redid some of the commentary on some of the matches on this set.

Matches Include:
Ted DiBiase vs. Paul Orndorff - This was fast paced from the start as each man caught the other with early pin attempts with Dibiase being able to ground him before Orndorff was able to capitalize on a mistimed mistake but it came down to weather Paul Orndorff could do what he preached for weeks in that could be break Dibiase's figure four.  This was a good match as Ernie Ladd described this match best as it being a ""Cadillac vs. Lincoln.""
""Mid-South Wrestling"" Dec. '81
[Mid South Wrestling: Giants, Midgets, Heroes & Villians]

Andre the Giant, Dusty Rhodes, Junkyard Dog vs. Wild Samoans & Ernie Ladd - This was a dream match voted on by the fans that turned out to be a very fun match that saw the babyfaces take control, heels to work the strategy of attempting to isolate & triple team one member, and eventually all six men brawling at the same time.
""Mid-South Wrestling"" Jan. '82
[Mid South Wrestling: Giants, Midgets, Heroes & Villians]

No Disqualification Match: Mid-South Tag Team Champions Junkyard Dog & Mr. Olympia vs. Ted DiBiase & Matt Borne - The loser of this match would be forced to leave the promotion for 90 days which was a double jeopardy for Dibiase as he would be also be stripped of the North American Championship due to the suspension.  This was your classic tag team wrestling formula match where the heels couldn't get any momentum until they singled out one member & heavily worked him over with double teaming & other ""monkey business.""
""Mid-South Wrestling"" Oct. '82

Coal Miner's Glove/Steel Cage/Tuxedo/Loser Leaves Town Match: Jim Duggan vs. Ted DiBiase - ""The Rat Pack"" finally comes to blows here as this was a heavy brawl that got bloody with both men throwing each other into the cage at times & ripping apart the tuxedos while fighting over who's would be able to use the glove to their advantage.
Mar. '85

Mid-South Tag Team Champions Ted DiBiase & Matt Borne vs. Andre the Giant & Tony Atlas - With Andre easily showcase his superior size & strength over The Rat Pack that they tried to single out Atlas only for him to showcase his own power causing the Pack to try to use the numbers game & dirty tactics with things being done to Andre that not many people were able to do him up to that point.
""Mid-South Wrestling"" Feb. '83

Mid-South Tag Team Champions Magnum T.A. & Mr. Wrestling II vs. Midnight Express - This match had the special stipulation of the losing team getting whipped with a strap 5 times but this match revolved around how many moments of confusion between one team completely changed not only the landscape of the match but their future as a team.
""Mid-South Wrestling"" Jan. '84

North American Heavyweight Champion Mr. Wrestling II vs. Magnum T.A. - The match was joined in progress in it's final moments with II attacking the bleeding cut of Magnum with II's new protege also making his presence felt as well.
""Mid-South Wrestling"" May '84

Ghetto Street Fight Match: Junkyard Dog vs. Butch Reed - Both men started out brawling both in & out of the ring and didn't let up as you saw Reed resort to tactics such as using a weapon in his hands & a belt along with dangerous moves such a piledriver on the floor while JYD resorted to tactics we aren't used to from him along with giving receipts for the punishment Reed gave him.  This match was exactly what advertised...a fight.
""Mid-South Wrestling"" June '84

No Disqualification Match: Mid-South Tag Team Champions Rock N' Roll Express vs. Midnight Express - Cornette put up $50,000 against the Tag Team titles with the referee taking precautions in taking away Jim Cornette's tennis racket before the match started.  This was a pretty even match up with both teams playing to their strengths while taking advantage of the No DQ stipulation including one man getting busted open & Cornette getting involved on more than one occasion.
""Mid-South Wrestling"" May '84

Mid-South Tag Team Champions Midnight Express vs. Rock N' Roll Express- Jim Cornette was put in a straight jacket & suspended high above the ring so he couldn't interfere in the match along with wearing a mask as a result of a previous humiliation thanks to RNR.  Midnight was clearly at a disadvantage without Cornette as you say they were off before they were able to resort to using their classic strategy of cutting the ring in half & working over one man in the corner of their ring and taking away their speed strength by keeping him grounded.  This was your typical RNR/Midnight match utilizing their classic tag team in ring storytelling.

Shawn Michaels vs. Ted DiBiase - This was nothing more than a quick enhancement match with Dibiase allowing Shawn to showcase himself more than he had the opportunity to before.
""Mid-South Wrestling"" Dec. '84

NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Terry Taylor - Both men kept it grounded early on with side headlocks & hammerlocks with Taylor locking on & constantly wrenching on it despite any attempts by Flair to escape resulting in him falling back on being the ""dirtiest player in the game"" to regain & keep the advantage as both men went back & forth with wresting & submission attempts resulting in an encounter that went close to 40 minutes.
June '85

Mid-South Television Champion The Snowman vs. Jake Roberts - Jake Roberts had Nord The Barbarian in his corner while Snowman had Muhammed Ali in his corner with Ali constantly having to be restrained by Ernie Ladd & his manager throughout the match as Jake kept taunting him throughout the match while also using dirty tactics to counter Snowman heavily working over his neck but things got real chaotic when Jake decided to put his hands on the wrong man.  The match itself wasn't much as this was all about the presence of & eventual encounter with Ali.
June '85

NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Ted DiBiase - This was the infamous match where Ted Dibiase was attacked & heavily busted open by his former mentor Dick Murdock followed by a very strong promo from Bill Watts assuring this match will take place which it did with Dibiase heavily bleeding through the bandage to the point where he was clearly showing the effects of the blood loss & Flair was covered in the blood as well.  This match was designed similar to the later Bret Hart/Steve Austin WrestleMania 13 match where Dibiase came into the match a hated villain but left as a bloody but loved babyface.
""Mid-South Wrestling"" Nov. '85
[Mid South Wrestling: Giants, Midgets, Heroes & Villians II]

Rob Ricksteiner vs. Nick Patrick - Ric Flair was the special commentator for this contest and was a good exhibition match for both men as they exchanged similar takedowns along with Steiner showcasing some strength & moves like what would become his signature throughout his career in a belly to belly suplex.
""Power Pro Wrestling"" Aug. '86

The Bladerunners vs. John O'Reilly & Ken Massey - This was nothing more than a quick dominate squash to showcase the team who both would become World Heavyweight Champions for WWE & WCW only a few short years later.
""Universal Wrestling Federation"" Mar. '86

UWF Champion Terry Gordy vs. Jim Duggan - Both of their respective partners were sent to the back before this match as Duggan started out in control by constantly knocking Gordy down & to the outside while Gordy attempted to slow the pace down using holds like the sleeper & trying to work over his legs before an opening allowed Duggan to do the same as both men went back & forth to the point where they both tied the other man into the ropes at one point in the match.  This was a good battle between two big men.
""Universal Wrestling Federation"" Aug. '86

Lumberjack Match: Ted DiBiase & Steve Williams vs. Fabulous Freebirds - The Freebirds were dominated from the start of this match being tossed & knocked all over the place with press slams & football tackles before things really broke down into a brawl between all four men with one member of each team eventually getting busted open and kept getting out of hand from there with not only a leather belt started to be used as a weapon but the tensions with the lumberjacks on the outside coming to a boiling point.
""Universal Wrestling Federation"" Aug. '86

UWF Champion Terry Gordy vs. Steve Williams - Williams started out in control in the early moments before Gordy was able to focus on Williams' shoulder with help from the ring post before Williams gave him a receipt & gave punches so hard that they busted Gordy open as this was a match that started to get more aggressive over time to the point where everyone in the ring felt the effects of it.
""Universal Wrestling Federation"" Sept. '86

UWF Champion One Man Gang vs. Big Bubba Rogers - Steve Williams was on commentary for this match as both men had constant stalemates from the lockup to blocking each other's bodyslams to trading fist in & out of the ring to the point where one man ended up cut on his head only for the other man to be eventually busted open as they were just so physical with their offense such as one man delivering a headbutt that hurt both men & both attempting splashes from the middle & top rope.  This was a physical match between two men that Williams describe as ""two semi-trucks or two big horses"" going head to head.
""Universal Wrestling Federation"" June '87

UWF Champion Big Bubba Rogers vs. Steve Williams - This was joined in progress after a half hour of action with Dusty Rhodes in Williams' corner showcasing him fighting back from behind to win the championship as this was more about the emotional title win & post match celebration than the match itself.

Blu-Ray matches include Rock N' Roll Express vs. Midnight Express (Apr. '84), Sting vs. Terry Taylor (June '87), JYD vs. Ted Dibiase (June '82), Ted Dibiase & Steve Williams vs. Jake Roberts & Barbarian in a Steel Cage Match (Aug. '85), Jim Duggan vs. Buzz Sawyer (Nov. '85), and Last Stampede Match between Bill Watts & Stagger Lee vs. Midnight Express (Apr. '84).  Other Blu-Ray extras include more discussions about the famous Superdome, Ted Dibiase on getting his tires slashed, Buzz Sawyer, Jim Cornette's favorite Mid-South moment, talking about elevating talent, Dusty Rhodes' travels with Boyd Pearce, and Bill Watts telling a story on Ernie Ladd's father.

It's impossible to fit close to a decade of history into this presentation but I thought they did a good job with some of the most important storylines & feuds in the company's history along with showcasing big name talent that passed through the promotion but one thing I would have loved to see is some footage & discussion of the infamous Freebirds/JYD feud where he was blinded & had so much heat that Michael Hayes admitted that ""I've never felt my life more threatened than in that era.""  In the end with this footage being so rare to find that I can't help but say I recommend but if you like the names & matches from this collection & want more then seek out the two ""Giants, Midgets, Heroes & Villains"" DVD's that include more Mid-South/UWF stars not featured on here along with the ""The Missing Matches"" VHS series.",1383004800,2,13304,4.765754019991308

The only criticism I have and the reason for the 4 star rating, I wished the documentary had been a bit more in-depth. Other than that, great DVD.

5787526,5,B00DBPBOYM,I am not sure if this is another attempt for Vince Mcmahon to try to rewrite history or what. I grew up watching Midsouth and Houston Wrestling. There are several matches on the dvd that took place at the Sam Houston Coliseum in Houston Texas but they say that the show was at the Superdome in New Orleans. And then to have Jim Ross doing commentary instead of keeping the original commentary of the legendary Paul Boesch is an insult to everyone. Paul kept that territory alive for over 50 years. He is a legend and should be treated as such. The footage is excellent and the matches are too. Just disappointed that Vince did not honor the legacy of Paul Boesch!,1380844800,4,663,4.442622950819672
5787527,5,B00DBPBOYM,"I'm so excited to finally see Mid-South Wrestling again!!  I grew up on this and I can remember being glued to the TV set every Saturday morning at 10:00 to catch the show - also going to the old Barton Coliseum in Little Rock to catch the house shows!!  Everything on this DVD set is great!!  I particularly liked Jim Ross' announcing the house-show matches that orginally had no announcers!  He announced them PERFECTLY - like those storylines were still going on today!  As far as the matches go I loved seeing the old street fight betweed JYD and Butch Reed!  Ted Dibiase/Ric Flair, Terry Taylor/Ric Flair, Steve Williams/Terry Gordy, Midnight Express/Rock n Roll Express were all great matches!  I do remember a match between Dick Murdock and Steve Williams that I wish they would've included!  But all of this footage brings me back to my childhood on Saturday mornings and also Saturday nights when Power-Pro wrestling would come on!!

This is missing a few stars though...  Bill Dundee, Ice Man King Parsons, Dirty Dutch Mantel (AKA-Zeb Colter), Brickhouse Brown, Brad Armstrong, The Dirty White Boys, The Fantastics, The Sheepherders (AKA Bushwackers), Jack Victory, Dick Slater... and what about Dark Journey and Missy Hiatt??  Those were the first 2 divas of wrestling and had a great feud!!  So I'm hoping for a 2nd volume highlighting some of them...  I also want to see the matches Kamala had with Butch Reed, Jim Duggan's feud with One Man Gang and what about Humongous and the Barbarian turning on Jake Roberts and beating him up??  And what about Terry Taylor turning heel and breaking the fans hearts?  LOL!!  Lots more territory to cover...  but this is a great starting point!  Mid-South Wrestling, NWA Mid-Atlantic (Jim Crocket Promotions) and ECW were the greatest wrestling promotions EVER!!!  I'm glad to get to see them again on DVD releases!!  =)",1380758400,3,1872,4.901273885350318
5787528,5,B00DBPBOYM,"I consider myself a new (serious) fan of wrestling and decided to pick this one up on blu-ray. I have several of WWE's documentary / match collections and they are always well made, but this one combines the documentary with the matches. While the documentary isn't as thorough as it could be, I don't mind because each segment seamlessly leads into a match that relates to it. I've never known or seen anything of Mid-South Wrestling, but DAMN this is what you imagine when you think of ""old school rasslin'"". The men were big, burly, street tough men who brawled and slammed each other in interesting matches. You believe every bump, none of it looks like athletic dancing -- it looks like gravity and flesh colliding! The first disc on it's own was 3+ hours, haven't even begun the 2nd disc. I'd love to see a second release of more Mid-South matches!",1379980800,3,854,4.625
5787529,3,B00DBPBOYM,"I must say that I am very dissapointed that though it was listed as a Blu-Ray Bonus (here on Amazon and on WWE Shop), there was no Sting vs. Terry Taylor match which is one of the key reasons I purchased this Blu-Ray. I was also dissapointed that the Steve Williams vs. Bubba Rogers match was joined in progress and not complete. I agree with other reviews in saying that The Fantastics vs. Sheepherders barbed wire matches would have been a nice addition. I'd also to have preferred seeing the title unification match between Steve Williams and Ric Flair over the Terry Taylor vs. Ric Flair match. I don't want to be completely negative as there is still plenty of good (not excellent)to this set. Once again WWE is TV-14 for this so there is a fair share of bloody matches and footage. There is also a lot of promo's and confrontations between wrestlers who have not been in the spotlight for the last 20 years, so it was good to see that.",1379376000,,941,4.445086705202312
5787530,5,B00DBPBOYM,"After years of waiting, WWE finally is giving fans a look at the Mid-South promotion in all its amazing glory. From its start in the 1950's to the glory days of the '70's and '80's, the presentation is fantastic. I was wary about no documentary but it makes up for it with great long chapters on the big things of the territory like Junkyard Dog, the Freebirds, Ted DiBiase, Hacksaw Dugan, Steve Williams and more. WWE has apparently been planning this for a while as we get interviews with Williams (who died in 2009) as well as the late Buddy Roberts and what looks like old talks with Jim Cornette among others. Together, they share an amazing view of the company with slews of great moments:

*DiBiase's heel turn

*Butch Reed painting and feathering Junkyard Dog

*The entire, brilliant angle of Ric Flair, Ted DiBiase and Dick Murdoch that still amazes you with wonderful storytelling.

*Terry Taylor's hysterical story of facing a drunk Ric Flair which is worth the price of the set alone.

*Junkyard Dog and Stagger Lee (with guys brutal on how JYD's charisma hid how bad he was in the ring)

*Magnum TA noting that ""whoever traveled for Mid-South deserved a Purple Heart.""

*The blunt talk on how the oil crisis of 1987 was the death knell of the promotion.

Sure, you can argue about stuff left out like Eddie Gilbert and the Freebirds blinding JYD. Hopefully, this means WWE will put out a second volume with more moments. However, as the title states, this is meant to focus on the big names who put the territory on the map and really made it stand out and it more than succeeds there. The matches are good, from early Rock n Roll Express vs Midnight Express to a tuxedo/cage/glove on a pole match and more. More than anything, it shows the love so many guys had for that territory and the guys in it, speaking of Williams and Terry Gordy with reverence and giving Watts his due for pushing young guys like Sting. The Blu-Ray contains more great stories and moments like Jim Cornette smashed into a cake. So once again, ignore the grumbling of what didn't get in and instead give WWE massive credit for putting together a set that brings Mid-South back to life and gives a new generation a look at what old-school wrestling greatness was.",1378944000,2,2251,4.596009975062344

Additionally, there was a lot missing.....no Eddie Gilbert and Hot Stuff Inc., no early Freebirds vs JYD, no really ""this is the start"" and ""this is the end"".....
