1206279,3,B00000FBHS,"The Bottom Line:

A meditative and often slow picture, Eye of God is a movie to admire more than enjoy: all the pieces are there, including a quietly-powerful performance by Hal Holbrook, but it's just never that captivating a film.",1233792000,,232,4.8
1206280,5,B00000FBHS,"This is a wonderful study of the face of evil and its impact upon the lives of its characters. The narrative is nonlinear and may be confusing at first if one is not warned, but once a viewer is aware of this he/she should have no difficulty understanding the film. The storyline is initially split and follows two seemingly unrelated characters, which are somehow (at first we don't know) linked through a third subplot involving a small-town sheriff and some crime which has yet to be revealed. One storyline involves a teenage boy who has experienced the worst type of loss and is now emotionally alone in the world. And there is a small-town waitress who has established a relationship with an ex-con over years in a pen-pal program. The waitress has a glass-eye which is a symbolic reference to the movie's title. This glass-eye exists in the world of the inanimate, and the scenes of human despair and sorrow are reflected in and across it without judgment, action, or recourse, as the Eye of God viewing this world exists totally separated of its theater. At the film's end we are reminded of the story of Abraham and Isaac and that the actions of any Judeo-Christian god are very seldom held up to the same standards to which he holds his people. This movie took my breath away and haunted me for days after I initially saw it. It's memory still haunts me.",1125100800,7,1364,4.617283950617284
1206281,5,B00000FBHS,"An unsung, minor masterpiece of independent cinema from director Tim Blake Nelson. One of those rare films that mananges to say EXACTLY what it means to say-no more, no less (i.e., no pretension, no padding, no hammy grandstanding). Nelson tells his tale in less than 90 minutes, but the film will haunt you for weeks. The creators of the overblown, overlong and overacted ""21 Grams"" and ""Mystic River"" could have gleaned a few lessons from studying Blake's lean yet boundlessly deep screenplay about the dichotomy of good vs evil in us all. Nelson is obviously an ""actor's director"", and inspires lead actress Martha Plimpton (of the Carridine dynasty) to deliver her most accomplished performance to date as a somewhat dense but sweet small town waitress. Ample support is provided by Kevin Anderson as Plimpton's ex-con husband who has rushed her into marriage after a sight-unseen ""pen pal"" courtship. Anderson's character has ""seen the light"" and appears to be on the road to making a solid citizen of himself (then again, appearances can be deceiving). The under-appreciated Richard Jenkins  (the father's ""ghost"" on HBO's ""Six Feet Under"") is a standout as Anderson's parole officer, as is a very young Nick Stahl (another HBO star-currently the lead character in ""Carnivale""). Veteran thespian Hal Holbrook deserves a mention, with one of his better latter-day performances as the world weary sheriff. Lucinda Williams' aching cover version of Nick Drake's ""Which Will"" opens and closes the film; an interesting choice of music as it works perfectly in both setting the tone for the story and providing a fitting coda to the emotionally devastating final shot. I can't recommend this one enough. I also second the motion with the reviewer who pointed out that the director's commentary on the DVD is atypically insightful and Zen-like (like the screenplay!).",1105574400,8,1866,5.178807947019868
1206282,4,B00000FBHS,"EYE OF GOD is a wonderfully directed and acted film. But, the real revelation for me is Tim Blake Nelson's commentary track on the DVD. Its a crash course for any film maker who wants to understand both the technique and philosophy of making a movie.
Nelson has a Zen-like clarity in describing how his film was made. Absolutely brilliant.",1068249600,6,339,4.666666666666667
1206283,5,B00000FBHS,"Though non-linear, with numerous flashbacks, this film is extremely well-structured, as it tells the story of three people: an ex-convict who has embraced fundamentalist Christianity with a zealot's devotion, a young woman from an abusive background who befriends the ex-con, a teenager who has experienced the worst kind of abandonment and separation anxiety with far worse to come, and a sheriff narrator, whose cynical attitudes toward God are based on the experiences he reveals.
The young woman has a glass eye, the result of a youthful accident.  The glass eye, of course, sees nothing, just as the woman herself cannot see the evil descending upon her until too late.  And the eye of God -- symbolically made of glass too, also sees absolutely nothing as it allows evil to flourish in God's own name.  (I doubt this movie is on Jerry Falwell's Top Ten List, and, if it were, he wouldn't be Jerry Falwell.)
The acting by all the principals and the directing are superlative.  I hope someday this slice-of-life crime drama will receive the recognition it deserves and be released in a DVD version.
This movie is difficult to categorize, but it would make an ideal double bill with the Charles Laughton-directed ""The Night of the Hunter,"" except that in the earlier movie, goodness triumphs.  Not so in ""The Eye of God.""",1000857600,17,1324,4.9192825112107625
1206284,5,B00000FBHS,"Why this film has gone almost unrecognized baffles me, and this does not bode well as a statement about the filmgoing public. Why this film is out of print is even more unsettling.  Tim Blake Nelson's elliptical editing may get in the way of some, but his deft hand with performers and pacing rivals any auteur. The story and screenplay have been sufficiently summarized before me herein. I do not recall a film tackling spiritual ambiguities in such an astonishing fashion since Michael Tolkien's 1991 THE RAPTURE.  A dark, troubling slice of Southern Gothic, with a knockout performance by Martha Plimpton, EYE OF GOD will leave you thinking for weeks, maybe months.",989798400,10,668,4.955357142857143
1206285,4,B00000FBHS,"Jack (played by Kevin Anderson) is released from prison and meets up with Ainsley, a young woman he has been writing letters to for quite some time.  Ainsley (Martha Plimpton) is a sweet romantic simpleton who doesn't even want to know about the crime that put him in prison.  Jack believes that he has been reformed by the justice system and by religion, but he's also a control freak.  For strange reasons lost in the mysteries of the human heart, these poor souls decide to start a relationship.

One can't give away too much of the plot without collapsing the nonlineary framework of the film and ruining its breathtaking effect.  So suffice it to say that this recipe for disaster is tossed up in the air along with the biblical story of God asking Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac and with all the theological and ethical problems both of these stories present.  Everything builds to whirling climax of nonlinear convergence and small-scale horror.  In the end the audience is brought face to face with that grand philosophical theme ""the problem of evil,"" and we find no easy solutions.",976147200,,1095,4.761904761904762
1206286,5,B00000FBHS,"The original play by Tim Blake Nelson is a harrowing tale of love, religion, and illusions, and the movie tells this tale with full regard and respect to the play.
The story begins with love blossoming between a  small town girl and an jail parolee who has found God during his  incarceration (Plimpton and Anderson) but also with a terrible murder  having been committed in the town.  Slowly we find that things aren't quite  right between the two lovers as she discovers she's pregnant.  Meanwhile, a  witness to the murder, a young boy, stops speaking due to the trauma of  what he's seen.  By the end of the film, all lives have intersected in one  shocking climax.
In the same style and theme as LITTLE BOY BLUE, EYE OF  GOD is small town ideals corrupted.  It leaves you asking ""WHY"",  feeling angry, almost scarred, and feeling entirely empathetic with the  people on screen.  It is true storytelling with a twist.",959385600,4,921,4.66875
1206287,5,B00000FBHS,"Eye Of God is the type of movie that will leave you thinking about all of it's many facets and twists and turns for days and maybe weeks after viewing it!  It will capture you from the first few minutes and not let you  go until the very end.  It makes you ponder about how such different  people's lives can become so inexplicably intertwined with such disasterous  results. And it hits the nail on the head with it's portrayal of a  dangerous zeolot's self-rightgeous actions in the name of God; something  that is all too common in todays news.
Along with a gripping story, the  acting and the editing make this movie a must see. I think it is one of the  best movies I have ever viewed. Please bring it back into production; I  want to buy this one for my video library.",946598400,,774,4.3125
1206288,4,B00000FBHS,"this movie touched me deeply. the acting was wonderfully real. the movie is a told through the events of two different poeple's lives. one, a young traumitized boy, and the other, a young, naive woman. At the end you see  how their two lives where connected. I really liked how this movie was put  together. the story continually goes back and forth between the two  characters. the ending is filled with many climactic scenes that will leave  a indelible image in your head. It made me cry. If you like touching  movies, you should see this movie. Hurry...buy it!",918000000,4,564,4.656565656565657
7907537,5,B00000FBHS,"5 Stars? Yes, but why? Easy answer to that; it's different, it's excellent, and in all ways from acting to directing, top to bottom. The plot is a heavy treatise on Religion, Christianity specifically, and God himself. My only complaint? The movie should have ended with Hal Holbrook's ruminations about ghosts. This is when Movies get to merge with true Art, the difference really between Movies and Film.",1521331200,,406,4.985294117647059
7907538,5,B00000FBHS,Very dark movie about an illfated romance between an excon and naive girl. Sad but has a message.,1505520000,,97,4.444444444444445
7907539,5,B00000FBHS,"The experience of seeing this movie changed my life in many important ways. Best work ever by Holbrook, Plimpton, Stahl, and crafted from the brilliant vision of Tim Blake Nelson from his original play. (Need more plays from you, Mr. Nelson!) Thank all involved for this masterpiece.",1484265600,,283,5.042553191489362
7907540,5,B00000FBHS,Very thought provoking movie. It stays with you long after the credits. All the actors did a excellent job...,1471046400,,109,4.7894736842105265

7907542,4,B00000FBHS,"I tend to agree with one of the newspaper critics who praised the film while more or less dismissing the religious element.  I suppose I feel that way because there seems to be an effort to use the story of Abraham and Isaac to illustrate the cruelty of God.  It seems to me the bible story illustrates that faith approves the believer, God has not followed the lead of earlier and contemporaneous religion in requiring human sacrifice.  Even animal sacrifice disappeared as the Christians appropriated much of Jewish scripture, saying He requires mercy, not sacrifice.  Not that it isn't fair to ask why God allows suffering, even to people as good as Job was. That said, the Margo Martindale character seems written ditzier than one might expect, which adds credibility to related dramatic incident.  I'm not sure it would have occurred to me that what transpires here would be related to the fact that the town itself is slowly dying.  Some of our serial killers have been embraced during time served via correspondence, even married while still incarcerated. If nothing else, you get an unconventional example of a believer.",1452643200,,1128,4.941798941798941
7907543,5,B00000FBHS,"This film is still freaking me out. The title and content are killing me - wondering why a film with a girl who has an eye implant, which is not even a major point in the story - is called EYE of God .... what am I missing here or am I overthinking this one? I found the movie pretty good as far as everything else, but the title .... this Review is subject to future edit!",1437004800,,373,3.857142857142857
7907544,4,B00000FBHS,"Ex-con murders his new gullible wife.  We see it coming a mile away.  I do like how it focuses on the reactions of the young witness, probation officer, and local sheriff.  This captures the charm and slow pace of a small town but also it's isolation.  People make bad choices because they feel there is nothing better to do.  The acting makes up for the somewhat flat script.",1348012800,,376,4.470588235294118
7907545,5,B00000FBHS,Traumatic to say the least. Want to be visually and emotionally desensitized watch this for the first time. this goes right up there with Sling Blade but you are shown the gruesome part near the end unlike Sling Blade. I watched this over 10yrs ago and its plot has stayed with me since.,1346889600,,287,4.433962264150943

This is a movie that you cannot walk away from while watching it or talk during it,because you may miss a small,but important point in the movie. It goes back and forth in time between the past & present. This is a good movie to watch if anybody is writing penpals and never met them,because you never know the person until you meet them in real life. To me,movies are lessons,our teachers,and sometimes movies are our inspiration.",1297382400,,578,5.892857142857143
