I went to go see this with a friend on a school night at 10:30 PM and it was so horrible that about half-way through this film about VAPOORIZE and a freakin' dead horse, we decided we'd rather go to sleep... We are teenagers and we'd rather go home on a schoolnight than stay out. I love Jack Black and Ben Stiller. But this just sucked. I mean, if you for some reason have to miss the ending of almost any movie, you always wonder ""how does it end?""... I couldn't care less what happens to Corky... I am very disappointed... The advertisements on TV and in the theatres made it look hilarious, I'm sorry I just didn't enjoy this movie at all, for God's sake... We walked out of it... Go see the Punisher.. fantastic movie!! :)",1084060800,2,792,4.251655629139073

1532362,2,B00005JM9Z,"I still wonder how Stiller and Black agreed to this script...
...this is not really a funny movie. It's about Tim (Ben Stiller), whose best friend, Nick (Jack Black), gets rich from this invention he made called ""VaPooRize"", which makes poop disappear. Alright. Now, what happens next is Tim gets jealous of Nick's big house and his fancy food and his horse, Corky, so he goes to a bar and meets a man named J Man (Christopher Walken), who can bring light to any film he's in, but even he can't really save this flick. J Man tells him to get even somehow. So Tim gets drunk and accidently shoots Corky with a bow n arrow. Now, I think they could have made this part way funnier. Instead of it being an accident, it would have been great to see an enraged Tim purposely maybe sneaking into Nick's house and breaking stuff, or stealing, or whatever. But they made it an accident. Later on, Nick asks Tim to be his partner, and Tim regrets killing Corky, so he confesses to Nick, and they're still partners.
So what's so bad about this movie? Bland, bland, bland. Nothing's funny! It's either all been done of it's not funny. Stiller, Walken and especially Black are worth more than this. Oh well. I'm sure each of them can make up for it.",1083542400,4,1236,4.425438596491228

1532364,5,B00005JM9Z,"Warning: before watching this film you must know the true definition of ""Envy"".
Envy (en've)n.-1. discontent and resentment over or desire for another's advantages, possessions or attainments.
The story goes as two best buds Tim and Nick (Ben Stiller and Jack Black)who have the same jobs but aren't both in the same pace. Tim (Ben) is in a higher focus position then Nick (Jack) who then Jack comes up with ideas for inventions. One day Nick comes up with an idea about a spray can, which if you spray it on dog-do it disappears. It just disappears, doesn't go anywhere, and just disappears. Tim thinks it's a stupid idea and doesn't invest. As 18 months go by Nick becomes a billionaire with his smart idea. But he doesn't want to leave his buddy Tim, so he builds a house near him. As days go buy and the jealousy just keeps crawling through Tims skin, one night he gets drunk and gets a cross bow and shoots it. But as Tim realizes he just killed his best friends horse ""Corkey"".
Now it is up to Tim to try to figure out what to do with this problem. It is a must see laugh out loud comedy. Ben Stiller you would see in ""Meet the Parents"" and Jack Black you would see him in ""Saving Silverman"". For the first time ever these great comedians collide in the big screen. And they bring an obnoxious triumph! These performances are great too, my favorite is Christopher Walkins performance. He is really funny in this film. This film is one of those films where you really have to pay attention too. Just really to get the comedy in it. This is a truly must see film. You laugh hard. If you loved movies like Dumb and Dumber, Meet the Parents, Saving Silverman, films like that, you will love this film. A must see.",1083369600,6,1715,4.39622641509434
1532365,3,B00005JM9Z,"This movie was an odd film mostly about dog poo and a funky invention that is supposed to make it dissapear and after 18 months it is on the shelves and sold in the stores.  Ben Stiller plays a business man who is doing well at work.  Jack Black plays this annoying man who follows Ben (forgot his name in the movie) and always has crazy and dumb ideas.
After 8 minutes of the movie, Jack comes up with the idea of this dissapearing dog doo invention called ""Vapoorize"".  He is testing and tesing and testing until it gets within 13 minutes of the movie and the invention works.
This film gave me the inpression of a comedy that was using 4th grade jokes to get around it.  Thats why there was only a few things to laugh at with all of these jokes that make you wanna laugh at the writter and not the people.
It turns out that obviously, Jack gets this huge house and he has this horse and Ben kills it from being drunk on wine that Jack gave him, making this movie very predictable.
The only few things which I thought were pretty good were that the movie gave me a little bit of laughs and if Jack Black wasn't in it I probably wouldn't have seen it.  When I saw ""School of Rock"" that movie was cleaver, funny, and exallent.
""Envy"" was neither of those it was ""Kind of cleaver"", had ""corny jokes"", and was a pretty good movie once you think about it.
I think you should see it to find out what you think.",1083369600,,1406,4.154411764705882

1532654,2,B00005JM9Z,"Slow and plodding, this is one to pass over.

Given the cast: Walken, Stiller, Black, Pohler, you expect some hilarity. This isn't really that movie. There were some comical moments - not ""funny"" but comical. It's a movie about poo! Yes, I'm over 10 and I still think that has the potential to be funny. It is also about the boom bust of inventions and market acceptance. There were a lot of ways this could go that would have beefed it up.

If you're looking for silly funny, this is not that movie. This is almost deep. But didn't go far enough to be deep nor stay light enough to be absurdly funny. It got itself stuck in no man's land. I had to pause the movie a few times to take a break from it. I endured this movie. It was an endurance event not an enjoyable experience.

The pace was on par with a lower budget film from the 80s. It's forgettable. Perhaps there was no direction from the Director. Or the Producer chopped it up? If that was the script as designed, I'd shy away from movies by that script writer. Perhaps the writer was hoping for more improv on set?

I'm sad to say, I recommend against spending any money on this. Even if it becomes a prime movie, consider how valuable your time is. If your time is worth more than $8/hr, get yourself better entertainment than this movie.",1434672000,2,1300,4.315573770491803

1532724,4,B00005JM9Z,"""Envy"" bombed at the box office in 2004, but that doesn't mean it's not worth watching (or owning). Jack Black and Ben Stiller play neighbors & best friends in Southern California who work at a sandpaper factory. Black strikes it rich with an invention and builds a vast mansion where his former home was. Of course, this stirs the envy of Stiller who gets mixed-up with an eccentric vagabond, played by Christopher Walken. Amy Poehler and Rachel Weisz play the wives.

While ""Envy"" isn't very laugh-out-loud funny, it's consistently amusing and the story is good enough to maintain your attention. Walken stands out as the offbeat bum. What I like best is the film's originality; I really can't think of any other films like it. Maybe that's why it bombed. I also like the way ""Envy"" pokes fun at materialism and everything that goes with it, e.g. envy. In addition, it's nice to watch a comedy like this without overt sleaze and overkill cussing, like 2007's ""The Heartbreak Kid"" (I don't mind realistic cussing in movies, but when it's overdone it's neither impressive nor funny; it's just stoo-pid and smacks of lazy writing).

Weisz and Poehler are as gorgeous as ever, but they're decidedly peripheral and the filmmakers never take advantage of their presence. Regardless, ""Envy"" is solid, original amusement.

The film runs 99 minutes and was shot in Santa Clarita, L.A. & Culver Studios, CA, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

1532731,5,B00005JM9Z,"I have watched this movie a couple of times and I find it way underrated. The plot may seem dumb at first, but it's very well developed and the characters are great. It's far from just a ""poop joke movie"" as some reviewers said. In fact, the poop references don't make any difference to the story line, it's a movie about envy and absurd situations.

Besides the great main cast (Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Amy Poehler and Rachel Weisz), there's a fantastic performance by Christopher Walken. His character is one of my favorite things about the movie.

That being said, it's definitely a different movie from what Ben Stiller and Jack Black are used to do. I'd say it is slightly slower paced, but still has some very funny scenes (of course, might not be your taste).

1532911,2,B00005JM9Z,"The film opens with two families going through their morning ritual. Tim Dingman (Ben Stiller) is married to Debbie (Rachel Weisz). He commutes to work with his neighbor Nick Vanderpark (Jack Black) who is married to Natalie (Amy Poehler). All this is done while listening to Leon Redbone. The film had actors and a musician who I love, yet I wasn't grabbed by the action.

Nick is a dreamer who doesn't focus. He is thinking of inventions all the time. Tim is the conservative of the two and appears to be in a more senior position at work. Nick gets an ideal of a spray that will make dog poo disappear so people don't have to pick it up. He offers Tim a chance to go 50-50 into his idea. Tim doesn't think will work.

The ideal takes off and about 15 minutes into the film, the action begins with the characters not yet established. The ""envy"" aspect builds way too fast.  Christopher Walken enters the film as ""The J-Man"" and attempts to relate Tim's microcosm dilemma to the overall workings of society, something the script does rather poorly...or poo-ly. The film moves to a low point of envy in the nude (waist up on camera) men hot tub scene.

Like the rest of the script, the expected ending comes at you rather quickly and not too well developed or funny.

The concept is funny too, in an absurd way: a man gets rich off a spray that makes dog poop disappear. His neighbor envies him, and that sets up some wacky complications. Christopher Walken as the bum who tries to help is hilarious. Jack Black plays himself, which is funny enough. Ben Stiller is the same neurotic he always plays, while the wives are both pitch perfect. This isn't for people who must have broad comedy and laughs telegraphed like sledgehammers.

I got the movie from my library to see the one and only Chris Walken, expecting to just fast forward to his cameo and let the rest go, but skimming through, it looked like he was going to be doing more than a cameo, so I sat down and watched the whole thing. I'm so glad I did. Not only is CW The Man as always and in it quite a bit with that crazy long hippie hair and energetic swagger, but Stiller and Black are fun as usual. Amy Poehler is great, too.

The bad: The movie bogs down with the plot and there are things that just don't add up, that seem forced, and that strain credulity.
The ugly: I'm not sure why Christopher Walken is even in the movie. His character serves as a distraction and an unnecessary scenery chewing waste of time. I love Walken, but his character is tacked on and brings little but filler to the movie.
Perhaps, in the end, that's where the movie falters - it isn't fully formed. It is some ideas thrown together and has a patch-work feel to it.
Envy isn't awful, it's just not great. If you can get it cheap, it's worth the five bucks or so you can buy it with. You may watch it more than once and therein you've made it worth your while.

Despite the horrible reviews when it was released, I still somewhat eagerly went to see ""Envy"".  Halfway through the movie I almost left, but forced myself to stay, hoping that it would get at least a little better.  To say the least: It didn't.  I left the theater depressed and regretfull over the 7 bucks I paid for the ticket, and the hour and a half lost seeing it.  This movie is easily one of the worst comedies I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of comedies.  Bed Stiller's performance couldn't be more disappointing, and Jack Black stupid antics weren't funny in the least.  Honestly, I think there was MAYBE one time in the entire length of the film that I chuckled, and that was forced.  Nothing in this movie was funny, just dull and boring, plus the plot is bull, and doesn't end up anywhere else from where it started.

If you're looking for something stupid but funny as hell, this is NOT it.  ""Envy"" is a total waste of time, with the only humorous thing being the time and money the producers put into this load of s**t.  Don't believe anyone who promotes this movie, though I haven't met anyone who has (Heck, most of my friends who saw this movie didn't even finish it)  Trust me, if you buy this movie, or even rent it, you will pay dearly.

1533049,4,B00005JM9Z,"Jack Black and Ben Stiller play two brainstorming businessmen fed up with their dead-end jobs and the monotonous mediocrity of it all - so Nick {Black}  becomes inspired by witnessing a man on the street picking up after his dog with plastic gloves- so he comes up with the idea of a ""Va-Poo-Rizer"" spray which disintegrates dog leavings.

So after some experimentation, realizes his dream and markets it up, with his own infomercial and quickly becomes a millionaire. His buddy ""Tim"" grows increasingly more irritated and envious, which only compounds the stress in his life, until he blows up at the boss, is promptly fired, and his wife leaves with the kids on top of it.

Depressed and nearly suicidal, he enters a local bar where he meets ""The J-Man"" {Christopher Walken}, who is basically a derelict looking for a meal ticket, and takes advantage of Tim's enebriated state. After a talk amidst intoxication, he is convinced to cause some trouble and release the stress plaguing him. Unfortunately, Nick's horse becomes an unexpected victim of the venting, and is shot dead by an arrow, to which Tim buries the animal in a hole originally intended for a pool which he could not afford.

The J-Man returns looking to collect on a reward posted to find the horse, which then begins the intrigue as the two trek out into the rain with the horse's corpse on the roof of a truck, misplacing it, and relocating his family for the night to J-man's backwoods childhood cabin.

Along the way, Nick decides to include Tim as a full partner, and they travel the world until The J-Man feels that he should get a piece of the action, who then resorts to blackmail, but is eventually thwarted in quite an ironic manner.

In the end, a surprising turn of events relating to the ingredients of the Vapoorizer, to which Nick has to start all over again with his entrepreneurship, this time with his pal Tim beside him.

Jack Black's lokian personality shines through well; and the 'moral' of the story is that instead of brooding over someone else's success, use it to inspire one's own achievements. In other words, it is productive to be pro-active, instead of merely re-active and petty; or ""greater is he who manifests his dreams than he who complains about others'"". Use this erstwhile ""sin"" to motivate one unto personal success, which in turn will enhance Pride.",1143331200,,2357,4.776412776412776
1533050,4,B00005JM9Z,"Envy is a flat-out hilarious movie. Ben Stiller and Jack Black play off of each other perfectly, and Christopher Walken is absolute comic genius - you'll be quoting his lines for days after you see this, I assure you. That is, if you *have* a sense of humor, which some people evidently don't.

The plot has already been detailed by several other reviewers - Jack Black gets rich from his Vapoorize invention, and Ben Stiller (his best friend and neighbor) drives himself crazy with envy, to the point where he loses his job, shoots Jack's prized horse Corky with a bow and arrow, and befriends The J-Man (Walken), which is a whole other kettle of fish.

The problem people seem to be having with this movie is that it doesn't fit into their perfect little definition of what a comedy should be - well, that's just too bad. Envy marches to the beat of its own quirky drummer, and if you lighten up and stop trying to analyze the movie critically, you'll enjoy it for what it is - a silly, simple comedy with likeable characters and instantly-memorizable dialogue.

Have Ben Stiller, Jack Black and Christopher Walken all appeared in ""better"" movies than this one? Sure, but that doesn't mean that this movie is bad. It's a shame that Envy has received such poor reviews, as I find it to be a feel-good movie that one can enjoy many times over, and as such it has become something of a classic in my group of friends.

The soundtrack is also excellent - completely odd songs which perfectly match the movie, including the marvelous use of the traditional ""Happy Wanderer"" song during the scene in which Stiller and Walken attempt to get rid of Corky's body.

If you're still unsure, go ahead and rent this. But I'm willing to bet that if you have a lighthearted sense of humor, you'll end up buying it anyway :) I highly recommend this movie.",1142899200,8,1841,4.566666666666666

1533052,1,B00005JM9Z,"When Robert Altman's groundbreaking M*A*S*H was released in 1970, Elliott Gould emerged as the film's breakout star. In rapid succession, Gould appeared in a flurry of truly wretched movies, and within two short years, his once-promising career was derailed. Although he has a better track record than Gould, Ben Stiller is in danger of a similar fate if he keeps appearing in disappointing efforts like ENVY.

Tim Dingman (Stiller) and Nick Vanderpark (Jack Black) are loyal friends who work together at a sandpaper factory. When Nick comes up with the idea for a chemical spray that makes dog manure disappear into thin air, he offers Tim a chance to get in on this potential goldmine. Tim refuses, and in no time at all, the invention (dubbed ""Vapoorize"") makes Nick a billionaire. And, boy, is Tim filled with envy.

Although contrived, this premise has the makings of an amusing black comedy. The problem is that the characters are presented as basically decent people: Tim is jealous, but he's more mad at himself, and still considers Nick his best friend; Nick flaunts his wealth, but he makes sure his buddy Tim is in on the good times. So the opportunity for some nasty, mean-spirited humor is squashed because no one wants to be the villain.

The film also squanders its greatest asset: Christopher Walken. Unlike some of his recent, fleeting movie appearances, Walken is afforded plenty of screen time (in fact, nearly as much as Jack Black) playing an eccentric drifter known as J-Man. Walken has the great ability to take the most mundane line of dialogue and turn it into something howling funny, but there's only so much he can do with his ill-defined role. Like Stiller and Black, he's hamstrung by a script that doesn't allow him to explore the darker side of his character. But at least he has a character; Rachel Weisz and Amy Poehler (as Mrs. Dingman and Mrs. Vanderpark, respectively) barely register in their woefully underwritten roles.

Fittingly, there's a subplot about a dead horse, which ENVY continually beats, literally as well as figuratively.",1132358400,,2074,4.9511494252873565

""Envy"" is about 2 best friends, (Stiller and Black), who live across the street from each other. I will not repeat what has already been mentioned about the plot, but Nick, (Black), meets undreamed-of success with a ""stupid dream"" that actually works.

The movie was amusing, and only in parts funny in the ""ha ha"" type. If you are looking for gut-wrenching laughter, this movie will not provide much. It is certainly amusing, and keeps one lightly entertained, but that is where it stops.

I have to admit that the show was particularly stolen by Christopher Walken, who acted well in the part of J-Man, and adds his own unique style to the movie. Walken was a refreshing addition.

I would also mention Black in the role of well-meaning, but absolutely insensitive Nick Vanderpark. The mindless optimism that the character has, as well as undying loyalty to his friends, has its amusing side. Black did fairly well.

While not the tear-filled experience of Stiller's other movies, ""Envy"" was certainly ok, and nice for an evening of entertainment.",1112140800,3,1230,4.894230769230769
1533179,2,B00005JM9Z,"There's absolutely nothing wrong with the story of this comedy to make it work on screen, nor is there anything wrong with the cast and their performances, but there should definitely have been another director for this thing.
Nick (played by Jack Black) is a day-dreaming, absent-minded regular Joe who one day comes up with the idea of a product that will eliminate the work of poop-scooping. It's called ""Va-poo-rize,"" comes in a spray-can and makes excrement disappear (sorry, certain four letter words just do not seem to do here.) Nick suggests for his neighbor Tim (played by Ben Stiller,) who naturally is skeptical towards the idea, to provide half of 4000 dollars to make the idea reality, and split the profit of the invention 50-50. Tim ridicules the idea and turns down the offer, but the product eventually becomes a hit. Soon Nick doesn't live in the house across the street - he lives in the castle across the street, and this makes Tim envious (hence the title of the film...wink, wink, nudge, nudge.)
A story this silly would work with the right director. Barry Levinston (60+ year old director of TV series such as ""Oz,"" ""The Beat,"" ""The Jury"" and of movies such as ""Toys,"" ""Rain Man"" and ""Good Morning, Vietnam"") turned a manuscript (in which the story probably appeared funnier than it does on screen) into a peculiar puppet-show. His odd and off timing, lighting, camera angles, lack of close-up shots, choice of colors, acceptance of clothing and idea of suitable music (even make-up...) is odd and unstable, as are the directional qualities of the scenes. It doesn't look like a comedy. The contrasts between certain scenes are just too heavy. There should naturally be contrast between a ""tragic"" scene of a man burying a horse until dawn (with only a shovel) and a scene where Tim has to hide ""The J-Man"" (a bum played by Christopher Walken) in the bathroom upon a surprising visit from his wife, but the burying scene looks like something dark out of a Tarkovski film, while the latter mentioned scene features music similar to the action scenes of ""Home Alone"" or some Disney film.
Something that takes our minds off this weird environment, this CLOSET that the director has locked us in, is the uplifting performance of Christopher Walken who steals the scenes he plays in; the nuances of his performance (and his timing) are highly individual and on the spot - ""GOOD for you, good FOR you...""
To sum up: this is a comedy with a good story and a good script. The actors performed their jobs well, and should be given more credit than they have gotten for these roles (Stiller and Black didn't just all of a sudden turn into lousy actors.)

The plot is simple, Nick (Jack Black) makes a fortune from his wacky invention, the vapooriser, which leaves his best friend and neighbour Tim (Ben Stiller) envy of him. Things get out of hand along the way as both men try to come to terms with the changes that follow.

The mundane plotline and monotone experience can easily be blamed on screenwriter, director and the production ensemble. And to a significant degree, it should. They failed to create an environment for the boys to fire off their funny antics.

However, to some degree this movie also highlights the limited capabilities of both Ben Stiller and Jack Black. Don't get me wrong, I find both men absolutely hilarious, but at the same token, their funneist moments were when they reverted back to their routine one-dimensional acts. Ben Stiller's quirky, goofy, awkwardness and Jack Black's childish, obnoxious, loser character.

It seemed like both men wanted to bring something different to the screen but ultimately failed to do so, always looking restrained and uncomfortable.

Overall, this was a flat and dull script which our comedian heroes failed to save.",1108771200,,1349,5.004464285714286
1533181,4,B00005JM9Z,"It goes without saying that when a movie stars both of these kings of slap-stick comedy that the story will be grossly lacking in depth, but the show will still be a complete blast and will leave your sides aching from laughter.

Here's the plot in a nutshell: Two friends, who are also neighbors, work together at the same boring, large corporate job.  Stiller is headed up and on, while Black's career is stagnant.

Then one day Black gets an idea for a product called Va-Poo-Rise that makes dog poop vanish on contact.  He asks Stiller to invest a small amount to launch the idea, but thinking his friend is finally cracked, Stiller declines.  The product takes off and makes Black billions, and the comedy begins when Stiller realizes he missed his chance to get in on the ground floor.

The comic tail is aided by both wives.  Black's wife is the rich blond bimbo who has no class, high aspirations, and no idea how to handle her new found wealth.  Stiller's wife becomes the bitter stay-at-home mom who deeply resents her husband's monumental goof and will never let him forget that they could be living the high-life.

The story is so transparent it's down right irritating, but Stiller and Black are such a treat to watch that they more then compensate.  So, if you're in the mood for a deep-thinking, plot twisting drama with Academy Award winning performances, then you may want to consider Out Of Africa or The English Patient.  But if you're in the mood to laugh and be entertained without flexing your brain, then you've found your film.

1533185,4,B00005JM9Z,I have read a lot of the reviews on this movie which claim that this movie was not funny.  I am not quite sure what Black/Stiller were after in this movie but I liked it.  There is definitely an uneasy feel for the movie as it seems to sting your emotions with some  deep sense of reality of what envy really is.  That is why I think I liked it because both characters portrayed their roles so well.  Envy is a two sided affair as the other person who has the things or life that you may want but do not have the guts to pursue.  The movie is funny in the sense of what envy does to Stiller's character.  Black's character never looks beyond the surface of anything and thus is oblivious to Stiller's envy.  I think most people can relate to the theme of the movie in their own life.  I liked it.,1104969600,,796,4.083870967741936
1533186,3,B00005JM9Z,"It might be a bit early to get in a verdict on 2004, simply because there are still about a third of the year's films left to come out on DVD, but I am just about ready to declare it a bad year for comedy.  In the last week I have watched ""White Chicks"" and ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" only to be disappointed, and have now topped it off with ""Envy,"" which is the worst of the bunch.  The only reason this one gets three stars is because it has Christophen Walken in it, and no matter how bad the script might be he is one actor who is going to make things interesting every moment he is on screen.

The selling point for this 2004 comedy is that Nick Vanderpark (Jack Black) becomes a really rich guy because he invents ""Vapoorize.""  This is one of the greatest inventions in the history of the world because you spray it on dog poo and the dog poo disappears (ergo, ""Vapoorize"").  Nick comes up with this idea one day while he and his best friend, Tim Dingman (Ben Stiller) are commuting to work at the sandpaper factory.  Nick offers to split this great idea 50-50, but Tim cannot get past the fact that there is no explanation for how Vapoorize would work.  So he passes on the deal.

Now, the whole Vapoorize idea is really just to set up the exploration of the friendship between Tim and Nick, because while Nick becomes one of the richest people on earth he continues to live across the street from his best friend.  He just happens to build his new mansion there and continues to invite Tim and his family over for food and fun.  However, Tim's wife, Debbie (Rachel Weisz) cannot get past the fact her husband has thrown away their one chance at being rich.  This explains where the film's title comes into play as the green-eyed beast consumes Tim's soul.  Meanwhile, Tim's wife, Natalie (Amy Poehler) is running for the state senate, but her campaign is being derailed by her opponent's big question: where does the poo go?

Our expectation is that there will be a big payoff to this question, but there is really not much effort to do anything with the Vapoorize idea.  What really matters is that it is a farfetched idea and that if it did work it would obviously make its inventor really rich.  But then you would also expect Jack Black to be a lot funnier than he is in this film, because otherwise why would you hire him to play the part?  Stiller's character is in more familiar territory as he learns why you do not shoot an arrow into the air without any idea of where it is going to land.  Fortunately the gets to do a lot of scenes with Walken's character, the J-Man, but that is not enough to salvage this film.

I actually read that ""Envy"" was intended to be a black comedy, in which case it is even worse than I thought.  There are some nice parodies of television infomercials, but none of the sharp wit I associate with a classic black comedy (e.g., ""Hospital"").  In addition to Walken's performance the only thing I find redeemable about ""Envy"" is where it ends, which I thought was a nice touch given where it starts.  It is just how you get from that first point to that last point that does not work and unfortunately that is most of the movie.",1104883200,,3185,4.355329949238579

They wanted to quote his quirky lines from the movie at the water cooler the next day, but their weren't any to speak of. It was a unique comedy with great characters. I have nothing against this movie or its ""out there"" plot.

You know...I figured this movie was going to be aweful. I mean the reviewers are dragging this movie through the mud like it's the sin of sins. Well, I've concluded the negative reviews are not at all justified.

What ENVY is, is a very tame movie. There's very little cursing, there's NO half naked women, there's NO gang violence, there's NOT any crude humor...and so forth and so on... In fact, there's no deliberate mischievous behavior of any sort. What there is, is a story about 2 best friends, their wives(whom they're both faithful to), and their children. I was shocked while watching this movie because I don't remember one commercial about two families that are close or anything like that(not saying there weren't any, I just don't remember getting that impression about this movie). Perhaps it was bad marketing, perhaps I just wasn't paying attention, perhaps it's a little of both? Nontheless, I feel this could have easily been a great family movie if they'd just taken out a couple of the bad words and focused on the family and children a little more. By the way, the cursing is very tame compared to todays standard. I still wouldn't let my little kids watch it though.

There's a great underliying story here in ENVY and I think it's a shame that no one is seeing that. If you like uplifting comedies, give it a try. Heck, I don't think you'll have to pay much for it since it's getting quartered like a theif in the dark ages. Unjustly, I might add.",1103155200,,1479,4.61596958174905

Ben Stiller and Jack Black make a great duo, although the aspect of Envy that did not work was that the story line was a little weak in it's development.  They could have done more with Ben Stiller's character when he sees his best friend (Jack Black) get rich overnight with a spray that vaporizes dog poop. He is envious, but the movie itself seems lack a clear direction at times. Certainly there are funny aspects to the movie, but, as often is the case with Ben Stiller movies, it is a subtle kind of humor. For instance, at one point he abruptly blows up at his boss after the pressure to live up to his neighbor gets to be too much for him. Overall, this wasn't bad, but they could have done so much more for this.",1102636800,,868,4.2926829268292686

""Envy"" is a cute comedy, and it starts off with lots of promise in its premise: Idiot Jack Black invents a Poo-B-Gone spray that makes his smarter neighbor and pal Ben Stiller (you guessed it) envious. There are some interesting sight gags, like Stiller killing Jack's horse with a bow and arrow; Stiller and half-cocked Christopher Walken (who really makes the most of his role -- hey, Christopher Walken would turn Baby Bop in a ""Barney"" video into a unique role) driving around with the horse on top of Stiller's mini van; Black and his wife (played by Amy Poehler) turning their suburban ranch house into a gaudy mansion, etc.

Unfortunately, this movie runs out of propellant, what with the one-note-Johnny plot. For a black (not Jack, but dark) comedy, it has an unlikely ""aw shucks"" touchy-feely ending.

I can instantly think of cast and crew having done way better things in the past, every one of them. True, any movie with Rachel Weisz is quite easy on the eyes, but she doesn't have enough screen time to justify this as ""eye candy."" Plus, she was much more believable in ""Enemy At the Gates."" Amy Poehler way funnier in ""Upright Citizens Brigade,"" Jack Black put to better use in ""School of Rock,"" Stiller too low key in this one, even his character in ""Something About Mary"" was much more animated. Composer Mark Mothersbaugh must be in a musical devolution (forgive the pun); His soundtrack to ""Rushmore"" much more quirky, charming and inventive.

However, ""Envy"" makes a good rental. I give ""Envy"" 2-1/2 stars, but since that rating doesn't exist here, I'll be charitable and give it three.",1102550400,,1785,4.766990291262136

Given the competent-to-good talent involved with the film -  Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Christopher Walken and Barry Levinson - it appears that the lack of quality is no accident.  If there was any attempt for quality, you'd expect at least a couple good moments, but - outside of a mildly amusing scene involving a malfunctioning merry-go-round, there is nothing funny in this whole movie.  There are things you may recognize by structure and delivery as jokes, but they will not make you laugh.

The story involves Black and Stiller as neighbors and coworkers.  Black is constantly dreaming of weird inventions, and when one of them becomes wildly successful, Black is catapulted into great wealth.  Stiller - who had an opportunity to invest in the product and didn't - is left in his middle class existence and filled with envy.  His inability to cope with his feelings (and the lack of support from his greedy wife) leads him to snap and get in greater and greater problems.

In capable hands, this could be a good movie; since the people involved were capable and the movie is horrible, you have to believe that it was deliberately made bad.  Maybe this supposed to be some sort of artistic statement about the nature of good and bad movies:  if a person could aspire to make a great movie, can't he also aspire to make an awful one?  I can only guess as to what made Levinson and company create this film, but since they were obviously aiming for one-star quality, that is exactly what I am giving them.

Christopher Walken steals the whole show with his hilarious portrayal of a 1960's hippie deadbeat who befriends Stiller in a bar which looks exactly like Moe's Tavern in the Simpsons.  Stiller and Walken take up around three minutes of movie time trying to dispose of a dead horse accidentally struck by an arrow fired off into the night air by Stiller.

Two co-workers drive to work everyday in their daily stupor each suggesting stupid ideas on how to get rich. Jack Black is toned down in his role as the man who invents a way to eliminate doggy waste and his sad side kick, played by Ben Stiller, sort of wallows in his waste. The two friends develop different personalities as they experience success and the inevitable jealousy of the left behind. Black and Stiller are great together darkly conveying the excesses of human nature to a tee. Their wives (Amy Poehler and Rachel Weisz) are just as crazy and succumb to the pull of a padded paycheck. As Black increases his wealth and fame Stiller and his family sulk in despair and desire what exists on the other side. Offering further comic relief is Christopher Walken as a conniving homeless man who befriends Stiller at one of his lowest moments.

While this film isn't a laugh out loud fest it is entertaining in a subtle way. Anyone who passes a mansion and wishes for what it contains can relate to the understated stabs at the principles of the wealthy and the wake they leave in their pompous paths. Both Black and Stiller are perfect at pretending to be serious while simmering with dark laughter.

The whole premise of this movie was wanting you to envision the character of Jack Black as being intelligent enough to even make it believeable that he could come up with the concept of Vapoorize in the first place. That is where this movie in my opinion, fell apart. Anyone but Jack Black would have been more believable, and funny at the same time. I even thought Owen Wilson would have been much better! Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson make a great team in any comedy! Just remember the classic Meet The Parents, Zoolander, Starky and Hutch, and you can get the picture.

1533332,1,B00005JM9Z,"Ben Stiller and Jack Black. Sounds like a comedic duo that would have us laughing so hard that we might just pop something. At least this is what I thought. Sadly though, this movie just did not make me laugh as much as I thought I would. I probably laughed maybe twice through the whole movie. Nothing was really that funny. So I was hoping the story would at LEAST be a little interesting. Once again...nope. You could predict just about the whole movie.

A short summary of the movie. Black and Stiller are best friends who work together. Black is a dreamer and Stiller is down to earth. Black has an idea that could make poop disappear. Stiller tells him to stop dreaming so much. Black actually invents the VaPOOrise with a little help and becomes extremely rich. Stiller gets envious. Black is still best friends with Stiller and buys him lots of stuff. Stiller is... envious. Stiller looses his job. Stiller then does something bad and tries to cover it up. I guess funny antics were supposed to happen after this. The end.

If that summary sounded boring, well, it's not my fault. I didn't write the movie.

Even Christopher Walken couldn't do anything for this movie. I'm a huge fan of Walken even though he usually has the same two characters in every movie. Either crazy, wierd, funny guy or crazy, intimidating, bad guy. He was actually annoying to me in this movie.

1533335,1,B00005JM9Z,"Clich after clich after clich is all I have to say about this film.  Creativity was at an all-time low when they decided to make this film.  I am surprised that Levinson attached his name to this picture.  The story is weak, the characters are dull, and there is not one moment of genius to be found in this film.  I was ready for a dark comedy.  I knew that this was panned by every critic, so I thought it might be one of those rare finds that Hollywood critics hated, but those interested in film would love.  Boy, was I wrong.

Where did this picture go wrong?  I would like to start at the beginning (like any good story) and just point out that if you have a character that it unfocused, you do not need to point it out for the viewers.  I understood that when Black's character continually mentioned new ideas instead of focusing on the task at hand.  I don't need a graph to point out the character flaw.  Second, what was the point of Stiller's character?  Was he a family man or was he just trying to compete with Black the whole time?  This made me think if this ""friendship"" really did exist.  Did Levinson really pull the wool over our eyes by making us think that Stiller was good friends with Black?  It is obvious throughout the picture that Black respects Stiller's friendship, but does it work both ways?  Hum, something to ponder.

As the film continues, I hope that perhaps we would have secondary characters that help pick up the slack for these main characters, but, sadly, this did not happen.  Amy Poehler and Rachel Weisz couldn't have kept this film afloat if they tried.  Their moments of glory never happened, which allowed for only one good thing to come of this film (and it really isn't that great), Christopher Walken.  He is slowly moving into comedy and he is very good at it, but he should not be used to save the film.  I saw that as his sole purpose in this movie, to save the hideous jobs done by Black and Stiller.  While I will argue that scripted Stiller is better than ad-lib Stiller, he just couldn't hold himself in this film.

Was it Levinson's direction or was it the story?  This is something to consider when watching this film.  My feeling was that it was the story.  There was just no heart in it.  While I did hear rumor that Larry David helped create some of the awkward moments, there was nothing powerful in this story.  This is one of the first times that I can honestly fault the story for the negative reaction to this film.  It tried for intelligent humor based around a ""bathroom"" topic.  Poehler's secondary story was absurd.  Here we have someone fighting for the environment by having rallies at waste centers and living right underneath enormous power lines.  I kept waiting for this film to be a bad dream or perhaps a reaction from the radioactive electricity that was floating above them, but it never happened.

Finally, I would like to say that if you are making a movie where a mansion is needed, how about actually using a mansion instead of CGI-ing the house.  That was an immediate turn-off for me and just a quick example of the spotty production on this film.  What was Levinson thinking?  Envy was not like him, and it honestly left me with a bad taste in my mouth for anything Levinson may release next.  Where was Wag the Dog?  Where was Bandits?  It was as if he just threw out anything learned from these films and went back to filmmaking 101 for this movie.  Perhaps he had one of his children direct it and he just put his name on it ... the world may never know.

Overall, the stiff performances by two good actors (Stiller and Black) immediately catapulted this film into the ""bad"" hemisphere.  There was nothing redeeming about the story, direction, or other actors that could help bring this film back down.  This was a bad movie.  From the beginning throughout the unfunny ending credits, Envy just didn't work.  I do not recommend this film to anyone unless you are looking for a good night's sleep.  It will definitely make your eyes feel heavy to watch.

At least Dorm Daze had the excuse of having a cast of nobodys and obvious hack writers and directors.  But this movie has Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Barry Levinson!  I watched this movie for 45 minutes then turned it off.  I can't remember the last time I did that.",1096588800,2,358,4.144927536231884
1533373,3,B00005JM9Z,"Jack Black isn't funny.  I don't know why people insist that he is. He has a funny face. Maybe that's what it is. People confuse his face for comedical talents. It's possible. His horrible acting and ability to deliver a joke is what keeps this film down.
I found that all the laughs in this film (as few as there was) came from Ben Stiller (who I also never found funny) and  Christopher Walken. I have to admit seeing Ben Stiller ramming a dead horse with a go-kart was pretty funny. As sick as it is I find it funny. I'm a sick person.",1096588800,,538,4.163461538461538
1533374,2,B00005JM9Z,"I read the bad reviews before going to see this movie. I refused to belive it when they said that there were no laughs to be found within the first half hour. They were right. The theatre I saw it in was stone cold silent for that time-seriously!! No one was laughing, not even me.
This goes to show how vastly underused the cast of this movie was, especially with solid actors like Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Christopher Walken, Rachel Weisz and SNL's Amy Poehler, who are all usually hilarious! That being said, Envy is a cute comedy that has some minor laughs and even a few good laughs. Unfortunately, the good laughs are a little too few and far between to make this a great movie. It is still watchable, though.
Also, in several scenes, the boom mikes are very plainly in view. I dont' just mean the tops either, I mean the entire mikes! Maybe the studio just didnt' care. We'll see if the DVD rectifies this.
Watch this movie if you must, but keep your expectations way low.",1091232000,9,979,4.414364640883978
1533375,3,B00005JM9Z,"I know so many people who did not like Envy. In fact, test audiences hated it so much, the film would have gone straight to video had it not been for the success of the totally overhyped School of Rock. But I enjoyed Envy. Granted, it wasn't Oscar material, but hey, I don't think Lord of the Rings was either. Moulin Rouge yes. Chicago definitely. But Envy is what it is, a cute, funny, enjoyable comedy with a great cast and a unique story. Perhaps that's why audiences were turned off. When's the last time anything unique was enjoyed by audiences? I think Envy is judged way too harshly and should be given a chance, especially for fans of Ben Stiller or Jack Black. This isn't their best movie, but it's a very fun one. Grade: B-",1090022400,2,734,4.364963503649635

1533377,4,B00005JM9Z,"Wow! I can't believe I'm going to be the first person to suggest that someone should've used VaPOOrise on this movie!!!
There, that's made me very happy.
Actually i don't really believe my own terrible joke.  I found Envy to be a captivating movie.  If you're expecting a laugh-out-loud movie like ""Zoolander"" you'll be disappointed - if you prefer more subtle, dark comedy fodder such as ""Very Bad Things"" you'll be happier.
After Black invents the aforementioned ""VaPOOrise"" and becomes incredibly rich and famous, Stiller commits his second act of Equicide in as many films.  Much twisted hilarity ensues, but everyone lives happily ever after. Except the horse of course...
For me the best part of the movie was seeing Christopher Walken reprise his role from ""America's Sweethearts"".  The man is an incredible actor, and he possesses both comic timing and acting ability that Black would give his greasy, unwashed fringe for.  Stiller plays Stiller as usual, Black is admittedly under-used and the plot sags in the middle, but overall it's a good movie and Walken makes it a worthy rental, if not quite theatre material.",1085702400,,1125,5.026881720430108
1533378,3,B00005JM9Z,"In the end, I was expecting to see a much better outcome from a movie that stars Jack Black and Ben Stiller. Jack Black made me laugh out loud in such films as "" Orange County"" and The School of Rock"" and Ben Stiller was just genius with ""Zoolander. Now, you would think that ""Envy"", having two great comedy actors, would combine the laughs of ""Zoolander"" and ""The School of Rock"", but instead we got problem after problem, and only a couple of good things. ""Envy"" was postponed from last summer, and I think there was a release date set for before that, and I could understand why. It is not intolerable, but it is not really very funny. It is a dark comedy, which is something that I normally love, but this time I didn't find the darkness amusing. The film did not have anough effort put into it.
The movie has Ben Stiller as Tim Dingman and Jack Black as Nick Vanderpark. The two have been friends since they were kids. Tim is a hard-worker, but Nick is always spacing out, and thinking about things. He gets a great idea in the form of a spray can that when you spray on poo, it disappers. He comes up with the name ""VaPOOrize."" Nick wants Tim to invest $2,000 in the idea, but Tim refuses, a mistake that he will soon regret. Eightteen months later, Nick and his wife Natalie are richer then everybody in town. They built a mansion across the street from Tim and his wife Debbie, and everyday Tim and Debbie have to see the big house across the street. The house that they could have had if Tim just invested money into the idea. Nick is so rich, that he has a carousal, a horse stable, and a bowling alley next to Nick's bedroom. Tim becomes green with envy, causing Debbie to leave for a while. Tim yells at his boss, gets fired, and goes to get drunk. There he meets a drifter named J-Man. The two become friends, but J-Man has to help Tim after Tim does something that could ruin the little bit of everything that he has.
The biggest problem with ""Envy"" is that some of the jokes that should be funny don't work. The second problem is that you cannot sense the kind of envy that Tim is feeling, because we don't see enough of his changing. You can't relate to him, and you don't understand why he could be so mad. Jack Black was alright, but it was Amy Poehlar, who played Nick's wife, that was just awful. She wasn't funny at all.
I enjoyed ""Envy"", but it wasn't something that I could see over and over again. It wasn't even worth a trip to the theatre. I am just hoping that Ben Stiller's next movie ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" is better then this. ""Envy' has a funny idea, but it just doesn't work.
