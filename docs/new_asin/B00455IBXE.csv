8416505,3,B00455IBXE,"This is, quite possibly, the best documentary I've ever seen.  The movie gets five stars. On the other hand, the misrepresentation on the part of the seller gets one star.  I bought this video thinking I was purchasing something new. When I received the video, I was deeply disappointed to discover that the documentary I purchased, titled ""Tribute to the President John F. Kennedy, Looking Back Over a Thousand Days in Office,"" was actually ""John F. Kennedy: Years of Lightning, Day of Drums,"" which I already own.  If I had known this was the case, I wouldn't have purchased this video.  Not only was the title misleading, but the quality of the dub was sub par.  The picture was excessively dark and grainy, and the sound quality was muddy. I would have returned it, but doing so would have been a hassle.
Again, the documentary, originally released in 1964 under the title ""Years of Lightning, Day of Drums"" is a brilliantly produced and profoundly moving tribute to JFK and comes with my highest recommendation. If you're interested, look for the original title, not this newly-released disc advertised as ""Tribute to the President John F. Kennedy.""",1328400000,3,1154,4.897435897435898
