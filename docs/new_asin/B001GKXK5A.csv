3613797,5,B001GKXK5A,For anyone trying to lear the CSS on their own this is the perfect DVD to slow everything down and work on the basics. Then slowly bring everything together to become as efficient in the water as possible.,1320019200,,205,4.421052631578948
3613798,5,B001GKXK5A,It was very helpful I learned a lot from this video.. After only a week I'm now able to do the combat side stroke.,1319414400,,114,3.7916666666666665
3613799,5,B001GKXK5A,This CD provided ALL the details you will need to become proficient at the CSS. I purchased it for my son who is going into Navy Dive School. It will help immensely for anyone needing to pass the PST for entrance into the special forces.,1311120000,,237,4.288888888888889
3613800,5,B001GKXK5A,I'm joining the Navy to become a SEAL and I got this video to get my css down pat before boot camp.  This video really helped me with my technique; I didn't realize how some little things can make a big difference while swimming.  The video is easy to understand and has been a great resource for me.,1255910400,,300,4.155172413793103
3613801,5,B001GKXK5A,"If you plan on becoming a Navy SEAL, EOD, Air Force CCT, PJ or Army Special Forces this video is vital to learning propper technique for one of the most utilized strokes.

I used this video with great sucess and its much cheaper than a swim coach and most swim coaches don't know or use this stroke.",1253577600,3,299,4.245614035087719
8305776,5,B001GKXK5A,"Great instructional DVD! I learned how to do the combat side stroke, and I passed the swim test in my uniform for the German Armed Forces Proficiency Badge! Well worth every penny.",1450742400,,180,4.65625
8305777,4,B001GKXK5A,"This is a useful demonstration video, but it won't be easy coaching yourself. If you want faster results better have an instructor or someone who can watch you and critique your form.

one very minor detail is that the video loves replaying the same song during the entire lesson, it makes me laugh cause the voice seems to be always singing the word ""Liberty"" and ""Land of the Free"", i think the video editor had an extra cup of patriotism when working on this",1436572800,,461,4.488095238095238
8305778,5,B001GKXK5A,simple and to the point. I learned my combat SS quickly,1419379200,,55,4.090909090909091
8305779,5,B001GKXK5A,"Man am I glad I got this. I've been doing the CSS for a awhile on my own from viewing youtube videos and my stroke can use a little fine tuning. I decided to learn from the begginnig even though I know how to do it and it was a big help. I find I'm more balanced and move more fluidly. Not a complaint but to anyone thinking of purchasing, the method taught in the DVD is not the corkscrew method, you stay on your side basically the entire stroke.",1413072000,,448,3.988888888888889
8305780,5,B001GKXK5A,"Excellent instruction, taught me how to do the sidestroke properly",1406937600,,66,5.7
8305781,3,B001GKXK5A,"I got this DVD to learn how to do the CSS the right way just to swim better. The instructions are good and the video footage is good but where is Don Walsh? You don't even get to see much of his face, let alone have a few words from him. No intro, no good bye, nothing. Just narration from another guy and a corny song in the background which causes distraction and makes you go nuts. The DVD is divided into seven steps which last 2-4 minutes each and there is a bonus section which helps with the basics. Could've been an excellent DVD had it been done a little different and that's why I am giving it only three stars.",1372982400,,621,4.098360655737705
8305782,4,B001GKXK5A,This is an excellent DVD.  He breaks the CSS down very well.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the cheesy music in the background.,1367452800,,139,4.111111111111111
8305783,5,B001GKXK5A,"I'm not a skilled swimmer, but I haven't had much luck finding a competent swim instructor whose schedule matched mine. I've been trying to improve my swimming skills on my own by watching a lot of YouTube swimming videos.  Some have been very good and helpful.  I didn't think a DVD on the side stroke would add anything new, but I was really curious about this DVD because of the positive reviews so I decided to ""roll-the-dice"" and order it.

I must admit that I've been pleasantly surprised at how good this DVD is at explaining and demonstrating how to do a proper combat side stroke (CSS).  I've been slowly going through the skill progression on learning the CSS.  I go to the pool at least twice a week to practice what I've learned on the DVD.  Sometimes I fail and I have to go back to watch the DVD.  Oftentimes, my failures are highlighted on the DVD since most are common mistakes.  It is frustrating at times because I recognize what I'm doing wrong, but I just can't seem to do it right.  Nevertheless, I continue on since only practice and more practice will correct my mistakes.  One of these days, I'm going to be able to connect all the necessary skill sets to do a proper combat side stroke.

If you can't find a competent swim instructor, and you've got the motivation to learn on your own, I highly recommend this DVD.

p.s.  After watching YouTube videos on CSS, I noticed that there are several different types of CSS.  The CSS on this DVD is more similar to the standard side stroke in that staying on the side throughout the swim is emphasized.  Other styles of CSS have the swimmer's body going flat with the face pointed down underwater in the glide.",1335830400,6,1678,4.473684210526316
8305784,5,B001GKXK5A,"Some of the other reviews seemed kind of similar and too glowing, so I thought they might have been planted by the publisher.  There's not much else out there for combat side stroke, so I decided to get the DVD anyway.

It is awesome.  I hadn't realized how screwed up my own feeble attempt at combat side stroke had been.  Just by methodically going through the exercises on the DVD I managed to easily get my 500 yard combat side stroke to 12:00.  I'm 33 and only in so-so physical condition.

You will not be disappointed in purchasing this DVD!",1330732800,3,548,4.43
8305785,3,B001GKXK5A,"This is a good tool for those who aren't in contact with their local dive motivator (because the motivator will give you better advice on your technique than a video can) and need to understand the fundamentals of the combat sidestroke. I am currently in contention for a SEAL challenge contract and I used this DVD to help with my sidestroke. I used the fundamentals displayed in the DVD to get the basics down first. Then, built on those basics by finding out on my own and with the help of my motivator what little adjustments I could make to get my times down and complete my 500 yd. with a little more ease to allow more energy saved for the fallowing push-ups and pull-ups. My swim now is a solid 8:10-8:20, that's not the fastest, but that is a competitive time combined with high scores on the rest of a PST. I gave the DVD 3 stars, because as good as it is; the music is corny, making it a distraction. I recommend getting in touch with your local recruiter and finding out what can be done to get in touch with a group training for the SEAL PST or a dive motivator. A video is a start, but getting in with the real deal and actually having the guts to start something new and make an effort outside of buying a product, is truly the biggest and most important stride.",1327017600,3,1277,4.2809917355371905
