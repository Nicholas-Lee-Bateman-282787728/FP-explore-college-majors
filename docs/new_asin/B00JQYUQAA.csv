6389126,1,B00JQYUQAA,"This story sounds like a pretty cool one that should have been easy to tell with relative ease. Drug crime encroaching on nature sparks the rise of a supernatural like creature to fight back. ( Much like Godzilla). The only real problem with the story was the writing. Specifically the dialog. Most of which seemed unrealistic to the situation or characters. There was a lot of conjecture within conversational dialog between the characters, meant to justify the situations and relevance but mostly it just came off as out of place and full of holes. There really isn't much in this story that  was believable or convincing. Also too many of the actors appear to be too amateurish or really disconnected from the story, acting is much more than hyperbolic.

The effects and soundtrack for Black Water Creek: Legend Of Sasquatch is pretty amateurish as well. Some of the effects work, mostly because the shadowing or quick glance at the blood or practical effects used didn't allow for the audience to notice just how cheap the tricks where in the scenes. Other times the gore or death scene were just to fake and poorly managed that it comes off offensive to the horror fan. This film could have been so much more, and the man-in-the-suit creature could have worked had the team behind this film really put more professionalism into the other aspects of the film. There is just too much that doesnt work in the film for it to really be anything other than a waste of 2,000 dollars. Viewer beware!",1432080000,3,1496,4.727969348659004
6389127,1,B00JQYUQAA,This movie is horrible.  The directing is equivalent to what I could do in high school and the acting doesn't help.  I wish I still had my five bucks.,1431129600,2,150,4.137931034482759

6389130,4,B00JQYUQAA,Not bad for a low budget flick. It would have been much better if there were a robot in the movie.,1420243200,,98,3.7142857142857144
6389131,2,B00JQYUQAA,Did not like it.,1413072000,,16,3.25
6389132,1,B00JQYUQAA,"This is the worst movie I've ever seen, of any genre. Random editing, confusing flashbacks, a cheap gorilla suit sasquatch. Making terrorists watch this at Gitmo would violate the Geneva Convention.",1408752000,3,198,5.419354838709677

8653413,1,B00JQYUQAA,"People stay away from this movie. It is not about big-foot at all. It's a joke. A lo budjet movie. Someone in the woods a screaming,that's it. I watched about 15 minutes of it. And took it out. Boring as heck. Very ridiculous..Not worth the moneyIt shouldn't be sold as a  big-foot movie to begin with. Keep your money this movie is a joke..",1500336000,,341,4.328125
8653414,3,B00JQYUQAA,"Ive seen worse. - much worse, but this is solidly a bad movie.  Some actors didn't get their dialog; therefore, their delivery was awkward. (I thought that is when the director yelled Cut!, then told them how to deliver their lines.  the director must have given up, or else he was too overwhelmed.) The script is extremely ambitious for a fledgling group of movie makers on less than a shoestring budget.  A squatch suit should be a bit more than a Walmart gorilla suit with a melted face mask. The sound was so bad I eventually turned on subtitles. I was only reading them when needed, but I swear, there is at least one place where the subtitles showed ???? instead of the dialog.
I wanted it to be better. I liked the attempted story line. (I think) it was a bit hard to follow part of the time. I had the plot twist figured out early in the movie, but I wasn't certain they would actually go that direction.  It is a difficult situation to film believably, and they do not do it justice. But props for trying.  It is really easy to criticize, but I probably couldn't do any better.  The difference is, I don't try.
If you have ever watched community theater (in a small community) then you can get through this. Just don't expect a lot and don't pay much to see it.  I watched it on Prime video.  (Included with subscription)",1495324800,,1330,4.378048780487805
8653415,1,B00JQYUQAA,"Near bottom of the barrel acting in a movie that's more about 2 inept police officers going after bad guys. Bigfoot is there, in unconvincing fashion, and only adds to the confusion of why this movie was made. Put all bigfoot movies on a linear scale and this will be on the bad end. You'll keep your fast forward button warm with this.

8653416,1,B00JQYUQAA,I would give it 0 stars! POOR POOR MOVIE!! The acting was just beyond awful. Nothing made sense. It was just a person running around in a wore out gorilla suit making moaning noises.,1475020800,,182,4.382352941176471
8653417,2,B00JQYUQAA,not to good,1448150400,,11,3.0
8653418,1,B00JQYUQAA,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. From the story to the acting to the worst Bigfoot costume, most likely bought off the rack @Party City during a Halloween sale. What a waste of money. If you noticed I used the word worst twice I this review. Save you money and sanity . I give this 0 stars. This movies run time is 1hour 40 minutes I turned if off @ 1hour 8 minutes in,  just couldn't take it anymore. Then resumed watching till the end , why i don't know ,
 l guess i like torture . Want decent Bigfoot movies try Exists, Willow Creek or Sasquatch A.K.A. The Untold. And don't forget  the 1972 classic "" The Legend Of Boggy Creek "". One of my personal favorite.",1446681600,,679,4.090225563909774
8653419,1,B00JQYUQAA,"It seems Black Water Creek had a Sasquatch and they captured it and sent it to a zoo in Zanesville, Ohio where everyone sends their Sasquatches, the national depository for Big Foots. It seems Big Foot has escaped and goes back to Black Water Creek to enact revenge by ripping off people's faces. There are a couple of detectives on the case with bad lines and some drug dealers making ""Blue Gold"" who plan to cash in for sixty million dollars.

Our beast looks like a bad guerrilla suit that separates a little in the back at the shoulder. The DVD claims ""some legends are best left alone"" advice the film makers should have followed.

Not worth a free watch.

8653420,2,B00JQYUQAA,"Not a good movie - acting was poor & the creature suit couldn't have been worse or more fake looking, with all the teeth showing as though there are no lips, disproportionate & the suit was Much too big for the wearer of it.
  The story line could have been better, but overall felt I wasted my money on this one.",1439510400,,313,4.114754098360656
8653421,1,B00JQYUQAA,"There in little to no effort put into this movie, the acting is terrible, and everyone that participated should be sacrificed to Bigfoot.",1438732800,,137,5.0
