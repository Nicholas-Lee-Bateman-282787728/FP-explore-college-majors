The cinematography in HD format, the music and everything else is just so perfect. I play this whenever I want to relax and unwind. I have not found anyone else doing this kind of thing with such high production values. A treat for your senses. You really have to see one of these and you'll probably get hooked like me.",1316304000,5,472,4.197802197802198

And very relaxing. I love it. I have a 40 inch HDTV and the fish and the Zen Garden scenery looks sharp and feels like I'm right there. The Koi are vividly colorful, and graceful, and the scenes go on and on, I`ve never seen them repeat... it doesn't loop back the same 6 seconds, like so many of those other cheaper relaxation DVDs. So you get long beautiful shots of several different Koi fish in a variety of settings. I've always wanted to have a Koi Pond in my garden but this is so much easier. No feeding, no work, I can save a lot of money. It`s hard to stop watching the fish, the patterns - it's all so tranquil. Watching my Koi Ponds DVD has got to be the best relaxation therapy I have had in years.
My latest indulgence is to have the Koi Pond DVD playing as a background when I invite some friends over for Japanese Matcha tea. They love it. If I could only have one relaxation DVD, this would be it. All thumbs up here and worth every penny.",1292803200,8,1134,4.159090909090909

8428378,5,B004FV564A,"Earlier this year I started meditating, and occasionally used videos that I found on YouTube.  It was frustrating, though, when the video/audio would freeze midstream, and that was distracting to me.  I decided that I'd search for MP3's that I could use at my convenience without that annoyance.  This is my favorite video - the scenery is relaxing and perfect for contemplative meditation.  I could watch it for hours!  I've enjoyed it very much - well worth the amount I spent, which was less than $5.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates nature and is working on developing his or her own meditation practice.",1386201600,,630,4.841121495327103
8428379,5,B004FV564A,"I've always wanted a koi pond.  This is just beautiful--so relaxing & peaceful.  The very best part about this DVD is that I can watch anytime, rain or shine & I have no upkeep to do on the pond.  LOVE IT!",1369612800,2,205,3.951219512195122

8428381,4,B004FV564A,"At the 20 minute mark is where I really got to see the koi.  The whole video could've been this way because I wanted to see the koi swim.  At the beginning you have a shot of a bridge over water.  It's very nice and kind of adds to the tranquility, but you don't see the koi till later.",1337990400,,286,3.8135593220338984
8428382,4,B004FV564A,The other reviews were right on except I didn't like the fact that you couldn't have just the sound of nature.,1333929600,,110,4.285714285714286
