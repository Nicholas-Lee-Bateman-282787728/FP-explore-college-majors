5187711,5,B008X7JBPM,"I own 5 different prenatal dvds and a few non-prenatal that I modify and at 32 weeks in, this is by far my favorite! It is separated into chapters so you can mix and match your workout. A chapter each for: arms and abs, legs and glutes, cardio and stretching. It is upbeat and very challenging with lots of different modifcations for whatever stage of fitness you are at. Another unexpected bonus is that I will definitely keep this DVD in the mix post-natal.
In my opinion Suzanne's prenatal barre workout is better than The Bar Method Pregnancy Workout because there is a cardio segment, you work each muscle group longer and more deeply and I like that it is more challenging (though you can modify to any level).  I also really love that Suzanne frequently reminds us to pay attention to working our pelvic floor. So important yet so many prenatal dvds leave this aspect out.
I do wish Suzanne's pregnant co-star brought a little personality to the table, rather than a blank stare for much of the workout but now I am just getting picky.",1363910400,5,1042,4.572192513368984
5187712,5,B008X7JBPM,I love this workout! I typically run for cardio and do yoga for stretching/strengthening when I'm not pregnant.  This workout provides both of these - cardio and sculpting in one.  It definitely gets my heart rate up and challenges me while also making my muscles feel the burn!  I currently do the cardio sculpt segment 4 times a week with either the leg or arm/abs workout.  I've had LOTS of compliments on how fit and great I look while being 6months pregnant :),1363824000,5,465,4.566265060240964
5187713,5,B008X7JBPM,"Great work out! I did kettlebell before I got pregnant and this workout had my muscles burning just about as much as kettlebell did! Very impressed with the ease, yet intensity of the work out!",1363737600,3,193,4.542857142857143
5187714,4,B008X7JBPM,"I tried this out for the first time last night, and I felt like it did its job. My thighs and bum were burning, and my upper body got a different challenge. I have take a few barre classes in the past, so I think that helped me with some of the form so I didn't go off into poor form and lose the purpose of the exercises.

Overall, I think this will be a good addition to anyone's prenatal fitness routine as an alternative workout if you don't want to get all sweaty, but want to feel like you're still working some of your muscles deeply. It's way less expensive that other barre workouts out there, so that is another huge plus.",1359590400,2,632,4.138211382113822
5187715,5,B008X7JBPM,This is a great low impact prenatal workout! I love how she walks through everything step by step and I feel like I have gotten a great workout afterwards!,1358812800,3,155,4.379310344827586
5187716,5,B008X7JBPM,I first bought Suzanne's other prenatal DVD and loved it but needed more variety.  I had been doing that one since the begining of my 2nd trimester and got this at the end of or close to the begining of the 3rd.  I am 36 weeks pregnant now and still doing both and enjoying them.  People say I look more fit than I did pre preganacy.  Pre pregnancy all I was doing was jog 2-3 miles 2-3 times a week and wanted to lose weight but now I feel pretty fit for being 9 months along and the father of the baby has noted my butt somehow looks smaller!  I have had some non preganat friends do this DVD with me and they also enjoyed it.  I think Suzanne is a good instructor and not annoying at all and this is not an easy work out which is great!  Anyway I really love this DVD and would not be writing this if I did not think it could help other pregant women stay happy like it has for me.,1358467200,106,884,3.905027932960894
5187717,5,B008X7JBPM,So great for pre and post baby... and even if you're not pregnant.  Great at-home instruction!  Barre workouts are so instrumental in making your body long and lean!,1357948800,7,165,4.857142857142857
5187718,5,B008X7JBPM,I am a huge Suzanne Bowen fan! I am not pregnant and this workout is  extremely challenging !!!! Great if you love Barre or if you have never done Barre!!! She has modifications for each trimester and post  pregnancy!,1357257600,7,217,4.538461538461538
5187719,5,B008X7JBPM,"I love doing Suzanne Bowen's workout videos!  I never get bored and she is such a good instructor!

5187721,5,B008X7JBPM,"This is a great pre and postnatal workout, I used this video for both of my pregnancies and couldn't reccomend it enough. Its great for all fitness levels. Unlike other videos, the instructor isn't annoying and she explains how to achieve proper form.",1515715200,,251,4.8604651162790695
5187722,4,B008X7JBPM,"Bought this DVD at 22 weeks pregnant after getting really sick of my prenatal yoga routine. I felt like I was getting so out of shape and needed something a little more challenging. First workout was today-I did the lower body segment, and I loved how short and concise the workout was, while still being challenging for my body. I followed her guidelines for posture and even followed the third trimester modifications, but afterwards my low back is killing me. I've hardly been able to move all evening... I attribute this mostly to the fact that my core is pretty out of shape right now. I'm normally a super fit, slim and wildly athletic person. This pregnancy is wrecking me! Hoping for improvement in my strength and pain as I ease into this program.",1513209600,,756,4.649253731343284
5187723,5,B008X7JBPM,I run/walk 4-5 times a week and used to lift regularly. I wanted extra with my workouts and was getting tired of the same body weight exercises I was doing. I was sore after the first go around with this video and I plan on doing this 1-2 a week from now on!,1508025600,,258,3.8867924528301887
5187724,5,B008X7JBPM,"This DVD is probably my favorite pregnancy-related purchase. I loved the workouts on this one and would typically do 1-2 for a complete workout. I was in pretty good shape before pregnancy, but did next to nothing for the first couple of months. This workout was challenging and a fun alternative to HIIT and running, which I've really been missing. I started doing these around 10 weeks and am still doing them at 38. I really believe this DVD has helped keep me in shape and I credit her stretching segment for having virtually no back or hip pain during the pregnancy. I love this DVD, but if there were one thing I could change: I wish there were a pregnant woman demonstrating the stretches as well because some of them get kind of difficult with a bigger belly.",1506038400,7,767,4.525179856115108
5187725,3,B008X7JBPM,"Not a bad pregnancy workout by any means. I like that it seems appropriate for all fitness levels. Beginners can go at their own pace, and I'm sure more advanced exercisers can find these workouts challenging as well. However, the workouts featured in this DVD seem to be designed more to keep you tight, rather than show visible results if that makes sense. Like I wouldn't count on these exercises to get you very toned (maybe a little, but not dramatically). Also, as much as I liked these workouts, I imagine it would get really boring to do them the entire pregnancy. Good supplemental DVD, and great for working pregnant women is basically how I would sum it up. The exercises are about 20 minutes each, and perfect for when you get home from work and don't want to exercise, but want to force yourself to do something. You could also do them together if you have longer to spend during the day and don't mind working out for close to an hour. If you're concerned about staying in tip-top shape during pregnancy though, you will definitely need to add other components to your weekly workout regimine.",1504310400,,1107,4.624365482233503
5187726,5,B008X7JBPM,"Three versatile segments that you can do as stand alone 20-minute programs, or do all of them together if you have the energy.  They are tough enough to make you feel like you are working but they don't leave you feeling overexerted.",1503878400,,233,4.5476190476190474
5187727,5,B008X7JBPM,Makes me sweat!  I'm glad to have a DVD that makes me feel challenged without feeling like I'm overdoing it (in the beginning of my 3rd trimester now).  My only complaint is I wish there were more than 3 segments (4 if you count the stretch segment),1502236800,,249,4.276595744680851
5187728,5,B008X7JBPM,"This has been a life saver for me through my pregnancy! I'm just over 8 months pregnant and have only gained 18 pounds. Keep up on this workout, drink lots of water, eat healthy and you'll be set!",1501977600,,196,4.184210526315789

5187731,5,B008X7JBPM,"This is a fantastic workout video. I felt as though it was too easy during the first trimester compared to her regular dvds. In my second trimester,  I picked it up and it was tough. Not so tough I couldn't do it, but it was challenging in a good way. I paired the workout with 2 lb weights which is plenty tough. She does an excellent job explaining posture and providing modifications. This DVD was worth every penny. Suzanne Bowen never disappoints!",1500681600,,452,4.512195121951219
5187732,5,B008X7JBPM,I'm 18 weeks along and these workouts are awesome! They aren't easy at all and have definitely been challenging me. Well worth the money!,1500422400,2,137,4.75
5187733,4,B008X7JBPM,"I am a BeachBody girl first and foremost, and used to HIIT workouts. I have to say that even being fit, these small, concentrated muscle groups and movements left me SORE. Easy to follow with tons of modification options. I totally recommend these videos.",1499817600,,255,4.818181818181818
5187734,4,B008X7JBPM,"This DVD is good but I have moments where I feel defeated by Suzanne's helper who is 2 weeks away from delivery. She looks great and it can be kind of depressing so I don't use this on my ""I feel fat"" days. However, the workouts are good. I am a Jillian Michaels gal and this workout gave me just the sweat I needed. There is a stretching segment that is recommended and each circuit is about 20 minutes plus the 10 mins for stretch. I have enjoyed toning up my body but am not consistent enough to see results right now. I will have to come back and update.",1497657600,3,558,4.081818181818182

5187736,5,B008X7JBPM,Great exercise! It is super low impact but I still get the toning that I want. Some people even claimed I lost weight while using this DVD because my legs and arms were super slim and toned (just like the DVD says!),1495497600,,215,4.142857142857143

5187740,5,B008X7JBPM,"Finding workouts you loved before your pregnancy that are adapted to do safely once you are pregnant is hard.  I was thrilled to find a barre dvd for the prenatal set.

While this isn't exactly like going to a studio, this dvd is pregnancy perfection.  The workouts are broken up into sections- you can do one 15-20 min workout at a time or more, depending on what you feel like.  This made it easy for me to actually do it!

The workout:  It's hard!  Or you can make it easier.  The instructor teaches you modifications for whether you are early in pregnancy or later (or post).

Breakdown:  Nice addition to the standard walking/elliptical/swimming you might feel limited to while pregnant.  Makes me feel like I am getting stronger overall, safely.  Highly recommend",1494547200,,769,4.742424242424242
5187741,5,B008X7JBPM,Love this!! It helped me so much in my pregnancy! It challenged me even though I work out a lot. You can always do it at your own pace as well. I'm definitely doing this in my next pregnancy.,1494547200,,191,3.923076923076923
5187742,4,B008X7JBPM,"Great pregnancy workout. My only turn off about this DVD is that the instructor says it isn't reps she is counting, but it always seems to line up that way. Good indoor workout in reasonable time increments.",1494201600,,207,4.621621621621622
5187743,4,B008X7JBPM,Great workout video to stay in shape. Definitely gets the heart rate going and works up a good sweat. I wouldn't recommend starting this once you are in the middle of the second trimester if you haven't been physically active before.,1493942400,,233,4.7073170731707314
5187744,4,B008X7JBPM,"Once this arrived I was excited to give it a try.  I decided to watch the segments first before attempting and to get a feel for the video/instructor.  I love this instructor and I love that you can use this video through your pregnancy and after.  I was glad to see that there were many options for doing the moves depending on how far a long you are.  It's nice to have options depending on how you are feeling and still complete a workout.
 The instructor isn't pregnant but she does have a soon to be pregnant mama who when shooting this video gave birth 2 weeks later.  I'm not new to Barre as I have been doing it with Pilates for the last couple of months.  I'm excited to continue to use this video as my pregnancy progresses and I can use it after giving birth as well.  If you can get a video to use prenatal and postnatal it's a big score!  If you love barre workouts this is the one for you to use while pregnant.",1493769600,,925,4.122905027932961

This workout is perfect for maintaining balance and working through your limitations as you get bigger without it feeling too easy and basic. I started it in second trimester and it also helped tremendously with sciatic pain I was having. Love how tone and strong this workout leaves you and the segments are short enough for me to complete with my toddler playing nearby.",1492905600,9,602,4.688679245283019

I am 23 weeks pregnant now and I have been having lower back pain with this pregnancy. As soon as I complete the core workout, my back feels so much better and for the rest of the day after the workout. I worked out regularly before I got pregnant and I do feel like this is the perfect level of prenatal challenge for myself. You do have to be mindful of your posture and follow her instructions to avoid injury. I also really listen to my body as I am getting bigger while doing the workouts. Don't push yourself if it does not feel right to not modify the workout. I am unable to do planks at this state of my pregnancy so I modify my planks by using my knees.

The thigh burning in this video is unreal. I do think it's working .. all pregnancies are different so and I've gained tons of weight in previous pregnancies. I have kept my weight gain very low with this one  (baby is healthy and believe me .. the weight will come but no unnecessary weight gain)  at 6 months I can still wear my prepregnancy pants with the button undone.

5187780,5,B008X7JBPM,"I am long overdue for a review of not just this DVD but the excellent customer service I received from Bowen Productions. When I received the DVD, it didn't work and I reached out and contacted the customer service support email in one of the reviews on amazon. Immediately, they wanted to make it right, no questions asked and to compensate me for the DVD not working, I was sent some complimentary DVDs. I truly appreciate the fact that they stand behind their product and truly care about making sure their customers are happy.

As for the workout itself, I'm now in my third trimester and I definitely have noticed that I've slowed down a bit.  I've always been pretty active, I used to run about 3-5 miles about four times a week and then either do barre classes or pilates at the gym twice a week, and some weight training during the week as well. About a couple of months prior to my pregnancy, I had to stop running due to a back injury and so I had to change up my cardio routine by working out on the eliptical, stationary bike and walking on an incline at a moderate pace on the treadmill. By all means, I'm definitely not a hard body. I'm about average height with a normal athletic build and some curves. What I like about this workout is that the instructor constantly checks in to make sure you are checking your posture and form. I can't stand workout DVDs where the instructor is overly enthusiastic and annoying. Suzanne is motivating and encouraging and she has great on-screen charisma which makes the workout segments go quick. I also like that the video is broken down into 20 min segments for arms, legs and cardio so I can choose what I want to do. I can do a segment and then go for an hour walk and feel like I had a full workout. Most importantly, I feel that this is challenging and interesting enough as an add on workout component through the end of my pregnancy.",1478563200,,1893,4.405714285714286
5187781,3,B008X7JBPM,"The work outs are lower body (30 min), upper body and core (30 min) (30 min), cardio sculpt and stretch. No program to follow, it is like going to a 3 classes. I don't particularly like it because it is rigid. No 10-15 min segments. Leah Sarago Prenatal is divided per segment and so it is more flexible.",1478476800,,304,4.258620689655173

Before my pregnancy, I was doing Jillian Michaels' Body Revolution 3-4 times a week and was looking for something to keep me toned and to strengthen my core during pregnancy - and this is it!  I like the variety of the 4 different programs and have been doing one segment, or a combo, every other day and am definitely feeling more toned all over, while also feeling like I'm getting a good workout.  Suzanne is a great instructor who places emphasis on posture and breath - definitely important during pregnancy.  I also appreciate that Suzanne demonstrates what's appropriate for 1st and early second trimester, while her co-star demonstrates what's appropriate for the 3rd trimester so you can easily follow their lead.  I definitely plan on continuing this workout as my pregnancy progresses.",1475193600,5,943,4.90566037735849

The movements are small, but if you have your position/alignment correct you will feel it in your muscles and heart rate. I like how it is divided into parts, so I can do just legs one day and then arms and abs at another time. It was helpful to watch DVD first before I started working out to it so that I can understand position, flow and know what equipment I would need. I have only done it a few times, and I am just in my 20th week, so hopefully my arms will be better defined in a few weeks before I take some maternity photos.",1471392000,,696,4.28030303030303

5187802,5,B008X7JBPM,"I have just started doing this workout video and it was pretty intense. I am used to Jillian Michaels Rip in 30, 30 Day Shred, and One Week Shred. I like running a few times a week as well. I have also done the Insanity Program. I try to work out a minimum of five days a week. Based on a previous reviewer who also said she is used to Jillian Michaels videos, I decided to give this a try. I am only 9 weeks pregnant so Im still doing Jillian Michaels videos and running. However, I thought Id try it out in order to get used to the different exercises before I get too big. The first time I tried it I did all four segments. The Lean Lower Body segment was killer. I had to stop a couple of times because my legs were burning from being the in the ears over shoulders, over hips, over heals as Suzanne Bowen explains correct form. She also keeps reminded you about the pelvic floor muscles and kegles. The Slim Upper Body and Core did challenge my arms a bit as well because the exercises are different than what Im used too. The only segment I was expecting more from was the Cardio Sculpt. This was more sculpting than cardio, which is good, but I was just expecting more cardio from it. However, I think this will be perfect once Im in my third trimester.

The day after I did all four segments I was sore. My buttocks were sore on the outer hip area. It felt like I was working part of my glutes that I hadnt before. My arms also felt a bit sore. I think for now I will be alternating days between the Lean Lower Body and Upper Body and adding my own cardio 3 times a week. And then continue with Jillian Michaels on the other days at least for now. Im still looking for prenatal cardio for when I move into my third trimester.

Id say to definitely try this out, but know that it is challenging especially if you have not worked out before, or did mostly cardio work.",1468368000,2,1874,4.131506849315069

5187807,5,B008X7JBPM,"This is GREAT!  Here are the things I loved about it :
-Suzanne gives variations for different trimesters or levels of fitness
-The video isn't all ""look at me""--meaning, Suzanne gets out of the routine multiple times, goes to the other woman, and shows different things that are happening on her body.  To me, this is INSTRUCTING, rather than just WORKING OUT and letting someone watch.
-The video has good production.  The music really is in the background, there are good camera angles on Suzanne and Leigh-Ann to show different things, and the studio space is nice.
-The workout is good, and you can really feel it!  (As a frame of reference, I'm in my second trimester.  Prior to pregnancy, I was fit, but first trimester had me so sick I couldn't do anything active.  Now I'm getting back into running, yoga, biking and various prenatal DVDs)
-Suzanne often points out tendencies--what your body WANTS to do--and how to avoid those tendencies to get into proper form.
-She continually reminds you throughout everything to pull up on your pelvic floor (kegals) and to lift up through the top of your head.",1466899200,10,1110,4.785340314136126

5187812,4,B008X7JBPM,"I found reviews really helpful when selecting an exercise DVD while pregnant.  Now that I'm 11 weeks post c-section I thought I would share my thoughts.  This review is coming from a non runner and a non gym member.  I would do Jillian Michaels 30 day shred or some cardio kettlebell a few times a week prior to pregnancy.

SUZANNE BOWEN'S SLIM & TONED - This was my favorite of the DVDs I bought.  I didn't really feel like it was difficult until around 28 weeks but I think it did a good job keeping me toned and strong.  The first section of lower body I usually skipped because it didn't feel like it was doing much but the other sections were great.  Suzanne is a good instructor and not overly peppy or irritating.  I would suggest skipping the plank portion of the arm/upper body workout after 25 weeks or so if you're worried about diastasis recti (I was).  It has been a great postpartum workout and I think it will help me transition back to the harder DVDs I was doing pre pregnancy.

PRENATAL FITNESS FIX  - All the reviews are right, the production quality of this DVD is amateur.  However, it does kind of give an intimate, non intimidating approach to working out.  Sometimes it nice when you're pregnant and feeling a little lumpy in your workout gear to look at another woman who is very pregnant and not looking glamourous.  She is also very funny in a goofy way which is good when you're not in the mood to workout.  She gets you going even if you are laughing through it.  I had trouble with the squat portions when she does them very quickly.  It would make my knees sore the next day.  Besides that it was a good, quick workout.

JENNIFER WOLFE'S PRENATAL VINYASA YOGA: SHORT FORMS - I HATED this DVD.  I wish I wouldn't have bought it.  Again, the production quality is bad.  Maybe I'm too used to the GAIAM yoga DVDS but this was terrible.  The instructor reminded me of a new age librarian and the Shavasana was impossible to do with the grating acoustic guitar.  The main reason I bought a yoga DVD was to relax and stretch during pregnancy and this was a mega fail.  Also, it heavily features downward dog, which if you're worried about diastasis recti then you won't want to do this DVD.

EXPECTING MORE: SARA HALEY - I wish I would have found this DVD earlier in my pregnancy.  I didn't buy it until week 33.  It has a plan included to help you make the most of the different sections at different stages of your pregnancy.  I didn't get to explore the other sections as much as I would have if I started this earlier.  Some routines require more space than I had in my living room to move around and some would be great while your belly is smaller but in later stages of your pregnancy it might not be a great idea.  She does do some kinda cheesy things like naming moves after baby things and stressing how sexy she wants you to feel in pregnancy.  The cardio was great though and the best you'll find in a prenatal DVD.  The hip hop dance was too stupid for me to spend time on but if you like dance maybe you'll like it.  Now that I'm postpartum I may try portions of this DVD again.",1464998400,4,3116,4.31551724137931

I had never really committed to this style workout before (having little patience for anything slower paced and a mindset that if I wasn't ""huffing & puffing"" I must not be working hard enough).

I worked out about three times a week solely using these videos starting second trimester up until 38 weeks. I totally believe my pregnancy and delivery were easier because of these videos. Before I got pregnant, I was moderately fit, exercising maybe about twice a week.  These pregnancy specific workouts were just the right amount in terms of challenge and focus on muscles needed/used more so during pregnancy. I continued to do these workouts with the exception of the core workout (I stopped at about 36 weeks only because my baby dropped and I could no longer move my lower body the same way) up until I delivered at 38 weeks. My body felt great and I could have been pregnant longer, I wasn't someone dying to have the baby come out. In terms of delivery, I was fortunate to have a relatively short labor for a first time mom. I felt great when it came to pushing and my body feels great as I'm recovering.

I had to stop in the first section and rest. Before pregnancy I would run and do regular work outs like sit ups, crunches, squats, etc but this was too much for me. I only used it a few times. I would suggest another prenatal work out unless you are use to a lot of strain but I didn't even feel safe with the strain, though it is likely because I wasn't use to these kinds of work outs and how long they would last.

5187832,5,B008X7JBPM,"The best prenatal workout! Suzanne's style is very personable, motivating, yet focused. Not too chatty or perky, it's more informative and instructional. You really feel the burn while keeping it low to medium impact. Amazing results!",1459641600,,234,5.527777777777778
5187833,3,B008X7JBPM,This video is ok but could be a lot better. But i have a few issues with it. 1: She tells you to squat and lunge with your knee going over your toe. THAT'S BAD FORM PEOPLE! 2: Each segment is only 15 minutes so to get a decent workout you have to keep going back to the main menu. I'd rather it be more like my other non pregnancy workout DVDs and have total body workouts all set for me or at least have each workout last longer than 15 minutes. The stretching portion should really be called 15 min of YOGA. seriously I want to stay as fit as I can this pregnancy. This DVD will probably come in better use after I've had the baby or whenever I have to stop running 15-20 miles a week. I say memorize the Abs stuff and do that for the ab portion of Jillian Micheals Ripped in 30 DVD.,1459468800,2,785,3.943396226415094
5187834,5,B008X7JBPM,"I cannot say enough good things about this work out DVD!

I worked out before I was pregnant, and did mostly interval training and light weight lifting, so I wanted something that was intense, yet safe for Baby.  Oh, and I also get very bored very easily, so something non-repetitive is kind of a must for me.

This work-out definitely fits the bill.  It is the right combination of intensity, easily modifiable moves, and the instructor is absolutely great!  I'm almost 36 weeks pregnant with my second child, and I've been doing these work-outs since about my 5th month, when I came across this video online.  I like that all the work outs are broken into 20-25 minute segments so you can easily do one or all, depending on time and activity level.

I do the Cardio Sculpt about 4-5 times per week, and it's REALLY helped me stay in shape throughout my pregnancy.  The moves are easily modifiable, depending on your fitness level, as well as how far along you are-and it's consistently a good work out, every time.  I plan on keeping this work out up after I've given birth to shed the extra lbs I put on during my maternity.

I would highly recommend this DVD to anybody, even my mon-pregnant friends, who are looking for a challenging low impact work-out.",1459382400,3,1259,4.580357142857143

There are 4 workout segments. I wouldn't consider this one.,1457654400,,389,4.342465753424658

5187841,5,B008X7JBPM,"I have always made fitness a priority before getting pregnant and wanted something to have on hand during a winter pregnancy when it's much harder to get out and workout. This DVD has been perfect at every phase of my pregnancy. It was great in the 1st trimester because I was so incredibly exhausted. Instead of making excuses that I couldn't workout this DVD was perfect because the tiny movements don't really take that much energy or time to do, but achieve great results (soreness!). It was great in the 2nd trimester when I had my energy levels back and I would do different combinations of the 20 min segments or all three to get a full body workout. And now I'm 36 weeks pregnant and still able to do these, while unable to do a lot of other things to stay fit. I have tried many different prenatal workouts and find them to be too slow, too boring or too fast for someone that has to keep readjusting a huge belly for each yoga pose. I love that I can do this for just 20 minutes, feel the burn, and actually feel like I'm doing something to stay lean and toned!

She challenges and encourages along the way which is so helpful when you're doing a DVD workout. These exercises help you stay fit and toned throughout your pregnancy and keep your core strong. There are two different levels that allow you to workout according to what your body can handle during the trimester that you're in.

5187848,5,B008X7JBPM,"LOVE this workout!  I was a hot power yoga addict pre-pregnancy, a yoga sculpt (heated power yoga + weights) instructor, and found myself having to cut back when I got pregnant because of a serious lack of energy at first, and later just being too big for my regular workouts to be comfortable.  Once I finally accepted that, I found this, and have been doing it 5 times a week since.  I really think it's helping me keep my muscle tone, but it's not too exhausting or difficult to do (20 minute workouts feel super doable).  It's also super portable for when traveling - just need a laptop with a dvd player and a chair really.  That being said...don't expect an easy workout.  I'm in pretty good shape, and my legs were shaking during the quads portion.  Which is exactly why I love it.  Another plus - you're not freaked out about doing something incorrectly (like I was with other workouts, at least in the beginning).  She's very clear about positioning, engaging the proper muscles, etc.",1455840000,5,993,4.596590909090909
5187849,3,B008X7JBPM,"Once I found out I was pregnant I knew that I wanted to workout throughout my pregnancy. I wanted to find a Prenatal workout DVD that made my muscles work and actually feel like a workout.  After seeing so many positive reviews on this prenatal workout I thought it was just what I was looking for. However, it was not for me.

I was fit before my pregnancy so that might have something to do with it. When I first tried the DVD after 10mins I turned it off. It was too easy. I went back to it again the next day and tried the other workouts. I wasn't very impressed. (I did try this DVD in my 2nd and 3rd Trimester and I still found it easy) There are some moves I did feel which was great, however majority of the workouts she did, were on her tippy toes. I first thought it was just for this small section of the workout but no, its throughout the entire DVD. I am flat footed so doing anything on my tippy toes was awkward and painful. I only felt the workout in my feet and not in my calves or legs. If you are flat footed like me you will not like this DVD.

Sadly this DVD sits in my house unused. I now do all my prenatal workouts from Youtube for free.",1455840000,2,1161,3.9956896551724137

The workouts are short, but feel effective, and I like how she has a modifier to follow to make some of the exercises easier. Music is upbeat and motivating Suzanne does tend to talk a bit during the workouts, but I don't find it distracting or annoying.

When I became pregnant I wanted a safe yet effective workout to keep me strong during my pregnancy. I was a little worried that this would be easy and I wouldn't feel exhausted after the workout, but I was completely wrong! This is tough yet safe. I found my body burning throughout and my muscle were sore the next day! I love this video so much I plan to purchase more of Suzanne's barre workouts after my sweet bundle of joy is born.

5187856,5,B008X7JBPM,"I bought this DVD a week or two ago at 7 weeks pregnant. There are three 20-minute workouts and there is one 10-minute stretch that they recommend you do after each workout. The first time I did each of the workouts I was cussing at my laptop because the moves are way tougher than I thought they would be. I've never done Barre before, but I consider myself a moderately active person. This week is a little better as the cussing has stopped and I pause the DVD significantly less, but it's still difficult and my body aches for days after each workout (in a good way!). Even though the workouts are difficult, I look forward to doing them for the after affects. I feel great & confident in both my health and my baby's health!

5187861,5,B008X7JBPM,"I never did a single barre workout before my pregnancy.  I am a runner and that is my main form of exercise.  I was searching around for a prenatal workout DVD, assuming I'd buy some prenatal yoga one.  Then I came across this.  I was impressed by the reviews so I gave it a shot.  I absolutely love it.  I'm quite sure I am in better shape now at 24 weeks than I was before my pregnancy when I was running 25-30 miles a week.  I've had to cut back on running substantially because it's getting uncomfortable.  Also, it's winter and with the snow and ice, I feel safer keeping my workouts inside.  I also purchased Suzanne's newer BarreAmped Sleek and Toned prenatal DVD.  I like to mix up which workouts I do each day.  The best part is that the workouts are short - most of these ones are 20ish minutes which is perfect if if you just want to do one of them or do multiple ones to make it a longer workout.  As a mom to 2 young kids, this works great for me.  I often also do one workout from this DVD then another from the Barre Amped DVD (all those workouts are around 13ish minutes).  These DVDs are definitely challenging, but there are modifications to make certain moves easier if necessary.  As for the reviewers that complained about the instructor not being pregnant, I think that's ridiculous.  She's done several prenatal DVDs and you can't possibly expect her to keep popping out babies just so she can be pregnant to film these videos.  She has a workout partner in the videos that is pregnant so you can see someone in their 3rd trimester doing these exercises.",1453852800,2,1577,4.364261168384879

I love these workouts because you can customize them by doing one 20-30minute workout at a time or combine workouts for a longer workout. My posture and back feels so much better, back doesn't hurt anymore after doing these workouts for a few weeks. After each workout I feel so good, the little movements are highly effective WITHOUT high-impact.

I was convinced to buy this workout DVD based on the great reviews it had and am glad I did. While I was disappointed that there were not as many workout segments as I would like (I'm a person who needs a lot of variety in order to stay interested and motivated while working out), the workouts themselves are great. Suzanne makes the exercises feel totally doable and easy while you are working out but then waking up the next morning to a sore body makes you realize just how effective her exercises really are!

I love how these three segments are broken down into 20 minute segments. I can put them together, split them up during the day, or if things are really hectic, I can do one workout with the added stretch at the end.

The lower body workout is like no other! It's tough but doable! I was a ballet dancer for 18 years, and unless I continue working out, my once muscular legs become flabby with saddlebags. When I saw that I've already gained 2 inches in each thigh and 4 inches in my hips (I'm 5 months pregnant), I decided to my lower body needs some extra work! I've birthed 6 babies, all naturally, and I know how important it is to have a strong lower body for pushing and recovery.

When I got pregnant I wanted to make sure I was exercising safely for baby, taking the proper modifications and also doing things that will prepare me for a great birth and postpartum period. I love Suzanne gives trimester modifications, proper ab work and I don't have to do any changing of the exercises recommended because I can't lay on my belly or do ab work like in a regular workout class or DVD. She does it all for me and I can focus on my form and listening to my body.

This DVD is a must for every pregnant woman. You get a great workout and it brings me so much peace knowing I'm working my body and not doing anything too stressful for my baby. I've recommended this DVD's (and Suzanne's others) to my pregnant friends and will continue to!

I was in decent shape prior to becoming pregnant but did not work out at all in my 1st trimester due to being so sick. So I started some time in my second trimester, a bit deconditioned, and have found this workout to be very challenging. I like how it's broken up so you can do 20 min at a time, depending on how much time you have. I have a toddler and the way my husband's schedule works, do not have the oppurtunity to go to the gym very often. I get up early before work to do this - the point being it's nice to have something to do in my living room that isn't loud but still helps me break a sweat. It has a bit of light cardio but is mostly toning. I do feel like it's help my legs and butt stay strong, and there is a lot of emphasis on keigals and tightening those pelvic floor muscles which is super important.",1445126400,3,959,4.026178010471204

It's just challenging enough and you can pick and choose which workout you want to do. II used this DVD interchangeably with another one (sleek and toned) of hers and found that gave me everything I needed and more. I LOVED how my body looked through out my whole pregnancy. I worked out until week 40. ""Sleek and toned is the slightest bit more challenging. Oh, and Suzanne is not annoying. She talks you through without talking too much.",1444348800,5,612,4.5225225225225225
5187895,5,B008X7JBPM,Love this DVD. Great prenatal workouts. You think it looks easy and you're not really doing anything but if is definitely a workout...complete with tons of muscle burn.

5187896,5,B008X7JBPM,"I'm in the end of my fourth month and I was very active before my pregnancy, running a mile daily and seeing a personal training for lifting at the gym two days a week and lifting on my own probably two more days a week. I got very nauseous and fatigued until about my fourth month and exercise pretty much went by the wayside. I've been walking a mile and a half at least three days a week but I wanted something more intense for more calorie burn and sculpting so I ordered this. After the leg workout today, I am jelly. I couldn't complete all of the reps for each of the exercises because they were tough! But I think that's ok and it will strengthen my endurance. A quick Google says a barre dvd burns about 400 calories an hour, so I did one segment and stretch and I am going to add to myfitnesspal a 200 calorie exercise for the day. I'm pretty happy after the first workout and definitely achieved a cardio sweat glow. I will update this review if anything changes going forward!",1443052800,,988,4.26063829787234
5187897,5,B008X7JBPM,"I started using this DVD in my second trimester as a way to build and tone my muscles. I have to say, I enjoy the workout and I like how the sections are split so that if I only have time to focus on one area, I can do that. Prior to my pregnancy I took barre classes in person, but that being said, I think anyone could do this video and get a good workout. They do a good job of explaining the exercises and modifying them for your ability.",1442707200,,442,3.868131868131868
5187898,5,B008X7JBPM,"I love this DVD.  This workout (if I do all 3 portions) is really difficult for me - currently in my second trimester.  I was a 20-mile / week runner before my pregnancy, but have given that up for shorter, slower walks since my first trimester (I was really wiped out) and I wanted a safe alternative that still felt like I was working hard.

I find these exercises really challenging, and I always feel great afterwards (and sore the next day!).  It has been a fun way to keep up with strength training without having to be outside in the heat.  My husband always kind of chuckles at pregnancy workout DVDs, but I'd like to see him try to do squats while standing on his toes... :-)

I don't always have time to complete all three portions at once (I have a toddler...) but even if I just have time for one I still feel like Ive accomplished something.

I have another one of Suzanne's prenatal DVDs (Long & Lean, I believe) that I used during my first pregnancy.  I really enjoyed that one as well, and still occasionally use it, but this one is more challenging and feels like more of a workout.",1442188800,,1099,4.326829268292683

5187900,5,B008X7JBPM,"I bought this DVD because of the great reviews. I started while in my second trimester and I have been using it 2-4x/week into my third trimester. Other than going on walks and a couple hikes, I totally stopped working out (NO gym or running) in my first trimester because of the fatigue and nausea. Prior to pregnancy I worked out 2-3x/week of light cardio and had slacked off on the sculpting. When my thighs and bottom started expanding I knew it was time to get active, but not overdo it. My muscles burned days after doing this video the first couple of times which I thought was surprising for a prenatal DVD. However after sticking with it I find the workout energizing and very toning. Suzanne is the perfect instructor and I love how she constantly reminds you to tighten your pelvic floor without being annoying. I have gained a total of 8 pounds at 28 weeks and I feel great. I swear my butt looks better than it did pre-pregnancy and I'm complimented regularly on my fit preggo physique (not just by the fiance). Also the fact that each segment is only 20 minutes leaves little excuse to not do at least one daily.",1441929600,,1126,4.470873786407767

I was pretty fit before getting pregnant and towards the end of my first trimester I decided I needed to focus my efforts better.  This is great.  I have strong legs and have been able to do the more challenging version of the lower body throughout (but I still feel it for sure), but I am not able to do the entire upper body workout with my 3 lb weights even having been doing it for a month or so.  But I am getting better, and I think it is a strong workout.  She is good about having modifications and trying to keep you focused on posture too.",1441756800,,612,4.024793388429752

5187907,5,B008X7JBPM,"Wow, what a humbling experience! After being an avid exerciser and faithfully using Beachbody workouts before pregnancy I was looking for something that would still challenge me during pregnancy. This fit the bill! I had never tried Barre workouts before so I was a little skeptical but this workout has me shaking and sweating every time! I try to keep my workouts about 30-45 minutes or less so I do the lower body segment and cardio sculpt on one day then the upper body/core and cardio sculpt on a different day alternating with some other prenatal workouts. I absolutely love/hate the burn I get with these workouts.

Initially my DVD would only play the lower body segment. Even though I was outside of my return/exchange period I contacted the company about a replacement because I hadn't used the dvd while dealing with morning sickness. They were MORE than accommodating by setting me up with a free digital copy while I waited for my replacement which came in two days. Also, they offered to send me the new BarreAmped prenatal workout which I would have accepted gladly had I not already bought that one too! (Which I would give 5 stars too for quality) but I think I like the set up of this one a little bit better. Edited to add that the company said that they had a batch of dvd's where about 1 on 50 were defective. The recent negative reviews in regards to DVD quality could definitely be attributed to that problem!

So 5 stars for the workout and 5 for the company for their customer service. I will FOR SURE be incorporating Suzanne Bowen's other Barre workouts post-pregnancy.",1440979200,6,1596,4.656028368794326

However, 8 weeks into my fourth pregnancy, Jillian's workouts were becoming too uncomfortable.  My husband purchased this for me, and I'm soooo glad he did! I used this DVD 3-5 times per week during my pregnancy. Now a month after baby has arrived, people are constantly telling me how amazing I look, that I don't even look like I had been pregnant.  I'm in better shape after the fourth baby than I was after the first, second and third!  My legs definition that they have never had before, my behind lifted and firm!  I loved this DVD because it was so doable for me. The mix and match segments allowed me to get a workout in even on my busiest days.  I am even still using this DVD during the postpartum period.

I have used different prenatal workouts through my different pregnancies, but here in the last year, I got interested in Barre and thought ""if I ever get pregnant again, I'm going to give their prenatal workout a try and if I like it, I'll consider doing the ""real"" thing post partum.""  Based on my previous experiences with prenatal workouts, I was expecting a boring, easy peasy, barely get your heart rate up video.  I was so pleased to be wrong.  I did the lower body workout first and my legs were ON FIRE.  The upper body workout also had me crying out in pain.  The cardio is very simple and not really cardio...there is a lunge section that gets your heart rate up pretty good, but that's about it.  However, in the cardio sculpt workout, you're back to working your legs again, and while it's not as intense as the lower body workout, your legs will burn.  Overall, this is a fantastic video.

At the same time, I'm sweating at the end of each working segment.

So glad I did! I mainly focus on the Cardio Sculpt and the Lean Lower Body sections. Both are very focused on the lower body, so doing both back to back makes for a challenging 40ish minute workout. It's not easy by any means, but I never have any hesitation or dread doing it. Plus, she shows you the modifications to make once your pregnancy and your belly progresses. After a couple of weeks I can already tell my legs and hamstrings are getting stronger, and I'm enjoying this workout so much more then incline walking or the elliptical at the gym.

There are 3 series; a core, cardio and legs and a final stretch that she encourages you to incorporate after every workout.

5187948,3,B008X7JBPM,I watched this once just to see what kind of activities I'd be doing and to be honest it took me 2 weeks to get motivated to start because it just looked boring. I usually do very intensive exercise so this is not what I am used to. But when I finally decided to try it I struggled a bit (4 months pregnant) and best of all I was sore the next day so it must do something for you.,1432944000,3,380,3.7625
5187949,4,B008X7JBPM,"I'm a soccer player who, prior to getting pregnant, did a variety of strength and cardio workouts five days a week.  I started Slim & Toned in my second trimester, having continued my regular workouts throughout my first trimester.  I honestly thought this would be boring and easy but was pleasantly surprised to find my legs burning and my breathing quickening after the first workout in the cardio series. I did this workout 2 - 3 days per week throughout the rest of my pregnancy (into my 41st week!).

I was really skeptical about a workout that you can do at 10 weeks and 35 weeks - I mean, either at 10 weeks it's too easy or at 35 weeks it's too hard, right?  Nope.  She provides options to make it more or less challenging.  She also has an assistant who, at the time of taping, is 35 weeks along so that as you get bigger, you know what your form should look like.  Speaking of form, this is very important to Suzanne.  She's great about reminding you not to arch your back or lean forward and to focus on your pelvic wall.  Oh yes, that pelvic wall:  In my first trimester I read about how important it is to strengthen your pelvic wall, especially for after you give birth (I mean, horror stories of peeing your pants, unknowingly, the first time you attempt to jog).  I was told to do kiegels every single day, for at least 10 minutes a day!  What's great about this video is that every single motion in this exercise requires you to life and strengthen that pelvic wall.  It's been a few months since I gave birth, I have resumed soccer and have not peed my pants yet!

Highly recommend this for your full pregnancy.  In fact, I actually did this workout this morning because I wanted something low impact (injured my neck in soccer) and was very satisfied!",1432684800,6,1771,4.406153846153846
5187950,4,B008X7JBPM,"I have been using this workout since my second trimester when I stopped running and was unable to walk daily. It is quite a workout if you keep proper alignment as instructed. I have mirrored wardrobes which really help, and if you don't have a mirror, I'd invest in one to ensure proper posture.

The video and Suzanne are very engaging, and I don't tire doing it every other day.

The only parts I do not do are some of the mat work exercises (like planks and other push ups) because they work muscles which can exacerbate abdominal separation during pregnancy (Diastasis recti). However, I do utilize all the exercises which encourage strengthening of the lower abdominal wall which engages a different set of abdominal muscles which are used to alleviate this condition should it occur.",1432684800,4,790,4.801470588235294

It's nice to see someone in their third trimester who looks so fit and is exercising right along with you. I really enjoy the way this workout makes my legs and arms look afterward. I almost feel like my legs are more toned now than they were before I got pregnant. I'm currently in my first trimester and the arms section is really intense! Production value is nice too: the workouts take place in a brick loft with natural light; the background music is not overly intrusive; Suzanne is very pleasant to exercise along with.,1432512000,,626,4.548672566371682

Obviously they have some serious quality issues so regardless of how good this DVD might be, it's a waste of money at $8 per use, then it's done with. Very disappointing! The two times I used it, it was good. Not necessarily a challenge if you were already in shape and I don't think it is a substitute for actually getting to the gym and working out, but it is nice for the days when you just can't make it into the gym. I am currently 24 weeks pregnant and although I do not find this a challenge at all, I am a super fit woman, pre pregnancy.

It's really a good pregnancy workout DVD when it works, though it can be a little hard on the knees. Had this for a week past the return window when it suddenly stopped working in my DVD player for no reason. Not a scratch on it, but it sends the player into conniptions and returns it to the main menu every time. Had heard about this from other reviewers and hoped it wouldn't happen to me. I'd say 4 stars for the DVD countered by the shoddy functionality.

After work, I alternate doing 2 of the segments, or even just the cardio if I'm short on time. On weekends, I do the full 60 minutes plus stretching.

Even after doing this video 15-20 times, I'm not irritated by Suzanne. That's  saying a lot. Most videos I have to mute after the third time because the commentary is annoying.

I find this video challenging and effective, without being so difficult that I avoid doing it after a tiring day at work. I am a huge Suzanne fan now. I just ordered her latest Barreamped Prenatal video and can't wait for it to arrive the day after tomorrow!",1429315200,2,816,4.3202614379084965

The work outs are challenging enough that I feel like I'm doing something great for me and my baby, but it's not so difficult that I feel uncomfortable, over worked or just so intimidated that I don't even want to workout again the next day.

Suzanne Bowen is a wonderful instructor.  She is very pleasant. She give easy to understand and follow instructions, while continuing to do the workout.  I appreciate that.  And while she is talking the entire time, I never feel like she is ever saying anything unnecessarily.

The pregnant woman that's modifying the exercises is also very pleasant and does a great job at the exercises.

I own about 12 other (non-pregnancy) workout DVDs and this one is by far the most enjoyable.  I highly recommend it.",1428278400,3,833,4.696551724137931

5187983,5,B008X7JBPM,"This was my favorite new purchase this pregnancy.  In my previous pregnancies, I only did cardio and light toning at the gym.  This time, I finally gave in and purchased a few fitness DVDs and I'm now a total convert... after discovering how much I loved this routine, I went shopping for a few postnatal routines and some other DVDs to transition to after I finish those.  I honestly believe I'm more fit than I've ever been and I only gave birth about a week ago.

I started this routine in my second trimester, doing varying combinations of two segments each morning (alternating with the ellipital).  All throughout the second trimester and even into the third trimester, I noticed that the exercising were getting easier and my husband commented on a noticeable improvement in my muscle tone.  I wasn't even doing the exercises at the hardest level, so I know this would have been a good workout even if I had been more fit to start.  By about halfway through the third trimester, I had to start decreasing the intensity (following the modifications) and, in the last week or so, was down to only doing one segment each day, but I was still able to continue this workout right up until the end.  I know it's hard to compare, but this was my easiest and quickest labor and I felt even better immediately after giving birth than I ever have before--I believe some of the credit for that has to go to this DVD for doing such a good job at toning my core.  I plan on using this DVD interspersed with another during my postpartum recovery and look forward to using it if I am ever pregnant again.",1427673600,17,1596,4.494809688581315

It's nice to have an exercise regime that you actually look forward to doing! The instructor is nice but very precise and focused on you getting the most out of your workout. There's only one other lady in the video so it's less distracting.",1427328000,,550,4.401960784313726

During my first pregnancy I couldn't find great DVD's  for at home workouts and I resorted to swimming everyday, which was fabulous but my body got used to it and I felt there as no muscle toning. Prior to becoming pregnant the first time around I did P90X (twice and I was ripped!), P90X3, T-25, a bit of Exhale Core Fusion, played Tennis and did Yoga. I was fit.  Now in my second pregnancy, I vowed to do more resistance training and this DVD kicks my butt!! It's not easy and boy does it burn. The first time around I was sore for 2 days. The instruction is great, the workouts are great and I will be doing this in combination with swimming right up to when I am going to deliver. P.S. I bought tracy anderson's prenatal workout and don't like it as much this DVD -- too much floor work on all four and legs shooting everywhere -- I thought I was going to pull an ab muscle or tear something around the baby.

This DVD gave me more sculpt/tone then when I wasn't pregnant! With my first child I gained 70 pounds, and really wanted to keep in shape to avoid this. I am now 3 days post partum, and gained 19 pounds during my pregnancy, much thanks to exercising frequently. I have aleady lost 11 pounds, and only have 8 pounds left to go. Again, this is at 3 days post partum.

I went natural with my labor, and my Midwife couldn't believe how quickly/easily the pushing stage was for me. I told her that I did a prenatal pilates dvd that focused on the pelvic floor, and she said ""well that explains it."" I pushed 3 times and she was out. I was upright and walking around 20 minutes after delivery, and didn't feel like I gave birth!

I have taken barre based classes in the past but not at a real studio.  I found the exercises easy to get the hang of and modify.  I especially like that the exercises in this video don't but any pressure on your lower back but still really make you feel the burn in your legs and arms.

She also doesn't push you too hard and tells you to listen to your body which I like.  I find the lower and upper body and core workouts more challenging than the cardio section but I usually never do more than one twenty minute section and the stretching section at a time but if you started in great shape doing two or all three of the 20 minute sections will definitely satisfy your workout needs.  Purchase was well worth my money and I can see myself using this workout without modifications after my pregnancy.,1425254400,,633,4.675675675675675

I alternate with this one and the Summer Sanders DVD. However, when I started this one I instantly fell in love with it. I have done all the Jillian Michael's workouts and this one really targets those areas that don't get worked very much. I am already noticing a difference in numerous areas that I have tried to tone before. It is a great workout that really makes you feel that you did something.

5187998,4,B008X7JBPM,I really like this video.  I was fit prior to getting pregnant and this video forces me to slow down while still getting a little sweat on.  It uses a lot of little leg muscle fibers for all the segments but I love that about it.  The girls on the video don't annoy me either like most videos tend to.,1425168000,2,301,3.9833333333333334
5187999,3,B008X7JBPM,This was my very first Barre workout so I didn't know what to expect.  I found it to be too long and intense.  Who wants to be pregnant and sore?

I have a growing library of prenatal exercise DVDs, but by the time I was 5 months into my pregnancy I was sick of using resistance bands and hand weights for boring bicep curls and triceps extensions.  This DVD came to the rescue.  It is challenging, but allows the option to adjust each move to your own level.

I enjoyed this video so much that I have purchased several other Suzanne Bowen DVDs and can't wait to use them to get back into shape after baby.",1425081600,6,609,4.353982300884955

5188003,5,B008X7JBPM,"Love this workout program!  Comes with three different workouts, plus a stretching segment.  Each one is about 20 minutes or so, which means you can quickly work out in your living room whenever you have half an hour to spare.  Workouts are good for all levels of pregnancy.  After I first started the program I was sore afterwards...& I consider myself to be in good shape!  You don't need any equipment other than a mat, a chair to hold onto, & a set of light weights (2-3 lbs.).  I don't even wear shoes while I'm doing it!  The only complaint might be the lack of workouts included, but if you do all three each week & add your own cardio (walking/jogging) one day a week, I'd say it's a pretty sufficient pregnancy workout routine.",1424736000,,736,4.447761194029851

I knew I wanted to workout my whole pregnancy but couldn't seem to find the right way to do it. Running started to bother me... And most DVDs don't give me enough of a workout. This one is awesome. I sweat, I feel tired and strong, and I love that I am six months along and can still feel like I am working out without jeopardizing my pregnancy. I combine the cardio and arms and then stretching most days. About 50 minutes total... But doable, fun, and not boring. I love this DVD!",1424563200,,615,4.176470588235294

5188009,5,B008X7JBPM,"I was very impressed with this video. I lost 33 lbs before I became pregnant by counting calories and working out to Juliane Michels videos. I had stopped working out for about four months prior to becoming pregnant so I was hesitant to began a work out video now that I was 3 months pregnant (7 months without working out). The cardio seemed really slow and I felt like I wasn't doing much but the next day I could feel the difference. Now that I am almost five months I am exhausted after doing the cardio and upper strength segments. There are three segments: cardio, upper strength, and lower body strength. Each 20 mins long. There is also a quick stretching segment for after excersising. The excersises are performed by  Suzzanne Bowen and a woman in her third trimester. I feel very safe and the excersise alterations (including adding a chair for support and balance) for third trimester I'm sure will come in handy. After researching MANY prenatal videos, I'm glad I chose this one.",1423785600,,992,4.668571428571428
5188010,5,B008X7JBPM,"I really love this workout video. It's low impact but really targets your pelvic floor which can be weak after multiple babies. It is broken into three 20-min segments which can be done separately or combined for a longer workout. There also is a stretch segment at the end. I recommend combining this with cardio in earlier parts of pregnancy, but it is nice to use alone in later parts of pregnancy when cardio becomes very difficult. I read mixed reviews when purchasing. One commented about the woman not even being pregnant. The only segment that is not accompanied by a pregnant woman is the stretch segment at the end. Otherwise, she has a 35 week pregnant woman with her and shows/tells how modifications can be made for late pregnancy. If you like ballet barre workouts, I recommend this.",1423440000,,797,4.741007194244604

5188013,5,B008X7JBPM,"These work outs are legit, whether you're pregnant or not! I've done all kinds of different toning work outs over the years and this is far and away one of the best. I've seen results in my legs and butt with only a month of doing these that I wasn't able to get with months of doing other weighted exercises. The upper body/ab routine is also really great, which I didn't expect. Upper body work outs usually give me a horrible headache, but I can do this one and never have any problems, plus I can tell I'm getting stronger! I'm really excited to try some of her other DVDs after baby comes! I'll keep this style of exercise in my rotation from here on out.

The one thing I've not been super impressed with is the 'cardio' routine. I was doing Turbo Fire and running 4-5 miles a week before I got pregnant, so for me the cardio just didn't cut it for what I wanted cardio to feel like. It is a nice leg work out though. I've continued to do some of my older Turbo Jam DVDs for cardio throughout this pregnancy just because it feels like I'm actually working a little more.",1423008000,5,1076,4.223300970873787

At 25 weeks the extra weight started to make my normal workouts too taxing on my feet and leg muscles, so I purchased a few Pre-Natal DVDs to try.  This was the only one that actually made me feel sore after my workout and made me feel like I was exercising... the others were just too wimpy.  I really like Barre (I've never tried it before) and I really like Susanne Bowen's style- I plan to look for more of her workouts post-baby.",1423008000,4,700,4.496062992125984

I highly recommend Suzanne Bowen's prenatal workouts for anyone who is looking for a more challenging prenatal workout.  The barre method definitely lengthens and tones - I even think my legs are going to be in better shape postnatal ;),1420675200,,414,4.802816901408451
5188022,5,B008X7JBPM,"VERY happy with this DVD purchase.  I was debating between this and Tracy Anderson, and decided to go with this one.  It's the perfect level for me - I'm fit, but not crazy fit and I just wanted something that made me feel like it took effort and kept me in shape, but not so difficult that I dreaded doing it!  I've been doing the videos 2-3 times a week and really love everything about it - the fact that she has different things you can do to make it harder/easier, that she acknowledges that it makes your muscles ""burn"" and the best part, are the different segments you can choose.  I love that I can do just one 20 minute segment and feel good, or do 3 when I'm feeling energetic and have the time.  I'm really finding the flexibility of it makes me do it more often, not to mention it keeps things interesting.  I'm only 15 weeks now, but I know I'll be doing this until the baby arrives!

I did this video for the first time last night and I am sore today! Not a bad sore, just enough to know that I worked hard yesterday. My heart rate never raised very high, but the exercises used in this video were great for toning muscles. I did the upper body and cardio sections, which took a total of 40 minutes. I am excited to try the stretching portion and lower body portion. This is a good complimentary video to anyone who wants to continue working out during their pregnancy.

5188024,5,B008X7JBPM,"This is the first review I've posted on Amazon, because I feel that strongly about this product! I was doubtful of a home workout DVD, as I have been doing a few different ones that promise stellar results since my son was born 15 months ago. I've used a few different Jillian Michaels workouts, and a few others that were fine, but nothing to write home about. Now 20 weeks pregnant, and about 2 months into this DVD, my husband tells me I have never been in better shape. I even lost a pant size and firmed up my lower body and arms while packing on the pregnancy pounds. I love this DVD, LOVE. Love that it's broken into three main segments, each about 20 minutes long, so I can get a quick workout in during a short nap, or a full body workout in during long nap. And, the best part is I am working super hard but not sweating, so I can stop mid workout if need be and continue on my day. I have Suzanne's other non-prenatal DVD's ready to order for when I'm able to do more strenuous, hard-hitting workouts.",1420502400,6,1012,4.221649484536083
5188025,5,B008X7JBPM,"I bought this based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews and now it's my turn to add to them.  I've been doing the pre-natal workouts on this dvd regularly for the last 8 weeks (months 4 and 5) and love how they feel during and after.  There are 3 about 20 minute workouts and one 10 minute stretching segment to add at the end of your workout.  I usually combine one of the workouts with a pre-natal yoga one (Element: prenatal and postnatal yoga, also bought from Amazon and highly recommended) and love how I can do a whole workout including stretching in just 30 minutes.  What I like best about the workouts is how simple they are, using just poses and gravity, requiring no special equipment or complicated moves, and yet they work your whole body, raise your heart rate and stretch your muscles all at the same time.  You don't need a barre, but just a chair and some handweights for the upper body workout (although I used candlesticks because I don't have any handweights!).  You don't even need a yoga mat, although it's nice to use one.  I feel like the workouts have helped keep me slim and toned the last two months despite holiday cookie indulgence.  I recommend this workout no matter what stage you are in pregnancy or out of pregnancy, I expect to keep doing this video regardless of being pregnant or not it is such a good, quick and effective full body workout.",1420329600,34,1382,4.522088353413655

I wanted to make sure the work-outs I was doing were pregnancy safe since I am a first time mom and wasn't sure how to modify my current routines. My pilates instructor friend told me about the barre method and how great it is for toning so when I found this dvd online I ordered it right away. It is great!! I am actually a little sore as a write this review now (but in a good way). The routines are about 20 each so just doing 2 is still a great workout! The leg toning is just amazing--I've never experienced a workout quite like it and the best part is you can modify the moves as your belly gets bigger.

3. I could and did use these workouts all three trimester and postnatal
4. I found Suzanne's teaching style and attitude to be enjoyable and her cues and explanations very helpful

I still use it (9 weeks post delivery) when I can sneak in a quick 20 minute work out while baby is sleeping.

She is thoughtful on how she describes them and gives very useful demonstrations with herself and another pregnant woman. The workout is complete and very challenging strengthening workout working all the muscle groups. She provides useful suggestions on how to customize the workout depending on your trimester or if you are post-partum. I think her emphasis on how to visualize and do kegels is also very important and I think is often overlooked in other prenatal exercise videos. So I commend her on that. She helps you get a good workout while being mindful of what you are doing.

I also really liked her videos: Long & Lean Prenatal Workout, and her 10 minute Pilates Solutions.

I to be fair I also really loved the challenge of Jennifer Wolfe's Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga and Short Forms, and The Perfect Pregnancy Workout. But after using them over two pregnancies I was bored and needed something different and up to date.

They are also great for pregnancy because there is no bouncing around, but the workouts do WORK. Instead of large movements, the instructor has you holding your poses and doing your reps in really small movements, pinpointing the spots where you need to tone. It makes the other workout dvds with larger movements seem like you are wasting movement. I was quite surprised and impressed by how challenging it was without being a complicated or boisterous workout. As the instructor says, ""It doesn't look like much, but it is challenging if your form is correct.""

I also like how it is instructed bare-foot - I hate putting my sneakers on in the house!

When I am not pregnant I am in pretty good shape. I do not like to gain more than 20-25 pounds while I am pregnant. I am 5'6"" and 168 right now, at 29 weeks - just to give you an idea of where I am coming from.",1414540800,12,1002,4.469945355191257

The exercises are 20 min. long and you can do more than one if you have more time or need more of a work-out.  All in all this was a GREAT buy and I would totally buy it all over again.

When I was 10 weeks I developed a subchorionic hematoma and was placed on modified bed rest with no activity until the hematoma went away 2 weeks later. During my 2 weeks of no activity I gained 5 lbs. I started this workout at 13 weeks and have actually lost a pound (I don't know if it's from this or from being off the bed rest). My muscles are sore each day after doing a workout, and my butt and thighs feel stronger. I love how the arms, legs and cardio activities are separated out. Suzanne is very motivating, she laughs and says she feels the burn of using these muscles, and she isn't even pregnant.  Each section is about 20 min which is perfect for me after working all day; I still can work out and then play with my older son.",1409961600,,886,4.211764705882353

This is a good prenatal alternative...none of that pansy stuff you'd get with some of the other prenatal workouts.

If, however, you're looking for a workout that is highly cardiovascular in nature, this may not be the best bet.

My standard complaint with most prenatal workouts is that there's not much of a workout- as in, not much of a sweat; minimal challenge. This one completely took me by surprise! The movements help to strengthen all of the muscles that a pregnant body really needs, and I love how Suzanne gives reminders on proper form and the typical ""cheats"" that people tend to make throughout. I am new to a barre type workout, and keeping up the form is the biggest (yet most rewarding) challenge.

I started this workout at Wk 20 and did one segment each morning until my delivery date at Wk 39. I got great result - no back pain, very little swollen leg during the whole pregnancy. And it took only 20 minutes each day. At the beginning, it was quite challenging but after a few weeks, even my belly became bigger, I found it became easier and I could even use a heavier weight for the arm exercise.

The instructor is excellent. I ended up buying another prenatal workout from Suzanne, which is 40 min long for my weekend workout. And after my baby was born, I used Suzanne's barr-amp bootcamp and found it equally effective.",1406592000,4,734,4.42962962962963

5188070,5,B008X7JBPM,"This is a tough set of 4 workouts; upper body, lower body, cardio and stretch.  I just received it the other day, and plan to do 1-2 workouts + stretch a few times per week.  As a personal trainer I would personally not recommend this video for newbies to working out, this is tough, the positions are a little awkward (a lot of time is spent on the balls of your feet) and Susanne moves FAST.  Of course, you can always modify the movements and take breaks when you need to, but I don't think a newbie would find the video very enjoyable.

Anyway, onto the good - this DVD is awesome for those of you who are already have a good level of fitness; there is zero time wasted at the start/end of each video, Suzanne goes straight into the workouts, and she leads from one exercise to the next.  I can see this DVD lasting throughout the remainder of my 6 months, plus post pregnancy.  As others have mentioned, she gives useful tips, and doesn't waste time cracking silly or annoying jokes.  The 4 workouts appear to range from 20-30 minutes in length, and stretching is about 10 minutes, so its easy fit 2,3 or all 4 into a workout session.

Upon receiving the DVD, I would highly recommend playing the DVD and just skipping through the various videos to get a feel for the movements you'll be doing and the amount of space you'll need - like I say, she moves fast, so there won't be time for making adjustments once you've started.  You'll need a yoga mat, a pair of weights (1lbs, 2lbs, 3lbs, or 4lbs) and a chair for some stability.",1405641600,4,1534,4.335664335664336

I began swimming in the third trimester but it was getting boring and I could feel that I wasn't doing enough toning to my arms and legs although getting a good cardio workout. With only four weeks to go in my pregnancy and not liking the appearance of my arms and legs getting flabby, I found this DVD with good reviews on Amazon and I'm glad I did. The workouts are very doable and I like how they're split up in segments of twenty minutes.

In mainly all of the other prenatal workout DVDs, the instructors say the cheesiest things about being pregnant and the baby which would annoy me so much that I didn't want to work out.

With this workout DVD, you know you are doing a prenatal workout and that you should be doing certain exercises to help with your pregnancy and labor, but Suzanne instructs you in a way that isn't corny or annoying at all. After completing the workout I feel great both inside and out and I know my baby enjoys it as well.

segments are about 20 minutes long, with a 10 minute stretching segment at the end, all very doable and the video definitely doesn't drag and drone on. This is one I'm excited to do every time, because I feel it almost immediately.
From my experience a lot of prenatal DVD's talk about getting fit, but stay very cautious and also talk a lot about the baby. This video made excellent modifications depending on trimester without making it ALL ABOUT BABY. I don't know about you, but often times when you're pregnant that's all people talk about, so it was nice to be able to work out as 'just me' again, and not making all these references like 'connections with baby' and 'baby is really loving this workout!"". ..personally when you hear that for 9 months it gets old.

There's a huge hole in the prenatal workout market regarding cardio because many prenatal workouts neglect this because they are keeping it so low impact. I wish someone would make a low impact cardio tape that actually gets us sweating! I don't think Suzanne does this intentionally, but the moves that are presented in the video are more muscle/toning based. Each of the segments are good workouts and get me sore the next day, lots of leg work in most of them and the arm segment definitely tones the arms. It's a good supplement to another cardio routine.

It is a great, short but intense workout that allows you to pick which sections you do if you have more/less time or want to work a specific area.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I thought it didn't have as many barre exercises as I expected, since it is in the name.

There are three different workouts that are only 20 minutes apiece. It was important to me to stay in shape while pregnant and in my eyes, this DVD delivers.

I used to run 3-4 miles 4 times per week and work out with weights 3 times per week, but have gotten to the point where this is no longer comfortable (I'm in the beginning of my second trimester with my second child).  I've purchased a couple of videos in addition to this one and I really like this.  I've done all of the segments and agree with previous reviews....this video as a whole focuses heavily on lower body toning (I was most surprised by this during the cardio segment).  While the cardio segment does get my heartrate up a bit, more time is spent on toning work.  It's not bad, but if you are used to intense cardio work, this may not be for you.  Overall, this is a good video to keep you in shape during your pregnancy and a good workout to help ease you back into an exercise routine after delivery.

Each section is about 20-30 minutes, so you can choose what to do when you don't have too much time. I usually pair up 2 sections to do in one day. The movements are simple, easy to learn, instructions are very clear and make a lot of sense.  And it really works!!  I started when I was 26 weeks, now I am 32 weeks, my arms and legs are trimmed, the only thing growing is my baby belly, not myself, and I am not having any back pains any more like when I was 26 weeks. Also the stretching section helps relax your muscles that you just worked out, very simple but effective.  I am very satisfied with the product, and highly recommend the dvd.",1398384000,6,765,4.291666666666667

I lifted weights regularly before getting pregnant, but I have a high-risk pregnancy so I had to find a workout that didn't strain my body too much. This one is perfect! I even love the look of my body better now than before pregnant! I will keep this DVD in rotation after the baby is delivered, for sure!",1398384000,,436,4.329268292682927

5188109,4,B008X7JBPM,I purchased this video shortly after finding out I was pregnant but unfortunately has a miscarriage so only used it up until about 12 weeks.  So I can't speak to the difficulty/ease for later in pregnancy use but can give a little perspective.  The cardio workout is definitely not much for cardio but rather a very leg toning focused workout.  Since I was looking for something with more cardio I was a little disappointed by that fact but if you can accept the workout for what it is it's actually pretty good.  My other issue is that Suzanne isn't actually pregnant in the video which to me is always a little strange.  I mean how do you teach a good prenatal workout when you are not actually pregnant?  She does however have one woman in the video who is so that helps.  Lastly I think you could totally do this workout not pregnant and it would still be good.,1396224000,,865,4.40251572327044
5188110,5,B008X7JBPM,Great workout video for pregnant woman. I love the arm and leg workout and definitely feel the burn during and after each workout. I love the instructor and all the modifications based on how you're feeling that day. Would recommend it!,1396137600,,236,4.780487804878049
5188111,5,B008X7JBPM,"Highly recommend this DVD.  I have tried about 6-7 other DVDs, and this one is by far the best.  While it's certainly not a hard workout compared to non-pregnancy work-outs, but it gives a good workout.  The cardio section really isn't going to get your heart rate thumping, but has some valuable exercises.

The DVD has a menu where you can select the upper body, lower body, cardio, or stretching workouts.  They are all about 20-30 minutes, except the stretching which is perfect for doing during the week.

The instructor on the DVD does a fantastic job explaining how to do the moves and making sure you're not falling into any of the pitfalls of doing the moves the wrong way.",1394755200,2,682,4.595041322314049

5188113,4,B008X7JBPM,"Definitely gets your heart rate up during the toning segments. However, a separate cardio workout is necessary as the cardio segment is a lot of lower body toning, rather than the standard cardio workout. Great workout overall.",1394409600,,227,5.162162162162162

I was a very fit woman before pregnancy and wanted something that challenged me while building up pelvic floor strength. I have gifted this DVD to several pregnant friends already. A must have.

This is a great overall workout, and I love how the workouts can be broken down into shorter specific sections (upper body & abs, lower body, and cardio sculpt) so if you are short on time you can choose one section or if you have the time you can do all the sections. Suzanne is not annoying at all and explains the moves clearly. I highly recommend this for a challenging, fun prenatal workout. I also like the Bar Method pregnancy DVD and have recently tried the Tracy Anderson Pregnancy Project DVDs (which are also pretty good). I keep coming back to this DVD, though.",1393372800,6,717,4.398496240601504

5188120,5,B008X7JBPM,"For this video, you will need a yoga mat and 2 - 3 lb weights.

If you like barre workouts, this is a great workout that you can do at home while pregnant and without a barre.
These are the reasons I like this video:
- clear instructions for the exercises.
- focus on core and kegel exercises.
- modifications for people in the 1st trimester vs 3rd trimester.
- there are 4 sections (~ 20 minutes each) so you can select which workout(s) that you want to do for the day.
- I feel strong and energized after completing the video.
- helped me with my lower back pain",1393200000,2,564,4.127272727272727
5188121,2,B008X7JBPM,After reading the other reviews I was excited to try this workout. I am currently 20 weeks along and still exercising as I was before pre-pregnancy. This includes running and various Jillian Michaels and Bob Harper DVD workouts. I am not new to exercising and at this point in my pregnancy still want a challenge. This DVD was not it. I have several other prenatal DVDs and I have yet to fine something that will deliver a challenge. The quality of the DVD was fine and the workout was ok....just not what I was hoping for. I will continue with my regular workout regimen and make modifications as necessary.,1392940800,2,608,4.587155963302752
5188122,5,B008X7JBPM,"I just completed this workout from start to finish (all three segments, and the stretch.)  I was nervous that it was going to be too difficult, but I didn't find that to be so at all. (It was a challenge, but in a good way!  Not too strenuous.) I found the Cardio Sculpt segment to be the most challenging, but definitely still do-able.  I found Suzanne to be very encouraging and informative.

For reference I am currently 16 weeks pregnant, and prior to pregnancy was doing Physique 57 regularly.  I think this will work perfectly to keep my strength up during pregnancy, and to compliment the rest of my prenatal dvd's.  (I'm also using Tracy Anderson's pregnancy project 3x per week, and Suzanne's other dvd, Long and Lean!)  I find Suzanne's style to be more challenging than Tracy's prenatal set, which is much welcomed, because I do want to maintain my strength and stay fit.  This will absolutely be going into my weekly rotation, and I feel that with both of Suzanne's dvd's, plus Tracy's dvd set, and cardio, I have a perfect pregnancy fitness plan. :)",1392681600,2,1062,4.641711229946524

5188124,5,B008X7JBPM,The workout is challenging and I find Suzanne's personality to be not to overly hyper or laid back.  She has just the right balance of energy.  I always feel like I've gotten a great workout when I do her videos.,1392336000,,212,4.275
5188125,5,B008X7JBPM,"UPDATE (7/14/14): I'm now 38 weeks pregnant and have been using the DVD since I was 15 weeks. Originally I alternated it with a pre-natal pilates  video, but I soon found I liked this workout much better. Now, I do this 4 times/week with 30-minutes of brisk walking on the off days. The workout is more challenging now that I'm bigger, but it's still very doable and keeps me feeling in shape. I'm hoping all the focus on the pelvic floor will also help in labor and delivery! I have used the modifications more as I've gotten bigger, but the only exercise I feel I can't do is the nagler (sp?--the outer hip one) stretch--my belly is simply too big!

ORIGINAL: At 15 weeks pregnant I had to give up my gym membership. I'd been doing cardio and weight training about four times a week and had always enjoyed barre classes, so this video seemed a good choice.

I've been very happy with the purchase. The routines are challenging (legs definitely burn in the lower body track) without feeling impossible. The length (each section is 20 minutes) is also perfect: easy to combine or just do one. It feels like good attention is paid to muscles used in pregnancy and childbirth. Suzanne explains the moves clearly but keeps a quick pace. Appropriate modifications are noted for later in pregnancy.

My only complaint is that the cardio track is barely cardio; it's really just another lower body toning track. If you're looking for real cardio, this won't do it. I never break a sweat in any of the tracks, but my arms and legs are plenty tired.

Nonetheless, a good choice for fit to reasonably fit women. At 17 weeks I'm still pretty small, but I think I won't have a problem continuing with it throughout pregnancy.",1392249600,2,1714,4.588235294117647

I think after the baby comes I will continue with some of Suzanne's other Barre workouts.  The only thing I noticed in the video is that Suzanne's pregnant counterpart in the video either looks tired or annoyed, I am not sure which one.

5188135,5,B008X7JBPM,"This DVD can actually be quite challenging, in a good way.  Having danced quite a bit and built up a bit of leg and ab strength, I'm glad I can continue to be challenged in those areas even during pregnancy.

I like that there are two versions shown with each exercise - a modified version for 2nd and 3rd trimester (performed by a 3rd trimester woman) and a more challenging version for 1st trimester, post-partum, or even for non pregnant people (performed by Suzanne Bowen herself).

I like watching the very fit 3rd trimester woman - who has such a nice fit frame - she's a real inspiration that you can still be quite fit and strong and not have too much excess fat despite growing a baby bump.  I also like that the exercises are challenging enough as is (while doing the modified version) that it seems like a good go to DVD even after having a baby (to try out the more advanced version of the exercises!).

There's 4 different segments to the DVD, so you can pick and choose which ones you want to do, or how many you want to do, and that's a nice feature.

I also like the focus on your pelvic floor and toning that - it's one of those things so often talked about, but how do you actually strengthen it?  This DVD will you help you do that, along with strengthening other areas of your body to prepare for delivery.",1389225600,15,1326,4.301204819277109

This is my first prenatal workout video and my only complaint is that the cardio seemed way too easy.  I would say I reached maybe a 3 on the RPE scale.  I'd like to get to a 5-7 range.

I ran a marathon the month before I got pregnant, and once second trimester rolled around, and I felt more like exercising, walking and elliptical were getting a bit boring (especially as the cold weather moved in and my workouts necessitated the gym.)  This workout video incorporates muscle toning routines that left me a bit sore the next day-- so I know it worked!  My heart rate was elevated, and I started to sweat, but not enough to need a shower, which was convenient.  I did the whole workout (three segments plus the stretching part), at once and it was do-able-- but you can also do one or more 20 minute segments, depending on how much time you have to work out.  All I needed was a chair for balance and some 3 lb. weights (which I had from doing the Tracy Anderson Method DVDs).  I also bought Suzanne Bowen's Long and Lean to mix it up.  Will let you know how I like that one.  I also have Shiva Rea's Prenatal Yoga DVD from Gaiam, which is a nice low-impact yoga workout.  I'm happy with my collection thus far!",1383609600,,1187,4.509345794392523

Although Suzanne herself is not pregnant she does have a pregnant lady there to give modifications, and you know that Suzanne has been pregnant before.  She is very professional and give great reminders on form and things to do to protect your body from injury.  And lastly this workout is kick butt! You will work all muscle groups in ways that are very effective and safe for pregnant women while also still feeling challenged and like you actually worked out.  There is a great stretch at the end.  Love this workout!",1383523200,,550,4.639175257731959

5188158,4,B008X7JBPM,"Suzanne is fun to watch and motivating. Out of all the pre-natal DVDs that I purchased, this one is the most used. Workouts are short but powerful.",1383264000,,147,4.481481481481482
5188159,5,B008X7JBPM,"Let me say that I've purchased, at this point in my pregnancy, a significant number of DVD's for prenatal excercise of all kinds and generally manage to workout 4-5 times a week.  I am just starting to get bigger, I'm 18 weeks now, and I am not experiencing many of the aches and pains I did with my last two kids during pregnancy.  This in spite of the fact that I am on baby #3, and started out overweight (but active). I believe that Bowen's emphasis on gentle abdominal toning in this and her Long & Lean Prenatal workout are largely to credit for this. I liked the Long & Lean workout so much I purchased this DVD as well because of the instructor's low key demeanor and excellent instruction (and because honestly any DVD gets boring after you've done it enough).  I also alternate a yoga DVD once a week for the stretching and breathing benefits, but this one since I purchased it about a month ago has really been my go-to.  The 20 minutes followed by a stretch for me is the perfect length and fits into my busy routine nicely.  I plan to do this up until birth and postpartum.  Really highly recommend this DVD.",1383004800,40,1121,4.365384615384615
5188160,5,B008X7JBPM,"I knew I'd have to adjust my fitness routine when I got pregnant, and was bummed to give up the high-intensity, high-impact Jillian Michaels-style interval workouts I was used to. I stopped running at about 4 months, when it started to feel weird and uncomfortable, and I continued to do some of my old workouts (with modifications) through the 5th or 6th month. I bought several prenatal workout DVDs (this one, Sara Haley's Expecting More and Erin O'Brien's Prenatal Fitness Fix), and this has turned out to be my favorite.

These workouts are great. There may not be jump squats involved, but my muscles are fully spent and I feel satisfied each time. They're short, sweet and to the point; challenging yet easy to follow. The moves are pretty basic, but they allow room to challenge yourself to go a little deeper each time and really perfect your form (all the while knowing you're being safe for the bebe).

The 20-minute cardio will get your heart rate up, but is very leg-heavy -- definitely more of a strength-plus-cardio rather than a cardio workout. I do the cardio sculpt 3 times a week, followed by either the lower body segment or upper body segment for a 40-minute workout. The back-to-back legs is killer, but I love it. On the days between, I do some cardio from Sara Haley's DVD (which is great for that).

OK, the really awesome part? The RESULTS! I started incorporating these when I was about 16 weeks, and now at 33 weeks, I swear my body is more toned than it was before ... slim and toned! My glutes are like razorblades that my husband pretends to cut himself on whenever he brushes up against them. My thighs look great, my arms are svelte and strong, and even my calves are more defined. In fact, not gonna lie, I feel downright hot ... which is a great way to feel when you're knocked up!

Finally, Suzanne is a great instructor. Her cuing is excellent, and she gives good information without being annoying. She seems to know just what you need to hear and when you need to hear it.

I probably wouldn't have tried something like this if not for pregnancy, but I think this DVD will forever change my workout preferences. I'll definitely be ordering some of Suzanne's non-prenatal DVDs for post-baby.

5188161,5,B008X7JBPM,"I exercised pretty heavily before getting pregnant (Turbo Fire, P90X, Insanity).  So, I wanted something to do during pregnancy that was a challenge -- safe, of course -- to satisfy my competitive athlete just a bit.  This DVD has been just that!  I hadn't done much barre work, so it was nice to learn something new.  And the strength and tone workout I get from these is really great.  I usually just do one of the workouts and add on the stretch for a great 20-30 minute exercise routine.

5188162,5,B008X7JBPM,"I love this workout video. I'm in my 2nd trimester and this video really gives me a nice, but not overwhelming workout. I've been doing prenatal yoga with and Erin O'Brien's prenatal workout for the past month and half ~ which I am happy with, but I wanted to get in more of a workout for my arms...and this video works my arms for sure! The leader is not annoying. She's not pregnant, but there is a woman in her 3rd trimester doing the workout along side her which is awesome because you get to see the workout moves tweaked for when you are farther along or not as physically advanced and you get to see the workout at it's fullest so you can do this even when you're not pregnant and still get an awesome routine out of it.
I get nervous when ordering videos because I'm afraid that the instructor is going to be too peppy/annoying or the routine is going to be too easy or too unrealistic, but I really happy that I purchased this DVD.
So far, I've only done the arms and stretching, but I watched the cardio and lower body sections and can't wait to do them. Love this DVD and will definitely be using it throughout my pregnancy with my other workout videos, and bonus ~ I'll get to use after pregnancy!",1379894400,5,1209,4.283842794759825

My other pregnancy workout video is good (yoga) but it feels more like stretching and relaxing, where this is a workout!  I will keep doing it after the pregnancy.

There is a girl to follow for pregnant woman (in 3rd trimester like me) and Suzanne does the more advanced moves.  Same moves just small variations.  I really like that it is broken into 3- 20 minute sets with a 10 minute stretch at the end. I would say I am moderately in shape and it is tough but not too tough.  You can do as much as you can fit into your schedule, though I like to try to do the whole thing at once, it is good for mornings you are short on time.  There is a section for legs/butt, arms, and cardio.  This REALLY burns your legs and arms, though the movements don't look like much you can really feel it.  I would recommend.

The only section I don't like is the lower body section. I'm sure it's great for keeping you in shape, but it's just too uncomfortable for me as you have to keep yourself on the balls of your feel almost the entire time. But I love the rest of the sections, and find I still get a good leg workout from the cardio section (and a pretty good sweat)!

I love how fast the workout seems to fly by for me. Also, I love that it really gets me to break a sweat and gives me a great workout, without feeling like I'm overdoing it (since I'm very pregnant).

My first trimester, I felt horrible and didn't do a lot of working out, so I lost what little muscle strength I had. I like this DVD because you work muscle groups to the point where you feel like you're toning them. Suzanne Bowen is great at providing less intense and more intense variations of the exercises. She also reminds you to take a break when you're tired. That's what I do, and I get a great workout.

I don't feel like I get a lot of cardio from this DVD, but if you're interested in toning your arms, legs, or core while respecting the limits of a pregnant body, this DVD is great!",1376006400,8,759,4.227586206896552

I already use Summer Sander's Prenatal Workout (which I love overall and is cheaper than this DVD), but I wanted to add more variety. Slim & Toned is great when it comes to strength training, however the ""cardio"" segment is basically just more lower body work. I was extremely disappointed.

Also, Suzanne makes certain comments that, if your are 27+ weeks like me, sound a little rediculous. For example, during the stretch portion, there is one move where you are supposed to pull your leg into your chest. Um...say what? I have a big belly in front of me! I couldn't even get a proper stretch with that particular exercise because it simply isn't designed for women in their 3rd trimesters.

5188175,2,B008X7JBPM,"I was disappointed for several reasons with this video:

1. The main leader IS NOT EVEN PREGNANT! She's huffing and puffing away and telling me how to make my workout more challenging. Not what I need to hear from a perfectly toned UNPREGNANT woman when I'm 30 weeks pregnant. If a pregnant woman tells me what to do to make an exercise more advanced (like in the Perfect Pregnancy Workout) then I think, okay, I can do this. When Suzanne tells me what to do, I just want to slap her.

2. Most of the video is leg work! I did the lower body section which was an awesomely hard workout. Then I went to the cardio sculpt segment, and it was just a bunch of leg work (lunges and squats) AGAIN. I didn't even finish that segment. I don't want to be so sore that I can't walk tomorrow.

3. At one point Suzanne tells me to put my hand on my belly and feel my abs. Has this lady even been pregnant???? I can't feel my abs under three pounds of baby and 20+ pounds of amniotic fluid, placenta, and water sac. Not what I need to be reminded about.

4. At one point, she has us do a FULL FORWARD FOLD. I've done a lot of research on how to modify my vigorous yoga class for pregnancy since there is no prenatal yoga offered here, and everyone says NO FULL FORWARD FOLDS! It made me doubt the safety of some of the other moves she has us do that I'm not as familiar with.

I give this video two stars because it definitely works you out (even though it's boring), and I was sweating after 40 minutes. But overall, not impressed, especially after all the other glowing reveiws.",1375401600,17,1566,4.189368770764119

This is a little harder than I first thought it was, and I'm pregnant and hormonal LOL Anyway, I think this is a good workout program. I still think the stretching section could be a lot longer and more in depth. And I still don't like the fact that the 'coach' is wearing a super low cut top.

And don't let the prenatal in the title fool you, I can see myself using this after birth for sure! Overall, great video.",1371859200,,400,4.569444444444445
5188195,3,B008X7JBPM,"I had never done barre before, but this is my new favorite prenatal workout. Each segment is 20 minutes long so you can do one or more depending on how much time and energy you have. They do a great job at making your muscles burn and getting you sweaty without making you completely out of breath. I've only been doing these for a couple of weeks and I am feeling stronger and more energetic already! There are modifications for each exercise too, to make it harder or easier.

Edited: I think some of the exercises might not be the best to do once you are further along (like planks - I remember this feeling really awkward and not good). It may or may not have anything to do with this video, but I ended up delivering really prematurely with this pregnancy after going to a healthy 40-41 weeks with my first two. I have to change my review because I am not 100% sure this video is safe during pregnancy. That being said, I will keep the video to use as an un-pregnant person because I actually love the workout and it makes my legs look awesome.",1371600000,3,1049,4.297979797979798
5188196,5,B008X7JBPM,Although I haven't been able to use this as much as i had hoped...I love it! It's a great workout and I plan to keep using this video.  Its actually enjoyable and goes by quickly.,1371513600,,179,4.114285714285714

5188198,4,B008X7JBPM,This was a great work out.  I felt the burn and was sore the next day!  I am in good shape and have always excercised--I found this DVD to be more challenging than mose prenatal work outs.,1370390400,2,188,4.054054054054054
5188199,5,B008X7JBPM,"This is my favorite prenatal work out DVD so far. You can choose between 4 workouts; one of which includes a stretching/cool down routine. No matter what the routine there isn't a lot of ""stand here...get on the floor...stand up...sit down....get back on the floor"" commands. This can be challenging with a big belly to contend with. I find all other dvds to have back and forth instructions which are completely annoying. You can modify the movements depending on your fitness level and still get a fantastic workout. This is my go-to workout!",1370390400,4,544,4.860215053763441
5188200,5,B008X7JBPM,"There are three workout segments and a stretch segment to do after your workout. I like to do all of them together, but on days when you have less time, you can choose what body area you want to focus on. Suzanne is very positive and fun to workout to. She warns against things you shouldn't do and gives adjustments for people in a lower trimester vs. third trimester. The workouts give a good burn without straining your back, neck, or joints. She has fairly good flow, though you will have to adjust your props between segments, but it isn't a big problem. I can definitely feel it the day after her workout, but in a good way. I recommend this for sure!",1369785600,,657,4.349593495934959
5188201,5,B008X7JBPM,"I am in my second trimester with twins, and this is by far the best ""feel-good"" workout I've done!  It's not over the top, but it gets you finding muscles that haven't been used for awhile.  I love the layout of this DVD, and her demeanor is great throughout the whole video.  Instead of ""pushing"" you, she tells you to take frequent breaks and then get back into it.  I felt that this workout is very safe and effective for me at this point in my pregnancy.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try to stay toned during their pregnancy.",1369785600,3,547,4.271844660194175

5188203,5,B008X7JBPM,"I am a regular gymer, and always have been.  Now that I am midway through my pregnancy, some of my workouts are getting more difficult, so I bought this and the Long & Lean Suzanne Bowen DVDs to supplement my workouts.  This one killed me a little on the first try.  A new workout always will, but I was still concerned it would be too easy for me; it wasn't.  The only thing I didn't like is that you need some equipment, and I didn't realize that when I bought it.  You need a chair for balance and barbells.  Just a heads up.",1367798400,10,528,4.077669902912621
5188204,5,B008X7JBPM,"This is a great DVD for people who were somewhat fit before pregnancy and looking for a challenge.  I have found most other prenatal DVDs to be too easy for me, but this one feels like you are actually getting a workout.  Love that the DVD is split into segments so you can do all or once at a time.",1366848000,3,299,3.966666666666667
5188205,5,B008X7JBPM,"I purchased this video several weeks ago after reading the great reviews on Amazon.com. I have to say that the reviews were very accurate, and I am very satisfied with my purchase. I was a regular exerciser before becoming pregnant, and I wanted something that felt somewhat challenging (i.e., not just stretching). This video is definitely a challenge! I have done it probably 7 times so far, and each time is just as challenging as the first. I like that the video is broken up into segments (legs, arms and core, cardio, stretching), so that I can mix and match for some variety. I definitely recommend this video!",1366502400,2,617,4.722222222222222
5188206,5,B008X7JBPM,"This is my favorite pregnancy workout that I have so far, and I've purchased several DVD's since I found out I was pregnant. I'm going into my fourth month of pregnancy and get a great workout with this DVD. I can tell my thighs, buns, and arms are benefitting from it. It's got a cardio sculpt section, a lower body section, and an arms and core section, plus a stretching sections. I alternate doing the cardio/lower/stretch and cardio/upper/stretch combo and don't get bored. I love that almost all of the work is standing and there is not a lot of pressure put on your knees and hips (which I experienced with Tracy's Pregnancy Project). Overall, I highly recommend this DVD!",1366243200,3,679,4.666666666666667
5188207,4,B008X7JBPM,"I am finishing up my first trimester of my first pregnancy.  Everything is new to me!  I used to be in sick shape; spin class 4 days a week with interval runs and strength training  on my ""off"" days.  First trimester knocked me off this pedestal.  I could barely manage a 30 minute walk daily between the nausea and exhaustion.  When I finally started feeling better, I decided I needed to take a different approach.  No longer a cardio queen, I decided the barre method might be perfect for pregnancy.  After calling a few local studios, all telling me they do not do prenatal classes, I started searching for DVDs.  I have a 10-minute pilates DVD in my collection starring Suzanne and I always liked her (even though pilates bore me to death!!). I am very happy with my selection.  There are four workouts, 1 upper, 1 lower, 1 stretch and 1 cardio.  I did each workout once thus far over the last 4 days in addition to my 3 mile walk.  My triceps are killing me, and my glutes feel like I have an old sports injury I am walking off.  I am pleasantly surprised by this, though secretly appalled at my lack of fitness after only 2 months away from my old routine.  This is definately something I will keep up through my pregnancy and Suzanne's co-star is quite a healthy body inspiration.",1365465600,11,1288,4.425531914893617

I definitely feel a burn in my legs despite the DVD being extremely low impact.  The cardio sculpt and the arms are my favorite sections!

I didn't think a slim core was possible in pregnancy and I guess I was right. The last selection is a stretching session so not really a workout. Kinda pricey dvd for just two workouts, although the two are good.",1527552000,,343,4.212121212121212

I had a low lying placenta and was told to rest for 6 weeks and even though I was eating extremely healthy, I had put on weight. So now I'm 23 weeks in and I got the clearance from my doctor and the placenta went up, so I brought this DVD and within 2 weeks my weight is now under control and already my body feels firmed up especially the glutes and thighs ; D love the variation in this and you can combine it with upper body plus lower body or either one with cardio sculpt for a 40+ min workout on your good days, or 20 min workout on your not so good days.
