1051537,4,6305610355,"A friend who's on a SWAT team called me up saying ""You have to see this movie!  It's the real deal!  At least the first half...""

The first half of the movie, tactics and gun-handling are top-notch, realistic, and the way that tactical teams are actually trained.  But about halfway through the movie, the entire thing changes.  Suddenly SWAT guys are shooting from the hip, marching out into open areas in the middle of a fire fight, it makes no sense at all.

Apparently, there was a switch of directors, producers, or something part way through production and it shows.

I think it's out of print, but if you find a copy, buy it!  Just for the first half, the tactics are that real.",1221177600,,685,4.467741935483871
1051538,3,6305610355,"The film has a nice idea, I knew it as soon as I saw its poster. S.W.A.T vs. HRT, what a brilliant action sequence would be seen in the film! But it failed. The producer had to write it out that real SWAT members and tactics were showed in this movie, or I would not know that!

There was 1 out of the 3 stars for the idea.",1102809600,,323,3.75
1051539,5,6305610355,"This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  The movie really shows the tactics of real life SWAT operations and is a nice change from most other movies.  Trust me, this movie is a must own for any SWAT fan.",1056499200,,220,3.8666666666666667
1051540,5,6305610355,"I happened across this film one day when I was bored, and decided to rent a few movies at the local big name video rental store. I do this from time to time, that is, rent unknown films to see how they are. I was REALLY surprised.
The film involves an FBI investigation of possible vigilante cops. A bunch of slime are being killed on the streets in what appears to be military-style executions. The opening scene shows exactly what I mean, as a drug-lord/pornographer and his gang are wiped out by a group of MP5-toting paramilitaries, who turn out to be SWAT cops.
The acting is excellent, and the action sequences are top-notch. I can't believe this wasn't released for the theatres. It would have probably done well. Michael Rooker and several other fairly well-known actors make up an excellent cast.
I purchased the DVD when it was available, but alas, is now out of print. If it becomes available, I would suggest that anyone get a copy, you won't be disappointed.",1053820800,,971,4.618497109826589
1051541,5,6305610355,"An amazing piece of work. It is uncanny how much more impressive movies that actually pay attention to tactics and methods used by law enforcement are than your standard hollywood flic. Great fight scenes, perhaps a slightly stale plot but the sheer brilliance of the action sequences makes it a must own.",1035504000,,305,4.884615384615385
1051542,4,6305610355,"If I were a member of a specops unit, going against a trained SWAT team, I would know how they think, and would change my tactics accordingly.... the OPFOR should have set AP explosives at the most likely breach area, and coordinated overlapping fields of fire...",996710400,,263,4.739130434782608
1051543,5,6305610355,"A band of killers feeling they are serving humanity go out annihilating criminal organisations because they believe that the justice system is too slow - there is too much red tape. Rogue Force, or Counterforce as it is named in Australia, is a great movie and I would recommend it to all. I by-passed the profanity and violence to actually see the believable and action-packed plotline.  This movie I imported from the US because we can only see the rentals here in Aus. I am a big Robert Patrick fan and am so pleased the powers that be have seen that he is an actor of substance and deserves roles of this calibre (so to speak).",986860800,,631,4.439655172413793
1051544,5,6305610355,"Great movie. Its about a SWAT team that gets fed-up with their hands being tied at work, and the outbreak of crime, and want to set the record straight. They accomplish this by going out on their own, and adminishering a little bit of street justice, or vigilanteism if you will. If you like shoot-em ups, this is the one for you.",981417600,2,330,4.338709677419355
1051545,2,6305610355,"This film's story is identical to MAGNUM FORCE, Clint Eastwood's 1973 sequel to DIRTY HARRY.  As in MAGNUM FORCE, ROGUE FORCE is about a group of cops who turn vigalante.  Then a tough, but ""by the books"" cop,  confronts them.
ROGUE FORCE features wooden one-note characters.  That's  how they're written, and that's how the actors play them.  Nobody changes  or grows, except for the FBI man, but only at the very end.  He suddenly  discards his police gear in disgust, much like Eastwood did with his badge  in DIRTY HARRY.
ROGUE FORCE's stolid FBI agent hero looks and acts more  like a meathead bouncer than the smart FBI agents played by David Duchovny,  Jodie Foster, and Kyle MacLachlan.
There's also a stolid ""Tony Danza  type"" Italian cop who's recruited by the vigalante cops, led by a  sterotypically evil Aryan type cop.  The Danza type accepts his new  vigalante role, without any great soul-searching.  No one questions their  decisions, no one grows, no one changes.  Femme cop Diane Dilascio  heroically rushes into a shoot out at film's end -- and accomplishes  nothing.
The stupid hero cops fail to outsmart the villain cops.  Then  the villain cops stupidly rush into gunfire and accept their inevitable  defeat with stolid blandness.  One note all the way.
Yes, the final  shootout is bloody and lengthy.
One star for the elaborately bloody  shootout, and one star for Diane Dilascio, who's always cast in one note  roles, although her succubus in POLTERGEIST: THE LEGACY shows she can do  more.",957312000,,1515,4.900793650793651
1051546,5,6305610355,"This is the coolest movie I've ever seen!  The first time I ever saw this was on HBO (this movie *I believe* also goes by the name, 'Renegade Force')...and after that, I would stay up until all hours of the night just  to catch it again! First of all, I love Robert Patrick!...If you liked him  in Terminator 2, than you'll love him in this! He plays a disgruntled  S.W.A.T captain, who uses his team to clean up a  town full of prostitution  and corruption, but ultimately goes over the edge and loses any of the  values that he has....although he is SUPPOSED to come off as a cold  vigilante, you can't help rooting for the bad guys in this...the hero to  his anti-hero, Michael Rooker (guy from Days of Thunder)...is also somewhat  of a prude...which helps you not feel guilty about the chaos that stems  from the his 'rogue' squad of swat team members' brutal killing...but  asside of that, this movie is still AMAZING...the weapons, equipment,  costumes, and manuevers in this are great (This movie used actual FBI  equipment, guns, and advisors)...this film is extrememly violent, but  almost in a mezmarizing way...the action scene's in this are so amazingly  exlposive, and so soberingly realistic, that it will make any other movie  with swat teams in it look like Pokemon...if you like automatic weapons and  explosions, then this is the movie for you!  If you like any movie  concerning law enforcement, or just great action movies in general, then  this is the movie for you!  Buy it, no matter how much it costs...you WILL  NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!",950486400,9,1557,4.749063670411985

7892040,5,6305610355,"I have to say that throughout the confusion of action movie stars the three in this flick are mens men . I will have to backtrack for one ,the Italian looking dude, Louis Mandylor ? ,the guy that has paths to choose from Patrick and Rooker but this movie is tight . It's not over the top nonsense . The action is believable but still movie-like . Thank God . I also liked the morality play . This movie had some epic qualities . A nightmare unfolds as SWAT goes rogue . Rooker is the good guy . Kick and enjoy !",1374969600,,511,4.019607843137255

Great, Robert Patrick was great in this movie, highly recommend if like The Unit,",1358985600,,139,4.833333333333333
7892043,5,6305610355,"An excellent b-movie, and way underrated. It shows Robert Patrick ( Terminator) facing off and going head to head with Michael Rooker, SWAT-style.

This movie is about a local SWAT team, that takes matters into its own hands and executes criminals that the courts failed to put behind bars.

In the long run this leads to a confrontation with the FBI's HRT and...............lots of casualties.

If you like to watch how 1990's SWAT teams work, this movie is for you.",1345507200,,467,4.8125
