560171,4,6303102506,"Jimmy Stewart stars as James McNeal, a Chicago newspaper reporter assigned to investigate the Prohibition-era murder of a policeman. Two men - Frank Wiecek and Tomick Szaleska - were convicted and sentenced to prison terms of 99 years.

But Wiecek's mother Tillie, a Chicago scrubwoman, has raised five thousand dollars scrubbing floors in the hope of reopening the murder investigation. Her ad in McNeal's newspaper catches an editor's eye and McNeal is assigned the story. Eleven years after the trial, Tillie Wiecek tells McNeal, ""My boy is innocent.""

McNeal is skeptical of the story and he doesn't like the idea of ""freeing a cop-killer."" But he digs further after his initial story attracts a lot of reader interest. He finds that the police want this story to go away and that they'll try to stop his searching for proof of Wiecek's innocence. The film dramatically depicts McNeal's dealings with the courts, the police, and the Illinois Parole Board. Director Henry Hathaway used real Chicago locales to give this film its black and white grittiness. Stewart gives a fine performance, helped by an able cast and an interesting story. Fine film, worth seeing.",1036713600,3,1167,5.072916666666667
560172,4,6303102506,"Call Northside 777 takes us to Chicago during the early 1930's Prohibition era. The narration throughout the film, especially at the beginning, gives the viewer a vivid feel for the setting of the film.
The murder of a city police officer sends Frank Wiecek (Richard Conte) and an accomplice to a 99-year prison sentence. More than a decade later, Chicago Times editor Brian Kelly (Lee J. Cobb) notices a classified ad in his paper, offering a $5000 reward for information about the ""real"" killer(s) of the police officer. Assigned to investigate is reporter P.J. McNeal (James Stewart.)
As the film progresses, McNeal's initial sure feelings about Wiecek's guilt become blurred. The headstrong McNeal seemingly does more work on the case in a week than the corrupt police department, seeking a quick conviction and closure of the case, ever did in 1932.
McNeal responds to the ad, placed by Wiecek's mother, Tillie Wiecek, who works as a floor scrubber at Chicago's Wrigley Building. Ms. Wiecek emphatically pleads her son's innocence. A still unconvinced McNeal warns her about scam artists who may try to fraudulently obtain the reward money.
The film heats up as McNeal becomes engrossed in the case. A series of newspaper articles about Wiecek's proclaimed innocence lights up the switchboard at the paper, in support of McNeal's work. Given the positive response, Editor Kelly orders McNeal to stick with it.
A key point in the story is McNeal's legwork in locating witness and store owner Wanda Skutnik, whose testimony helped to send Wiecek up the river.
This film introduces a couple of new technologies of the time. Polygraph inventor Leonarde Keeler appears as himself, his only appearance in a feature film, to interrogate Wiecek and interpret the polygraph readings and Wiecek's truthfulness. Late in the film, a primitive fax machine is used to transmit a photograph to Wiecek's parole hearing.
Overall, this is a well-acted and produced film. The range of experience of the actors differs widely, but they all work well together. Even screen rookie Keeler, the polygraph inventor, is superb in his brief role.
The only plot hole is the motive behind the officer's murder at the start of the film. Skutnik sees the two masked gunmen enter the store while the officer is seated nearby, out of sight of the gunmen, yet says nothing to alert the officer and possibly thwart the robbery/murder.
Wiecek's fate? Watch the film. You won't be disappointed!",1015372800,2,2462,5.066502463054187
560173,4,6303102506,"Call Northside 777 is an under-appreciated Jimmy Stewart movie. It casts Stewart as an investigative reporter who tenaciously investigates an old murder for which an innocent man has been imprisoned. The script is very good and so is the supporting cast, including Lee J. Cobb as the newspaper editor who starts Stewart on the case. If you like Jimmy Stewart, or even if you just like good movies, see  Call Northside 777. It is an excellent example of the Golden Age of movies when there were so many good movies made that some very good ones -- like this one --  unfortunately, have been somewhat overlooked.",970617600,2,610,4.745283018867925
560174,4,6303102506,"Director Henry Hathaway, a master at semi-documentary filming (The House On 92nd Street) leads Jimmy Stewart through a maze of dead end clues in the prison drama: Call Northside 777.  Based on a true story, Hathaway's  location shooting in Chicago provides a visual  landscape etched with  gritty realism.  The opening sequences of Chicago's windblown streets are  vividly captured.  Although the film's running time of 111 minutes is a bit  too long, Hathaway succeeds in creating a story based on one man's  obsession in finding the truth.  Richard Conte plays Frank Wiecek a man  accused of murdering a police officer.  With only the incrimminating  testimony of one eyewitness, Wiecek is convicted and sentenced to a 99 year  prison term.  Eleven years after Wiecek's conviction, his mother Tillie (  Kasia Orzazewski) saves $5,000 and offers it to anyone that can prove her  son's innocence. A reporter ( Stewart) meets Tillie, a floor washer and  becomes skeptically involved in the case.  Prodded by news cheif Lee J.  Cobb, Stewart becomes determined to unravel the complexities surrounding  the case.  In typical Hathaway fashion, scenes involving a lie detector  test, photographic lab work, and the Illinois State Prison grip the viewer.  Stewart is excellent as reporter PJ McNeal.  His lines, timing, and  mannerisms flow genuinely.  Stewart's performance in Call Northside 777  reaffirms his fine acting talents.  Kasia Orzazewski's performance as  Tillie is exceptional.  I wonder how Hathaway was able to find this Polish  actress whose character was ""made"" for her.  Conte gives an even  performance, while Helen Walker as McNeal's wife is a fresh face.",963532800,2,1670,5.296153846153846

Another peerless performance by Stewart probably the most  versatile actor ever( Probably? )  Here he plays the newpaper reporter  drawn in to the drama in trying to exonerate ( Conte) Frank Weicek.

560269,5,6303102506,"One of the best dramas ever made and one of Jimmy Stewarts best performances.  Ive loved this movie ever since I was a kid, it speaks of the era when the press didn't cave so easily to political pressure and was still one of our last lines of defense against a corrupt system.  The fact that its a true story only adds to the appeal. I happen to live in Springfield Ill where some of this movie was filmed I even worked for a short time at the then Illinois state journal news paper in the circulation dept.  I do not believe the journal is anything like this now, it prints what its told and doesn't go against the Illinois machine.  That's why its so refreshing to have a look back to the days when some integrity still remained in the press and one of the reasons I sometimes prefer these old movies - sure there was corruption then too as is proven by the weichek case itself and how he was railroaded to satisfy the need to nail a cop killer no matter who they could blame it on -- but if not for the press of the day and one honest curious reporter how many more years would he have been wrongly imprisoned-?  Our justice department today should work as hard as this reporter to get to the truth.  Watch for the scenes showing a very early version of a fax machine-!
I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the noir/drama genre and to anyone younger who needs a look at how the press used to be / is supposed to be and likes to see the underdog come out on top.  RIP Mr. Jimmy Stewart -",1431216000,2,1496,4.137931034482759

560277,4,6303102506,"Although it is described as a film noir, CALL NORTHSIDE 777 lacks the required darkness of that genre: the story is straight forward, there is no bleedover between the good guys and the bad guys, and the cinematography lacks the rich and shadowy quality one expects of the noir style.  It is instead akin to a police procedural, the story of a reporter who stumbles onto a miscarriage of justice and works his butt off to get the story and make things right.

CALL NORTHSIDE 777 describes itself as ""a true story.""  Well, not really--but it is based on events in the life of Joseph Majczek, who was wrongfully convicted of murder, but the script plays pretty freely with the facts.  In the film, newspaper editor Brian Kelly (Lee J. Cobb) is intrigued by an ad he spots in his own newspaper's classified section, an ad that offers a $10,000 reward for information leading to the exposure of the true killers in a decade-old murder case, a crime for which Frank W. Wiecek (Richard Conte, playing the role based on Joseph Majczek) was convicted and sentenced to 99 years.  Kelly orders reporter P.J. McNeal (James Stewart) to find out about it.  McNeal interviews Wiecek's mother Tillie (Kasia Orzazewski), who has scrubbed floors for ten years to raise the reward money.  When his story about her proves popular with readers, McNeal expands it into a series, and gradually comes to believe that Wiecek is innocent.

The movie is extremely well made, with Stewart and Orzazewski standouts as the jaded reporter and the convict's mother, and it moves at a quiet but even pace that makes its occasional explosions seem intense by comparison.  Even so, I think it is a movie that gives up all its secrets in a single viewing; it's worth going out of your way to see once, but I can't imagine returning to it again.  The DVD includes several trailers and an effective audio commentary.  Recommended.

560290,4,6303102506,"Call Northside 777 (1948) was directed by Henry Hathaway for Twentieth Century Fox and stars Jimmy Stewart. This movie is one of those docudramas replete with narrator so prevalent in the film noir genre.

A cop is killed in a speakeasy robbery in a Polish neighborhood of Chicago in 1932 and the owner fingers two men as the perps. Both are sent up the river for 99 years. The mother of Frank Wiecek (Richard ""Barzini"" Conte), one of the convicts, scrubs floors for eleven years to raise money as a reward for information on the actual killers. A Chicago newspaper editor (Lee j. Cobb) sees her ad and assigns reporter P.J. McNeal (Stewart) to investigate. McNeal initially doubts Wiecek's story but as he digs deeper into the case he's convinced of the Pole's innocence. McNeal eventually discovers enough evidence to have Wiecek pardoned.

I first learned about this film from a lengthy article in the Polish American Studies journal (""The Real Life Story Behind Call Northside 777: The Crime, the Conviction, and the Search for Justice,"" by Leonard Kurdek, PAS, Autumn 2013, pp. 5-78). The movie was based on the real life arrest, conviction, imprisonment and release of Polish-born Chicagoan, Joe Majczek, although the script doesn't always adhere to the actual facts of the case.

This is an enjoyable movie with many entertaining aspects. Call Northside 777 was the first feature film to be shot on location in Chicago. Several scenes were filmed in the actual ""Back of the Yards"" southside Polish neighborhood including multiple tavern scenes with patrons speaking Polish. There are several shots of Holy Trinity Church looming in the background. Jimmy Stewart gives another likeable performance as the crusading journalist. Joanne De Bergh is wonderfully convincing as Wiecek's Polish wife, Helen. Polish actress, Kasia Orzazewski, played Wiecek's faithful mother. The inventor of the lie-detector, Leonarde Keeler, plays himself in a small part. Other familiar cast members include  E. G. Marshall, Thelma Ritter, and Wagon Train's John McIntire.

Joe Majczek's imprisonment created a bit of a sticky situation. After seven years in jail Joe convinced his wife they should divorce so that she and their son might have a normal life. Following the divorce she married Ed Bartosiewicz and the couple had a baby daughter. A few years after Joe's release, Helen divorced Ed and remarried Joe although she still had a soft spot for her second husband. As told years later by Joe and Helen's son, Jim:

""Ed was still a part of the family and Helen. Ed's daughter was getting bigger and Ed came around more frequently to see her. No one had asked for the way things had happened, and Joe knew Ed still loved Helen. On special occasions, Ed would take Helen out. How can you condemn this situation? Helen never figured things would get this crazy with Joe's early release from prison. This tug of war with her heart was the aftermath of a justice system that failed them miserably when they were young.""

Helen became pregnant with Ed's child although Wayne Majczek went to his death in 2009 never knowing who his real father was. In his final years, Joe Majczek was consigned to a mental institution and passed away in 1983 followed by Helen in 1993.

Fans of Call Northside 777 who wish to learn more about Joe Majczek's less-than-happy life following his release should check out the Kurdek article. There's also link to an interesting blog about Majczek and his family in the comments section below.",1382140800,4,3505,4.969283276450512

560330,3,6303102506,"Call Northside 777 has a lot going for it: Great black and white photography, a documentary style that includes authentic location shots, terrific casting and top-flight acting by Jimmy Stewart, Lee J. Cobb and Richard Conte among others. And a fine central plot concept whose bubble is completely burst by a thoroughly undramatic and tedious screenplay. Newspaper editor Cobb sics reporter Stewart on a story involving a classified ad seeking information concerning a decade-old killing. His investigation uncovers a compelling story of a mother trying to find justice for her son (Conte), unjustly convicted of the murder. Skeptical at first, Stewart eventually comes round to believing in Conte's innocence and fights for a pardon with all his energy. And that, sadly, is about all there is. One at first tends to hope that Conte is taking the fall for someone else, and that some sinister conspiracy will be unmasked. Well, there is a conspiracy of sorts, but it's more a simple matter of the police just wanting to pin the crime on someone. We get a glimpse of Stewart's marriage and begin to think that his work on the case will create some strains there that might add a bit of drama, but no, the wife is very supportive. Conte's wife has divorced him as Conte wished, so that their son could get a fresh start, and one might think that that could create some personal tension, but no, all along and to the end Conte, his now ex-wife, their son, and the wife's new husband, played by a meek E.G. Marshall, seem quite comfortable with this little emotional menage. Then there's the man who was convicted of the murder along with Conte -- no one seems at all concerned with getting him free, despite the fact that he is just as innocent. Then there's a strange reversal by Conte, who at one point tells Stewart to stop writing his stories and then inexplicably begins to cooperate again. Though atmospheric and well-acted, this film eventually sinks in tediousness, which is never relieved. It deserves 2.5 stars, but I'm bumping it up half a point because of its good qualities.",1358726400,3,2084,4.807799442896936

560333,4,6303102506,"Er, Call GRO-1758. CALL NORTHSIDE 777 adapts the true-to-life account of a cop-killing convict who was released from prison after two newspaper reporters unearthed evidence that exonerated him. ""1932 was open season on cops,"" remarks someone in the movie. In 1932, the height of the bootlegging empire, eight policemen were gunned down. In November of 1933, Frank Wiecek (Richard Conte) was sentenced to ninety-nine years in prison for killing the eighth cop.

Eleven years later, in 1944, reporter P.J. McNeal (James Stewart) of the Chicago Times writes a human interest piece on an old Polish scrub woman who had placed a personal ad in the paper - ""Call Northside 777"" - offering $5000 to anyone who would step forward with evidence to support her incarcerated son's innocence. (In real life, the phone number was GRO-1758.) McNeal's story proves to be so popular that the city editor (Lee J. Cobb) assigns McNeal to a series of human interest pieces featuring the scrub woman's son Frank Wiecek. The skeptical McNeal initially resents the assignment but the deeper he digs, the more he comes to believe that Wiecek really is innocent.

Nothing like a brutal global war to distort one's wide-eyed worldview. All of a sudden, the movie audience preferred ""real"" pictures. In the late 1940s, a series of films shot in gritty, semi-documentary fashion was released, films like THE HOUSE ON 92ND STREET (1945), THE NAKED CITY (1948), 13 RUE MADELEINE (1947), and PANIC IN THE STREETS (1950). CALL NORTHSIDE 777 falls smack dab in the middle of this era, having debuted in 1948. Jimmy Stewart at this stage was pretty tired of playing those boyish, idealistic characters; he craved more believable parts. His hard-nosed newshound role would predate his collaborations in the 1950s with Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Mann. To accentuate the underdog theme and to escalate the drama, the film flips the scenario and opts to present Stewart's reporter as a solo act instead of working in tandem with another reporter. It works out fine. James Stewart is once again reliably very good.

Other than in the credits, no background score mars the sense of docu-realism. Director Henry Hathaway not only seamlessly marries authentic Chicago landmarks with convincing Hollywood sets, he accurately depicts the life and culture of an immigrant community in a major metropolis. And, as with actual documentaries, CALL NORTHSIDE 777 trots out a professional demonstrating his field expertise and accessing all the resources available to him. This was a time in which modern technology was only just making its mark. Maybe the juiciest bit of trivia in this film concerns the sequence in which Frank Wiecek undergoes the lie detector test. Time is spent in explaining the process and the administering of the polygraph, which, by the way, was co-invented some two decades ago by Leonarde Keeler. The juicy bit is that, in the scene, Leonarde Keeler himself does the explaining and administers the polygraph test.

Never mind that the deciding piece of evidence is pretty weak, that's about the only flimsy thing in this film. I hesitate to refer to CALL NORTHSIDE 777 as a full-on noir crime drama. There are absent qualifying elements. It isn't seedy enough. There's no alluring femme fatale. There isn't that streak of moral ambiguity to plant the lead character at a crossroads. But this is just quibbling. CALL NORTHSIDE 777 is a really good movie that lauds the American press and takes a poke at police corruption and political grandstanding. James Stewart's confident performance carries the narrative. And maybe the most fascinating thing is that it's based on something that really happened. As the reporter triumphantly escorts the exonerated man from the penitentiary, he tells him: ""Aw, look, Frank, it's a big thing when a sovereign state admits a mistake. But remember this: there aren't many governments in the world that would do it."" Bro, he's not lying.",1347235200,,3954,5.097222222222222

No guy wronged by some wicked femme fatale or some wrong gee getting his just desserts for being a blight on the community leaves me decidedly chilled.

Worst is a story where the right gee wronged is championed by the fourth estate (ya, the press for the clueless) in order to see that some rough justice (and an increased circulation) is done in that aforementioned wicked old world. And then to have mild-mannered, intrepid, if off-handedly seen-it-all (at first anyway), Jimmy Stewart come out of left field to save the day, save the gee, save motherhood, save apple pies and save the American way of life, well, like I say give me a wrong gee or a wicked femme to chew on anything.

560347,5,6303102506,"Call me square.  My wife and I found this 1948 film more than entertaining.  It was moving and uplifting.  ""Why don't they make films like this any more?"" she asked.

Jimmy Stewart gives a fine performance as ""O'Neal,"" a newspaper reporter asked to investigate the case of a man who may have been wrongfully convicted of murder.  So does Richard Conte as the imprisoned ""Wiecek.""  To read about the real case that inspired the film, begin with the Wikipedia article on ""Majczek and Marcinkiewicz."")

To this viewer, though, it is Kasia Orsazewski's portrayal of Wiecek's mother, sacrificing everything to obtain her son's release, that most tugs the heart.  In one scene that no doubt deeply struck moviegoers of 1948, she hears from Jimmy Stewart that his newspaper must end its support for a new trial for her son.  Her sobs -- ""you are my last friend"" -- really tug the heart, as does the quelling of her tears when she looks at a homely statue of Mary.  ""Big fool me.  Sure I got a friend.""

Aside from the plot and the mystery, the film has two other agreeable features.  One is its glimpse at 1940s technology -- typewriters, linotype, printing presses, the polygraph, and photo transmission.  Finding the evidence that frees ""Wiecek"" ultimately turns on this technology.  It seems so old-fashioned and quaint now, but no doubt audiences in 1948 were amazed by the modern marvels.

The second is the film's view of Chicago's ethnic neighborhoods.  Director Henry Hathaway filmed many scenes on location, and these actual scenes of a poorer and rougher ethnic Chicago fascinate.

When you watch this film, tune into your own reaction.  The film's tone is earnest and sentimental with a strong patriotic undertone, a confidence that justice will be done.  My guess is that in 1947, watching the film's final scene outside the prison walls, women and men both teared up.  If that's your reaction too, the ideals of this movie live on.  If, however, you have a different reaction -- say, ""who can believe it turned out this way?"", or ""wasn't it a hoot seeing all those old machines,"" or ""right, good always wins over evil, ha, ha,"" or ""well, they freed one, but how many other innocent men were ignored by the system?"" -- you have a more 21st century sensibility.

560348,3,6303102506,"""Call Northside 777"" is a straight crime drama from 1948. Jimmy Stewart plays a savvy newspaper reporter who stumbles onto the story of a convicted cop-killer who may be innocent.

The film starts out with about 10 minutes of dead-pan exposition - Dragnet style - that virtually brings the movie to a halt before it starts. They were probably going for the sound of the Dragnet radio show, but they didn't succeed very well at capturing it. The exposition doesn't even save any time in moving the story forward. It brings nothing that couldn't have been handled better in dialog by the very characters on screen as the exposition is tiresomely revealed.

Stewart's role is played pretty seriously. It gives him little chance even to smile, and very few shots at the wry Jimmy Stewart humor that makes his films so charming. We watched this movie strictly because Stewart was in it. For that reason it wasn't a waste of time. It was a Jimmy Stewart movie that had somehow escaped us before. But unlike many Stewart films, this will be one that we won't feel the need to watch again.

The plot was pretty standard investigative crime fare for the time. It's about on a par with any of a dozen crime shows you can watch every week currently.

Lee J. Cobb adds some spice as Stewart's editor, but the rest of the acting performances are nothing special. Richard Conte as the wrongfully convicted man is pretty wooden. He fixes a look of hurt concern on his face and reuses it in scene after scene.

560379,5,6303102506,"This drama is based on a true story from 1932 Chicago. Scenes were filmed at the actual Chicago sites for this story about the conviction of an innocent man. A newspaper reporter investigated an old case and his reports led to freedom for Frank Wiecek. [Was this the event that led to ""The Court of Last Resort""?] Chicago's newspapers recorded its history. A local grocery store kept a speakeasy in the back room. Two men entered for robbery and then shot a policeman who had stopped in from the cold. Information led police to Frank Wiecek and his wife Helen. Ex-convict Wiecek admitted to letting a friend stay over. Both Wiecek and Tomek Zaleski were identified by Wanda the store owner as the guilty pair.

In 1944 Tillie Wiecek put an ad in the newspaper offering $5,000 in reward for solving the murder of Officer John W. Bundy. Would this huge sum of money cause someone to turn in the guilty party? Reporter James P. McNeal interviewed the mother and wrote a human interest story on this scrubwoman. Would an identification from a single eyewitness be enough to convict? Yes. [Professor Borchard wrote a book on how eyewitness misidentification led to the ""Conviction of the Innocent"".] The defense lawyer was a drunk. Frank was ""taken around the horn"" to prevent his lawyer from filing a writ of habeas corpus to free him. [This was before the reforms of the Warren Court.] This story was very popular with the readers of the `Chicago Times'. Frank's divorced wife proclaimed his innocence. McNeal comes across as a cynical newspaper reporter; are they still like this?

McNeal returns to state prison to talk to Zaleski. The trouble with being innocent is that you can't make a deal by turning in some guilty party! They show how a ""lie detector"" works; Leonard Keeler appears as himself [the inventor of the polygraph]. Wiecek passed the lie detector test, but this has no legal merit [and never will]. McNeal uses a Minox camera to copy old police records. Why would anyone question the reputation of the Chicago police? McNeal continues to research the history of this case, and gets a break in finding the suppressed records. His Minox camera records the pages. These stories result in official complaints to the newspaper publisher. We learn a little about the law. If a witness won't change her testimony then the alternative is to discredit her as a liar.

McNeal's research leads to Wanda's new address. There is an actual location with worn-down stair treads. McNeal's stories tried to get a reaction from Wanda so they could locate her. This is the end of the story. A newspaper tells of a forgery in another case. This leads to the discovery of an overlooked detail in an old picture. McNeal talks to the parole board and tells about what this picture may show. A facsimile machine transmits the enlargement to the parole board, it identifies the date on the newspaper photograph. Will this contradict Wanda's testimony and lead to the release of Frank Wiecek?

560380,4,6303102506,"Like others I want to agree that this is a highly interesting and entertaining film.  As a resident of Chicago I find it especially interesting since it was the first major film shot largely on location in Chicago.  It contains a host of shots of various areas of Chicago.  I found it fascinating to compare various familiar areas that I know well today with the way they looked at the time of filming this in the late forties.  It is yet another great Jimmy Stewart performance and should be seen by anyone who is a fan either of him or of forties crime film.

I do, however, take exception of this film being described as film noir.  This term denotes a specific film genre, one developed in the early forties by a number of directors and cinematographers and characterized by a number of narrative conventions.  I find it astonishing that anyone would refer to this as film noir.  Although it is in black and white and focuses on a crime, it has absolutely nothing in common with any of the definitive film noir classics.  For instance, the protagonist is not an anti-hero and there is no moral ambiguity int he film.  There is no devious female akin to Barbara Stanwyck in DOUBLE INDEMNITY.  CALL NORTHSIDE 777 is absolutely not film noir.  It does not look back to film noir products like THIS GUN FOR HIRE, THE MALTESE FALCON, DOUBLE INDEMNITY, and THE MAN ON THE THIRD FLOOR, but to pseudo-documentary works such as THE HOUSE ON 92ND STREET.  I don't want to sound like a puritan, but words and terms can't mean just anything.  A huge number of films made in the forties shot in black and white and dealing with crime stories are not thereby film noir.  It takes a great deal in addition.

Also, it has been mentioned a few times here that the inventor of the lie detector, Leonard Keeler, was seen administering the test.  Well, yes, that was Leonard Keeler, and he played an important role in improving the lie detector, but he built upon the work of a large number of previous researchers and can hardly be considered the key figure.  The truth is that a string of late 19th century and early 20th century figures worked on the development of the lie detector.  In the United States the two most important early figures were probably Hugo Munsterberg and his student William Moulton Marston (the latter later invented the cartoon character Wonder Woman, a feat for which he received far less contested credit).  Marston in particular did a great deal to popularize and publicize the lie detector.  A number of other researchers worked on improving Marston's machine, culminating in the work of John Larson.  Leonard Keeler's contribution was in improving Larson's machine and extending his research.

This quibbling aside, this is a fine film which should be seen for a number of reasons, even if it isn't film noir.  It contains some fascinating location footage not only in Chicago but in the prison in Statesboro, Illinois.  This was one of the first films made in Hollywood (other than Westerns) shot on location and not on a backlot.  But the best reason to watch it is that it tells a compelling story and features fine acting not merely by Jimmy Stewart but by a number of excellent actors.",1195603200,3,3207,4.661921708185053

Jimmy Stewart stars as P.J. McNeal, a Chicago newspaper reporter who investigates Tillie Wiecek's (Kasia Orzazewski) personal ad, which offers a $5,000 reward for information regarding a police murder, which occurred eleven years earlier that she believes wrongly convicted her son Frank (Richard Conte). McNeal is clearly conflicted after meeting this poor, older woman since she is sacrificing all that she's earned the past eleven years in hoping to free her son. McNeal ends up writing an article about his story and it's received with overwhelming interest.  McNeal's editor, Brian Kelly (Lee J. Cobb), believes this is a story that will keep selling newspapers so he tells McNeal to pursue this story further.  McNeal visits Frank Wiecek in jail and finds out a lot more about Frank - a lot of it is good and some of it is initially bothersome.  All of this sets up the remainder of the film where McNeal becomes in essence a private investigator, looking for clues that will break this case for Frank Wiecek.

There are a lot of things that I liked about this movie.  First, it doesn't try to hide from the fact that the newspaper's motives for investigating this crime are as much financial (selling newspapers) as moral (finding out who really killed a policeman).  Furthermore, because the reporter intentionally omits some damaging details in the earlier articles about Frank Wiecek, it exposes the reality of media bias.  The film also reveals a dark side of the Chicago police, which has historically had a reputation for corruption.  The outcome of the movie is of course predictable, but how it gets there is what makes this movie a winner.  The movie also features a lot of fascinating scenes set in the ethnic neighborhoods of Chicago.  Of course Jimmy Stewart does a great job, which is no surprise from this Hollywood legend.  About the only noteworthy negative criticism of the movie is that Richard Conte doesn't sell his role very well as being ethnically Polish compared to all the other Polish characters in the film.  He just sounded like he normally does - an Italian-American guy from Brooklyn.

The DVD quality is very mixed.  It starts out impressively with pristine picture quality but it seemed like a lot of the scenes with Jimmy Stewart for some reason showed tiny specs of film deterioration.  The sound is good and the bonuses include a trailer, a short clip about the movie's premier and commentary by James Ursini and Alain Silver.

560402,3,6303102506,"Before Fox Film rereleased this old noir, I had never heard of it, which is surprising considering Jimmy Stewart is my favorite actor.

This movie, along with 5 others recently ressurrected by Fox for their noir series, is number 02 in the series. Having seen Laura previously and being thouroughly impressed with the digital restoration on the film, I have to say this film was a small step down in that department. Also, the special features included on this disc weren't as imaginative as in the previous release, including only the trailer's for a few films in the Noir series and an extreamly short news reel from the time about the premiere of the movie.

The movie itself, is amazing as a classic noir, as well as a platform for the acting talents of the whole cast, in particular, Jim Stewart and Lee J. Cobb.

Stewart plays a newspaper reporter asked by his boss, played by Cobb, to investigate a blurb in a rival paper by the mother of a man in jail for a sentence of 99 years for killing a police officer, offering a $5,000 reward to anyone who finds the real killer of the officer, claiming her son innocent. At first, Stewart is skeptical about the innocence of a convicted cop-killer, but as he falls further and further into the events surrounding the day in question, he changes his mind and dives whole-heartedly into a quest to find the truth and the real killer.

Stewart brings a whole star to the overall rating of the film, playing the reporter in such a convincing portrayal that the film becomes almost documentary feeling. This is also very helpful to the film considering the film and the character Stewart is playing are based on real events and people.

While not as stylish or elegent as Laura, the film's grittier look and feel actually end up working to its advantage.

Definitly worth its $7-10!!

There's lots of good review material above, but what happened to Wanda, the supposed key witness? Did the other prisoner get released? Maybe this is in the commentary track. I skipped to the final scence after seeing the entire movie, and listened for some additional info about the final release. None was heard. 777 seems to have some additional symbolism that may have been overlooked. Wiecek was one very lucky (three 7's) fellow to be freed. I believe in the trailer there's a suggestion the story was featured in Time and Reader's Digest magazine. Maybe in 1948. Perhaps more of the story can be found there. Too bad they didn't use these sources to tell more of the story in the sparse extras.",1123459200,,792,4.624113475177305
560404,5,6303102506,"A poor woman, Tillie Wiecek (Kasia Orzazewski), runs a newspaper ad offering $5000 for the capture and conviction of the men who killed a Chicago policeman over a decade ago (`Call Northside 777.)  Her son Frank (Richard Conte) was tried, convicted and sentenced to 99 years for the murder, but she's convinced of his innocence.  City Editor Brian Kelly (Lee J. Cobb) reads the article and assigns beat reporter P.J. McNeal (James Stewart) to investigate the story.  There are angles to be played.

 And played they are.  They liked to rip `em from the headlines back then, too. CALL NORTHSIDE 777 (1948) is an old school docu-drama, one of a number to emerge in the immediate post-war era.  Armed with lighter cameras and faster film stocks, steeled with a passion for location and a love of verisimilitude, these movies boldly left the dressed set for the dirty street.  In this case it's the Polish ghettos and the grimy prisons of broad-shouldered Chicago that are surveyed.  Stewart, in one of his first non-boy ingenue roles, is given a chance to play a skeptic, an ambitious assignment reporter with a deep well of cynicism and an eye for the angle.  Films like CALL NORTHSIDE 777 not only open with a title card telling us ""This is a true story,"" they emphasize that all important point by assuring us that `real locations were used whenever possible.'  The movie opens with an extended montage of Chicago from the Great Fire (I think that one, at least, must have come from a reenactment in another movie) to the Prohibition era, replete with Chicago's finest smashing casks of bootleg hooch and brief newsreel footage of such real-life notorati as John Dillinger and Al Capone.  All this preface material blends seemingly seamlessly into the movie proper.

 Stewart was always a relaxed and easy-going actor.  The understated, naturalistic approach this movie takes suits him well.  In fact, the highlights of the film are the scenes he shares with Kasia Orzazewski, who seemed to have little more to offer than naive sincerity.  Understatement is the key word here, though, and Orzazewski's lack of actress-y affectations adds, rather than detracts, from things.  Lee J. Cobb and Richard Conte come off well, too.  I should mention poor Helen Walker, who plays Stewart wife and gets maybe ten minutes of screen time.  She's more or less a sounding board, a film contrivance who's there only to give Stewart someone to share his humanizing doubts with.  As James Ursini and Alain Silver point out on the commentary track - a pretty good one, although Ursini has an annoying habit of dropping his voice to a hard-to-hear whisper at the end of sentences - the Production Code forced the McNeals to sleep in separate twin beds.  What they don't mention, at least I didn't hear it, was the rather anti-Code expos of police corruption the movie investigates.

 Also, as Ursini points out, this movie loves technology.  Photo transmitting gizmos, miniature cameras, and sophisticated telephone relay stations are all lingered over.  Most glaringly there is a really, really long polygraph session scene that features the non-actor inventor of polygraph technology Leonarde Keeler.  It probably came across as cutting edge back then, but it reads `quaint' today.  In fact, it's yet another `new' technology that director Henry Hathaway spends a good thirty minutes building up to that provides the vital piece in the movie's resolution.  I won't give it away, but the `evidence', the one that the movie is so proud of, is totally bogus!  If I was one of the half-dozen or so attorneys crowding into the frame during that nearly final scene I'd have been sputtering outrage.  Still, it didn't quite wreck things for me.  In fact, I loved CALL NORTHSIDE 777 as much for its flaws as I did for its strengths.  It's not perfect or even all that convincing, but it gets a strong recommendation nonetheless.",1122940800,34,3904,4.920489296636085
560425,4,6303102506,"It's a documentary-style movie of what I believe is a true story (at least that's what the movie tells me). It came out in 1948 and stars James Stewart as a journalist for the Chicago Daily Times. His boss Lee J. Cobb finds an ad in the paper of a $5000 reward for anyone who has information on the real murderers of police cheif Bundy back in prohibition days. The ad was posted by the mother of one of the men who has been found guilty of the murder and has a 99 year sentence. Intrigued by the news-worthiness of the story, Cobb sends Stewart to find the mother and write an article about her. He does this and the public response is overwhelming. So Stewart has to continue the story even though he doesn't think he believes the story. Over time, though, after interviewing the man in prison, Frank Wiecek, and doing some more analysis he is positive that Wiecek is not guilty. In order to prove that Frank should not be in prison he has to track down the original prosecution's star witness, Wanda Sputnik, the owner of the speak easy where Bundy was shot. It takes a long time, but he ends up finding her and their confrontation is the best scene in the movie.

The movie has no soundtrack and it seems like it must be a true story because it merely hints at a scandal whereas a made-up Hollywood movie would undoubtedly paint a much louder and scandalous picture. That is it's biggest fault in a way: that it lacks some real excitement and instead is just very truthful to the real story.

A similiar movie to this is Hitchcock's The Wrong Man, but whereas this movie centers more around the work of journalist James Stewart, The Wrong Man stars the wrong man. This is an interesting movie about what could go wrong in our justice system, but it lacks a certain ingredient to make it great.",1122681600,,1797,4.409638554216867
560426,5,6303102506,"""Call Northside 777"" is based on the true story of Joseph Machek and Theodore Marcinkovitz, who were wrongly convicted of the Prohibition-era murder of a police officer, and the ""Chicago Times"" newspapermen, reporter James P. McGuire and copywriter Jack McPhail, whose investigative reporting exposed the miscarriage of justice. The film was made in the documentary style that gained popularity in the late 1940s, with sparse, omniscient voiceover narration, non-professional actors in small roles, and even occasional documentary footage. It was filmed on location in Chicago and in the Illinois State Penitentiary. Names have been changed, and the ""Chicago Times"" journalists have been merged into one composite character. ""Call Northside 777"" is sometimes called documentary-noir or newspaper-noir, but it doesn't possess the cynicism or corrosive noir environment of the hard-hitting ""T-Men"", which was also based on a true story. ""T-Men"" is more noir, while ""Call Northside 777"" is more neo-realist. But this is top-notch docudrama and late-40s-style ""social conscious"" filmmaking that honors crusaders against injustice.

In the Polish district of Chicago, December 1932, a police officer is shot to death by two masked gunmen in the storefront of a speakeasy owned by  Wanda Skutnik (Betty Garde). Police suspect a patron of the establishment named Tomek Zaleska (George Tyre). They arrest his friends, Helen and Frank Wiecek, at whose home he spent the night of the crime. Frank (Richard Conte) and Tomek protest their innocence, but both are convicted of the crime on the testimony of Wanda Skutnik and sentenced to 99 years behind bars. In 1944, eleven years after the conviction, Frank's mother, Tillie Wiecek (Kasia Orzazewski), advertises a reward of $5,000 for the identity of the real killers. ""Chicago Times"" city editor Brian Kelly (Lee J. Cobb) asks his reporter Jim McNeal (Jimmy Stewart) to investigate the unusual advertisement and pushes a skeptical McNeal to pursue the story of Frank's case and possible innocence.

""Call Northside 777"" -which is the telephone number in Tillie Wiecek's ad, by the way- was Jimmy Stewart's first hardened or cynical role, as he began to get away from the boy-next-door charm of his earlier roles. Jim McNeal is a blunt, distrustful man, who is out for his own interests. He isn't always a nice guy, and he isn't sympathetic at first. Jimmy Stewart could play obsessive and intractable as well as anyone. And he could create a sense of downhome, common sense righteousness better than anyone. Much of ""Call Northside 777""'s success rests on his ability to do both here. At 1 hour and 51 minutes, this was a long movie for its time, but it moves along at a nice clip. There is a bit of technophilia that is so often present in post-war films, as we anxiously await photostats that have been sent over a wire service. Photostats have rarely been so fascinating. ""Call Northside 777"" is terrific docudrama whose story, style, and performances hold up very well.

The DVD (20th Century Fox 2005): ""Fox Movietone News"" is a one-minute newsreel of the film's 1949 premiere. There are theatrical trailers for this film (2 minutes) and 4 other films. The audio commentary by film noir theorists and authors James Ursini and Alain Silver is very worthwhile. They provide scene-by-scene commentary on visual and narrative style, characters, actors, discuss the roots of the documentary style, and compare the film to the real case on which it is based. Subtitles available for the film in English and Spanish. Dubbing is available in French.",1121731200,8,3587,5.189982728842833
560427,3,6303102506,"The documentary style employed here may have been revolutionary for it's time but to me it undermined the urgency of the story being told.  What this film needed was a little flair in relating the story of an ace reporter(James Stewart) who is trying to free a man (Richard Conte) of a cop-killing conviction.  The location scenery is nice and the black-and-white cinematography works effectively, too, but maybe this film needed a little editing to punch up the story.  Stewart is adequate here and nothing more.  The best performance delivered here is probably by Conte in the few scenes he is given.  A major annoyance here is the use of voice-over narration that pops up at intervals with little rhyme or reason.",1121385600,4,716,4.836065573770492
560428,5,6303102506,"Made in 1948, CALL NORTHISDE 777 was one of the movies that began a trend of true-to-life, naturalistic Hollywood films; its clearest successor was 1956's THE WRONG MAN.  CALL NORTHSIDE 777 was based on the case of Frank Wiecek, a young Polish-American man wrongly convicted of murdering a police officer during the Prohibition era and ultimately exonerated thanks to a determined reporter named P.J. McNeal.  In the roles of McNeal, Wiecek, and Brian Kelly, McNeal's sympathetic boss, director Henry Hathaway cast three talented, big-name actors:  James Stewart, Richard Conte, and Lee J. Cobb.  Stewart is quite convincing in his tough-guy role - in which he also shows flashes of the MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON-type idealist - while Cobb is atypically quiet-spoken and restrained.  It is, however, Conte's intense but gentle convict who steals the show.  One genuinely sympathizes with this unjustly accused man who has languished for eleven years in jail and even allowed his wife to divorce him and remarry rather than disgrace his son with his name.  One suffers with him as he undergoes a lie detector test and rejoices when he is finally pardoned and freed.  Yet the viewer is never allowed to become too emotionally involved in the story, due to the movie's semi-documentary style, which is generally content to present ""just the facts"" in economically written scenes.  CALL NORTHSIDE 777 is a great example of the ultra-realistic type of movie.  For more of the type, check out THE WRONG MAN, directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Henry Fonda.",1120867200,,1559,5.102362204724409
560429,5,6303102506,"Movie: *****  DVD Transfer: ****  Extras: *****

The end of World War II ushered in what is often called a ""new realism"" in the genre of crime films.  Many scriptwriters started to turn away from the realm of fiction as a source of material, and began to concentrate more heavily on stories culled from real life.  At the same time, production moved out of the studio backlots and into actual locations where the events being recreated had taken place.  Under the aegis of Darryl F. Zanuck, 20th Century-Fox became the industry leader at this new kind of semi-documentary, producing such popular and critical hits as ""Boomerang!"" (1947, filmed in Stamford, Connecticut) and ""The Iron Curtain"" (1948, filmed in Canada).  One of Fox's finest efforts of this entire period was ""Call Northside 777"" (1948), based on a true story which took place in Chicago, the city in which much of the movie was filmed.

""Call Northside 777"" details a newspaper reporter's re-investigation of a murder case which had been tried more than a decade previously, and which had resulted in the conviction and life sentencing of two men, both of whom maintained their innocence.  James Stewart plays the newsman who began to cynically exploit the saga for its commercial appeal, only to become convinced that one of the men was indeed innocent, and then doggedy worked to exonerate him.  The role is a juicy one which heavily dominates the film's 111-minute running time, and Stewart underplays it beautifully, offering one of the best performances of his distinguished career.  His achievement is complemented by the work of an amazing supporting cast, several of them relatively unfamiliar to audiences of the time, and all of whom perform with an unsentimental earnestness that works to the picture's benefit.  These performances were unquestionably enhanced by Henry Hathaway's surefooted and tight direction, and by Joe MacDonald's masterfully moody location cinematography.

The DVD presentation of this film falls just a smidgeon short of perfection.  During one scene, while the DVD shifts between layers, the picture freezes for a second or two, which jars the viewer and slightly disrupts the pacing of the film.  Otherwise, picture and sound quality are exemplary.  Extras include Movietone News footage of the film's premiere; the Theatrical Re-release Trailer for this film plus the Original Trailers for ""Laura"", ""Panic in the Streets"", ""House of Bamboo"", and ""The Street With No Name""; and an audio commentary track by James Ursini and Alain Silver.  On the whole, ""Call Northside 777"" is a beautifully packaged DVD, one that is recommended as a worthy addition to your home video library.",1117843200,5,2680,5.15242494226328
560430,3,6303102506,"""Call Northside 777"" is a sincere, though somewhat overly earnest attempt at docudrama-neo realist style. Part of the problem, at least for contemporary audiences, is 777's over-reliance on stock character types (the saintly mother, the intrepid reporter, the gruff city editor, etc) of which there seems to be no shortage of here. Such dusty artifice, coupled with a predictable man-wrongly-accused plot, quickly undermines all compelling sense of realism. If anything, the film seems stiff, a precursor to the terse, straightjacket style of TV's Dragnet. Hitchcock gave a more lucid (and more moving) exploration to this sort of material with his aptly titled ""The Wrong Man,"" which captures the neo-realist style with greater ease and tenderness.

777 is strictly film buff stuff, nontheless, it's black and whites cinematography looks smashing in this DVD's crisp presentation. Definitely worth a look if film noir history is your bag.",1111622400,8,939,5.475862068965517
560431,3,6303102506,"I don't consider this noir, it's a free-an-innocent-man neo-realist procedural more in the vein of Naked City or, even, Dragnet.  Jimmy Stewart takes low-key to new lows, his wife appears briefly and supportingly, Lee J. Cobb underplays and remains a cipher, there's no mystery here about how it will end and the journey isn't especially interesting or entertaining.

As others have noted, it does provide a glimpse of the Polish immigrant community in Chicago after WWII and a look inside an amazing prison.  What caught my ear were the 2 or 3 times where the script intentionally indicates that Chicago has the finest police force in the world, anything that happened happened in the old days, we're so over that, etc.",1111449600,6,720,4.933884297520661
560432,4,6303102506,"Once in a while the writer gets to be the hero. In Henry Hathaway's classic film noir thriller Chicago Times editor Brian Kelly (Lee J. Cobb) sends investigative reporter P. J. McNeal (Jimmy Stewart) to investigates a 1933 murder when he comes across a classified ad offering a reward for info on the case. Although skeptical at first about the innocence of convicted cop killer Frank Wiecek (Richard Conte), all the mysterious dead ends McNeal encounters convinces him that the might be something to the story.  Never garnering the critical acclaim or following of other directors, Henry Hathaway (""True Grit"", ""Nevada Smith"", ""Kiss of Death"") created a series of worthwhile thrillers, westerns and action films. Sadly much of Hathaway's work has been overlooked because he was viewed as little more than a workman-like film director. Although Hathaway doesn't fit into the French auteur theory that made stars of film directors like Orson Welles, John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock and Michael Powell, his films always feature strong performances, well written and intelligent scripts. ""Calling Northside 777"" ranks as a strong film noir based on a true story (much like Hitchcock's well regarded thriller ""The Wrong Man"") and many of the exteriors were shot on location a rarity at the time. This unusual film straddles the line between docudrama, Italian neorealism and film noir much like Anthony Mann's minor classic film ""T-Men"" (1947). The crisp, intelligent script by Jay Dratler (""Laura"") and Jerome Cady (""Wing and a Prayer"" sadly Cady died shortly after the film premiered) rings true with dialogue that doesn't sound dated despite the passage of nearly 60 years.

A sharp, crisp looking transfer highlights ""Calling Northside 777"" making it another outstanding release in Fox's Film Noir Series of vintage classics. The cinematography of Joseph MacDonald with its rich use of shadows and unusual lighting schemes looks exceptionally rich with solid blacks. The mono sound doesn't suffer from hiss or any of the usual problems from a film made in the late 40's. Fox has expanded the sound a bit using an artificial stereo mix that sounds quite good.

 Fox has generously provided a ""Fox Movietone News"" for the film's premiere. Although it runs a little less than a minute this vintage peak into Hollywood's past is much appreciated. It would have been nice to have one of the A&E Biography segments on the actors involved in the production whether it be about Stewart or Lee J. Cobb. We also get the original theatrical trailer which is a blast to have and compare to the overblown theatrical trailers we have today. Finally we get film trailers for other Fox Film Noir Classic titles ""House of Bamboo"", ""Laura"", ""Panic in the Streets"" and ""The Street with No Name"".

Featuring a trivia filled commentary track by film historians and authors James Ursini and Alain Silver, we learn quite a bit about the real case that inspired the film and also quite a bit about the shortcuts the producers took to dramatize the story. What's most fascinating is to note how Jimmy Stewart's performance here changes compared to the two previous films he made; ""Magic Town"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" weren't big hits and they were also the last two films where Stewart played on his boyish persona. Here Stewart plays a much more hard bitten cynical character with compassion at the core of his character. This persona would be put to excellent use in the films that Stewart made for Anthony Mann, Hitchcock and other directors. ""Calling Northside 777"" was really the first major change that Stewart made to his screen persona in some time. As the authors point out what motivated Stewart to make the change were these film failure but also the fact that Stewart was about to turn 40. This mid-life/mid-career crisis shifted Stewart into some of his most rewarding film roles of his career.

 A terrific and overlooked movie, ""Call Northside 777"" finally gets its due on this DVD. Although the extras could be a bit more generous with biographies of the main actors/production staff, the commentary track makes up for this short fall with trivia about the production of the film and the year it was made. The sharp image quality of the DVD and solid mastering make this an essential purchase for noir fans.",1110153600,81,4298,4.977715877437326
560433,2,6303102506,"Realistic, documentary-style recreations are one thing, but call Northside 777 falls off the mantle.
Sorry, guys, I give thumbs down on this one. This film is directorially unimaginative, the dialogue is lousy and lacks spontaneity, and a stone cold soundtrack almost totally devoid of music make Call Northside 777 a film I would rather have missed.
I am a serious fan of Lee J. Cobb and James Stewart, so I really can't fault the casting at all. The actors are appropriately cast in their roles; they make a great pair. But the director kind of plods along, the first half of the film so cumbersome, so utterly predictable. The emotional impact ""hits"" seem especially ill timed.
Henry Hathaway fails to plant any questions in the audience. In short, Call Northside is not a ""whodunit"", but rather a ""Who- didn't-dunit""

Maybe the film editor blew it. But more than anything else, it's the lack of a score, a lack of passion, a lack of flow; cold, analytical, sluggish. Maybe this film could have been great if Alfred Newman had been cut loose to do something creative. But this time out, the composer seems to be in a straightjacket, and I doubt it was his choice. Someone taped up Newman, I swear it.
What this film needs more than anything else is a score. A score to richly stir the emotions: paranoia, loathing, suspicion, determination, insinuation. Instead, we have only the persistent crackling of the optical sound.
The best thing about this motion picture may be the locations, especially the rounded penitentiary location, which is stunning.
