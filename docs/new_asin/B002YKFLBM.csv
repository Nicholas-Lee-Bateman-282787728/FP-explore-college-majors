4013270,5,B002YKFLBM,"An interesting and moving story, enjoyable for both children (over 8) and adults.  A great film for families to watch together around Christmas.",1264809600,5,144,5.260869565217392
4013271,5,B002YKFLBM,"I read the Greg Kincaid novel last year, about this time.  It was the first book I bought and read on my Amazon Kindle.  I loved it.  I loved it so much I found myself rather speechless trying to come up with a review. When I saw that Hallmark had made the book into a movie, there was no way I was going miss it!  I worried that the story might not ""translate"" to film, but it did, and very effectively.  The characters are beautifully drawn, and well acted.  Everyone was exactly as I'd pictured them to be when I read the book.  This is not only a Christmas story, but a story for any time of the year.  It's not just a ""dog story"", but viewed as such it's satisfying, without being overworked, or overly sentimental. It's a very human, life affirming tale...and there were many instances of damp eyes while watching it. This is something I can highly recommend (both the movie and the book) without any hesitation.  Remember those animals waiting for a good home in the shelters everywhere. Perhaps there's someone there waiting for you.  The life you save may be your own.  I can't afford the DVD now, but perhaps the price will come down eventually.  I very much want to add this to my DVD collection.",1260230400,8,1207,4.387387387387387
4013272,5,B002YKFLBM,"Hallmark continues its fine tradition of delivering outstanding quality movies.  This one is no exception.  After seeing the advertisement trailers on TV, my family anxiously awaited its showing.  The wait was justified.  Don't think there was a dry eye in the house in some parts of the movie and we weren't subjected to what appears as fast becoming the norm for the majority of movies made these days i.e., foul language, the ""F"" word being about every other word spoken, over the top amount of T&A and/or sexually oriented scenes being consistently shown.  (I'm no prude but do wonder if morality en total isn't, unfortunately, becoming a thing of the past).  What this movies does provide is both realistic and believable family situations as well as animal/human interaction, superb acting and another bit of proof that animals are in fact human's best friends in that they give so much love, comfort, companionship and loyalty and ask for so little in return.  How anyone can abuse any animal is beyond my comprehension. Hallmark, whose life long motto has always been ""When you care enough to send the very best"" demonstrated their caring by stepping up to the plate and publicly endorsing support of and encouragement in adoption of pets from local shelters (rather than spending huge amounts to buy a pet who may have come from a questionable source.  One prime example is puppies that come from one of the horrible ""puppy mills"" recently showcased on several of the national news programs).  As a family who has a loving, precious yellow lab mix we got as a puppy from our local shelter, we have first hand knowledge about adopting from a shelter.  Huge kudos to Hallmark for supporting this most worthwhile program.  And while others were standing in line to buy high-priced e.g., jewelry, electronics etc., we stood in line to buy this movie the next day after it was shown.  Glad we did.  When we finally made it to the counter we got one of only three copies left.  (Our local Hallmark store is a small one but the owner indicated that he had received 50 copies).  Think the kids have watched it at least three times since we bought it.  Highly recommend this movie.",1260057600,10,2181,4.776
4013273,5,B002YKFLBM,"I'm reluctant to call this a film ONLY for those who LOVE heartwarming stories because of the fine acting by Noel Fisher, Bruce Greenwood, & Linda Emond.  It's not JUST for dog lovers either because Fisher's role & performance upstage the dog named Christmas, in my opinion.  Although it's a heartwarming Christmas story and a delightful film for dog lovers, the quality of the acting and directing merit watching this one any time of the year.

Could I find fault with the movie? Certainly. The story is fairly predictable in parts. Even if I were to list a few other shortcomings, I think those would prove trivial to such a touching production.  It's one of Hallmark's better movies.

Since I have not read Greg Kincaid's fine novel, I cannot compare it to this movie.  I'm confident that Kincaid's readers who purchase the DVD will render their judgements for viewers who want such a comparison.

This is an excellent family film.  Kids will love it.  The film lends itself to viewing as a family.",1259884800,31,1001,4.7398843930635834
4013274,5,B002YKFLBM,"One of the most moving and heartfelt movies I have ever seen and believe me with the trash thats out there today on television, it was somewhat unbelievable that this sort of story, writing , and great production values would be shown on American television today but then there it was. I could always trust ""The Hallmark Hall of Fame"" to broadcast interesting productions. I could relate to the Bruce Greenwood charcter. Everytime I would lose a dog, a big chunk of my soul would tear me apart. I had to put my 14 year old yellow lab mix down because of seizures and a stroke which left him paralyzed. I have 2 other dogs now, both strays that were starving in the woods when I found them. get this movie on DVD. You will not regret it.",1259798400,2,737,4.3478260869565215

4013276,5,B002YKFLBM,"This is one of the most well done and touching Christmas movies I have ever seen.  It's a little like ""Old Yeller"" but with a better ending.

A special treat for all animal lovers and people who want something deeper from Christmas than just Santa Claus and materialism.  Some of the best, realistic family values and the ability to overcome are portrayed in this wonderful movie.",1259539200,70,380,4.7272727272727275

4013357,4,B002YKFLBM,"A sweet little film that hits all the right notes.  A heart-warming tale of a young man with a learning disability named Todd McCray (Noel Fisher) living with his parents in the rural midwest. The story takes place over a two-week period over the Christmas holidays when the local animal shelter launches an ""Adopt a dog for Christmas"" program. Todd's unconditional love for animals enables him to embark on an endeavour to ensure that as many dogs as possible get adopted by the local community.

One dog in particular has grabbed Todd's heart and through intermittent flashbacks, viewers slowly discover the reasons for his father's reluctance to fully support Todd's efforts.

The film is a must see if you have kids or you happen to be an animal lover.  This film is on my must see list during the holidays!",1467763200,4,811,4.771428571428571

4013506,5,B002YKFLBM,"A dog named christmas from hallmark hall of fame is a great movie. It's a holiday movie that takes place in the state of kansas in the summer time. They filmed it when it was 100 degrees and over in july and august. They fluffed out the snow from rain and sleet. What's nice about this movie is you get your full money for when you buy this is worth the purchase. It's a nice movie for everybody including young children, children, kids, teens, and adults. It's suitable for all ages starting at ages 3 to 113 and older. I'll clarify my point of view to finish my sentence. People who are that age can watch the movie. It depends what people like and prefer. I prefer it as a family film for all ages. You can watch it on the hallmark movie channel or you can own it on digital video disc which means dvd. You can even get this movie on vhs. I want to go a little in depth on this movie. Before I do that the  dvd on the front cover itself is a gold crown collector's edition. Hallmark hall of fame  with the cast Bruce greenwood Linda edmond and noel fisher a wish, a gift, and a journey. A dog named christmas is based on the best-selling novel by greg Kincaid. On the dvd digital video disc dvd. Is a 1:85 wide screen film with a duration of ninety 90 minutes long. On vhs of video it is a full screen movie which is rare. On the back it includes the making of ""a dog named christmas"" conversation about the production cast & credits biographies wide screen version 5.1 Dolby surround Bruce greenwood Linda edmond and noel fisher. A dog named christmas. ""This is no place for a dog. They are just a distraction."" George McCray and it so often his friends were amazed to learn that a start had been ""invited"" to spend the holidays with george, his wife mary Ann and their son Todd on their kansas farm. When todd, a developmentally-challenged twenty 20 year old with an affinity for animals hears the animal shelter is looking for families to foster a dog for the holidays, he's eager to to sign up. But george says ""no adoptions"" -even temporary ones claiming he wants to protect Todd from disappointment. Mary Ann knows better. Something else is troubling her husband - something he doesn't want to face. With Mary Ann's support, Todd's persistence pays off. He chooses a friendly yellow lab from the shelter and names him ""christmas."" Bringing christmas home is a revelation for george. The dog seems to know immediately that this is where he belongs. Watching Todd and christmas together, george sees his son in a new light. And it soon becomes obvious that Christmas has actually ""adopted"" george, creating a bond that is stronger than past disappointments. A dog named christmas is a joyful movie that is destined to become s holiday tradition. The making of ""a dog named christmas"" author greg Kincaid will be the first to admit that when he wrote this little christmas story for his children, he never could have imagined the series of events  that would follow. See how the hallmark hall of fame created a snowy kansas farm from a thriving summer landscape in Saskatchewan. I want to tell the amazon.com customers I'm not forcing them to buy anything it's their preference. They can buy whatever they need and want. About the story from my perspective point of view is that about The film Bruce greenwood told the boy no you can't adopt a dog or have a dog because the boy had a health problem in the story. He was forgetting things. The boy had a disorder he was autistic but a very smart young man. He always obeyed his father and he got what he wanted. At the beginning of the story the dog named christmas journeyed west and almost got runner over by a semi truck. The father and the son painted together and they got on the same band wagon together. But the boy liked taking care of many different animals. He was a painter they called the boy Todd. His father didn't even want him to get on the ladder.the father told the boy you can't have a dog unless you clean up your room. He has to do his chores or no dog. His room is messy so he has to behave and clean his room nice clean which is thourghly clean. He has so many animals that if he wants another animal he has to do what his father tells him. His mother even gets on the boy case but it was sad. He had to let Jake the parrot go because he fixes wounded animals then he let's them go. On the radio he heard about a contest about raising all kind of dogs so he went to pick them out. The mother was less lenient but Tha father was very strict with his son but the mother was not to hard on him. The father had his own dog when he was in the service. My favorite part of the film of the story is that christmas the dog liked to play with a ball a lot. He rolled it to the father and son.

4013538,5,B002YKFLBM,"What a delightful movie in a day where much of what is offered needs to be selected for the appropriate audience depending on age and taste.

Not so with this one! Young and old alike will no doubt enjoy this well-made work.

This movie has elements which will touch the hearts of those dealing with difficulties in life relating to reliving memories long since past, dealing with ever-present physical and mental trauma; caring for those with special needs and disabilities; enduring relationships and the sacrifice, compromise, and reward that go along with them; and also the joy and ache of families growing up and away from each other. This movie also focuses on something that is not very prevalent in today's modern, instant gratification society. Namely, that of persisting and working hard now and not seeing the reward until much later - perhaps even years later.

But the main point of the movie is driven home with the love a boy has for his dog - and the affection returned in the faithfulness of a dog for his boy. This truth is found not only in the son - the hard-working young man who is eager to please at every turn, but also in the work & battle-hardened, soft-spoken father who is reliving long-forgotten emotions brought to the surface by the introduction of this faithful dog to the family.

We first watched this movie with my kids when they were younger, and again Christmas 2013 when they came home from college for the holidays. They absolutely loved it then and still do now, and I must admit that it still brought a tear to mine and my wife's eyes again as we watched.

Get this move and feel free watching it with a wide audience during your holiday gatherings as it conveys its message of love, sacrifice, hope, healing, and joy - along with the delight found as a boy discovers the love he has for his dog!",1388188800,2,1838,4.591463414634147

4013604,5,B002YKFLBM,"For anyone who has a special needs child, or who has worked with one, knows the ""Hollywoodization"" portrayals are always unrealistic.  Not so in this movie.  Here, a father who suffers from his own issues (PTSD, Viet Nam) wants to teach his special needs son how to survive on his own, after he and his wife are no longer living, so commitments are very important to him.

The writing was realistic, and the acting...not the usual over-acting saccharin of Hallmark, but down to earth, credible performances, including subtle face expressions and non verbals.

The cast was terrific.  The father's pain, along with his joy, was never overdone, and the dog was not deified, which is often the case.  Even small details, such as the special needs boy having outdated headphones lent credibility to the story.

This was a beautiful family story that did not distort real families, with real values, struggling with real decisions, but left the audience with the warm sense of family, and the bonds that keep us together.  This was a nice heart tugging movie that did not rely on violence, nudity or vulgarity, yet the skill of the actors was enough to bring us the reality, and the story enough to hold our interest.
Kudos to the writer, as much as to the performances, especially the father and the special needs son!  ***** Stars.",1354492800,,1328,4.7894736842105265

""A Dog Named Christmas"" is the story of a boy. (Really a young man) who is learning
challenged, but not challenged in his ability to love, and to draw those he loves together.

There was so much respect for one another shown - and I was uplifted in so many ways by this
movie. I will watch it again and again.  I seldom recommend movies to others, because of
the difference in tastes, but this one is different.  It is terrific!  (Not a Santa Claus

4013613,5,B002YKFLBM,"We here at WebbWeaver, don't normally review television movies, but in the case of Hallmark Hall of Fame's A Dog Named Christmas, we are making an exception. This feel-good movie was directed by Peter Werner, with Jenny Wingfield writing the script from the New York Times Best Selling book by author Greg Kincaid. It stars Bruce Greenwood as George McCray, Linda Emond as his wife Mary Ann and Noel Fischer as their developmentally challenged, 20-year old son, Todd.
This wonderful story opens with the McCray family who own a farm in Kansas. George and Mary Ann's son, Todd has a way with animals and when he learns of a local animal shelter's 'Adopt a Dog for Christmas' program, he immediately sets out to convince his dad what a great idea it would be to foster a dog for the holidays. George and Todd visit the shelter and find a dog with no name. Todd decides that the dog's name is Christmas . But there are 32 other dogs in the shelter without homes for the holidays and Todd begins his own campaign to insure that they all get placed and loved by a family, for Christmas.
While Christmas is with the McCray's, Mary Ann tries to convince George that Todd should be allowed to keep the animal, but personal trauma in George's past causes him to resist the idea.
This film was not just a movie about a dog, but a movie about the love of a family, one person's impact on a community and the inner turmoil of a man who is trying to resolve his past. A Dog Named Christmas will make you warm inside and show you how the love of an animal can open our hearts and save us from our pasts. If you want a wonderful and heart-warming story to share with your family, believe us...this is it. WebbWeaver gives A Dog Named Christmas a 5-star rating and we highly recommend this movie for the Holidays or anytime.

It never ceases to amaze me that no matter how many different movies I watch that center around a dog in some way shape or form, each one manages to bring something new and unique to the table. There never seems to be an end to the stories to be told about these wonderful amazing animals or to the people wanting to hear them. I have an extensive library of animal dvds and this is another one that I would highly recommend that anyone that loves dogs add to their own personal collection.
