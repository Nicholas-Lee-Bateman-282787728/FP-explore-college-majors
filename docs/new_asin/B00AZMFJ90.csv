5531328,3,B00AZMFJ90,"""We're not the chocolate Kennedys."" Wade Walker (Robinson) is in love with Grace Peeples (Washington) and is getting ready to propose. Grace leaves for the weekend to visit her family without inviting Wade. After talking to his brother Wade gets up the courage to surprise her at her family's cabin. When he shows up things don't go as planned and he begins to question if this is a family he wants to be a part of. First off I have to say I'm not racist. That said if Tyler Perry's name is on a movie I tend to avoid it. Even though this is just a ""Tyler Perry Presents"" it was enough to lower my expectations. I'm not sure if it was the low expectations or not but I ended up really enjoying this and laughing the whole way through. Robinson is very funny and David Allen Grier has some really funny scenes in this. It's a good thing the comedy was there though because the movie is so generic and overdone that the laughs are the only thing that made it interesting. After 5 minutes you can pretty much tell exactly what is going to happen. Overall, a funny movie that was much, much better then I was expecting. I surprisingly give it a B+.",1377734400,,1144,4.300925925925926

If you know anything about David Alan Grier then you will enjoy
this movie.",1377734400,,133,4.153846153846154
5531330,2,B00AZMFJ90,Just for clarification---this movie was not written by Tyler Perry; he just presented the person who wrote it to allow the movie to get attention.,1371945600,15,146,4.88
5531331,3,B00AZMFJ90,"A guy visits his girlfriend's family, for the purpose of proposing marriage. He finds that he has trouble fitting in, and has a particular problem receiving the blessing of the father. The situations he finds himself in are at times funny, with the family members, who all have their idiosyncrasies, proving to be fodder for laughs. This is not the cleverest movie of the year, but it does have its moments. It is certainly not Bridesmaids, but Peeples does have some good comedy in it, maybe just enough to get a slight recommendation.",1370822400,6,536,4.774193548387097
5531332,1,B00AZMFJ90,"This movie is so BAD!
Why does Mr. Perry continue to write about sex again and again and again?
Does he think christians who are supposedly his target audience want to see this junk!  The disrespect of women in Peeples and the condoning of Lesbianism was awful. This is not something that your target audience (Christians) is suppose to be supporting.  The world is right now a modern day Sodem and Gomorrah and I do not think it is funny. Girls are being raped on college campuses and in homes and it is an epidemic!
The Movie: It was about a guy who went to his girlfriends home for a weekend to announce he is to wed Kerry Washington.  The dad did not like him and let him know. He met men she had slept with in her past and got mad.  The dad was immersed in sin or nude swimming with the mayor.  The mom was an alcoholic and a past half naked singer of raunchy songs. Kerry's sister was a dike (as she said). Kerry's brother was
troubled and stealing from his own family(mom's gold earrings) and playing with ladies underwear in his room and had a poster of a woman on his wall wearing boys short panties. Kerry's dad watched her get a spanking by her boyfriend from outside a window. Needless to say he was scarred.  A threesome was offered to a male houseguest by kerry's sister who is a lesbian. She came out over the weekend and told her dad she was gay.

This movie was awful and none of these people were leading a life anyone in their right mind would aspire to have.  It was suppose to be funny but it was downright sad. Does Mr. Perry really think sin that put Jesus up on that cross to die an agonizing death is so funny? I had given up on seeing Tyler Perry movies, but I saw that Kerry Washington was in the film and I decided to give it a try. I did not read the ratings as I always do.  I made a mistake. I will not do that again.
I think this film had so much potential to be good.  Perhaps Mr. Perry should get some little ones to help him write his scripts. Scriptures says, 'Out of the mouth of babes and nursing babies you have perfected praise?'""",1370736000,6,2070,4.165413533834586
5531333,3,B00AZMFJ90,"Wade Walker (Craig Robinson) lives with Grace Peeples (Kerry Washington). He relates to children through music and wants to be a counselor. She is a lawyer at the UN and her family is referred to as the ""chocolate Kennedys."" Wade's plans to propose to Grace are interrupted by her desire to spend the weekend with her family, who he has never met. Urged by a friend (Malcolm Barrett), Wade crashes the family get together with formulaic results.

As it turns out the family has all sorts of issues and secrets which they hide from their father, Judge Virgil Peeples (David Alan Grier). Wade spends his time having an uncomfortable weekend filled with faux paus as he tries to help. The film includes Peeple/people and cheap Moby Dick humor.

For those who like Tyler Perry type comedies, this one fits the bill, but comes off a little stale. It does have some good scenes which made me smile. The film needed to have one more episode to develop Wade's character before he meets the family, then have him either draw from his talents, or better yet, have to do just the opposite to resolve issues with her family. It attempts, but fails to do that effectively, missing the key ingredient of the formula success.

The guy decides to show up so he can go through with his proposal, but he causes one disaster after the other with very little effort.

I'm honestly glad I did.  There are parts where I actually laughed out LOUD!

Formulaic? Yes?

But, I'm actually glad to have watched a movie where you can actually share with your family (so rare these days).

For the record, there are adult themes (implied meanings, a spanking that you might have to explain to the little ones, things like that)...But, give the DVD a viewing before passing it along to the rest of your family - just in case things of that nature bother you...)

I'm actually buying this one!

This was one of the lamest piece of poop movies I've ever seen in my life. Kerry can do better than movies like this. She's established a career now she doesn't have to take the s***ty roles anymore. I've never seen a Tyler Perry movie that I've liked and this horrid movie certainly didn't change that. Don't waste your time. It super SUCKS !,1400889600,,450,4.369047619047619

Oh my goodness...it's definitely worth having in your archive.  Get out the popcorn and gather the family for a good laugh. I have no buyers regret here.

5531797,4,B00AZMFJ90,ANOTHER GOOD MOVIE TYLER. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WASNT GOING TO BE GOOD BUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE A ALRIGHT COMEDY MOVIE.,1387584000,,118,3.9583333333333335
5531831,3,B00AZMFJ90,"""Peeples"" is the latest in a succession of Tyler Perry involved flops.  I did not check the writer, but whoever wrote must be Perry himself or one of his disciples!  This film is dull, cliche, uninteresting and it even has the obligatory illuminati gay agenda in it - of course.

The male star of the film is known for his afro and he seems like a nice guy, but he is not funny!  He needs to stick to his 'other market...'  Kerry Washington was looking as cute as usual, although still showing skin - as usual.  David Alan Grier has dull stand up, but this type of comedy seemed to fit his style perfectly!  His lines were the only things funny in this film!  If he were not in it, I would have given this one star!  He was actually funny in this!  The grey hair seems to better fit him too for some reason.

If it were not for the nice looking women (the mother included), this film would not have kept my attention.  Too bad two of the women had to be gay - fitting in with the ORDER'S agenda that any player MUST obey and include or they do not get any projects released!  We really do not need to see the gay thing nor do we want to, but the powers that be want to beat us over the head with these things, so until we do something about them, we will have to deal with them.

Melvin Van ""Peeples"" makes a cameo as well as the very elderly and surgically altered looking Diane Carroll.  They were good to see and Peeples has aged better than Carroll.  Overall, this is something to watch just to say you saw it, but nothing worth buying to coming back to.  Tyler Perry needs to stop being greedy and hire writers with talent.  I know i'm funny and I need a check - so hire me!  Oh yeah, I talked about the agenda - so i'm out of the running!",1387152000,,1744,4.076470588235294

If you're bored and don't have anything to do just walk around the block because that would be better than watching this mess that doesn't deserved to be called a movie. I like the the actors but I guess they have to take whatever role that comes up to pay their bills. This was bad from start to finish. I was waiting for this to get better but from the opening scene I should have known better. Glad I didn't buy this trash because that's where it would've ended up.

5531893,4,B00AZMFJ90,"We rented it on redbox first as we do now with all movies because you just don't know what to trust these days when it comes to films, music or any entertainment for that matter...so much talentless crap out there but Peeples wasn't a disappointment! I'll admit some moments could've been funnier but the moments that were funny were really funny. The movie is about a girl(Kerry Washington,Ray/Scandal) who's boyfriend shows up to her parents Hamptons home with unannounced with intentions of asking her to marry him. Upon his arrival he's quickly and awkwardly introduced to the Peeples, a family who puts up a front of being pristine and perfect but in actuality they're dysfunctional and don't really know each other that well. The father-a prominent judge who's stiff and proper with his family but disappears each night to frolic the beach in the buff with a female neighbor, the mother- a recovering alcoholic and former disco star, the brother- a cleptomaniac who aspires to be a rockstar to shed his geek rep, the sister- a gorgeous closet lesbian, and the main character who has a secretof her own.  (The whole cast is actors/actresses that are some of the best at what they do. Not sure why so many negative reviews, seems like one person gave a bad review and everyone else jumped on the band wagon. If you're expecting Ted or Hangover type humor, it's not here because this isn't that kind of movie and Tyler Perry didn't actually write this so there's no inconsistent drama either...Thank God! Bottom line...
Peeples churned out enough laughs to pick a depressed person up on ""one of those days"" so it passed the test. I would watch it again!",1381190400,24,1656,4.770034843205575

LionsGate needs BRING BACK the choice between iTunes Digital Copy and UltraViolet Digital Stream like they did with the movie The Big Wedding. I know they can do it. Forcing us to use UltraViolet like Warner Bros. and Sony are doing is not ok. It's bad enough that certain Fox movies are like this. LionsGate REALLY needs to STOP copying Warner Bros. & Sony's tactics of forcing UltraViolet down our throats.

No Digital Copy = No sale like I have mentioned before.

It's a fun loving movie about care free love that was accidentally mixed with true love.
