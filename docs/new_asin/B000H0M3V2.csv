2625068,5,B000H0M3V2,"These shows are from the TV series and are cute, funny and entirely entertaining for children (and adults can watch too without being too bored).  Krypto is Superman's dog who was separated from him as a puppy.  His new ""boy"" on earth, Kevin is a wonderful kid who loves his new dog.",1232496000,3,283,4.423076923076923
2625069,5,B000H0M3V2,"Great to have DVD's on Krypto and where he started out as a puppy...and how he came to find Kevin.  Great stories and our 4 year old loves them.  Simple content and very innocent situations that Krypto and his pals are put in to.  Not violent or foul language, very good show.",1231632000,5,276,4.269230769230769
2625070,4,B000H0M3V2,"If you're a fan of good old-fashioned feel good cartoons and superman kitsch, then these are the DVD's for you. Albeit the series is relatively new, it still harks back to older cartoons which didn't try to take on contempory issues or excessive violence. For an adult who wants to escape from the everyday world these DVD's are great. The only short fall is the brevity of the DVD's, neither one has more than about 5 or so episodes.",1221264000,2,434,4.506329113924051
2625071,2,B000H0M3V2,I purchased 1& 2 together (krypto dvd's) # 2 dvd doesnt play. Iv'e tried it on 3 seperate players.,1214611200,,98,4.2105263157894735
2625072,3,B000H0M3V2,"The first disc was a big hit for my kids.  My kids love superheroes and love animals.  To have both in one series is SUPER!  The second disc would have been as ""super"" but it will not play on any dvd player we own without freezing.",1214352000,,231,3.9782608695652173
2625073,3,B000H0M3V2,"Kids like the cartoon and enjoyed the first DVD. Ordered the two pack for separate occasions and was bummed to find the second one was not readable in several DVD players, and it was way to late for an exchange.",1203984000,3,211,4.3
2625074,5,B000H0M3V2,"I think that these are great DVDs for a show that was kicked off the air far too soon. thrill to the first adventures of Krypto the Superdog and Streaky the Supercat.

I love the animation on the series as it is bright and clear... The voice cast was one of the best ever for the series... Krypto scripto tells of his humble begininings as well as The Streaky Story get viewers attention and make them want to see more... the only downer as that the episodes are seperated.. The second toon after the straky story finishes up on disc 2 with the closing titles...

Even with the small nitpick... It is still a great DVD... Hopefully they will come around and put both seasons on DVD... It was sad to see the show off the air... One of the best show on Cartoon Network and I hope that the WB will come around and release the rest of the series....",1202342400,,845,4.24223602484472
2625075,5,B000H0M3V2,"Krypto instantly achieved prime placement in the entertainment hierarchy for my 3 1/2 yr old twin boys, much to my pleasure. Weary of heavy-duty action and violence, even in the viewing acceptable for children this age, we all enjoy Krypto, who is kind to his friends, has all the special powers any superhero needs, is clever in his problem solving and non-violent.",1189641600,,366,4.919354838709677
2625076,5,B000H0M3V2,i bought these movies for my son who i must say absolutely loves them he gets all the adventure of superman without some of violence often seen in cartoons today plus it is action packed enough to hold even a kid with A.D.D's attetion trust me i know all and all it was a good purchase and arrived in great condition,1185321600,,316,4.19672131147541
2625077,4,B000H0M3V2,My kids are 3 and 6. These DVDs were perfect for them. They enjoyed the extra features (I have not watched them yet). If you have kids under 8 they should really enjoy these stories. I love them too.,1169251200,6,199,4.128205128205129
2625078,5,B000H0M3V2,My 5yr son loves these movies!!! But I wish they would have made more of the series. Good buy though!,1380412800,,101,4.1
2625079,5,B000H0M3V2,"I love the series, and my mother let me have the DVDs. I love them so much! Krypto was one of my faves growing up, so it brings me back to the good old days. And I am not disappointed. I even shared them at school a couple of times. They came fast, and were pretty cheap too. They were also the only ones on the site! And now the theme song is stuck in my head! Go Krypto!!!",1377475200,,374,3.7468354430379747
2625080,5,B000H0M3V2,My 6 year grandson loves these DVD's.  It just demonstrates that old favorites can remain popular through out the generations.,1374364800,,126,5.3
2625081,5,B000H0M3V2,My Grandson saw this cartoon on Boomerang and was surprised to find out Superman had a dog....I have 37 episodes on my DVR but he still wanted the DVD so he could watch as his house!!,1366329600,2,183,4.111111111111111
2625082,4,B000H0M3V2,"My son is a huge Krypto fan, and these shows are great. The only thing I wish was a little different was the fact that there is only 5 episodes per disc. I really wanted to get him the whole 2 seasons considering that there are only 2 seasons period (and it doesn't really come on TV that often)...but other than that it's a great show.",1365638400,2,336,4.106060606060606
2625083,3,B000H0M3V2,I was disappointed. I was under the impression it was the complete series not just a few of the shows,1359936000,,101,4.1
2625084,1,B000H0M3V2,"1) Do not buy, 2nd disk does not work in several DVD players (XBOX, XBOX 360, PS3, Computer, Mac nor Sony DVD)
2) not 110 mins, only 60mins per disk (at least the 1st disk), on TV each episode is 2 stories, but Warner Bros. has each episode on 1 story that is 12mins long.  This is very mis-leading.",1355184000,,299,4.067796610169491
2625085,5,B000H0M3V2,"I'm 20 and the show is one of my favorites.

  P.S, have they fixed the problem with the 2nd disk because I hope to buy it and if disk 2 doesn't work I don't see a good reason why.",1291334400,,180,3.5641025641025643
2625086,3,B000H0M3V2,"My child loves Krypto but these Dvd's didn't work in all our players for some reason, so that is an inconvenience.",1239235200,,114,4.476190476190476
2625087,5,B000H0M3V2,My nephew loves his DVDs of Krypto.  I found them to be basic and entertaining.  What a cartoon should be.,1237161600,,106,4.25
8135675,1,B000H0M3V2,"I  like  the  show  but  there  aren't  enough  episodes  in  this  pack.
Don't  let  this  thing  fool  you.
You  may  think  its  got  6  to  8  hrs,  but  its  barely  even  3  hrs.
I  purchased  this  earlier  this  year.  I  was  very  disappointed.",1502496000,,254,4.023255813953488

8135682,1,B000H0M3V2,I bought Krypto the Superdog because my grandson loved the cartoon and they no longer play it on the networks. Unfortunately my CD is damaged and it is frustrating to watch this. I did find that Amazon offers all the episodes on Prime for a cost or you can order the entire series for around $49. I may do that but I thought it was somewhat pricey.,1402963200,,348,4.208955223880597
