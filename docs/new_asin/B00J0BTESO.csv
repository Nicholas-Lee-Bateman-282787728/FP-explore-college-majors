6308214,3,B00J0BTESO,"A group of soldiers are on patrol in Afghanistan during a fiction operation known as Icarus. This story is loosely linked to operation Achilles and might be more accurately stated ""inspired"" by true events rather than based upon. We get to know the characters by their nicknames, Smudge, Stab, Ginge (ginger) and Welch. The banter between them is not the healthy kind as they concentrate on their differences. Once one in the group dies, the troops begin to question the war and their mission while their commanding officer who has the same thoughts is forced to toe the company line.

The film is about the relationships of a diverse unit who question their leadership. The war acts as a background to escalate tension. This is not your classic war film about combat and killing the enemy. It is a war drama, one where young men are placed in combat roles and don't believe the cause is worth their life.

If anything, this is more of an anti-war film, showing how someone like Bowe Bergdahl could do and say the things of which he has been accused, although the message is not heavy.

6308215,4,B00J0BTESO,"Good movie. I read a previous review and some one mentioned this movie was the British version of the ""Hurt locker"". I wouldn't take it that far but it is still a good war movie to watch",1402790400,2,186,4.054054054054054
6308216,3,B00J0BTESO,"Mutiny! I would have shot the mouthy private long ago, to maintain discipline and well being. They became ineffective as a team once the mouthy private got away with back talking a lieutenant, let alone a captain. Captain was weak showed poor leadership as did the senior sergeant. S*** rolls downhill and the senior sergeant would had been the first casualty for not enforcing well-being and discipline. Mutiny would NOT have happened in the U.S. Marine Corps--Private would have had a gunshot wound to the skull.",1402444800,2,514,4.988372093023256
6308217,1,B00J0BTESO,"One star is being generous. Only reason I watched the whole movie is to see if anything happened worth watching,  never did. Whoever wrote the high reviews for this ""movie"" must be getting royalties from it. Never do see the Taliban that they were shooting at either. It was more like they just started shooting out into the desert at nothing.",1402358400,,343,4.622950819672131
6308218,2,B00J0BTESO,"I admire the British but can not understand many of the words they speak. I found this movie boring and never did see any Taliban or other enemies bite the dust. Were they all in stealth mode? There are many more war films much better than this slow moving and unbelievable times the enemy was there but immune to the British team. Finally, would England really send out 2 range rovers with a 50 cal machine gun and a few small arms into a very hostile fire zone? I think not! This film should be reworked and include much more action than fireside chats.",1401321600,4,555,4.346153846153846
6308219,1,B00J0BTESO,"Just a bunch of cockney accents that are impossible to understand, we quit after five minutes.  Save ur money for something better",1401148800,,130,4.909090909090909
6308220,1,B00J0BTESO,Very poor movie. It was difficult to understand due to the British accents. It was also very boring. It had five stars but only two reviews. probably from the actors.,1400889600,,166,4.566666666666666
6308221,3,B00J0BTESO,"If you think your going to get the (HURT LOCKER),(BLACKHALK DOWN),or (LONE SURVIVOR) you are not..!
This film moves at a most boring pace with more drama than action.
The plot is non exsistant and it looks like a bunch of poorly equipped actors wondering around rehearsing poor dialouge.
If you like American war movies ,....this film will waist your time...",1400803200,2,358,4.885245901639344
6308222,5,B00J0BTESO,This film has been called the British version of The Hurt Locker and it does not disappoint.  Highly recommend if you are looking for a serious movie about war and the impact it takes on the lives of those who must sacrifice themselves for their countries.,1400457600,3,256,4.565217391304348
6308223,5,B00J0BTESO,"What a wonderfully refreshing, original, exciting film! I couldn't recommend it highly enough. I am not generally a war movie fan, but this was engaging, emotionally intelligent, well paced and beautifully shot and intelligently written.",1399507200,3,237,5.8
6308224,5,B00J0BTESO,It was refreshing to see a UK unit unlike the usual uber-macho American soldiers you see in there types of movies.,1427414400,,114,4.476190476190476

6308229,3,B00J0BTESO,"When you read the promo for this video you expect lots of shooting & action.  There is some shooting at unseen assailants & one of the Brits is shot but mostly it's about patrolling in a desolate landscape against an unseen enemy among people you don't understand nor understand you.  It's obviously a British anti-war movie about Afghanistan.  But whether you support the war or not you get a sense of the futility of fighting in an arena where your opponent owns the territory.  You arrive, he leaves.  You leave, he returns.  America had a legitimate reason for being in Afghanistan after 9/11 but was sidetracked by Iraqi.  We arrived, they left.  We leave, they'll return.",1404864000,2,677,4.775862068965517

Please pray for our soldiers including our female soldiers, especially the ones who are being abused as documented in Lioness.",1404518400,,267,4.804347826086956
