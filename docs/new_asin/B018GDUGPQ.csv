7548319,5,B018GDUGPQ,"As seen in the season 3 finale, the Triceratons successfully destroy the Earth with The Heart of Darkness (the Black Hole Generator), and the Shredder's boundless and selfish lust for revenge certainly didn't help. Every human on the planet was eradicated, the Turtle's allies were defeated, and Master Splinter is ...gone. But, thanks to the help of Professor Zayton Honeycutt (a.k.a. The Fugitoid), the Turtles, April O'Neil and Casey Jones are teleported back in time 6 months prior to the Earth's destruction and travel throughout the galaxy to retrieve the 3 fragments of the generator and destroy them once and for all! And along the way, they encounter new enemies, such as the disgustingly sinister, Lord Dregg, the magical, yet totally wacky, Wyrm, the Jaws of outer space, Armaggon, and the entire Triceraton Empire! But they also encounter some new allies such as Sal Commander & Mona Lisa, the ancient Aeons, the Daagon, the Utrom Council and even their 1980s counterparts! The Turtles have one last chance to save the planet and us all from destruction, will they succeed? Let us hope so...",1458432000,12,1103,5.032786885245901
