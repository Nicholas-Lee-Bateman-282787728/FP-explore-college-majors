7858803,5,630396902X,"I was really pleased with the abs of steel 4. I still love the first abs of steel,but this one was really different. It is 40 minutes of non stop ab work. Leisa Hart goes through a standing warm up and stretch then down to the floor for the abs. This workout targets nothing but the abs. So for you people who want a pure ab workout,this is it. This tape is good for beginner and advance levels. Leisa Hart adds a bonus 5 minute extra ab sequence using a chair for  the ultra advanced people out there who want even more of a challenge. There is a cool-down at the end of the workout that relaxes and a stretch. Leisa Hart adds a another bonus after the workout an extra relaxation part that is about 5 minutes,It really makes you feel good. I think this tape should get even more than 5 stars,I think it is wonderful. I have been looking for something like this for a long time. Leisa Hart cues well and is very easy to understand. So for you people out there who are looking for a 40 minute video of straight hardcore ab work,this is it. Give It A Try",1152835200,3,1053,4.136585365853659
