8485206,5,B005SJ0N00,"Best skate movie of all time, period. This video captured the moment skating went to a whole new level.  The moves were ahead of their time and still amazing to watch today. The H-Street crew was just badass and this was their prime. The soundtrack rocks. For me it's sentimental, but if you weren't lucky enought to be skating (or even born yet) in 1990 and you ride today, do yourself a favor and watch Hokus Pokus. You won't be sorry.",1352332800,,437,4.395061728395062
8485207,5,B005SJ0N00,Anybody that started skateboarding in the late 80's will remember this awesome classic skate video. It featured some of the best skateboarding of the day and pretty classic soundtrack. Still gets me amped to hit the streets! 5 out of 5!!,1340150400,,237,4.804878048780488
