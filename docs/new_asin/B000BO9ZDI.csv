8090068,4,B000BO9ZDI,This product was used in my laptop and worked perfect. Christmas and newyears entertainment was so much fun. If you haven't tried karaoke this is the way to start having fun.,1360281600,,174,4.645161290322581
8090069,4,B000BO9ZDI,"Very good. Like how the songs are separated by style. Only complaint is that you can't select to ""play all"" if you just want to listen to them as background music.",1358208000,,163,4.290322580645161
8090070,1,B000BO9ZDI,I liked the idea that the words were on the screen and we could follow along but one of the songs was showing words for Jingle bells but playing different back ground music.  I was disappointed in the quality of the music.  Wished I had not bought it.  Would not buy again from this manufacturer.,1357603200,,296,4.345454545454546
8090071,5,B000BO9ZDI,"We love playing this CD on our Karaoke machine, especially when our family and friends are over for the holidays.",1349395200,,113,4.7
8090072,3,B000BO9ZDI,Lots of songs but they seem to be all in the same key (this creates a problem when every song is in a key that is too low to sing confortably).  They should have recorded in the key the songs were originally written in.,1303689600,,219,3.977272727272727
8090073,5,B000BO9ZDI,"This is a Karaoke Christmas collection for all ages.  It has versions of Christmas songs that are for Kids, and has Pop and Classic styles for your preference.",1295136000,,159,4.678571428571429
8090074,4,B000BO9ZDI,"We loved this set of music.  I did not, however, notice that it was a DVD not CD for the karaoke machine.  No worries! We used it on the big screen.  It was great.",1294876800,2,163,3.735294117647059
8090075,4,B000BO9ZDI,"This CD's did not work on my karaoke machine...but they did great on the Television screen.
An easy sing along for groups or parties.",1293408000,3,133,4.583333333333333
8090076,1,B000BO9ZDI,"This does not work in a Karoke player unless your plays DVDs.  I don't know what format my machine uses, all I know is it's a karoke machine and in theory, should play all karoke CDs.

That said, if you like to watch karoke on your DVD player, it's a nice collection.
I on the other hand feel like I got ripped off, as I did not see it say clearly anywhere that it will only work in a DVD player.",1292025600,5,396,3.876543209876543
8090077,4,B000BO9ZDI,"This is a great Christmas DVD for sing-a-longs. My family had so much fun singing all the songs together. The words are on the screen and are very easy to see. It has the best selection of songs of any DVD on the market. The nice thing is you can choose to have the DVD sing along with you, or turn off the singer and just have the music. We liked having the singer singing so we could follow in tune better. The singing is of good quality. You should get this DVD for your family Christmas fun.",1265587200,28,495,4.061224489795919
