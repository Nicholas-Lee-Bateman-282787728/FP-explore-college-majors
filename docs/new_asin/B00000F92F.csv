It's one of those you put excitedly into your DVD player and then go ""Oh No - there goes ten bucks"" The only hope for us is that someone has written a review. Hence this one. It's the only way we can save ourselves.",1363824000,2,257,3.9615384615384617

The gold discovered at Sutter's Mill in 1848 California brought a horde in 1849, the greatest mass mania in the history of America. The search for gold made more paupers than millionaires. The story begins with a lone rider on empty land. The Pony Express rider hands off his bag to the next rider. [Historically anachronistic.] Thousands of people fled to California. Two men arrive from Missouri to find the camp. One man there sells a machine that finds gold. Gold is plentiful, food is scarce and costly. Tracy Powell talks to Sam Wilkins. Is that wise? Wilkins gets rich by robbing hard-working miners (claim jumping). A placer box is the high-technology of that era. Sunday is for rest, or drinking. Will Tracy be cheated of his full share? Does he have what it takes?

Tray returns to see Julie, and tells about his life in California. Can Tracy find a big strike this time? Willis Haver has connections all over town. Tracy need money to develop his find. The bank wants it all! Can Tracy change to a sod buster? Tracy broadcasts seeds for planting. But he still dreams of gold. One man tells of a find, he wants Tracy for a partner. Tracy follows McCann into the hills to search for gold. Wilkins turns up, he broke up with Haver. Their hard work locates pay dirt. But a cave-in hurts McCann. Wilkins celebrates his riches in a bar. Tracy learns Julie doesn't want to see him, but goes anyway. Young Billy gets a new rifle from his father. Then bad news arrives: the vein came up short! They've got nothing. Tracy becomes enraged! Things go bad for him in Haver's bank. He is thrown out.

Julie tells him he should live and struggle like a ""normal human being"". ""Come home!"" Tracy returns to the hills to look for gold. In the cold of winter his mule dies. Tracy returns to town. Things have changed over the years. Tracy decides to stay for a while in town.

This is a story that preaches of the futility of trying to get rich for the average man. Let the rich control the economy, and accept it. How different from the pre-war Westerns when the small ranchers would unite against the greed of the large ranchers and their crooked officials. But there are no crooked officials working for large corporations today, right?",1278374400,,2259,4.57037037037037
