8073264,4,B000A2XD3O,"I wanted this set because I was interested in seeing ""One Body Too Many"".  It's a lesser effort for all involved, but was a nice way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon wasting time.  Since it came with 2 other movies, I watched them as well.  ""Corpse Vanishes"" isn't much of a script but was also fun if you are feeling undemanding. Both of these movies are fairly decent prints.  White Zombie is, from what I have read, the star attraction of this set.  The print for it is ,by far,  the most scratched and damaged of the three but it's a fairly good movie; one of Bela's better ones for the low budget studios.  This triple feature set was very inexpensive,  which made it more attractive to me as well.  All in all, this isn't going to be a star attraction in most people's video libraries, but they are amusing and a fun way to kill a few hours.",1314489600,,847,4.24375
8073265,4,B000A2XD3O,"Lost a star for the quality of the DVD.  Vintage Home Entertainment 2005 and these three movies are, of course, black and white - not color.  However, all three are completely watchable, audio good - has chapter stops, no special features.  ""White Zombie"" - check out Madge Bellamy! Her huge eyes and small painted mouth make her one of the very best zombies in classic films!  ""The Corspe Vanishes"" and ""One Body Too Many"" are a fun romp into horror with comic relief.  All are wonderful films and a welcome addition to my classic library.",1208476800,3,540,4.6421052631578945
8073266,3,B000A2XD3O,"This 3 movie set on 1 disc has one classic of note THE WHITE ZOMBIE. Unfortunately, the quality is lousy. This movie was privately produced and directed (it was not made by even a B studio) and the transfer is appalling. The movie is watchable and gives the viewer the same creepy aura of MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE and his famous DRACULA. The remaining movies are far from classics. THE CORPSE VANISHES fares better (again poor transfer)and revolves around a mad scientist (unfortunately this star was typecast as either a bloodsucker or the above) who tries to maintain his shrewish wife's youth with the blood of women who never make it to the altar (one can assume they are virgins due to the production code at the time). Each unfortunate bride to be is given a rare but toxic orchid sent by Lugosi. A nosy reporter (and the comic relief) gets involved then this flick really gets interesting. ONE TOO MANY BODIES is an carries on ""The Old Dark House"" premise to silly extremes and stars the young ""Tin Man"", Jack Haley. Lugosi is completely wasted as a servant in this plotless meandering film. Lugosi unfortunately after he became a big star in DRACULA made himself as visible as possible on the screen and was not too picky with the roles he played and resorted to working for some of the skid row movie companies and cranked out many terrible movies. Before his death in 1956, he was not working and a drug addict. He worked briefly for the notorious ""Ed Wood"" and upon his death did not even have the funds for a funeral. Frank Sinatra paid for his burial. A sad commentary for a true horror icon prone to waste his talent on worthless projects. This set is a good example. If you want quality Bela, get Univeral's BELA LUGOSI COLLECTION. He is second billed in all of them and plays with film rival Karloff. Despite the rumors, they did not really know each other and the only rivalry they had was when vying for the same role.

If you can't locate a better print of THE WHITE ZOMBIE, then this collection is worth it for this one film alone--flaws and all.",1190678400,,2067,4.512
8073267,5,B000A2XD3O,"A good trilogy of horror, but the prime cut on this disc is definitely ""White Zombie""!  This was the classic flick which introduced the ""zombie"" to the cinema.  The transfer to DVD is crisp and clean, both video and audio, unlike the earlier VHS offerings.  Those were washed out, fuzzy grainy offerings, this stuff is pristene.  Of note... in the single issue ""White Zombie"" from the Roan Group there's an optional commentary track narrated by Gary Don Rhodes, a Lugosi scholar, who does a great job on giving all the background on this great flick.",1167782400,2,550,4.757894736842105
