Additionally,  if you're a Carrie Fisher buff, it features a young Carrie Fisher in her  underwear in a freezer. ;) How could Leonard Maltin, who loves almost  everything, give this film a bad review? He gushes over every lame Robin  Williams dramedy they churn out.",946684800,22,464,4.423529411764706

301041,5,6300271668,"I read on IMDB that both Chevy Chase and Carrie Fisher think this is one of if not the worst movies ever made.  I could not disagree more, this is a well made film.  I seen this at the drive in as a kid late in the summer of 1981, it was funny as hell then, I'm 40 years old now, it's still funny as hell and now I get all the jokes.  its got mystery, its got comedy and its got an Axis of Evil of bad guys.  Chevy Chase is cool as Agent Thorpe and has lots of funny scenes and nice chemistry with Carrie Fisher as Annie Clarke.  its got a very well known cast of actors with Adam Arkin, Billy Barty, Mako, Eve Arden and Richard Donner(Exidor from ""Mork & Mindy"") just to name a few.  I'd call this a classic comedy, its got a good story with lots of jokes and quite a bit of physical comedy.

Silly me, I thought the digital download would not be so bad.  Wrong!
There is a semi-transparent band that goes down the right side and across the bottom of the screen that is really annoying when the shot has a light background. In darker scenes it's not so noticeable. The scene image continues behind this ghostly band. Not sure if this is because the TV is widescreen or/and 55"". Just disappointing quality.
The movie itself is just as silly and slapstick entertaining as ever.  For most of it you can ignore the band - like you would a letterbox.
Perhaps some day the more simple entertainment movies of the 80's will be restored or enhanced and properly produced on Blu-ray, DVD, or whatever the next evolution of video playback comes on the market. I hope so.",1397779200,4,956,4.488505747126437

301144,4,6300271668,"This is a flawed, silly little movie, but one I liked a lot.

The plot: a whole lot of small people descend on a hotel where they'll be staying for the filming of ""The Wizard of Oz,"" (recreated in one little crummy set, but there are costumes). Carrie Fisher is the production assistant charged with overseeing them.

More than that, Chevy Chase is a G-Man protecting a royal of some kind from an assassin, and a German small person is there to meet with a Japanese man to give him a map which will mean trouble for the U.S.

So actually, it's got a pretty decent story, it's not just an excuse to have a bunch of little people (what is the PC term for that? I'm sorry) running around a hotel.

Every kind of comedy is up there on the screen -- slapstick, ethnic, physical, puns, visual, dark -- there's a craft to it that way that I admire.

Chevy Chase is almost always fun to watch, and here I just wish he had more to do. There's a romantic subplot between him and Fisher, but it's not very well developed -- but the filmmakers did find a way to show her just in her underwear!

So, yeah, it has flaws, of course, but it did keep me entertained the whole time, which is the best a move of any kind can do. I recommend it, especially for fans of any of the lead actors, old Hollywood, or silly comedies in general.

Oh, I should mention something about the quality of the DVD -- it looked good to my untrained eye. The color scheme is dark and brown, which isn't very fun to look at, and actually a lot of the movie looks soft -- but that seems to be more of an issue with the way it was shot rather than the quality of the DVD.",1321315200,2,1631,4.110062893081761

It is full of wonderfully politically incorrect humor involving Germans, Japanese, little people, animals, etc.  Sight gags are edgy but brilliant.  The lines are precious and come fast.  The cast is brilliant, and includes such period stars as Chevy Chase, Carrie Fisher, and Adam Arkin, along with the ever-popular Ann Souhern and a host of enduring charactor actors.  The cast works hard to make the story move along.  There is a lot of spy thriller, Wizard of Oz, and just plain slapsick in the well-crafted story.  Unfortunately, the movie got bad reviews (Where was the reviewers' sense of humor?), and never got traction at the box office.  We have enjoyed it over the years on video tape, and shared it with many friends.

Unfortunately, it's getting hard to find good VCRs to play our video copy any more, so we hunted for a DVD edition, and got this one, put out in the Warner Archive series.

301212,4,6300271668,"I saw this movie many years ago and wanted to buy it, but for years it wasn't available on DVD.  I had heard that it was deemed politically incorrect, perhaps  because of the dwarfs but whatever the reason, I've been hoping it would become available.  Maybe I have a warped sense of humor, but I think it is hilarious.  The movie is full of funny scenes, but one of my favorites is Eve Arden playing a woman with poor vision and too vain to wear her glasses.  Her dog would meet an untimely death and her husband would simply buy another dog and she wouldn't know the difference.  You can read reviews of the movie everywhere, so I won't dwell on that.

During my search for a DVD of the movie in the past, I found some that were bootlegged or copied from VHS tapes, etc. that would be of questionable quality.  I'm pleased to say that this one is good quality and brand new.  As for the title of this review, if you've seen the movie you'll know what it means.",1268438400,4,961,4.236263736263736
301213,4,6300271668,"""Under the Rainbow"" was literally trashed by the critics and virtually ignored by the masses on initial release in 1981.  Time being the great equalizer my verdict in 2010 is not too shabby.  I think the sin of ""Under the Rainbow"" is that it tackled an aspect of a timelessly classic film that has a strong sense of nostalgia for a lot of people.  This film will not get you misty for ""The Wizard of Oz"" but it works on it's own terms.  It's loopy, it's chaotic, it's fun.  It's a terrific way to while away 100 minutes.  Director Steve Rash helmed the masterful ""The Buddy Holly Story"" and doesn't scale those heights here but it shouldn't be held against this flick.",1267920000,,668,4.434426229508197
301214,1,6300271668,"...either the master itself or the manufacturing process for this particular archive product is defective. There is a problem with poor compression and edge ringing that absolutely ruins this DVD-R release. Don't believe the small sample flash video of the film over at the Archive site. It hides the problem of what seems to be an ""old, smeary analog master"", to quote one Home Theater Forum participant that confirmed that this is a mass problem with this disc, not just my personal bad luck. I actually remember this one when it was running in theaters and it deserves better treatment than this. It's a strange little tale of a hotel across the street from MGM in 1939 that is trying to cash in on the publicity of the making of The Wizard of Oz and all of the strange goings on that surround it. Some of it is completely inane, but it is largely a fun film. Until Warner's fixes the problems with this one, avoid at all costs.",1259884800,47,931,4.514792899408284

301216,5,6300271668,"I love this movie! Like others have said, just shut off your brain and you'll enjoy it. This is probably one of my favorite Chevy Chase movies. I mean, seriously, with little people, Japanese tourists, and European royalty and set in the 1930's, how can you go wrong??? It's flat out fun. I agree....they need to re-release this movie on DVD.",1256169600,,342,4.622950819672131
301217,5,6300271668,"Well if you like little people and I tend to stay away from the words ""dwarf"" or ""migit"" because to me that's cruel.  But, if you love or like little people this movie is for you.  Rollo Sweet an aspiring dreamer that wants to go to Hollywood and be famous expect a telegram from the film company.  While everyone in the boarding house was listening to the President of The United States giving a speech and by the way this took place around the 1930's so you'll see old timy cars in it, so there was no television invented yet so they had to listen to the President on the radio.  When the aerial fell down, Rollo went out to fix it and when he lost his balance or got diverted, he fell to the ground in a dream.  And in the dream everyone that was in his reality, is in the dream.  You'll see cameos of Mako the late Japenese actor who looks for a German little person played by late actor Billy Barty.  Pat McCormick who works in the Hotel Rainbow.  Adam Arkin son of Alan Arkin, dwarf actress Zelda Rubinstein who we knew better as Tagina Barron in the POLTERGEIST MOVIES, Patty Maloney who we saw numerous times when Sid, Marty Kroft was around in their days.  The late Eve Arden who play Ms. McGee in BOTH Grease movies.  The main characters of course are Chevy Chase and Star Wars actress Carrie Fisher.  In the whole storyline, Rollo finds a group of little people heading to check into a hotel to start shooting for the movie The Wizard Of Oz and when they check into the Hotel Rainbow, that's when everything goes crazy.  The little people destroy the entire lobby, dining area and they even ruin the elevator.  Thorp (Chevy Chase) who is a secret service agent protecting the Duke and Duchess from an assassin while a Japenese and German agent are meeting up to trade a map with defenses against the US...Keep track of how many dogs are in this...the Duke and Duchess lose many of them...and they name the dog ""Struedel"" and each one dies of an accident.  At the end, Rollo recovers from his dream, until he sees a real car show up with little people in it heading to Hollywood.  Again, if you love or like little people this one is the movie to see.....I just wish Warner Brother's would put it out as a RErelease on DVD cause it is one classic that should NEVER be forgotten.",1180396800,3,2288,4.350588235294118
301218,5,6300271668,"Obviously from the other reviews this is a movie that you'll either love or hate, but I know more who loved it and only two who didn't. I also saw this movie on HBO in the 80s when I was about 12 and I watched it every chance that I could. A few years later I bought it on VHS and I'm sad to see that it's not available on DVD.

My friends and I would have a few drinks (while not necessary to enjoy this movie but enhance it) and rewind the best parts while laughing hysterically. How can you not laugh at Strudel fetching the ball over the balcony while the sound of the squeaky ball fades away? Or the drunken midget rolling down the stairs, shaking it off, and realizing ""I forgot my beer?"" as he stumbles back up the stairs to get it? Even today certain movie lines slip out of my mouth or I do the secret knock.

I saw this movie about five years ago, enjoyed it, and taped it.  I saw it again last night with my wife and found myself starting to laugh at the beginning of the most humorous scenes, in anticipation.

It is unfortunate that this movie is not available in DVD format.",1103760000,19,554,4.435643564356436

There's a subplot involving the assasination of a European king who's is protected by a US G-Man, Chevy Chase, who is flirting with the still cute and sexy Carrie Fisher.

Under the Rainbow is the kind of film I love. I don't want to be moved, I don't want to think, and I don't want to solve the world's problems. I only want to know that the ""pearl is in the river"". It was produced when a movie showing midgets and taller people as a farce was not considered anti-social. It is a scream! And for those of you worrying about what your children will see and hear (comparing it to today's films), it is clean!
The gags are obvious, Chevy Chase is obvious, and once it starts, it is a roller coaster you can yell and scream on and still feel comfortable.
I hear it asked, ""why can't THEY make more movies like this?"" Just open your eyes folks; Hollywood has been making great funny movies for years (Noises Off, Mouse Hunt, The Seven Chairs ...... etc.). They all don't have to be Disney pablum.

This goofy little comedy played a lot on HBO and I remember forcing my family to sit down and watch only to realize that ""funny to me"" wasn't always ""funny to them"".  Before writing this review I watched it again and had the pleasure of being reassured that I'll never outgrow the wacky movies I grew up with.  If you have YELLOWBEARD, CABIN BOY, JOHNNY DANGEROUSLY or the like on your video shelf then grab this pre-National Lampoon's Vacation Chevy Chase flick (this was when Chase was still funny) and I think you might like it.
Good trivia:  The actor who played the bumbling assassin played similar bumbling characters in 2 other silly movies.  Catalina Caper (available here as Mystery Science Theater 3000: Catalina Caper) and Hysterical (now on DVD!) starring the Hudson Brothers (""You're doomed!!"").

Which brings up a moral quandary:  If a movie provides employment for lots and lots of midget actors, but the script itself is defamatory to midgets everywhere, is it serving a valuable purpose or a destructive one?
