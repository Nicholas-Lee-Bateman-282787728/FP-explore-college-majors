The newspaper headline says ""Rackets Must Go"". A businessman discusses how to take a cut from the beef brought into town. He has a way to blame the strong-arm stuff on the striking cowboys, and then form a ""protection association"" to stop the trouble they started. A biplane lands on a meadow, a water tank for cattle is destroyed. More criminal mischief, and killings, occur. The strikers are blamed. ""James Smith"" registers at a hotel. Miss Butler is approached and offered a deal to join. She leaves and sees a man shooting at another! But its only a movie. ""Smith"" is on the lam because of a divorce action, and wants to go on a hunting trip. Elsewhere a truck pulls down a cattle fence. A woman orders them to go away. Jeff Carson shows up shows up to rescue this woman from the strangers (part of the protection racket). Later they are brought in as suspicious characters, then are hired as replacement cowboys.

We see their life on the ranch. Mr. Courtney has an attitude. Kramer signs up another rancher for protection. Courtney talks to Buck for his own good. [Subtle comedy on social standing.] That biplane flies low to scatter Miss Butler's herd of Herefords. Buck notes the trouble started after Kramer showed up. Courtney finds a movie prop and drives back in his Rolls-Royce to call the sheriff about a reward. Miss Joyce warns Buck, and offers him a place to hide. The sheriff tells them that Buck is Jeffrey Carson, a picture actor. Miss Joyce doesn't like this truth. Kramer sends that biplane to scatter the Butler herd again. A monoplane with Buck in it forces the biplane down, and the pilot talks to save his neck. The monoplane drops some grenades on the gang's hideout. The gang is captured. ""Suit yourself."" There is a happy ending.

This drama is a western movie with comedy. Buck and his friends saved the small ranchers from a protection racket run by big-city gangsters who seek new territory. This story is more complicated than the average western. The background to this movie tells about the isolation of ranchers who had no electricity, radio, or newspapers to report on local events. The use of airplanes was a high-tech attraction. You may never read about in school textbooks, but there was a Great Cowboy Strike around the Canadian River circa 1877 during the depression of that era.
