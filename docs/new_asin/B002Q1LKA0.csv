It's fast and covers a lot of ground in 98 minutes.

However, it's unfair to compare it to Burns' work. On its own merit this video attempts to cover a subject that is wide in scope and has many branches, making it a daunting task to be fit into 98 minutes. However, I think the producers and film makers came close to the mark given the constraints of time and complexity.

The pace is quick. Even some of the narration seems like it's done by a fast-talking used car salesman. On the other hand, the flow is aided by a script that sticks to chronology and relevant facts, and is devoid of any social commentary or other distractions that impede the narrative.

On the plus side, you will come away with a sense of how jazz began and evolved. However, those are only the 'whats'. The 'whys' are not covered, so if you are new to the subject or have a genuine desire to learn more, you may come away frustrated.

The pacing may be a negative, especially for folks who have short attention spans. I bring this up because on one hand this video would make an ideal teaching aid in a music appreciation class, but on the other hand, the pace demands disciplined concentration.

Overall, this is a solid, agenda-free introduction to jazz. If this particular film piques your interest, I strongly recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jazz-A-Film-By-Ken-Burns/dp/B000BITUEI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jazz : A Film By Ken Burns</a>.

8377447,5,B002Q1LKA0,"Starting with the history of New Orleans and its role in the development of Jazz, this Masters of American Music DVD highlights the most influential individuals in jazz. It includes well selected performance clips for many of the featured artists. However, the documentary has - to me - a few distractions. For example, no disrespect to the narrator, but his monotone delivery nearly put me to sleep. Also, the pace of the film is sometimes uneven. The history of New Orleans and its impact on Jazz seemed to be rushed. On the other hand, I understand the significance of Louis Armstrong, but after a while it was like, ""Ok, I get it. Move on!"" The documentary felt longer than 90 minutes; there are clips, interviews, and narration that could have been cut. With this said (and I realize those observations may seem picky),the documentary provides succinct and sufficient information that explains each artist's contributions. There are great interviews with Jazz players who were there when things were happening, and the performance clips show the featured artists in peak form. Before tackling Ken Burns' series, this documentary will serve as a good primer!",1319241600,4,1162,5.057291666666667
