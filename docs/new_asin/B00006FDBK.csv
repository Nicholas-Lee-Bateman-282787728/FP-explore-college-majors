1745481,1,B00006FDBK,The left-leaning makers of this absurd movie were clearly going for the low-info audience.  There isn't much to see here except dumb facial expressions and a few gastro-intestinal jokes.  I suffered through this one so you don't have to.,1494374400,3,237,5.051282051282051
1745482,1,B00006FDBK,"The opening scene was offensively bad. The shots, the acting and the script seemed like something a film student would make. I thought maybe that was done on purpose to be ironic but the next scene opens with a bird burping like a man. This isn't funny bad its just bad.",1494201600,5,270,4.313725490196078
1745483,4,B00006FDBK,"It's just silly zombie fun!  There is nothing in this film that is intended to be taken seriously.  It is a lighthearted, fun filled romp through zombie park central.  The version I watched had floating emoticons covering the nudity, which actually made it even sillier. From start to finish, the characters go from one bad joke to another, clich after clich, punch line after punch line.  If you like silly, goofy, slapstick comedy, you'll enjoy this film.  As one reviewer said, the more you watch it, the funnier it seems to get because you start paying attention to things going on in the background.  So true!",1493856000,5,614,4.745283018867925
1745484,5,B00006FDBK,"I first saw this movie about 10 years ago and have since seen it again a few times. I have to say that it's one of those movies that gets better each time you see it. There's so much going on behind your focus that keeps it fresh. If you take it for what it is you'll love it. It's silly and bizarre and just weird, but a lot of fun.",1492819200,3,333,3.704225352112676
1745485,2,B00006FDBK,"Hot Wax Zombies on Wheels
 This is about as close to Zombie Porn as you can get without an X rating.  The mainstay of the film is to show topless actresses every few minutes to distract the audience from the more or less random action that the script calls for.  The Zombies look and act pretty much like regular still living people.  We only know that they are Zombies because they say things like We are already dead, we are Zombies.  Join us.  They aren't very scary.
 The story line is that a group of Zombies on motorcycles arrive in a small coastal California town and set up.a health and beauty salon devoted to hair removal.  It seems that the bad guys have taken possession of an old formula, from the Spanish American War-the movie attempts comedy-which when added to wax penetrates the skin.  The resulting Hot Wax Zombies are free of body hair and have raging libidos.  They are dead but seem to be enjoying themselves.  The plot wonders around aimlessly until the baddies are vanquished by the saw dust of the California yew tree.  Tedious.
 The acting by heroine Jill Miller and villain Gwen Somers is of the lowest professional standards.  The pair, especially Somers, have a respectable list of film and TV credits, including some it more or less main stream flicks.  The acting is at the bottom of what we expect from professionals but it is the absurd and meaningless plot that sinks the project.
 The film is not rated but should carry an R.  It is an interminable hour and a half long.  This film with all its flaws rates a strong two brains.  Fans of semi-nude semi-attractive women will be the main audience for this effort.  True Zombie fans will give it a pass.",1410825600,2,1685,4.553333333333334
1745486,2,B00006FDBK,"the only reason this is getting 2 stars is because it really is amusing to watch, but every aspect of this movie is *bad.*  From the plot to the writing to the acting, to the soundtrack.  Its the second-worst movie I've ever seen next to South Beach Academy.  Still, it's worth seeing once, just to laugh at it.",1185494400,2,311,4.327586206896552
1745487,3,B00006FDBK,"For all of you zombie movie fanatics, like me, who are looking to add rare, foreign and unique zombie movies to your collection:  I would seriously pass on this movie.  I purchased this movie based off the coment on the cover ""Night of the living dead meets Attack of the killer tomatoes.""  Um...I don't think so.  First off these are not zombies at all, let alone Romero's flesh eating back-from-the-dead zombies.  If anything it's more like...Invasion of the body snatchers meets some campy T&A movie.  Bascially a seductress moves into a small town wanting to open up a hair removal wax treatment spa.  After the customers are exposed to the hair removal wax treatment they become sex crazed and seek out to bring others to the spa.  The hero of the movie is a female lingerie store owner, and the villianess is always wearing something seductive.  It is kind of a funny T&A comedy, but definetly not a zombie movie.",1115510400,12,919,4.69375
1745488,5,B00006FDBK,Actually this is the best movie I've ever seen.  Don't judge a movie why its cover.  The problem with mainstream Hollywood is that you never hear about the better films of the year.  This is one of those you probably never heard about but...now you have.  Interesting.,1056067200,,268,4.638297872340425
7967570,5,B00006FDBK,"Granted this will not win any awards, but I found it funny and entertaining. The director obviously didn't intend for the film to be a serious horror film, and it's in the very presentation of it being a serious film that makes it funny. To me, this is a grab-a-beer-sit-and-giggle movie. It's a little slow in the first 15 minutes, but then seems to pick up tempo. The soundtrack is great! I've been looking for the soundtrack to buy, but can;t seem to find it. For anyone interested in seeing this - there's very little skin, though it does have some topless scenes. It's a romp, if you're in a silly mood. Having been around independent productions, the screen quality of this film is tremendous.",1523836800,,699,4.6
7967571,5,B00006FDBK,Lots of fun. Watch closely for the small stuff. Final scenes are great craziness on the beach coast highway. Fun cult movie for adults. Halloween is good time to watch also.,1508630400,2,173,4.612903225806452
7967572,1,B00006FDBK,terrible in a offensively bad way it's just bad. There's absolutely nothing here.  A campy T&A movie. Without the T&A. So your left with the campy only it's not really campy it's just dumb. So you got not a thing or as they say on the liberal coast nothing.,1507766400,,257,4.244897959183674

7967578,1,B00006FDBK,"There's absolutely nothing here to see, a complete waste of time.
It was free on Prime so I got lazy and didn't do the proper digging. This wreck was actually filmed in 1999 but really seems like some bad 80's thing. I was looking at the IMBD on this an some people defend it by saying critics are too serious, and not appreciating the humor.
Anyone that watches ""zombie"" genre movies has a high level of tolerance and this is just stupid. I fell asleep and missed about twenty minutes in the middle, so I guess I was lucky!
