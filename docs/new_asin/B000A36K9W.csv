2355391,5,B000A36K9W,I've been doing Pilates for a couple years now with another DVD and heard about the Cardio Flow option on More Than Mat Pilates and gave the Beginning DVD a try.  I absolutely LOVE IT!  It's great that the Cardio Flow option let's you do the workout straight through without all the stopping and starting there is in other DVD's.  I can't wait to buy the Intermediate DVD!!!,1138147200,5,374,4.470588235294118
2355392,5,B000A36K9W,I have been doing Pilates for about five years and found this to be an excellent video.  Sarah Picot is an excellent instructor.  The workout is managable yet challenging.,1128297600,10,171,4.862068965517241
2355393,5,B000A36K9W,"This is the best instructional pilates DVD! I really like the fact that Sarah has a section that shows you the basic moves and principles before you start the exercises. As a beginner, this allowed me to go back and make sure I was doing things correctly. It is a great work out and I know this is a DVD I will continue to use!",1123977600,11,327,4.046153846153846
2355394,5,B000A36K9W,"I'm a total newbie to Pilates but I was looking for something to help my stomach, so I tried Pilates on vacation with an instructor and machine and I liked it.  But I was worried that when I got back home I'd lose my way without the equipment.  But the ""Best Pilates"" CD was for me, the bridge, between the machine and doing mat work by myself a home.  Now I do it all with just myself and a mat and the disc and now I'm way into it, it just works great for me, I love it.",1122163200,15,472,3.795918367346939
8073760,5,B000A36K9W,I only wish I would have found this DVD in my 20s.  It has changed my life.  I have purchased it for my friends in the hopes they will find as much enjoyment as have I.,1457568000,,168,3.638888888888889
8073761,4,B000A36K9W,Good lesson,1426118400,,11,5.0
8073762,5,B000A36K9W,"I rate this as one of best instructional DVDs that I have purchased. This DVD is filmed well, with another person showing easier versions of what the instructor is performing. Everything is explained thoroughly. Excellent rating.",1369008000,,229,5.388888888888889
8073763,3,B000A36K9W,"My Pilates experience has been on a one-on-one basis with a certified instructor using a reformer. I started Pilates as a rehab regime for my lower back. My instructor is constantly stressing the importance of breath control. I really like the Pilates form of exercise and, in order to continue with my training, purchased this DVD (along with others) to use at home. In the description I liked the fact that  Picot ""modified"" the reformer exercises for the mat. Sorry for the lengthy intro. This is why I gave this DVD three stars: Pros: Most exercises are the essentials needed for every workout. Her explanation of these is very good. There is a bonus cardio section. She shows the exercise on the reformer first, so you know what you are doing (especially if you are familiar with those) Cons: While her verbal cuing is there, she doesn't take the time to instruct the correct breathing; which is the most important part of Pilates.  She has an instructor that does the modified exercises, but many times it's difficult to see what she is doing because Picot is center stage. I just feel this DVD will be monotonous after a while.",1361059200,,1134,4.693467336683417
8073764,2,B000A36K9W,"I have been doing Pilates a couple of times a week for about a year. I mostly do DVDs but I wish I could afford to take classes where you work on the reformer. I figured the second best would be to do this video where they incorporate exercises from the reformer. I started with the beginner version and planned to work up to the harder ones, but that may have been a mistake. The problem is that the exercises are so easy that I don't feel a thing and they don't work my body at all. I don't have the time to do an exercise DVD that doesn't even do anything. I now wish I'd bought the intermediate or the advanced instead, maybe one of those would have been better. I would recommend that if you have some experience with Pilates, you should not buy this DVD.",1273536000,4,760,4.141891891891892
8073765,5,B000A36K9W,"I am a complete newbie to Pilates and decided to start with this video.  I have to say, it exceeded my expectations.

Not only is there a full 24-minute work-out, but also sections where you're taught how to breathe and do the positions properly, before starting the workout.  It's highly advised in the video that you do this for at least 6 weeks before attempting the Advanced and Intermediate work-outs.

The video shows two women doing the exercises, one alittle more advanced than the other so you can choose which one to follow.  Throughout the work-out, you're told by voice-over exactly what to do (which I love).  She'll even say things like, ""Don't round your back"" or ""Keep your shoulders straight"", reminding you along the way.  Everytime she reminds me, I find that I'm doing the thing (like bending my shoulders when they should be straight) without realizing it.

Between each new position, the video shows how it's done on the actual pilates machine.  Some people may not like this, but I do.  I'm a very visual person and like seeing how it would have been done this way.  It only takes a few seconds.

I've asked for the other two DVDs for Christmas.  By then, I'll be ready!  I appreciate all the people who left such nice reviews because that's what made me buy this specific one over the others.",1254268800,5,1316,4.640692640692641
8073766,5,B000A36K9W,"I have all three of Sarah Picot's DVDs. If you are a first-timer to pilates, she couldn't be a better teacher. When I got to the intermediate, people at work began to comment that I looked better and more tone. Try it, be consistent and it will work. If it took you 10-20 years to get flabby, it will take you more than three weeks to change but have some patience, it will come. And Sarah Picot's DVD will help you get there.",1246147200,6,426,4.144578313253012
8073767,3,B000A36K9W,This DVD is really kind of ho-hum.  Sarah goes through the moves but it has a whole surreal feel to it.  The DVD does not last long enough for you to get a good feeling like you are actually working something.  This is a great DVD if you want to start off at the bottom of the physical fitness ladder but not so great if you have any core muscles whatsoever.,1183939200,2,358,4.014084507042254
8073768,5,B000A36K9W,I have purchased several beginner's pilates mat workout DVD's and this is by far the best one. Sarah Picot is an awesome instructor and I love when exercise DVD's show how to modify the exercises. I recommend this highly and notice results doing pilates.,1176595200,3,254,4.795454545454546
8073769,5,B000A36K9W,"I've never done any form of Pilates and this is very informative as it shows you how to do each move and provides easier options to each pose.  I highly recommend this, plus you can feel it working on your abs immediately!!  Enjoy!",1142380800,9,231,4.348837209302325
