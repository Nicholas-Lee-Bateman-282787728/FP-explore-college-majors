5057276,5,B00760RZK0,"This film is excellent! I've seen several other productions from this company and all are very well made. The Replacement gODS clearly and unequivocally outlines the relationship between the comic/fantasy/superhero ideology and the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Not only is the film entertaining and very well produced, it is still more enlightening than it is entertaining. I highly recommend this to anyone that wants to know more about the world we live in and how society shapes our world-view.",1328572800,8,492,5.2405063291139244
5057277,5,B00760RZK0,"I rated this dvd a five star because of the biblical truths that have been told about these superheros. It is blasphemy to use God's Words to create these imaginary characters. I never thought that these ideas came from using God's Word. I use to watch these superheros myself and grew up with these fictional characters and their actions, but now that I am older and I know the truth I will no longer watch them anymore. If you truly love GOD then this is the dvd that you must have. God is looking for people who will truly serve HIM in Spirit and in Truth. The God of Heaven through Jesus Christ is the real HERO, and one day will soon return in the clouds with HIS Holy Angels to redeem the saints and but an end to sin. God Bless! :)",1355011200,,738,4.1678321678321675
5057278,5,B00760RZK0,I was a huge super hero fan and collector but began to see many things in the artform that conflicted with my faith. This very well made documentary explained very well why this type if entertainment is not meant for Christians. I hatewas biased conspiracy theories but this was backed up by good historical  research and bible fact.,1353801600,4,333,4.741379310344827
5057279,5,B00760RZK0,In this movie your eyes will be forever opened. You will realize things in your past you never knew in a new light. I believe everyone will get a blessing from watching this video. Especially if you are a Christian and especially if you aren't! Don't miss out on the opportunity. The watch is well worth your money.,1342483200,,315,4.448275862068965
5057280,5,B00760RZK0,All the other reviewers put it rather well.  This should be required viewing for families as it explains exactly what is going on in the movie/comic industry.  Very well done!,1340755200,,175,4.8
5057281,5,B00760RZK0,my daughter and i watched the video. this is very informative for us parents and our children. i fully recommend it to all parents.,1335744000,,131,4.5
5057282,5,B00760RZK0,"If any of you have loved or still love Superhero flicks, and the history behind these masked heroes, this is for YOU. The documentary goes behind the scenes of MANY well-known superheros and reveals the secrets and hidden agendas of these mythical characters AND how they affect our perception of many things in this life. NOTHING in the media is showed/placed/said by accident; every movie/song/art-piece/video game you have ever indulged in is feeding you doctrines and values that you may at times subconsciously assimilate. This movie seeks to expose all the devices that are surreptitiously placed in many of those block-buster flicks we have grown up on, and continue to indulge in. You will never be the same after this. God bless you all - keep your eyes open",1332028800,2,767,4.953488372093023
5057283,5,B00760RZK0,"This documentary will surely change the way you view comic books. In this current trend of mega-Hollywood remakes of comic book heroes, this is an appropriately timed documentary that will surely spark the thoughts of people who are interested in things of truth. Little Light Studios has done several presentations about different forms of entertainment, but this is by far the most in-depth one yet. It has certainly opened my eyes to movies that I once enjoyed and blew the lid off what the enemy is really trying to do through the movie industry. May we all be more conscious of the things that we watch.",1331251200,2,608,4.745283018867925
5057284,5,B00760RZK0,"I was quite impressed with this production on the concerning agenda of the comic book industry with regard to the presentation of Christ motifs and Luciferian representations, as well as the extensive draw upon Egyptian and Greek mythology.",1328659200,,240,5.342105263157895
5057285,5,B00760RZK0,"We are living in a time where there are decisive influences battling for our attention and for our minds.  The truth is often not the easiest pie to sell, but nevertheless, it is the truth.  I believe Little Light has a great track record of exposing subtle spiritual snares which confront us as a daily mine field.  ""The Replacement gods"" is no exception.  In addition, I believe this documentary establishes Little Lights technical skills as being competitive with the high standards of the modern market, and because of the untainted content and the artful presentation, I would have to say Little Light is a humble yet provocative asset to the world of Christian media.",1328572800,,673,4.87719298245614
5057286,5,B00760RZK0,"I have seen several other presentations from Little Light Studios, which were very eye opening.  They caused us to take a closer look at what we were watching on television.  We were looking forward to seeing what the Replacement gods was going to be about, and when we watched it we were amazed at the comparisons that were made and were inspired to consider more carefully what we view in the media.  This movie far exceeded our expectations and we plan to buy extra copies to share with others.",1328572800,,497,4.561797752808989
5057287,5,B00760RZK0,I absolutely loved this movie. I think every human being on the planet that loves super heroes should watch this! Little Light is an amazing group of individuals and I hope they continue creating these movies to educate this plant! Maranatha!,1328572800,,242,4.926829268292683
5057288,5,B00760RZK0,"This documentary is the definition of excellence. I watched it 3 times on my own in a week, and I couldn't keep from showing it to all of my friends. It begins, literally, from the dawn of time, looking at the evolution of gods from mythology to superheroes. It is insanely thought-provoking. Great interviews with the writers behind the heroes and ultimately great enlightenment at the end of the film. Five Stars! Great work, Little Light Studios. I highly recommend all their films.",1328572800,2,485,4.855421686746988
5057289,5,B00760RZK0,"Must see you'll love it!
This video makes you realize
the hidden agenda of the movie industry
YOU NEED TO WATCH THIS!",1328572800,3,117,4.363636363636363
5057290,5,B00760RZK0,This documentary opened up my eyes to the evils contained within super hero movies and comic books. I never knew how much these things were steeped in occultism and how subtle this evilness is infiltrating our societies. This is a must watch. I will never watch another super hero movie or show again.,1328572800,2,301,4.69811320754717
5057291,5,B00760RZK0,"I have also seen several of the presentations Little Light has done. These guys have topped themselves with this documentary. It was not only interesting, but clear in its attempts to show the link between our modern day super hero's with the those of mythology and paganism. Thus it shows clearly, and well documents and supports, the two sides drawn in the great battle between the Christian Christ, ""the author of truth"", and Satan, ""the author of lies."" Even if you are not a Christian, or even a person of faith, you will find this presentation thought provoking and worth your time.",1328572800,4,588,4.7745098039215685
5057292,5,B00760RZK0,"This film was amazing. I didn't realize how we are so deceived by what is in all these films and how we all seem to think that we are all ok even if we know that it is evil. If you haven't seem this, you NEED to see it.",1328572800,2,219,3.489795918367347
5057293,5,B00760RZK0,"This video is an interesting, and eye-opening look into society's fascination with superheroes. It will challenge you to look beyond the surface of a movie or comic strip, and see what message lies beneath.  Definitely worth watching and passing along!",1328572800,3,252,5.3
5057294,5,B00760RZK0,well made. openned my eyes on the messages behind the characters used on certain films. made me want to focus more on Christ because Satan is really out there searching to kill and to use every little door that we leave open.,1328572800,2,225,4.380952380952381
5057295,5,B00760RZK0,This is one of the best documentaries I have seen. You won't regret buying this dvd. It is a must see dvd. Thank you Little Light Studios!,1328572800,2,138,4.148148148148148
5057296,5,B00760RZK0,"This video will open your eyes to the deception and twists and turns that causes complete and utter confusion...your beliefs will change for the better, if you choose to!",1328572800,2,170,4.896551724137931
8510694,5,B00760RZK0,This blew me away! I never realized any of this! I loved all those characters as a child and never suspected there was a sinister plan behind it all. Definitely recommend to all Christians.,1487116800,,189,4.588235294117647

8510697,5,B00760RZK0,There is spiritual warfare going on all around us.  Many Christians are unknowingly inviting this evil into our homes.  This DVD exposes some of Satan's deceptions involving the superhero craze.  It is a must-see for all true Bible-believing Christians.,1406160000,,253,5.435897435897436
8510698,4,B00760RZK0,"I would have liked to have had this information when I was a kid in the 50`s. No wonder society is like it is today with these comics being read over and over and all the violent videos out there for kids now. I remember when the gov. took off the air the Road Runner and Wiley coyote show saying they were two violent. No more Yogi Bear , Heckel and Jeckel, cartoons, just violence now, at least in the 50`s the comic book heroes did not portray themselves as gods. May God have mercy on those feeding our kids this kind of garbage today",1398643200,,538,4.133333333333334
8510699,5,B00760RZK0,"This product works. It does what it says, arrived in good condition and able to use it for my purpose. I believe it is an important work on revealing the lines of thinking and purpose behind some of the agendas in the different media throughout the world. It shows that some in the media try to replace Christ and or twist Biblical themes to foster their own world views over that of the God of the Bible as well as both the our need for and true nature of our salvation.",1375056000,,471,4.186813186813187
8510700,5,B00760RZK0,I have been waiting for some time for a documentary like this to be made by professionals! God bless you Little Light Studios!,1374364800,,126,4.521739130434782
8510701,5,B00760RZK0,"I watched part of this video on a friend's laptop and was intrigued. After watching the whole thing, I was socked. The authors have done their research",1368576000,,151,4.62962962962963
8510702,3,B00760RZK0,"When I was a kid there was a popular book out.  It was called Turmoil in the Toybox.  It terrified my parents and cost me my Transformers and GI Joe's.  Having read it all these years later under the lens of God's word, I found it lacking.  As a minister it is always good to see brothers and sisters in Christ putting out such a highly polished product.  That being said, I was a little let down by much of the videos content.  I spent years before seminary studying the parallels of mythology and Biblical literature with that of our modern day comic books and graphic novels.  While it is a relief that someone has finally packaged the information about Allan Moore and Grant Morrison in an accessible and quite credible medium; much of the rest was a bit contrived.  For instance, the story of Superman actually parallels that of Moses, not Jesus.  I actually did a report on that one back in the day.  When it comes to other interpretations of Greek and Latin mythology in modern form I have seen no evidence that people (especially the kids) see them as anything but myth and allegory.  When it comes down to it, I fear that if Jesus were to walk among us today he would find himself recognized by very few.  Not however, because of comics and movies, but because the church at large has tried to recreate him in their own image.  Making him either republican or democrat, rich or poor, white or black, etc.  Sadly, he would be unceremoniously run out of most churches these days.  The problem is that we need to teach Jesus Christ, the son of God.  Lover of man, Savior of all, Friend to sinners, Servant to those in need.  God Bless and may God have mercy.",1368489600,4,1664,4.421052631578948
8510703,5,B00760RZK0,"This is a great video. It unveils the inspiration for the comics, and their subtle messages. I think everyone who has ever stopped to wonder why we live in such a broken, irreligious, and irreverent society should watch it-and even those who haven't. Whether you agree or disagree, it's still interesting to watch, and great food for thought!",1360108800,,342,4.913793103448276
