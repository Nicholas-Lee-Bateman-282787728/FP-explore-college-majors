8660398,5,B006B909FA,"A great introduction to the stories of the baal shem tov! He started chassidisim by focusing on the beauty and simplicity of the simple Jew's relationship with G-d, and the video keeps the stories simple for young children to understand (although some discussion with Mom and Dad couldn't hurt). The video emphasizes faith in G-d and that G-d affects every part of our lives. But even if the stories are a little over their head, the music is great. The scenery and costumes are also impressive. A few minutes in, it's easy to forget that the actors are actually little girls with beards glued on. (It looks more sophisticated than that!) The grand dance finale can't be beat. My oldest is 4, and I think that I might like this video a little more than my kids right now (they ask for Boker Tov), but I'm sure they'll appreciate it EVEN MORE when they're bigger.

I've probably seen it with them well over 10 times.

I highly recommend this video!",1344297600,2,947,4.564705882352941
