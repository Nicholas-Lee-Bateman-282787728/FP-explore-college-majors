8050510,5,B0007QCLJK,"A good Spanish language (no subtitles but at a verbal pace so that an advanced language student can follow & understand) film about Mexican life in the 1940s. Along with a young Nion, both acting and entertaining, El Trio Los Panchos also entertain; possibly the originals. Also, and the only time I have seen him act, is Augustine Lara. Years ago, one write called him, ""The Hoagy Carmicle(sp?) of Mexico"".",1323907200,2,407,4.828571428571428
8050511,5,B0007QCLJK,"This movie is not a sappy love story.  This is a typical cabaretera film about a woman who is taken advantage of and life seems to cute her down. This melodrama is a great film of it's time and the musical numbers are fantastic. The ending song ""Tu Solo Tu"" was a familiar song because Selena did a cover to it in the 1990s.",1314489600,,324,4.0625
8050512,5,B0007QCLJK,This a wonderful movie of old. A very sad story that made me cry. Everything turned not O.K. for this lady. It's a good story.,1206662400,4,126,4.08
