5934959,5,B00ERH1718,"Truly one of the best shows ever made. My view of the three parts is very different than most peoples. First off my favorite part is The Robotech Masters, I don't care what anyone says.  But to be fair even I have to admit it does take a few episodes to get going. Then The New Generation is next, always thought this parts strength is that from the first episode there is a main goal: Get to Reflex Point and join up with the remaining REF forces.  Last is The Macross Saga, which I do like , but I find overrated. Dont get me wrong, I think its good, but I really like the other parts of the series better. If getting the whole series isn't enough, this new set is worth getting for the new extras alone. Robotech: The Sentinels Movie has been remastered and looks a lot better, it also has been re-edited. Also Robotech finally gets a making of, with Carl Maceks Robotech Universe and it is really quite informative.  They even edited all The Masters footage together from Robotech the Movie into its own mini movie that actually kind of works on its own. (They could not use the Megazone 23 footage cause of rights). Truly worth getting even if you have the old Legacy sets or the Protoculture Collection.

Update
As far as my thoughts on this new set it is nice too see an updated version with The Shadow Chronicles and Love, Live, Alive in it.  And also a new disc of extras... I like the packaging but its not the best ether... At least its not like the initial packaging for Back to the Future Blu Ray set.  But it holds everything fine.
I get why some people are irked at Harmony Gold and Lionsgate about this set having a disc of new extras  but that happens all the time Also  I really am not a fan of the Max Sterling face shot on the  box (Why didn't they use Rick instead) but oh well. It is worth it for anyone who has never gotten any of the past sets before. Is it worth it for everyone else thats up to you, if you have the last set with the green cover and the two disc Shadow Chronicles, LLA set you are done. But if you want everything together and some new stuff It is worth it. At least in my opinion.",1386288000,10,2124,4.17359413202934
5934960,4,B00ERH1718,"Robotech The Complete Set has its flaws. Years of rereleasing the same material has ultimately worn the fresh look of this saga down.

Harmony Gold should have thrown these into the remastering mix and released a much awaited Blu Ray release of these titles. Instead, we have received what most people already own at least twice. Regurgitation has become a common occurence for Harmoony Gold.

The collection includes the 85 episode saga along with all the movies with the exception of the now vastly edited Robotech Movie due to licensing issues. Its sad because i rather liked this movie and feel that something special was taken away.

Had you already purchased the 2 movie collection earlier this year of Love, Live , Alive & The Shadow Chronicles, you will be double dipping as they are here too along with more features not given to buyers before.

The biggest problem is that you will go out and buy this complete set & think you have it all. Then Harmony Gold will release an Ultimate Set with something they never added before. Followed by a Super Duper Set and so on

Its the Star Wars bug and you have to question yourself at one point, when do you finally say, I have it all? Packaging has also been an issue with this collection. Discs on top of one another is not exactly a preferred solution. Should these get damaged, thats your collection gone Bye Bye.

If you don't have the collection yet and you still prefer DVD, this is a nice set with its mentioned flaws HOWEVER, if you already own any of the previous dozen sets released, there is little here to tickle your buying frenzy.",1386115200,46,1597,4.585964912280701
5934961,3,B00ERH1718,"Yes this is the show you watched as a kid...  Unfortunately that poor representation of an anime was a butchered copy of Macross cobbled together with Southern Cross, and Mospeada.  If you're a true fan...watch the originals.",1385942400,5,225,5.054054054054054
5934962,5,B00ERH1718,"Great set! However, I just bought it at Walmart for $39!!! Walmart's website is also selling it for $79, just like Amazon. Go save the $40 and thank me later.",1384560000,14,158,4.3
5934963,5,B00ERH1718,"I've been a fan of the series since I first watched it in the 80's, and now I own this set. I highly recommend it to people who know the series, as well as those who just enjoy anime. The digital transfer looks good, and the sound is top notch. I haven't checked out the bonus materials yet, so I will have to edit this later. However, this is the first time I have been able to watch it episode for episode from the beginning, and I'm enjoying it immensely. As a kid, I only caught a handful of episodes because it was on very early on weekday mornings, but I was intrigued. I even read the first few novelizations of the series when I was in junior high, but I never had the complete experience.
The only complaint I have is the design of the case. I'm not sure how any of the previous DVD releases were packaged, but this one comes in a single case with internal hinged panels. Multiple discs reside on a single peg, which means having to re-stack the discs as you watch the series, or later when you want to watch it again. With 20 discs on six panels, there is added opportunity to scratch them. I plan to keep the case, but purchase a separate DVD storage unit to provide more protection to the individual discs.
I'm so happy to own this series on DVD, but the DVD case leaves something to be desired. I did not purchase this set from Amazon as I found a cheaper price elsewhere, but I would have been willing to pay more for the privilege of owning this great series.",1384128000,14,1474,4.212014134275618
5934964,3,B00ERH1718,"I got mixed feelings about this set. On the one hand, it seems the perfect choice for anyone who hasn't yet gotten the 85 Remastered eps and movies on DVD and in some ways it can be argued that, but it does have its faults. The packaging is terrible in my honest opinion, discs are stacked on top of each other all for the sake of saving space, some coming loose surprisingly easy despite being very careful with how I was handling the case. This was a very risky call by Lion's Gate, I far more prefer the packaging of A&E's prior Complete sets (even ADV's Protoculture set as well), I understand A&E, Lion's Gate, and Harmony Gold wanted to release this to meet popular demand of Robotech from people that have never gotten it on this format and the dwindling amount of prior sets' stock in stores, but this was pretty dang lazy.

On to things I did like, the packaging art is quite beautiful, though I have more of a preference liking to the prior A&E set's trio images of updated character designs (sorta like FUNi's Collector's Edition of The Shadow Chronicles and the Prelude comics' TPB). The new Extras disc is quite simply incredible and I really wish that would've been offered as a separate online purchase, truly it should've came with the 2-Movie collection of Love Live Alive and The Shadow Chronicles back in July IMO. It's got pretty awesome documentaries on Love Live Alive, the Robotech series itself (produced back in the 80s), pretty cool deleted scenes of Love Live Alive and its original Mospeada version, plus other neat bits making it worth checking out. If it weren't for this disc alone, I wouldn't have shelled out for this set which for someone like myself (having both the Protoculture and prior A&E Complete sets), isn't worth keeping.

Know this fellow fans, if you've already purchased the prior A&E Complete set and 2-Movie release from this year, there's virtually no reason to get this unless you 1) REALLY want that new extras disc or 2) gotten rid of your other set(s). Also, don't let the advertisement of ""All Special Features From Previously Released DVDs"" fool you, this release does lack some that were on the Legacy and Protoculture sets. This includes the ""Point of View"" Carl Macek interview, Codename: Robotech, The Sentinels' original version, among other features that were on those ADV sets (like certain easter-egg promos). But otherwise, all prior extra features from A&E's Complete Set and the 2-Movie release are here.

Ultimately you will get the entire Robotech story as so far released, including:

The Macross Saga -- Eps 1-36
Robotech: The Sentinels (Remastered)
The Masters -- Eps 37-60
The New Generation -- Eps 61-85
The Shadow Chronicles
Love Live Alive

(The short Robotech 3000 promo is also included, as is a tweaked version of the Untold Story Robotech movie, the latter edited for licensing issues to remove the Megazone 23 material and not in nearly as good video quality as the rest of the set's story)

5934983,4,B00ERH1718,"The premature death of Carl Macek in 2010 probably brought an end to a quarter century of churning of this critical work of American/Japanese Animation; this set probably marks the final state.  Fans who've never bought much of anything can add a star....

Discs 1-5, also available separately as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robotech-The-Macross-Saga/dp/B005DTGAW0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robotech: The Macross Saga</a>, contain the famous first series, and to my surprise this founder of the Japanese Macross series (I swear I think they've issued more entries than Gundam has) holds up pretty well despite its age.  36 episodes is long enough to tell its story in three mostly uniform arcs: Contact to Earth, Earth to Final Battle, and Aftermath, and though the battle animation now seems pretty primitive, the character animation holds up pretty well.  Of the three romance arcs, the military one is too tragic (I swear there is more time spent AFTER one of them has died than before), the human-Zentraedi one is too short (I think one complete episode and enough time to add up to another one would be the total), and the big four main one will have you yelling at the screen until Rick Hunter FINALLY gets a clue in episode 36, but at least in the category of memorable romances it works pretty well.

Unfortunately, discs 6-9, also available separately as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robotech-The-Masters-Saga/dp/B005DTGB56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robotech: The Masters Saga</a>, are pretty awful; it speaks volumes that the best part of this series were the parts added to try and make the heroine the daughter of the famous human-Zentraedi pair from the first series.  In addition to her, the former leader busted to private for dating the wrong girl, the genius who cannot grasp the importance of improving survivability in actual combat, the musician who is the foster child of the general in charge, and the ""in MY day"" sergeant who after crying and moaning pitches in to the wackiest schemes the ditsy blonde leader comes up with will have you rooting for the other side, which unfortunately keeps losing to the ""heroes"".  There are also about three different romances in this shorter series (23 episodes originally); it speaks volumes that only the one between the human-Masters couple is obvious without reading notes.

Finally, discs 10-13, also available separately as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robotech-The-New-Generation/dp/B005DTGATI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robotech: The New Generation</a>, are an improvement (they'd have to be), but as critics have long noted, in addition to being a completely unrelated series from a different company (!), they are also pretty downbeat and depressing.  In the grind, Grind, GRIND of relentless advance upon the enemy stronghold, 25 episodes tend to alternate between depressing past events involving members of the fighting group and depressing current events involving the people they meet along the way.  Again, there are three romances, but only the central one has any real feel to it; of the other two, one is too short and the other is too long and too boring.

Of the two most recent movies, discs 18-19, also available separately as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robotech-2-Movie-Collection/dp/B00CFK5J6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robotech: 2-Movie Collection</a>, are an improvement in visual data at the cost of time spent, but the most interesting thing is found on disc 17 of the remaining discs, the Robotech Archives discs 14-17 and Special Features disc 20:

Robotech: The Sentinels.

The New Version of 'Robotech II: The Sentinels' actually had some of the nostalgic footage removed from it for reasons I'm still not clear-on. You can still get the Correct Version as a stand-alone or as the Bonus Material Disc which came with the Original 3rd Box-Set DVD Release of Robotech: The Macross Saga (Pre Robotech Remastered) or you can get it in the Protoculture Collection Edition.  Those complaints and solutions being noted and set-aside the transfer seems to be fine and they did a good job with organizing the Bonus Materials.  Love, Live, Alive (originally Mospeada's Bonus Episode) has been Harmony Gelded and essentially ""Re-Imagined"" to serve as a bridge-piece between the TV Series and the Shadow Chronicles and other upcoming anime if they ever do any.  It remains to be seen if they'll do more or focus their energies on the Live-Action Production currently under way.

5935015,3,B00ERH1718,"The main reason a Blu ray set hasn't been released for Robotech is that Harmony Gold has little confidence that it will sell well in the current market.  Between illegal online streaming and bootlegging of DVDs and the general decline of the anime home video market, they're concerned a restoration effort for HD release will cost more than what they can make off the series at the current time.  I've heard this at cons where company reps were present.  (Not naming names but those who go to cons and attend the panels know who I'm talking about.)

(As for continuing Robotech productions, one of the main issues happens to be the licensing agreement between Harmony Gold and Warner Bros...  HG sat on doing ANY kind of follow-up to Robotech: Shadow Chronicles for years because they were waiting for WB to get a live-action film made which hasn't happened yet..  Now that live-action has gone back to square one and is within another production company which I'm sure is experiencing the same problems the LAST production company -- Tobey Maguire's -- had with the property.  How do you create decent-looking transforming mecha on a budget that doesn't bankrupt a company when Transformers is already costing $150million+ to produce?  Especially when the product you're developing isn't as well known as Transformers AND you can't use any of the vehicle or character designs from the original Macross series?)

Many years ago -- 10, 12, 13? -- Robotech was first released on DVD through ADV Films which licensed ALL the available series at the time and neat extras like the original pilot dubs for Macross and Mospeada (which in more edited forms became Robotech: The Macross Saga and Robotech: The New Generation respectively).  (Shadow Chronicles hadn't been made yet and they only released PART of the original Macross English dub pilot which used the Robotech actors.)  This was some time after AnimEigo did its own subtitled release of Macross on DVD.  ADV/HG used the remastered footage AnimEigo created from the 16mm dupes in HG's film vaults to later help create the Robotech Extended release -- AFTER the original broadcast tapes of Robotech were used to create the DVDs for the ""original Robotech.""

Extended has had its share of issues and I must admit I agree with the complaints about the added Foley effects.  They do tend to be distracting.  This was an unfortunate practice in the earlier days of DVD and many, many older cartoons released on DVD (mostly public domain shorts) were released in 5.1 audio with new sound effects.  On the other hand, it was nice to see the footage and audio that HAD been cut from the original version of Robotech and it's a lesson in and of itself of the evolution of standards and broadcasts rules and regulations.  If it weren't for the tag that ""animation is for kids,"" I doubt most of the original edits would have been made except to make time for commercials during the on-air broadcast of the series.

Now Macross itself HAS been released on Blu ray in Japan after what must be at least the second if not third (Japanese) restoration of the series for home video.  It IS a better restoration than the DVD releases in the States BUT it's substantially more expensive than the US releases and it doesn't have (bare minimum) subtitles, either!  It also has NOT improved the shabby animation and off-model character drawings in parts of the series, either.  The double-edged sword of high-definition is that it will NOT make glaring flaws less noticeable -- the exact opposite happens.  From what I have seen, the main benefit seems to be sweetened colors and sharper lines without some of the (noticeable) DVNR the US releases all had.",1450051200,,3689,4.850079744816587

Then, you got all the sequels and reboots, pachinko game bumpers, and even stuff with the Harmony Gold voice cast. I don't think there's enough white boards and conspiracy yarn to figure out the mess this franchise has become. Can someone chart out all the Macross/Robotech releases? Color code for animation studio and which ones the Harmony Gold US voice cast worked in. I don't think anybody can make sense of this until we see that.",1438387200,,640,4.723214285714286

It is my understanding that the company that owns the IP that is Robotech keeps re-releasing these but this set doesn't really add anything new. The dvds are fine although it is clear the content was originally made for tv and lower resolution.

The series itself is old and really isn't of the highest quality. The main buyers of the set are those who already know about the show from childhood or someone who is into old school anime.

5935112,4,B00ERH1718,"I missed the Robotech bandwagon, as i was not born at the time of its American release. When i saw that this complete series was on sale for a very reasonable price, i picked it up.

I haven't finished the entire series yet (i'm about 20 episodes into the first part), but i have been pleasantly surprised with what i've seen. The animation is of an older style, and hasn't aged particularly well, but the writing is actually pretty clever with some strong sci-fi ideas. The dubbing is also surprisingly good, especially for an anime this old (released in the US in 1985), with the exception of the female lead at times. She gradually becomes a pop idol within the story, but her english voice actor's singing is pretty underwhelming. This is a minor complaint though; especially for this time, the voice acting is excellent.

The packaging is a little awkward, as multiple discs are stacked on top of each other, meaning that in order to get some of the DVDs out you need to take out 3 more. Those DVDs are REALLY fastened in there, too; you have to be careful not to break them getting them out. All in all, though, the box looks very nice on a shelf.

I was very surprised that all of the discs (over 20 of them) were present in the set i ordered. My brother had had some issues ordering used shows on DVD, with some discs being missing or the wrong discs being present. I not only received the show within 3 days of ordering it, but the discs were clean and all accounted for. Excellent service.

While i enjoy this show quite a bit, it is quite obviously intended for a younger audience (except for a few puzzling PG-13 nudity scenes; nothing excessive, but weird for its inclusion in a show much in the style of GI Joe or Jem and the Holograms). If you enjoy older anime, silly sci-fi, or want to give a middle school sci-fi fan something neat, check this set out.

Edit: I finished the show, and the first part is definitely the strongest part of the series. For those of you who don't know, three completely unrelated anime were packaged, re-edited, and dubbed over into a single (mostly) coherent show many years before most Americans had ever heard of anime. Thus, each show used is pretty distinctive on its own. The second two parts are decent enough, but it is clear that the source material of the first part, Macross, is much stronger and is in general the much more compelling story. Overall, a solid watch.

The special features are perhaps TOO extensive. The making-of retrospectives and films are interesting and well done, but unless you have an intense interest in 45-minute-long promotional toy videos you don't need to dive too deeply into the special features. I will say that the collection of deleted scenes, left out for content or pacing purposes, have quite a bit of unintentional entertainment value. When played, each clip is on average only a few seconds long, and are without a dub or subtitles. Maybe others won't find it as amusing as i did, but i found, when played as a sequence, the collage of scenes ranging from over-lingering shots of Minmei's rear to random old dudes chatting in a soup kitchen to be endlessly amusing with the denial of any narrative context.

In conclusion, my review still holds up; a solid purchase for anyone who may be interesting in old school, sometimes goofy, animated sci-fi.",1398816000,3,3344,4.600671140939597

sour grapes normally isn't my thing anyway.

It has aged well enough, but the artistry is a bit dated compared to modern anime.  It is one of the originals of scifi anime though and it did pretty much everything right.

Dislikes: Sometimes, that main character-ish kid can be highly annoying.  I don't remember him being that annoying when I was a kid.

Normally, I tend to be in the camp that says ""don't rewatch shows/movies you loved as a child"" because your memories of them tend to far surpass what they really were.

second time to be remastered. This set contains all the 85 discs of the the whole series. Robotech complete series. Macross Saga, Masters Saga, And new generation. And the discs of extra features. And 3 movies. All together a full 20
disc collector set. All packed in a hard plastic case with the discs of on spindles according to the respective parts of the story. The case closes like a clam shell so the discs protected and can be carried easily.
  I have viewed the discs and i will admit its just as good as the show first aired on TV back in the 80s. Its an uncut version of the series that aired on TV with all the edited scenes. Still its just as good. It retains the original back ground music we've all come to know and enjoy and sound effects. The sound is more crisp. And high quality. I can watch it over and over again and still enjoy it.
 Do I recommend it? Yes. To any robotech fan or anyone collecting anime dvds. Its a collection worth keeping. For its relail price you get 20 discs. All three parts of the series and three movies. Its a good real. How can anyone beat.

5935135,1,B00ERH1718,"I have no problem with Robotech being a mix of 3 other series into one story. I'm submitting this poor rating because of what I consider a flawed presentation inherent in the product.

The trouble I have with this release is the mind-numbing, atrocious decision to change the sound effects. They are AWFUL. They sound clean and strong, but the replacement sounds chosen are nothing like the originals. They sound generic and cringe-worthy, especially those sound effects associated with the weaponry and veritech/mecha movements & mode changes.  The video/music presentation is clean considering the age of the material and constrained budget, but the sound effects used for these remastered episodes are newly sourced, and they fall short of the originals by miles. I verified the differences by referencing old copies sourced from broadcast.

I can visualize that a great deal of effort went into remastering the visuals and recreating the audio tracks, and likely under a tight budget given what I've recently read about the difficulties in the various releases over the years. But changing something as fundamental as the characteristic sounds of the old show kills the nostalgia that motivated my purchase in the first place, especially when the replacements are so grossly uninspired.

Somehow, the important fact of this significant difference was not mentioned in any review I read prior to purchasing this set. If you've never seen the show, then you won't know the difference. If you are not a detail-oriented person, then this difference versus the original would most likely not bother you.

5935141,1,B00ERH1718,"If you haven't seen robotech, it's important that you know the actual truth:

Robotech is not anime: it is a series of 3 anime that were reedited and dubbed, and the actual story material was thrown out and replaced by a storyline that was essentially made up. Since the dialogue has nothing to do with the original dialogue, and the story has only the loosest connection to the the original, this can't be called an anime: you can't have a movie or TV show, and throw out the the actual story and dialogue and just keep the picture. It's no longer the same show.

 If you have Beavis and Butthead dub Casablanca, it's not Casablanca anymore.

Robotech was a cheap jack attempt to cash in on a classic anime series, done with horrible rewriting and terrible dubbing. IT'S NOT A CLASSIC. MACROSS is a classic, Robotech is mutilation of a classic. You can't make something great 'better' by ruining it. Macross is considered a classic the world over...Robotech is loved by a few people with arrested development, in some of the english speaking countries.
So why was this schlock ever made in the first place?

. Carl Macek got away with this merely because he had no competition at all. As soon as there was a choice, he went bankrupt. Macek never 'created' anything, he merely took other people's work and vandalized it. Don't take my word for it: check out his entry in the IMDB. He's considered a purveyor of schlock, and takes credit for works he had nothing to do with creating. That's his actual legacy.

 Every company that ever re-issued Robotech lost money, because the only people who will buy this are people who are fooled by calling it anime, and Robotech's perplexing fans.

 Let's face it, Robotech fans are a small group of people who are incapable of perceiving how bad it is. Sorry kids, even though you love it, it's horribly dubbed, and horribly written, as bad as possible in pretty much every way and virtually unwatchable. It's an embarrassment, not only to anime in particular, but to Americans in general: it makes us look bigoted, ignorant, and dumb.

If you are deaf or hard of hearing and depend on SDH or Closed Captioning for video, you should skip this one.

The box is nice and shiny foil with printing and it does have a lot of features including multiple movies. I did not check them all because of missing subtitle.  If I do have one other nitpick, the case is also not a great design as you'd need to remove multiple discs to get other discs out, and some discs popped out too easily.

8608768,5,B00ERH1718,"This release - ""Robotech: The Complete Set (RCS)""  - sells in late 2017 ""new"" for around $50, whereas only ""used"" versions of the Protoculture Collection are in an acceptable price range.  So if you want all the episodes in a compact space-saving case without going broke - The Complete Set would be the item to buy.  I will try later to list what is on the various ""bonus"" disks and how it may or may not compare to the previous ""Protoculture Collection (PC)"" release from 2005 and also what might have been contained on the individual releases of Shadow Chronicles and Love Live Alive.

Comparison with the older releases?:  I know there have been a series of different releases.. Legacy.. Classic.. Remastered... Etc.  Sound effects aside, what IS the difference so far as an image goes?  Being curious I ordered all seven ""sets"" in the Legacy release and compared a scene from Episode 1 (Legacy) with Episode 1 (TCS).  Picture is hopefully below, but from what I could see - when viewing both on my computer - the more recent release is sharper with better colors while showing a bit more of the total screen compared to the 1985/Legacy version.  Ex: Count the number of stripes on Claudia's sleeve.  However the ""artifacts"" (distortions) on the original version are still present on the later release. I circled two noticeable ones in red to have them stand out.
Another interesting tidbit is that it looks like the seven ""Elements of Robotechnology"" bonus disks from the seven Legacy sets are present in The Protoculture Collection.  The PC has - coincidentally - exactly seven bonus ""Elements of Robotechnology"" disks.

Comparison between RCS and PC?:
- RCS is 20 disks (13 episode disks + 7 ""extras disks"") while the PC is 21 disks (14 episode disks + 7 ""extras disks"").
- RCS can put as many as 8 episodes (Macross only) per DVD disk while PC limits itself to a max of 6 episodes per DVD disk.  So assuming both releases use the same ""remastered cut"" then perhaps the PC release is ""slightly better"" as having only 6 episodes per disk means less compression is being used and so... ""better quality""????
- RCS uses a nice compact plastic case with Double Spindles which hold 2 disks each.  Looks like there is room for 24 disks in the holder, so since there is room for four additional disks they COULD have stretched out the episodes to 6/disk and still had room leftover.
- PC is the older style of 1 disk/spindle, and includes a separate cardboard holder for the three series and the collection of ""extras"".

RCS disk layout:
Macross Saga (Disks 1-5)
Southern Cross (Disks 6-9)
New Generation (Disks 10-13)
""Extras"" Disks ""Robotech Archives"" (Disks 14-17)  <- ""Sentinels Movie"" included here.
Love Live Alive ""Premiere Release"" (Disk 18)
Shadow Chronicles ""Collectors Edition"" (Disk 19)
Special Features (Disk 20)

Not having jotted down (yet) what shows up in each DVD menu of the TCS, can't easily compare/contrast it with the PC.  But a quick glance at the PC's ""extra's index"" shows several matches.  I would assume that the 4 ""Robotech Archives"" disks probably contain much/all of what is on the 7 ""extras"" of the PC release.  As The Complete Set was released several years after the Protoculture Collection, 3 of TCS's disks contain content post-2005: Love Live Alive (2013), Shadow Chronicles (2006), and a ""Special Features"" disk which contains mostly ""extras"" relating to Love Live Alive.

Fans know that the eighty-five episodes of what we call Robotech were created from the three independent Japanese animation series of Macross, Southern Cross, and Mospeada.  The three-ish episodes of the (unfortunately) failed Robotech/Macross Saga sequel were crafted together to form the ""Sentinels Movie"" back in 1988.  In 2006 The Shadow Chronicles film was released to take up where Robotech/New Generation left off with hopes it would lead to future films.  Unfortunately this did not pan out and Shadow Chronicles was all we were going to get.  2013's Love Live Alive was a few minutes of new footage added into the original 1985 Mospeada release.  With a special note to ""Robotech the Movie/The Untold Story"" as I think it is included (sort of) in The Complete Set.  Or at least 29 minutes of it might be.  RTM/TUS was (if memory serves) made from a combination of parts of Megazone 23 and Southern Cross, but for Legal Reasons the Megazone 23 portions are removed - leaving 29 minutes (?).  I also read that TCS's version of ""The Sentinels Movie"" has the Macross Saga's flashback scenes removed, but if memory serves they dubbed in different vocals for those scenes, so not exactly a great loss.

It's been a while since Robotech was originally aired.  Back then all that was available were whatever one managed to record off-the-air with a VCR.  The first ""official"" VHS releases were usually ignored as the geniuses who threw those together opted to ""trim the episodes down"" as an incentive to get fans to NOT purchase them.  If one already has a more complete (and Free!) OTA copy on video tape, why pay $$$$ for a edited version?  Eventually common sense returned and ""complete"" releases began trickling out.  If memory serves, the ""legacy"" series began to appear piecemeal on DVD followed by the ""remastered"" episodes and finally the ""remastered complete sets"".

I was browsing over the contents of the ""extras"" and noticed a blurb which stated that when Robotech first aired, they didn't have the soundtrack completely added in yet, and this was tacked on in later re-airings.  It might explain why there are versions of the opening credits with and without additional sound effects.  That being said, one complaint I have read about the ""remastered"" edition is that it has Too Many additional sound effects, possibly even to the point where it could distract from the program itself.  Having been through the trimmed-down VHS releases, I tend to favor the versions that have the least amount edited out, and these ""remastered"" editions appear to have restored portions of the show that originally ended up on the cutting room floor.  I believe the Legacy release has the original sound effects circa 1985, but lacks the quality of the ""remastered"" releases.  So it's a trade off - original 1980s video cassette vs Legacy (If you can find those) vs The Complete Set.

(FYI: NEW ROBOTECH RELATED ITEM FOR SALE SOON)
I wandered back into the realms ""pull out money and buy Robotech Stuff"" as it would seem that around December 19th 2017 a new ""Robotech Book"" is hitting the market.  Allegedly the first of new four ""Art Style"" books (I guess if the first sells well) so Shameless Plug Alert - if enough fans buy the first book, we might get volumes 2-4 as well.  Book is called the ""Robotech Visual Archive: The Macross Saga"" and at the time of this writing is about three weeks away from shipping.  It can (of course) be purchased on Amazon.  Link would be  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1772940232/

Throwing even more money at Robotech in 2017:  I keep forgetting that it isn't exactly difficult to search Amazon.com for other related stuff..  So I searched for ""Robotech Legacy Collection"" and seems all 7 sets are available (used) on Amazon.  I am spoiled by Prime's free shipping, and buying all 7 sets from Third Party Sellers runs about $24.00 in collected shipping costs.  But the Legacy sets themselves are a good price as they run ""used"" at about $5-$7/each.  Each of the seven sets has a ""bonus"" disk and coincidentally the Protoculture Collection also has seven bonus disks..  Guess I will find out if the extras are indeed the same for all three versions.  :)
...and the Legacy versions should theoretically be of not-so-great visual quality but have the exact sound effects circa 1985.",1511827200,12,7727,4.875191424196019
