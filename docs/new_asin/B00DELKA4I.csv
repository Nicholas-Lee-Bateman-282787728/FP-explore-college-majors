8592564,5,B00DELKA4I,"Wow, I enjoyed it.  The funny thing is that the Villain was more interesting than the good guys.  Special effects were pretty decent and overall campy and fun.  It's more for adults than for children...it doesn't drag as much as other Japanese live action movies.  I recommend it for people who like live action hero movies that also enjoy campy humor.",1422057600,,352,4.721311475409836

8592566,3,B00DELKA4I,"It was a little campy, and some of the cultural differences in humor made some parts seem more creepy than funny.  One scene in particular was so unimportant, and mind numbingly pointless, it had no business being called a scene.  However, if your looking for something that is not so deep, but simply entertaining I would recommend this, it is fun, and the majority of the silliness is entertaining.  My only recommendation to potential consumers of this product is that you research the tv show before watching the movie, otherwise you may miss a large number of references (this movie was clearly made for viewers already familiar with the Yatterman franchise).",1398902400,,664,4.963963963963964
8592567,4,B00DELKA4I,"Yatterman is strange yet funny and comical. The hot bad girl and ok guys remind me of team rocket from Pokemon since their machines keep getting blown up and they get blasted and they have a bicycle for three. This film also reminds me of final fantasy, such as Vanille's weapon and moogles.
 Yatterman seems to lose battles and gets destroyed a little to easy but the main heros, yatterman 1 and 2 were cool and well likable. The fighting and music number were enjoyable. The coolest weapons were the big fork and spoon the bad boys used in the opening.
 Overall, it can get over the top sometimes, the translating is junk though you can figure out what they really mean, and there is a lot of sexual stuff as well, such as the bad guys big robots. One's a girl who shoots ammo from her breasts and the other's a guy who shoots from his... you know... I dunno what the rating for this is, but I doubt it's sutiable for little kids, which stinks since Yatterman was a cartoon to begin with. Yet,I still enjoyed the film for some reason. I'd watch it again and it's worth checking out. Just like Onechanbara 2 and Rec 2, I got my copy at ToynJoys.",1284076800,,1146,4.325581395348837
8592568,3,B00DELKA4I,"I am a big Takashi Miike fan who owns 44 of his films.  This is far from his best but probably not his worst.  It is hard to tell because the subtitles are beyond awful.  The grammar is horrible, incorrect words are used (like none for void and past for passed)and much of it just doesn't make sense which makes the story not make sense. I knew what it was supposed to be about so I filled in a lot of blanks while I watched it.

I is taken from a kid's show and seemed made for young children so I was surprised at the sexual content.  This includes a robot with human looking naked ""boobs"", which are weapons, gets aroused in a battle (with a dog-like robot)and begins thrusting while yelling ""Yes! Oh, yes!, I'm coming"".",1271203200,2,723,4.248175182481752
