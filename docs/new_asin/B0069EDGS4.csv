8495279,5,B0069EDGS4,"This vhs video covers the incredibly entertaining 1991 Dodger season narrated by Vin Scully. Highlights include the homecoming of Darryl Strawberry, the dramatic comeback of Orel Hershisher, the heated race in the west with the Atlanta Braves, profiles on key players, critical game outcomes and the success of Dodger Stadium. If you are a Dodger fan (especially of this era, like me), you will enjoy this 60 minute presentation tremendously. It was only made available in 1992 from the Dodgers via Mail. Today, this vhs is a VERY difficult find as I have only seen it offered on Amazon.com once over the past 7 years.",1431648000,,618,4.895238095238096
