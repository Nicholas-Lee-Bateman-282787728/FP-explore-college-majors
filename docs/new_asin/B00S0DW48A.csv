6938168,3,B00S0DW48A,"The early clues coupled with the DVD cover made the film very predictable as one might guess it is Thomas Tryon plus Troglodytes. A doctor (Sean Patrick Thomas) and his family move into the small, quaint, quirky community of Ashborough NH. The town has Isolates, an indigenous group that missed the early American genocide. They prove to be beyond annoying in a story that made as much sense as a Thomas Tryon novel with Troglodytes. The movie had a made-for-TV feel to it.

2 1/2 stars is generous.",1431734400,,499,4.670454545454546
6938169,3,B00S0DW48A,"Insidious thrills (and a few genuine scares) enliven what may have been a rather routine adaptation of Michael Laimo's ""penny dreadful"" novel of the same name, with Sean Patrick Thomas playing a city doctor who moves with his wife out to the country to run a private practice (have you heard this one before?) and finds out that the locals are demanding odd things from him and, when he refuses after a particularly grisly request, bad things start to get rough for him...but if I say much more, there's no point in watching it! I can only say that he should have been more suspicious of this move from the start, especially after his wife refuses to treat him like a human being after a time. All of it eventually leads to the doctor being asked to perform some strange miracles for a tribe of ""Isolates"" (which, I admit, could have gone into a more interesting place than where it eventually ends up), and ultimately cops out with a ""Rosemary's Baby""-like finish...but this Chiller Network original is a lot more incisive (at least visually) than most of the horror and thriller pictures that are coming out at the movie houses.
If there is a criticism that I must share, it is simply that networks like Chiller are coming into the trap of buying up titles and books that really are not being given enough time to gestate properly before making their entrance into the world of the airwaves (this script could have been improved upon but, to its credit--and I confess that I have not yet read Laimo's book--it is apparently a much stronger visual story than what was written in the source novel). The picture is not especially complicated (like a lot of other ""mature"" films today are trying to be) but it still seems to be using the old ""let's scare 'em"" aesthetic of the horror genre rather than trying to work towards being a genuine weird tale (on those terms, I would rather read ""The White People"" by Arthur Machen for the fifth time, or read Lovecraft's ""At the Mountains of Madness"" again). A reviewer on the Amazon website (on the NOVEL'S PAGE, not this one) known as Just InForm posted a review from abberanthology.com about the scientific implausibility inherent in Laimo's Leisure fiction novel, and I will reprint what the writer claimed below:
""...Cayle is so absurdly unbelievable a doctor that I truly believe that Laimo did absolutely no research regarding the profession of his protagonist, whatsoever...How could I possibly assert such an accusation? Well, for starters, Cayle states he has a Ph. D. Alright. But, he'd still need a M.D., which he never says he has. Also, in one of the rare moments where Cayle talks about medical procedure, he refers to administering ""a penicillin vaccine."" Unfortunately, penicillin is an antibiotic, not a vaccine - one prevents disease, the other treats them.
The most remarkable instance of Cayle's ineptitude (and evidence of Laimo's research, presumably, consisting of little more than a cursory Google search) comes during the good doctor's brilliant plan to defeat the Isolates...(SPOILER ALERT!)...Dr. Cayle injects an Isolate corpse with hantavirus, or the Hantaan virus (at one point spelled ""Haantan""'). He gives the infected corpse back to his demonic brethren and waits for the Isolates to be completely eradicated. The virus, according to Dr. Cayle, is ""highly communicable, with a near 100% death rate if not treated in time."" I'm not sure which super strain the late Dr. Farris had stowed in his fridge, but according to the CDC website ""[hantavirus] can be fatal"" but it typically ""has a mortality rate of 38%."" Even if left untreated, the mortality rate only goes as far as 50%. Furthermore, hantavirus cannot be transmitted from human to human (or from Isolate to Isolate, as Dr. Cayle comes to understand they are, at least partially). The virus rides in rodents and is transmitted through their bites, urine and saliva. The bubonic plague (of which there was a sample in the same refrigerator and can actually be transmitted through coughing or contact, not just through rodents) has a pre-antibiotic era mortality of 66%, much higher than that of hantavirus, but for some reason Cayle chose the latter. Why? Because he's a horrible, undereducated doctor and Laimo didn't bother to write him otherwise...(END SPOILERS!)...Deep in the Darkness is nothing more than a slipshod assortment of horror clich, indicative of everything bad that has been associated with horror fiction. This sort of novel is exactly what people point to when they criticize the genre, convinced that it can never ascend from its pulpy ""penny dreadful"" roots. I'm not sure who should be more ashamed that Deep in the Darkness ever saw the light of day: Laimo himself, for writing it, or Flesh & Blood Press (and later, Leisure) for publishing it..."" (END QUOTE)
Because I think that the reviewer showed exceptional perspicacity in revealing the painful lack of intelligence that has gone into the writing of modern horror and ""weird"" fiction I have decided to quote from him at length. On the Amazon page for this novel, I replied to the above quote with this response:
""Best review of a book I've read yet! It saddens me how many ""hacks"" are traversing the horror genre (really, in literary terms, we should refer to it as the ""weird"" genre) and I find that the situation for critics is also being compromised by this new, truly dreadful anything-goes approach to book publishing (I warned folks about the Internet, but no one listened to me...). I enjoy the idea of leisure fiction, don't get me wrong, but the reviewer is right in upholding the standards of actual science and medicine to these often maligned genre entries. If the writers aren't taking the books seriously, how can readers? How can editors? How can the opportunists who exist to simply look for upcoming film adaptation projects? Don't ask me. It is very insulting to readers when authors cannot bother to do simple medical research before using a doctor character in a story (I believe this guy was ""inspired"" by the TV movie 'Don't Be Afraid of the Dark' rather than a mythological kind of story, so that right there should tell you what level that he is thinking on)."" (END QUOTE)
My last remark was intended to hint at the disappointment I feel for today's writers being more influenced more by television and movies rather than other writers and was not meant to simply be a snide cut at the author for liking that 1973 TV movie because I like it as well (and I'm talking about being influenced by comic book writers, and science fiction authors, NOT great writers--even though some days I feel like reading some Thomas Hardy or an Edith Wharton novel, most days I enjoy leisure fiction works and even comic book fiction, which is where real narrative excitement resides). But I stand by the comments of Just InForm's views, because for weird tales to be effective, they are going to have to quit glossing over the scientific details. Science fiction and horror readers are supposed to be an intelligent bunch, not a pack of slough offs, and the representative film adaptations should at least make the effort to keep up with the standards of good ""pulp"" stories even. But even the movie of ""Deep in the Darkness"" glosses over the scientific details, only showing the titles upon the doctor's test tubes (such as ""bubonic plague"" and ""anti-virus"" and other nebulous labels such as those, as they erupt from the steam filled cardboard box that they arrive in, without explaining what he is doing with them), and this does not help to strengthen the credibility of a narrative. But ""Deep in the Darkness"" does have a clever scene in which the doctor looks around his home with a blue light lantern to see what traces have been left by his unwelcome home invaders...but the movie doesn't have enough profound to say about the spreading of biological hazards or human diseases to really find a practical position upon the existence of such diseases, and therefore the idea of the man being a ""doctor"" only serves to act as a counterbalance between the old theme of the man of rationality vs. the man of mythology/religion (tiresome perhaps, but not an unwelcome trope in the thriller genre).
The movie has some disgusting scenes so be prepared for those, but otherwise it's fairly straightforward for an independent television thriller movie (very brief nudity--only body, no naughty stuff) in a love scene over a sacrificial altar that turns out to be a dream, one 'f' bomb, a few minor swears (nothing major as far as language), and little actual violence surprisingly, but there is some gore and gross moments, and some nasty imagery so be warned!). It was nice to see Dean Stockwell working in the genre once again, though, and Scream Factory's audio and picture transfer is typically perfect. Yet the extras are a complete bust--a few ""Meet the Makers"" segments that are next to worthless in their lack of insights, and a few TV spots that are a bit out of place along with the original trailer--which is not that much fun, since this was not a trailer geared towards general (read: non-horror movie watchers) audiences but rather towards the Chiller network's viewers. But a lot of the movie is intense and pretty grim (almost depressing), so for a shocking experience such as it is I will give it three stars overall. C-",1430611200,4,9351,4.84865540963102

""Should we get in the running car and drive away?""
""Are you crazy? No, let's run inside the shed (that has all those chainsaws hanging)!""

I watch a lot of movies. I mean A LOT! I obviously can't be too picky if I watch that many movies because we all know the good movies to bad movies ratio isn't that high. However, if there is one thing that makes me cringe the most is the lack of common sense in a movie. I can take a slow movie. I can take a boring movie. Heck, I can even take a stupid comedy/movie. However, if a movie's main characters keep making one stupid decision only to make the next decision even more stupid, the kind you smack your own forehead and yell at the screen, ""Oh come on! Just in what universe does this make any sense?!"" then I give it a bad review. This is the kind of movie that not just bad; it makes you angry.",1436659200,12,928,4.12707182320442
