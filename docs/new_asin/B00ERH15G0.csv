5934942,1,B00ERH15G0,Sucked.....looks like it was shot with an iPhone and a desk lamp. Terrible generic music bed. Not worth your money or time.,1386028800,2,123,4.636363636363637
5934943,1,B00ERH15G0,"Not authorized by the band - didn't know that until I got it.
I can see why they didn't;  its a piece of garbage.
They don't even use PJ songs in the intros or background music.  The interviews are only to journalists or other no-names.  If you know anything remotely about this band, avoid this DVD.",1385942400,8,300,4.321428571428571
5934944,1,B00ERH15G0,I was also expecting a Concert DVD.  Nothing but useless commentary! Details don't go into detail.  Returned it & had to pay a restocking charge.  Should have just kept it as a gift!!!!,1385683200,,185,4.545454545454546
5934945,5,B00ERH15G0,"This  double DVD set is a documentary and interview  collection, featuring a 2 hour overview of PJ and a second disc - running at another 90 or so minutes -  including  filmed interviews with the group as a whole and with Eddie on his own. Both discs were much enjoyed around these parts. good price too for 2 films.",1385424000,2,316,4.305084745762712
5934946,1,B00ERH15G0,"It is renamed product previously sold as ""Under Review.""  Do not buy this if you have previous disc, it is not worth the money.",1385251200,,127,4.291666666666667
5934947,2,B00ERH15G0,I was expecting a concert DVD. Guess I didn't read the details enough because this is a documentary which is not what I wanted.,1385164800,,127,4.333333333333333
5934948,2,B00ERH15G0,This Dvd is awful. It's the same 5 guys basically bashing  pearl jam. This Dvd is not authorized by the band so i can only assume that's why you get the negative attitudes from these morons. Even when they had something decent to say about something they included insults on the band or their material. A biography is supposed to be the celebration of a band right?I totally screwed up buying this because i assumed people would talk greatly about their music. I was wrong.,1384041600,24,473,4.564705882352941
5934949,1,B00ERH15G0,"This is one of those cheesy biographical packages that has the annoying non-PJ music throughout the background while a selection of people tell the band's story.
I have seen these productions before with the Rolling Stones and Dylan..  Not good.
This 2 dvd set is not authorized by Pearl Jam and not advertised to the buyer (at least I never saw it).
It is in the dvd packaging, but that's too late when you're looking forward to an evening of Pearl Jam.

I sent it back.",1383955200,24,471,4.465116279069767
5934950,2,B00ERH15G0,"A lot of things are just awful about this.
One of the guys that is discussing the band and has ""talked"" to Jeff Ament can't even pronounce his name correctly.
Another guy discusses Kurt and Eddie how the moment of them ""slow dancing/hugging"" was not caught on camera?? Yes.. It was. Obviously these guys did not do their research. I'm only 40 minutes into the movie and I am just in awe about the lack of research the creators haven't done.
Ugh. If you're a Pear Jam fan, ""Not for You.""",1383696000,39,486,4.351648351648351

8608728,2,B00ERH15G0,"This isn't officially licensed. Nothing new or worthwhile, and I almost feel taken advantage of with this one. PJ Fan!",1401753600,,118,4.95
8608729,5,B00ERH15G0,"If you like Pearl Jam you will enjoy this DVD. It is a ""Must Have"" for every fan. It was worth the wait !!",1393286400,,106,3.4583333333333335
8608730,5,B00ERH15G0,My son loves PJ and really enjoyed this. He has watched it several times along with Pearl Jam 20 DVD.,1389139200,,101,4.1
8608731,5,B00ERH15G0,Always love some good Pearl Jam music and this DVD doesn't disappoint! It's great watching the videos and listening to the music from over the years!,1388707200,2,149,4.769230769230769
8608732,5,B00ERH15G0,"The delivey was on time. Everything was perfect!
The DVD is not as good as I expected.
It isn't a concert....is a film.  It's similar to PJ20.
I don't recomend it.",1388188800,3,163,4.258064516129032
8608733,4,B00ERH15G0,"Being a late comer to the Pearl Jam fan base, I really enjoyed this peek into the band's journey over the years.",1386633600,2,112,4.136363636363637
8608734,5,B00ERH15G0,This 2 DVD set is really informative of Pearl Jam.  Any Pearl Jam fan would love to see this 2 part set which tells the whole story behind Pearl jam along with an interview with Cameron Crowe and the group at the end of disc 2.  I still like PJ20 better!  Cameron Crowe knows how to depict each band member and others in such a way that makes you want to see it again and again.,1386115200,4,378,3.9473684210526314
