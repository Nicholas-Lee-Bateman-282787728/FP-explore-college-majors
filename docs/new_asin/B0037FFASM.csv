8390540,3,B0037FFASM,"The title and cover are misleading.  This is not action or drama packed and there is no blond captive. It goes in my small collection of old films that exploit the interest in primitive peoples and human evolution for entertainment value. Where it differs from others is that it makes a clear effort to appear scientific and includes Harvard professors and actual famous names in science.

The idea is that back then they thought Neanderthals might still be living, off in Australia. So there is a lecture on the topic in the Explorer's club and they explain their expedition to find some. Next the expedition wanders widely across the Pacific and shows detours to Hawaii, New Zealand, etc. and some dances and bare breasts to give us our money's worth and to give National Geographic a run for its money.

Eventually they do make it to Australia and then even more eventually to a very remote area. There they do find a white women who was shipwrecked way back and is married to a tribal Aborigine and is mother to his blond child. She does not want to go back with them. That is the thread of the story.

What is most interesting is how dated this is. 1931 after all. The science is bad, and the ethnography is bad. Foreign people are unselfconsciously spoken of through the eyes of white people. Women's beauty is freely commented on in terms of white standards. There is no effort to inform us about the strange customs that we see or give us insights into the thinking of the various people that we see. To put it in terms of so-called political correctness there is a lot of racism and sexism in the commentary and choice of images even though this is all supposed to be scientific. As a historical artifact I find all this to be a very interesting reminder. I think film-makers and certainly scientists have made some progress and this film can help remind us of that.

This film might bore a lot of people who do not have an historical interest in this sort of film. Maybe some people will get a laugh out of how old-fashioned it is. But it is not so over the top that I can imagine that it is a ""cult film."" The print is not good, but thankfully it exists for historical purposes.  In an ideal world there would have been a contemporary commentary to go with it. But that would be too much to expect. It is what it is.",1282435200,7,2327,4.425233644859813
