3611924,1,B001GKG3CM,I was expecting a movie about the Hollywood Elite. What I got was 83 minutes of hidden cameras on Glory Holes in Hollywood Rest stops.,1267056000,120,134,4.4
3611925,1,B001GKG3CM,"This ""movie"" was just a 60 minute webcam video of Ian Halperin touching himself to pictures of Opie and Anthony show host Anthony Cumia. Why would Amazon sell this vile garbage?",1267056000,176,177,4.741935483870968
3611926,1,B001GKG3CM,"I watched this movie on recommendation from a friend. This man just spills out junk. I feel terrible for the honest celebrity's that were given the chance to star in this movie. If it was actually a popular movie it would probably ruin their careers. Save your time and money, an avoid this like the plague.",1267056000,90,307,4.5
8305712,1,B001GKG3CM,Man I wish I can get my money back oh wait I didn't pay for this piece of s***. Ian really needs to come out of the closet before he hurts himself I'm there it's kinda dark. I'd rather cut my balls off and eat them and ask for seconds them watch this again. Your moms box.,1460073600,,272,3.789473684210526
8305713,1,B001GKG3CM,"How was something this worthless ever produced?

This movie can be used to show people what not to do, definitely a failure of Hollywood.",1423180800,,137,4.708333333333333
8305714,1,B001GKG3CM,"i wish i could give this zero stars its terrible nothing but trash, just self centered garbage.definitely would not recommend to anyone.",1371859200,4,136,5.2272727272727275
8305715,5,B001GKG3CM,"I think most of the bad reviews are from people who are jealous that they never made it with Jill Nicolini.  In fact, Ian is a dynamic personality and is able to blend into the Hollywood scene with ease, making connections along the way that frankly will have you reaching for the kleenex.  Just an intensely shocking film that will hopefully bring down a cult and change the world.

But changing the world is just one of many talents Ian Halperin possesses.  He leads us through a dark undercover world of sex, money, and murder.  You will not be able to leave your seat once you start this film, as it's that powerful.  I re-watched it another 100 times to make up for the spaces I missed when I blinked, it was that visually stunning.

If you want to hear about Ian's infiltration of Hollywood, and a little about his celebrity friends, then this is definitely for you.

But you don't have to take MY word for it...",1371859200,8,918,4.4226190476190474
8305716,1,B001GKG3CM,"When I bought this movie, I thought it would be a nice family flick to watch during the holidays.  Boy was I wrong.  The synopsis states that the movie is "" A rollicking, irreverent and controversial look behind the scenes of Hollywood.""  They could not have been more wrong.  It starts out with Ian and a young African American gent walking into a talent agent trying to pitch this awesome play that they came up with, but the talent agent is not interested.  I started thinking to myself, this sounds kinda familiar, then the talent agent asks to see the performance.  My family then looked at me in disgust as Ian and his burly friend went at it.  All I have to say about this movie is BOOOOO!  THANKS IAN!",1267401600,20,709,4.4
8305717,1,B001GKG3CM,"While ostensibly a farce, this semi-autobiographical film examines the struggles of a deeply troubled gay man and talentless would-be actor, who takes on all comers in a desperate attempt to make a name for himself in Hollywood. As a story of sexual angst and leather-clad release, it has been compared to the classic German film ""Taxi Zum Klo."" It is also the story of Halperin's long journey to overcome self-loathing over his Jewish heritage.  Ian's dream world is dominated by an SS officer named Anton, who tortures him at will, while refusing his sexual advances. I won't give away the ending, but suffice to say that redemption occurs with an explosive finish, and yes, a saxophone is involved.",1267315200,28,701,4.940677966101695
8305718,5,B001GKG3CM,"This movie rocks!  It has it all.. and by all, I mean tons of glory hole shots and extended scenes of Ian Halperin ""googling it"" if you know what I mean.",1267142400,27,153,3.935483870967742
8305719,3,B001GKG3CM,My copy was just filled with incoherent rambling about a fantasy girl named Jill and something called a 'nor ton'.  I didn't get it?,1267056000,57,132,4.5
8305720,1,B001GKG3CM,"This film, if it can even be called that, is the worst piece of filth I have ever had the displeasure of watching. Ian Halperin should be strung up and shot for creating this monstrosity. Google it.",1267056000,48,198,4.378378378378378
8305721,1,B001GKG3CM,"This movie was shot on an old 1980's camcorder. It shows one man sitting at a table with stuffed animals. Then it gets weird. He then takes the movie in another Direction. He goes about the town with a watermelon (which he has fastened a picture of one Anthony Cummia).
He takes the watermelon skating and then for a late dinner by candle light.",1267056000,68,345,4.40625
