8117789,1,B000F5WR5Q,"I guess I didn't understand or read that this wasn't a movie version. I bought for my 4yr old granddaughter.  It was a version in plays with people acting out the stories mostly.  She didn't find it interesting and I thought it would be the movies I enjoyed as a kid.
Sorry I bought it.  I'd return if we hadn't opened all of the set......
Moral of the story.........it's NOT movies",1388707200,,382,4.352112676056338
8117790,5,B000F5WR5Q,"WELL...What a delight!  What may be lacking in polish is more than made up for with heart.  AND the inspired casting of brilliant actors in supporting roles! In the six volumes I saw (3 in each box), I got to see the likes of Betty Garde, Alice Pearce, Mary Wickes, Cathleen Nesbitt, Eric Portman, Nina Foch, Joe Besser, Jack Weston, Irene Hervey, Robert Culp, Jonathan Harris, Agnes Moorehead, Jonathan Winters, Grady Sutton, Sterling Holloway, Jerry Colonna, Joseph Wiseman, Sam Jaffe, Michael Rennie, Martin Landau, Mel Blanc, Arthur Treacher, John Raitt, Imogene Coca, Arte Johnson, Barbara Pepper, and Angela Cartwright.  Many of them get to let loose and shine in ways they couldn't in other venues.  Great stories, too, some of them hilarious, touching, and even profound.  Wonderful for kids and a ton of fun for oldsters, too!",1271894400,5,835,5.065693430656935
8117791,4,B000F5WR5Q,"Three discs packed with six choice episodes from Shirley Temple's anthology series, SHIRLEY TEMPLE'S STORYBOOK (aka ""The Shirley Temple Show""). Acting as a precursor to later series like ""Faerie Tale Theatre"" and Jim Henson's ""The Storyteller"", SHIRLEY TEMPLE'S STORYBOOK was a big ratings winner for NBC. Temple hosted and also indulged in an occasional starring role, surrounded by an amazing cast of noted Broadway and Hollywood talents.

All episodes in this collection come from the 1960-61 colour season of the show.

PIPPI LONGSTOCKING (Season 2 Episode #15): Astrid Lindgren's colourful, fearless young heroine comes to life thanks to a perfectly-cast Gina Gillespie. We follow Pippi on several adventures with her neighbours Tommy (Gregory Irvin) and Annika (Kelly Smith), including a day at school where Pippi matches wits with teacher Miss Lindquist (Renie Riano), and a visit to a carnival with Tor Johnson as the strong-man!

KIM (Season 2 Episode #2): Shirley Temple must have especially loved this episode, as it was repeated several times during the run of SHIRLEY TEMPLE'S STORYBOOK. Based on the Rudyard Kipling novel, the story follows the incredible adventure of one small boy (Tony Haig) upon whose shoulders rested the entire fate of the British army. Co-starring Michael Rennie and Alan Napier.

WINNIE THE POOH (Season 2 Episode #3): The characters of A.A. Milne's Hundred Acre Wood come to thrilling life thanks to the marionettes workshopped by Bil and Cora Baird in this lovely episode, starring Shirley Temple as Mother and featuring Teddy Eccles as Christopher Robin.

BABES IN TOYLAND (Season 2 Episode #14): Originally broadcast for Christmas 1960, this adaptation of the Victor Herbert operetta is co-hosted by Shirley and her three children. Temple also takes the role of gypsy witch Floretta, with Jonathan Winters as evil Uncle Barnaby, chasing after his two young relatives (Michel Petit and Angela Cartwright), so he can steal their inheritance.

MADELINE (Season 2 Episode #5): Gina Gillespie brings to life the plucky heroine of Ludwig Bemelman's series of children's books. In an old house in Paris that's covered in vines, lived twelve little girls in two straight lines. The youngest one was Madeline... Co-starring Imogene Coca as Miss Clavel, we follow Madeline and next-door neighbour Pepito (Michel Petit) as they go in search of missing dog Genevieve, but become side-tracked by the delights of a colourful gypsy circus. Keep your eyes peeled for Ann Jillian as the oldest of the Clavel girls.

THE PRINCESS AND THE GOBLINS (Season 2 Episode #24): Shirley Temple stars as Princess Irene in this adaptation of George MacDonald's fantasy novel, about a mysterious, hidden race of goblins and the adventurous princess who discovers their plot. Co-starring Alice Pearce, Mary Wickes and Irene Hervey.",1248048000,2,2843,5.3184855233853
8117792,4,B000F5WR5Q,"I'm very pleased to report that this set (and the other ones being released) are worth the money. Each episode is well over an hour, crafted lovingly by Shirley Temple Black herself. These early forays into television belong in the same collection with Mary Martin's Peter Pan and Rogers & Hammerstein's Cinderella (either version).

Whether you're a collector interested in classic children's literature, or in Shirley Temple's career, you should own these items.

My only complaint is that the episodes are selected in a ""best of"" format, and that the extras on each disk are very light. I'd love to see more about the making of, or an introduction to each piece, but that might be asking too much. Also, so far, only episodes from the second season of the show have been released this way. (The series only aired for two seasons total.)

Looking forward to more releases over time!",1156982400,6,884,4.841059602649007
8117793,5,B000F5WR5Q,"I especially enjoyed watching WINNIE THE POOH by BIL & CORA BAIRD MARRIONETTES with 5 year old TEDDY ECCLES.  SHIRLEY is a wonderful host!  VIC MIZZY did the music and WILLIAM ASHER Produced!  The CHRISTMAS Episode of BABES IN TOYLAND was GREAT too with JONATHAN WINTERS, JOE BESSER, CARL BALLANTINE & JERRY COLONA.  There is a neat postcard included with SHIRLEY from the actual show that you can slide in the plastic on the front of the box for a better and more accurate cover too!  All in all....a GREAT set and well worth the price!",1148515200,9,537,4.552083333333333
