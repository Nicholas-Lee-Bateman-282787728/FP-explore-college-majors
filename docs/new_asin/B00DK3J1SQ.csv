5824930,2,B00DK3J1SQ,"The series is great, I love it!  My complaint is the cost of this item!  They're charging WAY too much for only 12 episodes, and that's only HALF of the series on DVD!  I would love to support the series and buy this but it is simply unreasonable...  I hope they realize that they could earn much more by making the series affordable to everyone, say $50-$60 or less for the WHOLE series,  I wouldn't care if it did not have extra's if it placed the item in my price range...  I understand that the anime industry is trying to stay in the 'black' with all the piracy going on, but the ridiculously priced dvd sets are part of the problem...",1385510400,54,640,4.24793388429752
5824931,5,B00DK3J1SQ,This is a fun anime and we didn't have to suffer through any fan service. Hope they translate more like this one.,1383091200,13,113,4.181818181818182
5824932,5,B00DK3J1SQ,Blue Exorcist is a awesome series.  I enjoyed every episode I saw.  Definitely a must see for anime fans.  Buy it for your anime collection.,1382659200,6,140,4.52
5824973,4,B00DK3J1SQ,"I would buy this series it's really good but the price tag is insane don't see how they can ask so much for half a series,i'd pay 30 or 40 but 98 is just crazy. I keep waiting for the price to drop when it does i'll get cause the show is really good has good action and story line is good",1425859200,2,288,3.661290322580645
5824974,5,B00DK3J1SQ,Best Anime yet!! But cost way to much.,1424736000,,38,3.875
5824975,1,B00DK3J1SQ,Who in the right mind is gonna pay $100 for 12 episodes?? Aniplex sucks really really bad with their pricing. They did the same thing with sword art online. Unless your Bill Gates I suggest you go online to watch it for free. It just stinks not many people will be able to buy and own this overly priced good anime,1409961600,6,314,4.163934426229508
5824976,5,B00DK3J1SQ,"I love this series both seasons were awesome. I do recommend to watch the movie it was great. I love the story line, characters, music. Perfect anime to add to my collection, though right now it is expensive so watch it on-line through animedubbed.com. highly recommend this anime:)",1408492800,2,282,4.895833333333333
5824977,5,B00DK3J1SQ,I love this series too that is the only reason i gave it 5 starts. But i have to agree. Cant they come up with a more affordable set of the seasons. Like those S.A.V.E seasons the have of some of the animes. This as well as other anime cost so much that they are currently way out of people's price range. Please try to find way to bring us this anime at a more affordable price. I for one would real like to get if that happens.,1408320000,,429,3.8863636363636362
5824978,2,B00DK3J1SQ,"Enjoyable and fun series. It's about a boy who turns out to be the son of Satan, and he gets mixxed up in all sorts of stuff trying to avenge his mentor's death by training to fight his own father.
bsolutely appalling that Aniplex feels they have to gouge fans charging $98 for HALF a series. Almost $10 per episode??? Please Aniplex, get your greedy head out of your posterior and re-release this and other series like Durarara in an affordable format! Til then, my friends and I will buy from other distributors and continue to watch Aniplex series online only.",1404604800,13,563,4.584158415841584
5824979,1,B00DK3J1SQ,"I really want to get this anime! But for some ungodly reason it cost waaaay to much! Everywhere I look, it just insanely price to high. I'm not sure it the company doing or just people want to up the price. But I can get a COMPLETE SERIES from Funimation or Save for like $20 - $65. And sometimes I can get a dvd and blu-ray combo for $60 also from Funimation. ^^""

So I guess I just going have to wait to add this amazing anime to my collection. When it is at a more reasonable price.  T-T

I did find season one on PSN for probably $35. And also Amazon Instant has both seasons about $30-ish . Which is way more avoidable. But I prefer a physical copy.  >,<

And Omg the Blu-ray version of these series is like $140 - $180 for one season. I'm a fan, but I'm not that crazy of a fan. lolz",1400457600,2,789,3.9371069182389937
5824980,4,B00DK3J1SQ,"This is a great show but for the fact that they are gouging you on the PRICE I had to knock off a half of a point(my score is 4.50) by the way I looked on rightstuf.com,that are just as high :-(. I think you have 4 options 1 pay the price(if you have the money )2 wait until they drop the price. 3. Use the amazon instant vedeo (you get the shows for a third of the price)4. If you have a game console you can buy it that way(that is what I am doing) if you do it that way it cost about $45 . But I really love the show!",1393200000,6,520,3.6106194690265485
5824981,5,B00DK3J1SQ,I completely loved every bit of the series. It had me hooked the moment I saw the first episode. i think everyone should see it. I know its pricey on this site but I think its totally worth it.. Its really great!,1390348800,7,212,4.071428571428571
5824982,3,B00DK3J1SQ,I want to get this season along with the second one but its to expensive can you please lower the price your the only people i know who have this series in English dub and i want it but its to much can you please lower it?,1389830400,29,222,3.74468085106383
8594083,5,B00DK3J1SQ,Love this anime so much. I cannot wait for the second season to be dubbed. It's a bit overpriced here though and it only comes with the first twelve episodes.,1499731200,,158,4.3
8594084,1,B00DK3J1SQ,"I cant find this full series anywhere else without it being $100 and over. This anime is spectacular but the price for just 12 episodes is unacceptable. Amazon, wake up to realize that no one will buy this at a price, or even me. Lower it to maybe $30 - $40 dollars and then people will buy it. Or just take the whole thing down. Good try but not a fair price.",1484352000,,360,4.013888888888889
8594085,1,B00DK3J1SQ,I was about to purchase this but not for that price,1467072000,,51,3.727272727272727

8594088,5,B00DK3J1SQ,I had been looking everywhere for blue exorcist. We were so excited to view the first season. Just love it,1457222400,,106,4.35
8594089,3,B00DK3J1SQ,Great series. Way too overpriced. It's free on Netflix... if you have netflix,1453075200,,77,5.0
8594090,2,B00DK3J1SQ,It's a good anime. Only problem is the outrageous price.  No anime is worth this much money come on seriously.  I would love to support them and send some money but I'm sorry the price is just too much. Bring it down to around 30$ and I'll buy it no problem.,1445731200,,258,4.03921568627451
8594091,5,B00DK3J1SQ,Arrived in good condition.  The girlfriend loved it.,1430956800,,52,5.5
8594092,1,B00DK3J1SQ,"Dear amazon, when will you get the idea that there are cookbook many fans of this series. I for one, wish I could support the show, but there are only two ways to buy them. For almost $200, the whole series, or 6 episodes for $36. COME DOWN ON THE PRICE!!!!!!!!!!!! Or if you can't do that, but the other half down for digital download.",1428278400,,336,4.184615384615385
