8469452,4,B000GCG9V6,"Well, here we had a badly aged second-generation 1/2' tape of 1981. It took about four month, in many hours the 20 year old fading video
material was digitized to the best of the source footage. It was color corrected, a green edging specifically noticed on instruments and instrument stands was removed and the dynamic of the original single channel audio enhanced and converted to stereo. There are a few audio flaws and one minor video problem near the end was covered with stills and some rolling titles. Please treat the result as a historic document. The 74 minute percussion fiesta shows Tito Puente unpolished in his best days between recording contracts and as close to the folks as he ever was.
