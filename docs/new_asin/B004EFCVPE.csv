4337040,4,B004EFCVPE,"1) This is not a beginner's video; the workout session is 50 minutes in length and utilizes some tough moves.  When the ""exerciser"" is dripping in sweat, you know it's tough.
2) Ensure that you follow Bob's instructions regarding proper form and safety and don't start with a kettlebell which is too heavy.  The video's trainer is using 15 pounds, I use 10 pounds and in the beginning it was very difficult.
3) I enjoy Bob's exericise videos....he's very clear in his instructions.  This is the same, good warm-up and cool-down included.",1297123200,11,537,4.815217391304348
4337041,4,B004EFCVPE,"I tried this workout DVD the first time last week and I was not expecting much. I don't watch a lot of tv, so didn't know who Bob Harper was - a Biggest Loser guy, so what? Then he started kicking my butt with the kettlebell. I love this workout. Some of the other commentors have said stuff like: boring set and no fakey-smiley faces. So what? Are you here to be entertained, or are you here to work the flab off your chubby behind? I'm here to work, baby. Please, Bob - make more kettlebell DVDs!!!!",1296864000,7,501,4.175257731958763
4337042,1,B004EFCVPE,"I bought this after purchasing my first kettlebell. Bob's instruction was done from a small dark room, he is far from encouraging, he makes fun of the girl demonstrating his moves because she does them wrong often. Hard to follow because the girl doing the moves can't even follow Bob. Not helpful at all, buy Jillian Micheals kettlebell video instead, she is encouraging, offers different levels, and shows you how to start with a regular weight if you aren't sure about purchasing a kettleBell. I will never buy one of BOB's videos again.",1296604800,4,540,4.817204301075269
4337043,4,B004EFCVPE,"I have 2 other Bob Harper workout DVDs and am impressed with each one. I would recommend the kettlebell workout in a heartbeat. Intense and you'll feel great afterwards. The DVD is about 50 minutes, and if you buy a Bob Harper kettle bell, there is a 30 minute DVD included. I alternate depending on time. I bought the 15 pound kettle bell and will now buy a 10 pound for the overhead clings and think I will also buy a 20 pound for the basic moves. I agree with another reviewer to not be afraid of the weight. With kettlebells you rely on momentum in most moves so you'll find the weight easier as you go. Have fun! And I hope Bob keeps making more DVDs. I like Jillian Michaels as well. Variety is what keeps me interested and moving!",1294963200,40,737,4.23404255319149
4337044,4,B004EFCVPE,"Anytime I can work up a serious sweat and pack an effective toning and cardio routine into 50 minutes spent in my living room before the kids wake up is grand.

I work out at a fairly high intensity most days of the week, and this kicked my butt. I loved it. I'm pretty new to kettlebells, but Bob has got me working and I'm hoping to see results soon. I've been pretty sore after these workouts, but in that I-worked-really-hard kind of way, not the injured sort of say.

Oh, and if you like workouts with elaborate sets and stick figures in matching hot pink workout ensembles bopping along to club music, then this is not the exercise DVD for you. If you like to work hard, get a good sweat going and move on with the rest of your day, then you'll love this.

I HIGHLY recommend you consider purchasing one of his contoured kettlebells as well. Cleans and presses have never been so comfortable. And like Bob says, don't be afraid of the heavier weights!",1294704000,56,957,4.365168539325842
4337045,5,B004EFCVPE,"I just did this DVD for the first time this morning and I really loved it.  Bob is his usual motivating and funny self.  I laughed when he said, ""If you're just standing there not doing anything you're not doing what I want you to do"" LOL.  He works out with a woman named Stephanie who is in great shape but clearly struggles during a few of the exercises.  I like that because it is a realistic portrayal of how challenging some of the moves are. He has you do something called sliders (a variation of the push-up) that I have never done before but really liked. I am new to Kettlebell workouts but am so glad I found this one.  I think it would be challenging to even a seasoned person if they used a heavier kettlebell.",1293667200,75,723,4.2101449275362315

4337047,1,B004EFCVPE,"I am a high-intermediate level exerciser.  I bought this dvd at Goodwill on sale or 97 cents.  I thought if it were too easy for me, I'd just donate it back to Goodwill.  I think this is an awful workout for beginners - it is very challenging, and not especially fun to do, which is important if you are to establish exercise in your daily life.  Bob gives almost no breaks, and keeps repeating this is a beginner's workout, and if you find it too hard, then just push yourself more.  Really?  And he names his forward lunges ""prisoner"" lunges.  That's supposed to be encouraging to someone new to exercise????  I started working out daily when I was 60 years old, and went from a size 10 to a size 2 or 4.  I get compliments almost daily on how fit and healthy I look at age 68.  I started working out with Leslie Sansone's Walk Away the Pounds series.  She is so encouraging and she was the key to my success!!  The first time I worked out to one of her dvds, I couldn't do more than 5 minutes!.  I built up little by little, never feeling discouraged, but always encouraged, because there was never the dread factor with Leslie Sansone.  Please stay away from this Bob Harper dvd if you are new to exercise!",1470268800,2,1210,4.29646017699115
4337048,5,B004EFCVPE,"Love this workout! To make it more challenging, add extra sets of the double or single arm swings when Bob pauses to talk or explain things. Also to add or decrease intensity of the workout modify the weight of your kettle bell to heavier or lighter. It's a nice workout to add into your rotation.",1469836800,,297,4.418181818181818
4337049,5,B004EFCVPE,"Great work out.  Be careful, know what you are doing before trying kettle bells.  This video does not support perfect kettle bell form so if you are an amateur, you need to be careful so you do not get injured.",1461801600,,210,4.225
4337050,4,B004EFCVPE,It seems to be about 75% lower body so that was a bit disappointing but it is a good overall workout.  I thought I was in shape but I'm still using a 10lbs. bell.,1459123200,,162,3.764705882352941

4337052,1,B004EFCVPE,Worst experience ever when I noticed that there was Pornography embedded in the DVD.  I thought I was crazy and called my husband and he was as shocked as I.  I shredded the DVD right away.,1456704000,,189,4.222222222222222

4337056,2,B004EFCVPE,"If you enjoy workouts with reliable cuing and a reasonable, consistent tempo, skip this workout.

The moves are challenging and I'd probably get good results if I kept with it, but there are other videos that are easier to follow that are just as challenging.

4337057,5,B004EFCVPE,"I have many Bob Harper DVD's. I just love them. Unlike other work out DVD's where everyone is in perfect shape, never lose balance, miscount or even sweat-Bob's DVDs show people actually following along, sweating and smiling. He is very positive and I enjoy that he offers modifications if necessary. I have already recommended him to other people and they love him too.",1454457600,,370,4.888888888888889
4337058,5,B004EFCVPE,I purchased this DVD along with his Total Body Transformation. I honestly had to laugh at the word Beginner's being used to describe this workout. This is a great tool to help you meet your weight management goals. I have ordered three more DVDs and will rotate them on my cardio days.,1453420800,,285,4.5
4337059,4,B004EFCVPE,"This is a good workout video, but I was sore, sore, sore. So for those of you who like a solid workout, this for you. It's not crossfit, but the intensity is relatively close. Besides, Bob is a big fan of crossfit. That sort of intensity is how he likes to push his workouts.

If that's not you, Jillian's workouts are still intense but on a lower level that's more amenable.",1452470400,,375,4.28169014084507

4337062,3,B004EFCVPE,"Not really a beginner workout. Bob Harper delivers a hard-core workout, no doubt. But it doesn't give you any rest periods in between. Unless you're already in good physical condition, this is not a workout for beginners.",1450051200,,221,5.0

4337065,5,B004EFCVPE,"I have done this workout countless times and really think it is great.  Don't get me wrong, it is the real deal.  I would suggest starting with a light kettle bell and working your way up.  There is even some light yoga and stretching at the end to cool down.  I usually do this on my off days from running and have noticed that it increased my run times.  A lot of this is in the hips from swinging the kettle bell.",1445644800,3,416,4.024390243902439

I would have loved to just worked out straight through without the breaks for talking and discussing form. I am sure that most people ordering a Kettlebell DVD know about form already! Just give us a DVD that does the workout and that's that, OK? Going back over to SKOGG.",1435968000,,434,4.506329113924051

4337080,5,B004EFCVPE,I wasn't sure what to expect when ordering this. Wasn't sure about the beginner level. I wanted a challenging work out that didn't take too long. It was challenging but not confusing. You can definitely make this harder with heavier weights. It is 45 min which isn't hard to finish but a little hard to fit in before work. Overall a great work out. I appreciated that the 'assistants' were working out in real time; sweating just as much as all of us! 'Trainer Bob' is motivating without being annoying or degrading. Great work out; great trainer!,1433894400,,547,4.649484536082475
4337081,5,B004EFCVPE,"So, as with most, I agree this is no beginner workout. That being said, I'm a bit peeved at sime of the comments stating and overweight person couldn't do this. I'm 220lbs and 5'9. So I'm technically classified as obese. I've been on a fitness journey since Feb, losing almost 30lbs so far. I've been doing Jillian Michaels workouts mainly but wanted to switch it up so tried this. Holy moly!! It was difficult and I wanted to quit 1/3 in and puke halfway through, but I pushed through. Don't ever put limitations on others. Our bodies are capable of amazing things and this video pushes me past my comfort zone but I'm ok with that. I love a good challenge and this is definitely challenging! Great sweat inducing, muscle shredding workout!!",1433808000,,742,4.628787878787879
4337082,2,B004EFCVPE,"I've done one other Kettle-bell workout (the Jillian Michaels one) and this one pales in comparison.  I did sweat and get my heart rate up, but I felt he took too long explaining moves.  What I prefer is either the dancer or coach to go through the movement as they explain and do it in a concise manner.  He took too much time and paused too much, leaving me wondering when he would get on to the exercise so my heart rate wouldn't drop.  He does introduce some new and interesting moves.  However, I was frustrated that 1/3rd of the exercises were non kettle-bell (i.e. push ups/jumping jacks).  I have other workout dvds that include this stuff and was looking forward to a more kettle-bell centered workout.

I really enjoyed Bob's Ripped core workout, and that led me to buy this DVD.  If you're new to kettle-bell, need more instruction and more time to recover between exercises, this might be nice.

However, if you have some experience, you like to move quickly between exercises, and/or want a primarily kettle-bell focused workout, this one might be one to avoid.",1433203200,5,1074,4.670212765957447

4337085,2,B004EFCVPE,"This workout is definitely not for beginners! I have been getting back into fitness and trying to work out more including running 3x a week and I thought I would add some excitement with this video....big mistake! I lasted about 10 minutes before I thought I was going to pass out. I have the feeling after losing at least 40lbs I should come back to this and make a second attempt but until then...i'm going to have to stick to running and eating healthy. I hope to come back and try it again after shedding some weight...but that fact alone makes the title of ""beginner's weight loss transformation"" incorrect.

It could have been a beginner's workout if time and trouble had been taken to designate one of the workout people on the dvd as the 'beginner' so they could model appropriate modifications all the way through. Luckily I know enough to incorporate my own modifications, so it's an effective workout for me - didn't waste my money.

Bob, how can I keep my abs tight when I'm waiting for the oxygen mask to drop from the ceiling and save me.  This was ridiculous.  I will admit i'm very overweight and do not like cardio ""classes.""  However, I was a gym rat for 10 years and my weight has fluctuated as much as 100 lbs. I bought this because it said bEGiNNER.  I wanted to get back into shape and knew I had to start , well, back at the beginning.  This was NO BEGINNER.  Regardless of the fact Bob keeps telling us it's a BEGINNER's workout and we should push through it.  Go hard, then go harder.  The exercisers have 0 percent body fat and look like they could run a marathon after doing the workout.  There was talk once or twice of modifying exercises/movements for the beginner, but that was only once or twice and it's all push push push.

4337141,5,B004EFCVPE,"I've worked out to many exercise DVDs: P90X, Jillian, Jackie Warner, Supreme 90 Day, and I just now started with Bob, and he is my favorite along with Jackie. To say he's tough would be an understatement. As a longtime home exerciser, I know that a major downside to using home videos long term is they can get very boring and repetitious, so it's a good idea to have many videos and maybe a few different trainers in your collection. I like the fact that his workouts are a little longer (around 50 minutes). For me, between 30 minutes to 50 minutes is my workout sweet spot: the amount of time I feel like I've worked hard, but not so long I dread even starting it (as in P90X) and not so short I feel like I didn't get in a good workout (like a few of Jillian's). Working out with Bob is no joke. He is not easier than Jillian. He makes you do a lot more reps and because his workouts are longer, I think he's tougher. I'm glad I did Jillian first and and am working out to him now that I'm more fit, instead of the reverse. I do wish this workout was customizable, but that's only a minor issue.

The kettlebells are tons of fun. They really change up a workout and strengthen your arms, back, and core in ways dumbbells and your own body weight doesn't. You can NOT substitute dumbbells for kettlebells in kettlebell workouts. They function differently and are weighted differently, so if you don't have a kettlebell, I suggest you pass on this video until you get one. I am a small woman in my mid 30s, am not very experienced with kettlebells but have worked out a long time, and I used a 10lb kettlebell, which seemed just right. If you plan on working out to kettlebells a lot, sometimes buying a set of 3 is a better value than just buying 1 at a time.",1385510400,3,1762,4.244047619047619
4337142,2,B004EFCVPE,"I gave this video 2 stars mostly because it is not a beginner workout video.  I was given this video one year ago as a gift when I was just starting to work out but, like others, felt it was too hard and perhaps dangerous for someone with relatively little to no fitness base. It was also discouraging because he kept saying the workout was for beginners but it was really just too hard.
Its one year later and I recently revisited this video. I consider myself in good shape (gym 5-6 times a week, hiking, swimming, and jogging) and this video still kicked my butt. The fitness models in the video were clearly exhausted and so was I. At this point I felt it was a good workout for me.

I would say this is a great video for someone who is already in good shape who wants a well rounded workout, but is not for people who are just starting out.",1383609600,2,845,4.177914110429448
4337143,4,B004EFCVPE,"I'm a big fan of Bob Harper and I find him a good fitness trainer. What i especially like about his workout DVD's is a diverse workout routine, a focus on 'mixing things up' which prevents hitting a plateau or just getting bored and a nicely lively soundtrack. When it comes to this particular DVD, I also definitely like the 10 minutes ab workout - when you're pressed for time or are too tired after a long day at work, a short, abs routine still helps you work on what you need and yet it's not too tiring. This particular routine is a bit too easy (the 15 minutes yoga abs on his Yoga Warrior DVD is so much cooler and demanding) but still, it's way more than regular crunches and helps you spice up your workouts.
Another upside for me is that there always seem to be both more and less advanced trainees. I'm not sure if Bob actually gives a chance to less fit people to show up on the set and show others out there that no matter what you can work out or he just makes some of his trainees look a lil less advanced. Either way, I find it both funny and kind of inspiring even though I don't need an extra dose of inspiration as I simply love a good workout a few times a week.
His male trainees in this DVD seem a lil wooden to me - dead serious faces put me off but it's a minor detail and it doesn't change the fact that i like how energetic and diverse this DVD is. I'm not sure if the title is appropriate as it may be too hard for the absolute beginners but I'm sure that everyone will find something useful here!",1383177600,2,1525,4.086666666666667

4337150,2,B004EFCVPE,"All the other reviewers are right: this is not a beginner workout. I'm not one to give bad reviews on anything, if I don't like something I'll simply not rate it, but I had to give my two cents on this one. I've done another Bob Harper workout - the Body Rev Conditioning stuff  and they are both very bad for the back! I don't know what it is, as I don't have problems with my back, however both times I did the workouts my back was killing me for days.
I work out 4-5 times a week and have been doing so for a year and a half. I've progressed to doing Insanity, P90X, Jackie Warner and Tae Bo Advanced. These workouts are upper intermediate to advanced and do not hurt my back. It's funny how an intermediate workout like Bob Haper's can do that. The moves are a bit too military and complex for the non-athletic 9 to 5 working people.
I honestly would not recommend it, there are hundreds of other good and truly beginner workouts out there - a good start would be his colleague's Jillian Michaels' 30 Day Shred, for instance, if you like her style. I also like Cindy Crawford's Next Challenge (for a bit of a vintage feel) or Davina McCall anything really (for a bit of a foreign feel, she's British).
The two stars are for the production and duration of the video (not super long, not super short) and the fact that the entire body is worked.",1378080000,5,1347,4.26171875

4337154,5,B004EFCVPE,To echo the other reviews this does not seem like a beginner workout when you are doing it but afterwards you realize that no one area was over worked.  I enjoyed the new moves especially the swimming and prisoner lunges.  I think it is best used with 2 weights (one heavier for squats and freestyle and a lighter one for butterfly).  This has more of an upper-body focus which was nice because his cardio and inside out workouts seem to focus much more on lower body.  This is a totally doable 45 minute workout but if you are out of shape I would work up to this.  He even laughs when he says it is a beginner workout because it is not.  But I can see the challenge of this quickly fading once you get into shape.  A great stepping stone.  Very modern set and good looking women as usual.  The 10-minute ab challenge was very challenging the first time I tried it.,1376352000,,866,4.263803680981595
4337155,5,B004EFCVPE,"I'm a 59 year old male, in fairly good health.  I check-out videos from the library and try them before I buy.  I have tried numerous ""beginner"" exercise videos.  A few are too easy (for 80 yrs+).  Many are too strenuous (for 30 yrs-).  Some require dance skills (for those who have all-the-moves, which I don't).  Some require great flexibility (for contortion artists, which I am not).  I purchased this one because it was almost within my range of ability and I liked it. It has a good mix of cardio, strength, and stretching at levels I can almost accomplish.  I use this video when I want a good workout and want to push myself to the limit.  I can't keep up with Bob at several points, so I just go at my own pace.  Bob has never scolded me yet.

I guess I look at this as recovery time, which is needed because he makes you work!

4337166,5,B004EFCVPE,"I am new to kettelbells, but not new to exercise. I am an avid runner who needed to incorporate weight lifting to my routine to optimize my fitness. I find weight lifting VERY boring, and more than anything, not mentally challenging (If I'm not sweating, I'm not benefiting.) I wanted a video that would keep me engaged without the cardio aspect, as I wanted to concentrate on weight lifting vs cardio, as well as keep me interested and excited to weight lift. I read a lot of reviews on different videos and thought I'd give Bob Harper a shot. I'm so glad I did. For those people who say this video is too hard, you must not be either doing the movements correct or aren't up to the fitness level that he, or obvioulsy Stephanie (the gal in the video) are, or are using too heavy of kettelbells. Certain portions of this video are challenging, others are not. That's the benefit of using different weights of kettelbells. You need to lift to your capabilities. I was challenged and engaged, as well as sore the day after. Also, after about 20 minutes into the video I started to get bored with the constant squating motion, and just when I was about to turn off the video, he switches things up and goes into upper body lifting.

4337175,5,B004EFCVPE,"I vastly preferred this to Jillian's starter video. Why? The moves were doable yet interesting and diverse enough to feel like I was doing something more akin to dance (read: fun) than moving my body repetitively to lose weight (read: drudgery). This is important because I can do the video again without rolling my eyes - it remains engaging. Also, Bob's style is refreshing - he isn't fake, overly bright or a bulldog - he is pleasant and motivating and even-tempered. I really prefer this type of atmosphere when I'm doing something that takes so much self-discipline. Remember - I'm just a beginner!",1361923200,4,603,4.864077669902913

He makes the workout fun and the girl doing it with him isn't some sort of body builder - she actually struggles towards the end which is nice to see not like other workout dvds.  He does well explaining the different moves and techniques, which I happen to find very easy to catch on.

4337177,5,B004EFCVPE,"I had to review this. It needs more. I was doing Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred until I did got a littl dull. However, she is a really good and effective trainer as well, but perhaps a bit much in the high intensity and not much variety. So I came to Bob. I still like Jillian though. Sweaty, heart-pumping and effective workout with Bob Harper from The Biggest Loser. He is really motivating to have as a trainer right in your home. Inspirational. I like his style and seem to do better with it to keep me going through my workout. Has a timer from start to finish on the bottom side of the screen, and even describing the moves as well.
 Will definitely get your heart rate up. A few motifications, though, until it can be worked up to for those who haven't worked out in awhile, anyway, and maybe especially for beginners....though it depends on exercise level. To me, mixed with low intensity and high intesnity. Even the younger, more fit people in this video are struggling. Effective nonetheless, and does the job.

I figured it wouldn't be that bad so I did the video. The video is not made for beginners at all. The only thing about beginners is that keeps saying it in the video. I've worked out a lot in my past and figured this would be good to get back into working out.

Don't get me wrong it's a great workout. I was sore and tired after working out but it's not for beginners. If it was made more for beginners it would have gotten 5 stars. Bob is one of the toughest trainers out there even though he seems so nice. He is a no excuses kind of guy and he makes it known in this video.

The video has a lot do weight training and a lot of high intensity cardio. He mixes it up. He gets your heart rate going and then does weights. Great way to get toned really quickly. Also the bonus abs was a really good workout too. I could really feel the burn.

Overall I would say the video is great but I would never wish a person doing this for their first workout. I would say this is more for intermediate or someone that hasn't worked out for a while.",1360108800,3,1198,3.962655601659751

As a person at a healthy weight that has a job involving being on their feet for 12 hours a day, this workout was HARD. I had to stop a few times and do the adjusted workouts for those that couldn't keep up. Saying that, it was a great workout.

If you are truly a beginner and are out of shape, be careful to move at a pace that is comfortable only for you and then slowly build up to the pace of the video. As for all his workout videos, they are very effective on losing weight, shaping up, and getting stronger. Bob will not be any easier on you for those who are familiar with his standard.

4337192,4,B004EFCVPE,"Let me start out by saying that I am a 25 year old 300 and something pound girl.  I ordered the Biggest Loser Weight Loss Yoga by Bob and LOVE it!  Its a very decent work out not too easy or too hard (with modifications of course).  I have been doing that dvd about 25 mins every couple of days.  And the days I don't do it, I do some light easy dancing for about 30 mins.  I have only been exercising for about 2 weeks now.  I was worried about the level of intensity for this work out because of all the other reviews stating that it was too hard and more intermediate, but it was $6 w/ shipping so how could I not get it, even if just to work up to it?  Well I finally got it, after an 8 day [ugh!] waiting period.  I put it in and began the work out.  Some moves I absolutely could not do because I get in the way of myself, but I just kept moving to keep my heart rate up.  Or I attempted it.  I bet I looked pathetic (but who cares, Im at home!)  I didn't know if I could get through the entire workout but I did.  The only one I couldn't figure out a modification for was a triceps work out where you sit on the floor with knees bent and hands on the floor behind you and then lift your self up.  Im just too heavy for that ish!  But thats near the end of the work out.  So I actually feel really good afterwards.  My thighs are just a little shaky.  And I was dripping sweat!!  I did not use any dumbbells, apparently my arms are heavy enough because I felt the burn!  It will be my goal to do this every other day (while doing my yoga on the other days) until I can do it all!  The only thing that I was disappointed about was Bobs personality didn't really shine through.  That was what I was really hoping for because it helps me in getting through the workout.  I recommend it to mobile beginners because if you have joint pain or something or just hardly ever move, it would be really rough.  And I would suggest walking, in fact I think there is a biggest loser or bob harper power walk dvd that I might buy :)",1353456000,6,2024,3.9285714285714284
4337193,5,B004EFCVPE,"I bought this video to try and jumpstart my exercise regimen. I had previously been doing some exercises at home out of the Biggest Loser books at my own pace and was feeling like a wanted to move to something else. This was EXACTLY what I needed. It is intense for me and keeps me motivated like nothing I have ever done before. No you probably won't be able to make it through the whole video without stopping the first, second, or tenth time you do it if you are a true beginner, but for me I have been able to see dramatic improvement on my ability to complete the exercises over the month I have been using this video (two to three times a week). Bob says it over and over again in the video - do the best you can and keep moving, that is all you need to do and you will get better. I think this is a great starter video for someone who hasn't worked out steadily for awhile, but is ready to start and STICK WITH something. Plus I can tell that I am building muscle! You will be sore and exhausted, but isn't that what you are going for when exercising? I would recommend taking it easy the first time though, don't use weights if you haven't worked out for awhile and ease up when you have to until you are comfortable with the exercises. Also this is a great stepping stone to get started with...I just tried Bob's ultimate cardio body video for the first time and it was incredibly hard, but I completed it, which I know would not have been possible without starting with this video first!",1350864000,2,1497,4.219512195121951

You can make modifications for beginners, but he doesn't really offer many, you just have to make up your own.

I love working out and doing the aerobic exercises also, so this was a great workout for me.  I was dripping sweat by the end and was so glad there was stretching involved... I was already feeling muscle soreness from my fitness class at the gym last night.

4337200,4,B004EFCVPE,"This DVD is not for you if you are looking for a light to moderate workout to slowly engage the muscles that have been doing nothing for months or even years. It is a pretty hard 45 minute work-out that uses body-weight type exercies to build your core strength and burn fat. You will for sure sweat and be out of breath but take it at your own pace and you will get through it and enjoy the feeling afterwards.

I find this DVD is perfect for someone who used to be active  - play sports, workout etc. - but has been in inactive for awhile (like myself). It wakes your muscle memory up fast and kick starts your body into working and feeling the way it did when you were a more active person.

Best part about this is Bob constantly keeps you on your feet. Even when he has you get down on the floor it's not long until he has you back on your feet, this is an excellent way to keep your heart rate up while building muscle.
Definitly a great DVD and worth the purchase if you are looking for a little bit quicker route back into an active lifestyle.",1345593600,,1051,4.117073170731707

I was looking for a great dvd for muscle building/stength and to get back into kettlebell.  Bob's DVD is great and definitely gets your heartbeat up but I feel like all the moves were very similar or too repetitive.  I also think after doing the DVD several times, I  definitely will be bored.  I recommend combining this DVD with other kettebell DVD's so you don't get bored or feel like you are doing the same thing over and over.  Also, you have to be careful to really pay attention to what Bob says as Stephanie, the girl in the video, sometimes doesn't have the right form or is doing a different exercise from what Bob is doing.  He does put her through a lot though so I don't blame her.  :)

Also, this is not for the faint of heart - Bob has you do mountain climbers, pushups, jumping jacks, etc., between sets - while this is great for cardio and stregth, I was really hoping for an all kettlebell workout.

4337207,5,B004EFCVPE,"I myself am female with PCOS-enhanced weight problems.  I simply adore Bob, and decided to finally try out this DVD since he's my favorite trainer on Biggest Loser.  I love the warm-ups it started with and how, as he introduces new moves, he's constantly coaching the viewer on correcting their posture and showing examples with the others working out with him.

I made it through about 25 minutes on my first viewing before I started feeling a little dizzy and decided to cool-down.  I'll be honest--it's my first intensive workout in a very long time, and I knew I was going to be feeling this one.

I felt sore and twitchy almost immediately, and later on in the day I started to get really sore.  The next day (today) it's more of a dull ache, but I'm definitely still feeling it.  I elected to use today as a rest and recover day to help my body out.

If you feel like you're going to hurt yourself (i.e. with jumping jacks or any other move you're just not quite flexible enough for yet), drop and do pushups with your knees on the floor so you're still working out.  Bob also suggests other ways to do some of the moves if you're not completely up to it just yet, like a different rendition of jumping jacks. That's what I did for some of it when I felt like I couldn't do the move they were suggesting or I could only do a few without feeling I was in danger of really hurting myself.

I'd suggest working up to the point of using weights and to not start out with them.  I decided to start with 3 pounds but I think I might skip them all together for now just to give my body a chance to keep up.

All in all, Bob gives you great framework to really get an awesome workout here, and he's so inspiring even though I know I may have shouted incoherently at the TV a couple times from exertion!  It's so important that you listen to your body and know your limitations so you don't injure yourself.  If you're a brand new baby beginner like me, make it your goal to work up to completing this DVD all at once--and I'd suggest using at least a day to recover if you feel pretty sore.

I am personally going to also purchase the Biggest Loser power walking DVD to supplement this one, so I can have some more experience building up a base strength that will help me get through this workout with fewer aches and pains!",1339632000,7,2322,4.257403189066059
4337208,4,B004EFCVPE,"I hate it when I get all excited about a work out and then end up giving up halfway through because the moves are too difficult. I am an avid fitness DVD user, but because of my less than optimal eating habits and job that entails day long sitting, I would only rate myself about a medium on the fitness scale. With this workout, which involves Bob Harper taking you through a strenuous but doable kettlebell workout, I never felt that. There were periods of less strenuous toning exercises mixed in with the more difficult cardio moves that gave me some breathing room. As in all of his workouts, Harper was a mix of tough and encouraging. The production values weren't much to look at, it looked as though Harper and the one woman he was training were in someone's basement rec room, but the workout that felt good and made me feel excited to do it again made up for the less than scintillating visuals.",1339113600,,905,4.457831325301205

I am significantly over-weight and 39 years old.  I thought I would get a beginners DVD and that I would be able to do it until I worked my way up to a ''real'' workout.  Well this is a REAL workout. I was covered in sweat and crying by the end, but I did it and I have never been so proud of myself.

You can modify some of the moves. Knee push ups or choosing not to use weights for example. But it is a challenging 48 minute workout. It shows you just how much you are capable of doing.

If you have made up your mind that it's time to get in shape, to push yourself as hard....and as far as you possibly can...buy this DVD and prove to yourself that you are committed.

At the beginning of the workout Bob asks that you give him your best.  He asks that you give him your all.  If you can do that, you can get through this and you will be so proud of yourself after.",1338249600,7,1023,3.875

In the very beginning, Bob says....""this DVD is for people who have never worked out before or someone who hasn't worked out in a long time""..or words to that effect.  Well, it's a GREAT DVD, but definitely not for beginners!  I've worked out before, but not for a year or so, and trust me, it was tough.  By the time I got to the 25 minute mark, my legs felt weak, and still do, six hours later.  At one point, Bob even laughed when he said the word ""beginners"".

I would recommend this DVD for intermediates because it's a very good workout.  I will continue to use it along with my other DVD's and look at it as a challenge.

I am giving it 4 stars because it's an awesome workout, but I didn't give it 5-Stars because word ""Beginner's"" should not be in the title.

If you're new to exercise, wait a while until you tackle this one.  I'd recommend starting out with Leslie Sansone and her ""Walking Away the Pounds"" DVD's.  They're not real intense and you'll lose weight!

UPDATE:  I had to come back today - the 'day after' - to update my review.  Be very careful with this DVD if you're not in great shape.  I am so sore today, my muscles are screaming.  Be careful!  When I recover I will attempt this again, but I will improvise at first and do the workout less intensely than Bob.",1336348800,4,1351,4.235294117647059

Now, onto the DVD itself.  Wow, I did this workout yesterday and can really feel it today!  I was always intimidated by kettle bells (I mean, the shape...), but decided to take a class at my local martial arts gym where its being offered once a week.  I kind of became obsessed, because this is a workout unlike others!  I run, I weight lift, and do some other exercise dvd's, but kettle bells is different.  You get a total body workout that you can feel the next day...in a good way, the way that you know you worked different muscles!

My class is only offered once a week so I decided to get this DVD and a small kettle bell (10 lbs, although I use a 15 lb at the gym) so that I could incorporate another day into my busy workout schedule, and I am glad I did.  Today I feel just like I do the day after my class at the gym!

I felt Bob gave great instructions to Stephanie and you could tell she was really working!  What I really liked is that I felt that they were there with me in my living room.  It was not intimidating at all, because kettle bells can be intimidating at first.  Also, I really liked that Bob did most moves with Stephanie and you could tell she was really into.  I loved that there were no obvious breaks in the DVD where they came back looking refreshed and made over, like with most of the DVD's I already own.  She was dripping in sweat at the end, and so was I.  I liked the mix of weights and cardio as well.

Obviously I love Bob Harper from The Biggest Loser, but this is my first DVD by him, and I'm seriously thinking I might look at others when my kettle bell obsession wears off.

Very enjoyable DVD.  I'm looking forward to incorporating this one weekly!",1334534400,,1836,4.2514450867052025
4337213,2,B004EFCVPE,"Let me start by saying that I am NOT a beginner.  So I can tell you with certainty that this IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS. Yes, I am shouting :) However, if you are a beginner, you can still use it if you pay close attention to what I'm about to say.

Women in particular, use no weight or 2 - 3 pound weights for the entire workout the first time you complete it.
NO MORE THAN 3 POUNDS YOUR FIRST TIME PLEASE!!!  IF YOU HAVE WORKED OUT BEFORE, NO MORE THAN 5 POUNDS!!!
Beware of the swimming and butterfly moves.  I think it's best to use NO weight for these 2 moves at first.
I recommend the above because most of the moves are done at speed so whether you have worked out before or not, some moves are too fast to maintain good form particularly for a beginner.  In addition, the excessive shoulder presses could put strain on your neck.  After the first time you do this dvd, you can figure out what weights you need and if you want to switch off for some exercises that's a good idea.

The trainer is a little annoying because he keeps calling it your first ""beginner"" workout.  It's very irritating because it's NOT technically a beginner workout.  Other than that, it can be a good workout for someone who has worked out before and will slow down some of the moves and practice good form.  It's hard to know how to do that if you have never worked out before.  It's clear that ""beginner"" doesn't necessarily mean that it's your first ever workout, but it could be for some. And remember, trainer BOB insists that it's your first beginner workout, so apparently he thinks a first timer can do it.  With this, he should have advised the use of very very light weights and had a modifier.  I gave this dvd 2 stars because it's 2012 and there should have been various options on the menu to show modifications & a little further explanation.

In summary, a beginner can do it, but do NOT use more than 3 pounds your first time.  And do NOT be discouraged if you can't do it all.  Most beginners will not be able to do the entire thing your first time.  Perhaps trainer BOB should change the name to begoners, because it's going to be intimidating to most beginners and many will probably get hurt if they don't know how to pace themselves and use proper technique.",1334275200,30,2259,4.315165876777251
4337214,3,B004EFCVPE,"Big fan of this guy and never hit the kettel bells so thought i would try this dvd to get started.
He is a good instructor so nothing wrong there. The whole studio set up however, seemed small and  cramped .The program is way too long for my needs, was hoping for some 20 minute sequences  to do in the morning before work. I think although the content i good - he knows what he is about , the total presentation comes across as being low budget.",1333584000,2,446,4.114942528735632
4337215,4,B004EFCVPE,"This is a great work out for the beginner to intermediate on kettlebells.  I'm sure someone more advanced would find it boring.  Both my husband (active duty Army) and myself do this workout, he does it with a 15lb and I do it with a 5 or 10 depending on the exercise.  I will say this is the only 50 min. DVD I own that time just flies by.  It moves at a good pace and I'm always a little surprised when the end comes.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because Bob REALLY needs to learn how to count.  On more than one exercise he says you're done when you've only done 13 of your 15 reps making one side uneven.

I will say that even after doing the workout numerous times I still find it difficult to climb stairs and sit down for the next day or so.  That tells me something is working right!",1331683200,,807,3.968944099378882
4337216,5,B004EFCVPE,"I absolutely was surprised by this video.  The exercises are vigorous and they show you quite a few modifications to use should your body not allow you to do the full range of motion.  I used a few of the modifications and did not notice any drop in my desired heart rate.  I did not have any free weights (which are requested for a few of the exercises) but even just using my body weight and gravity made an impact.  If you are careful and follow his instructions, you can feel the muscles work without the use of the weights.  Bob manages to be motivating without being saccharine, which impressed me.  I would buy this again in a heartbeat.",1330819200,2,644,4.369747899159663

4337218,5,B004EFCVPE,"I bought this DVD off the mytrainerbob website. I thought it was going to be easy, this DVD is definetly not for beginners but it is a STARTING POINT. I highly recommend this DVD for people like myself that have worked out in the past but fell off the regimen. I would suggest to start with some light weights and work yourself up. Good luck.",1329609600,,342,4.276923076923077
4337219,3,B004EFCVPE,"I have several other Bob Harper DVD's that I love, but this one isn't quite as good.

My first complaint is that in the middle of the DVD just as your working up your heart rate Bob stops and explains the clean & press for like 10 minutes...personally, I think any long explanations of form should be separated into another segment of the dvd so you don't have to interrupt the workout, this clean and press explanation really interrupts the momentum of the workout...

Secondly, Stephanie (the girl doing the workout) has horrible form, Bob even has to call her out on it a few times after a set and say ""yea actually don't do it that way, do it this way"" so if you buy this DVD make sure to watch Bob's example of form and NOT Stephanie's. She also looks like she is using a weight that is too heavy for her because you can watch her strain and wiggle to try to lift it and it even looks like she is doing it wrong and hurting herself...

Other than that if you're looking for a kettlebell DVD where you will build muscle and feel the burn this is great...just remember to watch Bob and ignore Stephanie!

only other comment would be some other reviewers said that this will give you good cardio as well as a burn, and I disagree with that...you'll sweat, but it's not from cardio there is very little cardio (if any) in this DVD...",1328227200,3,1334,4.302788844621514
4337220,4,B004EFCVPE,"I have done this DVD twice and actually enjoy it.  I like that he isn't overly bubbly or fake.  I like that the four extras are working hard and don't have time to worry about smiling.  Bob seems to kick their butts.  Like many other reviewers, the title of ""beginner"" is a bit misleading.  I bought this DVD after reading the reviews because I wanted a DVD that I could work up to.  I can do most of the 45 minute DVD, but definitely have to work up to some of his moves and don't do other parts of the DVD as fast as he does.

4337222,3,B004EFCVPE,I've only done it once.  I enjoyed it and performed it with a 10lb kettlebell.  I can see where his kettlebells may make some of the moves a bit less bruise worthy.  I felt the burn but I will say there isn't much room to modify anything.  All that's left is to go up in weight if it becomes too easy.  Also the moves felt repetitive and I can see this getting boring after a while.  Okay but I'm sure there are better out there.  I still love Bob though.,1327449600,,455,3.988888888888889
4337223,4,B004EFCVPE,"I like this DVD even though I couldn't make it passed the first 20 minutes.  Holy cow.  Bob works you out.

4337224,5,B004EFCVPE,"This is NOT a beginners workout.  Be a LITTLE in shape before you try it.  I've done lots of Jillian Micheal's DVDs and like Bob SO much more.  His attitude pushed me to keep going, and that's huge for me.  I hate working out.

He kept me guessing as to what was coming next, but all the moves were ones I could just jump in with - not ones I had to study before trying.  He had a good long warm-up and a good cooldown, which is something I don't see often in workout DVDs.

After, I feel twitchy and exhausted, like I had an awesome workout, but not like I hurt myself in the process.  I feel like I'll be able to do it again tomorrow (even though I'm sure it'll be a little harder to get through).  I would definitely recommend to anyone!",1326672000,,740,4.048275862068966

Also,""jumping"" included,which is just recipe for a beginner injury.  I think beginners should avoid this workout.",1325030400,8,502,4.5054945054945055
4337228,1,B004EFCVPE,"This is the worst kettlebell work out DVD I have ever used.

The first 25 minutes is nothing but Swing Variations and Push-Up Variations. At times I felt like Bob was making up the exercises as he went. The girl actually doing the work obviously had no idea what she was doing. There was very little rest/stretch time. There is no 'Reps' counter and Bob doesn't even give you a suggested Rep amount. He just says go and expects you to do as many as you can. There is very little isolation between muscle groups.

I could go on, but overall I got the sense that Bob had no idea what he was talking about.
Not worth it. If you want a high velocity work-out you are much better off forgetting about weights and buying Insanity.

4337229,3,B004EFCVPE,"Because Bob Harper is known for working with the morbidly obese on The Biggest Loser and the title of this workout is ""Beginner's Weight Loss"", I was so excited to find and purchase this dvd. I am 100+ lbs overweight, in my early 30's and actually I used to do crazy workouts before my weight gain but because I am now so heavy, I have serious back pain and no core strength. This workout was not impossible but dangerous for someone in my shape being that you have no one to corrrect your form. The toned,fit ppl doing this workout in the dvd looked exhausted because there is no break to catch your breath during the intervals..that meant 45 minutes of straight cardio. I am quite dissapointed in this purchase but I will say if you can work your strength up or if you have the agility then this is a great workout.(hard to do on carpet, can not do barefoot and need flexible shoes + hand weights)",1323388800,19,899,4.357142857142857
4337230,5,B004EFCVPE,"As the breakdown for the entire DVD has already been given in a previous review, I simply want to say:
Yes: This is a routine for beginners IF those beginners are committed, serious and dedicated to making a radical change happen in their body from the get-go ---because that workout is no walk in the park.
No: It is not for beginners if you have not exercised with Bob Harper before, or if you believe in exercising some minutes a day, or if walking constitutes your workout. What you'll find here is a lot of exercising against gravity (pushups, jumping, walk-outs etc.)with a constant cardio challenge.
Given that I can do the ""Pure Burn Super Strength"" by the same trainer, I thought I would do this one easily. Well... I can do it, but find it hard enough! and, as a reviewer mentioned, felt sore (back, legs and ab.)after my first two tries of the workout.
For me, this is a very good workout, and if for beginners, then again, only for ""ready to seriously change everything about my body"" beginners.
To wrap up: I thought I was no longer a beginner (doing for instance the J. Michaels ""No more trouble zones"" or  the J. Warner's ""Xtreme Time Saver Training""  with no problem (which does not mean easily), managing to complete the  B. Harper ""Pure Burn Super Strength""), but was humbled by this workout, as it did not prove non-challenging at all!",1322006400,3,1354,4.586776859504132

I'm not complaining because I bought it as a set with 3 other Bob Harper videos and I'm glad I will actually get some use out of it.

A beginner can do it with some modifications, but just beware it is challenging and will fatigue your muscles very quickly.  You don't need as much cardio endurance for it, however, it was lighter on the cardio aspect.",1321747200,2,550,4.525252525252525

I started with his Kettlebell Basics, then Kettlebell Bootcamp by Angie Miller, both with great results.  I am in fairly good shape, definitely room for improvement, but I was not prepared for the intensity in the video.  The first time I had to break it into 2 sections with a small break in between.  Even the assistant in the video was drenched in sweat and noticeably struggling.

If you're a beginner with kettlebells or just starting an exercise routine, I would caution you to wait on this purchase. If you're an intermediate (which I consider myself), go for it, but be ready to sweat and grunt.  Experts--I think you will have a suitable work out from this also.

Exercises included are the normal swings and windmills, plus standing ab workouts and a big focus on ARMS and SHOULDERS. I wish I had a lighter bell for some of these workouts, so don't pick up your heaviest one the first time out.  Also be prepared for a good amount of non-bell work, such as push ups and lateral movements.

No, the woman isn't the standard bubbly, constantly smiling, idiotic fare usually found in these kinds of DVDs. She's a million times cooler. She's doing a serious work out and has an incredible energy. Every time she yells through a rep, I'm yelling too. It's tough, and I like that we seem to be on the same level.

I have two issues with this workout.  1. the explanations for the exercises really slow down the routine.  Bob should have a tutorial first to avoid wasting time during the routines.  2. the floor exercises Stephanie does (pushups, sideways moves, clift climbing) are annoying and unnecessary.  It takes me more time to get up and down than doing the actual movements (well, I'm 63, so that's my problem.

4337239,5,B004EFCVPE,"""Bob Harper: Kettlebell Sculpted Body"" is an intense workout.  Bob works with Stephanie, who uses one (moderate to medium) weight kettlebell.  I had a 4kg (a little over 8.8 pounds) kettlebell and an 8kg (a little over 17.6 pounds) kettlebell.  Whenever I used the heavier kettlebell, the exercise was intense and my heart rate went up quite a bit and I had difficulty finishing the exercise.  Whenever I used the lighter kettlebell, I could easily do the exercise.

Warm up is about 3 minutes, 34 seconds.
Workout is about 38 minutes, 3 seconds.

I'll start with the shorter 10-Minute Beginner Abs workout.  I found it fairly easy and it was a little different from other ab workouts.  I enjoyed it and my abs were sore the next day.

The Beginner's Weight Loss Transformation, the main workout, is intense and I classify it as an intermediate workout.  Heart rate is boosted throughout most of the workout and I was sweating.  Six hours later, I was sore.  Light to moderate weights are used in slightly less than half of the exercises.  Other exercises involve plyometrics (jumping) and bodyweight exercises including various push-up variations.  I don't like jumping and I made it easier by walking and I have a piece of equipment which I use to do easier push-ups, (you could do push-ups against a wall or a bench, too).

I can see how some might say this is not a beginner's workout.  Anything that I found too hard, I just did an easier variation. We all know, that we have to be consistent and build up over time.

I liked the mix of cardio, strength, and ab work.  Bob plays with your heart rate-from medium to high to medium which makes it easier to keep up.  If something is really tough, march in place or do the beginner jumping jacks until it gets doable again.

At the moment I can do about 80% of the workout.  I've been working out to workout dvds since June.  In May I was a total couch potato.  I'm not overweight.  I'd say I'm a medium beginning exerciser.  The pushups are really difficult for me at the moment but I do what I can and keep going.

The gradual start to the workout is great.  Bob takes it nice and easy, and six minutes later you are starting to sweat.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I think the cool down is way too short-only really 3 minutes.  I would have liked more stretching at the end.

The fit twenty-somethings in the video sweat like pigs, and occasionally lose their form (though thankfully, they aren't the drama queens we see in certain other videos - no exaggerated grimacing or grunting).

I work out almost everyday, and it is a challenging workout with almost no modifications included - and no breaks - it's a solid 45 minutes, including warmup and cool-down. I cannot imagine anyone who is over 200 pounds, has joint pain, (particularly knees), or who is over 40 and beginning an exercise program or returning after years to react to this with anything other than wide-eyed amazement and swift disillusionment.

4337249,4,B004EFCVPE,"I just got this dvd after ordering it from the mytrainerbob.com websit.  I absolutely love it.  Another great workout from Bob.  This workout isn't really for your absolute beginner.  I consider myself a little advanced and felt a little challenged with this workout.  Bob keeps you moving throughout the workout; your heart will be pumping.  There are some familiar moves and a few new ones.  Really liked the ""swimming"" moves with weights.  At 45 minutes this is a good, heart pumping workout.  There's also a 10 minute ab workout that I've got to try.  Looks challenging enough.  Beginners should give it a try.  Good also for those of us looking for something different.  Definitely recommend it.",1309996800,69,700,4.931034482758621
4337250,5,B004EFCVPE,Bob Harper's workout DVDs are always a good purchase and this one didn't disappoint.  Bob walks you through the moves in his normal style - making sure that you have proper form while pushing you to your limit.,1308528000,,210,4.526315789473684
4337251,4,B004EFCVPE,I bought this dvd because when I bought Jillian's kettlebells their was only an instructional video not a workout. I find this to be difficult and have yet to make it through the whole dvd. What I have done is good but a little boring because you stay with one move so long. If you are a regular or experienced kettlebell user you may find the workout easier than I have. The instruction is good it is just beginners may not have the muscle stamina to power through for 50 minutes. It is definitely a challenge which is good though.,1307836800,,532,4.33
4337252,3,B004EFCVPE,"I bought Bob's ""Sculpted Body"" and ""Cardio Shred"" to use with ""Pure Burn Super Strength,"" which I'd been using for almost 8 weeks three times a week for my strength training workouts. I'd used a 20-lb kettlebell in my workout before that, and I wanted to try his DVDs that would let me bring it back into my routine because I loved the results I got from it. Sculpted Body and Cardio Shred both string together a good series of exercises, but at times, Bob moves too quickly between moving from one exercise to the other so that he's halfway through the exercise before I'm even in position to start it, and other times, he stops the workout to spend a lot of time explaining the technique while I'm left on hold. This was fine at first, but to have this pause every time I do this DVD is a stinker.

I've noticed that Bob's and Jillian's DVDs both incorporate overall workout length timers the same way the P90X videos do, but without P90X's mini timer set into the overall timer for each exercise. If they'd incorporated these and used them to pace the workouts, the awkward rushes or too-long pauses between exercises wouldn't happen because their timers would keep them on track.

Kettlebells are no joke. Just like with other exercises, form is everything, and I don't think Bob necessarily nails explaining the details, from helping the viewer decide how heavy a kettelebell to use to how to find the perfect hip snap stance. I'm especially nervous with his snatch instruction. It probably won't happen with the lighter weights most viewers will be using when they use this DVD, but kettlebell users have broken their arms because of bad snatch form. Instead of stopping the workout to explain form, I wish Bob had designed a workout prelude where he carefully explains how to choose and use a kettlebell.

Overall, I really enjoy both kettlebell workouts and plan to keep them in my rotation until it's time to switch my routine up again, but I'm going to find ways to ""repace"" the exercises so I'm not rushing from kettlebell swings to cliff scalers or standing around staring while he tries to explain moves.",1304985600,33,2117,4.670241286863271
4337253,5,B004EFCVPE,"I read mixed reviews about this dvd on Amazon and on Collage Video but since there are not a ton of kettlebell videos available, I went ahead and purchased. I really like this workout and Bob Harper's Kettlebell Cardio drill. I do think that they are mistitled - I get more cardio out of the Sculpted Body and more sculpting from the Cardio drill. While it is not to everyone's taste, I like the format - Bob is training just one exerciser who is not exactly perfect in form. This gives him a chance to correct her and remind the viewer of what correct form is. He has an engaging way about him. I also like the lack of musis. After doing Turbojam and Turbofire, which have excellent music, I really get annoyed with that electronic repetitive blah music that most exercise dvds use. I burn tons of calories with this workout and the time flies by. I hope he makes more kettlebell dvds.",1303603200,2,886,4.408536585365853
4337254,4,B004EFCVPE,"I just started doing kettlebell workouts because of a Jillian Michels workout on ExerciseTV which was difficult and fun.  SO I decided I needed a full workout and this definitely delivers.  I've never watched Biggest Loser so even though I knew who Bob Harper was, I wasn't aware of his training style.  The DVD delivers.  It moves you through an entire kettlebell workout and he also really focuses on form which is imperative with kettlebells.  You can really hurt yourself if you do not use proper form.  The thing with Kettlebells are that they are more than weights because swinging the bell is a cardio boost.  I was sweating after this workout and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Bonus:  Bob Harper's totally dorky laugh.  He has this goofy laugh and that was a surprise from a buff and tatooed trainer.",1302307200,,802,4.746376811594203
4337255,3,B004EFCVPE,"If you purchase this dvd you don't have to purchase Bob Harper: Kettlebell cardio shred, because he does the same exact moves.  Instead, invest you money in Jillian's ripped in 30, 4 different workouts, and she never repeats a move! You've been warned!",1301961600,15,252,4.8604651162790695
4337256,3,B004EFCVPE,"At one point when I was using this DVD, I thought to myself, ""This guy doesn't know what he's doing."" I was frustrated with the lack of accurate counting, the lack of adequate active recovery time, and repetitive nature of using two-arm swings as filler.

There are several other things wrong with this DVD.

First is the exerciser/client. Her initial form is horrendous with her back arching to do two-arm swings. If anyone is new to kettlebells, and they followed her example, they would have an injured back the next day. She is also working out with a weight that is clearly too heavy for her because by the end of the workout she is using momentum to lift it.

Second is that the director/producer/instructor doesn't follow the mirror-rule of exercise DVDs. This is a rookie mistake that many people making DVDs are guilty of. But unacceptable for someone who has been on TV for so many years. The lack of research into this small but integral detail is disappointing.

Third is that there is too much talking and a lack of clear direction. The instructor treats this DVD like an impromptu training session not a finely crafted routine that will be performed over and over.

Fourth is the lack of customer forethought. I think that encompasses the mirror-rule, the impromptu nature of the session, and the lack of accurate counting. And the instructor is also callous about an exercise that he included in the session that requires a large amount space for moving. He even jokes about hoping that the viewer has a large enough living room to perform the exercise.

Fifth is the lack of variety for lower body training. There are no figure eights, and the lunges don't incorporate moving the kettlebell at all. There is also an exercise that requires you to swing the kettlebell along your side and then switch to the other side for more swings, but there isn't a safety cue to mind your knees--ouch.

That being said there are some redeeming values to this DVD. It does give you a tough workout, and you will feel it the next day. But this should not be a beginner's introduction to kettlebell exercises.",1300060800,11,2109,4.699186991869919
4337257,5,B004EFCVPE,"I don't understand a couple of these negative reviews about this workout, but those reviews are wrong.

Let's be honest here, no matter what level you are in exercising, you have to initially start somewhere.  The great thing about this workout is that if you can only do one push up, great, keep at it because eventually you will do better as your endurance grows.  If you can only do 5 swings, keep at it because eventually you will improve as long as you keep at it.

Another reason I like this workout is because Bob is using a KETTLEBELL, not a dumbbell.  Some dumbbells can be used for some of the moves, but it does not give you the effect of the move as a kettlebell.  This workout is great on form and instruction, as Jillian Michaels workout had major issues in this area, and I have had instruction from RKC certified instructors and have used kettlebells for over 2 years consistently.

Bob works with Stephanie and he keeps the workout flowing, going.  I used a 22#, 25# kettlebell for more of a strength affect.  He incorporates body weight exercises (which are great for you in strength, total body conditioning) with the traditional kettlebell exercises.  He incorporates windmills, snatches, cleans, cleans/press, squats, swings, alternating swings, one arm swings.  All of these if done with a challenging kettlebell will sweat you death, and burn maximum calories while conditioning your body.  Also, using kettlebells works out your core/abdominal area with every swing.  You will see improvement in this area if you are consistent.  Lastly, this is a pure circuit workout which will burn the maximum calories in minimum time.

This workout is highly recommended, especially for the beginner to kettlebell workouts.  Also remember, if you want maximum results your nutrition is 50%.  Remember that, if you are not watching your diet, you will not get the results you want.  Can't keep eating that big mac and expect magical results.

4337258,5,B004EFCVPE,"I read the reviews about Bob Harper, most were positive so I bought this one. When I recieved the dvd I watch it on my computer so see what kind of workout it was. At first I did not think this is what I was looking for. I wanted a workout that was all Kettlebell.. But after a week I decided to give it a try. I really liked it I have done the workout twice now.

 It takes around 45 minutes to complete so I do it on the weekends when I have more time. I like the way Bob Harper takes the time to explain how to do the different kettlebell exercise's. I have since both a couple more of his dvd. One I have reviewed but not tryed Maybe this weekend.",1298505600,,651,3.8507462686567164
4337259,2,B004EFCVPE,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

CONS:
The first ten minutes or so was distracting.  Seemed like the exerciser was in a world of her own, starting a move without direction and continuing the same move when told to change.  After that it smoothed out.

Instructor took too much time to explain moves in the middle of the workout (especially the point with the wrist move onward) so whatever cardio you had going is lost.  Better if he broke down moves in warmup portion if they want to ensure you refresh on it every time or, better yet, as separate DVD segment.

Overall, just too much time talking (explaining, yes, and valid points perhaps) but it distracts more than it benefits the workout.  More so if you are supposed to use this DVD again and again.  Better he use that time to count and just note a few correct form points on exerciser.

Instructor notes that no trainer can count.  For me, one of the major pros of a DVD is that someone will count even reps on each side for you since I hate doing that when I'm sweating buckets.  Better yet, prefer when they count out loud or have a very basic musical beat to follow so you don't have to watch the screen the entire time.  I pretty much will not buy a DVD when some conscientious reviewer notes the reps are uneven.

At the end of the workout, the exerciser totally runs out of steam and can barely do the moves.  While I appreciate the real world aspect and the fact that I'm not struggling alone, I much prefer the exerciser keep up a steady beat for me to match (or aspire to) and push myself.

PROS:
* Really like the moves that made up the routine
* No perma-smiles

I know about the Biggest Loser but have never really watched it or this trainer. I watched the clips for this routine and liked the moves but was soso on the trainer --- my first impression turned out to be true to form.  Speaking of Biggest Loser, I'm probably the only avid DVD exerciser that is not a huge fan of Jillian (totally subjective but I do not care for her as an instructor, either.)

This was my first kettlebell DVD and it inspired me to want to buy another that would give more of what I'm looking for.  Unfortunately, it did not inspire me to buy more from this same instructor but that is a very individual preference, after all.",1297728000,6,2303,4.338785046728972
4337260,4,B004EFCVPE,"I needed a cross-training workout to supplement my running, and since I don't have time to go to a health club, I gave this a try. I was suprised and pleased to find that Bob's Kettlebell workout really does give me a great strength and cardio workout at home. I agree with other reviews, don't be afraid to move up to the heavier weights (do work up though; if you've never worked out with kettlebells or other weights, I'd take it easy at first). I do this workout 2x per week, and feel I have become a stronger runner after just 3 or 4 weeks. Bob offers a challenging workout. The only downside is I wish there was a version without the instruction and other ""first-timer"" chit-chat; after a week or two I felt I understood the ""how to"" and now I have to fast forward through the instruction. This is also my first workout with kettlebells, and I would definitely recommend these as a convenient and effective way to workout with weights at home.",1297468800,8,949,4.428571428571429

8426893,5,B004EFCVPE,"This is one of my favorite Bob Harper workouts that I've ever done.  I really generally like Bob as a trainer--he's my second favorite behind Jillian Michaels.  I find that sometimes his workouts seem a little random without rhyme or reason or they blast one part of the body while neglecting another.

This is Bob at his finest.  His workout is really well structured along with being a reasonable length (forty-five minutes).  This workout is VERY doable, but there are some part that are rather difficult, even for experienced exercisers (VERY fast walk-out pushups and very fast-paced burpees at the beginning).  This is one of Bob's most balanced workouts as well--he works out arms, shoulder, legs, butt and abs.  I'm glad he gets abs in there as well because he usually neglects them.  Cardio is nice too.  I am an intermediate exerciser and I found this to be a challenge, but as a break.  Bob's other workouts KILL ME (any of his inside out DVDs as well as his Total Body Transformation), but this one isn't a horrendous.  I only used five pounds--this is one that you could really do with eight or ten if you are looking for a challenge.

Bob's helpers actually keep up this time as opposed to other DVDs without doing anything stupid and dramatic (collapsing, screaming, being generally over-the top).  There is one editing issue at the end that always frustrated me--during the standing crunches, there's one point where the exercisers are suddenly doing the opposite leg which always threw me off.  But at the end of the day, who cares.  I also liked Bob's abs work out in this one--nice challenge!

Bob is also nice and encouraging in this DVD without being abusive or pushy.  Great DVD--I had a lot of fun doing it.",1487289600,4,1730,4.713333333333333
8426894,5,B004EFCVPE,"this is the best workout video that I have bought in a long time!  I was an avid exerciser until about 5 years ago when I had kids, got diagnosed with hypothyroidism, had knee surgery, and launched into my 40's! At a peak weight of 280 I kept trying to get back at it, but what I really enjoy is boot camp type workouts and I was having a horrible time finding one that I could even remotely keep up with, and the other ""beginner"" workouts drove me crazy with the ""if you are just learning to workout"" speeches.  This workout seems to have taken real crossfit moves but has chosen the low impact ones, and goes a slower pace.  There are a couple of places where they do jumping jacks and fast feet(3-4 minutes total of the 46 minute workout).  So I feel right at home, but can (mostly) keep up.  As always Bob gives tips on how to modify as needed, he gives the basics of what to keep in line, but he does not spend forever explaining how to do each move.  The workout is labeled as a beginner workout, but it is probably much more labeled the ""getting back into it"" workout.",1483920000,5,1075,4.194174757281553

However, a beginner video, to me, should have difficult elements. If you can do the work out on day one, it's too easy, you won't get anywhere, and you'll stop doing it in a few sessions. It should be a video that you work into.

I love this video, I'll order more of Bob's. It is a fantastic workout, very challenging when taken in total, but most of the individual movements taken separately are doable. That's why it's a good beginner vid; you can learn the routines quickly. I recommend this video to anybody that is serious about getting in shape, and/or losing weight.
