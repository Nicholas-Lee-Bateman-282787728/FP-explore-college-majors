8389560,1,B00366E1CI,"Was hoping for some instruction by Mike O'Hearn, this video just shows him working out and going through some particular lifts.  The producers of this video just hired him on as a model to demonstrate some exercises.  The whole video is narrated by someone else.  None of the content is an actual lifting routine designed by O'Hearn.  A whole lot more can be gained by avoiding this video and doing research elsewhere.",1363392000,4,418,4.763888888888889
8389561,4,B00366E1CI,"This video really works.  I've been following exactly as they said, and I notice my muscle is building incredibly fast.  They are correct to emphasize form over how much weight you are using.  I did work out when I was in college, stopped at age 27, and now am 45, so I did have a small base when I started.  I also have eaten smartly my whole life.  But following this course, I can see the muscle building quickly.  I agree that patience and good form are the keys, as well as keeping tabs on your progress.  I can see myself becoming quite developed using this workout routine.  It's an excellent course for beginners.",1329350400,2,621,4.385964912280702
8389562,4,B00366E1CI,"This DVD is aimed at persons fairly new to bodybuilding, even though some terms are not explained (e.g., compound exercises) and some topics buzz along at a supersonic pace. Content is a skimpy 32 minutes, plus a few minutes of advertisements.

The DVD spends its first seven minutes telling viewers what equipment to buy for a home gym. Some suggestions are of modest value - I am not certain every beginner needs gloves before exercising. This section is slow and will likely never be viewed a second time. The segment could have been more to the point and placed last in sequence.

The remaining 25 minutes cover a wide range of subjects: 1) How to structure a workout journal, 2) General training advice, 3) Detailed plans for whole body and split routines, 4) Meal tips and 5) Instruction on various lifts. Whew. The diet segment is just 90 seconds, but the other sections provide practical tips for you to design and manage your gym workouts.

The content is helpful to beginners, and even experienced lifters who never had instruction or want to design better workouts. The guidelines for structuring you workout log and the suggested routines are sensible. Advice on lifting technique is excellent, but rushed. The time constraints mean that each lift is allocated less than 50 seconds of instructional time. Still, I would give the 13 minutes of instruction on lifts a ****1/2 rating. The info is so good that you wish for more. It's worth noting that the advice on technique would help people who have been lifting for some time but without knowledge of the fundamentals.

Other segments are also rushed. Still, repeated viewings of the DVD will help you maximize productivity in the gym. The training advice and workout plans are great starting points.

Bottom line: Beginners would benefit from frequently watching this DVD during their first months of training. Advanced bodybuilders would probably argue with very few points, but would complain about the lack of depth in coverage since the time is so short. Production values and camera angles are excellent, even if I didn't like the repetitious and loud soundtrack. An annoying minus: There are only four bookmarks, so it is impossible to quickly navigate to instructions for particular lifts.

Recommended for the excellence of the training guidelines and instructions for various lifts. Given the quick treatment of topics, a beginning exerciser would be best served by having a good book and using the DVD as a supplementary tool for learning workout guidelines and lifting technique.",1303344000,7,2554,5.026004728132388
