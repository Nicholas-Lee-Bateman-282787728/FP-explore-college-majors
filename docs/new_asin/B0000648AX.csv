7960671,3,B0000648AX,"Dvd only has 21 scriptures in over an hours time. I expected it to be more since in it's title it said christian retreat. I think it is mostly the californian coast, so if you have his california tapes, it's some repeats. It does have a nice shot on day 2 with rays coming through the clouds that look heavenly and in day 3,  there is a shot of the sunsets reflections on the water in the shape of a cross. Also on day 2 on the scene where you are on top of a cliff looking down into the ocean, there is a swimmer who keeps getting knocked down and drug around by the surf everytime he gets up, watch for it. I am still wondering about that person. If you don't have any of these dvds, and you love the ocean, you must have one. They are relaxing, peaceful, and very realistic. I have fallen asleep to them more than once.",1123632000,,822,4.042944785276074

With His loving Words set upon the beautiful skies, and spectacular seascapes, you'll find Peace and Love in the magnificant tape. I've given it to many of my friends over Christmas and they all enjoyed it. A great gift of Love for all!",983577600,2,307,4.6
7960673,5,B0000648AX,"Soothing Scriptures is a powerful channel to experience God's gift. The Scripture quotes are well chosen and inspire the mind and spirit to marvel at God's creation. At the end of a tiring day it can provide a fitting time  to reconnect with God, oneself and nature in a  prayerful and relaxing  setting. I am grateful to Greg Voevodsky, the creator of this video, for  the many relaxing moments he has given me through this wonderful work.",956793600,5,440,4.675324675324675
7960674,5,B0000648AX,"I bought this video to share with my ill father who was going to the hospital for an operation. Watching it brought us together in a wonderful hour of relaxation and prayer.  We forget about his possible cancer and enjoyed the gorgeous beaches and the inspirational scriptures.
Before we  were both nervous and afraid... but after- we felt at peace having given  our burdens to the Lord. Thank you for this faith inspiring video.
P.S.  My father did fine and his tumor wasn't cancerous. Thanks to our renewed  faith, I am sure we'll be alright thanks to the Lord.",956361600,7,563,4.646464646464646
