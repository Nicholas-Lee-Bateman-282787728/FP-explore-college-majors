8658762,5,B00KH57UXI,"Yuuta a college student is asked to watch his three nieces while their parents are taking a trip abroad but the plane turns up missing or crashes and the girls are left parentless. The relatives get together to decide what to do with the girls and talk about breaking them up into different homes but Yuuta is not having any of that and takes them to his tiny apartment and what occurs is pretty much what you would expect the privacy concerns, financial problems, learning to live together and dealing with their loss Sora the oldest has a big crush on Yuuta Miu the middle girl is pretty mature for her age and Hina the three year old is so cute and adorable that it's almost illegal she kinda takes over the series towards the middle and I didn't mind that at all. A few of Yuuta's college friends help out here and there one is a bit of a pervert but nothing inappropriate happens he's basically comedy relief and the female college friend is a love interest but that doesn't seem to go anywhere and of course Sora is jealous of her and they have a good interaction with their neighbors and business people with one exception being the apartment manager. I really enjoyed this series a lot it's heart warming at times and can make you feel sad at times it's a very well done anime and I wish that their was more coming I would recommend this series to anyone. Their is minimal fan service here just a few bra and panty shots definitely doesn't permeate the series.",1403827200,8,1468,4.4206642066420665
