2265684,3,B00095L94W,"I enjoyed the movie very much and am glad I bought it, but at the same time was frustrated that it focused on so few of the people involved and such a small part of the whole story. I understand that the first-time director made this as a labor of love, but it wasn't clearly presented what the concept of the film was...instead, it was an attempt at a history, that ended up more as a personal portrait of the inventor.

The frustrating things that are omitted are critical history about the business errors that Bob made that nearly ruined him, his teaching career, the formation of Big Briar and the subsequent reclaimation of his trademark name for Moog synthesizers. Instead, you get Bob talking about his garden for a long time (which reminded me of ""Being There"".....people trying to read way too much into what plants he grows!)

As others have mentioned, the featured artists are a very odd mix, not representative of the musical pioneers that made the Moog synth a landmark instrument. It's cool to have Bernie Worrell, but where the heck are the mentions of influential artists like Stevie Wonder, Jan Hammer, Chick Corea, Klaus Shultz, Jean Michel jarre, Giorgio Moroder, etc, etc, etc. It's very odd to have extended performances of groups that aren't even using ANY Moog synths! And some of the Moogfest groups are OK, but not the influential groups that defined the vocabulary of the instrument.

It's too bad the filmaker didn't have a larger budget. Moog is such an important topic, that it's a shame that it wasn't more comprehensive. Perhaps Wendy Carlos and others will participate in a more complete picture of the history of this important instrument.

On the level of the film as a personal portrait, it largely succeeds. I was fortunate to know Bob a little bit from the industry and the film does a great job of capturing his spirit. It's now a particularly important film with Bob's passing, as it presents his mind and heart in a very special way that could have only been done while Bob was alive. So the decision to focus the limited resources the filmakers had on Bob's thought process turned out to be a very smart one indeed.

Well worth checking out, but just understand that it's not a very thorough history of Moog Music or of the synthesizer or of the artists that made it what it is today.",1125187200,41,2326,4.649635036496351
2265685,4,B00095L94W,"I recently discovered this outstanding documentary after hearing Bob Moog had brain cancer. He passed away yesterday (August 21st, 2005). This film is an amazing tribute to an amazing man. Without Bob Moog you can forget the existence of many of your favorite all-time albums. Pay your respects and check this documentary out!",1124668800,7,326,5.169811320754717
2265686,1,B00095L94W,"This wonderful pioneer of electronic music deserves to be praised and studied.  This documentary does neither - it consists of long, tedious diatribes by people like Rick Wakeman.  That's about it.

And how can you offer a documentary about Moog without mentioning Wendy Carlos, much less interviewing her?

Don't bother with this one.",1123027200,19,335,5.264150943396227
2265687,5,B00095L94W,"I had heard good things about this movie, but still had low expectations. By the end of the film, however, I was blown away. And not because of the live music filmed at MoogFest (although it was great). But because the heart and soul of this seemingly normal guy Bob Moog just radiated from the screen. I've been a Moog synth fan for 30 years and thought I knew a little of Moog the man. But the insight this film gives to how Moog thinks and therefore how his music machines work. I think I know the sound of a Moog better for seeing this picture. I can now hear Bob Moog's thoughts in the circuits! The machines and the man are closer than I ever imagined.",1122768000,10,658,4.188976377952756
2265688,4,B00095L94W,"I, too, initially wondered about the lack of history or context in this documentary. But as Dr. Moog wanders Tokyo and New York, you begin to realize that this is about something beyond his instruments or history: it's about the philosophy of sound and music-making, about the joy Dr. Moog and the people who have played his instruments have shared. That soul, as you trace it through present players from Stereolab to Keith Emerson, really comes across. Bits play like an ad for a Minimoog Voyager, yes, but I can think of no better snapshot of modern electronic music making. The focus around one instrument and present time is necessary to keep it from sprawling over everything. Watch it together with the Theremin documentary, which clearly influenced this film.

The director specifically refers to the Wendy Carlos incident. She refused to participate, and even threatened legal action. It's unfortunate, but I think for whatever reason she's refusing to participate in almost any history -- that's her decision, and I don't think it's specific to Mr. Fjellestad.",1121817600,12,1070,5.079545454545454
2265689,2,B00095L94W,"Finally having seen this, I'm troubled and shocked by the fact that there is no mention whatsoever to Wendy,or Walter,for that matter,Carlos in this program.
In fact Robert Moog starts the film by saying that 'Switched on Bach'  started it all,that it was the sole cultural artifact that introduced synthesis,and sinthesizers to the mass audience,and general conciousness,but he was either been shamefully edited or samelly omitted 'Switched on Bachs' creator,and mastermind ,sinthesis pioneer Wendy Carlos,by then going by the name of Walter,and obviously of another gender as well.
Whatever caused this,and appart from unwillingness of Wendy's part to colaborate,one can fairly assume the worse,only descredited the works as at least historically incorrect,and frankly,perilously bordering on revisionism. You get Rakeman instead. I pass.
P.S:R.I.P Bob Moog.",1120867200,10,860,5.88
2265690,5,B00095L94W,"As a fan of electronic music--specifically synthesizers--I have always loved the Moog synthesizer and it's analog sound. I never really knew too much about Bob Moog, the inventor of the synthesizer until I read the book ""Analog Days"" which was a detailed book on the impact of the Moog synthesizer. This Moog documentary follows not the history of electronic music, but Bob Moog's experiences and feelings thoughout his theremin/synthesizer designings. You get to hear from classic artists like Rick Wakeman and Bernie Worrell. Live footage from the NYC Moogfest is also including in the film.

The documentary was filmed on Super 18 film to give it that ""analog"" look so when when recent footage is combined with vintage footage, it gives it a connection. The documentary is about 70 minutes long and the special features are about 47 minutes long. You get to see some deleted scenes and some fantastic Moogfest performances.

Overall, the documentary is really good. If you are into electronic music and synthesizers, you will find it a very interesting film. So, I highly recommend this documentary.",1117670400,11,1102,5.116666666666666
2265691,5,B00095L94W,This documentary (released in late 2004 in theaters) is an amazing tribute to the man who brought us the synthesizer. This film has had some mixed reviews but all the negative reviews missed the point badly. This film is about Bob Moog (as opposed to his creations) and the world of music would be completely different had he not come up with his invention. The film mines Bob head for all its worth and we learn about the connections between musician and his or her instrument. A must see for all fans of documentary films and music buffs.,1117584000,12,540,4.520408163265306
2265722,5,B00095L94W,"Knowing almost nothing about analog synthesis, I got my hands on Moog's ""Little Phatty"" Synth (""LP"" for short) just recently.  The LP is said to be the last product that Robert Moog had input on and that his vision was to put the power and versaility of the Analog Synth into the hands of more people. (the Voyager is quite expensive, not to mention complex).

Well, it worked.  I picked up the ""Tribute Edition"" of the LP on eBay and was lucky enough to also get the ""Tribute"" CD and Flash feature, still shrink wrapped.

Stumbling onto the Moog movie was a direct result of the trailer that was on the CD and just about a week ago, I downloaded the movie.  I can't stop watching it.

As one reviewer put it (and I'm paraphrasing), capturing Moog and a few backstage friends on film is a priceless view into a world that we may never have known [if this movie was not produced].

Personally, I could have done with a bit less of the DJ scratchin' but it does give air time to the subculture of enthusiasts that use Moog technology for their own brand of what was once considered experimental music.

As quiet and observing as Bob Moog was said to have been (it is said that he preferred to listen to others rather than to speak about himself and his accomplishments), his manner, the stories of collaboration, and especially the clips of the good ole days, tie together a great story of how his first machines came to be.",1249862400,,1422,4.421455938697318

2265725,2,B00095L94W,"A documentary about Robert Moog, one of the most important figures in electronic music?  Yes, please, sign me up.  Alas, this premise goes awry from the outset.  This mishmash of a documentary feels like a collection of outtakes from a better work.  I don't need to see Robert Moog talking about pepper plants and Money Mark diddling around on a synthesizer.

  MOOG demonstrates that sometimes it's best to not rely on the subject of the documentary as the subject matter expert of the film.  Robert Moog is not the most well-spoken advocate and historian of his life's work.  Likewise, showing the electronic guts of his machines doesn't do much to explain how they work or why Moog's work is important to the music world.

  When utilizing archive footage, MOOG works.  Unfortunately, these moments are few and far between leaving MOOG a mumbling, muttering mess for its interminable seventy-two minutes.  Moog and electronica deserve better.",1156636800,7,945,5.0519480519480515
2265726,5,B00095L94W,"Nobody would fund this poor guy Hans Fjellestad... Wendy Carlos apparently even threatened legal action (for what he did or might do, I don't know).  Apparently nobody else had the foresight to realize that Bob Moog wouldn't live forever.  We're lucky to have this document on Bob's life, imperfect that it may be.  Mr. Fjellestad was working on an extremely limited budget, so how much can you complain when it's clear nobody else was willing to share his dream, or at least help pay for it.  Now it's too late to make anything like it again, at least with Bob himself in it.  I for one own a copy, and am grateful for it.",1153094400,18,623,4.4298245614035086
2265727,5,B00095L94W,"I enjoyed this documentary.  I've read a few of the other reviews and I guess I am confused as to what some of these viewers expected.  This is not an engineering documentary on Moog synthesizers in any regard, What we have here is a very good overview of the Man himself.  Bob Moog comes across as a very easy-natured person who was initially very interested in electrical engineering but was luckily diverted into musical audio technology.  In this video you can see him interacting with musicians and learning how they use his instruments.  He learned not just the electrical side but the artistic side of the musicians he listened to when developing ideas.  This was constant.  I am currently reading a very good documentary on Moog and this video complements it very well.  Since Moogs Passing in August of 2005, this video will shed much light on his character and his life interests.  Bob never gave the impression he wanted to be rich from the fruit of his labors, but wanted to stay inquisitive to all aspects of his life.

2265728,3,B00095L94W,"A very interesting documentary about the person Bob Moog, but I expected a more complete history, more about the full range of instruments wearing the name ""MOOG"".

Further I miss important names as Wendy Carlos, Manfred Mann and others who helped Moog to become famous around the world.

In spite of all this I'm happy that there exists a DVD to celebrate one of the most important inventors in musical history of the second half of the 20th century.",1142726400,3,451,4.69620253164557
2265729,3,B00095L94W,"I hate to criticize this DVD since I love the topic and the central character.  But, I feel that there was not enough coverage of the technology and other important contributors & collaborators.

While I enjoyed watching Dr. Moog in his garden talking about plants, I found myself wanting much more information, much more coverage of the other important people, competitors, academic activity during the time, and so many angles which seemed to be left out. It was still enjoyable, but lacking in breadth and depth.

I would recommend this DVD to anyone who knows, even vaguely, who Bob Moog was, and anyone interested in music synthesis or such history. But I agree with many of the other reviewers that this movie felt incomplete or not comprehensive.

I liked the ""mood"" and ""feel"" that the director produced here, as if he was trying to make a film that had the personality of Bob Moog, but anyone with some knowledge of this field, will get to the end and say, ""Is there a side two or something?"".

That's what I found myself doing... Looking for more information, extra scenes, etc, but there was less here than I would have liked.

I recommend it,  just don't expect it to be comprehensive or deep.",1136851200,3,1205,4.682464454976303
2265730,5,B00095L94W,"If you are at all interested in synthesizers, their impact on the music world, and how the Moog synthesizer changed history, this is a 'must have'.

I just wish I had bought my copy and had Bob autograph it before he passed away. I did go to his memorial service... a little late, I admit. But this DVD gives so much insight into the realm of the synth. There's a fair amount of footage from the 50th anniversary event ""Moogfest"" at BB King's in NYC, in May of 2004. I attended that show, and was just one table from the stage, right in front of Keith Emerson and his monster-moog. There is also some segments of Bob and Rick Wakeman back stage (It was Rick Wakeman's birthday).

Anyway- good stuff... I would buy it if I were you. I AM me, and I DID buy it, and I'm not sorry!",1127433600,7,777,4.173333333333333

8057271,5,B00095L94W,"Well worth the time spent on watching it.
You can see how this man was able to change the face of all music genre from electronic to hip-hip to prog rock by thinking outside the box. You can also see the parallels between how Robert Moog thought and how a modern dj thinks.
It also reveals that no matter what age you are in humanity in general tends to react to change the same way. Skepticism and fear on the instrument abounded, until something triggers the change and then it becomes broadly accepted if the right conditions are given. Now we hear those kind of sounds every day.

Very good jokes by Rick Wakeman.
I was a little bit let down they didn't credit Jordan Rudess who's in the back playing with Rick Wakeman at what probably was Moogfest.

What Robert Moog says at the end is the most important thing and I think is what motivates musicians to be on stage on the first place.",1359158400,,890,4.355421686746988

To be short, it's dreary and tedious. Partly because there's no organizing direction and we're left with interviews jumbled together. I kept waiting for the film to start because it felt like clips spliced together. One wonders if the interviewer ever followed up on a question he asked.
As soon as the film starts with the interview with Mr. Moog - no setup, context - that's what you're in for the whole way.
It's really for hard core Moogiacs or if you want to get a glimpse into the man. Overall, very disappointed. How it can earn 4 or 5 stars is beyond me unless the scale goes to 10.",1357948800,,829,4.314102564102564
8057273,3,B00095L94W,"Not long before his passing, Moog synthesizer co-inventor Robert Moog appeared in a documentary.

This is worthwhile to most anyone interested in electronic music.

''Moog'' (2004) shows him as a really nice guy, sort of an old 60s guy in a way, who raises his own vegetables, lectures,  and journeys the world to visit some of the illuminant exemplars (Herb Deutsch, Rick Wakeman, Keith Emerson and others) of the original synthesizer era he forged.  A native New Yorker, Moog began building and selling Theremin kits in high school - the Theremin became ''a thread'' in his life story - before heading out for a degree in electrical engineering at Columbia. In the 60s he came up with the synthesizer, in the process creating a ton of phase-lock loops, voltage controlled oscillators and other groundbreaking musical circuits.  The film doesn't dwell on these parts, but there is a lot of good gorpy and greasy feedback sound scattered in the plot.

He recalls the fear of the electronic sound that was rampant in some circles back in the 60s. The electronic sound, knock on wood, was alien and scary. It worked in commercials, however. Moog's modus recalls Ed Sanders who saw the potential for the 60s and 70s electronic synthesizers to naturally extend human poetic expression. ''Why do you feel as one with your musical instrument?'' he asks Socratic-ly at one point in ''Moog.'' Sanders similar to Moog to in his emphasis on performance. Robert Moog's quest was not about shacking up in a recording studio with electronics. It was about people creating music that people would hear in performance.",1329004800,,1603,4.962686567164179
