- The quotations are meaningful and memorable. For example, one says ""May each day be worth celebrating"". Another says ""Whatever with the past is gone, the best is yet to come.""

- The worst thing about this DVD is the video quality. I displayed it on an analog Sony 32"" TV. The picture looked blurry and grainy. The color is faded not vibrant as it should be. The beauty of the flowers is significantly reduced. This DVD is about flowers. So, the sharpness and the color are the most important. Yet, they all failed me.

It's better to borrow this disc from your local library or friend than to buy it. What a waste! It could have been a 5 stars DVD.",1346371200,,706,4.415384615384616
