8510436,5,B007549YS8,"At the height of their box office success as a comedy team, Bert Wheeler (the wavy-haired, wide-eyed innocent) & Robert Woolsey (the bespectacled, cigar-chomping wiseguy) give us 1935's ""The Rainmakers"". This comedy came at the right time in history when the public was suffering from the Great Dust Bowl Disaster; the remedy was to laugh away your troubles while poking fun at your troubles. This movie does the job. Bob & Bert play a rainmaker & his assistant who have come to provide relief to the parched & desperate community of Lima Junction, CA. Naturally, things go wrong from the very start. From the movie's zany dust storm opening (the winds stripping Bob's jalopy and lifting a house from its foundations) to one of the wildest & elaborate climactic train rides (which, I felt, goes on a tad too long), this is an extremely pleasing W&W comedy. Even Bert and regular leading lady Dorothy Lee's wooing number ""Ain't Love Grand"" rates as one of their best musical moments.
While not quite as wonderful as their classic ""Cockeyed Cavaliers"", this film is among their best!",1394841600,,1081,4.880434782608695
8510437,5,B007549YS8,"This is an underrated W & W film. It may not be a classic like Cockeyed Cavaliers, but it's a fast paced 78 minutes. It also brings Dorothy Lee back. The DVD-R transfer is from a 35mm print, and is better than the Image Ent laser disc released in the 90's. DVNR is not used. My only complaint is that the cue marks at the end of the reels are missing.",1338163200,4,351,3.9577464788732395
