7873669,5,6304494068,"I too think this video series is one of the best ever produced on WWII.  I have a very extensive video and book library, and have been converting as many of my VHS tapes to DVD as I can.  Unfortunately, Time-Life Video which produced the set
has not converted this excellent production to DVD as they recently have another outstanding series, ""Sharks of Steel"" which I just purchased.
Is anyone out there aware of the Battlefield series (12 different battles with a pair of presentations for each with a ""prelude"" to battle coupled with a second examination of the battle itself) in DVD format?  Please let me and others know.
Thank you!

7873670,5,6304494068,"The Battlefield Series are some of the best history shows I have ever seen.  I believe that three factors account for this.  Firstly, the riveting narrations of Tim-Piggot Smith give the shows an extremely erudite feel.  Secondly, the non-judgemental tone of the shows is great.  Finally, the excellent battlefield maps illustrate battles excellently.",1239753600,,351,5.566037735849057
7873671,5,6304494068,"The ""Battlefield"" series was outstanding when it first came out on PBS.  The producers concentrate on the major battles of WWII and provide a mesmerizing three-part analysis (Prelude to Battle, Battle, Aftermath) in  each video.  The Collector's set contains Stalingrad, Midway, Battle of  Britain, and Normandy.  Of the four, I learned the most from Battle of  Britain (that I didn't know already) but all were terrific.  What sets this  program apart is its proficient use of maps, which I find to be the #1  complaint I have when reading books on the same subject.  The video footage  is fantastic, taken from the actual battles, not just ""generic""  WWII combat footage.  You'll see shots here you've never seen before.  I  also liked the concise yet detailed reviews of each army's men, leadership,  weapons and strategy.  Just a first-rate job.",943574400,12,849,5.036231884057971
7873672,5,6304494068,"What made these videos so good was the orderly manner in which each of these great battles was set down in order for the viewer.  The viewer could see up front what the setting was for each battle, from relative strength  of both combatants, to the plan each of their leaders followed, to the  actual battle as it unfolded.  I was particularly impressed with the Midway  video; it almost put me in the Pacific Ocean in May/June 1942!!",912038400,8,434,4.512820512820513
