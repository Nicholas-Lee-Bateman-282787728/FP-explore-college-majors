2678386,5,B000JQ86H4,I wanted to see Alistiar Sim in something other than A Christmas Carol as Scrooge. I wish there were more with him as the Insoector,1483315200,2,131,4.28
2678387,5,B000JQ86H4,"Really old British film from the early 40's.  I love Alistair Sim is just about every role he did, but he is the star here, so it's even better.  This is a murder mystery with a lot of humor on the side.  If you know that you enjoy these B/W oldies, it's not a bad film on its own, just don't expect And Then There Was None.",1481155200,2,324,3.8059701492537314

2678390,5,B000JQ86H4,"It is the war 1944. A post man is almost dispatched by the terrible V1. He goes under surgery by a hand full of medical personnel including the surgeon, anesthesiologist, and assisting nurses. He does not survive and has been almost certainly dispatched by one of the medical entourage.

One of the best complex murder mysteries. Everything you want in a mystery. I you watch and listen closely you find the means motive and execution method of the murder. Then we though in the fact everyone looks guilty and maybe is. Each character seems to carry a secret even it does not have a direct bearing on the victoms demise.

Based on a book by Christianna Brand published in 1944 set against the background of the London Blitz. The screen play uses Inspector Cockrill (Alastair Sim) as the narrator.",1408579200,,796,4.719424460431655
2678391,4,B000JQ86H4,"Sidney Gilliat worked on the early Hitchcock films and it shows. He was at the top of his form in 1946 when he directed Green For Danger. This is a little seen film that deserves more recognition and may get it in a future release by the Criterion Collection.

Alastair Sim plays the very droll Inspector Cockrill whi has been sent out to investigate a murder at a rural English hospital during the continuous German bombing of Britain in the waning days of WWII. A postman (Moore Marriott) dies on the operating table during a seemingly minor operation. The killer is one of a group of doctors and nurses involved in the operation. The doctors (Trevor Howard and Leo Genn) have a competition going for the affection of Nurse Frederica Linley (Sally Gray) and other medical attendees also have reasons for dispatching the lead nurse who claims at a party that she can identify the killer.

Even though the film follows the routine one of the  people in this room is the killer model it never feels dated. The acting is quite good all the way around and some of the lines (penned by Gilliat and Claud Gurney from the popular novel by Christianna Brand) are marvelous after all these years. To say anymore would be to spoil the fun.

The disc that I viewed is by Nostalgia Family and offers a good transfer with decent sound. There are no extra features. For a small mystery that is over 50 years old this is quite a good package indeed.

Don't miss it.",1231027200,15,1451,4.522900763358779

8152634,5,B000JQ86H4,"Great murder mystery set in a British hospital during WWII. Not much shown in the way of hospital work...the plot unfolds in all the between-work times. It's all pretty much set at the hospital, too.  Alistair Sim is brilliant in his role as always; however, there is nothing bumbling about him this time. All other actors do a great job and will keep you guessing right to the end ""who did it?"".",1510099200,,396,4.5
