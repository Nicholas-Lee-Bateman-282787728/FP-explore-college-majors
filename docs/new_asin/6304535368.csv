7874217,5,6304535368,"Very moving episode about the truth and how hard it is when so-called ""friends"" are pressuring you to lie for them.

As his mother is struggling through her rough time, including her recent problem with the unethical Toby Russell (see the episode&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-The-Next-Generation-Episode-116-Ethics/dp/6304458746/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek - The Next Generation, Episode 116: Ethics</a>&nbsp;), Wesley Crusher is struggling with an ethical and moral issue of his own after an ""accident"" leaves one dead and the others wanting to lie and hush up the real cause of the so-called accident that killed Josh, their teammate.

It was lovely and touching to see Beverly's undying support for her son, even when Wes admits to his part in the banned scheme.  It was also just good to see dear Wesley again; I could see that Bev really missed him.

Wesley, like Beverly was with Toby Russell, is also in a vise...either continue lying to the Starfleet inquiry board and contradict what Jean Luc Picard knows and pretend Josh's death was all an ""accident""...or follow his conscience and tell the truth, even if it means Nick Locarno, who led the illegal maneuver and is now is using the ""friendship loyalty"" blackmail scheme to cover up his own lies, turns on him.

Nick so reminded me of Toby Russell, esp. when he tries to bully Wesley into going along with the lie; Toby also tried to bully Beverly into doing things her way also.  Nick has the same lack of ethics and low morals that Toby Russell has.

The similarities of the situations that both Beverly and Wesley face are startlingly similar and it illustrates how much alike Beverly and Wesley are, even though Bev is much quieter than her son.  I notice they even have similar mannerisms (slight lifting of brows when curious or questioning, for example).

It was a turning point in Wesley's life that forced him to mature in an unexpected way; he learned what true friendship was about and just how special the bond with his mom truly was.

And even though it broke Beverly's heart, she was still very proud of her son and it was so touching to see her unconditional love for him.  Unlike many other parents, who would have berated their offspring in such a situation, Beverly (who was already going through a difficult time in her own life) wisely understood that Wes had already learned from this unfortunate experience and was already growing from it.

Although Jean Luc initially dresses down Wesley and tells him that he must tell the truth, and that Nick is not a true friend if Nick expects his ""friends"" to lie for him, Jean Luc knew deep down inside that Wes would do the right thing and it was neat and nice how Jean Luc comforted Bev as she cried.

The ending was good also...Jean Luc, after Wes has tearfully confessed the truth to the inquiry board (much to Nick's indignation), wishes Wesley good luck and without a trace of condemnation or criticism, bids Wesley well and adds, *Goodbye, Cadet*.  It illustrated that Jean Luc would never, ever misuse his high ranking and leadership position, even if anyone under him does something ""wrong"" or violates regulations.

All three of them...Beverly, Wesley, and Jean Luc handled a potentially horrible situation with a beauty and dignity that took my breath away.  Kudos to all three of them.",1221782400,,3385,4.985790408525755
7874218,5,6304535368,"Well, not really, but the point is:  If you do something stupid, chances are they'll be consequences for someone.  Plot:  Wesley has joined a special team called Nova Squadron (sort of the future Blue Angels) and is involved with a deadly accident that causes the death of one other member.  Investigation is required, and things start indicating that honesty is not among these cadets.  When Capt. Picard finally stumbles upon the truth, he explains to Wesley ""The first duty""....

Overall, an excellent episode, especially with the emphasis on being honest and telling the truth, no matter what.  This episode is quite interesting in that it's kinda like a court case that is determining who is liable for the accident.  You also have to appreciate Adm. Brand.  While professional, she definitely has a warmer personality than some other admirals in Starfleet.  While Wesley is indeed sullen (this is rather unusual), you have to give him a break on this episode (as opposed to ""Journey's End"") since he would be probably depressed and in shock from his friend's death.  I also like the fact that Wesley is still responsibly-minded enough to tell the truth in the end.  Great episode",1157414400,,1185,4.959390862944162
