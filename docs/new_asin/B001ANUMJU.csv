8278249,5,B001ANUMJU,"Some of the best fiddlers around are featured on this DVD. I've had it for over a year and still can't get enough of it.
Jim VanCleve does some fantastic hard-driving stuff with some of his Mtn. Heart band members, plus Ronnie Bowman & Ron Stewart. Their version of ""Love for an Angel"" punches you in the gut. Aubrey Haynie (sometimes with Bobby Hicks and backed by Wyatt Rice, Charlie Cushman, Alan Bibey and Kent Blanton) provides the classic, smooth fiddle-tune section. Bruce Molsky's music (vocal, fiddle, and guitar all provided by him!) predates bluegrass. And Andy Leftwich shines with Cody Kilby and Byron House on modern-tinged instrumentals.
