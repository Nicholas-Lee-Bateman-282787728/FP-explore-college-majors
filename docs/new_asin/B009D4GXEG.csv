The visual representations are at best congested and would bore most young people, the presumed audience cited as ""4 and up"" in the editorial review.  The fact that this is not a true animation but action created by panning over stills further detracts from this as appropriate for younger audiences.  I was not impressed with John Candy's attempt at a New England accent, much better would have been a normal voice. Very disappointed.",1413590400,,605,4.788461538461538
