1949287,3,B0000VD11E,"The dream sequeance at the end when Justice in his mind sees the real Bandit instead of Cletus masqerading as Bandit makes no sense. How did Cletus purposely make Justice see this? It would have been better if when Justice approached Cletus he (Justice) just saw the Bandit in his own mind and then Cletus, realizing Justice is seeing him as the real Bandit, instantly plays along with it. But instead Cletus knows that Justice will see him as the real thing. How? UNeven.",1118707200,,472,4.630952380952381
1949288,3,B0000VD11E,"The original SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT (1977)was a fantastic film.  The forumla was perfect: low budget, simple script, CB radios, car chases, country music, and Hollywood stars.  There is a lot of talent in this film.  Burt Reynolds, Sally Field, Jackie Gleason, and Jerry Reed head the cast of this CB chase through the Bible-Belt.  All of these factors put SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT in league with the top grossing films of 1977.  The movie is fun to watch.  The dialogue is funny.  The soundtrack, primarily written and performed by Jerry Reed, goes along perfectly with film.  In fact, the picture's last scene hints at a sequel.

About the only drawback with the first film was its low budget.  The continuity between camera shots and scenes is lacking.  Trans Am on an interstate highway one moment -- driving on a two-lane road by a cornfield the next. Sunny blue skies in one shot and moments later confronted by an overcast threatening rain.  After watching the movie again I noted there was good reason for Burt Reynolds to wear a cowboy hat as it blocked the camera's view of vehicles in through the rear window of the Trans Am.

On the other hand, the budget kept the production honest.  The story was simple and uncomplicated.  Additionally, Jackie Gleason reportedly crafted most of his own dialogue for this movie.

Unfortunately, SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT II (1980) followed.  The only redeeming feature of this film is that the original cast was reunited.  The storyline is horrible.  Jackie Gleason's character was the only individual to show some sort of continuity between the two films.  The Bandit, we find, has become an alcoholic.  Carrie leaves Junior at the altar a second time to seek fortune with the Bandit. Cledus has apparently abandoned his family in search of truck driving adventures.  Big and Little Enos Burdette are up to their old tricks.  This time it is personal as they bribe the Bandit to smuggle a quarantined elephant from Florida to Texas.  What follows is a series of loosely connected car chases and crashups.  Burt Reynolds' crony Dom DeLuise joins the cast for seemingly no reason.  With the exception of Jerry Reed's opening song, TEXAS BOUND AND FLYING, this movie is a bomb.

The majority of BANDIT II was filmed in Florida, and it looks like Florida.  Unlike the first movie that was lensed primarily in Georgia (with additional footage shot in Ojai, California), with the exception of the desert confrontation with dozens of police cars, ala BLUES BROTHERS, the film never makes its way out of Florida.

If the film carries at all it is certainly because of Jackie Gleason's strong performance.  If you missed the nostalgic significance of Sheriff Justice driving a bus at the end of BANDIT II, go back and watch an episode or two of THE HONEYMOONERS.

It came as a surprise that SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT III made its appearance in theaters in 1983.  There was very little advertising afforded this third installment of the BANDIT series.  The main characters have been reduced to Sheriff Buford T. Justice, Junior, Cledus,  and Big and Little Enos Burdette, though Burt Reynolds also makes a cameo dream sequence appearance at the end of the film.  Even the gaudy tractor trailer was not included in this picture.

The Story:  Big and Little Enos are obsessed with the Bandit and Sheriff Justice.  As such, they contrive yet another contest to draw Justice out of retirement and into competition with the Bandit.  The Burdettes do not want to do business with the real Bandit, so Cledus decides to fill the role.

If you thought BANDIT II's elephant premise was dumb, then BANDIT III's icon is down-right stupid.  Justice and Bandit spend the entire movie stealing a plastic shark from each other.  The winner is the person who is able to deliver the life-sized fish to the Burdette ranch.  The film becomes a cliche of earlier films.  There are car chases, a bizarre speed boat chase at Silver Springs, Florida, and the usual recycled Buford T. Justice dialogue.  Jackie Gleason once again carries most of this movie.

The picture would have been better had the Bandit been cut from the film entirely.  In fact, the original concept for SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT III was for it to be a Jackie Gleason film with Gleason playing dual roles as both Smokey and the Bandit.  Note that the original cinema poster features Sherif Justice as the central character.  The original Gleason film did not fair well when shown to test audiences and the movie was altered with Jerry Reed added as the Bandit.  It is too bad that the original Gleason version of movie has yet to surface on DVD.

On the other hand, buying this set is your opportunity to acquire the original BANDIT at a price that is less than I originally paid for the solitary DVD.",1107648000,13,4772,4.7655677655677655
1949289,3,B0000VD11E,"Three stars overall, five stars for the first film, 3 stars for the second, two stars for the third and 0 stars for Universal skimping on extras.

Part of Universal's ""Franchise Collection"", this collects all 3 ""Smokey and The Bandit"" movies on one double sided DVD at a reasonable price.

I'm one of those people who don't automatically run to see a sequel of a movie that was wildly popular, especially if it was of one I enjoyed, for I'm in fear of being let down. ""Smokey and The Bandit"" was one of those movies. I let my friends see the sequels and give me their one sentence reviews. Usually they'd reply with a long drawn face and say it wasn't as good as the first one. That was good enough for me.

The first ""Smokey"" was a true classic as well as being a big money maker for Universal. The second highest grossing movie of the year 1977 (something called ""Star Wars"" was first), it was pure fun with Burt Reynolds, Sally Field, Jackie Gleason and Jerry Reed and a few chases and wrecks. It's still fun and fast paced today and has aged quite well. It's a true 70's movie though with the hairstyles, the cars, the wardrobes and CB radios. It's worth owning just for this movie.

It was with hesitation that I sat down and watched the two sequels. ""Smokey and The Bandit II"" was a bit darker especially with Burt Reynolds' character. Dom DeLuise was a good addition to the cast, the story was ok although I wasn't fond of ALL of Jackie Gleason's characters and I wasn't happy with the ending. Still, a decent follow up.

""Part 3"". Shame on Universal for trying to eke out the last bit of money from the public on this one. Jerry Reed - I think you're great, but not in this one. You were no Bandit, and that mustache. If you're a Jerry fan, try ""Concrete Cowboys"" for something a bit more fun. This was recycled scenes, recycled bits, and even recycled dialogue. The Sally Field role played by Colleen Camp was excruciatingly painful. Not even Fred the dog was around too long! Not even any songs by Jerry Reed in this one! I kept watching this movie for something good and the saving grace was being able to watch Jackie Gleason take the spotlight. And that's how I'll remember this last of the trilogy, with the Great One making one more great stand.

Kudos to Universal for the widescreen and the best available sound and for a decent price. Boo hiss to Universal for no extras (except for trailers for the first two films). I know I'll watch the first one again, and if I'm in a Jackie Gleason frame of mind, maybe the third installment. And I'm happy to be able to have some outstanding stunt work directed by Hal Needham in my collection. Now if they'd only release the soundtrack to ""Smokey and The Bandit"" on CD!",1097971200,96,2728,4.41351888667992
1949290,3,B0000VD11E,"The original film is one of my all-time favorites and is also one of the funniest films I've ever seen. The second film was a disappointing follow-up, with The Bandit turning into an embittered egomaniac and some truly silly and dumb plot twists. For example, The Great One, Jackie Gleason, playing more than one role. I personally prefer the third film to the second, despite it being universally panned by most critics. I found the third film, while not in a league with the original, to be very funny, especially given that Jackie Gleason has more screentime than in the first two films. His scenes with his son, Junior, are the best things about the film. It was also, sadly, one of Gleason's last films. The only thing I don't like is the double-sided DVD. Other than that, despite no extras whatsoever, for Jackie Gleason and Smokey fans like me, it is still a bargain and is well-worth the money.",1090281600,10,903,4.65
1949291,4,B0000VD11E,"I'm a big fan of Burt Reynolds.  I love the first Smokey and the Bandit.  The second one was pretty good too.  Not the same as the first but it still was ok.  The third one though I just didn't think it was the same since Jerry tried to be the Bandit when he fit better as the Snowman.  One thing I noticed with the pursuit pack is when Burt makes the cameo in the third Smokey and the Bandit, they cut like a couple minutes of him talking to Jackie out which in my opinion sort of ruined it.  I have the original on tape and I happened to notice it.  But, other than that even though the second and third weren't as good as the first, it still was a good idea.  I have the first and second ones on dvd seperately from before too.",1084147200,,730,3.9183673469387754
1949292,5,B0000VD11E,"I dunno why people have anything against the two sequels? All 3 of them are great movies IMO. Its a shame theirs no bonus features , apart from a couple of trailers, but i never consider them any kind of bonus.... but all 3 movies at a great price on one disc is value for money if you ask me.

You get one disc, dual side, with smokey one and two on one side, and the 3rd on the other.... i wish fans would understand that part 3 is a great Jackie Gleason movie... I guess if your only focusing on Burt Reynolds and Sally Field, then you won't enjoy them..... but for this great price, its a great deal for all 3!",1083888000,4,614,3.991869918699187
1949293,4,B0000VD11E,"I'm glad that they finally decided to release a Smokey and the Bandit 3 Pack cause it was about time when they would do it, I only wish that the movie would have more features like theatrical trailers, interviews and the deleted scenes from Smokey and the Bandit 3.
On the original Smokey and the Bandit the Enoses made a bet with the Bandit (Burt Reynolds) and Cledus (Jerry Reed) to go deliver lots of beer from Texarkana, Texas to Georgia and back within' 18 hours, I think that this movie is one of the best movies ever made and there are so many classic moments like high speed pursuits, police wrecks and good one liners from Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason), plus the Bandit falls in love with Carrie (Sally Field) and she was supposed to marry Buford T. Justice's dimwitted son Junior, the highlights of the movie is when the top of Buford's car comes off or when Junior's hat falls off and Buford tells him that he hopes that his head was in it, what a good father he is.
Now onto Smokey and the Bandit 2 the Enoses have another bet up their sleeves and they want the Bandit and Cledus to deliver the elephant from Miami to Dallas within' 3 days but unfortunately the Bandit is at a cheap motel drinking heavily cause Carrie left him and she went onto marry Junior again and she leaves Junior once again cause the Bandit needs her, plus we get to see a new character in the movie who is a Italian doctor known as Doc (Dom Deluise), but however the Bandit wasn't as a happy person like he was in the original movie cause he was acting more obnoxious and Carrie leaves the Bandit again due to his attitude, the highlight of the movie is when the semi trucks crash into the Canadian police cars or when Junior has to use the bathroom and he gets his zipper stuck, but I'm not going to tell you what happens next cause it is hilarious and I won't spoil it, overall I didn't think that it was as great as the original although it does have some good moments but it's a bit too dramatic for me in some parts.
Now we get onto the flip side of the DVD for Smokey and the Bandit 3 and I wonder why people come down really hard on that movie, I don't think that it is as good as the original but I do think that it's better than Smokey and the Bandit 2 cause the third one is funnier, I think that the people come down hard cause Burt Reynolds wasn't the Bandit in the movie (although he does have a cameo appearance) but I think that this movie is Buford T. Justice's best performance and he and his dimwitted son Junior have so many good scenes together, what surprises me about this movie is that the Enoses have more screen time than the first two movies put together.
If you love the Smokey and the Bandit movies then you should buy this Smokey and the Bandit set cause you'll be saving alot of money if you do cause this DVD set cost around $15-$20 and it's a really good value.",1080518400,17,2885,4.237749546279492

""Smokey And The Bandit 2"" released several years later was good but didn't do justice to the original. ""Smokey And The Bandit Part 3"" released in 1983, is okay, nothing great and features ""Jerry Reed"" as The Bandit. The picture quality is excellent and is the widescreen format.

I know Smokey was supposed to be the main character, but we can never seem to get enough of Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason) and his son's antics. FUNNY! FUNNY!

1950084,5,B0000VD11E,"I had planned a Smokey and the Bandit Marathon Party Night to celebrate my brother-in-law's birthday and his recent purchase of a 1977 Pontiac Trans Am, complete with black on black color scheme and bird sprawled across the hood.  The DVD arrived the day of the party.  I put the package into a gift bag along with a Red Nylon Jacket just like Burt Reynolds had.  After we had cake and ice cream, he opened his gifts.  He LOVED this DVD set.

One thing I will caution is that we were very dismayed to find that  the DVD package contained only two discs.  We thought one was missing.  The party was ruined.  Our guests were all gathered around the screen and ready for action.  We fumbled with the case.  Was there a secret compartment?  No.  After much debate we decided to start with what appeared to be Disc 2.  Much to our surprise, this disc contained BOTH movies.  The night was saved.  I was ready to call Amazon Customer support to complain but I was happy that I did not have to.",1439683200,,987,4.34065934065934

Smokey 1 & 2 are both on the first disc, but the first disc is labelled part 2.  the other disc is labeled part 3, so when I first opened it I thought the first movie had been left out of the package. From the reviews, I see that several other people had this problem.

1950214,5,B0000VD11E,I am finally leaving my review for this collection I Bought this at Wal-Mart not Amazon but this collection is awesome burt Reynolds and Jackie Gleason were amazing in the first 2 movies Jerry reed was very good as Cletus snow with Sally field role was good but like Larry from the the three stooges her job was to hold the plot together Burt Reynolds was cool and so likable as the bandit and Jackie Gleason did an amazing job as bueford t justice a small town over weight bigot sheriff from texacana Texas of course jerry reed as the snow man was good plus Jerry reed sang the song in the movie I personally like smokey and the bandit better than bullit the car chases in in smokey and the bandit were better and burt Reynolds was cooler than Steve McQueen who is a milk drinker rick harrison from pawn star's loves bullit but I feel the movie was boring and lifeless all three movies were great dispite burt Reynolds not being in the third movie other than segments smokey and the bandit 3 was funnier than the second plus the sheriff's son was a oblivious idiot but it taken great acting to be almost like jethro bodien sorry but that's who I compare junior to so in conclusion don't pay negative reviews any mind this collection is worth owning to all the people wondering my age im 33 not 70 being born 9/27/1981 I like old movies and sitcoms,1423267200,,1348,4.374501992031872

With this Franchise Collection featuring all three ""Smokies"" on one convenient disc, your problem's solved!

Smokey and the Bandit (1977) - Here it is, folks - the one that started it all. Bandit (Burt Reynolds) eventually convinces Cledus (a.k.a. ""The Snowman"") [Jerry Reed] to haul an illegal load of Coors beer across state lines from Texarkana, Texas to Atlanta, Georgia in a limited amount of time. Soon afterward, a pesky sheriff becomes involved in the chase, as Texas lawman Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason) pursues a runaway bride (Sally Field) & The Bandit. ""Smokey and the Bandit"" also co-stars Mike Henry, Paul Williams & Pat McCormick. Rating: 5 stars.

Smokey and the Bandit II (1980) - This sequel to the first movie finds Burt Reynolds reprising his role as The Bandit & Jerry Reed returning as Cledus (""The Snowman""), who find themselves involved in another race against time. The Bandit & Snowman must transport a pregnant elephant from Dallas to Miami to collect a princely sum of $400,000.00. Jackie Gleason returns as Sheriff Buford T. Justice. Also co-stars Sally Field, Paul Williams, Mike Henry, Pat McCormick & Dom DeLuise. Rating: 3 stars.

Smokey and the Bandit, Part 3 (1983) - The third & final chapter in the ""Smokey and the Bandit"" saga finds The Bandit yet again involved in another wild goose chase, as Bandit, courtesy of another bet made by the Enos brothers, transports a stuffed fish from Texas to Florida for a hefty sum. Jerry Reed steps into the role as The Bandit & Jackie Gleason returns as Sheriff Buford T. Justice. Burt Reynolds has a cameo appearance in the film. Also co-stars Paul Williams, Pat McCormick, Mike Henry & Colleen Camp. Rating: 4 stars.

All three movies are featured in Widescreen format with excellent picture & sound quality. The only downside of this disc, is there are no bonus features to accompany the three films - hence, the subtraction of one star. Otherwise, this is an excellent addition to your DVD library, especially if you're a die-hard fan of the ""Smokey and the Bandit"" movie franchise. ""SATB"" & ""SATB II"" are on one side of the disc, & ""SATB, Part 3"" is on the disc's flip side - another ingenious feature of ""Smokey and the Bandit - Pursuit Pack"". Be in hot pursuit of this title ASAP!

R.I.P., Jackie Gleason, Jerry Reed & Dom DeLuise.",1373155200,,2493,4.7482678983833715

This movie introduced me to some country music as well as the works of the actors in the series. The funny thing is.. there are sheriffs in Texas in some towns  like Buford T. Justice. The lines from this movie are quite comical and classic.

I couldn't not give this movie a 5 start review because with Smokey and the Bandit 1 and 2 how can u go wrong. but i will say this if u didn't knw there was a Smokey and the Bandit 3 there is a reason for it. its not that its a bad movie just don't get ur hopes up that its anything like the prior two.,1309132800,,570,3.7983193277310923

1950763,5,B0000VD11E,"I was 7 years old when ""Smokey and the Bandit"" hit theaters. My family went to see it at our local drive-in. As soon as the final frame hit the screen I knew two things:

1. I wanted to be a Truck Driver and use a CB Radio.
2. I would own a cool Trans-Am one day.

Now, 30 years later, I've done neither. Once I found out you actually needed to shift gears to drive a big rig....that left me out (do they even make Automatic transmission 18-wheelers??). And I guess if you squint really hard, my PT Cruiser might look like a Trans-Am....if its really dark...and foggy...and you have a lazy eye..maybe.

But that is neither here or there. What is great, is that I had basically forgotten about this Hal Needham flick until I stumbled upon ""The Pursuit Pack"" here on Amazon. You get all three ""Smokey & The Bandit"" flicks in one set under $20. Now I don't remember if I ever saw II or III (and after watching them...you'll see why they are easy to forget), but I was willing to plunk down the money just to re-watch the original once again. I was interested to see if my kids would like ""Smokey and the Bandit"" or if it would seem hopelessly dated and awful. The first film is as great as I remembered. I mean, yes, the film is dated. I don't think anyone is going to get arrested for bringing a truck load of Coors beer across state lines any longer, and while the CB Radio still exists, the national fascination with the things disappeard just as quickly as it arrived in the late 70's, but at the core of the film, ""Smokey and the Bandit"" is just a fun, car-crashing, car-jumping good time. Jackie Gleason as Sheriff Buford T. Justice steals the show. Everytime he appears on screen you will laugh, and the dynamic between Justice and his son is outrageously funny. Burt Reynolds in his heyday, and a perky Sally Field are fun to watch, as is Jerry Reed as Snowman with his Bassett Hound named Fred.
The movie just clicks right along with a great soundtrack. Plenty of cool slo-mo car crashes and stunts, and a chuckle every couple of minutes. Just a fantastic slice of 1970's fun. If you were a fan of this film 30 years ago, you will still be a fan now.

As for the two sequels included in the triple pack. Well, if you squint....on a dark night...when it's foggy...they may compare to the original film about as much as my PT Cruiser resembles the Bandit's Trans Am.",1246320000,13,2370,4.343115124153499

1950766,3,B0000VD11E,"As everyone already knows, the first Smokey and the Bandit was and is the best.  This is another of those movie series that suffer from the Tri-Affect, as I like to call it (Any after the initial release will usually be not as good or crap).  I just bought this yesterday and laughed myself silly watching the first movie.  Plenty of action in the form of car chases and crashes, and plenty of humor, mostly delivered by Jackie Gleason in one of his all time best roles.  Then I immidiatly watched Part 2.  Same premise, which is ok, except the Bandit that we all loved is no more.  Down on his luck and forgotten by the majority of his one time fans, Bandit has taken to drinking and is a wreck of a man.  And then we get to the meat of the story, about transporting an elephant to Texas.  It just wasn't as fun or engaging as the first storyline with the beer.  And all throughout the proceedings, Bandit seemed to be in a perpetual funk that never cleared up, unlike the free wheeling careless redneck cowboy from the first movie.  Even Jackie Gleason, while still being fun, isn't as good as the first movie, using many recycled jokes and put downs to Little Justice.  And then we get to the third movie, Part 3.  Burt Reynolds didn't even take part in this one, save for a brief scene at the end.  Jerry Reed played the Bandit.  I must say, however, that this movie was a lot more fun then Part 2.  Reed had grown a mustach and if not a dead ringer for Reynolds, at least looked enough like him to play the part effectively.  Heck I remember when I was a kid and saw this movie on TV, I thought it was the Real Bandit (and kept wondering why the girl called him Cleatus).  So, here we go:

Smokey and the Bandit: Two Thumbs up for fun and action that never gets old.

Smokey and the Bandit Part 2: So-So for being a giant leap from the fun and humor of the first movie to a darker take on a classic character (I didn't realize that they did this way back then. I though turning already established characters and shows darker was a modern phenomena)

Smokey and the Bandit Part 3: One Thumb up for being happier and more fun than the second movie, but just not quite capturing everything that was inherent in the first.  But that having been said, an alright way to go out for this series.",1243468800,2,2294,4.2517321016166285

The first 2 movies, Burt Reynolds drove the trans while Jerry Reed drove the truck.  The 3rd movie, Burt's not in it and Jerry drives the car while Jackie Gleason chases him.  Just not the same.

1950771,4,B0000VD11E,"I can hardly wait to recieve my SMOKEY & THE BANDIT: PURSUIT PACK DVD, especially since I loved Smokey & The Bandit I and 2 growing up back in the late 1970's and early 1980's.

I would've ordered SMOKEY & THE BANDIT PART III by itself, but for some reason, Universal never released Smokey & The Bandit 3 on DVD alone, unlike the case with Smokey & The Bandit I and Smokey & The Bandit II.

The truth is, even though Smokey & The Bandit wasn't as good as the first 2, especially since Smokey & The Bandit III had no Burt Reynolds or Sally Field in since Cletus(Jerry Reed)became the bandit in Part 3, I couldn't help being intrigued watching Smokey & The Bandit Part 3, since the Pontiac Trans-Am that they used for that sequel was the same exact Trans Am that Glen Larson and Universal used for KNIGHT RIDER, which was an '82 Pontiac Trans Am, except you get to see what KITT would've looked like if it hadn't been spruced up to look futuristic in SMOKEY & THE BANDIT III, since the Trans-Am in SMOKEY & THE BANDIT didn't have the front red scanner or the painted over Pontiac logo triangles on the hubcaps, or the fancy dashboard, etc.

So it was almost like watching a carbon copy of KITT, but without all the fancy devices and without all the spruced up features, despite the fact that SMOKEY & THE BANDIT III would've been better if Burt Reynolds and Sally Field would've co-starred in the movie along with the fact that it more than likely would've prevented SMOKEY & THE BANDIT 3 from flopping at the box office in 1983.

Additionally, I also noticed that all 3 SMOKEY & THE BANDIT movies used a different Pontiac Trans Am, since the Trans Am in SMOKEY & THE BANDIT PART 2 was newer and a little more upgraded than the Trans-Am they used in the original, plus the shape, design, and bodystyle of the Trans-Am used in Part 3 was obviously different than it was in the first 2 SMOKEY & THE BANDIT movies plus I also loved Jerry Reed's hit song ""East Bound & Down"" used in the original SMOKEY & THE BANDIT on top of that, but I like many others miss Jerry Reed dearly who passed away from emphesyma on Labor Day weekend of 2008 since Jerry Reed was a major country western legend, especially in the 70's during my childhood years of growing up in my hometown(El Centro,CA) when I was being raised in the Imperial Valley.",1219708800,5,2324,4.36027713625866
1950842,1,B0000VD11E,"The quality of this 3 movie DVD was terrible.  The first movie froze up near the end even after I attempted to play it in a second player.  The 2nd movie didn't play at all and the third one, which played perfectly, was a waste of time.
The original Smokey and the Bandit was true comedy genius and Jackie Gleason's portrayal of Sheriff Buford T. Justice was one of his very best.  Burt Reynolds, Sally Field and Jerry Reed were dynamite together and Jerry Reed's ""East Bound and Down"" song topped a great comedy. Its too bad the 2nd movie didn't play, because I thought this one was nearly as good as the first.  The 3rd installment lacked good writing and seemed just plain empty without Burt Reynolds and Sally Field.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smokey-and-the-Bandit-Pursuit-Pack/dp/B0000VD11E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smokey and the Bandit: Pursuit Pack</a>",1219276800,3,905,5.489208633093525
1950843,5,B0000VD11E,"After having seen Boogie Nights, I couldn't help but remember Burt's earlier fun filled movie, Smokey and the Bandit.  I bought this 'cause it had all three ""Smokey"" movies in it.  But only the original, Smokey and the Bandit is worth seeing in my opinion.

Smokey is about a couple of truckers that claim they can haul Coors beer across the country.  Of course they encounter problems and what fun they are!  One is a Sheriff, played by Jackie Gleason (sheriff Justice)and his son, Junior Justice (Mike Henry). Also staring is Paul Williams.  The pursuit is funny and action packed!

In a scene that had me in stiches, Jackie Gleason comes out of the men's room with toilet paper still stuck in his pants.  When I first saw this on the big screen, I was with my then fiancee, Chris and his parents.  His dad laughed so hard, loud and long we were all embarrassed and were begging him to stop---that's how funny this movie can be.  I've seen it many times after that and it still hasn't lost it's punch to me.

Chris, if you're reading this, it's still the funniest movie you've ever taken me to!

Watch this with your favorite brew and laugh your a## off!",1217721600,2,1156,4.478468899521531

The second one is likeable.  I didn't like the fact that the trailer was blue with the Bandit picture stuck on. The black rig and trailer were gone.  The Third one I haven't even finished and I don't think I have ever seen it all the way through.  But I wanted the set so this was the way to go.

I was a great Jackie Gleason fan, and thought that he should have never gone beyond the second one, and he was pushing it at that.  Old Burt and Sally knew better, i.e., when to quit.  I'll have to truthfully say that I would buy the set again, if only for the first one, and possibly the second.

The first was good...the second was...good-ish. the third...not so steller. But if you take the movies for their low budget, campy 80's clothes and humor and target audience...these three of double sided DVD was definatly worth the money. Its a guilty pleasure to sit and watch sometimes during the insomnia nights. No real extras tho, like most DVDs. No commentary - but that goes with the times and not having that technology available at the time of filming. overall - definatly worth it.",1160784000,2,660,4.64957264957265
