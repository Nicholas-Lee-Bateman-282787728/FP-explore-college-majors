7076247,5,B00V3UVCV2,An outstanding concert of Annie's latest CD Nostalgia!  The song Mood Indigo is a standout plus 4 of Annie's biggest hits acoustically presented with her playing piano.  Filmed in LA at the Orpheum theater on January 28th 2015 Annie has the solid confidence of a true artist who clearly knows herself and her audience.  I Put A Spell On You done with defiance and style. You Belong to Me with romance and grace. Enjoy this evening of Annie Lennox!,1431043200,,447,4.632911392405063
7076248,4,B00V3UVCV2,This could be so much better. Annie is great however the sound is disappointing. The DtS surround mix is lacking bass. I listened to it using the 2.0 mix and the bass was much better. This happens in many Blu-ray releases. Overall the  concert was great. It's definitely something to buy if you love Annie Lennox. I thought the cd was a better production. The video portion is very good. The solo pieces are a gem.,1430870400,,414,4.447368421052632

7076265,1,B00V3UVCV2,"Annie is a great pop and rock artist. However, her over affected prancing and posing - both vocally and physically - only highlight, rather than hide, her lack of emotional connection to these great soul, jazz and blues numbers . Even the decision to group these great and timeless members of the Great American songwriters' oeuvres under the middle-aged and MOR genre of 'nostalgia' belies the lack of conviction.",1446854400,,414,5.0144927536231885
7076266,5,B00V3UVCV2,"This lady has the best voice out there. She knows it is a powerful and classy tool and combines it with some of the most exquisite melodies and lyrics ever written.  Her range is incredible, her song selection tops, and the production of this blu ray is among the best I have ever seen. Great all the way!!!",1444521600,,307,4.293103448275862

7076280,5,B00V3UVCV2,"I was fortunate to see this concert IN PERSON at The Orpheum Theatre. Annie was mesmerizing and she definitely ""put a spell"" on the entire audience. I had to buy the Blu-Ray when it became available. I'm in a few shots too! I was center row 5. I night i'll never forget.",1436140800,,270,4.211538461538462

7076282,5,B00V3UVCV2,"If you are a fan you have to have this. I was so thrilled this came out given the fact that she did not tour.

I was delighted to see some of the cuts like ""I Cover the Waterfront"" and ""The Nearness of You"".  I found ""I Put A Spell On You"" and ""You Belong to Me"" a little lackluster but many of the tracks were just great.  ""Georgia,"" ""God Bless the Child,"" ""Memphis in June,"" ""Summertime,"" ""Strange Fruit"" and ""Mood Indigo"" all were fantastic. As a treat Annie sat next to piano and sang a few of her hits once the ""Nostalgia"" set was done but the orchestra had left. Unfortunately her hits felt a little stark but I appreciated the effort.

Thumbs up for the dvd menu option that allows a user to play the full concert, or jump back and forth from song to song while watching in case you want to see a specific song again.

I have to admit the DVD is a nice length and I appreciate it more each time I watch it.",1435708800,6,913,4.05

7076287,5,B00V3UVCV2,I've been an Annie Lenox fan for many years!  Loved this BR presentation!  Highly recommend this DVD!,1433548800,,101,4.882352941176471
7076288,5,B00V3UVCV2,So excited to have this DVD!!!  I certainly hope it won't be the last one but if it is I'm sure glad I have it!!!,1433376000,,113,3.52
7076289,2,B00V3UVCV2,"To be fair I guess I was expecting something a little different. I had not heard Annie sing in a long time and was looking forward to hearing some of her old hits. I fell asleep the first time I started watching this and shut it off the second time. I did finally make it through a viewing and this just did not work for me. The music is well done and her vocals are excellent but I found the whole thing boring and her hits that I wanted to hear came at the end and were so changed that I did not really enjoy them. This will sit in my collection, rarely ever watched.",1432944000,,569,3.9565217391304346
7076290,3,B00V3UVCV2,"The music and performance is great, but the rapid incessant jump cuts throughout the video triggered a migraine.",1432512000,3,112,5.277777777777778
7076291,5,B00V3UVCV2,"The stand-alone DVD is great. If you already have the Nostalgia CD, just buy this instead of the ""deluxe"" item.",1432339200,,111,4.6
7076292,5,B00V3UVCV2,"Many concerts have a low threshold for re-viewing, but my wife and I can watch this wonderful show over and over again.",1432080000,2,119,4.454545454545454
7076293,5,B00V3UVCV2,I am a huge fan...and have been for many years!  Awesome!,1431993600,2,57,4.181818181818182
7076294,1,B00V3UVCV2,"In the endless pilgrimage of singers to connect with the great songs of the past, here's another example of why most should abandon the effort before embarrassing themselves.  Ms. Lennox's overly-affected prancing and mannerisms, and emotionally misplaced delivery practically make fun of some of the songs in this set.  She's just not connecting with the content, and vocally doesn't have near enough range or horsepower to drive many of these songs where they are supposed to go.  Of the many blues tunes in the set, her presentation only proves that she doesn't posses the slightest inkling of talent or feel for the genre. Overall a lackluster and strangely misplaced effort.  You'd have to be a Lennox sycophant to enjoy any part of this.",1431907200,,743,5.016260162601626
7076295,5,B00V3UVCV2,No words less than MAGNIFICENT!!! So wonderful that she has graced us with this awesome performance!!,1431302400,,101,5.375
7076296,4,B00V3UVCV2,"To make a video after the music has already been released, is taking a chance.  If you are an Annie Lennox fan you will enjoy the video. I got the impression while watching the video, that it was rushed through each song to get to the end - I'm sure that there were moments that were edited out to shorten the length of the concert, I wish there was more of Annie interacting with the audience. Orchestra was spot on - would have liked to see them play the extras (Here comes the rain again / No more I love you's / Why / Sweet Dreams (Are made of this).  It is always a pleasure when Annie Lennox does her magic - making Music.",1431302400,3,628,4.056451612903226
7076297,5,B00V3UVCV2,"Annie's solo career has been a stunner for almost three decades, with series of amazing albums produced since 1990. When Nostalgia came out, I knew the show must go on! In addition to CD, she produced amazing live videos, that we so much enjoy on youtube. And finally, with PBS live show on BluRay, it was a dream come true. And the wait is over, I have my hands on this masterpiece, breathtaking musical production from the beginning to end! Annie's performance is powerful, sensitive and fragile. Her renditions of Georgia on My Mind, I Put a Spell on You and Memphis is June will take your breath away. Her voice is at her best ever, the orchestra is brilliant and the audience is lovely.
The BluRay quality is A+, both visually and audio wise. DTS 5.1 track is so powerful that my Harman Kardon home cinema was all shaky :-)

Love you Annie so much for this wonderful gift! Now, all go online and get your copy of Nostalgia!",1431216000,,928,4.458823529411765
8709013,1,B00V3UVCV2,"I like a lot of her songs, and I've really enjoyed seeing her perform on TV. However, in this set she makes each song an over-the-top demonstration of her impressive vocal skills. As a result, I didn't even enjoy some of my favorite classic songs.",1523491200,,247,4.511111111111111

8709015,4,B00V3UVCV2,"I thought I was buying a CD of her music, which I needed to copy to my pc so I could listen to it when I needed to while traveling. I was quite ditraut to get it and find out it is a DVD, and essentially useless for my needs!!",1515542400,,226,3.54
8709016,1,B00V3UVCV2,Didn't care for it at all. Will probably give it away.,1500595200,,54,4.0
8709017,1,B00V3UVCV2,"I was looking forward to this cd since I have the original Nostalgia cd and love it.  This one has four extra tracks! Wow! or so I thought.
This is the third time I am returning this cd because it will not play beyond the first track.
Such a disappointment.....

I still love Annie Lennox!!! :-)",1499472000,,295,4.25

8709020,3,B00V3UVCV2,"I really like/admire Ms Lennox, great talent, lovely voice. But I should've paid attn to the title.  This is old, boring music.  The sound quality is pretty good, not great.  The pic seems to have been fuzzed intentionally-perhaps for artistic effect???",1469750400,,253,5.121951219512195
