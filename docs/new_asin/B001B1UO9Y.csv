3480151,5,B001B1UO9Y,This seller offered two movies at one great price.  It was better than other Goosebumps movies I could have bought because the seller was offering one DVD with two movies for the price other sellers were selling one movie.  My daughter has been wanting to see this movie for a long time and we could never find it at the movie rental store.  I bought it for a little more than it would have costed to rent it.  It was money saved and we can watch it whenever we want to now.  My daughter totally earned it and now she is happy.,1288396800,,527,4.127450980392157

8281556,3,B001B1UO9Y,"The dvd has the following episodes:
perfect school- was a good 2 part episode
my best friend is invisible- was ok the ending sucked though
an old story- was a excellent episode, not to mention that the make-up were amazing
I felt this one to be a little bit over priced for a 2 part collection. it broke it down to be almost 2 dollars an episode
I highly recommend this dvd to any are you afraid of the dark fans.",1436659200,,413,4.111111111111111
