8371127,4,B002ITADK8,"I really like the premise to this film. Though its a little low budget and rough around the edges, it has charm. There is definitely potential here. The performances range from decent to great. I think this could make a great TV series for tween viewers if it is ever revisited.",1464912000,,278,4.470588235294118
8371128,1,B002ITADK8,"This is not a movie you should see, but I gave it one and a half stars because of it's star, Courtney Halverson. Halverson is a newcomer, who hasn't done much, but she was terrific and gave a little credibility to an otherwise horrible movie. Freaky Faron was listed as Sci-Fi/Fantasy, but in reality, it's a movie that could have aired on the Disney Channel. The plot is ridiculously stupid and is played out by actors who have hardly done anything before! Halverson was funny and entertaining as the freaky girl, who seems to be psychic and smarter than every one around her. Aside from that, this movie is not worth the reel it was recorded on. I find myself having a hard time explaining to you just how bad this thing was, I mean it was so bad, that I can't even begin to describe the story for you and that in and of itself should tell you to avoid it!",1361491200,,858,4.302469135802469
8371129,5,B002ITADK8,"Freaky Faron is really a detective story/thriller with the science fiction premise that aliens are exiling criminals on the Earth.  The heroine is an alien trained Earth girl whose primary weapons are courage and intelligence.  The movie is internally consistent to a degree that very few detective or science fiction stories can maintain.  Several reviewers thought it was too slow, I thought it was well paced and frightening.  Courtney Halverson, who played Faron, did a good job and is very easy on the eyes.  When watching this movie, I suggest trying to ignore the information on the DVD cover and in other reviews.  It is frequently wrong or misleading and spoiled some of the fun of the movie for me.",1326153600,,708,4.858333333333333
8371130,3,B002ITADK8,"This is a case of close encounters of the third kind and its impact on a young girl who has to sort out her role in society as a result of those encounters. Courtney Halverson does a good job as the young girl and draws the viewer into her plight; much of the movie deals with her emotions and her reaction to the events which seem to follow her.

Although the movie seems to drag at some points the overall impression is still fairly good; there is action, suspense, and mystery so most of the elements of a good story are there. Halverson is convincing in her role as a young girl haunted by events in her past and troubled by the rejection of her school mates.

This is a movie I would recommend watching before you buy.",1319500800,,723,4.231884057971015
8371131,5,B002ITADK8,"Faron Hallowell (Courtney Halverson) is about to be released from a mental institution. It seems that when she was 11 she shot a weatherman (the T.V. type, not political) and nearly killed him. Watching the film we find that she was under the impression that she was fulfilling a part of guardian assistance is subduing rowdy aliens. Of course we all know that is impossible. Now all she wants to do is pursue a normal life and put all that behind her.

It appears that the past will not stay the past; the most innocuous actions on the part of kids and authorities are weaving a pattern that we as observers cannot keep up with even with a bevy of clues.

I kept looking around corners and just waiting for ""teenagers from space."" Of course there is always the possibility that it is just freaky Faron. The film ends way too soon and the results cause us us to do a little or our own Introspection.
