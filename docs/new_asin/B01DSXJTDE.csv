7723640,5,B01DSXJTDE,"This movie is both stunningly beautiful and wickedly funny. Kate Beckinsale captures Lady Susan beautifully. And haven't we all known someone like her--a beautiful, but selfish woman who somehow charms her way through life? As an Anglophile and antiques lover the interiors, antique furnishings, and costumes captivated me. Highly recommended for Austen lovers.",1472860800,,361,5.830188679245283
7723641,3,B01DSXJTDE,"""Facts are horrid things."" Lady Susan Vernon (Beckinsale) has just lost her husband and has moved in with her in-laws in order to straighten out her life, and to help her daughter find a suitor. Soon Lady Vernon's intentions begin to show themselves and along with the help of Alicia Johnson (Sevigny) she begins to alter the lives of all involved, some for the better, but mostly not. Being a guy I was not all that excited for this at all. I'm not a fan of period movies, and never been a fan of Jane Austin movies. That said, this one wasn't terrible. I did like the comedy aspect and did laugh a few times but what I really enjoyed was the fact that Lady Vernon was basically a con artist, and that did give me something to latch on to and watch when the movie began to get away from me. That being said, again, this is not really my type of movie, and if you are a fan of Austin and period piece movies you will most likely love this. Overall, for a genre I don't typically enjoy I did find enough in this to keep me entertained but I would not watch this again. Fans of this genre will love this though. I give it a B-.",1472515200,12,1125,4.118181818181818

7723643,3,B01DSXJTDE,"Now that the rounds have been made on all of the fine Jane Austen novels (repeated versions, some including non-Austen vampires!), we turn to a rather forgettable short novella Lady Susan as warped for the screen by director and screenwriter Walt Stillman.

The fragile little tale  Set in the 1790s, Love and Friendship centers on beautiful widow Lady Susan Vernon (Kate Beckinsale), who has come to the estate of her in-laws to wait out colorful rumors about her dalliances circulating through polite society. While there, she decides to secure a husband for herself and her rather reluctant debutante daughter, Frederica (Morfydd Clark). There is an American on the scene (Chlo Sevigny), a silly foppish wacko (Tom Bennett), lots of lords and ladies (Stephen Fry, Xavier Samuel, etc), endless beautiful costumes and scenery, but the chatter is rushed (perhaps a good thing because the script is fragile when not downright silly) and the story fails to hang together or to involve us.

About the best thing in this tepid film is the musical score with some fine excerpts from Boyce, Purcell, Charpentier, Vivaldi, Beethoven, some Handel arias beautifully sung by Chlo Martin, and Mozart  the famous trio Soave sia il vento as sung by Sarah Brady, Chlo Martin and Paul McGough.

Otherwise this is all fluff and no substance. Nice costumes and music, though. Grady Harp, August 16",1471737600,12,1380,5.061674008810573

7723645,5,B01DSXJTDE,"Haven't bought this - obviously, but will (in shop) when it comes out. Brilliant film - loved it! Based on Jane Austen's Lady Susan, a novel in letters: the only novel I can ever remember really enjoying without liking the main character. Lady Susan was a total viper! Cared nothing for anyone, even her own daughter (well, perhaps she loved her married lover - but only him!) Anyway, she got outwitted in the end, and her daughter married the man she loved. Anyway, Lady Susan's main confidents are her foolish, devoted maid and her best friend (the nearest you can get to a novel in letters I guess - after all, who would you tell more about yourself than anyone else - apart from a husband/fwife - though, I guess there'd be things you:would tell your other half but not friend and vice versa). Anyway, Lady Susan writing letters wouldn't transfer well on screen, so she talks to her best friend, whose husband doesn't like the friendship - wonder why?? What man would want his wife to be friends with such a TFB? Anyway, is very good period drama, done in a really funny way. Definitely worth watching if you like period drama",1471046400,42,1130,4.571428571428571

Second viewing better than first, and third decided to keep & even look for the book to read what was left out of this forerunner whose characters I can't much like but her writing is delish.",1516665600,2,615,4.811320754716981

I'm giving it 3.75 stars because I enjoyed watching it but thought the ending a little weak.  One of my favorite lines in the movie is when one of the characters points out that certain commandments, such as Thou shall not kill, are unnecessary since that would be wrong to do whether it was listed or not (as an atheist, that brought on some head nodding in agreement).  Added to the fact that this same character thought there were 12 commandments, that certainly brought on a laugh!",1514505600,,578,4.485714285714286

It's very different from Austen's other works (yes, I'm a huge fan)!  This is very quick-witted though like her other stories but the main character, Lady something (I forget) is not like Elizabeth Bennett at all!  Someone said she was evil or something like that.  I didn't think that at all.  The women may not be a ""proper"" lady but she is interesting.  I Highly Recommend this for all Austen fans.

The disk is obviously not a burned copy, but a regularly-produced disc.  I have never seen this warning message before (the player is a Sony BDP-S790 with no modifications, not region free.)

It was just as well; the first 20 minutes of the show were confusing and disjointed.  I doubt we will even look for it on-line.",1497225600,,572,4.623762376237623

7723679,5,B01DSXJTDE,"I'll be honest and say I didn't want to pay full price for something that might be disappointing, so I bought the dvd for less on the secondary market.  That was based on other reviews of this film and the fact that the novella, ""Lady Susan,"" is such a marginal work.  But when British producers, directors, and actors understand that Jane Austen is the author strange and beautiful things start to happen.  A slim and inconsequential story turns into an extremely well made satire and the characters spring to life.  Special note has to be made of Kate Beckinsale who looks like she's aged only a few years rather than the 20 that passed between ""Emma"" and this role as the viper, Lady Susan.  Kate is just the perfect choice for the lead character with all her natural beauty and speaking voice.  Her performance, in what had to be a very challenging part with all its fast-paced acid dialogue, is just outstanding.  Also of note are Jemma Regrave as the long-suffering, good-hearted mother and the actor who plays the dopey Sir James Martin, Tom Bennett.  My wife and I had never seen Mr. Bennett before but found him to be a scream in his speech, dancing, and other foppish ways. We'd like to see him in more productions in the future.  For those who might be looking for another ""Pride and Prejudice,"" ""Sense and Sensibility,"" or ""Emma,"" you might be in for a letdown because there are no heroic figures in the end.  But what you do get is the great satirical eye of Jane Austen as she unmasks the silly and treacherous people at the top of British society in the early 1800's.  ""Love and Friendship"" is remarkably good all the way through and moves at a fast pace.  The background music, coordinated by Mark Suozzo, seems to come mostly from Handel, Boyce, and others from the Baroque period; it is just a joy to listen to.  So much so that I ordered the soundtrack CD from Amazon at full price.  Back on the film itself, the scenery, costumes, lighting, sound, and other production values are just topnotch. Lovers of British period pieces in general and Jane Austen fans in particular need to see this film.  It's a true delight for the senses and highly recommended.",1496448000,,2175,4.583979328165374

7723694,5,B01DSXJTDE,"Unbeknownst to me, Jane Austen wrote a little-known novella called ""Lady Susan."" From that source acclaimed writer/director Whit Stillman (""Damsels in Distress"") brings us a PG-rated screenplay that captures Austen's wry wit, her observational humor and her affection for the silly human weaknesses that surrounded her.

Stillman's cast:
  * Kate Beckinsale (""The Disappointments Room"") clearly relishes her role as Lady Susan Vernon, smarter by half than the people who toss in her wake, outwitted, outflanked and outmaneuvered. She looks forward to each battle of wits, secure in the knowledge that she will, as usual, prevail.
  * Morfydd Clark (""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"") Lady Susan's daughter Frederica cannot escape the machinations of her mother... although she certainly tries.
  * Tom Bennett (Lots of BBC television) nearly steals the show as Sir James Martin. He makes Mr. Collins in ""Pride and Prejudice"" look downright intelligent. e.g., Sir James is delighted to learn that Frederica reads both poetry AND verse!
  * Chlo Sevigny (""American Horror Story"") Alicia Johnson is Lady Susan's only friend. Her husband keeps threatening to ship her back to Connecticut (""Why my dear, you'll be scalped!"").
  * Stephen Frye (""The Man Who Knew Infinity"") is her gouty husband Mr. Johnson.
  * Xavier Samuel (""Fury"") is the young. naive Reginald DeCourcy. Lady Susan plays him like a ping pong ball, bouncing him up and down even while he thinks it's all his own idea. He never sees any of it coming!
  * James Fleet (""Outlander"") is wonderful as his alarmed father Sir Reginald DeCourcy. He is painfully aware of Lady Susan's reputation and intends to protect his family.

The verbiage flies, the sly characterizations zip by and reputations are at stake! This one was suggested to me by the Swedish branch of JayFlix. I obtained the DVD from the city library and am tempted to get my own copy. I have most of Austin's comedies of manners, why not add one that has more comedy than most, and best of all, with wonderful closed captions!",1490054400,3,2049,5.071641791044776

Attempted crispness provided no development or continuity, just confusion.  Static and exceptionally uninvolved direction.  Actors might as well have been standing around reading lines and many scenes give you that very impression.  Waste for the most part of decent actors.  Cinematographer held back.

We'll have to watch it again a couple more times - there's just so much clever dialogue.  The talk is British-accented, and fast paced. It will out-pace the viewer unless you have high-speed HD hearing  -- so you will have to see it at least twice to really take it all in.

7723736,3,B01DSXJTDE,"You don't often see a new Jane Austen movie in theaters. Well, obviously ""new"" is relative -- Austen has been dead since the early 19th century, so she's unlikely to give us any new stories.

But since Austen only authored a handful of adaptable works in her lifetime, most of the books have been repeatedly adapted into movies and miniseries. So it's rather refreshing that ""Love and Friendship"" is the first movie adaptation of Jane Austen's epistolary novella ""Lady Susan"" -- a fluffy and sometimes confusing tale about a delightfully amoral widow on the prowl for men with money.

Lady Susan (Kate Beckinsale) is a recent widow with limited finances and no permanent home, visiting friends and relations to keep herself afloat while she searches for rich husbands for herself and her daughter Frederica (Morfydd Clark). Unfortunately her recent flirtation with a married man has forced her to depart in haste, and instead stay in the countryside with her in-laws -- where she immediately entrances her sister-in-law's brother, Reginald DeCourcy (Xavier Samuel).

And after her daughter is expelled from her boarding school, Lady Susan thinks she's found a perfect match for her: the amiable but stupendously dumb Sir James Martin (Tom Bennett). But her attempts to coax her daughter into a wealthy match are thrown to the wayside when she becomes the center of a massive scandal in London. Only Lady Susan's cleverness can come up with a way of restoring her fortunes!

The original novella was a piece of juvenilia that Austen never even tried to publish, and which wasn't released until several decades after her death. So unsurprisingly ""Love & Friendship"" is not as deep or incisive a story as Austen's other period tales, but it is an amusingly sharp-edged, fluffy little tale -- less about social insights and more about a particular woman whom we really shouldn't like as much as we do.

And Kate Beckinsale does a pretty serviceable job -- she isn't quite as dynamic and dazzling as the role seems to imply, but she does a pretty good job as a beautiful, smart woman who unselfconsciously prattles off spectacularly cold-hearted lines like ""What a mistake you made marrying Mr. Johnson. Too old to be governable, too young to die.""

She also has some good chemistry with Chloe Sevigny as an American lady who married a stuffy gentleman, played by Stephen Fry. As for the other actors, they tend to veer between solid low-key performances (Clark, James Fleet) and some fairly out-and-out goofiness (the endearingly doofy performance by Bennett, Jenn Murray as a hysterically whiny wife who is out for Susan's blood).

The biggest problem with the movie is that it's a bit hard to follow all the melodrama and tangled webs around Lady Susan, and the resolution to all this comes rather abruptly. Also, director Whit Stillman has the awkward tendency to introduce characters with Quentin Tarantino-style title cards. But the journey is a pleasant one, full of lush country manors, pretty dresses, and some fairly clever comic-relief (Susan desperately trying to educate her dim daughter on the Ten Commandments with a curt ""It's not a shalt not!"").

""Love & Friendship"" won't usurp the place of Austen mainstays like ""Pride and Prejudice"" or ""Emma,"" but it's a pleasantly fluffy diversion. If other Austen movies are a good meal, this is a scoop of ice cream.",1483833600,,3368,4.991087344028521

7723748,4,B01DSXJTDE,"Love and Friendship is a remarkable film by Slim Whitman, based on an early epistolary novella byJane Austen. Its refreshing because hes taken this early unfinished manuscript and been able to supplement it, rather than reduce it as with her better known works. This has freed him up to bring a more improvised, witty comedy of manners to light. This has been a project hes been thin king about for a few years. Hes been thinking about Jane Austen too for years and discussions in his earlier films have remarked on her work. Famous for his scripts and the right set of actors, not necessarily the big names, but he has worked before with Kate Beckinsdale(Lady Susan) and Chloe Sevigny(Alicia Johnson) her friend, and targeted them for this film. The film has been beautifully shot in Ireland with horses and carriages and costumes in place.

Lady Susan is a wicked,cavalier lady whos reading of mens natures is so sharp, they are like putty in her hands. She is a widow with a daughter and wants the best for both of them. Alicia is Lady Susans confidante, but she is forbidden by her husband (Stephen Fry) to meet the dissolute widow. Their meetings are conducted in secret. Of course what is behind her peripatetic wanderings is a desire for freedom and sex and a flow of money. She flirts outrageously with men, whether married, single and rich or rich and foolish. She also keeps tabs on their parents and how long theyve got to live. She impresses on her daughter Catherine(Emma Greenwell) how poor she has been and not to reject a man with wealth like Sir James Martin( Tom Bennett). His goodness being evident. However what happens can be missed in the crack of witty dialogue.

He is fool and foppish and has studied his manners out of books and stands with two poses, hand on hip or pointing and laughing his head off. Catherine is embarrassed by him. While she is paid court to by handsome,young Reginald Decourcy. Lady Susan controls groups of people and always gets her own way. Other women either cry,gasp or are staggered by her cheeky trickery. Beckinsdale is perfect at transmitting this girlish, airy innocence. Chloe Sevigny as her neutral aide-de-camp provides her anchorage for the frank exchanges and the films structure. Stillman cleverly has all her intimacies and her workings take place off screen,making her more mysterious. Tom Bennett brings a gusto of great humour to his part as idiot-suitor almost running away with the film. Stillman trusts his actors instinctively like' filming the ocean.'",1482364800,2,2524,4.840277777777778

7723827,2,B01DSXJTDE,"Kate Beckinsale stars as a near-destitute, effectively homeless widow (yet every dress is stunning). We do not live, she laments, we visit. She spends the movie scheming to insinuate herself and her daughter into the arms of two eligible bachelors but, alas, hilarity does not ensue.

Jane Austens Lady Susan is a woman of many faces, but Beckinsale (perhaps at the hand of the director, Whit Stillman) plays her with the same face and voice to every audience, including us. The result is a torrent of clever lines I found myself straining to find funny. Without so much as a hint from the performances as to each punchlines true meaning, I struggled to divine their sincerity or double-meaning in time to chuckle and still catch the next one. So, not exactly a delightful romp for me personally.

Chloe Sevigny is particularly problematic as a confidant with all the confessory appeal of a funeral service. You brilliant creature, she admires of Lady Susan (twice) with exactly the warmth of a cadaver. (She does have one very funny moment of wordless physical comedy that makes you long for more laughs like it elsewhere.) And Austens source material is a novella of letters, which leads to lots of ruminating and philosophizing out loud to characters who may or may not be worthy in the audiences mind of such candor.

I had the same problem with this isnt-this-funny punchline buffet as I did with, say, Raising Arizona, but for different reasons. Raising Arizona tried to make us laugh at ordinary people talking in florid language (it didn't work). ""Love and Friendship"" wants us to believe that absurdly rich English people find the florid, studied language of the English letter (and, by extension, the English novel) perfectly commonplace when spoken aloud. Played this straight, it just doesnt wash. Just a touch more stifled giggling, mouths agape, eyes wide, brows arched, even a mild pratfall or two from the cast and a hint of desperation once or twice from Lady Susan as to her impending circumstance, for warmth would have gone a long way. Only Tom Bennett truly acquits himself as a ridiculous bachelor whose thick skull no amount of good breeding can penetrate; and I would have loved to see more of Conor Lambert as a stoic, seen-it-all butler. The two of them (plus Jenn Murray, as the cuckqueanned Lady Manwaring) hint at a broader, less realistic approach that could have made this whole thing work. I really wish there were more smart, adult comedies at the movies, but this ones a near-miss.",1475193600,2,2515,4.871495327102804
7723828,2,B01DSXJTDE,"While the acting is spot on, the story line left me feeling agitated, which is not something that has ever happened with me before. The original story, Lady Susan was humorous and charming. This adaptation was a dismal failure. I thought it was going to be cleverly humorous in Jane Austen's impeccable style of comedy, but it was not. HONESTLY- I wish I had never viewed it much less purchased it.

Like everyone else, I hate Cinavia because all that it does is keep people who actually bought the movie from being able to watch the movie. All the people who pirated the movie will get to watch it, just not me, the person who actually bought the movie.

I will probably return it as the disk is unwatchable.

Would have liked to have seen it, because I actually really liked the book.

2.. Overly stilted and formalized dialogue that moved too quickly to get an appreciation for its meaning, thus most of the movie is a lost series of pretty scenes.
3. A pointless story that really made little sense. A period piece consisting of parlor gossip & other similar chit-chat that dominated most of the scenes.
4. Produced by Amazon Studios. My large public library, and in Amazon home territory, purchased copies of this DVD directly from Amazon for patron use. Throughout most of the playing the sound was muted (not hearable) with a grayed out message over the video saying ""[...]message code 3 audio muted because this DVD is not authorized to playback on this device.""

7723866,4,B01DSXJTDE,"Love & Friendship is an adaptation of Jane Austens novella Lady Susan, in which a beautiful young widow, Lady Susan Vernon (Kate Beckinsale), visits her in-laws estate to wait for social chatter about her personal indiscretions to abate. While there, the bright, flirtatious, egotistical Lady Susan decides to secure a husband for herself and one for her reluctant daughter, Frederica (Morfydd Clark). Enlisting the help of her old friend Alicia (Chloe Sevigny), Lady Susan attracts the attention of the young, handsome Reginald DeCourcy (Xavier Samuel), the rich and foolish Sir James Martin (Tom Bennett), and the handsome, but married, Lord Manuring (Lochlann OMearain).

Director Whit Stillman is not new to comedies of manners and makes this early Austen work very funny. Lady Susan is a woman with a reputation, but practically flaunts it as a badge of honor, pursuing her own desires despite the rigidity of her society. Way ahead of her time, she draws upon her femininity to turn mens heads and excite them with her flirtations. The fact that they may be married doesnt stop her.

The dialogue is lively and clever and a particular pleasure since so many movies have reduced dialogue to a bare minimum, letting visuals carry the story. Here, the stylish repartee, innuendos, and put-downs make for not only a funny, but also a highly satisfying, picture. Fans of Austen will love this film, as will those still suffering withdrawal from Downton Abbey.

8756807,3,B01DSXJTDE,"I love period films, but this one was kind of a drag. It was mostly talking. Some characters would talk about someone else in one scene, and in the next the subject of gossip would prove them right. Like, two ladies would talk about how this one gentleman was a bit of an idiot, and in the next scene he'd show up at the house acting a little cringey in his lack of social graces.
This goes on, back and forth, with different people and subjects. i had a few chuckles toward to end, but it was almost dizzying trying to keep up with who was who and why/ if they were falling for Kate Bekinsale's character.
