8509975,4,B0074JOVB4,"Faith Domergue came over to England in the Fifties to make three
B movies all darn good ones.

She was a ""good girl"" in the other two films but she is real bad in
this one.

Faith and that fine actor Martin Benson play Sicilian brother and
sister who more or less control the Soho rackets in 1950s London.

Well directed with good location work and excellent production design
by Ken Adam no less, this is a film no B movie lover should be without.

Remastered in widescreen DVD looks great too!",1347494400,3,495,4.3478260869565215
