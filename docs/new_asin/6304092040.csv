776088,5,6304092040,"This is Audie's film from 1966, brought to us from John C. Champion, who was behind the NBC-TV series Laramie (1959-63). It pays homage to one of the main characters of Laramie, Jess Harper, by having Audie's Texican character being named Jess as well. Jess' main nemesis is a town boss played by veteran actor Broderick Crawford (of Highway Patrol fame); it occurs that Brod's character killed Jess' older brother in cold blood; Roy ran a newspaper that spoke out against the town boss and now Jess wants to avenge Roy's death.

I read that this film wasn't easy for Murphy to make; he had to do all his own stunts. But he does them well.",1286150400,6,639,4.508620689655173
776089,4,6304092040,"One of Audie Murphy's later westerns and (I think) his only real spaghetti western.  Most reviews of this film note how unremarkable it is...but I think fans of the genre will find it to be a tightly plotted, well shot (and in certain scenes very nicely lit) film.  The plot involves a fairly typical revenge tale with a little bit of detective work thrown in to stretch the story prior to the final showdown.  Acting is average for Spanish-Italian productons from this period with a solid turn by Audie Murphy as the anti-hero gunfighter.  I thought the shoot-outs were particularly well staged and nicely shot.  Overall, I was surprised at how much I liked this film...it is unpretentious, tells a familiar tale in a clear manner, and moves along at a solid pace.  There are also some interesting minor characters included, too.  A safe buy for Audie Murhpy fans and worth a look to hardcore western buffs.",1278892800,4,908,4.745222929936306
776090,1,6304092040,"The Texican appeared to be a spaghetti Western. The scenery and horses
were typical of Spain. The story line was not all that exciting. Usual
brutish bad guys of spaghetti westerns. Surprised that Murphy would lend
himself to this type of western. Audie is starting to show his age. Possibly good roles were not available to him because of disapation,
drinking.",1234742400,7,361,4.934426229508197
776091,3,6304092040,"A clean-cut Audie Murphy stars in veteran western director Lesley Selander's gritty shoot'em up ""The Texican"" as a man confined in exile in Mexico because the authorities have placed $500 dollars bounty on his head in Texas across the Rio Grande. In the first scene, Jess Carlin (Audie Murphy of ""The Cimarron Kid"") turns over a horse thief to an American lawman, U.S. Marshal Dick (Luis Induni of ""The Mysterious Island of Captain Nemo""), who meets with him at a rendezvous point on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande. Dick warns Carlin that as long as Carlin stays below the border that the law won't bother him. Initially, Carlin has no plans to cross over the border; he is cooling his heels in Mexico somewhat like Errol Flynn did in the 1945 Warner Brothers western ""San Antonio."" However, the idyllic paradise that Jess Carlin has grown accustomed to in the form of a pretty senorita, Elena (Marta May of ""Seven Pistols for a Gringo"") and a noisy little Mexican game of pitching stones at firecrackers on rocks to see who can set off the largest number retreats in his fond memories of the past after he learns from another American taking a siesta in Mexico that his upright, well-meaning brother Roy Carlin has been murdered.

John C. Champion and Jose Antonio de La Loma never clearly indicate what our protagonist did to get himself exiled to old Mexico. Villainous Luke Starr framed him for something, but that something is left unspecified. One day a down-on-his-luck American tries to pay for his liquor with a double-headed coin and Pablo, an irate Mexican barkeep, nearly beats him to a pulp. Jess helps the cowboy recover. At this point, our peace-loving protagonist learns from the cowboy that his brother, crusading Clarion newspaper editor Roy Carlin (Victor Vilanova of ""The Killer with a Thousand Eyes""), has died in a gunfight. In the previous scene, the thoroughly repugnant and unrepentant Luke Starr (Oscar winning actor Broderick Crawford of ""All the King's Men"") guns Jess Carlin's brother Roy down in cold-blood and then arranges things so that appears like Roy shot it out with another gunman. Actually, the other gunman could have cleared Jess of Luke's charges, but neither he nor Roy survive their secret rendezvous as a stagecoach station twelve miles out of Rimrock.

Luke Starr's right-hand gunslinger Gil Rio (ubiquitous Spaghetti western star Aldo Sambrell of ""Navajo Joe"") guns down the other man. No sooner does Jess cross the border than a couple of bounty hunters descend on him. Jess wounds one, a bounty hunter who says he is after him because he needs money for his sick wife, and kills the other one outright. Later, that evening, three gunmen shoot up Jess' camp and he has to high-tail bare back on his horse to escape them. At an apparently deserted ranch, Jess leaves $40 for a saddle, but the owner Sandy Adams (Luz Marquez of ""Three Sergeants of Bengal"") catches him in the act. She relents when he explains his difficulty and then he rides into town. Since there is no law in the town run by Luke Starr, Jess doesn't have to concern himself with the authorities or bounty hunters. Jess and Luke circle each other for the remainder of this trim 81-minute horse opera lensed in Spain with a largely Hispanic cast. Eventually, Jess squares off with Luke's gunslingers on a main street shoot-out in a sandstorm and then he takes care of Luke.

The sight of Audie Murphy riding across the arid plains of Spain to composer Nico Fidenco's first-rate orchestral western score in an above-average oater is enough of a reason to watch ""The Texican."" Selander directs in his usual style, letting the cast play out their roles in long shot so that we can see them in relation to one another. Selander takes advantage of the sprawling Spanish scenery and incorpoates it into the action, particularly when our hero displays his superb horsemanship skills by taking his animal down a steep ridge. The sets look authentic enough and the wagons have the right size wheels on them. Were it not for some of the accents, you'd have no way of telling that this revenge western wasn't of the domestic variety. Some quotable dialogue enhances the action, and gravelly voiced Broderick Crawford is slimy villain who gets what he deserves in the end.

""The Texican"" doesn't have any commentary tracks, but both the picture and sound quality are good.  I've seen this oater many times and I don't have any problems with the actors speaking.  However, you must remember that most of the thespians here are Europeans and their dialogue has been dubbed so that the voice coming out of their mouth probably isn't their voice.  Nevertheless, the dubbing didn't interfere with the action.",1225670400,11,4709,4.83498759305211
776092,3,6304092040,"Audie Murphy, the real life WWII Soldier/Hero stars in his only Spaghetti Western. That alone should seal the deal for anyone with any interest in the Italian Western films of the 60s and 70s. Worthy of any Western collection.",1206662400,3,226,4.82051282051282
776093,2,6304092040,"This is a nice film to look at thanks to longtime director of American Westerns Lesley Selander, Spanish cinematographer Francisco Marn, and stunning Spanish vistas. They almost make the film worthwhile.

Almost. The misnamed John Champion wrote a script so aimless that it failed to build tension in me. The final shootouts failed to disturb my heart rate. And I found the final stroll into the sunset is striking but uninspiring.

This qualifies as a Spaghetti Western, I suppose, even without the Italians' involvement. The music and the sound effects are unmistakable. This time, however, the many European supporting actors are poorly dubbed by bad American actors.

Somehow, this film fits comfortably into the Audie Murphy canon. I didn't find it as alien as the more famous Spaghetti Westerns. Audie's persona dominates in the usual way. He's in his familiar amiable mode despite his character's bent on vengence. By this time in his career (his third to the last film), he could do those roles with his eyes closed. Maybe he didn't want to be too much better than the script.",1187049600,14,1084,4.9779005524861875
776094,5,6304092040,"This film was canned in Europe (Spain)and hauntingly similar to the style set by Sergio Leone in his Eastwood ""Man with No Name"" trilogy. The supporting actors are mostly Spanish except for the familiar figure of screen heavy Broderick Crawford. There is a  blending of the Hollywood Westerns and the Italian Spaghettis in this one. The dubbing is so obvious (typical of spaghetties)but  the storyline is easy to follow (typical of Hollywood westerns). Murphy's boyish looking demeanor is still here but his age shows in this one. The protagoinists still dress decently and ""cleanly"" (typical of Hollywood). The only reference to the slovenly atmosphere, dirt and perspiration stink (in Spaghetties) are the presence of flies stealing the scenes in some shots. The gunfire (whistling type of blast)and the Morricone type of music (done to nauseating extremes) definitley makes this a Spaghetti western with its good qualities. The distracting and dizzying closeup-shots of Italian spaghettis thankfully were not incorporated into this movie. If you have been accustomed to the Hollywood B westerns by Audie Murphy at Universal, this movie is still of similar mode, except that it has the spaghetti taste in it. This is a good movie for western fanatics who enjoy the genre.",1116115200,35,1273,5.235294117647059

776282,3,6304092040,"The Texican, 1966 film

It begins in desert badlands. Two men approach a sheriff; one is turned over as a captive, the other is also wanted. [The good bad guy?] Two men in a relay station talk about change in the Cherokee Strip and Luke Starr. There are surprises tonight. An editor is censored permanently. Then a rider falls from his horse. In town men play a game. To be good at anything a man must pay a price. Then there is a fist fight between two men in public. The loser left Rim Rock to stay out of trouble. Roy Carlin, the newspaper editor, was shot down. His brother Jess will go back, he tells Elena. He stops at a tavern for a drink. A man offers to buy his horse. A bounty hunter needs money badly, his wife is sick. He and his buddy try to take Jess in, a bad career move for them.

The Boss of a gang wants to get Jess. A missed rifle shot warns Jess, who rides away without his belongings. [The long shot for a stunt double?] Jess arrives at a small ranch and pays $40 for a $10 saddle. Sandy Adams warns him about Rim Rock. Jess gets a room at a hotel owned by Luke Starr. Jess meets him and they converse. Frank Grady wants to talk to him, the town needs someone to stand up to Luke Starr. [The powerful ruler of this town.] Jess visits that relay station and finds a dying man. Who shot you? Later a whiskey salesman says hello, they watch dancing girls at the saloon. [It is not the Can-Can.] Thompson plays cards with Starr. A young woman checks the account books, she is the heiress of Starrs partner. She also talks to Jess. We hear a gunshot. Thompson will be removed in secret. Jess kisses Kit ONeil, then visits the closed newspaper office. Starr visits to advise him to leave town. Jess sees Sandy again. He stops a runaway surrey, Kit is in it.

Jess sees men on the street, one of them is Thompson. He investigates and is shot at; he returns the compliment. There is a fist fight in the tavern, Jess wins. Then another man attacks him. A man tells Jess others are looking for a leader against Starr. Maria tells Jess about her husbands death. Be careful. Kit joins Jess for breakfast. Starr tells Jess to leave town, or else. Jess visits Sandy. That found rowel is traced to Luke Starrs holster. Jess visits Starr, there is talk and then a gun fight. Roys death is avenged, the rule of Starr is ended. [But power hates a vacuum, who will takeover the town? Economic power leads to political power, and vice-versa. Who controls your town?]

This 1966 movie echoes the themes from classic western movies. A powerful landowner controls the area and dominates people. Can the people break free and act in their own interest? A lone man rides into town to free the people from their oppression. In the real world of 19th century western America people would form a Committee of Vigilance, like a militia, to rid themselves of criminals when local government was in cahoots with organized crime. Are better off in letting government tolerate organized crime? One problem with vigilantes is they could act in anger and strike out blindly. Convicting the innocent also happens with regular governmental rule. [Note the doubled voices and the use of sound effects like gunshot.]",1425427200,,3199,4.453924914675768

He is very adult in his re-actions in this story.  He still comes across as the true stoic as always, but now the humanity shows through.  He is terrific in this picture.

Directed by Lesley Selander

Wanted north of the border, Jess Carlin (Audie Murphy) resides safely in Mexico. But when he hears that his brother was killed in a gunfight with another man. But he well realizes that his brother never carried a gun so he heads north to find his brother's killer. After battling bounty hunters he arrives in Rimrock, a town controlled by Luke Starr (Broderick Crawford). Starr is the man he wants but he needs to find the evidence

This is Audie's ""Spaghetti Western"" which he filmed in Spain with only director Selander & co-star Crawford for US-style company amongst a cast full of non-English speaking players. These cast-members spoke Spanish in the film and their lines are dubbed into English. Please note that said dubbing is not the greatest. However the visuals are stunning thanks to excellent work by Spanish cinematographer Francisco Marn.

One of my favorite directors of B-Westerns Lesley Selander gives this film a nice touch, even though the story was weak.

776572,2,6304092040,Poor video quality & english dubbed on most of the actors. Typical sound effects as in all Italian westerns.  Pass on this movie.  I am a fan of Audie Murphy [ life and movies] but this movie stinks,1298073600,2,198,4.184210526315789
776573,4,6304092040,"This was more of an experimental western. Why? Because the average length of a film shot between cuts was seven seconds. Yes, it was a fast-paced western. And it's uncommon in spaghetti westerns since they usually had long shots. A clean-cut Audie Murphy stars in veteran western director Lesley Selander's gritty shoot'em up ""The Texican"" as a man confined in exile in Mexico because the authorities have placed $500 dollars bounty on his head in Texas across the Rio Grande. And it doesn't have Italian actors. They are Mexican actors. And for a European film! Good to see Broderick Crawford in a role that he wasn't obviously taking to the bottle behind the camera. But at the end of the movie, Crawford's character is shot and falls from a balcony. The stuntman who does the fall is obviously one hundred pounds lighter and much thinner than Crawford. Too obvious to overlook. The gun shots are obviously dubbed in and fake as well. If you like watching Audie Murphy westerns, and want to try something new, this is worth a peak.",1295827200,3,1033,4.7444444444444445
