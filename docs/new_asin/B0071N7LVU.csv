8508517,3,B0071N7LVU,"First, I have to put out a bit of a disclaimer - I knew Sid Lucero back in the day since we once went to school together. I'm not claiming to know him all that well based on that, nor am I disillusioned to think that my knowledge of him as a student in any way impacts his life as an actor. In only bring this up since part of the reason I took so long before watching this movie was me unsure if I wanted to see someone that I knew personally involved in the kind of soft core love scenes that we typically get in these ""indies"". But hey, it's all part of the cultural experience, right? Sooner or later you're bound to encounter someone that you know in real life up there on the big screen, or maybe just on your TV. And sometimes they're naked.

But back on point, I suppose this story might of made more sense as a screenplay. It has a rather epic scale and intellectuals love stories that try to explore some aspect of great moments in history like the Martial Law years. I can appreciate how a story like this could win a writing award. But overall execution didn't quite go all the way and I can see why it had more acting award nominations as opposed to directing. The only other Adolfo Alix movie that I've seen thus far was Daybreak, and that one didn't impress me at all.

Potential personal bias aside, Sid Lucero was pretty great as Jun. He conveyed a lot of complex emotions throughout the movie and he certainly has a pretense about him on-screen. He brought a certain intensity to the role, which was essential to it working. Cogie Domingo seemed a little understated in contrast - almost to the point of being coldly deadpan or something. And while I know he had to play things a little cooler given the nature of his character, I think it went too far and it was hard to feel any emotional sympathy for him more often than not. And that's kinda sad since I had a bit of a crush on Cogie Domingo back in the day. I didn't feel anything for him in this movie.

Everyone else was just so much window dressing. Clearly the likes of Salumbides had been cast due to their physique or something. Being a model doesn't make you a good actor, unfortunately.

Direction for this movie was horribly rough. I needed a better way of transitioning between the scenes. And I'm not talking about some literal overlay of Baguio, 1972 flashing on the screen or something. But simply cutting to the next period without any thought just made the movie a little confusing at times. And since it only depicts the times that Errol visits Baguio, you can imagine that there are a lot of jumps of time between visits. There were a few clever moments but more often than not you get confused little scenes that don't really add more value. And we also have a weird decision that the sex scenes almost always involve Jun riding Errol - but hey, maybe the character was just really into that position.

Whether it's a failure of the writing or the direction, what bothered me most is that I don't understand what exactly defined the relationship between Jun and Errol. Sure there's the visits over the years, but we don't really see what makes things so special and magical. And given that both of them find love with other people, this long-running affair is just...weird. And they never really act on it and ultimately the only solution to things is to wait for their partners to die in order to finally allow for them to be together. Although whether or not this is really what they wanted is unclear since it was never truly revealed in the narrative what kept bringing these two together year after year after year.

Muli actually means ""again"" by most typical translations and I don't necessarily see myself watching this movie again. It was just okay but nothing amazing and the Martial Law aspect to things felt tacked on and not at all essential to the overall plot.",1408320000,,3866,4.430379746835443
8508518,5,B0071N7LVU,"Before I got this movie, I was thinking that it would most likely be like all the other movies with the same theme. But then the fact that the treatment may be different made me go ahead and see it for myself.  After all, Sid Lucero has had a very good track of tasteful movies.  When I got the movie, I saw what I always wanted in any performance:  the artists don't show me how they feel, but they make me feel how they feel. You can feel their desire, they're eagerness, their anxiety, their yearning, and their love. Also, this movie joins the ranks of movies that present love or sex scenes in a most natural and honest, and non-typical way.  Such high taste!  I very highly recommend this movie because I consider it of its very high artistic merit and very least commercialism.",1331424000,3,784,4.379310344827586
