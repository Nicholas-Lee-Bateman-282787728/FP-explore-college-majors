8124651,4,B000FMJDHY,"Producer/Director Lloyd Simandl has hit upon a very successful formula in his 'Bound Heat' series of direct to DVD ero-ductions - and the disk entitled ""Betrayed Innocence"" is a prime example of his milieu.

If you start from the lofty premise that (duh!) 'guys like to view attractive young naked women', and add a dash of light weight dominance/submission to the mix - that's pretty much what Simandi serves up in virtually ALL of his 'films'. Many of his 'plots' deal rather simplistically with the concept of 'female slavery' either in 'ancient times' or the 'present day' and the concept of taking a group of 'captured girls' through the process of being 'examined / conditioned / and auctioned off to the highest bidder' generally forms the basis for the 'action' in many of his features - including THIS one.

In ""Betrayed Innocence"" this 'action' starts off immediately as, behind the credits, a new group of 6 girls are brought into the realm of a female slave marketer and they are forced to strip down and reveal their 'attributes'. There is already a second similar group of females at the dungeon-like facility who are ready to be 'sold' and the essence of this flik is to portray the selling of this group and then follow the new girls as they go thru the same process. There is a tiny attempt at some 'intrigue' via a sub-plot that involves a guy who is trying to double-cross the female boss using one of the girls as an accomplice.  This back-fires and offers the opportunity for a few whipping/interrogation scenes of the hapless young woman (per the image on the box cover) - BUT - mostly itz just a parade of comely naked female flesh as the girls are put through their paces in being trained to become docile sex slaves for their potential new 'masters'.

On one level this can all be considered horribly politically incorrect - but if one accepts it as a simple fantasy scenario it provides lotsa hot imagery to fuel the imagination - as well as other body parts! The most positive element of Simandi's product is the high quality of the young Eastern European beauties that he populates his films with - every one of them is gorgeous and typically naked, or in some fetish outfit, all the time! Full female nudity is abundant throughout each flik but the (mostly girl/girl) erotic 'action' is all simulated soft-core fare. The negative factor is that there is a 'sameness' to everything and the characters are all pretty mono-dimensional and amateurishly acted within the threadbare plot-lines.

But - if one simply wants to feast their eyes on a parade of nubile young euro-hotties in mildly abusive situations - then the Bound Heat product (and ""Betrayed Innocence"") give good value for your buck!  The visual quality is hi-def crystal clear in full screen mode - there are a few extras - mostly 'stills' from the production and some trailers for other Bound Heat offerings. It worked 4 me!",1420070400,4,2915,4.75098814229249
