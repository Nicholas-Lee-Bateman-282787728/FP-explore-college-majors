4685785,5,B005FUTBWS,"I saw this first at the Cobb Energy Center screening in Atlanta and loved it the first time. If you are not a Kevin Smith fan then that is ok (kinda) because this movie rocks. It is like nothing he has done before. It has the raunchiness of his films however, though the thriller aspect of the film is really where it stands apart. If you love indie-film then it is easy to get behind a film like this one. I only give it five stars because 6 stars is not an option. Seriously...pre-theatrical.....rent it.....or pre-order the blu-ray....just watch it.",1314835200,2,552,4.53
4685786,5,B005FUTBWS,"How ironic it is that a movie seemingly rooted in religion can be both violent and thrilling? I think Kevin Smith's ""Red State"" is a dazzling homage to exploitation film and character study, and it's one that any adult can both appreciate and enjoy. From the opening shot, there's an unsettling, uneven tone that propels the rest of the film along. And there are plenty of twists to surprise the audience.

The primary character seems to be Cooper's Dell: a ""compound"" is defined as two or more similar substances that can be separated into simpler substances. And Cooper's Dell has a little bit of everything-spiritual hope (in the oddly peaceful scenes within the altar), tension within the population (as characters come and go), and lots of unpredictability. This religious compound is definitely the star, and its' landscape slowly unfolds as we wind our way through its' maze.

Two characters that deserve special recognition: Abin Cooper (Michael Parks) is so down-to-earth and sweet-hearted that you might not see the monster behind the eyes. And Special Agent Keenan (John Goodman), while handling much of the film's plot development, still manages to turn out a fine performance, even as the climax subsides. Both men undergo a ""conversion"" of sorts--one towards insanity, the other towards enlightenment.

If you've followed Kevin Smith on Twitter anytime in the past year, you'll already know that this film is a departure for him. Believe it or not, it's oddly similar to ""Cop Out"" (translation: fast, fun, and a complete left-turn). But it does touch close to documentaries like ""Jesus Camp"" and (gasp) ""Waco: The Rules Of Engagement"", so there's a shred of truth.  It definitely deserves an audience of adults to discuss afterward. If you like what you see after renting ""Red State"", the story doesn't stop here. You can search for Kevin Smith's podcasts about the making of the film (Google it!) to learn more.

(One note: I watched wirelessly via Roku, renting the HD version. I connected wirelessly @ 7MBps, but was still streaming @ low quality, so you might consider renting the SD version for $1 less if you don't have a speedy connection.)",1314835200,2,2161,5.008356545961003
4685787,4,B005FUTBWS,"In the Horror or Suspense genre, Red State is likely the best of both you'll see this year. Very well written and directed, you will be gripped from the very beginning. And if Inglorious Bastards' Christoph Waltz or, for that matter, The Dark Knight's Heath Ledger, earned them an Academy Award for Best supporting Actor for playing the villain, there will be no greater sin in cinema if Michael Parks is not nominated.",1314835200,7,419,4.7534246575342465
4685788,5,B005FUTBWS,"Fantastic film, unlike anything Smith has done before. Absolutely riveting from beginning to end. Do yourself a favor and skip the trailer, the best way to go into this movie is completely blind. Great twists and an unprecedented mix of comedy, action, and horror. I saw this with my girlfriend (who has never really been a Smith fan) and we talked about it for weeks (and still do now that it is out on Instant-View). Check it out, you won't be disappointed.",1314835200,3,459,4.609756097560975
4685789,5,B005FUTBWS,"I have been waiting to see this movie for months. I heard about it from Kevin smiths smodcast, including the redstate of the union podcast he did about the movie and the filming . This movie does not disappoint and if you didn't know it's a Kevin Smith film you wouldn't have guessed it in a million years. I sat there with my jaw dropped and my eyes wide open through the whole thing. The film looks fantastic, I really like the look from those red cameras. They are so clean and crisp. Michael Parks and Melissa Leo are amazing at the craft of acting and I hope they get honored for this film. So watch this movie for two reasons, to see great acting and great story telling. I have always been a Kevin smith fan and after watching this movie I understand why he is so proud of it!",1314835200,2,783,4.19205298013245

4685791,5,B005FUTBWS,Two fantastic plot twists that you will not see coming.  A tight 90 minutes.  Not one minute wasted.  John Goodman is fantastic.  Definitely worth the $9.99 Rental Fee.,1314835200,2,168,4.892857142857143
4685792,5,B005FUTBWS,"Kevin Smith's Red State pulled the carpet out from under me over and over again. This movie had so many twists and turns, keeping me guessing from start to finish. Until you see the closing credits, it's impossible to even guess that this is a Kevin Smith film.

I waited months and months to see Red State since the tour began in March, but Kevin never brought the film here to Dallas. I waited up all night to see Red State, and it finally popped up at 5:00 am. It was well worth the wait. Although I never expected the things I saw in this film, it still met my personal expectations after all the months of hype from Smodcast.com and S.I.R. radio.

The movie left me feeling empty, sad, and hopeless. The things that happened on the screen in front of me made me feel disgusted, shocked, appalled and speechless.

I loved every single minute of it.

If Michael Parks and Melissa Leo don't get nominated for any awards this winter, it would be an absolute shame.

Do yourselves a favor: watch this movie with your friends, your girlfriend, your boyfriend, whatever! This movie needs to be watched with more than one person as it is absolutely priceless to turn and see your friends' reactions to the horror that is Red State.

5/5",1314835200,,1233,4.482142857142857
4685793,5,B005FUTBWS,"I had the pleasure of seeing this movie on the Red State tour when it made its way to Seattle. John Goodman gives a stunning performance and this tale of morality and the choices we make is a brilliant story. Critics of Smith's visual style will be surprised to see a movie as visually interesting as the story is gripping and the characters well developed and intriguing.
I love the shades of gray within the story. Everyone has their motives for their actions good and bad and much like real life, there are no clear cut good guys and bad guys. It's not that kind of story.
I am really looking forward to seeing it again and sharing it with all my friends who did not have a chance to see it while it was on tour.",1313539200,66,715,4.226277372262774

But aside from the title, this is a five star quality movie even before the great John Goodman shows up.  A godawful story of a radical fundamentalist congregation of Born Again Jeffrey Dahmer clones -- where the women are even crazier than the men.

4685806,5,B005FUTBWS,"In a world of mega-blockbusters, this movie stands out. It is a ""small story"" told very well. Being a fan of K.S. I found this movie to be an extreme departure from his traditional work and one that haunts me to this day. To me, it puts him where the puck is going to be like his work with Malrats and Dogma. A rough and tumble movie that forces you to ask more questions when the credits roll, not because of a lack of story telling, but because it makes you think.",1502668800,,466,4.076086956521739

4685808,4,B005FUTBWS,"This movie is an example of how people w/ many similarities, and few differences, can devolve back into savages when fighting for a self-perceived goal or belief, law, right, etc.. When we allow groups to assemble and usurp power through violence and fear, we invite disaster, slavery and injustice. The Agent's (John Goodman) story about the sibling bloodhounds portrays how quickly we can turn on one another when we feel threatened or subjugated. We allow ourselves to become enemies to our neighbors, friends, even our families, for the sake of an idea that's not even our own. A myriad of people willing to fight and die for someone else's thoughts or delusions. In a melting pot like America, where people are free to practice opposing ideas and beliefs under the hand of a government that has it's own dualistic ideologies, opposition can easily boil over and spill into the lives of others, causing chaos.

I think the moral of the story is to love thy neighbors, friends and family despite your differences. If we let these things divide us, we're no better than dogs.",1501200000,,1077,4.853260869565218

4685811,1,B005FUTBWS,"One might wonder what manner of person writes such a whimsically sinister tale that distorts reality to such as degree as it is no longer recognizable.

My biggest disappointment with this movie is the title. The movie has nothing to do with Red State. State IS the government, but here it is used to represent Christians en total.

I am at a loss as to why established actors such as Parks and Goodman would participate in this kind of partisan pig puddle. The writing here was extremely brittle, one-sided and poor. The acting was not much better.

The movie made little sense outside of being a vehicle for a bloody, demonizing attack on Christians and law enforcement officials. Little in the way of special effects.

WHAT was the John Goodman scene at the end? Did the director realize they were short on footage and write this anti-climax scene in? And then another one with Parks singing a hymn in his prison cell. I just didn't feel this movie was worth either the money or the time I spent.

I cannot recommend this to anyone for any reason.",1498003200,6,1050,4.593582887700535

4685815,5,B005FUTBWS,"This story resembles the 1993 standoff at Waco (Bill Clinton President/Janet Reno Attorney General). That incident resulted in numerous deaths when FBI forces failed to get armed residents of the Branch Davidians' compound, led by David Koresh, to surrender peacefully. As always, Hollywood is shows bias against the US government in the narrative. However, the movie did not make the members of the congregation harmless innocents. They were clearly portrayed as murderous bigots. Except for the young children, viewers are unlikely to have sympathy for the group.
Michael Parks is absolutely superb as the fundamentalist leader of the group with able assistance from the rest of the cast, especially Melissa Leo and John Goodman.
I bought the movie because I am a great fan of Michael Parks' worth. This is one of last movies as he died this year (2017) at the age of 77.",1494374400,,873,5.027586206896552

4685822,5,B005FUTBWS,This movie definitely has its place in cinema. It is intense and scary. And things like this happen in real life. It does a great job at highlighting some very sick people in this world who justify their extreme and radical actions because of their religion or beliefs. What makes this movie all the more interesting in the reason the film was made.

They go to a shabby trailer in the woods where they meet a woman old enough to be their mother, but nevertheless they get excited about having sex with her and drink beer, which she had laced with some roofie. Once passed out, she takes the boys to a cult church compound where they must be ritually killed, because they are sinners.

This town is the home of a Chrisschun religious cult, and they placed the ad. Try to imagine what the gay-hating and sex-hating Westboro Baptist Church would be like if they decided to take God's Law into their own hands and start killing the sinners themselves. Then try to imagine the situation escalating into a machine-gun-fire standoff with the ATF. What makes this such a good horror movie is that the horror could actually happen in the US.

4685882,1,B005FUTBWS,"I just don't know about Kevin Smith anymore.  I've mentioned in my review of ""Tusk"" that I've been a fan of his movies for over a decade and I have all of them and like re-watching them often.  But his work lately has just gone downhill.  Watching this movie wasn't funny, it wasn't action packed, it wasn't scary, it was just messed up.  At several points I was just fast forwarding and thinking, ""Okay yup, horny teens planning to have sex,"" or, ""Okay gun battle with no real dialogue, I can skip ahead a bit,"" and finally, ""G-Man being reprimanded for following his humanity rather than sadistic orders from his boss, I've seen this in dozens of other movies, I can skip this part.""

The movie is always either disturbing or boring, or completely predictable.  I don't know what Kevin is trying to do with these movies that he's making these days, but he really isn't making good movies anymore.  Maybe he just just go back to the Jay and Bob movies, or even try writing comics again.  Heck maybe he should just stick to podcasting and just travel the convention circuit and work on promoting Jay and Bob's Secret Stash.  Cuz it sure seems like he can't make good movies anymore.",1423353600,5,1182,4.537735849056604
4685883,5,B005FUTBWS,"As a Christian, I had to come in open-minded about the portrayals of certain religious groups.  Overall, there were 2 small ""extreme"" parties (the 5 Points Church and the appalling FBI superiors).  In a way, the driving force of the movie is the how the more moderate characters (John Goodman, the FBI agent who believes in due process, and Abel's granddaughter who seeks the safety of the young children) are walking a tightrope between the orders of their superiors and their own personal values.  Most of the deaths came at no surprise, but the deus ex machina at the end was clever, funny, and humorous.  Parks' performance is obviously as good as the fans tout, and I also think Goodman killed it in his role as well.  It is definitely an artistic movie, and the climax makes up for most perceived shortcomings.",1423180800,,816,4.71830985915493

4685896,5,B005FUTBWS,"Red State is an incredibly violent film.  What's most surprising is that the writing takes a few different turns so you're always expecting the unexpected.  It's about a group of teenage boys tricked into have sex with a woman only to find it's a trap and immediately find themselves unable to escape the grip of a religious group hiding out inside a church that strongly supports punishing those who commit sins and specifically man/man action (yeah amazon won't let me drop the ""H"" word).

What makes this movie so enjoyable is that the acting is terrific.  Michael Parks in particular playing the role of a preacher convincing the church members that God punishes those who sin and he's *extremely* good in his role, though perhaps the speech he gives is a few minutes overlong.  While the speech sounds convincing, it might surprise you to know that by the end of the movie -and perhaps this is a SPOILER- the writing and atmosphere sort of changes so it feels more like a mockery.  The mockery being that overly religious people can't be taken seriously.  At least that's the way it's presented.

What I like about the film are all the unpredictable segments.  You'd think that when 3 teenage boys are trapped in a church and about to be punished and tortured, that they'd eventually escape right?  Well yes and no.  The story seems to venture in that direction for a little while, but the movie actually gradually changes in a couple different directions with a different focus.  After a while John Goodman comes into the picture when it's discovered a religious cult is causing enormous trouble inside a church out in the country.  Then the story takes an almost war-like storyline approach as the cult members and the FBI are gun fighting for a good chunk of the second half of the film.  On another note, it's almost laughable how much gunfire is being exchanged while a couple actors are having normal conversations inside the church acting as if nothing unusual is happening just outside their window!

John Goodman is convincing as a concerned FBI agent and perhaps some of the best acting I've ever seen the man do (of course I'm not a fan of his comedy style which is luckily absent here) however the final 10 minutes comes with mixed feelings due to the writing.  There needed to be a better way to wrap up the story besides... well I won't spoil it, so let's just say all the action/violence/cult meetings eventually dissolves and concludes in a very unsatisfying way.  John Goodman's splendid character goes another route and the movie ends on a semi-bizarre note I have to say.

However when the one caught teenage boy is eventually demanded to help free the children trapped in the church courtesy of one of the cult members coming up with a game plan, the story gets really good here.  Some surprising things happen afterwards that caught me by surprise once again, so Red State does have its share of excellent moments.  I'm giving the film 5 stars since the acting is phenomenal, the violence quite gory and bloody and the story overall entertaining with several unpredictable plot twists, but I can imagine not everyone would find this movie faultless.",1415318400,,3175,4.759124087591241

4685901,3,B005FUTBWS,"Man...I just finished watching this, and Kevin Smith really did a great job making a horror film.

I've never seen Last House on the Left or anything too extreme, I've never cared for the Saw Franchise but I always have loved horror films.

A lot of modern horror films rely on making you jump or whatever, in Red State Kevin Smith really, really created an excellent horror film.

After about five minutes in you start feeling like you're suffocating. That first scene where they're all in the church, that inspired true horror in me. This whole film did.

It doesn't set out to give you nightmares or make you jump, at least with me, it just really, really disturbed me, it's hard to catch your breath at times.

And that's because Kevin Smith did a great job with this horror film. I don't take this to have almost anything to do with politics or religion, really. There are a ton of wack-jobs out there, but to say that 99.9 percent of religious people aren't crazy is a dis-service to religious people. It doesn't take a genius to know that religion doesn't equal pure evil.

But within the framework of a horror film, Kevin Smith does a perfect, perfect job.

Just for the record, before I watched this I watched the 1930's version of Frankenstein, in a sense they were so similar, in their approach to horror. Nothing makes you jump in Frankenstein, it's the sheer human cruelty that's frightening, it's the Monster's literal and agonized crying at the end of the film that bothers you.

Personally I was kind of expecting this movie to be kind of funny, I guess that's what Kevin Smith was probably hoping.

As far as I'm concerned this is an excellent horror film, but man...that was intense experience.",1412467200,3,1712,4.623762376237623

When you see a film, you expect the filmmakers will ask you to suspend your beliefs slightly in order to enjoy their film, but these filmmakers ask for a complete rejection of reality.

Second, what does the title of this movie, ""Red State,"" have anything to do with the plot!?! It could not be in reference to American conservatism or communism because these are absent from the tale.

Thanks mostly to Michael Parks, who plays a wacked out psychotic preacher to perfection. His role here topped only by his short appearance as a bordello owner in Kill Bill II, is simply fantastic. It's a little bit of a hammy peerformance, yet simply wonderful. Other than this and some pretty interesting acting by several cast members, this film is just plain silly. The story about a bunch of religious nit wits,unlike the actual Westboro Babtist bunch of fanatics, is simply stupid. You have on one hand some truly good veteran actos like Parks, John Goodman, and Kevin Pollack. And on the other hand you have one helluva mess of a movie, that is so heavy handed it should make you feel like a fool for putting the time into it in the first place.

4685933,4,B005FUTBWS,"Three teens become the unsuspecting hostages of an extremist religious cult after accepting an online invitation for sex in the explosive thriller, RED STATE. Kevin Smith moves away from comedy in a daring and frighteningly realistic social commentary that serves as a vehement strike against the current domestic policy in America. With the events following 9/11 and the Westboro Baptist Church fresh in mind, Smith not only attacks the fanaticism of mindless religious zealots, but also the media's role in perpetuating their actions and our government's questionable response to domestic terrorism that is taken under martial law. Michael Parks plays the part of the Reverend Abin Cooper with all of the charm and charisma of a narcissistic psychopath and cult leader, making it easy to see how his simpleminded followers could easily be drawn to violence ""in the name of the Lord."" John Goodman is in fine form as well as Joseph Keenan, the leader of the military task force that descends upon Cooper's secluded farmhouse. He stands as the voice of reason against an uncaring government bureaucracy that is only concerned with eliminating the social threat with no care towards collateral damage. The rough filming and raw violence create a sense of ultra-realism on screen, while Smith's cynical sense of humor comes through brilliantly in the script (particularly in Keenan's final debriefing). RED STATE is a thought-provoking thriller, to say the least, and a refreshingly original entry in the genre.

4685935,4,B005FUTBWS,"Kevin Smith's latest film does not feature Jay or Silent Bob, and it's most defiantly not what you're used to seeing from the acclaimed director. Smith not only directed and wrote this film, but he also produced it independently, keeping it out of theaters, but how come? The answer is simple, it's Smith's unique personality and ability to show a film in a context that is as real as possible. Red State is a fictional type story that resembles and mocks the events in Waco. Three High School kids, from a small town, decide to use the internet to find a prostitute. They think they found a bargain, but when they arrived they quickly discovered that all their lives are now in danger. The woman who placed the add, belongs to a religious cult, who owns a compound, where they execute sinners. Michael Parks plays the leader of this group, Abin Copper, and in ever sense of the word he is nothing but brillient! As the pastor with two personalities, a public and private persona, Parks is able to really give us an inside look at what is really going on inside the minds of these people, it really was a great performance. The other standout from this cast is John Goodman, who plays the lead FBI agent in charge, who has to battle his conscious at the same time he's battling Cooper. Red State is a dark and extremely graphic depiction of what life is like in an ultra religious, super conservative environment.

Kevin Smith has returned to his indie roots,a sparky-hazardous return to form. This is his best movie for a long time. Three young horny college boys looking for 3-way internet sex get lured into a honey trap with Melissa Leo,are drugged,tied up by an extremist,homophobic, Christian hate-cult. Mike Parks as the prophet figure Abin Cooper, a brilliant,Phelps-style cult leader,sinister,charismatic,simian who is the father of the inter-related group. The young guys are in cages and witness the killing of a gay man,scary,real. They attempt escape. They are to be made examples of to the congregation. A sense of an outsider anarchy and being out of control in a rapid turn-over of scenes, at the eye of the hurricane is along sermon scene which Parks makes magnetic as he spells out the evils of fornication and sodomy. Smith here and elsewhere does not play it safe,he takes chances. A storm is gathering. John Goodman is fun as the world-weary straight-talikng ATF officer Joe Keenan,who says the remarkable line,"" You said this was going to be simple in and out sir?Simple just s*** itself.""  A chaotic energy ensues as Keenan leads his troops into an ear-splitting Branch Davidian-style shoot-`em up show down. It is violent,thought-provoking and funny. There are great action sequences,no punches are pulled,events are unpredictable and raggedy,issue-based and relevant,a judgement on our world today,a shocking ride through the minefield of middle America. The endingworked extremely well,loud trumpet blares,disarming the surviving congregants as if the Rapture has come. I won't say any more short of saying it's a beautiful wind up!

4685948,4,B005FUTBWS,"It can be a mixed bag when a ""genre"" director makes a foray into a category that he/she has never tried before.  For example, no one is stopping Rob Zombie from making a romantic comedy, but one has to wonder what the success of that film would look like.  Heck, I even wonder what the title would look like - The Devil's Roses?  House of 1,000 Delightful Misunderstandings?

So in March of this year, it was with great intrigue that I attended an advance screening of Kevin Smith's new film, Red State.  Smith is known to both casual movie-goers and his legions of hard-core fans as the comedic mastermind behind cult classics as Clerks, Chasing Amy, Dogma, and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.  But Red State sees Smith take things in a whole new direction, something that can most closely be approximated to the horror genre.  By Smith's own admission, the film isn't exactly a horror flick, but it doesn't really have any other genre to fall into; as he stated during the Q&A session after the Indianapolis filming that I attended, ""there is no `political-social commentary' genre...there are things that happen in the movie that are horrific, so I decided to call it a horror film.""

He is most definitely correct: there are quite horrific moments in the story, enough so that I would agree with him in his categorization of the movie.  In Red State, a group of three teenagers begin the story by agreeing to meet up for a group-sex encounter with an older woman whom they found online.  In typical teenage fashion, they don't do much research (or thinking in general), and the scenario turns out to be a trap concocted by a radical, pseudo-religious, cult-like group, fashioned in this story to appear strikingly similar to the Westboro Baptist Church.

Things up to this point in the story could pass for a ""typical Kevin Smith movie,"" with sex jokes, witty banter, and the like, but things soon take a turn for the seriously-gruesome.  The group's members, led by their fanatical pastor Abin Cooper (played by Michael Parks in typically-awesome Parks-ian fashion), have some truly terrible things planned for the boys, and the unintentional intervention of the local bumbling law enforcement leads to a much bigger confrontation: the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms), who have been watching the ""church"" for some time, show up in full government force, and the standoff at the church's not-surprisingly-well-fortified compound gets bloody quickly.  People die, political rhetoric is spouted in mass amounts on both sides, and the end takes several intriguing turns before settling on the final word via one of Smith's always-well-worded closing statements.

During the post-showing interview session, I asked Smith what he hopes the world will remembers his film's religious message as (even some of his other films, though comedies, also dealt with religious aspects and commentary).  Without missing a beat, he responded confidently with ""Don't fear God, fear His followers.""  Red State certainly embodies that message, and ultimately it's up to the individual viewer if you can agree enough with Smith's opinions to see that message presented effectively in this film.",1353456000,,3192,5.028462998102467
4685949,1,B005FUTBWS,"Red State (Kevin Smith, 2011)

So I finally saw Red State, Kevin Smith's controversial thriller that combines the Fred Phelps cult with the Waco disaster, and I have come to the exact conclusion I expected to: Kevin Smith is as incompetent at making thrillers as he is at making comedies. It's a terrible, terrible movie, which I was expecting--but I will admit, I wasn't expecting it to be terrible in the ways in which it is.

Plot: a crazy-wingnut religious group in Texas, known worldwide for protesting at the funerals of homosexuals (sound familiar?), entraps three youngsters (Sky High`s Michael Angarano, The Perks of Being a Wallflower`s Nicholas Braun, and The Haunting in Connecticut`s Kyle Gallner) with the promise of wild, uninhibited antics with an older woman. This, plus a coincidental sideswipe-and-run accident involving the sheriff of the podunk town where the church has its headquarters), brings the attention of the law on the church's compound, and within hours, the sheriff (No Country for Old Men`s Stephen Root) and a CIA task force headed by Special Agent Joseph Keenan (John Goodman) are parked outside the compound, just waiting for something to happen. And oh, does something happen...

I was going to say ""let's begin with the script"", but in all honesty, every shortcoming this movie has both begins and ends with the script, which is ludicrous. Now, if you follow my reviews at all, you will know that I am not normally the kind of guy that's going to get on a script for gratuitous anything (come on, I'm the guy trying to make the case that porn films should be reviewed just like everything else!), but the amount of profanity in the first five minutes of this script is about the same as one would get in the entire script of most R-rated films. And, SPOILER ALERT: it never cleans up, nice or otherwise. Come on, folks, there's a point at which you go beyond ""gritty realism"" and into the land of ""utterly ridiculous."" (There's a great, great scene in Chris Smith's American Movie where a couple of actors are rehearsing a scene and Mark Borchardt steps in to show them how he thinks it should be done that's been my benchmark for this sort of thing since 1999. Mark Borchardt could have easily written this script...)

Now, pile on top of this a number of long, talky, entirely unnecessary scenes that seem to have been added for the sole purpose of bulking this out into feature-length territory. The first scene inside the church itself, where ultra-bad-guy Abin Cooper (Kill Bill`s Michael Parks) is sermonizing to his flock, goes on at least five minutes longer than it should (and feels like it goes on at least a half-hour more than that). I'm almost willing to cut the movie some slack for its final sequence, which is another completely unnecessary bit (save that it explains the literal deus ex machina in the climax... but the fact that there is a deus ex machina, and that it needs explained afterwards, is a weakness in itself that no filmmaker who has gone beyond Film 101 should be indulging in), because it affords one of the cast's excellent actors--can't tell you who, that's a spoiler--to not only show he still has chops, but that in the hierarchy of really-damned-good actors in this flick, he's still at the top of the food chain, thankyouverymuch. But all the rest of them should have been left on the cutting-room floor. This is a thriller, Mr. Smith. Worse yet, it was originally billed as a horror film. Thankfully, your marketing department saved your behind on that one before it got released...

There are a lot of people here in front of the camera who are very good at what they do. Unfortunately, they are continually sabotaged while attempting to do their best with it. The result is a paceless, plotless mess that I wish I could say could only have been made by Kevin Smith. Unfortunately... *",1353456000,6,3866,4.764179104477612

We should all believe in something is bigger then us,

We should not jump to conclusions,
We should think for ourselves,

We should treat others the way we would want to be treated.

4685954,4,B005FUTBWS,"For years, Kevin Smith's movies have made me cringe. While I liked Clerks and Chasing Amy when I was younger, his other films never did anything for me. I didn't know what it was until just a couple of years ago when it hit me- his characters are just outlets for his speeches/observations. It got annoying enjoying a movie [to an extent] and then suddenly, one of the characters kicks in with some 'witty' speech. Needless to say, I had zero interest when I heard about Red State. Supposedly his last film as a director, and a huge departure from anything he's done before, I still wasn't buying it. But tonight I finally decided to give it a shot, and good lord, I was blown away. There are barely any Kevin-isms in the whole movie, it's a legitimately good thriller, it moves at a good pace, and I enjoyed the resolution, while I usually don't like this kind of finish in other movies. And the best part? None of the usual Smith buddies make forced cameos here!

The plot stats out simple enough- three horned up teen boys meet up with an older woman they meet on a Craigslist-like site. On their way to her home, they hit a car parked on the side of the road, and keep on going because...well, they're teen boys on a mission. When they get to the woman's trailer, she gives them some booze and tells them to go in the other room and undress. As soon as they get in there, they're knocked out and wake up, tied up, in a small church led by pastor Abin Cooper. This guy's so bad, even the skinheads want nothing to do with him. Imagine the Westboro Baptist Church members fused together into one being. That's him! The boys were brought in on the same night a man accused of loving another man is to be executed. The poor guy's been saran wrapped to a cross while a rubber ball in his mouth prevents him from speaking. Things are about to get messy. At the same time, the car that the boys damaged turned out to be the car of a local officer who sends one of his boys to find the car that did it. Guess where the car got moved to. Yep, things are about to get VERY messy.

The story started out simple, and quickly turned into something I wasn't expecting. I've already mentioned how there's nothing 'Kevin Smith' about this movie, so I won't list more reasons why, but it's just such a shocker! Red State looks and feels like it was done by someone else. How is this made by the same guy that made Cop Out? Michael Parks does a fantastic job as Cooper, matching how a lot of crazed religious people are in real life. He has that cool exterior and knows how to pull one's strings to get them motivated and do his work. One thing that got me was how as soon as the boys are brought to the church, they're downgraded to minor characters. This seems to bug a lot of people, but I had no problems with it. They were there to introduce us to the real characters, and they did their job. We may not learn anything about them, yet seeing them scared for their lives while imprisoned, you can't help but want them to make it out alive. John Goodman, who I always enjoy, does a great job here too, as the only other real main character, Agent Keenan. The supporting cast members all do fine as well, though no one else stands out, given that the dialogue is almost entirely shared between Parks and Goodman halfway through the movie.

I don't want to ruin any of the surprises that happen after the first portion of the movie, so I'll avoid talking about the second half. Again, I was pleasantly surprised at what takes place. It's been a long time since someone's death surprised me in a movie, and Red State managed to surprise me on more than one occasion. They weren't jaw-dropping scenes by any means, but it was how suddenly and unexpectedly they happened. Most of the time it's obvious when someone's about to get killed off. Here? Not so much. Red State also surprised me by not being a big anti-religious mess like many other similar films. Smith isn't saying anything bad about Christianity here- it's obvious from the beginning that Cooper's people are loopy. We've all seen people like this before, and nothing is over exaggerated.

There was -one- point early on where I thought Red State was going to lose me. It was when the boys awake in Cooper's church and he goes off about the heathens and everything wrong with the world today. The scene wasn't bad, just a little too long for my tastes before it got moving along. But hey, isn't that how it is at church most of the time? I'd be lying if I said I wasn't letting my mind wander during this bit. It's still an ok scene, and serves its purpose- to show how dedicated Cooper is to what he thinks is doing God's work.

Red State...a movie so surprisingly good that it almost clears Smith for Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. I actually hope he directs one or two more movies that aren't like his usual schtick now. Good job Smith.",1349654400,,4888,4.355263157894737
4685955,2,B005FUTBWS,"Three young men find an online dating site where an older woman is propositioning guys for sex. But the advert is a trap, and they find themselves prisoners of a fundamentalist Christian cult who are trying to purge the world of what they see as amorality brought about by sexual permissiveness and tolerance. When their activities draw the attention of law enforcement officials, the stage is set for a violent confrontation.

Kevin Smith is best-known for his string of comedic movies based on pop culture and lowbrow humour: Clerks, Mallrats, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and so on. He is also known for his interest in religion and theological debates, which, combined with humour, have formed the basis for arguably his most interesting movie to date, Dogma. Red State marks Smith's return to examining religion but this time around there are no laughs: the film is a straight-up drama.

After almost twenty years spent making comedies, it's good to see Smith trying out new ideas and breaking new ground for himself as a film-maker. It's such a shame then that Red State is a flat-out mess of a film. Many of the movie's weaknesses are also present in Smith's earlier films, but comedies tend to be much more forgiving of long run-on scenes and structural imperfections. Dramas, especially those with an undercurrent of psychological horror, are much less tolerant of such issues.

This problem can best be summed up by the movie's first half-hour. In the first fifteen minutes we are introduced to our three main characters, about whom we virtually learn nothing at all. Aside from their physical appearances, they are interchangeable and do nothing to attract our sympathy or interest. These scenes also establish the presence of a fundamentalist nutjob community in the town, that the town's sheriff has some personal problems and that these three guys are obsessed with sex. The following fifteen minutes form one, incredibly long and tedious scene in which the film's antagonist rants on against the evils plaguing America. Because of this John Goodman, the movie's biggest name, doesn't even show up until halfway through the picture.

The initial half of the film plays around with the ideas of psychological horror, such as the idea of the three prisoners being tortured or forced to watch the execution of other captives. But Smith doesn't have the patience for this and it isn't long before he ditches the idea in favour of a massive Waco-style shoot-out. Any attempt to engage seriously with the issues raised by the film are thrown out the window the second the shotguns and machine guns start being handed out and it isn't long before we are in the middle of what feels like the longest siege scene in American film history. Because of the failure to set up the action scenes in more depth, they also feel rather trite and manipulative, with Smith borrowing the visual imagery of religious cults and sieges such as Waco without actually engaging with them in any substantive way.

The movie does shine a few times: Goodman is great as normal and gets the best characterisation in the movie. Michael Parks is also excellent as the antagonist preacher leading the cult, even selling some of the worst-written scenes and dialogue in the movie. Kerry Bishe isn't given a lot to work with as the preacher's morally-divided daughter, but gives a solid performance as well. Pretty much everyone else in the film is forgettable. The script has potential, but is overwritten with dialogue scenes that go on for far too long after their point is made.

Smith does attempt to introduce some moral complexity to the film by shining a light on the dubious activities of the American government in dealing with terrorism, but again in such a ham-fisted way that it comes off as both crushingly obvious and an excuse for more shoot-outs and deaths. And the less said about the ludicrous ending, the better.

Red State (**) shows Kevin Smith trying something new in his career, which is laudable, and also has a few good performances and ideas in it. However, it is also not very well-written, its structure and pacing is shot to hell and the serious issues it attempts to raise come across as paper-thin excuses for scenes of violent carnage. The film teeters on the edge of exploiting real, serious and tragic news stories for cheap thrills, which I am certain was not the director's intention.",1348963200,12,4401,4.89142091152815

**Some Spoilers**

Three teen boys answer a craigslist type sex ad to get it on with what turns out to be a much older woman.  The woman gives them a couple beers each which turn out to be laced with the date rape drug - roofies.  When they wake up from the haze much later, one is tied up in a cage, another plastic wrapped to a cross and a couple others are locked in a basement in a fundamentalist church.

I won't tell you what happens, but they are captured by a really sinister and destructive church.  Some feel they were mirrored off of the equally vile church group out there in real life called the Westboro Church in Kansas.  Although that church is mentioned in the movie, this church is supposedly ten times worse if that's even possible.  They take it upon themselves to commit crimes and use the reasoning as ""they're doing God's work.""

The movie is a borderline horror and it is exploitive, but in a necessary way.  I didn't give it 5 stars as the last 15-30 minutes took it in a direction that became outlandish.

A huge departure from comedy styling's of Kevin Smith, but ultimately, a decent one.  A top performance from Michael Parks as the cult leader and some genially surprising moments make this one worth seeing. Might make you think twice about online dating.

Ever since Matthew Shepard was killed, I've waited for someone to slap this group across the face and show how warped they really are, even inadverdently.

Some readers may think I'm giving Kevin Smith too much credit here, but let me clarify something for you: I do know the WBC didn't kill Matthew Shepard, but everyone knows what they do and did at his and over a dozen other funerals, and unless you truly believes he's right, free speech protection or not, it saddens and infuriates me that the public not only tolerates them, but also, the news has the gull to give them undeserved attention! Why is this? If we ignore them, they might go away!
Enough with the rant, now to the review. Dogma and Red State are now my two favorite Kevin Smith movies. The cast is very well chosen, Michael Parks as the villianous pastor, was incredible, John Goodman was very good as the agent trying to diffuse the situation, the rest of the young cast was pretty good too, but don't forget Melissa Leo either.

4685970,4,B005FUTBWS,"Kevin Smith movies suck.

As someone who is reading this review, or has reviewed films in the past, you can probably find a better word to use to elaborate my point.  As a formidable teen in the 90s, nothing impressed me more than garage films that were funny, realistic, and jarring all at the same time.  Clerks fit that bill.  In fact, it still fits that bill whenever I feel the urge to time travel back to a place where cinema was better and creativity soared higher in Hollywood than today.  Wunderkind Smith crafted a voice of a generation with this singular film, and since its release in 1994 has tried again and again to recreate that talent.  Within the 17 other films he has directed since Clerks, only two have attempted to come close to the excitement that Randal and Dante held.  Personally, those are Chasing Amy and the more recent Zack & Miri Make a Porno (though I credit this more towards the humor of Seth Rogan than Smith's direction), but now I may find myself putting Red State within this elitist mix.

(As an aside, I did love Clerks: The Animated Series, but I didn't want to confuse the reader)

Before mass hysteria pertaining to this comment, allow me to validate my point.  Coming off the treacherous Cop Out (which had to be turned off early due to utter embarrassment), hesitation rang supreme as I put in the Blu-ray version of Smith's latest outing.  I recall hearing that he decided to distribute this himself, which continued to bode unwell as I hit play on the title screen.  Then, the drops of piano notes hit - and my mind sunk in.  Red State is a film about the power of religion, the horrors of fear, and chaotic representation of terrorism.  It is about Five Points Church, their preacher Albin Cooper, the eradication of ""sin"", and those caught in the crossfire.  Sex-crazed teens, a cache of weapons, and a detailed work-oriented John Goodman round out the rest of the plot to this film, which honestly, is the weakest part of Red State. Smith begins our film with what feels like the beginning of the third act, and he is not afraid to keep us focused on that direction.  As our teens fall prey to a petty sting operation set up by Cooper and his congregation, the rest of the movie is set either trying to escape or eradicate.  This is where Smith surprised me.

Red State is not a creative film.  Watching it unfold with blood, bullets, and a high body count - one cannot help but see that Smith is merely invading the space that friends Tarantino or Rodriguez already dominate.  Through the shower of carnage and Goodman's screams, one cannot help but see the ghost of Grindhouse past, or any of the more recent torture-porn semi-horror releases.  Yet, as a viewer of all of his epic fails, there is some finesse to Smith's camera.  Horror may even be the wrong genre all together.  He dabbles between the lines of comic and sheer shock, and is successful.  His choice of casting is among the best I have seen in a long time, eerily reminiscent of a Cohen production, Michael Park's Albin Cooper has been grandly ushered into the world of horror genius/villain.  I could, and would have loved, to watch a full two hours of him merely giving sermons or asking for tea.  An actor is only as good as the man giving him the direction, so to credit Park, I must also say that Smith's eye was not dull on this count.  The same can be said for Stephen Root (giving a small, but nuanced performance of a sexually-conflicted sheriff), John Goodman surprising me completely as an Agent trying to do his best amongst erupted chaos, and Melissa Leo countering Park around every turn, giving yet another dirty, grunge performance.  It is these characters - these actors playing these characters - that build Red State into something stronger than anticipated.

Red State will never have the shelf longevity of Clerks, nor will it appeal to most audiences as our taste of Smith has dwindled over the years.  BUT, there was something unique about this film that continued to pine in my mind.  I enjoyed Smith's juxtaposition between Goodman's orders and that Cooper felt he was receiving from the Lord.  Stagnant plot holes aside, the scenes were beautifully developed and choreographed.  I especially liked that the arsenal room had a cross light hanging from the ceiling.  The final scene with the horn was a small twist that left a smile on my face, and questioned why Smith hadn't painted with such detail since 1994.  Michael Park deserves an award; even an MTV Award will do, and if anything see Red State for merely the actors that inhabit the idiot box for the hour and a half.  A small, insignificant glimmer of hope will appear to those that dreamed of a triumphant Smith cinematic return.

Then, like this viewer typing this today, we will accidentally turn to the ""Making of..."" on the same disc; hear Smith discuss why he made this film - and with shattered hope return to the original idea:

For better or worse, Smith took his show on the road, setting up one-off screenings and making the film available via video on demand back in September. The story centers on a small town with a religious cult that bears a striking resemblance to the Westboro Baptist Church; when three teens are lured by the promise of sex into a trap set by the film's fictional Five Points Church, the town's police and the ATF get involved, resulting in a Waco-style showdown at the church's compound.

4685976,3,B005FUTBWS,"Warning: May contain Spoilers

Red State begins like your run-of-the-mill abduction/slasher picture. A group of rowdy, sex-fiending teens embark on a quest through the backwoods after discovering a woman willing to pleasure them all simultaneously on a Craigslist-esque website rife with pictures of half-nude women from exotic places like New York or LA. This particular woman, however, the boys soon learn, is not a bodacious dream girl, but a member of a deranged and evangelic religious group who have been periodically abducting and murdering gay folks for the past few weeks. This brings Red State about to the twenty minute mark. Around this time, the leader of the group, a charismatic zealot freak, delivers an especially long sermon then orders his goons to execute someone unrelated to the plot. Soon after, thanks to a coincidental run-in with a gay walking plot device (played by an amiable, blundering Stephen Root) earlier in the film, the police arrive to investigate the zealot's compound. Many, many AK-47s are fired. The stream of profanity that carried the kids through the movie's first act is lessened somewhat and...oh, right-- Enter John Goodman. Goodman's by-the-numbers ATF role is quite enjoyable and realistic and yet, the man looks awful. He limps around, perhaps from an earlier injury that is never explained. His moobs are ginormous and his face is incredibly sallow. Nevertheless, he is convincing and a perfect counterpart to the ridiculous preacher. The rest of the actors are fairly good at their roles and the gore effects (mostly consisting of bloody gunshot wounds) are pretty typical but well-done, the exception being a terrible CGI headshot. Ultimately, Red State is a social commentary on the effects of believers v. non-believers and the convictions that drive both sides--sometimes into lunacy. The movie retains some of Kevin Smith's self-conscious wit, name-dropping The West Burrow Baptist Church at one point, knowing full-well the audience will have already drawn this parallel.
The second half of the film is dominated by a large-scale shoot-out which is very well done. Frenetic and bloody, this action set-piece is reminiscent of the siege of the Firefly homestead in Rob Zombie's newish classic The Devil's Rejects. While admittedly entertaining, the shoot-out marks the film's jump from the horror element of the first half hour into decidedly action flick territory. This is not necessarily a bad thing, though it is jarring.
 Red State is, when the smoke clears, the mark of a low-budget provocateur. It is technically competent and never flashy, but by the same token, there were hardly any moments (aside from John Goodman's electrifying delivery and one fairly brutal execution) that set it apart from other genre fare. Worth a watch to see Kevin Smith succeeding in unfamiliar territory, there is the implicit understanding that without a Hollywood name at the helm, Red State may have been just another socially-conscious B flick relegated to the $5 Wal-Mart bin, where it indeed may show up sometime in the next six months. For $5, however, it would be a steal, a holy crime to pass up.",1323216000,2,3149,5.18467583497053

That's the only way to explain RED STATE, the latest film from Kevin Smith.  A film we won't be seeing at a theatre near you.  A film that doesn't have one believable scene in it.  A film without a single sympathetic character in situations where we might care whether they survive or not.

By calling his film RED STATE and focusing on a sect of religious lunatics, Smith is clearly pandering to the political landscape of Hollywood, picking on the rubes and playing every stereotype he can exploit.  But his writing is still limited and juvenile.  Seasoned FBI Agents talk with the same uneducated dialogue as the stupid, horny teenagers.  Religious zealots end up cursing like stupid, horny teenagers.  In fact, everyone, as usual, ends up talking like Kevin Smith...or how he thinks they should talk while saddled with the vocabulary and thought processess of stupid, horny teenagers.

Unfortunately, Smith ends up equating the FBI with the religious fanatics.  Does Smith honestly believe that phone calls are made from Washington telling Field Agents to slaughter everyone at a hostage situation, including women and children, just to keep things quiet?  What a muddled mess of legal procedures clutter the second half of this movie!

Before watching this film tonight, I saw an article in the press where Smith trashed the Independent Spirit Awards in a profanity-laced tirade via Twitter because RED STATE wasn't nominated for anything.  I'm guessing he's the only one surprised by this.

These two reviewers were oogling over it as though it had been their most profound moving-going experience in decades.  That is the LAST time I take any of their recommendations.

I guess I must have seen the ""Holy God This Sucks"" edit of Red State, as most others seemed to really like it.  I thought this movie was horrible.  It ranks right up at the top of my ""Thanks-I'll-Never-Get-That-Time-Back"" list with ""Wanted"", ""Fast and the Furious"", and ""Paranormal Activity"" as total and utter wastes of my life.  And, honestly, it is WORSE than those three horrible pieces of film trash because it was supposed to be some ""psychological thriller"" or ""horror film"" to be taken seriously by critics and audiences alike.  Honestly...it's angering what a disappointing waste this movie was.

First off, it was absolutely predictable from beginning to end.  If you read any basic synopsis then watch for about five minutes, you can pretty much figure out what will happen.  Oh, wait...the BIG shocker was the trumpets playing.  Yay.

How is this a horror film?  Brazen acts of murder do not make it a horror film, nor do they make it a ""psychological thriller"".  Remember ""Seven""?  THAT was a psychological thriller.  The ""scariest"" part of Red State was having to sit through about 10 minutes of crazy preacher man's sermon.  I felt like I was back in parochial school, suffering through another mindless endless lecture (although I was fortunate enough to not hear it through a covered dog cage).

I love Kevin Smith.  His earlier works are some of my all-time favorite movies.  I watched this piece of crap from beginning to end, having faith that such a brilliant person would pull it together in the end and make it all worthwhile.  Alas, he did not.  Again...shocking...angering.  Maybe that was the ""psychological twist"":  You watch the movie then realize how much time you wasted, then you feel shocked that Kevin Smith actually had a hand in this, and finally are angry that he'd put his name to such a thing.  He took some random thoughts, headlines, and conspiracy theories, put them in a Cuisinart, vomited them into a pail and threw it onto the screen.

This is not ground-breaking.  This is not thought-provoking or moving.  It doesn't scare you into thinking ""oooohhh, what does our government REALLY do"".  It just makes you think, ""Hmm.

4685983,4,B005FUTBWS,"Spoilers ahead.  Director Kevin Smith makes a wide departure from what we can usually expect from his indi-films with this far out quasi-religious expose.  Take one part comedy about teen boy hormones, one part teen horror, one part psycho-thriller, one part drama and one part preachy politics and mix thoroughly.  That covers most of the available bases and Smith does it pretty effectively.  Three horny teenagers decide to look up a woman they find on-line who agrees to have sex with them all at the same time.  On the way there they argue about who gets what body orifice (yeah pretty disgusting and funny at the same time).  After they arrive they are drugged and taken to a church outside of town where a preacher (very scary, very effective Michael Parks) holds them captive for a later killing ""in the name of God"".  This is one of those preachers who pickets funerals of soldiers, gays and other minorities.  As someone says ""even the Nazis have disavowed them.""  In reality although a true believer, he and his minions are also armed to the teeth and ready for battle.  A local sheriff (Stephen Root) learns of the kidnapping by way of a ridiculous subplot and calls in the ATF.  The local office is run by John Goodman.  Through a comedy of errors, a decision is made to wipe out the church leaving no survivors so as not to have witnesses of the mistakes.  This includes the hostages and small children.  Smith pulls no punches and there is genuine tension as the 3 boys attempt their escape.  The resulting gun battles feel damn real and they are quite violent.  He also doesn't exempt likeable characters from getting wacked.  ""Red State"" is an out of the ordinary thriller with a small budget.  It's not for everyone but I thought it to be very effective.

This is quite a good thing, as it leaves room for a more chilling psychological journey. I found the religious zealots to be quite scary, and of course, John Goodman's acting as a Gov't official was superb!

Michael Parks is astounding.  He's doing better work than ever, and maintains a spark and originality.  That he's been largely overlooked during the last several decades is a crime.  John Goodman's character is locked into a no-win situation.  You can see him collapsing into himself, and yet bulling his way through to carrying out the mission.  Both of these actors deserve Oscar nominations, as does the movie itself.

This a totally new direction for Kevin Smith.  It's shot documentary-style which doesn't feel at all affected.  The acting is naturalistic, unlike the intentional `stagy' acting in Smith's comedies.

Red State revolves around three high school guys that are lured into a trap with the promise of sex over the internet, only to find themselves trapped by an extreme Christian fundamentalist group (led by the great Michael Parks who channels Westboro Baptist Church-leading hate monger Fred Phelps) that have plans that no one around sees coming.  What helps make Red State so good is the fact that it fully displays that Kevin Smith has matured technically as a filmmaker.  The action and suspense scenes are taut and well-executed, and are made all the better thanks to the well-chosen cast, which also includes recent Oscar winner Melissa Leo and John Goodman as an ATF agent that shines in the film's climactic showdown.

This has been described as Smith's ""horror"" film.  I definitely wouldn't place this in the horror genre-suspense I guess is more accurate.
I won't rehash the plot because I'm working under the assumption that everyone pretty much knows it anyhow.  Yes, it starts off like Hostel and winds up being a kind of reverse Assault On Precinct 13.
It's not the most original of plots, as it's scrapped together from bits of various torture porn and hostage and siege films, but Smith does manage to put a personal stamp on it.  Folks have said that Smith has messages and commentaries on society, religion, law enforcement and whatnot here, but honestly I don't see any.  It's just a fast paced thriller to me.  Having the villains as a crazy religious cult(think Westboro Ministry with guns) may seen like grounds for some kind of ""message"", but I think crazy religious folks just make for creepy and realistic villains.  Hell, that was the whole premise of Children of the Corn.  This cult however views homosexuals primarily as Satan's tools, and like to lure them to the church for murder.  Oddly enough, our protagonists/victims are not homosexuals, making the whole point kind of moot.  The three boys are lured to the church under the impression that they will be triple teaming a woman they met online.
A little sidenote here-To me, this is the icky part of the film, as I personally find it quite grotesque for three guys to be nailing a woman at the same time.  You'd certainly never find me in threesome with another guy, let alone a three pee-pee party.  What the hell's the point in that??  But these three guys are more than happy to do just that...and with an unattractive older woman too!
Anyway, back on track here.  I figured that if these zealots were targeting homosexuals that they would lure homosexuals through a fake sex ad for gay men.  Oh, well.  Parks' character has his justifications either way.
Speaking of Parks, he's pretty good.  I'm kinda biased as I've liked him since first seeing him as one of the main villains in Twin Peaks back in the day.  I did like John Goodman as the FBI agent in charge of the raid on the cult's compound.  I'm not sure if the FBI would actually order everyone to be killed, but I'm not in the FBI and the FBI certainly wouldn't truthfully answer if you were to ask them if they would really do that.  So, who knows?
All in all I liked the movie, but what really dragged it down for me is Smith's decision to film this movie in the same annoying style as many torture porn films of our time.  That is to say that the movie is overly gray looking and full of shakey, skipping, jarring camerawork.  Why in the hell do they keep doing this in movies??  Do people really think that looks cool or something?  Does it highten the suspense and make it all the more scarier?  Does anybody but me realize how tacky that looks, and how it robs the movie of any bit of realism it could possibly have by making it resemble a music video?  Hell, I might as well stop whining about it as it seems like it will never go away.  It's just odd that Smith, who's comedies were unconventional, would take such a bandwagon approach to the look of this movie.  To his credit though, it is thankfully not overused the way many films do it.  But basically this is the only reason for the three star rating instead of a four.
Like I said, I did enjoy it.  It zipped by quick and held me the whole time.  I certainly don't rank it as one of the most pulse pounding films of all time, but in a day of countless remakes, rehashes, reboots, prequels, choose your euphemism for ""unoriginal crap"", this was a nice breath of fresh air.",1320278400,,3838,4.518840579710145

What is most disturbing though is that in the movie the government feels that even after Waco that it is alright to kill every man woman and child to cover up a blunder, or worse, just because they feel like it.  There is nothing gray area about that.  I really hope that there are no ATF agents like those portrayed and I really hope that the patriot act is not being, or can't be used like it is in the movie.",1320105600,2,577,4.247706422018348

Three high schoolers venture into the woods, thinking they're going to ""get some,"" but they end up getting more than they bargained for. Religious fanatics tie them up and put them in cages.

I thought the beginning was very compelling, and I thought I knew where it was going, which had me wincing. But I was totally wrong. There is no real protagonist, and the story shifts focus about half-way through (which is sad, because I was much more interested in the goings-on inside the church) I was confused about one thing. The religious fanatics obviously had an issue with homosexuals... so why did they cage the 3 boys who were responding to an offer for heterosexual sex? Oh well.

4685992,5,B005FUTBWS,"I like Kevin Smith well enough but I'm not a fanboy. I always considered him a better writer than director and he's had a few stinkers (as have most directors) in his career. This is definitely not a stinker.

Here's the scoop. Three young men are lured, with the promise of sex, to a trailer. Instead of sex, they are drugged, captured and the soon to become fodder for the wrath of a whacked, cult-type preacher/ survivalist. Through a fluke, the ATF gets involved and the whole situation escalates to a Wacco style standoff.

There is no way to guess this is a Kevin Smith film at a glance. The plotting is more intricate and the directing is more fluid. I simply could not believe what I was seeing. I liked the way the story unfolded. I didn't at all find it forced. It was also very good at depicting the subtleties of the situation. Yes. Some of the church members were whacked, but when the doo-doo hit the fan others realized the gravity of the situation and wanted out. The ATF members were also a mixed bunch. Many were not quick to be all gung-ho due to the fact that young children were involved.

John Goodman, as the beleaguered ATF team leader, was outstanding. Michael Parks, as the head preacher, was equally as good. The young boys were all believable and many of the church members made my skin crawl. This is a horrible, but believable situation. It is not difficult to see how a situation like this can escalate and get out of control. Smith is beyond himself as a director here. He sets his shots up way better than I've seen in any of his other films. All the other production values were in line with the story. Nothing too elaborate, but nothing stripped down so you see the bones.

I'm very hesitant to give a movie 5 stars because I can (and have) gotten so involved in a film while watching it that I don't see it's weak points. That may be the case here but I'm giving it the big 5 anyway.",1319673600,,1919,4.366946778711484
4685993,5,B005FUTBWS,"Red State is not what the generation of today consider a horror movie.  These are the ones who are whining and complaining that this isn't horror.  Before the late 70s, the horror/thriller/chiller genre was all about getting into your mind and terrifying you.  This movie does just that.

A truthful take on the fundamentalist right AND the behavior of the government, this film is just shot after shot of brutal reality.  Michael Parks as the Fred Phelp's-ish pastor is so scary just by dialogue alone, that he can talk for about 12 minutes straight, with no sort of action, and you are already shaking in fear.  Kevin Smith was always known as a dialogue man and he does NOT disappoint in this masterpiece.  He has certainly matured as a writer/director, mixing his own brand of snarky humor with the display of two equally sick organizations: The Christian Right and the police.

The ATF/cops in this film are bone-chillingly scary as well.  They barely hesitate or question to follow the most dastardly of orders by their sick and twisted superiors who seem to be above the constitution.  This films shows the Patriot Act for what it is...a horrifying ""Get-Out-Of-Jail-free card"" started by sick individuals.  John Goodman is outstanding as federal agent, Keenan...programmed to do whatever he is told, but sickened by every moment of it.  Just phenomenal.

David Klein's cinematography is just heart-wrenchingly awesome.  This filmwork does not take the route of these horrible torture porn/slasher ""horror"" movies of today.  Every shot was obviously carefully delivered and edited.  You can tell that Smith worked on the editing with care...every cut has meaning and is used to move the story, not just appeasing the post MTV generation an average of 3 seconds per shot.  Smith is not afraid to hold on a performance and let the audience sink into this very-real and dark world.

Thank you Kevin Smith, for showing the world what is happening right before our eyes with mostly your own money no less.  This is an amazing piece of celluloid and should be referenced 200 years from now in ""History of Film"" books.

4685994,4,B005FUTBWS,"First off, I admit to being thrown off my game by this type of film coming from the pen and imagination of Kevin Smith, but this social commentary/thriller doesn't disappoint.

My complaints are few and far between, but enough to justify deleting a star.  Michael Parks- in the performance of a career- chews up the scenery with a malevolent and totally believable preacher gone mad.  Other than Smith's tendency to let Parks' character occasionally engage in mumble-speak, it's spot on and frighteningly controlled.  If this wasn't a Smith film the performance would garner Oscar consideration.

Unlike many other Smith films the dialog was under control and focused- only straying during opening sequences where the boys engage in an excessively foul mouthed dialog which supposedly sets up their encounter with the faux prostitute.  Even the ATF sequence and subsequent inquisition of the Goodman character were believable and restrained.

Two cinematography complaints- the use of head attached cameras during ""flight sequences"" and the sharp cutting during same.  It's as if Smith felt the need to stylistically insert his imprint on the film, but both techniques were distracting and failed to advance the terror factor inherent in the film.

Over all, RED STATE was well acted and directed, and had a good, cogent story.  Contrary to those who feel this was Kevin Smith going Michael Moore in his pursuit of a particular social agenda, I didn't feel a heavy hand at work here.  The characters and the story are so chillingly believable that they overcame whatever biases Smith may have brought to the table.",1319500800,2,1614,5.145593869731801

4685996,3,B005FUTBWS,"I watched the movie Red State and my quotes from the movie are approximate, sorry if I get it wrong.

The movie was generally okay, a lot of the F word, and some pretty graphic descriptions of sex acts early on.

Overview of plot:
There is a funeral with the Cooper Cult protesting.  Lots of protest signs similar to the ones at  military funerals.  A teen, Travis, and his mom, pass the funeral on the way to school.

At school the teacher speaks a bit about the cult, saying ""the ultra right wing shuns them and even the neo-nazis say those guys are nucking futs.""  After class Travis and 2 teens discuss seeking a prostitute online.......

They find one in the nearby town, and go to visit her.  On they way they clip a car parked on the side of the road (the local sheriff and another man in a sex act in that parked car).

The prostitute gets the teens to drink some beers, and they are drugged and taken to the cults compound.  The prostitute was the cult leaders daughter ""catching insects on the web.""  The cult has been killing ""sinners"" by wrapping them in cellophane and then shooting then on the top of the head.  Graphic torture sequences......hand gun hidden in hollowed out Bible.

There is a long ""sermon"" from Cooper, which does accurately portray some real life cultists.  It is kind of hard to stomach listening to that crap and its perversion of the Gospel.  About 20 people in the cult, about a half dozen children, all offspring of the cult leader.  The cult leader says his grandfather started the cult, then his dad, and now it is him.......

During the service, a deputy drives by and sees the car which had hit the sheriff's car.  He gets shot to death by a cultist, and the leader of the cult speaks on the police radio to the sheriff and threatens to send photos of the sheriff and his gay lover to the sheriff's wife.  The sheriff calls ATF Agent Keenan (John Goodman does the acting, and his is the only decent acting in the movie).

Back at the service.....
Travis watches, from the cage, a murder on the alter, and the other teens are bound under a trap door in the floor.  The murdered man is dropped into the trap door.  One of his bones breaks and allows the bound teens to cut they way loose.

The cultists discover the teens have escaped, and one has run into the armory in the basement of the compound.  A shootout happens, and one cultist is killed.  The cult morns the loss of this member, but they have been celebrating the murdering of the ""sinners.""  That is a powerful image.....

ATF comes to arrest the cultists.  Agent Keenan discusses the cultists on the phone with a supervisor, and explicitly says, ""No it is not the Fred Phelps people up in Kansas, they are just sayers, these are doers""

So now the cult is kind of in the same vein as David Koresh and Waco.....

A big firefight happens, Agent Keenan gets orders to kill everyone in the compound.  One of the cult daughters tries to get the children out without being killed.

Then the trumpets ring.............

There is more, but it would be too much of a spoiler.

Pros:
Accurate portrayal of cultist activities.
Made me ponder value of human life, and the essentials of understanding that the New Testament supersedes the Old Testament.
Thought provoking ending.

Cons:  Poor acting by most characters.  John Goodman is an exception.  Graphic language.  Graphic violence.  Jumbled plot and some holes in time sequences.  Did not come off as plausible, and the ending is ""unusual"" (I could not find a better word.",1319414400,3,3519,4.529411764705882
4685997,3,B005FUTBWS,"I'm a pretty big Kevin Smith fan, and it's nice to see him try something different. Unfortunately, it seems like he had at least three separate ideas for a non-comedy: a commentary on religious extremism, a commentary on The Evil Government, and just another entry in the grainy, dark, torture porn genre (Saw, Hostel, Vacancy, etc). The result was kind of a muddle in which a few truly memorable elements are almost completely lost.

[Warning! Spoilers]

We start out as three horny high school boys set off to have sex with an older woman whom one of them has met on the internet. Before you can say ""MILF"", they are drugged and find themselves captives of the local religious crazies. This is group is so obviously modeled on the Westboro Baptist Church, that Smith goes out of his way to establish that they are *not* the WBC - presumably because he knows that group's fondness for litigation.

The church has the incestuous structure and obsession with homosexuality of the WBC, combined with Branch Davidians' love of artillery. It becomes clear they are going to sacrifice our teenage Romeos as part of...well, we're never quite sure; they *are* crazy, after all. Deaths involve a cross, a ball gag, and cellophane, so when they simply shoot their victims at the end, it's kind of anticlimactic.

A bloody encounter with a local deputy brings in the ATF, and this is where the movie really starts to run off the rails. It seems that the ATF is still smarting from Waco, but has decided that the *real* mistake was leaving witnesses, so they are given orders to kill everyone and plant evidence of a terrorist plot. After a passionate argument against this, the lead agent (John Goodman) falls in line and bullies his subordinates to do the same. Sorry, I just couldn't swallow this.

Now we're not sure who to root for as we start to feel sorry for the religious nuts. The last of our three horny protagonists is dispatched by the ATF, but by this time we've long since forgotten the original story line anyway.

Just when he seems to have written himself into a blood soaked corner, Smith does manage to wrap it up with a genuinely cool and unique plot element, which I'll leave out here, and we're reminded that this could have been a very good movie.

Unquestionably, the one truly great thing in the movie is Michael Parks as Not-Fred-Phelps, the leader of religious brood. His perfect combination of charisma and menace is literally Oscar quality, and when he's on the screen, you forget all the movie's flaws. Melissa Leo does a pretty good job as Not-Shirley-Phelps-Roper, his daughter, although she overdoes it a bit at some points. I don't know if it's the strain of kicking the booze, or the weight loss, but John Goodman comes across to me as kind of shaky and frail.

4686002,2,B005FUTBWS,"Red State is Kevin Smith's attempt at roasting religious fundamentalism and the ATF alike. As an attempt at the horror/thriller genre, Red State falls flat. As an attempt at thriller/action, Red State falls flat. As an attempt at horror/thriller/action/comedy, Red State falls flat. The horror of the movie is eclipsed by its real world equivalent. The action was scripted by someone who doesn't understand how government law enforcement agencies operate or how firearms are properly used. The comedy is infrequent and lacks the wit of Smith's earlier films. Red State is a frankenstein monster of genres, mashed up into one low budget exploitation film.

The Horror: At its heart, Red State is a horror film focusing on a fundamentalist Christian group. The novel starts out with three horny high school kids looking to get laid. The three receive an online invitation for sex that turns out to be a trap set by the religious nut jobs. Standard ""stupid teenager"" plot device aside, I felt like the setup had plenty of potential. There are so many real world examples of religious extremism that Kevin Smith should have had no trouble crafting a truly chilling thriller. The Five Points church is obviously a fusion of the Westboro Baptist Church and the Branch Davidians, made famous by the Waco siege. The trouble is, Kevin Smith's Five Pointers aren't all that original or scary. The group consists of a bunch of bigots lead by Pastor Abin Cooper, supreme bigot. These are the people that picket funerals with offensive chants and self-righteous bs. But when Abin Cooper steps up the pulpit during a nightly service and delivers a fire and brimstone sermon I couldn't help but feel bored when I know I should have felt aghast. The sermon (followed by the execution which actually was horrifying) was uninspired. I've heard sermons like that before. In movies and in real life. I've heard End Times sermons far more terrifying, spoken with far more conviction. Abin may have charisma, but lacked the necessary gravitas to pull off a dangerous religious nutjob. Real life is often scarier than the movies we watch, but the Five Pointers are a lazy imitation of the Westboro Baptists and the Branch Davidians.

The Action: After an escape attempt by the horny teenagers, the ATF becomes involved and any of the thin layer of creepy that existed vanishes abruptly. At this point the movie becomes a half baked copy of the Waco siege. The Five Pointers and the ATF get into a gun fight (almost immediately after the ATF arrive) and from there the movie becomes a rather lame siege. You can tell by the way the ATF agents act and move that little to no research was invested in giving an accurate performance. Honestly it's a miracle (pun intended) that they didn't all get slaughtered at the beginning when they were clustered around the main gate of the Church compound. The aspect that made the Waco siege so gripping and shocking was the sheer amount of tension built up over the course of fifty days. There is no tension or build up to be found in Red State. The one thing I do have to commend Kevin Smith for is showing both sides of the event. Most people believe that the ATF and FBI were seriously at fault with their execution of the Waco siege and that belief is also apparent here in Red State. The ATF in Red State are almost as villainous as the Five Pointers, killing unarmed civilians by that old evil excuse ""just following orders."" Of course, this is over done and so the impact is minimal. Like I mentioned above in the section titled ""Horror,"" this is another case of fact being scarier than fiction.

The Comedy: Kevin Smith is perhaps best known for his cult classic Clerks movies, as well as his portrayal of Silent Bob. Kevin Smith movies tend to have a real world sense of humor that packs an enormous punch because of its witty cynicism. That same humor is absent in Red State. As a horror movie you wouldn't expect a great deal of comedy and that would be a fair assumption. That said you can see where Smith tries to inject humor into the mixture but these moments fail to carry any amount of levity to the atmosphere. There is one bit at the end where the Special Agent in Charge explains the nature of the ""heavenly trumpets"" that I laughed pretty heartily at but that seemed to be the height of comedy in Red State.

Red State is a genre mashup, and an effort by Kevin Smith to produce a unique horror film. As such Red State is a fail. For anyone interested in a clash between religious nutjob fundamentalists and government agencies acting with negligent abandon I suggest watching the documentary WACO: The Rules of Engagement. For anyone interested in a religious slasher I suggest Frailty with Bill Paxton and Matthew McConaughey.

Even if you have no interest whatsoever in the content or plot (which is well done), the performances alone are worth watching over and over again. Michael Parks and Melissa Leo give truly amazing performances, but it doesn't stop there. Stephen Root and John Goodman are also incredible, and the younger actors are certainly worth watching (especially Kerry Bishe and Kyle Gallner).

Some have complained that it shifts around too much, but I think Kevin Smith got it just right (there is a method to his madness). It shocks, but at exactly the right times, and I found the ""sudden shifts"" that some found disconcerting add to the story line and entertainment value. The camera work is off the charts and the shoot-em-up scenes struck me as a mix of the very best of the surreal quality of Tarantino and the hard-nosed reality of Spielberg (as in Private Ryan).

In some spots the film approaches the lines of believability, as Kevin Smith is known for, but does not cross it..remaining right there on that edge, often pulling back momentarily.

His horror/thriller RED STATE isn't quite as potentially-infuriating as DOGMA, perhaps, but it's certainly right up there.  The premise is simple: three teens seek sex from a woman who turns out to be the daughter of a Christian fanatic who has taken his religion to extremes.  His family cult kills homosexuals, and even though the three teens don't fit the profile, they're close enough for government work.  Speaking of which, the A.T.F shows up, and a Wacco-esque standoff ensues.  Add in an epilogue worthy of the Coen Brothers, and some wise-cracking that is decidedly Smith's own, and you have an entertaining thriller.

The thing is, religion isn't Smith's target.  Yes, Abin Cooper (a superb Michael Parks) and his daughter (Melissa Leo, not quite getting to shine) are religious in the extreme; but the three teens (among whom Michael Angarano stands out) aren't exactly likable either, driven more by their hormones than anything else.  On the A.T.F.'s side, we have a morally-confused agent in the form of John Goodman, following orders but not entirely happy about it.  None of these characters is entirely likeable (Goodman remains the most sympathetic), but they aren't supposed to be.  Smith is exploring humanity's desire for blind belief: in God, in sex, in politics, and every combination thereof.  He even divides his cast, in the end credits, into those categories.  He condemns, bloodily so, but that doesn't mean he's happy about it.

Parks and Goodman are phenomenal; whatever your political/social views, watch the film for their performances.  The supporting cast is solid; look for a great Stephen Root as the local sheriff, and Kevin Pollak as another A.T.F. agent.  The dialogue flows smoothly, and the action is actually pretty cool; Smith knows how to show someone getting shot.  The film is admittedly a bit didactic, but that's part of its charm: it's nice to see a filmmaker not hedging his bets, and instead giving us exactly what's on his mind.  Make no mistake about RED STATE: Kevin Smith isn't setting his sights merely on religious fanatics.  He has all of us, to some extent or other, in his cross hairs.",1318982400,48,2222,5.008174386920981
4686013,2,B005FUTBWS,"On the way to school, Travis (Michael Angarano) notices members of the Five Points Church, led by Abin Cooper (Michael Parks) protesting the funeral of a local gay teenager who was found murdered. During Travis' first class, his teacher talks about how Cooper and his church had their town ridiculed for his actions and beliefs. Later, Jared (Kyle Gallner), a friend of Travis, reveals he received an invitation from a woman he met on a sex site for group sex with himself, Travis and Billy Ray (Nicholas Braun). They borrow Travis' parent's car and travel out into the country to meet with the woman.

Along the way, they accidentally sideswipe the vehicle of Sheriff Wynan (Stephen Root), while he was engaged in a homosexual affair in his car. Afraid, the boys drive off. Sheriff Wynan returns to the station and tells his deputy Pete (Matt L. Jones) to go and look for the vehicle. Meanwhile, the boys arrive at the trailer of the woman who sent out the invitation, Sarah Cooper (Melissa Leo). She encourages them to drink, and after being drugged by the beer, they pass out while undressing. Jared wakes up while being moved in a covered cage. He realizes he is in the sanctuary at Five Points after he identifies Cooper. Cooper begins a long, hate-filled sermon before identifying another captive, a homosexual they lured in through an internet chat room. They bind him to a cross using saran wrap, violently execute him with a revolver and drop him into a small crawl space where Travis and Billy Ray are bound together.

Cooper then begins binding Jared to the cross, but stops when he notices Pete driving up to the church. Travis and Billy Ray use a protruding bone from the corpse to cut themselves free, which is heard by Caleb (Ralph Garman). He lifts up the trap door just in time to see Billy Ray escape and begins after him. Billy Ray is not able to help Travis out of his tight saran wrap cuffs and leaves him for dead. Caleb chases Billy Ray while passing Travis into a room stocked with weapons, where the two end up shooting and killing each other. Pete hears the gunshots and calls Wynan for back-up, but is shot and killed by Mordechai (James Parks). Cooper then blackmails Wynan, telling him to stay away or he will reveal Wynan's homosexuality to his wife. In despair, Wynan calls ATF Agent Joseph Keenan (John Goodman), who begins setting up outside of the church.

While the family mourn Caleb, Travis (who had broken free and feigned death alongside Billy Ray's corpse) arms himself and makes a run for it, eventually making it outside where he is shot and killed by Wynan, who mistook him for a member of the congregation. Keenan tries to reason with the family but a shoot-out erupts instead after one Keenan's men is shot in the head. In the midst of the shooting, Agent Keenan receives a call from ATF higher-ups ordering him to start a full raid of the complex to ensure that no witnesses remain of the operation, and no one can tell of their mess up. Another tactical agent named ""Harry"" (Kevin Alejandro) struggles with this decision and argues with Keenan in private against doing this. Keenan coldly dismisses Harry's protests for personal reasons -- rationalizing his decision based on personal gain and the reputation of the ATF -- and Harry storms off in disgust. During the shoot-out, Cheyenne (Kerry Bish) unbinds Jared, begging him to help her hide the children.

Jared coldly refuses due to the fact that the church is evil and had killed both his best friends, and the arguement turns into a fight. Sarah notices them and attacks Jared. Cheyenne tries to break up the fight and accidentally shoots Sarah in the process, killing her. Jared, realizing no matter what he does he will end up dead, helps Cheyenne hide the children. They run outside to plead with Keenan to spare the children but are brutally shot and murdered by Tactical Agent Harry, who has come around to accepting Keenan's rationales, though Keenan is now visibly disturbed the reality of this outcome and Harry's actions. The shoot-out is then suddenly interrupted when a mysterious loud trumpet ominously blast echos across the sky.

If ""Red State"" proves one thing it is that Kevin Smith is a much better writer than he is a director. In the comedy genre, direction only matters so much. If the jokes aren't there, what can a director do? He can't make ""nothing"" funny. In the horror genre, the role of the director is key. He is responsible for the scares, the pacing, the thrills, and the overall tone of the movie. ""Red State"" works as written but the film as directed is a bit of a mess. Far too many characters, a limp, lackluster editing, and too many ""Kevin Smith type"" characters. I kept thinking how a movie like this would be directed in the hands of a more accomplished filmmaker who could get a hold of the subject matter such as Rob Zombie. I appreciate the effort here and the performances are all uniformally good but it all adds up to very little.",1318982400,2,4977,4.676940639269406
4686014,4,B005FUTBWS,"In an era of bloated unnecessary remakes a director takes a shot at reflecting our times and successfully breaks out of his own comfort zone.  Without a doubt this is Smith's best work dialogue wise what he and his actors achieve is believable and entertaining aside from the new found competence he shows visually.  Obviously movies aren't made alone and this was clearly a labor of love for many involved, and you can feel a more assured hand behind the writing and all of the other production. The entire method of shirking the studio marketing middle men and searching for exhibitors on their own couldn't have been attempted on a better work it just fits the material.  There is a great deal of dark humanity and truth in many scenes with Goodman(for me his finale with his superiors feels like forced exposition however), but Michael Parks gets to mumble, drawl and sing his way into cinema legend with his complete command of the screen and character.  Kevin also does a good job with the script keeping a fairly even tone and taking unexpected side routes at every turn , just like he did at Sundance which makes for a terrific extra as do the few deleted scenes and the plethora of commentaries.  Politics aside if there is a message it is that any of us can be the villain and many of us are unknowingly and knowingly.",1318982400,8,1328,4.586497890295359
4686015,4,B005FUTBWS,"Kevin Smith's ""Red State"" is such a bold and angry film, there's a tendency to forgive its many faults. It's telling that almost an hour after watching this work, my friends and family were still discussing the plot's ebbs and flows and ultimately, its thematic significance. Smith should be applauded for writing and directing an unorthodox statement on some of the more troubling aspects of society, but he sabotages his own efforts with his trademark snark dialog and an ambition which surpasses an obviously low budget.

I have always considered Smith's work to be overrated, though&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clerks-Collector-s-Series/dp/B00000IQC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clerks (Collector's Series)</a>&nbsp;is a classic statement of its era. ""Red State,"" for the most part, is unlike anything he's ever attempted. He mixes a variety of genres, tilting what is essentially a horror film upon its head to become a satirical statement on religion, oppression, human rights and violence. He has a brilliant cast at his disposal, though I question the hiring of Michael Parks in the crucial role of the Reverend Abin Cooper. It's a gimmicky choice, as Parks' Hopperesque persona is better served for supporting work. A more substantial actor would have raised the level of this film several notches. Of course, Parks gives the greatest performance of a long and peculiar career, but opposed to what?&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Wish-V-The-Face-of-Death/dp/6305245487/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Wish V: The Face of Death</a>?<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Evictors/dp/B0001E7TL8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Evictors</a>? Anyway, he's the leader of an especially sinister religious clan, a sort of combination of David Koresh and Fred Phelps, regularly protesting homosexuality while stockpiling a deadly arsenal of weapons at his rural compound.

Three teenagers (Michael Angarano, Nicholas Braun, Kyle Gallner) decide to borrow the parents' car and drive to the country to visit a middle-aged woman encountered on-line for an evening of casual sex. They meet Sara (Melissa Leo) at a rundown trailer and are drugged and kidnapped. They awaken to discover they are hostages of Cooper's religious compound, being lined up for sacrifice due to their sinful ways. Reverend Cooper gives a fascinating 10-minutes-long sermon before dragging the first hostage on stage, gagged and wrapped in cellophane. I'm not sure I can forgive Smith for this extended sequence of misery and murder, though one does not have a doubt as to these fanatics' intentions. Almost to the minute the ATF arrives on the scene in preparation of a raid, led by none other than John Goodman. As usual, Goodman steals just about every scene he's in due to his intensely natural presence, an underrated actor who is the Robert Duvall of modern times. Things immediately go awry, as they usually do when the ATF decides to strong-arm religious compounds (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Waco-The-Rules-of-Engagement/dp/B0000DIJOO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Waco - The Rules of Engagement</a>), and people drop dead about as quickly as they did in Peckinpah's Battle of Bloody Porch (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wild-Bunch-The-Original-Director-s-Cut/dp/0790731037/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wild Bunch - The Original Director's Cut</a>).

Ultimately, the ATF are given the green light to kill everyone on-site after government executives dub the compound's inhabitants as terrorists, thus even women and children become opportunities for target practice. Quite a few interesting characters are introduced, only to be unceremoniously killed in shocking fashion. I can see what Smith is doing here, going against conditioned expectations of traditional Hollywood flow. There's even one very good supporting actor you suspect to have a more substantial role whose head is blown off after barely a line of dialog. Such intentional chaos hurts the film, but your mouth will be agape.

The already-mentioned low budget is apparent during the ATF's attempts to attack the compound. It's clear there is no military order, and a hand-held camera mixed with rapid editing camouflages what is essentially a home movie reproducing chaos. When the smoke finally clears, there's barely an actor left standing and a minutes-long speech attempting to analyze all that has come before lacks the poetic depth Smith was attempting. But this is truly a brave film revealing signs of a spiritually enraged artist. Smith said he plans to retire from directing, which to me sounds like the pontifications of a drama queen. He has shown a level of promise in ""Red State"" not seen in his past work. If he throws the gimmicks out the window and eliminates the bawdy snark, he's going to hit a home run soaring so far it will shock even him.",1318896000,,5024,5.944674965421854
4686016,3,B005FUTBWS,"As a fan of Kevin Smith's I was looking forward to Red State. However, the film is a disappointment and I can not recommend it.
What should be a simple story of a Waco-like siege on a group of religious extremists is borderline incoherent due to a number of tonal shifts.
While the acting is sublime, particularly the performances by Michael Parks and John Goodman, they are wasted on such an uneven script. Other fine characters, like Stephen Root's conflicted police chief are introduced and then cast aside.
Much has been made of funnyman Kevin Smith branching out and making a serious horror/thriller. While he succeeds in creating an arresting visual style, due to his direction and taut editing, he should have collaborated with another writer that understands the genre better.",1318118400,9,784,4.99236641221374
4686017,3,B005FUTBWS,"RED STATE will polarize the audience.  There are fans of writer/director Kevin Smith (Cop Out, Zack and Miri Make a Porno, Clerks, Clerks II,  Jersey Girl, Chasing Amy, Mallrats, etc) and there are detractors.  And the country is pretty much divided now between right wing and left wing politics. A story that concentrates on the more extreme version of right wing evangelical religion is bound to cause a schism in viewers. But in the presence of all the murders of gay people like Matthew Shepard and  Lawrence King and the racist torture and decapitation of James Byrd, Jr. etc the story needs to be told.

Opening with a trio of teenage friends - Travis (Michael Angarano, very underused in this film!), Billy-Ray (Nicholas Braun) and Randy (Ronnie Connell) -who have searched the Internet for 'physical satisfaction' they come upon a women who will take on three men - a middle aged woman Sara (Melissa Leo) in their little town - and they borrow Travis' parents' car and go off to find adventure. On the way there they sideswipe a parked car that just happens to contain the town sheriff in the middle of a same-sex act.  They eventually find Sara in her trailer house, are invited in, plied with 'beer', and once they have been narcotized they awaken in cages in the church run by Abin Cooper (Michael Parks): the church is small, contains only members of Abin Cooper's family, preaches hellfire and damnation to all gays, and have started to torture and murder the captured trio.  From this  point the story becomes almost unwatchable as the sheriff's assistant calls on the church only to get shot, the Special Agents led by Joseph Keenan (John Goodman) arrive, and a shoot out begins.  Travis escapes but is shot on his way to freedom, one of the young girls in the Abin Cooper family, Cheyenne (Kerry Bish in a top notch performance) tries to save the children of the family to no avail, and Keenan is told by telephone to treat the church as a terrorist haven and kill everyone - a philosophy Keenan finds difficult to follow.  How the battle ends is the crux of the tale - is anyone completely free of evil or completely lacking good?

Though the film is very heavy handed it does draw attention to one of the many forms of bigotry and prejudice that are paralyzing this country.  The idea behind the film is a sound one but the delivery of the story is so over the top that the production dilutes the impact.  Grady Harp, October 11",1317686400,3,2446,4.621247113163972

4686027,4,B005FUTBWS,"Red State has received more attention for the way director Kevin Smith controversially auctioned the film to himself at Sundance and then chose to distribute it, rather than the real novelty of the film; the fact that it's a horror film directed by Kevin Smith. At least, it's billed that way. Truth is, Red State may have elements of a horror film, but it also has the elements of an action film and the elements of a Kevin Smith film which makes it hard to confine it to one genre. This becomes a problem since the film never settles comfortably for a singular vision and all these elements don't mesh together well. It's imperfections as a film must be noted right away, but it remains a refreshing change of pace for Smith and shows that he does possess the capability to surprise people.

En route to his local high school, Travis (Michael Angarano) spots members of the Five Points Trinity Church protesting the funeral of a recently murdered, homosexual teenager. At school, even the teacher talks about the church and how the most ultra of the ultra-Conservatives have distanced themselves from the politics of Five Points Church. Travis and his friends Jared (Kyle Gallner) and Billy Ray (Nicholas Braun) have other things on their mind though. Jared has set up a meeting online with an older woman for all three of them. When they go to meet the woman, they are ambushed by Sarah Cooper (Melissa Leo) and the rest of the churchgoers. Brought to the church, the head pastor Abin Cooper (Michael Parks) takes center stage and reveals that the church is much more sinister than anybody believed.

The film begins like a typical modern horror movie. Teenagers, their heads full of the potential for sex, find themselves in a dangerous situation. Red State abruptly changes gears once its three principal characters are kidnapped and the remainder of the film is basically a standoff between the church compound and ATF Agents, unaware of the kidnapped teenagers inside. There are other familiar faces in the cast, including John Goodman and Kevin Pollak as two ATF agents and Stephen Root as the closeted local sheriff.

Smith's film is inspired by the Westboro Baptist Church and their leader Fred Phelps, the group that the Ku-Klux-Klan dismissed as too extreme in their intolerance. Smith has constructed the Five Points Church and its members from the WBC, but the Five Points Church is a cinematic hybrid of the WBC, the Branch Davidians, and the Manson Family. In watching Michael Parks play Abin Cooper, I'm quite sure he looked to the respective leaders of these groups/cults as there are visible aspects of Phelps, David Koresh, and Charles Manson in the performance. Phelps is the most obvious, but Parks is much more charismatic than that. Smith reveals his presence behind the camera when Abin Cooper enters the film and, with Jared trapped in a nearby cage, preaches to his congregation for nearly fifteen minutes about his extremist views. His dialogue isn't satirical either and besides the kidnapped teenagers on stage him with him, Cooper's preaching is actually less extreme than that of Fred Phelps' clan. I must emphasize again that Cooper preaches for nearly fifteen minutes. Red State is only 80 minutes. From his first scene to his final scene, Parks chews the scenery like gum without ever going over-the-top. A character actor, best known for playing a recurring police officer in several Quentin Tarantino films, he's able to really make an impression here. With his commanding performance at the center, he brings instant prestige to the film. Red State has been putting itself in place for Academy Award consideration. Say what you will about the film itself and Kevin Smith as a writer and director; Parks may have a real chance. It's a bravura performance, flamboyant and brilliant enough to consider Oscar-worthy. These are the best performances that Kevin Smith has ever seen to fruition. No one gives a weak performance and don't let the horror tag fool you; this is a film driven by performances. Melissa Leo, an actress of unbridled talent, is extreme here but great as usual. John Goodman meanwhile is given a really meaty role, bringing unexpected depth to a film that doesn't require it.

There's not a frame of Red State that even remotely resembles anything that Smith has done before, but it's clearly his work. Billed as a horror film, the film is heavy on blood but light on both gore and actual horror. Unheard and unseen of in horror films of late, there's also a strong emphasis on character and dialogue. Red State is much closer in spirit to an exploitation film, as its subject matter is built on the foundation of the exploitation genre; taking a topical subject and exploiting it to extreme lengths. The latter half of the film is a large-scale stand-off sequence, complete with shoot-outs, moral dilemmas, and several onscreen deaths. Smith's forte is character and dialogue, but he's quite good with shoot-outs too. The laziness that marred the action sequences of Cop Out, his previous film, isn't present here. There was obviously more passion behind the camera as well as in the editing room.

Smith has publicly noted that he considers himself more of a writer than a director, yet ironically the biggest imperfections in Red State stem from the writing, with Smith never settling on a particular direction for his film. Smith has a gift for dialogue and it suits the film well here, but the dialogue between the teenaged characters in earlier scenes is heavy-handed; like it's trying to be vulgar, rather than letting vulgarity illustrate the mind-set of these characters. Smith has said that this would be a straight-forward horror film, with no comedy. Well, there is some comedy; there's just no toilet humor. The epilogue especially veers into comedy (of a satirical nature), but doesn't betray what came before it. Since he never settles specifically into the horror genre, the comedy keeps things interesting. One of the best moments in the film is also one of the funniest, with Smith delivering the film's final line off-screen. It's hilarious, but the symbolic nature of him delivering the line works on a much deeper level than just a director cameo pining for laughs.

There's a lack of direction, as Smith's horror film never allows itself to be categorized. It's not horrific enough to be horror, nor is there enough action for it to be an action film. Smith could have made an indictment of religious extremism in America, but chose not to. Perhaps Smith believed that showing the group, who don't do anything in the film that hasn't been perpetrated by real fundamentalists in the name of religion, speaks volumes by itself. While there are no profound statements made here about religion or anything else, Red State is not a failure and is an enjoyable film. It's well directed, with great performances and great dialogue; entertaining and much better than most of the crap that passes for horror/exploitation nowadays.

I admit that it's not the horror film that Smith promised, but it is better than most of the ""horror"" films audiences have been treated to in recent years. It also proves that Smith isn't the one-note director he's been accused of being. Red State is not a great film, it's not perfect, and I could make suggestions on what could have been improved, but Smith needs to be given credit for making a dark, fun movie. It lacks a profound or even profoundly satirical look at the fundamentalists he's going after, but Smith's final line sums everything up perfectly. When it comes to dealing with religious extremists of this sort, it's really the only thing you can say.

4686034,5,B005FUTBWS,"RED STATE is - hands down - the most important, relevant, terrifying, disturbing, insightful, unflinching, vital, and powerful commentary on American religious fanaticism any filmmaker has dared to throw on the screen in the history of cinema.  It's also the most shocking, brutal, exciting, heartbreaking, thrilling, exhilarating, nail-biting, funny, hang-on-the-edge-of-your-seat, flat-out BEST piece of filmmaking anyone will release this year.

You finish watching it with the same feeling you had in 1992, walking out of Clint Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN.  With RED STATE, editor/writer/director Kevin Smith has taken a major artistic step onto a whole new level of filmmaking and he deserves Oscars for every category he's eligible for this year - Editing, Original Screenplay, Directing and Best Picture.  There's not one single misstep from the first frame, and not one unauthentic beat by any actor in any performance.  It's a film technically superior to every $200,000,000 blockbuster released this summer on all levels - acting, direction, writing, cinematography, sound, sound effects editing, scoring, music editing, special effects -  the whole nine yards.

RED STATE is the ultimate example of less is more - it hits you harder and blows you out of the theater 1,000 times faster than TRANSFORMERS or HARRY POTTER ever could.",1315353600,2,1335,5.54679802955665

4686037,5,B005FUTBWS,"QT said it and I also will do the same, although it may not carry the same merrit.

I will tell you why but first I must say this is the first movie that sent me on an emotional thrill ride. First I was terrified because these people were nuts. Some of it reminding me about the people in WBC although I don't think they are on this level. Second I was like ""Hell Yeah"" because the action was awesome., Lastly I was laughing cause some of the dialougue near the end was hilarious. Not because it was bad, but because it was meant to be funny.

Michael Parks is utterly terrifying. I couldn't tell if he was a maniacal genious or just plain Crazy. This brings me to the fact that I have heard and seen a few reviews say the writing was lazy. If it was and wasn't intentional, it still works. The writing does have a B movie feel at times, but the way it is delievered makes it amazing. I couldn't help but imagine I was in this situation and was cheering for the good guys in the end. The other thing I heard was the ending was weak. I partially agree with this but the more and more I think about it, it worked. It wrapped the movie up the way only Kevin Smith can do. I will put it all on the line and say this movie is one of a kind. Definitely not something ever put out by KS. but something he needs to do more of.

I leave you on this..... IF YOU DONT SEE THIS, YOU WILL BE MISSING ONE OF THE FUNNEST MOVIES IN AWHILE. Definitely makes one of my top 10.",1315267200,4,1458,3.9863013698630136

I can look past a lot of things but there are too many instances where the characters actions were far too outlandish, even in an outlandish movie.  The setup of getting the teenagers to the church was very B Movie in and of itself. Then you have a teenager with a fully loaded, fully automatic weapon who decides to run through a crowd of armed people as opposed to fire a few shots.  I commend the movie for shooting him unexpectedly at least.  Then the focal characters get killed easily, and I'm thinking...what's the point? If there was more to the movie, and more plot, more character development I would applaud the unexpected killing of some of the main characters, but this isn't A Game of Thrones and it just left me thinking I wasted $11.",1315180800,8,907,4.407185628742515

Very watchable, even if I had to have a friend in the room with me the first time I viewed the film because of all the violence. Rent if, like me, you can't wait for the theatrical release of the film. I can't wait to see ""Red State"" at the theater now.",1315180800,,547,3.981818181818182
4686040,5,B005FUTBWS,"I can see why Kevin Smith went outside the traditional Hollywood prodection model with this one: Red State was wholy unexpected and pretty much devoid of Smith's trademark, fouled mouth, outlandish humor. With only a few known faces among the cast, it was surprisingly well acted, well written and put together in a compelling way. I can't be sure because it wasn't credited, but I'm fairly certain Mr. Smith upheld his tradtion of appearing in his films: I'm pretty sure he delivered the last line of the movie, from offscreen. If I'm correct, I'm fairly certain I know Kevin Smith made such a movie: The burning desire to deliver such a statement to narrow-minded hatemongers who couch their fears and hatred in religion.

Not sure why this was listed as horror though. The story and the motivation of Abin Cooper(Michael Parks) and his followers were in truth, horrifying, but the content of the film isn't what one would expect from a ""Horror"" film. Watch for more of KErry Bishe' in the future, Hollywood loves young blondes and she played Cheyenne as if she were born for it.

Great movie, well worth the 10 bucks.",1315180800,8,1120,4.768041237113402
4686041,4,B005FUTBWS,"I'm actually surprised that this is the first Kevin Smith I'm reviewing. I've really liked his films over the years, even MALLRATS, which Smith himself seems to dislike at times. Personally, I'd like to think that Kevin Smith is the John Hughes of my generation, but I grew up with Hughes the same as Smith did, so I'll just say that they're in the same league of filmmaking. However, I don't think John Hughes would have made a film quite like Red State and he would've stayed more in the comedy genre. With Red State, Kevin Smith broke away from the comedy genre and went into something completely different. Part psychological thriller, part social commentary, part horror film, part action flick; Red State is something uniquely it's own.

Red State is essentially about Abin Cooper (Michael Parks) and his Five-Point Trinity Church. Red State delivers a horrifying look at Christian fundamentalists and how absorbed into their own twisted views on Christianity they become. Basically, Kevin Smith portrays Abin Cooper as a cross between Fred Phelps and David Koresh.

The movie opens with three teenage boys being led to meet a 38 year old woman at her trailer in the middle of nowhere for casual sex. Not knowing it's a trap, they all are kidnapped and soon become the victims of the Five-Point Trinity Church and their plot to rid the world of sin and sinners.

Having been on the radar from the ATF for harboring illegal firearms, Abin Cooper is currently under surveillance so the ATF send in Agent Joseph Keenan (John Goodman)to head up the invasion on the Cooper compound. What happens next is essentially a stand-off between local law enforcement, headed up by sheriff Wynan (Stephen Root), and the ATF agents.

Basically that's the plot without spoilers and the best I can do to sum up the essentials in simplistic form. I'd rather not go further into details and spoil anything, so we'll leave it at that short synopsis. What I really enjoyed about the movie was how it shifted genres or combined several at once. Kevin Smith superbly weaved together a great narrative and character piece by combining different elements of filmmaking and the end result was Red State.

The acting in this film is truly top-notch and brilliant. Michael Parks totally embodies the Abin Cooper character and shines as the brilliant religious zealot. The sermon he delivers in the first act is truly creepy and so well acted that I was lost in every word he spoke. John Goodman, although looking kind of old and haggard, plays the conflicted ATF agent very well. If it weren't for Michael Parks stealing the show, I'd have a lot more to say about Goodman. He was excellently cast and really did a great job. However, every character was cast perfectly and acted their respective roles brilliantly.

The script was excellent. Smith has a knack for realistic and witty dialogue with a lot of banter between characters, but here he seems to transform that ability into monologues (the sermon Michael Parks delivers) and short interactions between characters. It's almost as if he streamlined what he normally does (long dialogue scenes between characters) and made the pacing faster and smoother. It works great here, but I doubt it would work as good in his previous films. I think that's what I admire most about Kevin Smith as a writer. He adapts to the film he's working on and writes what's best for the story. Here is no different.

The directing Kevin Smith did here is probably his best job yet. The camera work was so unlike any of his previous films, but yet it felt like a Kevin Smith film. The pacing was perfect and the film didn't stall out once. From the opening scene until the end credits, Smith has the viewer hooked and leaves them reeling at the end and wanting more. This is his best piece of filmmaking yet.

My gripes with the movie are really small. I felt the running time was a little on the short side and wanted to really get some back story and set-up with a few of the characters. I mean John Goodman comes into the film about thirty minutes in, and although he does a great job in this role, I felt cheated with his amount of screen time. The same can be said for Stephen Root and Kevin Pollack who are two amazing actors that I loved seeing, but they were hardly in the movie. This isn't saying this is bad, but I just wanted more. More characters, more story, and more time with the film. Clocking in at around 95 minutes, I felt this movie deserved more running time. I would really love to see a director's cut of the film and see another thirty minutes or so cut back into it. Overall, this gripe should say something for Kevin Smith and Red State. I wanted more and if that's my biggest gripe, that's saying something.

All in all I thought Red State was a great film. It made me run the gauntlet of emotions and I felt that I was truly watching something great. Mainly because I was doing just that. Red State is above average on all levels, and I think ultimately had it been longer and some of the plot points and characters developed more, it would be a near perfect film. My hat is off to Kevin Smith as he promoted this movie all on his own. He got it distributed himself and took it on tour like filmmakers used to do decades ago. That took serious balls to attempt, especially for this type of film. I won't go into too much detail here, so if you want to know how Red State came to be and how hard a time it had getting shown, look it up. It's just as interesting a story as the film is itself.

Overall, I recommend this movie highly, but warn that it should be watched with an open mind and not be taken seriously. Although, it should be taken serious enough when dealing with religious zealots like the Westboro Baptist Church and Fred Phelps. I'm glad Kevin Smith made this movie and I'm glad that the film sneers at people like Fred Phelps. Someone should show how nutty these people can be and how violent it can all end (ie- David Koresh). Red State has the balls to show them for who they are, even though it's fictionalized for entertainment sake.

4686046,2,B005FUTBWS,"When I first started watching this movie, I really thought I was in for something that spoke out against the Fred Phelps mentality in a strong way... or maybe gave us a direction of attack to put those types of protests to rest without us having to give up our right to free speech.  Sadly, I got neither one.  Despite the other two reviews here giving suspiciously high ratings of the film, I really can't recommend it.

I'm also somewhat disturbed by how law enforcement is represented here.  It's pretty clear that someone involved in this movie had something against cops based on the portrayal.  Granted, I have a bit of bias here, as I used to work very closely with law enforcement myself, so I tend to side with them more than not, but this movie clearly went over the top to try to put them in a negative light and make them look like idiots.

The more I watched, the more I hoped that the movie would turn around at the end, but when I walked away, I couldn't help but think that I should have done something better with my time.  Maybe Kevin Smith wanted to finally end a movie the way he originally wanted to end Clerks.  If that was his goal, he achieved it, but very little else.  As someone who really does like a lot of Smith's other films, I'm really disappointed.",1315094400,3,1281,4.348739495798319
4686047,5,B005FUTBWS,"This film is nothing less then brilliant, I think it's genius. Genius because it goes against the machine of the movie industry, it's exactly what Kevin Smith wanted it to be. Red State is nothing I expected and I've followed this film since 2007 when I first started listening to SModcast, All the way to the last chilling word uttered in this film I was in suspense and glued to the edge of my seat upward with sweaty palms, completely in awe of the horror the likes of witch I haven't seen since I saw Aliens in the 80's.

  This movie will throw you off the typical trail of the predictable horror or terror movie, it by no means is a commercial film and I've seen negative comments because it lacks a general predictable approach that the studio's always take in making movies, they expect a certain style of movie because that's all they've had fed to them their entire lives by the studio system, but that's what makes Red State so genius. It's got elements of all colors as far as tone and setting for the scenes and I'll not give away any spoilers unlike other reviews, it's like a game of clue in that right when you think you have it figured out, you don't. Brilliant is all of the actors in this movie, I can't say enough about the absolute genius in this movie given by the cast without seeming hammy so I'll spare the details except to say that the performances given in this movie are so convincing that I found myself totally in the scenes 100% like a fly on a fencepost, David Klein's camera work as his team seems fantastically omnipresent and elusive not to mention crisp and clear with great hand held quality, I even backed up a tad when things got a little close, and I'm not an easy person to sell when it comes to suspending disbelief.

Great Film, all the actors deserve awards for their performances, it's rare today that an original film is even made in the world of reboots and prequel's, that Red State would exist with such great veteran actors that give their all, all together in a scene like when Ralph Garman's mute character takes charge of the screen with such intensity with all of these other guys, to where I believed in that moment they were these people they were playing, is non existent in the super hero laden scape of cinema today. When Melisa Leo's character did... anything, my skin crawled and felt creepy outright frightened by the intensity, Frankly she reminded me of the coat hanger metal skull plate having guy in Texas Chainsaw Massacre part 2 when we first see him in the radio station lobby in the ""Sonny Bono Wig-Do"" as he burns the hanger with a lighter then scratches his skull with the hot wire. Freaked out to hell.

His last movie will be a hockey movie called ""Hit Somebody"" that will take place over two movies. Red State however, is proof he can make a serious movie. As with any Smith movie there is a LOT of dialogue. Michael Parks goes on a good bit preaching and while it may seem to go on forever. Actually listen to the content because it where they are coming from and why they do what they are doing. Park was OUTSTANDING in this movie and should get some recognition. The camera was not a typical Kevin Smith movie either. The way Red State is show is very fitting for the atmosphere.

I have no idea why some reviewers (not necessarily here) are saying the movie is inconsistent. Sadly they are laying a stereotype on Kevin Smith because of past movies or his ""stoner"" ways. Because he openly talks about it why or how does that reflect on his ability to make a movie? Some of these critics need learn to wipe the slate clean with each movie because a movie maker can grow.

The viewer gets to be omnipotent by seeing what the others don't while at the same time getting to know the characters along the way. Of course you get Smith's wordsmithing dialogue at it's finest and when delivered by such a greats like Parks and Goodman you end up with a well crafted tale and something to think about. I'll be revisiting this flick again for sure.",1522108800,,813,4.3202614379084965

8470684,3,B005FUTBWS,"Difficult to say where I stand with this film immediately after watching it, but honestly I think that's what Smith may have been going for.
It's downright unpleasant to watch throughout, which is the point, as it intentionally offers a tough perspective on both cults and the government.
If I were to use a food analogy I'd say it's beef jerky; difficult to chew on but has it's value and serves it's intended purpose well.",1520726400,,424,4.666666666666667

8470686,5,B005FUTBWS,Not at all what I expected. Expected more torture scenes from what a friend said but it was nevertheless amazing. Shows the one dimensional thoughts of religious fanatics. John Goodman and Michael Parks nailed it. Another masterpiece by Kevin Smith.,1520208000,,249,5.25
