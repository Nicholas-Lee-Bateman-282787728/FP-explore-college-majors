8081939,4,B000B5XP7Y,"More over Jonathan and Jennifer. The 1950's TV equivalent of ""Hart to Hart"" was the offbeat murder-mystery series MR. & MRS. NORTH. When it became apparent that Richard Denning wasn't going to be automatically re-cast opposite Lucille Ball in ""I Love Lucy"" (the show inspired by the radio serial ""My Favourite Husband"" in which he had starred with Ball), Denning took the role of Jerry North, a publisher who also dabbles in sleuthing with his lovely wife Pamela (Barbara Britton).

MR. & MRS. NORTH was based on a series of novellas written by Richard Lockridge; the characters were later featured in a long-running radio serial, which started out in 1946 and ended up airing concurrently with the TV series (which debuted in 1952). The TV series of MR. & MRS. NORTH, sponsored by Revlon Cosmetics, played on CBS from 1952-53, and was later picked up by NBC for additional episodes in 1954.

Episodes:

""On the Rocks"" - A peaceful weekend in the country is interrupted by the mysterious poisoning death of a rival publisher's wife.

""Pretty Baby"" - A baby boy is left on the North's doorstep by his mother. He is then kidnapped, before landing safely with a reunited family in a comedy of errors.

""Formula for Trouble"" - Pam borrows a book from the library with an envelope containing a secret formula between its pages. The Norths become involved in an investigation of the laboratory where the formula originated.

""Good Boy"" - Pam purchases a replica of an antique chest at an auction. Upon delivery, Jerry discovers a corpse in it, as well as a hidden compartment containing diamonds.",1143158400,4,1590,4.8487084870848705
