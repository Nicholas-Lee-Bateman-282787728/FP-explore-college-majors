2511659,5,B000EA8U44,"Finding Faith in Christ certainly is a keeper. It manages to pack more thigh-slappers into a mere 29 minutes than Mel Gibson could fit into two hours:

1) Icky Jesus: Now, I've seen stuffy Jesuses (Max von Sydow) stoned-out Jesuses (Ted Neely) surfer Jesuses (Jeffrey Hunter) and raving nuts Jesuses (Willem Dafoe) but this is the first Jesus who strikes me as some creep you'd meet at a Korn concert and somehow just can't lose. He spends most of the short walking around like a blissed-out male lead in a pharmaceutical ad for paroxetine, until the Agony in the Garden, where he suddenly gets all weepy (serotonin withdrawal?) Who is this actor? In the absence of credits, perhaps we will never know.

2) Bad Beards: Whoever he is, this Jesus portrayer gets my vote for the Worst Facial Hair on a Cinematic Christ Figure since Nikolai Cherkasov in Ivan the Terrible. The wispy growth leaves you hoping the Romans will work in a close shave somewhere between the scourging and the crucifixion.

3) The Motel of Babel: The film deepens the mystery as to which form of English was actually spoken in first-century Palestine. The apostle Thomas, spinning gospel yarns for his family, speaks in late-90's American, but the characters in his flashbacks all speak in Elizabethan English. The one exception is Joseph looking for room at the inn, who mysteriously speaks Aramaic (at least I think it's Aramaic, it could be Kibbutz Hebrew).

4) The Miracle of the Stop-and-Go Boat: The film starts with Jesus calming the storm on the Sea of Galilee, but we're in for an even more impressive miracle immediately thereafter. The boat they're in stays put long enough for Jesus to finish his aphorism on the importance of faith, then starts lurching toward shore -- inexplicably, because the sail is completely furled. It's a short-lived wonder, however; the boat moves about 20 feet over the water and then comes to a complete halt once again. This ""special"" effect is repeated at the end of the film, just in case the viewer, like Jesus' own disciples, just can't quite believe his eyes.

Finding Faith in Christ left me wanting more, although perhaps not in the way its LDS producers intended. And while not converting me to Mormonism, it certainly did help confirm my opinion of it.",1186185600,5,2275,4.823076923076923

8107869,3,B000EA8U44,Though this is a LDS DVD. It doesn't contain any doctrinal subjects. I quite enjoyed it. I got it for free from 2 Mormans who came to my house.,1355875200,5,143,3.9655172413793105
8107870,5,B000EA8U44,"I am no movie critic, and I do not have a bone to pick with Jesus Christ as it appears another reviewer of this DVD must have.

This was an excellent overview of the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. The movie and the video effects gave life to the stories of Jesus Christ that I read in the bible. I have never seen Jesus Christ, so as far as I am concerned, the actor that played Jesus Christ in the DVD might even look like him. I guess someday we will all know.

This was a touching short film about Jesus Christ, his life, and ministry, that helped me feel just a little closer, and maybe understand just a little bit better, what Jesus Christ was like, and what he must have went through while he lived here upon this earth. I highly recommend the DVD.",1261699200,13,759,4.156462585034014
