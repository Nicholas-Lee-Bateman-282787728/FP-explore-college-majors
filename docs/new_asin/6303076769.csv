557587,5,6303076769,"I bought this for my choir to watch while I'm away.  It gives an interesting perspective on how singers record in a music studio, especially how they perform while they sing.  I am very glad that I previewed it before letting the choir watch it, because Ms. Faith Prince let's out a dousy after she forgets a lyric.  Just beware of an extra expletive or two during the 11"" mark.",1263859200,,378,4.371428571428571
557588,4,6303076769,"This recording is a wonderful opportunity for anyone who has not seen the Broadway cast perform this fun show! This is how I was introduced to Faith Prince, whose performance is ASTONISHING and FAR surpasses the relatively lame one from the movie. It's not a full reproduction of the show, but all of the big numbers are done completely and you can >>> SEE <<< the fun that the cast is having with the music and the roles.

Though I really, REALLY liked Frank Sinatra as Nathan Lane and Stubby Kaye as Nicely-Nicely, I would have LOVED to see THIS group perform the show!",1155513600,12,571,4.490384615384615
557589,5,6303076769,The documentary is a thrilling piece of how the 1992 revival CD of Guys and Dolls was made. My only regret is that they never mention the name of the show. I never knew that Faith Prince was a dirty mouth and 40 years old. I didn't know that Peter Gallagher had rotten teeth. I didn't know that Jozie de Guzman had more gums than teeth. It is a good documentary nonetheless.,1011657600,2,374,4.208333333333333
557590,5,6303076769,"This fabulous video is an exciting, funny peak at the recording of the new broadway cast soundtrack of the classic musical. I love this video and highly reccomend it. I would just say if your really not a fan of anyone in the show or the music the video will get tiresome, otherwise, go for it.",982454400,5,294,4.267857142857143
7837104,5,6303076769,Terrific documentary about an equally terrific Broadway revival.  Faith Prince is remarkable and a true star!!!,1495152000,,111,5.9375
7837105,5,6303076769,"G&D is so old there is a danger in its actors giving the aura of ""taking it for granted"". But not with THIS cast of
the best of Broadway's stars. The show was a mega hit in its most recent stage appearance in New York City and
for a change, someone decided to capture the recording of the music album for CD, and turned it into a television
most-watched program that resulted in the recording of the ""soundtrack"" being captured for television. For the actor
this is a lesson in working on a musical, and for the producer, instrumentalists, and others interested in how Broadway
shows' music gets committed to CD, this is a don't miss.  All the stars - JK Simmons, Nathan Lane, Faith Prince, etc., are the
known pros of Broadway who gathered for this terrific performance which ran 1992-through 1995, and we are most fortunate
that the late Edward Strauss conducted, and that the well known actors signed on for the cast. This recording features all of
them in a video made right inside the studio during the sountdrack recording. It's a barrel of fun!",1430870400,,1051,4.590425531914893
7837106,5,6303076769,Nathan lane and faith prince are nathan detroit and adelaide personified.  Nobody else can come close to those two.  they should have made the movie remake.  peter gallagher and josie guzman are also good.  walter bobbie as nicely nicely is excellent.  chorus is dynamic .  suprised to see jk simmons of oz as great voice in chorus.  better than broadway productions recently.,1419292800,,376,4.967741935483871
7837107,3,6303076769,"The clips of the cast within recording sessions with the orshestra are nice, but I really wish there was footage of the songs then in place on stage. The very opening starts with a few clips from stage, then the rest of the video is just in the recording sessions.",1388102400,3,264,4.3
7837108,5,6303076769,"After you watch this you'll need to get the Loesser song book.  Short of being backstage during the original rehearsal this is a look at what it takes to put a unique evening together.  Audio is excellent, acting, and there is some, is tops.  The disc belongs in the library of any B'way fan. Not to be confused with the awful ""Guys and Dolls"" two CD thing.",1367107200,2,357,4.298507462686567
7837109,5,6303076769,"There's no doubt that Guys & Dolls is a Broadway classic. In this DVD, viewers get a glimpse behind the scenes of the recording of the cast album. Nathan Lane, Faith Prince, and dozens of wonderful performers will knock your socks off,",1363219200,2,235,4.619047619047619
7837110,5,6303076769,Great item.  Shipped quickly.  Very happy.  No problems.  My children were very pleased.  Guys and Dolls is one of their favorite musicals.,1355702400,,139,5.136363636363637
7837111,5,6303076769,"What a great opportunity for a behind-the-scenes look at the recording of the cast album. If you enjoy Broadway shows, and this one in particular, you'll swoon over the performances here. Great insights into how to decide what is good enough, and what happens when there are directorial disagreements behind the scenes - if you're good, you have your own ideas, but who wins out? More than anything, it's the performers who win you over with their fabulous vocals and style...and some surprise faces in the cast, of actors you didn't know were singers. Faith Prince is amazing!",1355097600,,577,4.8979591836734695
7837112,5,6303076769,"This is an excellent dvd with a backstage inside feel to a great Broadway cast and show.  The making of the cast cd captures the well defined music, personalities and vitality that made this stellar cast and production of Loesser's ""Guy's & Dolls"", the great classic that it is.",1284940800,,278,4.673469387755102
7837113,5,6303076769,"I remember watching this video in 1992 on television.  I had to own it and found it on Amazon.  Not only is the music a joy to listen to, the cast recreates this legendary American Broadway musical with great passion.  You get to see a younger Nathan Lane and Peter Gallagher plus other Broadway professionals (actors, actresses, musicians, sound crew) working together. I recommend this DVD to any viewer who appreciates the work of theatre- a must for those who collect.",1266364800,4,472,4.802469135802469
