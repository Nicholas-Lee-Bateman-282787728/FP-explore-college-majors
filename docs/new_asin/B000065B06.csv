7961323,5,B000065B06,"The All Night Long series is a collection of Japanese flicks from the 90's that still remain some of the most disturbing movies ever made. This one (the first in the series and the most mild of the three) plays out as more of a study of insanity and a drama film then an all-out gore fest or horror film, although it does have it's moments of gory goodness. It's pretty much a revenge film done the Japanese way. The story is about three misfits who witness a murder and become good friends. They plan a party and invite some girls, after a long night of planning and humiliation they decide to take out revenge on those who wronged them. The characters all start off as somewhat normal kids as this film follows their slow descent into insanity up until the very violent finally. I recommend buying the whole All Night Long collection, all three films are some of my all time favorites and the price is right. Fans of Takshi Miike should really take notice. Highly recommended!",1214524800,8,978,4.5

This is one of the best Asian horror films I have seen, and I have seen quite a few.  Not for the squeemish, it is filled with extremely realistic scenes of rape and torture.  It is basically the story of how three reasonably normal teenagers decend into madness with horrifying results.

More disturbing than Audition...if you enjoy ultra violent horror movies then this is a must see.",1160352000,6,598,4.766990291262136
