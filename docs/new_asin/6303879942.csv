7854363,3,6303879942,I only got this for Michael Ironside and Terri Hawkes (the voice of Sailor Moon).,1477440000,,81,4.466666666666667
7854364,3,6303879942,"This movie has a very slow opening. The theme or plot is dull and poorly directed. Jeff's fighting style is not displayed as it is in Martial Law. It appears the only good thing that comes out of this movies is what was actually going on in the 1980's and 1990's about gays and HIV. The powers to be didn't want people to know that AIDS was spread to heterosexuals via bisexual activities and intervenes drug us. So, hence get rid of the researcher and gay activists whom were slowly infiltrating the political system with a powerful negative influence. Jeff is the do it all or die yourself i.e. ""forced killer"". He does a half witted job and gets people whom he likes killed by not thinking. For a former skilled killer he doesn't think ahead of time.  As an actor -Jeff is better than this movie and a skilled martial artists he is way better than this movie.",1408233600,,862,4.421383647798742
7854365,3,6303879942,"Jeff Wincott was the golden boy of direct-to-video martial arts flicks in the early 90s, producing upbeat karate fare that was as good and better than what Van Damme and Seagal were making. However, after 1994, his movies became noticeably darker. Storylines turned nihilistic and fight scenes lost their flare. ""The Killing Man"" is the first among this trend, featuring a plot better suited to a thriller than an action feature and noticeably less impressive martial arts. It's a decent movie, but it's a shade of Wincott that doesn't appeal to me.

The story: A hitman (Wincott) awakens in the clutches of a shady government organization that uses him to cover up a nationwide conspiracy.

Part of the reason for Jeff's turn towards this murkier style of movie has to do with his association with filmmaker Damian Lee, who would direct several of Wincott's future films. He only produces this one, but his influence is all over the picture, given the frequency and bitterness of the assassination scenes. I appreciate the how few of the deaths are treated as secondary, but that doesn't keep them from being frequent or depressing.

The action could be better. Wincott's future fight scenes would suffer even more under his partnership with Lee (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Street-Law/dp/B00000JN30/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Street Law</a>), but here, they're already disappointing. Jeff's opponents include kung fu practitioner Rupert Harvey and MMA competitor David Campbell, but neither the fights with them nor anyone else are satisfying. It's clear that the brawls were shot in many segments, with genuine disharmony between the shots in addition to the jerky choreography. Better handled are the shootouts, particularly the long finale. Similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taxi-Driver/dp/0767830555/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taxi Driver</a>, every single gunshot has clearly been well plotted. This skillful moderation is admirable.

Jeff gets to show off his acting potential well, and he's supported nicely by lead villain Michael Ironside (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Total-Recall/dp/B00070FX5U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Total Recall</a>) - a guy who can do this kind of stuff in his sleep. Love interest Terri Hawkes (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hello-Mary-Lou-Prom-Night-II/dp/B0013K2ZFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II</a>) isn't consistent, but does well in her limited role. Cumulatively, I'm not satisfied. I wish the filmmakers had made either a straight action flick or a pure thriller, because while the mixture has its highlights, it could have been much better.",1406160000,,2796,6.31151832460733
7854366,4,6303879942,This is one of Jeff Wincott's best action movies as star - with a little more thought in the story and less emphasis on his martial arts moves. Good action movie.,1361836800,,162,4.258064516129032
7854367,4,6303879942,"I purchased Killing Man for one simple reason - Jeff Wincott.  I have been constantly impressed with this guy's solid martial arts skills, and ability to actually act well.  Thinkin that Killing Man would be another Wincott action blast with some decent acting and an ok story, the movie provided a from of entertainment I did not see coming.

Instead of an all-out action fest, Killing Man felt a lot more like a suspense/thriller with the action thrown in.  Jeff Wincott, though does not give a martial arts filled movie like many of his others, instead delivers a sharp performance in acting and creating a unique and defined charcater, ""Harlin Garrett"" aka ""The Killing Man"".  Saved from death by a so-called branch of the government led by Mr. Green (Michael Ironside), Harlin is basically brainwashed to kill and eliminate the slime of society in order to stay alive.  Finding it difficult to grasp at first, Harlin begins to fall into the habit, until he falls for a woman he has been ordered to kill.  This is where the movie gets very exicitng.

In addition to Wincott, the supporting actors do a better job than expected for a low-budget B movie.  Michael Ironside, as always, delivers a solid performance as the bad guy.  Killing Man has a dark tone throughout, and begins especially eerie in a dark and desolate hospital for Harlin.  I enjoyed the fact that Harlin falls for an ordinary girl, and not some usual blonde bimbo.

Overall, Killing Man is not a martial arts film, and very little action film at that.  While there is some action throughout, it is very real and timed out with the story.  All together, it works well.  Expect good suspense upon watching the first time, and one of Jeff Wincott's best acting performances so far.",1182211200,2,1751,4.732673267326732
7854368,4,6303879942,"THE KILLING MAN is dark, atmospheric and surprising.  Jeff Wincott, who has made a career out of playing B movie action heroes, is at his best.  He plays a mob hitman who awakens in a strange government facility, with a new face and an ominous future awaiting him.  The government ""agent"" played by Michael Ironside (in one of his most effective recent roles) is planning on using Wincott to wipe out some people he says are dangerous to the government.

The movie rests on the new Wincott:  is he still the heartless, cold killing machine or does he really want to change and start a new life.  There are some tense action scenes, good fights, and crisp direction.  The ending is somewhat of a downer, and it caught me by surprise, but that's what takes this movie up a notch.  It's not that predictable.",1095984000,,805,4.541666666666667
7854369,3,6303879942,""" I feel pain, I must be alive"" begins this movie as a mob killer awakes in the care of an autonomous government agency that has nursed him back to health after a deadly fire in which he was thought to have been killed. They plan to use him for several hits on scientists who have discovered AIDS to be a laboratory created disease. Though it's never said, you get the sense that they will either kill him or expose him after he does the last hit who happens to be a cutie doctor. So you can probably guess what happens in the end, but all in all it's an interesting story worth viewing if you like this type of flick.
The one bad thing about this DVD is the sound and picture quality, it's not that great (kinda dark and grainy), but  acceptable... I can't really complain.",976924800,4,774,4.22972972972973
7854370,5,6303879942,"This is a though-provoking movie shot in a very interesting manner.  The content is a bit eery, but the quality is superior for a B-action flick.  Jeff Wincott is great in his performance, as in all his works, and is way  too under-rated.  I would rent this one again.  Wincott flicks are always  worth the viewing.  The storyline is captivating and the end is anything  but uplifting, but it keeps your attention.",950054400,,414,4.652777777777778
