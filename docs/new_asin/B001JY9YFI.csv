8447966,5,B001JY9YFI,This classic movie is a very enjoyable watch. It is full of hysterical hijinx and tender moments. The story is that a family is hurting for money until a mafia boss comes their way after successfully robbing a bank. The family learns of this and attempt to kill off the mafia boss to keep the cash... but things don't go as planned. I truly recommend watching this movie for a good laugh and great evening. Unfortunately I didn't watch it with subtitles so I don't know if they're available or any good.,1390694400,2,503,4.478260869565218
