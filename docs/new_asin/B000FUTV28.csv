2591115,4,B000FUTV28,"I'm a fan of Tomaselli's earlier work `Horror', but had read some bad reviews on Satan's Playground.  I decided to let the movie stand for itself and picked it up.  I'm glad I did.  There's no doubt that different people are looking for different things in a horror movie, and this one really delivered the goods for me.  They made a very intelligent choice in not showing the Jersey Devil.  This forces the viewer to use their imagination, which will always be far worse than anything shown on the screen.  The actors were convincing in every way, from creepy as hell to just plain rude.  Danny Lopes was excellent as Sean the autistic boy.  Give this movie a try and see if you like it, I'll wager that you'll be quite surprised in how intelligent and well made an independent film can be.",1159833600,3,791,4.4825174825174825
2591116,2,B000FUTV28,"I was SO looking forward to seeing this. Had read some very promising reviews (although it seems that people involved with the production like to write rave reviews all over the place for Dante's films!).

I could overlook the ropey acting and the cliches if the film actually went anywhere.

It has the lamest plotline and ending that I've seen in a film for years. Yes it does capture a feel of horror films from days gone by but unfortunately, it's all the sucky ones!

Ellen Sandweiss should have saved her return for something better!",1159747200,5,539,4.652631578947369
2591117,5,B000FUTV28,"SATAN'S PLAYGROUND is the celluloid equivalent of one of those old fashioned wooden turntables they sell at Sharper Image. The turntable is bedecked with a newfangled cd and mp3 player but it plays ""records"" and ""45's"" of a bygone era. SATANS PLAYGROUND is-like that record player-a beautifully crafted hybrid of old time horror potently mixed with the latest tricks of the trade. It's a retro tv program beamed through an iPod.

Director Dante Tomaselli's third feature in 6 years is a begiling stew of maniacal old women, a family in jeopardy and the Jersey Devil lore. A priceless performance by veteran Irma St. Paule-she is the actress who cursed the character in STEPHEN KING'S THINNER- sets this sleek horror engine in motion and for nearly 90 minutes never runs out of gas.

Tomaselli's storytelling is a campfire tale gone awry. Like those childhood stories it was never the tale being told that compelled you to listen till the end-it was how it was told and the twists and turns it took to reach  a shocking ending. You never are quite sure what will happen to these characters and no rules are followed. The director bludgeons the viewer with set pieces that stay with you long after the movie fades to black. Disturbing scenes of torture, babies in peril and an overall feeling of dread render this a unique viewing experience. While Tomaselli's detractors have felt he's lacking in the scenarist department(who is more nonlinear and slight on dialogue than the revered David Lynch?)-his painterly, mystifying and bewildering visual power resonates . His film is a blank canvas saturated with visceral brilliance .

Shorn of all it's pungent visuals, SATANS PLAYGROUND is still your Daddy's horror film. From the outdoor 70s setting, to the amazing score and including the use of modern day horror icons-Ellen Sandweiss from THE EVIL DEAD, Felissa Rose from SLEEPAWAY CAMP and Edwin Neal from the original TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE -Tomaselli winks at his knowing audience who grew up on seeing these stars from countless trips to their local video store. By heaving no sense of place or time in his movie-the director gives his viewers=brilliantly-a comfort zone of recognition and all the baggage that comes with it. It adds a layer of backstory and texture that most new modern horror movies are seriously lacking.

Felissa Rose is back with an elegant vengeance in a role far removed from Angela in SLEEPAWAY CAMP. While there's no questioning her gender here- for a woman she still has balls. Rose is a 2006 scream queen that is maimed and tortured and still perseveres. She pulls off a complex role of mother of a autistic teenager and Satanic battler very nicely. Ellen Sandweiss is back in the woods a quarter of a  century after THE EVIL DEAD. It's a surprising, subtle performance that is the most sympathetic of all. Sandweiss is still a looker and Mothers everywhere can relate to her arc here. Neal looks as if he walked off the TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE set right on to Tomaselli's without skipping a beat. He defies the test of time and is quite good as a misunderstood monster of a villain. The aforementioned Irma St Paule is the blackened heart of the piece-a frantically throbbing performance. In a small but pivotal role, Christie Sanford scares you senseless as the child/woman that is in her own world. It's a chilling role and Sanford who has worked with Tomaselli on 3 movies-seems to have an iron clad patent on kooks-and she does it brilliantly. Also a vteran of Tomaselli's three features is the handsome, bewitching Danny Lopes as the autistic teen. Lopes' role is nearly mute but he conveys to the audience a true portrait of a person locked in a prison he cannot escape. Felissa Rose is his mother-her character is as tortured ouwarfly as Sean the teen is tortured internally. lopes has a future-he command sympathy in a very unsympathetic film. He's the tootsie roll center of this tootsie pop film-all gooey and warm and hard to reach in the cany colored, hardened shell which is the films tone.

SATANS PLAYGROUND is a feast for the eyes and ears. It recaptures the feel of a Seventies horror classic while being an upwardly mobile horror film of the now and the future. It is scary, thoughtprovoking, manipulative fun that will disturb you and give you nightmares. Horror has been thriving as of late-not surprising as its a catharsis for the true horror in the world we live in. SATANS PLAYGROUND =if you go into it with no expectations-will wallop you senseless. For those of u who know Tomaselli's previous films-HORROR and DESECRATION-we have the privilege of seeing a talent form before our eyes like a new pod in INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS. It looks like all the other horror films but has a sinister side to it that enthralls. A perfect Halloween treat.",1158192000,7,4807,4.840632603406326
2591118,3,B000FUTV28,"OK! First off I would like to let you all know that I am a huge fan of Dante Tomaselli's first two films so I really do not want to write this review,but as a horror film fan I must!
Satan's Playground is a cheesey low-budget funhouse of a flick but when one thinks of Director Dante Tomaselli & his previous works the word CHEESEY just doesn't quite belong. What I mean is that there was so much potential here between the Director & the cast & because his first couple of films are in my opinion brilliant I was expecting this to be another low-budget masterpiece & while it definitely has those very creepy moments,beautifully haunting visuals & the loony toon nightmare like incoherency that any true fan would expect from Dante,it just seems to have a real amateurish & flawfully thin story. It's not at all the cleche(crazy people in the woods)part or the story that bothers me because let's just be honest here,we are talking about the horror genre,I've seen plenty different versions of the same story that have turned out excellent,I mean that is why the horror genre is split up into sub-genres(slasher films,zombie films,monster films Ect.)but it's that the story is just filled with what seems to be intentional time taker-uppers. Don't get me wrong Mr Tomaselli is no stranger to intentional plot holes to screw with your head but these intentional plot holes seem like they were put there to add a kill or to make sure the movie came close enough to it's classic hour & a horror movie half running time. Once again don't get me wrong this film was reminisant of a nightmare like the maestro's other works,but my own nightmares don't have useless situations stuck in them just to make them last a little longer or to add a kill. I still did enjoy it for what it was wich is a four cheese low-budget creepfest & yes I am very glad to add another tomaselli film to my collection(especially for the cheap price!)but this huge Dante Tomaselli fan was definitely exspecting a bit more than what I got.",1158105600,,2009,4.598885793871866
2591119,1,B000FUTV28,"I picked this movie up at WAL MART for 19.79 plus tax.

2591120,1,B000FUTV28,"The creators of this film obviously have quite a few Amazon 'critics' on their payroll - LOL - this is EASILY one of the VERY WORST pieces of steaming dung I have even seen money spent on and put on film

Bad sets, HORRIBLE acting and direction that seems like it came out of a Life Cereal commercial from 1975.  I do not normally write reviews here on Amazon, but I feel the GUT WRENCHING URGE to do my part to STEER AS MANY PEOPLE AWAY FROM THIS AS I CAN.

This movie is truly terrible.  Not a ""good 'bad' move"", just [..].  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!",1157068800,4,550,4.102803738317757
2591121,2,B000FUTV28,"Alright. Just watched this movie this weekend.

I have in the past read reviews for other works of Dante Tomaselli, all seemingly quite good. While they may be,

I just don't understand the hype on this one. This has all

been done before and better aka: Hills have Eyes, TCM Remake,

TCM original, and any countless other number of off road scary family flicks.

Oh wait. Theres a catch. One of the freaky children has frequent flyer miles.

Okay so what have we got here from the Italian master.

A cliche old house by the woods- check

A nurse Ratchett wanna be- check

A crazy old woman- check

A retarded henchman son-check

I mean, someone please tell me, why was this movie made..except for the obvious financial reasons.

This is the work of a hack..not a renowned horror artist.

I will admit, I am not the know-it-all of horror I appear to be and I am sure countless number of horror movies have slipped by unnoticed under my discerning nose. However, I like most of you am a big fan of horror, and I cannot stand idly by when someone with as much talent (or so I've heard) as Mr. Tomaselli passes off a by the numbers horror flick.

Okay, lets first begin with the implausabilities of said horror flick:

Spoilers ahead- so read on only if you are not planning to watch this movie. I recommend you read on.

1. The family's car gets stuck in the mud.- Okay, I can buy

  that, but who does not have a cell phone in this day and age.

2. Every Time someone goes into the woods to make a call at that

  creepy house they dissapear. Hmmm..heres an idea. Why dont

  we wise up and stop going into creepy woods all by ourselves.

3. Cliche- Old crazy woman offers you a drink. Come on..who

  buys that line anymore.

4. If this is such a deserted place..where the helk did

  those hikers come from?

While all of these irrelevancies can be explained away as an attempt to further push the movie along, I for one was extremely dissapointed as to where the movie was being pushed.

Below are several other reasons why people may want to watch Dantes earlier works instead of this drivel.

1. You give me two hours of something swooping down

  and attacking people, and than I don't even get to see

  the darn thing. Close ups of cut faces and camera

  swooping does not a good movie make.

2. The nurse lady, not menacing. Highly stupid looking.

3. The general contempt for his audience. Come on Dante, we are

  hardcore horror fans who are renting here. Who the helk else

  is gonna pick up something called Devils Playground. Give us

  the horror that we deserve. Instead of two hours of cliches

  and non gory kills. Are you really going over the top by

  showcasing granny on crack and Killjoy the wicked Nurse. No.

So before I bore all of you with my over all dislike for this film I will say that this could have been a good movie.

The actors were good- genre favorites and the movie showed

some promise in the beginning.

I was expecting a sick, surreal thrill ride from a true master.

Instead, what I got was another grade B cheapie in another long line of straight to video drivel that is being put out these days.

Horror fans revolt!

Long Live Evil Dead!

Peace.",1156809600,5,3195,4.378657487091222

2591148,2,B000FUTV28,"...but not by much.

Pros
The soundtrack: The best thing about this film is the sound.  It is genuinely creepy at times and sets an aural mood that many films miss (I'm thinking of the bombastic sound of popular audience modern genre movies like Van Helsing).  The soundtrack deserves a better movie.

Not showing the Jersey Devil: The main beastie is never shown (although we do get plenty of cliched monster POV shots).  Given the low budget of the movie and the nature of the cons (see below) any creature would have undoubtedly looked horrible (as opposed to horrifying).

The setting:  The Pine Barrens lend themselves to unsettling imagery and the director can, at times, compose some nice shots.

The plot: The basic premise - that the Jersey Devil and the specters of the Leed's clan still haunt the woods - has promise and the flow of the plot - stupid vacationers get lost and are picked off one by one - while a standard of horror films, is a standard because it still works.  People often complain about characters in movies like this doing unrealistic things (e.g., wandering off by themselves, going back to a house they narrowly escaped from).  In reality, of course, people probably wouldn't do this sort of thing...and they also wouldn't encounter flying monsters or the ghosts of people dead for 300 years.

Cons - unfortunately, everything else in this movie is pretty bad.

Acting:  The actors are just not that good.  It was just painful watching endless scenes of people either running about screaming or mugging for the camera.

The villains: The Leed's family doesn't come across as creepy...just annoying.  In part, this is because of the bad acting.  In part, it is because an old woman and two grinning, giggling, mentally and physically handicapped, middle-aged people are not the stuff of nightmares.  They have no personality.  Also, they mainly kill people with what looks like a croquet mallet.  Sorry, but if you are trying to make a throw back to the slasher movies of the 70s and 80s, stick with a chainsaw; it is a classic for a reason.

Mrs. Leeds: One thing the director needs to be told; close-ups of an old woman's face do not equal transcendent horror.

Cinematography:  While one can - and should - make allowances for lower budget movies, this film is still poorly shot.  Little visual tension is built and, while the Pine Barrens are interesting visually, most of the movie takes place in a house.

Boring cliches:  Cliches are not necessarily bad.  The whole wandering off alone is a genre standard and yet still works to some degree because that helps build the feel of the ""alone in a haunted house"" feel that these films try to achieve.  However, minutes spent watching some woman run about in the woods screaming is a cliche that is not entertaining.

Story holes"" While the basic plot has some promise, the actual story has some numerous ""WTF"" moments.  I'll use on as an example.  Our protagonists' car breaks down on a deserted road. One by one, people wander off.  At some point, a police officer shows up in at the haunted house then heads back to his car and is attacked by the Jersey Devil.  Fine...except in a later shot we see that the police car is parked about 30 meters from the protagonists' car...and that the officer apparently ignored this vehicle (and the woman sitting inside at the time) and that she never heard the officer being mauled.

Summary: Basically, this is a waste of time and money.  While there are a few moments when a truly creepy mood is created, they are so few and far between - and the filler is so bad - that they are simply not worth the effort.  The film is not frightening, it is not particularly gory, it is hampered by poor acting and a somnabulant pace and the story has many, many problems.  A Jersey Devil movie certainly has promise...but this one is not it.",1185321600,5,3855,4.666172106824926

2591153,3,B000FUTV28,"Dante Tomaselli's third film is a psychadelic campfire tale. It's grim, lush, creepy in some parts and funny in others.

Taking the familiar 'getaway gone to hell' setup, we meet the Bruno family, circa 1980-83; consisting of Donna(Felissa Rose of SLEEPAWAY CAMP), her autistic son Sean(Danny Lopes), Paula(Ellen EVIL DEAD Sandweiss!) and her newborn Anthony, and grumpy Frank(Salvatore Paul Piro). It's clear right off the bat that the trip is getting tense, and the family's dysfunctions aren't helped by a cramped car ride through the Barrens.

During a near-accident, Paula and Sean are terrified by a shadow that seems to fly over the station wagon, and the family discovers an abandoned general store with money still in the register and claw marks on the wall..they get points from me for quickly bailing though.

Later, the car dies(naturally) and Sean seems to perceive something in the treetops peering down at them.  Frank goes for help, and the one house with lights on is the one house he should never have stopped at.

""Are you hear for a reading?"" croaks Mrs. Leeds(Irma St. Paule), a weathered gypsy/palm reader who coaxes Frank into a disgusting back room, which he will never come out of. Donna, frustrated, goes to look for Frank, and one by one like lambs to the slaughter, one dysfunctional family will meet THE dysfunctional family...who will survive and what will be left of them?

Old-school and loving it, with nods to the 70's-80's classic scare films, director Tomaselli takes his time setting up the foreboding mood...you constantly feel that something is watching and following from above...the woods is as important a character as any of the cast here, and one gets the feeling that everything that happens here is the result of that woods' influence. From Mrs. Leeds' murderous children to the unseen beast that slaughters passersby, to strange hooded men conducting sacrifices, the Barrens twists the minds of all who pass through it.

Dante further explores the themes he tapped into in his earlier films DESECRATION and HORROR; broken family dynamics, people stuck in childhood, trauma manifesting as supernatural violence- but this time keeps the narrative straightforward and unambiguous. People who may have liked the imagery and design of his previous films but didn't follow the dream-logic will be able to follow this one quite well. It's a simple, nasty setup where the cast list keeps shrinking as the minutes tick off.

With all the madness going on, it's not suprising that he decided not to keep a straight face..there's a twisted sense of playfulness here, not as dead-serious as Dante's past films. Irma St. Paule as Mrs. Leeds (the woman who, in folklore, birthed the Jersey Devil) is alternately a creepy, campy hoot-every time she comes to the door you're not sure what to expect. There's a hilarious scene where ANOTHER random traveler stops at the Leeds house looking for a phone and bumps into a terrified member of the Bruno family begging for help, and gets scared off! It's the type of humor that actually can work in a horror film, it comes naturally out of the situation and isn't shoehorned in like most of the forced jokes in the BOOGEYMAN-era of fake fear films.

Make no mistake here though, it's no comedy. An abduction sequence is particularly chilling. The violence is cringe-inducing, with a lot of people on the recieving end of mallets, cleavers, and rocks. Most of the grue is offscreen, save one moment that will have the gorehounds punching the air in delight.

The cinematographer makes this $500,000 indie look like 5 million plus.  On the cast side, though I wish we got to know them better before they start losing body parts, it's a minor quibble; Felissa is great, she's magnetic and manages to find shading in a character that has to spend nearly the entire film terrified. Lopes is intriguing as her mentally challenged son but his role is brief.  Can I say what a joy it is to see Ellen Sandweiss running through the woods again after 20 years offscreen?  Christie Sanford, a regular in DT's films, plays a sinister womanchild made up like a doll who would like nothing more than to play croquet with your head. Ed Neal gets to play backwoods psycho, I wish we saw more of him. Piro is fun as the head of the family and gets some of the best lines, while Ron Millkie cameos as the world's most ignorant cop.

Overall, it's a fine f**ked-up freakshow.",1162771200,3,4430,4.865869853917663

Felissa Rose (SLEEPAWAY CAMP, HORROR) and Ellen Sandweiss (THE EVIL DEAD, BRUTAL MASSACRE: A COMEDY) play sisters who find themselves -along w/ Sandweiss' baby and Rose's husband and autistic son- stuck, lost, and under relentless attack by an unimaginable force of eeevil. Tomaselli's signature paranoia, claustrophobia, and psychosis soak the atmosphere. Edwin Neal (yep, that creepy hitchhiker guy from the original TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE) plays what amounts to a reprise of that role. Irma St. Paul plays the ancient, deceptively wicked Mrs. Leeds. Filmed in the Pine Barrens, Tomaselli makes the woods come alive w/ sweeping, lunging camera work.

8127062,1,B000FUTV28,"After watching five-star gems like PIG HUNT and SPLINTERS, I suddenly found myself watching a grade-z travesty like this one.
I hope the movie-maker paid director Tobe Hooper some of the profits since SATAN'S PLAYGROUND lifts its whole concept from Hooper's fantastic movie masterpiece, TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE--even borrowing one of Chainsaw's main character's, Ed Neal.
We have the usual travelers stopping their car in the middle of the woods because they're either lost or need gas. The driver, a man so overweight and old turns out to be the husband of the heroine, played with dull, grungy style by Felissa Rose. Of course, the house has its Chainsaw nutjobs. We see a tall figure wearing Satan's clothes and there's something about a large bird that we never see flapping its wings.
Everyone ends up in a horrible death but in the meantime, we have this non-stop shrieking of Felissa Rose as she runs around with little direction and she looks more horrible by the minute.
In this movie, the people are all plain, ugly, and the women spend their time screaming and screaming when at times you wonder why since they alert their enemies to their whereabouts.
In one loopy sequence, a policeman is driving through the woods and stops his car in front of the stranded car of the family and without looking in, he goes to the crazy house and asks the white-haired loon about screaming he's heard. Why, what screaming, she chirps. He turns away an dis attacked by the invisible flying bird. Then we discover that a mother and child have been in the stranded car the whole time. She awakens and then goes in search of her missing family. She ignores the police car and comes to a, what else, bad end.
The whole look of this movie looks badly photographed, with non-existent lighting, make-up, wardrobe and it reminds me of a high school production.
We never see the monster bird. Felissa Rose has to be one of the most unattractive heroines in B-horror history. In her stove-pipe jeans, fly-away hair and relentless screaming, I finally shut the movie off and had no interest to see if she escaped or not.",1365638400,,2105,4.754098360655738

I have long been a defender of Dante Tomaselli's work, having seen, and liked, both 1999's <em>Desecration</em> and 2002's <em>Horror</em>. I grant you, Tomaselli's movies are an acquired taste, even if you're used to no-budget horror with amateurish special effects and bad acting, but let's face it: watching a Dante Tomaselli movie on a loop for an entire week is better than watching one minute of pretty much any movie that has ever been produced by The Asylum. You know this is true. And so we come to Tomaselli's third feature, <em>Satan's Playground</em>. It's got some of the Tomaselli hallmarks (most notably, the fact that very little of this makes sense, as if Tomaselli woke up from a nightmare, transcribed it, and then never revised), but this movie had a bigger budget, got some name stars, and has a more straightforward plot than usual. It may have been an attempt to take the Tomaselli name to a wider audience. If so, I think it failed pretty miserably, but if you're an established Tomaselli fan, this is good stuff.

We start off with a family driving through the New Jersey woods. Pieces of a family, anyway. There's grandpa (<em>Sleepers</em>' Salvatore Paul Piro), his two daughters Donna (<em>Sleepaway Camp</em>'s Felissa Rose) and Paula (<em>The Evil Dead</em>'s Ellen Sandweiss), and Paula's infant son Anthony (Marco Rose). I'm not entirely sure where they're going; if it's mentioned, I don't remember. In any case, they break down in the woods, there's a house nearby, you know the drill. That scenario never ends well. In this case, the house is inhabited by a psychotic palm reader with a taste for human flesh and her crazy kids, who take the family in one by one as they go looking for help.

Despite having some actors anyone in the horror community is going to be familiar with (Raine Brown also turns up in a small role), if you ever wondered why Felissa Rose hasn't done much acting outside the Sleepaway Camp movies or Ellen Sandweiss didn't make a movie between 1982 and 2006, watching this will tell you. Still, bad acting is to be expected from a Tomaselli joint, as are the inevitable plot holes and bits that simply don't make sense. And if you take this with the nightmare angle I described earlier, you may be able to get your head around it. There are precious few of us who can, but you may be one. ***",1325116800,,2413,4.809638554216868

It's Just a bunch of Jersey/New York Trash with annoying accents. Nothing Scary.",1288915200,,163,4.857142857142857
8127065,1,B000FUTV28,"""Satan's Playground"" is surreal garbage, a waste of celluloid and an idiotic crime against horror cinema. It has a totally convoluted plot. It has idiotic, poorly-written, unlikable, and anyeurism-inducingly annoying characters. Tension is non-existant. Special FX are non-existant, and the hyped-up Jersey Devil appears as nothing more than a poorly-rendered CGI flash. ""Evil Dead"" alluminite Ellen Sandweiss and ""Sleepaway Camp"" star Felissa Rose are painfully wasted as garbage characters. This movie is the bane of the low-budget, straight-to-video universe. Thanks to this moronic, clueless, pitiful and pathetic excuse for a horror film, I have become extra cautious when searching for a decent horror movie on the video shelves. It used to be that I grabbed anything that looked interesting, and though most of what I got was lousy, I'd occasionally come across a gem or two. I was in the same state of mind when I rented this insipid dust speck. Thanks to this movie, I almost never rent any sort of STV horror release nowadays. Due to my over-caution, I've probably passed up real movies that deserved my attention. Dante Tomaselli, you owe me an apology you pretentious hack.",1286841600,,1185,5.242105263157895
