8561569,5,9790371152,"This was a great DVD. It showed how to make a basic pair....from initial measuring to completion. Then it went on to show variations and beautiful beading as well.
Highly recommend this to anyone wanting to make footwear. I made a sample pair from fleece to test my pattern and it fits perfectly. Plan to do leather next then go on to another pair with some beadwork. My feet are short and wide so it is great to be able to make moccasins that fit me!",1300838400,7,451,4.255813953488372
