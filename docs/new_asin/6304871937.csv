This movie is a must to see because contains historical and cultural values about the modern Mexican society. The movie story tries to reflect the differences among Mexican social classes and how the rich and poor people behave and live, especially the people in Mexico City.

This film it is not recommend for those whom don't understand modern Mexican culture and Mexico City Slang. Otherwise, watch this movie as it, could generate cultural misunderstandings.

It is a collectors pick because it is an item very difficult to find.",1297987200,,702,4.841666666666667
