8726798,2,B012YPV0O8,"Hum,  Miss Congeniality skips so badly it's barely watchable, so that was a waste.  I'm thinking it's the packaging, nothing between any of the disc's to protect them.  Second disc, Miss Congeniality 2, skipped a bit, but fast forwarding and backing up seems to have relieved that.  Haven't watched the other three yet.  Should have been a good buy.  Not so much so far though.",1461024000,2,377,4.723076923076923
