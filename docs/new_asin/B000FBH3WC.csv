2559589,3,B000FBH3WC,"I give the sitcom itself 4-5 stars.  It's great and creative within it's simplicity and I especially enjoy the episodes where the great supporting cast (spence, deacon, lou ferigno, etc) have a lot.  Stiller is as always brilliant.  My problem is with the dvd collection itself which unfortunately has ALOT of repeat episodes in the volumes.  For instance in the 5th season DVD set at least half of the contained footage is from previous seasons.  This goes for all the other sets as well so you'll have to pick and choose the episodes from the menus as u go along just to avoid having seen the same episode 3 times or more depending on what season you have.  Wish each season only had THAT season's episodes on it.  Of coarse if they did it that way there'd probably only be one cd per season and maybe they figured they could charge more if they did it this way.  I'd give the dvd's one star for that and give it all three stars to average it out.",1151798400,6,949,4.3522727272727275
2559590,5,B000FBH3WC,I've been waiting for the 5th season to come out! Finally! I think this is the best show EVER - with my old favorite being Seinfeld...Keep them coming !!,1149379200,3,153,4.310344827586207
2559591,5,B000FBH3WC,King of Queens is the funniest show on tv. Season five is one great laugh after another. I hope it runs for 10 more years. Hey Sony...release the past seasons quicker.,1147910400,5,167,4.419354838709677
2559592,5,B000FBH3WC,"Like everyone else, I'm curious why this release took so long - but having said that - I'm DELIGHTED to know it will be here soon!!! This is genius comedy - which easily rivals Seinfeld. Kevin James' timing and delivery are impeccable, and Jerry Stiller is a proven master!!! And, like Seinfeld, the lines are so quotable! There's no better comedy on television today.",1146960000,11,368,4.765625
2559593,5,B000FBH3WC,"I have to add my review with everyone else,this is the Best & Funniest show that has ever been on! Not one episode goes by that I'm not laughing until I cry!!  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that this show gets renewed this season. And along with the rest,Please release Season 6 a lot faster than this one!!",1146182400,10,308,4.310344827586207
2559594,5,B000FBH3WC,"I just wanted to say IT'S ABOUT TIME SONY!! No disrespect intended.  But come on, why did it take so long to release season five?? I'm counting down the days until June 27 when it will arrive in my mailbox.  I'm hoping and praying that it doesn't take this long for them to release season 6.  So many crappy shows have their DVD sets released already..and King Of Queens blows them all away...the network should hang on to them for at LEAST 10 more seasons!! I am a DVD season set collector or ""junky"" if you will, and I am relieved season 5 is finally out!",1145577600,9,557,4.235849056603773
2559595,5,B000FBH3WC,"Why it took Sony a whole year to release season 5, from the release of season 4, is beyond me, whereas other TV shows' seasons are released much faster.  Season 5 is a great season.  The episode ""Arthur Spooner"" is one of my favorites from it.  Let's hope more seasons are released in a faster time frame!",1144886400,7,305,4.315789473684211
2559596,5,B000FBH3WC,"My name is Ben McCosker, and I'm from England. King of Queens has not been given the most prominent time-slot on our terrestrial channel four over here, so it probably hasn't acquired the audience it deserves. The Paramount Comedy Channel has treated it very well however. It is a fantastic show. Kevin James, Leah Remini and Jerry Stiller do excellent work and are believable as a family unit.

Unfortunately, I can't submit an episode list for this set because over here, the show is on daily-which is great-but it is hard to know when one season ends and another begins, unlike shows that are syndicated successively, an episode per week.

I can only vouch that it is a fantastically funny show. I have seasons one and two on dvd and intend to collect them all-I just can't afford them all at once, which is a shame.

One of my favourite lines from the show is from the season 2 premiere ""Queasy Rider"". Kevin James' character, 'Doug', and Jerry Stiller's character, 'Arthur', are discussing motorcycles and Arthur remarks on the,

""comradery of your gang brothers""

Doug is naturally surprised by this and proceeds to ask Arthur if he was in a gang, to which Arthur replies,

""not really...I asked them to let me in, but they drank heavily all weekend and beat me pretty severely.""

absolutely golden! If you love good comedy, you'll love the King of Queens and should purchase seasons one through as many as they manufacture!

CBS, if you ever read these reviews, you should definitely renew King of Queens for this fall, it's brilliant and you know it!

2559629,2,B000FBH3WC,"While I did not expect the DVD to be HD quality (for obvious reasons, the show was not filmed in HD) I did expect the DVD to at least match what I saw on TV. Unfortunately this DVD set looked worse than the TV version. I have purchased various other TV shows on DVD and have received about what I expected. I'm not sure if the local stations are up-sampling to get a better level of quality, but the DVD was not only grainy but the color/contrast was completely sub-par. I tried viewing this on 1) Projection TV, 2) LCD TV, 3) Computer LED laptop. All of which are Sony. The intro to the DVD (when first inserted) was of VERY high quality (Sony logo, initial animations, etc). The DVD Menu looked ""ok"" as it was largely computer generated and static. Some episodes approached the quality level of the TV broadcast while others had HIGH contrast so much so that the faces of the people were blown out. The sound was of mediocre quality as well, lacking range and any form of low-end (bass) of any kind. Overall, would not recommend buying this.",1294617600,,1043,4.409326424870466

During their days, Doug's a parcel deliveryman and Carrie's a legal assistant; during their nights, they come home to Queens and Carrie's widowed father Arthur (Jerry Stiller) who lives with them.

Storylines follow the usual marital dispute route (e.g. home responsibilities, money and sex), dealings with the eccentric Arthur or Doug's best friends Deacon, Spence and cousin Danny. There are also quirky and hilarious episodes such as ""Holy Mackerel,"" where Carrie receives a bonus at work after praying in church, leading her and Doug to begin a ""prayer spree""; or ""Flash Photography,"" where a bored Doug uses the disposable camera provided to wedding guests to take a shocking photo.

As with previous seasons, viewers will be left wanting more!
