8468387,5,B004W47Z4O,"From a remarkable script by Tim Gallagher, ""Gerald"" offers new insights into contemporary American lives burdened with recession, loss and unemployment.  And no, that description is not intended to applaud a depressing art film.  ""Gerald"" provides optimism for better days ahead with a cast of actors who never reduce their everyday characters to stereotypes or bitter losers.  This sensitive film is a positive and reassuring experience that grows richer with every viewing.

The movie's namesake character depicted by Louis Mandylor suffers a blow to the head during his delivery, thanks to the bumbling hands of his mother's doctor (Mickey Rooney).
The bump affects Gerald for life.  When at 30, Gerald loses his mother, he mourns the loss of his protector and his family life.  Working class friends come to his rescue and embark on a mission that may uncover a secret family fortune awaiting him.  Along the way,  Gerald navigates a network of misfits from the neighborhood laundry mat to the corporate boardroom.  Though he seems to be a simpleton,  Gerald has a big heart that proves to be his barometer toward surprising revelations.

""Gerald"" is also full of revelations for audiences in need of humor and hope for the future.  Louis Mandylor delivers a performance as sensitive and subtly effective as the film.  He is one of today's most diversely talented and accomplished screen actors.  Writer Tim Gallagher's performances in the film are hilarious highlights among many delivered by the ensemble.  ""Gerald"" is a highly recommended antidote for a break from the challenges and stresses of real-life and for anyone in search of a great movie.  And who isn't?",1339200000,,1671,5.133333333333334
8468388,4,B004W47Z4O,Rented this movie as it looked a little different. Found it to be entertaining and inoffensive. While it is not the next Citizen Kane it is a good way to spend movie night with the family.,1318636800,4,188,4.25
8468389,4,B004W47Z4O,"I see a lot of big budget movies and I'm at the theater every week. I don't see too many independent films, but this is one that I did see and I liked it.

The writing has a sense of innocence to it that brings you into the film and creates characters that are believable enough that you almost forget you are watching a movie.

Louis Mandylor provides an entertaining performance as Gerald. The mannerisms and line delivery is clever. Plus Mandylor provides some true comedic relief with his physical performance.

Not all performance are spot on during this movie. There is a scene in a laundry mat that starts off innocent enough and has its clever elements, but then goes down hill once you meet the young lady that is trying to help Gerald. The one pick me up during the scene is when you get to meet the Police Officer played by Mark D. Espinoza (Those of you who are Beverly Hills, 90210 fans will remember him once you see Mark).

If you are use to going to the theater to see movies you can tell that Gerald is an independently made film. But don't let that stop you as the innocent comedy elements, the a cappella sound track, and the twist at that end make it worth watching. I say rent this and enjoy some light-hearted entertainment.",1317513600,2,1246,4.404347826086957
8468390,1,B004W47Z4O,"Wow.  My wife, pre-teen-age son, and I rented this movie based on the positive reviews here.  We were very dissapointed.  I love good indie films, but with ""Gerald,"" the acting and writing seemed to match the film's low budget.  The main premise of the movie required greater than normal suspension of disbelief; that's fine, but pulling that off requires top-notch writing and acting.  I didn't think the man who played Gerald was believable as a mentaly impaired man, as his acting was 100% evident at all times and seemed to draw upon nothing but cliches and stereotypes (no Rain Man here, not even close).  The characters of the lush and the transvestite were so cartoonish and one-note that they both seemed to have escaped a mid '90s Saturday Night Live skit.  We had to give up on this movie after a half hour or so and there were zero laughs among the three of us during that time.",1314576000,2,889,4.5886075949367084
8468391,5,B004W47Z4O,"This was a fun, witty and full of humor.  You will laugh from the start to the end with this movie. I found myself laughing out loud.  The storyline can be unpredictable at times which will have you thinking what next.  It is a comedy and love story (if one can really love a doll that much :) all in one.  Good movie to sit down with the kids and watch on a raining Sunday afternoon.",1307491200,,384,4.0131578947368425

8468393,5,B004W47Z4O,I watched this movie with my friends and family and we really enjoyed it. This is a very nice comic entertainer. We all loved the character Gerald in the movie. Two thumbs up.,1304640000,2,175,4.333333333333333
