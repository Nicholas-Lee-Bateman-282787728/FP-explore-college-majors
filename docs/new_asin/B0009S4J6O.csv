Every time I do this one I get a great workout, and I know it'll get even better as I work on mastering all the steps (which may take a while!).  If you're not interested in dancy moves, then I'd avoid this one, though.  I enjoy the fun of struttin' my stuff alone in my den with no one watching, but that might not appeal to some.  The video offers a warm up, 3 different cardio workouts, cool down, core work and stretch.  Each cardio section is around 30 minutes.  The instructors are great-- Laura has a real-woman body I can relate to, Melissa is totally fun and inspirational, and Mark is the kind of guy you'd meet on the stages of Broadway.  If you want a fun challenge, a great workout and goals to work for, give this a try.",1166832000,2,846,4.25
8066104,2,B0009S4J6O,"I can step much better than most people. I don't limit that skill to just things like this video where people do some step and punch exercise. Frankly, I find that a little wimpy. This DVD is good if you're fat and just need some exercise to keep from having a heart attack, but if you are a diversified stepper like I am, this doesn't do a whole lot. I am a triple threat stepper in that I can do this ninja steppin, I can put on a step show and I can throw down a devastating drop step in the paint.

In terms of the stepping up and down while punching, that is just second nature to me. I'm a cross between the karate skills of Daniel Larusso, circa KKII, and the pure butt kicking ability of Stephen Seagal in Hard to Kill. I'm what Our Lady Peace talks about in the song one man army.

As far as a step show, I finished second to Kappa Alpha Psi at the University of Mississippi fall '97 step show. Keep in mind they had like 15 guys out there, me and my cane were sailing solo. But I put on a show that they still talk about at step show conventions today.

My true area of expertise is the drop step. I'm not extremely tall, but if you get me the ball in the post I'm like a mini white Wilt Chamberlain, complete with the ability to sleep with a lot of women. I will get my man, or woman, on my hip and just throw a drop step on them that will make them pull a hammy, groin or fire alarm. I score every single time. There was one game when I played for the West Omaha Deathforce AAU team and I was being guarded by a 6-9 center named Cherk Punkslaps. I abused him for 48 points on 20-20 fg and 8-8 from the line. Yup, I'm everything your dad wishes you could have become.",1134950400,,1678,3.973293768545994
