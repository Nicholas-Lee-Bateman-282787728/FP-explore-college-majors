8584167,5,B00COVNH58,It's a great low budget film for Tariq Nasheed first feature film since he's best known for his hit documentary film series Hidden Colors formally as known the author of The Art Of Mackin I see reviews with most saying this film trash come on people you don't expect incredible acting with a horror flick film. I'm not being a Tariq Nasheed ass kisser,1473379200,2,351,4.5
8584168,5,B00COVNH58,"This is a low-budget film, but it doesn't try to be anything that it isn't.  The writers and directors do a great job of staying within their means and not tripping the movie up with the usual low-budget pitfalls of corny dialog and senseless scenes or senseless character actions.  Another reviewer says the group ""decided to walk home"" but there was a reason they were walking.  It wasn't just a random decision.  Everything made sense and progressed in a logical fashion.  I've definitely seen worse teen horror films (Unfriended, anyone?)  This was the director's first non-documentary film, and I thought it was really well-done for what it is.",1466121600,2,649,4.962962962962963
8584169,1,B00COVNH58,"This one was pretty bad, but at least it was worth a few laughs because it was so bad. The premise of the story is that scientists are trying to rid society of certain undesirables,in this case, the residents of a small Southern college town. The scientists release a substance that is supposed to slowly kill the residents. Instead, a middle school becomes ground zero for multiple deaths and the school is closed. Of course, some of the residents become zombies because of a problem with the substance.
Some residents also have gone missing in the town, but of course college students decide to walk the streets unconcerned about all the people who have just disappeared from the town. Needless to say, someone says ""I know a shortcut"" which leads a group to the middle school that is condemned but just ""happens"" to be unlocked. Surprise! They decide to explore the school and manage to get locked in...with zombies! Some members of the group run into a girl who had been reported missing. She explains that she has been trapped in the school for a week trying to hide from the zombies. Strangely, she is clean and well-groomed. Also, as you can guess, there is no way to contact anyone outside of the school.
There is a little more to this video, but that is the gist of it.
The video is funny bad and very predictable. I can't recommend this one.",1377302400,2,1351,4.586776859504132
8584170,2,B00COVNH58,"The Movie started off promising then broke down into a low budget mess.  The acting was subpar and disappointing, gave it 2 stars.",1376611200,,130,4.6521739130434785
8584171,3,B00COVNH58,"It wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, and it certainly wasn't the best I've ever seen. It kept me entertained while eating my popcorn.",1376265600,2,138,4.56
