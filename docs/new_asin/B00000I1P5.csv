I just kepted pushing him to show more.  It becomes so addicting and  the problem is that you want to see more than just 5 episodes.  This is a  great series about 3 goddesses and how they interact with this guy name  Keiichi.  It is a very touching, loving and even comedic series and I  recommend it to EVERYONE.",955584000,,468,4.111111111111111
1218564,5,B00000I1P5,"I must say I was quite impressed by this series. It may be a love story but it still has its funny scenes and some action thrown in as well. There is no doubt that anyone with an interest in Japanese Animation needs to  check out this series. But be warned, if you buy the first volume, you're  probably gonna want to buy the others. So do yourself a favor and buy all  5, it's worth the extra cash. My only complaint is that there were only 5  episodes...such a classic series deserves more volumes to its name.",951004800,,512,4.1938775510204085
1218565,5,B00000I1P5,"This is a classic Love story that is, In my opion, done very good.  I love this series very much.  The Animation is good, Sound is good (could be better, but it is a older anime), Music is great, and good story.  If you  love this series check out the SB Ah, My Goddess Series (check with your  local fan-sub clubs or Cons), just as good and twice as funny!  =)",944179200,2,361,4.014084507042254

7909245,2,B00000I1P5,"When I saw the annoucement of this re-issue I was very excited because OMG is my favourite anime series, and as I have the previous editions of the OVAs, I thought this collector's edition would a must have.

For instance, the price is expensive for a package that is not worthy enough, and three DVDs including pictures downloaded from internet, is very dissapointing.

This collector's edition USA edition is not worthy the price that is offered. To be sincere I prefer the Two-DVD edition.

disspointing!",1264896000,2,507,4.9411764705882355
7909246,5,B00000I1P5,"If your a Ah, my Goddess fan this is the collectors edition for you.  All the OVA episodes are there with a slew of extras to enjoy.  I highly recommend this DVD set for anyone who's into the series.",1245628800,,199,4.076923076923077
7909247,5,B00000I1P5,"Unlike most people it seems I found about the OVA series after I watched the 2 tv seasons. I do wish it had a few more episodes. It may say more to my hearing but the voice for belldandy sounds alot like the one from the TV series but I think the actress that did it in this series does the voice for Peorth in the TV series.

 This is the OVA series when I first found it I was not sure if it was the first tv season in a different box since I came to the series late. I also felt the reason belldandy recived Keiichi's phone call made alittle more sense to me. It was not the first time they had meet. Skuld does not seem to be as aggresive towards to Keiichi which I was suprised to see. This is compared to the TV series.",1219708800,,725,3.859060402684564
7909248,4,B00000I1P5,"This three-disc DVD set includes all of the episodes of the Oh My Goddess OVA series.  Oh My Goddess is a ""magical girlfriend"" series, with the main stars being Keiichi Morisato and Belldandy.  The series itself has excellent storytelling and animation.  The episodes were compelling, and left me wondering what would happen in the next episode.

However, I was rather disappointed in the bonus features for this set.  A lot of emphasis was put into including information in a slideshow format.  While that in and of itself isn't bad, it's the fact the viewer has no control over how quickly the slideshow goes by.  The only way to read everything on each screen is to keep hitting the ""back"" button on the remote, or pause on each page.

I would recommend this DVD set for the episodes, because the storytelling and the animation make this set worth the money you pay for it.",1212537600,,876,4.6797385620915035

I've seen nothing like it before or since! A must watch.",1168560000,3,263,4.617021276595745
7909251,5,B00000I1P5,"So what makes 'Oh My Goddess: The Collector's Edition' so special?

REMASTERED VIDEO QUALITY!

Thats right for the first time ever Animeigo have released the remastered version of 'Oh My Goddess'. The original release which was split over 2 dvds had very medicore quality with rainbowing, dot crawl and too much brightness.

Now for the first time you can see Belldandy and her friends the way they were meant to look. Colours now actually look saturated opposed to the washed out look of the previous dvd release.

Conclusion - Even if you bought the original dvd releases, you owe to yourself to upgrade and to see the huge difference in video quality.",1153094400,15,654,4.8125
7909252,5,B00000I1P5,"I have been a fan of anime and manga for many years now, but when I picked up an issue of the OMG manga, I was captivated.  It was like being introduced to the genre all over again, the anime, which I saw several years later was no different.  The story, stripped to its basic elements, is a love story between a young couple and the problems they suffer in their lives and relationship.  It may sound boring, but trust me, it isn't.
Keiichi, average college student and the butt of his dorm mates pranks gets abandoned again when the others go out.  He gets hungry and decides to get take out since the others have eaten everything in the building.  After several failed attempts, he tries again, dialing in a hurry and gets through to the Goddess Technical Helpline.  The Goddess, Belldandy, appears throuh the mirror and gratns him once wish, and what he wants, he gets.  He wishes to have her with him forever, and that he gets....
With Belldandy at his side, Keiichi soon learns that haviung a Goddess in your home is not always a good thing, especially one as sweet, intelligent, beautiful and polite as her.  It gets even worse when.... Well, that would be telling.
The animation, design work and soundtracks are excellent, almost completely flawless.  The subtitles are translated well (I have not seen the dubbed version as yet).  Kosuke Fujishima's work is both beautiful, emotional and funny, something for all the family once you are finished with Porco Rosso, Kiki's Delivery Service, Laputa and the rest.  You may leave this to the last to watch, but the best always is.",993859200,3,1584,4.661870503597123
7909253,5,B00000I1P5,"""Oh My Goddess!"" is very sweet, funny, and gentle. I think it would be appropriate to anyone of any age; boys and girls, men and women.  The animation is terrific and the character, machine, and background  designs are gorgeous.",967334400,,228,4.82051282051282
