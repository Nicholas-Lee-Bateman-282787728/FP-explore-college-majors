8231166,5,B000Y86NHC,"Made by X-Ray Films and first time director Brian Stillman Toys Are Us: A Revolution in Plastic is, at around half an hour, a modest but immensely enjoyable foray into the weird and wonderful world of designer toys. For those who know little about designer toys and vinyl figures Toys Are Us will be a fascinating introduction to what at first may seem an obscure underground arts movement, and for those in the know it will be a welcome validation of their passion for this truly exciting art form! For some time now I'd been eagerly waiting for this cool indie-documentary to finally be released, as it's one of the first tentative explorations in film of the art toy and urban vinyl phenomenon. The documentary focuses on the vinyl figure/urban vinyl element of the designer toy phenomenon as there's no doubt that it is, by and large, the most popular means of expression in the wider subculture... the superstar if you will. The modern designer toy movement began in Hong Kong and Japan in the late 1990s but as is discussed in this film its creative roots go back as far as the early 1980s, to a time when Japanese artists were trying to recreate the beloved toys of their childhood. It is also discussed how many fans and toy creators in the US often misperceive designer toys as a relatively new phenomenon, and how there seems to be a general unawareness of the true history of this art form. To me it comes as no surprise at all that designer toys had their aesthetic germination that early on considering that the Japanese have a prized history of making diecast tin and plastic toys, and also that they have a track record of taking seriously forms of expression that in the West are considered to be crude long before we have usually caught on. This gem of a film includes candid interviews with the likes of such creative luminaries as Tara McPherson, Frank Kozik, Patrick Ma, Erick Scarecrow, Mark Nagata, Mars-1, Voltaire, Nathan Jurevicius and many more as well as a few amusingly brief discussions with hyped up fans at trendy inner city gallery functions and the world famous San Diego Comic-Con.

There aren't many special features but I'm sure the few there are will keep you glued to the screen for a good hour or so. There are four extended interviews with Mario Martinez (aka Mars-1) Frank Kozik, Brian Flynn and Patrick Ma that are a revealing glimpse into the uniquely creative minds of these talented artists. The extended interview with Frank Kozik was especially fascinating for me as he comes across as the most articulate, insightful and surprisingly blunt of all four interviewees... although Patrick Ma certainly deserves special mention as well. A cool extra feature is the multimedia presentation of five bands whose music is featured in the documentary including songs, examples of album and poster art and some background info. This short yet funky documentary is one of the first to explore the intriguing world of this creative arts subculture and there are also at least another two in postproduction, and I'm sure that there will be many more to come. If like me you're obsessed with these adult playthings Toys Are Us: A Revolution in Plastic will be a must see and for those who are new to its bizarre and often challenging (but always stimulating) world where art and commerce merge, it should be more than enough to make you want to find out more.",1283558400,3,3392,4.739424703891709
