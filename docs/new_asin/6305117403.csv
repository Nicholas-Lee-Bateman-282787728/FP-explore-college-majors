982614,4,6305117403,"The correct title for this movie is ""Carry On Abroad"" and its a  solid entry in the series. The characters are archetypal ""Carry  On-ers"" - June Whitfield as the ""no sex, we're British""  housewife, Sid James as a husband with a permanently roving eye, Kenneth  Williams as the pernickety tour guide, Charles Hawtrey as the ""Mothers  Boy"" etc. Like other series entries, it belongs in the seaside  postcard, music hall tradition of obvious vulgarity in its spoof of  disasterous package tour holidays - a hotel with flooding waterworks,  bathrooms to be shared between two rooms, construction work that begins at  5am, plagues of mosquitoes in the dining room etc. And there's also that  priceless dialogue. For example, (a)Barbara Windsor: I want a relationship  that's going to last. Boyfriend: Who says it won't last?...we don't go home  until tomorrow afternoon. (b) (In the dining room) Joan Sims: I wouldn't  mind a roll. Sid James: Great, lets go upstairs. Joan Sims: I mean a  sausage roll... However, despite spiraling disasters, a Spanish love potion  ensures that the holiday isn't without its sparkle....and the movie  certainly isn't without one either.",961804800,2,1165,5.149732620320855

7884730,5,6305117403,Turner classic's started running Carry On movies on saturday mornings. Ok they are a little dated and you have to get through to the cockney english way of talking but I have no problem with their talking It's English  people not a fgn. Language. And then all of a sudden Turner stopped showing them and I figure well they started showing a little Nudity in them and I guess Turner Classic's just decided to not show anymore so I got cheated I wanted more. Amazon.com got a whole mess of them with great prices and guess what I am watching on Saturday mornings.,1469923200,,561,4.446601941747573

7884733,4,6305117403,"Deffinitely a good edition of the series. Plenty of randy behavior,almost seeming to include ""Stupid"",that is Stuart Farquahr,the tour guide,first name ""Stupid"" by Pepe the proprietor in the hotel from He--.Sad to be the last Carry On for Charlie,aparently script ridiculing his real life drinking problem.",1418256000,,306,5.673913043478261
7884734,4,6305117403,"Tongue in cheek movie about a bus load of holiday makers going to a hotel that isn't completely built in Europe.  Everything falls apart.  Filled with double entendre, this cast is just having a good time.  Laughed many times.",1373241600,,226,4.743589743589744
7884735,4,6305117403,Great fun and lots of laughs if you like British humour in it's almost raw form.  Raw for the era these films were made.  Lots of inuendo and base humour but not offensive.,1254614400,,172,4.181818181818182
7884736,4,6305117403,"This is about 25% down from the top of the carry on movies spread of hilarity.  It is still worth while watching.

The plot involves different groups of people who end up at the same foreign holiday hotel.

The technical quality is pretty good.  It fills a 9:16 screen with no vertical jitter as in past wham productions.  There is an audio commentary and one episode of the short carry on television programs.

I hope that wham will continue bringing these out and then loop around and do the same high quality productions of the movies they botched earlier on.",1207180800,,562,4.57
7884737,4,6305117403,"Carry On Abroad (1972) had one of the biggest cast's put together for this late entry to the series. All of the familiar favourites were in the cast which obviously were Sid James, Joan Sims, Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey, Peter Butterworth, Barbara Windsor, Hattie Jaques, Kenneth Connor, Bernard Bresslaw.
The gang all head for the Island of Ellsbells on the mediteranean as part of a holiday package deal. Only problem is that when they arrive at their hotel they are astounded to discover that the building is only half complete and there are a minimum of just three staff members (Peter Butterworth, Hattie Jaques and Ray Brooks).
All possible digs at the expense of package holiday deals are plumbed in this typical British comedy which, although extremley predictable to say the least, does make fun, entertaining viewing and in that fact I do rate it four stars out of five as it stands as one of the funniest later Carry on's. Peter Butterworth and Hattie Jaques steal the film as they made a priceless, almost laurel and Hardy duo here although many of the other teams members have their moments too which include Joan sims (the umbrella sequence at the end is a classic), Sid James who basically plays his usual rogue-like self, Kenneth Williams, who minces around as the incompetent holiday rep and June Whitfield playing Kenneth Connor's frigid wife. Charles Hawtrey by this stge had gone on a downward spiral as he battled on with his ever increasing drink problems andrather sadly, director, Gerald Thomas highlighted this fact by having Hawtrey appear drunk half way through the film as if to try and shock Hawtrey into what his life was becoming like. It didn't work and Hawtrey was never invited to appear in a Carry On film again. There had also been on-going problems with Hawtrey anyway as he continually caused problems for director Gerald Thomas and Producer Peter Rodgers as he firmly believed his name should be elevated above the title. They would never allow such a privelage saying that nobody is the sole star of the show and that the title, Carry On... would always take precedence. It was a sad end of an era and many claim this was the last true Carry On although Girls (1973), Dick (1974) and Behind (1975) would be of good value.
As for Carry On Abroad, well it serves as a reminder of what true carry On films are about - all fun and games! The film particularly scores well at it's hilarious climax where a torrential storm occurs, leading to the hotel slowly collapsing around their ears, only the gang are all too drunk and feeling far too amorous to even notice or care. Peter Butterworth manically runs round the hotel desperatley trying to get everybody too vacate the building and his efforts are ignored. This hilarious sequence is almost a direct re-working of the famous dinner party scene in Up The Kyber (1968), although there are slight variations. Needless to say the film manages to stay consistently funny throughout the entire film. Carry on Abroad remains a classic comic gem. Recommended.",995760000,4,3046,4.814885496183206
