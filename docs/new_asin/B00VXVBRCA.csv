7113714,5,B00VXVBRCA,"I always wondered why there wasn't a documentary on Doc Holliday. To me, he has always been the most interesting figure to come out of the ""Wild West"". This documentary far exceeded my expectations. It covers the full extent of Doc's life. It starts with his family history (Scots-Irish), his relation to the author Margaret Mitchell who wrote ""Gone With The Wind"", moves on to his childhood in Griffin and Valdosta, Georgia and then to his life in the west. It also tackles the controversy around what led him to go west and his involvement in several shootings and events that happened during that time. The documentary also has a fantastic soundtrack and score that really helps to tell the story. I'm very glad I added this to my collection of documentaries and will be watching it for years to come. If you like documentaries on the Wild West or on interesting characters from history, this one is for you.",1465257600,11,911,4.7
7113715,5,B00VXVBRCA,"Lots of new info on Doc Holliday and his Family from Doc's early days , tombstone and his final days ..Nice Documentary , if you're into the real Doc  Holliday  , this one is just for you !",1464912000,11,189,3.9473684210526314
7113716,4,B00VXVBRCA,"Though some of the editing is amateurish and the beginning is crowded, nevertheless this is a well-tell story. The historians interviewed are charming and emanate the essence of true historians in love with history. The images are also good and unique. The story end with the OK Corral. Doc is put into the light, somewhat less brilliant than the movies tell us. 4 Shining Stars!",1528848000,2,379,4.846153846153846

7113723,4,B00VXVBRCA,Good documentary on Doc. Holiday. It kept me intrigued to see what Doc would get into next. Worth a watch.,1527811200,,106,4.35
7113724,2,B00VXVBRCA,"I'd give it more stars for content, but the narrator sounds like he's trying to imitate Michael Murphy or Peter Coyote while drunk.  It's most distracting, and his tempo makes the documentary more dull than it should be.  It's also evident that his narration was spliced up pretty significantly, as you hear differences in volume even sentence to sentence, and some of the words get jumbled in the splicing.  Finally, far too often, pretty pictures of sahuaro-laden desert are playing when the narrator is describing Pueblo, Colorado or other areas outside Arizona and Mexico, where the sahuaro actually grow.",1527638400,,609,5.1313131313131315

7113726,5,B00VXVBRCA,"I had this on for noise while I was working on some paperwork and I found that I kept stopping to watch this.
We have watched a lot of 'wild west' shows during the time my son was interested in the wild west. So I thought this might be of interest to me. I learned a lot - This covers his early life, and as he grew up. It also covers what happened in Tombstone. The interviews were interesting and informative. I really enjoyed this documentary.",1527638400,,446,4.1976744186046515
7113727,5,B00VXVBRCA,"This was really interesting! I had heard of females passing as male soldiers during the  civil war, but this documentary really fleshed that story out.",1527465600,,151,5.04
7113728,5,B00VXVBRCA,My husband and I love this type of history and this definitely gave us a way better understanding and knowing of Doc himself,1527033600,,124,4.434782608695652

7113730,5,B00VXVBRCA,Well Done,1525219200,,9,4.0
7113731,5,B00VXVBRCA,"Very informative.  Goes into his early life, his family history, and follows him though the dozen or so places he lived.  Legend and truth are not always the same.  I appreciated this video for not taking any position about him as being good or bad, hero or outlaw, but simply a complex and flawed man who lived an extraordinary life.  They pointed out the contradictions in some of the stories about him, and that a lot of claims about what he did and did not do were not known for certain, and probably cant be known for certain.  It also gives us a picture of the old West as a very rough and rowdy place where the line between the good guys and the bad guys was often blurred. Yes, it was a bit long and quite detailed, but I found it well worth the investment of time.  I wondered about the title until the very end, and finally the light bulb went on.  Not only is the search for his true nature and character a bit frustrating due to uncertainty in the accounts of his life, there even seems to be some doubt about where his bones lie buried!",1524614400,4,1049,4.215
7113732,5,B00VXVBRCA,Just a fabulous documentary,1524268800,,27,6.0
7113733,1,B00VXVBRCA,"I fought the good fight but this documentary was so painfully dull that I had to give up in order to keep my sanity. The narrator sounds like he's bored stiff. Basically long still shots of landscape or old photos (used again and again) interspersed with interviews with dull ""experts.""",1524182400,2,286,4.74

7113736,5,B00VXVBRCA,"Excellent Video about one of Georgia's Favorite Sons who became an American Legend in his short 36 years on this earth. I own Dr. Roberts' book and found it a most informative and enjoyable read. I highly recommend the book as well as this video to any and all ""Old West History Buffs"" along with those who are simply curious about the Legend that was Doc Holliday .
I've been enamored of the Earps & Holliday for over 50 years and either own, or have read, everything I could lay my hands on about these legendary figures and their contemporaries during their time on earth. Every time something ""new"" comes out, I have to read the book or see the film or video. Even though the characters, especially Doc and Wyatt are as familiar to me as relatives would be, I never miss a chance to discover something I didn't know about these legendary Gentlemen.
If I find the book/film/video to be just a rehash of often told stories, I'm not disappointed and patiently wait for the next offering to be published. After all, the rehashed versions, if historically accurate, are like visits with old friends for me, just as long as it's not a ""Hit Piece"" containing blatant falsehoods meant to defame. The ""Real"" characters had enough ""Bad"" about them to make it unnecessary to make up stuff just to further sully their character and actions during times that we can only imagine living through.
Doc was, as an old song said, ""A walking contradiction. Partly truth and partly fiction."", and had Doc and Wyatt Earp, and all the other characters not existed, we likely would have had to invent them
Where Doc's bones are buried is of no matter.
He rests peacefully in the hearts of a great many Americans like myself.",1519776000,10,1705,4.6118421052631575
7113737,2,B00VXVBRCA,Very disappointed as there was no information that I did not already know.,1506816000,,74,4.769230769230769

7113744,5,B00VXVBRCA,I have quite a few DVD'S on Doc Holliday and this one is quite different. I like the information that is given. Easy to understand and not confusing information.

8711654,3,B00VXVBRCA,"I guess it's okay, but the narrator's childish enunciations make it kind of hard to understand, or maybe he thinks he's too cool to fully pronounce his words, either way he was a poor choice of narrator.",1531353600,,203,4.513513513513513
8711655,4,B00VXVBRCA,"Interesting piece about Doc Holliday. He was an interesting character and this documentary shows that, tracing from his youth in Ga to his death in Colorado. Worth the watch if you are interested in heroes of the old west.",1530748800,,222,4.717948717948718
8711656,4,B00VXVBRCA,"I like how it starts fast without the lengthy boring, ultimately redundant preambles that some documentaries have, e.g., Dinesh's ""America"" which tells you what you already know for the first 15 minutes with tedious cliches and sentimentality and nothing new brought to the table. This doc on Doc has some key details that your'd never find in the movie ""Tombstone"" about Doc's early years and dentistry. But it has some annoying flaws that should have been easy to avoid but were not avoided: they picked a poor narrator whose speaking voice is very average. He's no Peter Thomas (from ""Forensic Files"" the song ""19"" and the Tang TV commercial from the '60s). The best currently living choice would have been Jodie Foster, who has a great speaking voice for voice-over work, as she showed clearly in ""The Brave One.""  She could be the female Peter Thomas if she wants. The writing was poorly conceived at times and not proofread with common sense, e.g., when Doc died, they show his tombstone and talk of the funeral and never mention how old he was when he died. You might say they were economizing with words, but they were not. They gave the time he was buried, 4pm, which is trivial compared to his young age of 36. Any author who stresses, by mentioning, the trivial at the expense of omitting something far more important shows a lack of good judgment, which was maddening at times and might lead you to exclaim, ""What kind of braindead fools wrote this! - even a ninth grader would mention his age instead of the exact time he was buried, especially when 4pm is so commonplace.""",1530230400,,1586,4.684587813620071
8711657,3,B00VXVBRCA,"They kept showing pictures of saguaro cacti which are native to the Sonora desert in southern Arizona, while the narrator was talking about places hundreds of miles from there. This tended to invalidate the narrative.",1529884800,,217,5.228571428571429
8711658,4,B00VXVBRCA,It seems to be a depiction of verifiable historical information and leaves aside the character created by Hollywood. I thought it was very informative and worth a watch for someone wanting to know more about Doc.,1529107200,,212,4.916666666666667
8711659,4,B00VXVBRCA,"Quite informative regarding Doc Holiday's travels and experiences. Most are intrigued by the OK Coral group and for me, sadly to say, the more I learn about all of them the more I dislike then as people. The historians interviewed were knowledged and interesting. The missing star is for the weird music and occasional cuts that didn't make sense visually. However. If you want to learn about this man, this send to be an impartial great start.",1529020800,,444,4.779220779220779
