8691862,5,B00QLPEM5M,"The first version I saw was a Hindi dubbed version on line.  Since the original was shot in English, the dubbing was predictably horrible.  But I was really pleased with the English version, including the sing-song Indian accent of the heroine Angie (played by Deepika Padukone).  Naseeruddin Shah is excellent as usual in his quirky role of Ferdie.  The plot line winds through the picturesque scenery of coastal and inland Goa, in an old American Dodge no less.  There are enough twists to keep the plot from getting too slow, and the remaining characters keep the story rolling.  All in all, an unexpected, off-beat movie if you are in the mood for a change.  One irony I noticed was that most of the main characters get to speak at least one line in the native Konkani language, while the heroine, a native Konkani speaker, gets none.  Interesting.",1455235200,,852,4.7482993197278915

8691864,5,B00QLPEM5M,Enjoyed this movie! Lots of humor and originality.  This movie came all the way from India packaged and in tact.  Very pleased.  Only took roughly 2 weeks to get here. No complaints. I'd purchase from this seller again with no problem.,1429142400,,235,4.682926829268292
