5186407,5,B008VWJW58,"I was sooooo excited to see the original firm videos out on DVD!!  I have all the classics...volumes 1-6 and love them all.  I also got 5 day abs plus Tough tape 2 as well and rotate them 5 days a week.  I never seem to get bored with them and see such great muscle tone all over!  I always look forward to working out with them.  I have done P90x, newer firm dvds, 10 minute workout....you name it and i always come back to the Firm Classics....love Susan Harris in this and on volume 2, i believe, and love Kai's energy!  About 3 classics are a bit shorter around 45 min....good for when i don't have a lot of time....but i always make some time for my workouts.  I use 5 lb., 8 lb., 10 lb., and one 15 lb., weights from Target and ankle weights,  exercise mat and bought a small step stool and a taller step stool at target for the steps.  Love the sets, music, cueing and routines...feel so invigorated after a workout...simply the best!  Better than any class!  But i do need to turn on my fan full blast and have it blow on me...",1379030400,20,1035,4.125
5186408,5,B008VWJW58,"This is a great Firm tape from their 'classic' period.  They have a bench you can employ for some step moves if you choose to; I prefer not to as it means dividing my eyes between the TV screen and the bench to make sure no stumbles.  But a bench is not necessary, as this is a very good workout -- you just want some free weights of your choosing.  Many of the great, tough Firm tapes are 60 minutes, and this 45 minute one flies by in comparison.  There's still an aerobic workout and a reasonable stretch period, although I am starting to incorporate more of my own stretching (pilates) to augment the relatively short stretches in this series of workouts.  One standout of this particular DVD is the arm sequence -- it's tougher than some of the longer ones I do and it also works the back.  So overall, if you enjoy classic Firm DVDs, this is a good complement to the collection.",1360713600,11,884,4.327272727272727

5186412,5,B008VWJW58,One of my all time favorite workouts!!  I never get tired of this workout! Have use this for years. Since it first came out on VHS!,1460937600,4,131,4.038461538461538
5186413,5,B008VWJW58,Had this tspe on vh1 and it was always one of my favorite firm workouts. Missed doing it had to get the DVD.,1456704000,,108,3.739130434782609
5186414,5,B008VWJW58,"Sometimes it is nice to visit with old friends... I used the VHS version of the Firm series for years and found it very easy to stay engaged by cycling through the 4 different versions... there are probably more slick/sexy DVDs available today, but as something that helps me stay in shape without having to trudge to the gym, this can't be beat!  However, I do recommend having the other 3 ""classic"" DVDs as well to keep things interesting.",1454371200,5,441,4.582278481012659
5186415,5,B008VWJW58,I was super excited that they finally brought these out on dvd since my old tapes were worn and out of commission.  I love these original Firm workouts and by far this is my favorite.,1453334400,,183,4.228571428571429
5186416,5,B008VWJW58,Had this in VHS & thought it was time for an upgrade. Thanks!,1451174400,,61,3.769230769230769
5186417,5,B008VWJW58,"I love the workout however this DVD seams to be of poor quality.  The picture of the DVD is a little different than the one I ordered, it's the same workout but the sound and quality are not as good as the video's I have.  I worked out with the firm videos since 1985 I think.  I have worn out two of my favorite videos.  I also believe the price is a little high since these are from the mid 80's.",1446508800,5,398,3.876543209876543
5186418,5,B008VWJW58,"I purchased all of The Firm workout videos 25 years ago when they were on VHS.  Now, I'm in my mid 50's and realized that all of the bike riding and walking that I do don't address my need for strength and balance training.  This workout is great because it has the aerobic fitness component along with the weight training and is very easy to follow.  I tried working out to one of the newer The Firm Express Workout and couldn't keep up with the fast moves.  I realize that all of the workout clothing and hairstyles on this DVD are very dated, but the music is sort of generic and not obnoxious. Overall, it is a great work out that is very easy to follow.",1439251200,3,658,4.198412698412699
5186419,5,B008VWJW58,"This is one of the three The Firm work outs that have been my ""go to"" work outs.  So glad to be able to have it in DVD format.",1437782400,2,126,3.3448275862068964
5186420,4,B008VWJW58,good dvd,1434844800,,8,3.5
5186421,5,B008VWJW58,This is one of the classics--a total body aerobic weight training routine.. It's 40 minutes and it will elevate your heart and challenge you major muscles groups. The two instructors alternate and the cuing is good. Equipment needs are low step and a variety of aerobic weights. I've used a Rubbermaid step for years and it's fine. I had this on VHS and wore it out. Glad to have found it on DVD.,1433635200,4,396,4.438356164383562
5186422,5,B008VWJW58,"Love this oldie but goodie, very effective work out!",1433548800,2,52,4.888888888888889
5186423,2,B008VWJW58,"I bought this based on all the great reviews and the fact that I loved Volume 1 which also starred Susan Harris. I was honestly disappointed for several reasons. First of all ,quickly lifting weights while going on and off the step just felt awkward. I kept looking down aty step which made it hard to follow what they were doing. It also seemed that they lifted the weights quickly,which made me feel that my form suffered. I also didn't feel challenged enough. I am an intermediate to an advanced excerciser and own many 30-40 minute workouts that make me feel spent,but after this I still felt that I needed to work out more. I also ordered Volumes 2,3,5&6 the same time as this,so I hope they challenge me more",1429747200,3,714,4.5
5186424,4,B008VWJW58,Great exercise dvd also used it for years in VHS form. However the dvd has a few pauses in it. Probably faulty dvd because my other DVDs are fine.  The Firm is in several parts so you can do all of it or parts of it as you wish.  Makes you sweat!,1414108800,2,246,3.7115384615384617
5186425,5,B008VWJW58,"I have some of the original ""tapes"" and had used them 20 years ago, when I was 40. I felt like they were among the best exercise routines I had ever used, so I sought out others of the same vintage, but on DVD. I bought 4 and am very happy with all of them. Yes, the music and outfits are dated, but I feel much better; stronger and more flexible. At 62, I have not yet achieved the heavier weights used in many routines, but I am getting there!",1412294400,7,445,3.9555555555555557
5186426,5,B008VWJW58,"I have not purchased the DVDs, but I plan to. I have been doing the Firm classics, Volume 1 & 4 especially, since I was 3 or 4, and let me tell you these will whip you into shape in no time at all. I still have both and VHS and as soon as the tapes give out or my VCR takes a crap I will be investing! If you want to lose weight and get in shape or stay in shape, this will do it. These videos were way ahead of their time. Just prepare yourself for the sight that is brightly colored spandex.",1403827200,8,493,3.704761904761905
5186427,5,B008VWJW58,I am the owner of several Firm videos and this one has always been one of my favorites. I was thrilled to be able to find it on  DVD as I only had it on a VHS cassette! It is the perfect workout if you're short on time. Susan and Kai keep it fun and fast paced so you're done before you know it.,1393977600,7,295,3.609375

8531289,5,B008VWJW58,"I am so glad I found this DVD and the other original Firm exercise videos. They really do work and I like the routines that they offer. You can make it easy or hard, depending on the weights you use.  I like to push myself a little and it is easy with these exercises. I highly recommend all the original Firm videos. (not the newer ones). The original ones say Guaranteed visible results in 10 workouts on the front. I had these on VHS tapes and was so sad that I couldn't find them on DVD.  Thank you gaiiam!  I also like Jillian Michaels exercise videos.",1515283200,3,557,4.235849056603773

8531293,5,B008VWJW58,"This is one of the best. Once you learn these basic moves, you can put them together yourself in many combinations. Essentially you are doing cardio for a few minutes, then weights, then back to cardio and the time really flies. Most of the Firm workouts follow this format. You can get in shape at home, without having to go to a gym. Lifting weights does make an enormous difference. Just losing weight will not get you the body you had hoped for!",1496016000,2,449,4.421686746987952

8531295,5,B008VWJW58,I had the VHS tape that eventually wore out.  I bought it on DVD because it is sooooo effective and unlike almost every other work-out video is only 35 minutes.  Takes awhile to learn the routine.  I've modified and substituted some of the moves to keep the whole program low impact.,1490918400,,283,4.509803921568627

8531297,2,B008VWJW58,"I have owned two VHS tapes of The Firm Volume Four video workout and thought this DVD would be the same quality as I've had in the past. This, however, is a poor copy by a secondary seller. Anyone purchasing this the first time is missing the important ""20 Questions about Fitness"" bonus video that was originally located at the end of the tape. Also, the picture quality is a poor facsimile. I will use it because I do want the fantastic Firm workout and can no longer use my VHS tape, but the price is high for the quality of the video and missing educational piece at then end that will help a new user avoid injury.",1486252800,6,619,4.254237288135593
8531298,5,B008VWJW58,I was so happy to find this available on DVD after 20+ years of using the FIRM! The oldest ones in the series really are the best,1485043200,,129,3.814814814814815
