8418842,4,B004958K8Q,Enjoyed this journey for biking.  The scenery was breathtaking and there were also a lot of farms and other normal things to see as if you were actually on a trip.,1401753600,,163,4.258064516129032
8418843,3,B004958K8Q,"I wish I had paid more attention to what the music was in these tapes.  This tape has different styles of music, some nice but some very boring.  I mute the sound and play my own music while I have the scenery on.  It works, but I was looking forward to better music.  The scenery is pretty, just as if someone was biking along the road with a camera on their shoulder.  I regret buying these, and wish I had just pulled out my old Tim Janis videos as his music is so gorgeous and goes so well with the scenes in his videos/DVD's.  I guess I have learned from this that I really do not need a visual of actually riding a bike if there is beautiful scenery and music to enjoy.  On the other hand, this product is not awful and might be very enjoyable for people.  I will certainly keep these and use from time to time, or more likely, pass them along to someone who wishes they had pretty scenery to see on their indoor cycle or treadmill.",1362787200,,938,4.115384615384615
8418844,5,B004958K8Q,"I especially enjoyed the Blue Ridge Parkway & Shenandoah Bike-O-Vision adventures!  The landscapes are so varied and diverse.  Plus, they give descriptions of the many sites, as well as a detailed description of the journey at the end.  Great for exercise and learning!",1343606400,,269,5.209302325581396
8418845,3,B004958K8Q,"We recently purchased the Blue Ridge Parkway and Shenandoah Widescreen DVD and are not happy with it.  We have purchased the Washington and Oregon State DVD's and they have details, letting you know what direction you are headed in and what you are looking at.  They have at least six to eight selections for scenes that are on the DVD.

The package should have included a printed hardcopy of descriptive details along with the DVD.",1295395200,,432,4.733333333333333
