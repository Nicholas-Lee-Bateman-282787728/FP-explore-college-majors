8052428,1,B0007VY50S,A good movie but not worth paying 10 Cents for as it's a fourth or fifth generation copy from a VHS source.  A disgrace that it's on Amazon.  It's a shame the real owner's have not released this movie since the 1970's but hopefully they will soon. Not Reccomended.,1118102400,12,264,4.36734693877551
