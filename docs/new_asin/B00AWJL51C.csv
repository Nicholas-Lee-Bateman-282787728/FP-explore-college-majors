8558440,5,B00AWJL51C,"For those that want the four and a half hour version of this tragic epic, there is a Region 1, 3 disc set (Regular DVD) available from WellGo. Unfortunately, Amazon doesnt seem to carry the Region 1 Version at this time, except for the pricey Blu-Ray Version. I got my copy on the Bay for $16. There is a lot more character development in the Full Version, and more singing, which I probably could have done without. In any event, it is a master work, about a seldom heard period of Taiwan History. Highly Recommended!",1411948800,4,518,4.463157894736842
