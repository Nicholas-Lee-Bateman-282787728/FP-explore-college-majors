8103011,2,6303159869,"I looked for this movie because it was one of Noah Hathaway's few returns to the screen since adulthood.  With this project he did the best he could considering the material.  It's basically just an hour and a half of ""Kids, don't take drugs, drugs will kill you.""  Of course, Noah and his friend/mentor spend much of the movie smoking cigarettes but, apparently, that's OK.  Unless you're a really hard-core fan of either Noah Hathaway or Larry Gatlin (the country singer makes a foray into acting) OR if you're not aware that drugs can be bad for you, avoid this movie.",1363132800,,571,4.623762376237623
