1783064,5,B00006JY50,"This picture finds a very young Bergman (still in his 34) dealing with a very agile and fascinating psychological portrait of a family who is passing through a very serious affective and emotional crisis. With a great doses of humor, Bergman draws an admirable semblance of the youth (through Monika `s character) as well as the identity crisis of  a married woman who must decide between the well known marriage `s traditions instead of follow her primary instincts with a renowned sculptor.

Far beyond of the pleasant ending,  mature and disturbing reflection nestle in this peculiar film, who must be watched with the considerations of those times.

Watch it and maybe you and I agree respect the fact this has been possibly the main inspiration `s source to Woody Allen `s films such as Interiors, Hannah and her sisters, Stardust memories and Husband and wives.",1142467200,2,867,4.958620689655173

It's an OK edition, worth obtaining especially for Bergman fans. The film is also available on NTSC VHS as ""Monika."" Renaming the title of this film yet another time as ""Monika, the Story of a Bad Girl"" is just ridiculous.

Aside from unaccredited roles in past Ingmar Bergman films, Harriet Andersson is introduced in a leading role alongside Lars Ekborg (both in their twenties playing 17 year old Monika and 19 year old Harry.) As often in Bergman's films the story has a deeper meaning than its basic plot, and has a stable shifting of multiple emotion.

1783067,4,B00006JY50,"There are interesting Special Features that accompany the main feature, especially the interview with Harriet Andersson, at age 80, and still sharp and with very clear memories of this, one of her earliest movies.  She was 20 when it was shot in 1952, and she gives a very convincing performance of a manipulative and perhaps self-deluded 18-year-old.  Playing the 19-year-old Harry is Lars Ekborg, and he too is fine as a more naive and idealistic, and finally more realistic, character than Monika.  The story is very simple -- two teenagers take off from their jobs and families and spend the summer on a Swedish archipelago that seems to them almost a kind of Eden, and Bergman's camera lets us share that impression, without irony, for as long as the idyll lasts.  But as the seasons change, the look of the setting becomes darker, and the moods of the characters darken too.  Monika becomes pregnant, and they are running out of food, and so they are forced to go back and forced into a marriage that, before the idyll, had seemed to be exactly what they wanted.  But now they have a baby, and Harry has a low-paying job, but is working to educate himself to get a better one.  Monika, however, is unhappy, and still hankers after a more carefree and pleasant life . . .  Can the marriage be saved?

Early in the movie, in the scenes of the coastal town where Harry and Monika live, we see enough to understand their longing for escape -- the dull work, the careworn faces, the routine of politeness, the unsatisfactory (in different ways) family situations.  Monika's dad seems to be a drunk, and her mother, with three children besides Monika, seems totally unworried and totally disorganized.  We do notice too that Monika makes no effort to work to improve the family's life -- she seems lazy and self-absorbed.  Harry's mother has been dead for a decade, and his father is in poor health and dependent on Harry's aunt to help manage the house.  This domestic situation lacks the tension of Monika's, but it doesn't seem to offer much.  Harry is perhaps depressed -- he is consistently late for his job and romantic movies seem to offer a temporary escape.  So we can sympathize with the predicaments, but character is fate, and Monika happy isn't an essentially different person from the old Monika, as Harry learns to his disappointment.  I was reminded a bit of ""Elvira Madigan,"" except that ""Summer with Monika"" is a less emotionally extravagant movie and the embedding of the characters and their problems in a specific social and cultural situation is much more plausible.  Bergman takes his time so that we can savor both the highs and the lows of the escape, and his attention to the details of the boat trip out and the return trip is very telling, with the camera doing as much as the dialogue to render the shift in mood. The reprising of the images of the bridges as the boat returns is a brilliant visual correlative for the sense of something closing in and narrowing the horizon, and the black-and-white photography seems just right for the tone.  All in all, it's not ""The Seventh Seal,"" but it's stark and well worth seeing.

Note:  An additional feature with the movie is a commentary on the way the movie was re-edited, re-titled, dubbed, and marketed as a sex exploitation film in the US.  Visually, it seems pretty chaste by today's standards, but this was the mid-1950's, and Harriet Andersson's naked shoulder blades got the job done and, I guess, kept things on the right side of the censors.",1437523200,,3526,4.710097719869707
1783068,3,B00006JY50,"In Ingmar Bergman's 1953 film SOMMAREN MED MONIKA (The Summer with Monika), young, idealistic Harry (Lars Ekborg) meets the freespirited Monika (Harriet Andersson). Fed up with their dull stockroom jobs as midsummer approaches, they quit and and escape together to one of the myriad islands in the Stockholm archipelago. But while Harry is keen to get back to civilization and further his education in order to support the child they will soon have, Harriet thinks little of the future, pursuing her own whims of the moment. Harry is definitely the protagonist here, and receives the sympathy of the viewer as this bad girl tears his life apart.

Upon its release, this film was a major contribution to Sweden's mid-century reputation as a sexually liberated place. However, that's all very much in the past. There is only one scene of (rear) nudity, and for the most part what 1950s audiences found scandalous is just some snogging that wouldn't raise eyebrows today. Still, Andersson does know how to flaunt her sex appeal, her full lips and proportioned figure, to the camera.

In my opinion, this is not one of the greatest films of the auteur scene. Ingmar Bergman would go on to create a series of masterpieces that totally shook my world, but SOMMAREN MED MONIKA is a somewhat ordinary study of working class life and a morality tale much like British audiences would start getting with their kitchen sink dramas (e.g. BILLY LIAR) in the following years. There is also a totally contrived -- and rather inexplicable -- fight scene that Bergman needlessly uses to make Harry look chivalrous. Still, it is interesting to see a Sweden of severe class divisions that is now almost gone, with alcoholism-stricken families in dire poverty living alongside more fortunate Stockholm residents who keep servants. The first third of the film is almost like listening to an Allan Pettersson symphony.

All in all, the film is entertaining and teaches us something about an earlier time and place, but don't think this is one of the more serious films that established Ingmar Bergman as one of the most daring and insightful filmmakers of the 20th century.

Criterion's DVD and Bluray releases come with a few extras, starting naturally from the film's trailer. There's a 25-minute interview of Andersson by film critic and Bergman expert Peter Cowie. ""Images from the Playground"" is a 30-minute sequence of archival footage from film sets -- for more Bergman films than just SOMMAREN MED MONIKA -- and over it is audio of interviews with Bergman, Harriet Andersson and Bibi Andersson.",1429660800,3,2580,5.006993006993007

I respectfully disagree with Turfseer: She's exactly what she appears to be--selfish, immature, and dull-witted, and you know that that's where the movie is going to go within about five minutes.

She picks up with an incredibly naive (I remain skeptical that nineteen-year-old boys, even in 1952, were ever this clueless) young man who will do anything her crass little heart desires.

Light, in the shapes that spills from the  screen I am dazed with the black and white forms. The story is humanity as a slap in the romantic love story face. But don't let that turn you away because while the romance lasts it makes it all worth it. Can we truly find happiness in our true love? Even if we can't we can find happiness in this classic of classics. Don't loan this out. I made that mistake twice and never got them back. Art belongs to the world. This film is art so filling it is almost raw. The edges between the white and the black are like the edges between our first love and what comes of it.

1783076,5,B00006JY50,"Bergman is perhaps one of those artists that you either love or perhaps quite like; maybe some people hate his films.

'Summer with Monika' is I think one of his most accessible films, and in actual fact is a little like 'Summer Interlude' in it's story. The difference is that where the latter is a nostalgic journey into a bittersweet past, the former film is about a reckless, feckless summer fling in the present tense. Two basically working class kids decide to pack in their jobs and take a summer vacation on dad's boat going to explore the lonely coast of Sweden. It sounds idyllic, and while they are on holiday it is; kind of. The cinematography and scenes in this film are wonderful, and when the boat leaves the city and reaches the great outdoors, you can say that Sweden is a beautiful country.

Anyway, the summer spent with Monika is wonderful, even though they run out of money and there is a fist fight after some delinquent sets fire to the boat; who said Bergman was all cerebral?! Unfortunately, poor Monika gets knocked up, although she seems quite cool with it. When they finally return, from cloud 9, to stark reality again, the truth perhaps dawns on them both; they had better try and make a go of it. The poor kids tie the knot, but things just don't work out; Harry tries to get more education so he can get decent employment but Monika is bored looking after the baby and staying in all the time. They part, as Monika starts going with other men and out to nightclubs, and poor Harry is left carrying the baby. Not so bleak, but not so happy either.

Bergman was an artist and he tried to convey great truths (I think) through simple, and sometimes complex, human relationships of all kinds. That he largely succeeded is testimony to the fact that he remains a much cherished filmmaker to this day, and of course his films are no doubt watched and admired all over the world. Is it possible to really know what Bergman was trying to say in this film? Perhaps, and perhaps not. Is it a poem to lost youth and lost ideals; the myth of 'happy ever after' meeting the harsh reality of life, and how adults complicate matters by being sophisticated and worldly, whereas the two kids who go on that boat jaunt are innocent and carefree, even if Monika is a troubled soul. Perhaps 'Summer with Monika' is Bergmans paean to lost youth and the sad fact we all grow up, and perhaps far too quickly.",1370390400,,2417,4.488636363636363
1783087,5,B00006JY50,"Great print, I can understand in part the  Allen connects with Bergman's themes. Great love story. Woody adds humor that makes the missanhropic medicine go down in the most delightful way.",1360281600,,188,5.064516129032258
1783088,4,B00006JY50,"One of the things I love most about Blu-ray is that films from the 50s and earlier can be brought back to life. Summer with Monika is a Criterion release, so you know that it looks as good as it can. For a 60-year-old film, the results are most pleasing.

The story is about human relationships, and how our perspectives alter as we mature. Harry is 19 when he's approached by Monika in a cafe. She's very forward and asks him if he'll take her to the cinema. After he agrees, the two decide that they need to be together. The title suggests that the relationship might not last forever, but stop reading now if you want to avoid further spoilers.

Both have boring jobs, and Harry soon follows Monika's lead after she quits. She seeks refuge with him, claiming that her drunken father is abusive, and Harry does his best to provide for her. In order to have privacy, he takes her to his father's boat and they sleep there. This is the start of an adventure in the style of a road movie, but this one involves a boat. The two sail to secluded areas and live with a certain amount of freedom. The main problem is their lack of money, but they are not above stealing in order to survive. It's like an ancient cross between Something Wild, Pierrot le fou, and Grave of the Fireflies, but nobody's life is in danger.

Things follow their natural course, with Monika eventually revealing that she is pregnant. It's here that Harry realizes that his idyllic life will soon have to end, and that the couple will need to be more responsible if they are to raise a child, but Monika hates the thought of returning to her old life. When she accepts the inevitable, their lives change. Harry's life starts to feel like Henry Spencer's existence in Eraserhead, as he is forced to find time to study, work, support his family, and take care of his baby. Monika doesn't seem ready to be a mother at all and wants her life to go back to the way it was.

One interesting sequence shows the differing outlooks of teenagers and middle-aged people. The younger couple feel that they have to rebel and escape a traditional life in order to be happy, but one of the older characters embraces the feel of the city after being away for a few days.

Bergman uses the industrial smoke and natural mist to enhance the dreamlike quality of their romance, and reinforces it by having his two characters smoke cigarettes throughout the film. This is a fairly straightforward look at young romance, and shows how society viewed people who had children before they were married. If you want to see how Stockholm looked in the 50s, this is like an historical document.

Summer with Monika won't drastically alter your perspective on life, but it's a well-told romance with plenty of realism. Fans of the film, or Bergman, should definitely invest in the Criterion Blu-ray.",1358035200,3,2840,4.5588235294117645
1783089,4,B00006JY50,"Many do consider this the first major film of Bergman, but I feel that Sommerlek (Summer Interlude) would technically qualify as his first breakthrough.  Though in this film I saw shades of the French New Wave, little touches that reminded me of Truffaut and even early Goddard (at least with the cinematography and sparse dialogue at times).

And speaking of cinematography, this is one of the earlier collaborations with Gunnar Fischer, who would continue collaborating with Bergman on such marvelous eye candy as Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, and up to The Magician before being replaced with Sven Nyquist.  I actually preferred Fischer's cinematography over Nyquists.  While the later films (such as Persona) were arguably 'better' in an artistic sense, I really felt that Fischer had an amazing grasp of black and white with less emphasis on shades of gray (sorry about putting that in there - no reference to the book).  A lot of the scenery in this film, and other Fischer films is the dramatic use of deep black and light grays to create an almost surrealistic effect.  Done so marvelously in this film.

Criterion has really outdone themselves with this new release (the restoration that is).  I have the DVD from the library, so I cannot comment on the Blu-Ray, but the DVD is just pristine and clear.  The sound is retained with the original mono track.  Dust and particles have been cleaned, but the image was not run through a 'wash' filter.  The clarity is there.  Contrast is impeccable.

My one beef is that there are limited special features.  I'm not so driven to a frenzy by the lack of special features, just at nearly $30, I expect something a little more.  Remember when Criterion used to have gobs of special features? Three disc Seven Samurai set ring a bell?  Well the booklets are getting thinner, and the content in the booklets is rather short.  This is the main reason for the four star review as opposed to five.  Plus, this film is clearly a transitional film and cannot hold a candle to Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, or even Smiles of a Summer Night.  So four stars it is.

Oh, and the film is about a young dalliance that turns all too real.  It reminds one of Summer Interlude, yet it does beyond what happened in Summer Interlude (in that film we had an incident which prevented their being together in the long run).  In this we see the reality of the romance, and what happens after the fire goes out.  Harriet Andersson rules the screen in this early film of hers.

A MUST see for Bergman fans, though it is not among his best 5.  Perhaps squeaks into a top 10 list of his films.  But it's important to show where he was coming from (Summer Interlude) and where he was about to lead us.  Nearly $30 to purchase this film on DVD when Summer Interlude (released just a few months ago) is $15 and has about the same content and extras?  Not understanding the current pricing setup from Criterion.  If this film drops under $20, then it is worth purchasing.",1345593600,,2997,4.655238095238095

Rating: 4.5 out of 5.0

Right before the release of 'Sawdust and Tinsel', which marked the beginning of Ingmar Bergman's long string of profound films with metaphysical themes, he served up 'Summer with Monika', a film more in the tradition of the Italian neo-realists, about a young couple who spend a summer of abandon amongst the islands of the Swedish archipelago, north of Stockholm, before returning to the city and getting married.

The film's principals, Harry and Monika, are introduced when they meet at a bar. One is struck right away by Monika's liking for Harry--he really doesn't have to do anything and immediately scores a date with her at the local cinema. We soon discover that both young people are very needy. Monika comes from the more lower class background, residing in a tenement apartment with her mother and an alcoholic father, along with younger siblings who can't keep quiet. Harry lives in a bigger home but lost his mother when he was eight and hardly speaks with his father who suffers from health problems.

In the film's first act, Harry and Monika are at the point where they both want to run away as they both hate their jobs. Harry is a delivery person for a glass and porcelain factory and is constantly berated by his superiors as he's often late for work and shows little enthusiasm for the job. Monika works for a produce wholesaler and must endure the salacious comments and outright groping by crass co-workers and supervisors. It's understandable how Monika is so immediately attracted to the kindly Harry, as he doesn't treat her as a sex object like many of the men she knows from her side of the tracks.

Perhaps the only unsatisfying aspect of 'Summer with Monika', is the underdeveloped character of Lelle, one of Monika's neighbors who we can presume has either had a prior relationship with Monika or admired her from afar. Out of jealousy he socks Harry in the face out of the blue, after observing him escorting Monika home and saying goodbye. It's an awkward scene because we find out nothing about Lelle before, and wonder simply who this guy is.

The film's second act (where the principals commit themselves to an adventure outside their ordinary lives) occurs after Harry is fired from his job (and Monika quits hers); Harry ends up convincing Monika to take his father's motor boat up to the islands in the archipelago and 'live free' from the constraints of their drab lives back in the city. The cinematography, highlighting the natural wonders of this part of Sweden, is magnificent. The second act machinations include more revelations about Harry's upbringing as well as another awkward scene with Lelle fighting Harry after he attempts to torch their boat (has he been stalking the couple the whole time? Again, he's a character who always seems to be popping up out of the blue without a back story).

One of the great things about Bergman is that you can always count on him for his deeply nuanced female characters. 'Summer with Monika' is basically a brilliant character study about a very young woman who turns out to be quite different than what we're first led to believe. At first, Monika appears quite sympathetic, as she cradles Harry in her arms after he reveals how lonely he was as a child (due to the loss of his mother and distant father).

Even before Monika's sudden transformation, there are clues that she has quite a different temperament than Harry. When Harry is fired, he only brings himself to tip over one glass in the factory, instead of smashing many more glasses as he could have done. When Harry knocks Lelle down during the boating trip, Harry restrains Monika, who could have ended up killing him, by striking him with the oar.

Monika begins to sing a different tune when the intrepid couple find themselves subsisting on mushrooms for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Like a savage animal, she breaks into a well-to-do home on one of the islands and steals a pot roast. The husband calls the police but Monika breaks free and returns to the boat, where Harry chastises her for committing an illegal (and hence immoral) act. Monika has no scruples, and believes that the 'ends justify the means'.

The third act, perhaps the strongest of the film, chronicles the dissolution of Harry and Monika's relationship. They end up marrying due to Monika's pregnancy. She turns out to be the wife from hell as she doesn't want to care for her child and would like to resume the life she had when she was single. Meanwhile, Harry takes steps toward maturity by finding a job, with co-workers who treat him with respect.

Things go from bad to worse, when Harry discovers that she's been sleeping with Lelle and also spent the rent money on an expensive suit. When he asks her why she went to bed with Lelle, she cynically claims that she loves him. Harry then slaps Monika who ends up leaving him. Bergman's portrait of Monika is sympathetic but he doesn't excuse her behavior. In effect, she goes back to the very men she was trying to escape from in the first place. The famous close-up of Monika suggests that she's as empty on the inside as that vacant stare we see on the outside.

On the other hand, when we see Harry close-up in the last scene, we're first treated to a montage of the young father's memories of his summer with Monika. His expression changes from pride in his newborn, to a look of sadness, as he realizes that he has a tough road ahead as a single parent. The brilliance of Bergman is that he never sugarcoats reality. Monika's actions are vile but her difficult upbringing is no excuse for her rejecting her responsibilities as a mother. Indeed, Bergman is saying, there are people like Monika in this world! Deal with it!",1344988800,13,5773,4.727634194831014
1783091,5,B00006JY50,"There's an interesting phenomenon that sometimes occurs in movies when a director becomes so famous for a particular work,-in this case The Seventh Seal,- that there is a tendency to automatically devalue the work that came before it. I wonder if this is not the case with the rather tepid 3 star reviews on here. I found Summer with Monika to be a fascinating and surprising cornerstone to Bergman's oeuvre.

Always autobiographical in his work, Bergman here explores the type of youthful ennui and rebellion that very often precedes the true flowering of an artistic soul, which makes it a rather important addition in his pantheon. Tracing the evolution of first love from its conception to its ending, we are offered something of a genesis to Bergman's later genius for scouring out psychological minutiae, not to mention the deeper wells of pain and angst located within the human constitution.

Cinematographically sturdy from stalwart collaborator Gunnar Fischer, psychologically cogent in its expression of Swede restlessness, although it might thin out some of the Seventh Seal admirers, Summer with Monika is a must for anyone caught up in the Bergman Mystique.",1344902400,,1171,5.190476190476191
1783092,5,B00006JY50,"Thematically, My Summer with Monika is very simple. Its the story of a young shopgirl (Harriet Anderson) who begins dating a young worker and would-be student Harry. Monika is extremely comfortable in her body and extremely forward with men. She's a natural flirt and she's the one who makes the first move with the much more subdued Harry at a local cafe. What they share is discontent with their workaday existence. From the opening scenes we can see that Monika is spilling over with life (and raw sensuality and desire) and that she is someone who knows that she must go after what she wants, not wait for it, but what does she want? Like many young shopgirls, she knows she doesn't want to be a shopgirl, but she has no other plan, no other options, or opportunities. She can attract men easily, but she doesn't know what to to do with them once she's got them. Harry is slightly better looking and from a slightly better social class than her other boyfriends and he's also slightly more naive. Its never clear whether she really loves Harry or if Harry with his boat offers her an escape from a life she can no longer tolerate. Monika seems fairly transparent and yet there is ambiguity in her character that makes this film transcend the usual girl-traps-rich-boy-into-marrying-her-story (which this both is and isn't). What is clear about Monika is that with her feline sexuality she can persuade Harry to do whatever she wants him to do. That both intrigues her (and allows her to take ameasure of her own power) and bores her (Harry rarely initiates any of their adventures). The summer they spend running away from the world is both a study in youthful escapism and bonding and also an awakening to adult isolation and disappointment. At the beginning of the film, Monika moves like a cat who can find no prey to satisfy her. At the end of the film she knows it.

The New Wave directors love the moment, near the end, when  adjusts her hair and then looks directly into the camera. Its a fascinating look/a look that comes from somewhere deep inside: she seems to be daring us to look as squarley at her (and what she represents/has to tell us) as she is looking at us. Its up to the individual viewer to accept this invitiation or to reject it.

In the DVD extras we learn that the main selling point for this and other Swedish films (that contained brief nudity) was their open sensuality. And that sensuality is still striking but in the moment Monika stares directly at us she becomes something far more than an object of desire, she becomes a symbol of youthful disaffection.",1342828800,,2592,4.61822125813449

1783098,3,B00006JY50,"Big fan of the Ingmar Bergman body of work which contains some to the greatest films in cinematic history! Films which set the benchmark and inspired no doubt thousands of budding directors. This is one of his works that I just never got around to watching. I really don't know how it escaped me. It is famous in its own right for inspiring what any Baby Boomer will remember as the ""risqu foreign film"". Well having watched it I found very little to like. A disjointed, depressing story (nothing new to a Bergman film) but even more disheartening--a poorly developed character study. Lars, the boy, is the only sympathetic character in the film. Beyond the two main characters we don't get to know anyone else in this story to any depth at all. The summer on the island is but a very brief part of the story--and it didn't seem to be all that happy and carefree as touted to be. The film is described as ""sensual"" and one of Bergman's most important films! I simply can't agree. Compared to a film such a ""The Silence"" which is admittedly a difficult film to watch is nevertheless just packed to the brim with character development, tension, and sensuality. But in then I suppose you would just have to watch it yourself and form your own opinion.",1340236800,4,1248,4.551111111111111
1783099,4,B00006JY50,"The first half recalls Bergman's earlier 'Summer Interlude'. But the
second half goes further and explores the 'what if' of the summer
romance between teens; moving into parenthood, marriage, and
disillusionment.

The acting is excellent, and unlike 'Summer Interlude' these actors
look close to the nave age they're playing.

The film's point of view sometimes felt a bit one sided to me with 'bad
girl' Monika, from a crude, poor family, less willing to extend herself
than her upper-class boyfriend Harry. Of course, along with being
selfish she is also the more complex and fascinating character,
especially as played by the young Harriet Andersson.

Some critics make the argument - with merit - that the film doesn't
judge Monika,the audience does. Indeed, it could be argued that the
film is meant to make us question our own judgment of a poor girl who
is brought up with dreams of marriage as a glamorous escape, and not
just a humdrum existence. It's not for nothing the heroine is obsessed
with Hollywood love stories.

Andersson's performance may be the first of the many hyper-real and
extremely complex characters in Bergman's body of work, transcending
'type' and moral judgment.

The film was beloved by the French New wave filmmakers, who saw in it's
complex attitude (and very brief nudity) a throwing off of the shackles

1783101,5,B00006JY50,"The late 1940's through the early 1950's, imo, were the very best years for cinema. Before the demise of the big screen, the distilling influence of t.v., the necessity for big budgets -  the mandatory interference with the art by folks who really do not belong in the creative process - casting directors, tyrannical studio v.p.'s, credit-jumpers, tabloid paparazzi, the right wing politicizing of lew wasserman and the hollywood blacklisters - particularly in small countries like Sweeden and Japan - one could still create art on the screen in a simple, unvarnished, moving way.  Like Kurusawa's magnificent Ikiru filmed around the same time, Summer With Monika is simply one of Bergman's best, and upon many years of reflection, more memorable for me than Persona, Skammen, or other more highly touted, more complex Bergman masterpieces.
Though not without idiosyncracies and flaws, the film maybe Bergman's definitive investigation of a question that haunts many of his later undertakings - what is at the root of (god forbid me for saying it) the feminine mystique?  Bergman's answer: In the words of no less an expert on the eternal misery of women than Dr. Laura Schlessinger (sans her deplorable politics): ""... low or no self-esteem"".

The idyllic utterly illusory edenic summer romance played out in in the last vestiges of an innocence which cannot live in the workaday world, brilliantly, by the gorgeous Lars Ekborg (Harry) and Harriet Andersson (Monika - was there ever a more sensually provocative heroine filmed on screen - and note: entirely without makeup, hollywood diet/workout routine, or skin shop quick fix-it?) is as graphic a peek at Eve's primal first bite as we will ever have in post-modern consciousness.
What Arthur Miller (also around this time) termed 'the tragedy of the common man', of epic porportion and real, filmed on a shoestring budget, von de seele.",1330300800,6,1891,5.149837133550489
1783102,3,B00006JY50,"In 1950s Sweden, two young working class kids, still in their teens, the reckless and rebellious Monica and the handsome if quiet Harry, decide to elope from their families in his father's boat and have a torrid affair in an island in the Stockholm archipelago during the summer. When she becomes pregnant, the couple has to return to the city and face reality. Harry gets a stable job and strives to become a responsible parent, but Monica rejects the routine of married life, and eventually the responsibilities of motherhood, because, as she says, being young she prefers to have fun. This film was reputedly extremely daring at the time it was filmed (Monica appears in a few scenes partially nude at the beach) but it really seems almost quaint now. One problem is that films dealing with social issues tend to age quickly, much more so than other type of films. Since social mores change, a film portraying a conflict with the social norms of the era that seems daring at the time it is released looks more and more dated once the social norms are changed. The beginning, portraying Monica fighting with her coarse working class family in their crowded apartment and at their grocer's post, seems to belong to a socialist realism movie. Maybe director Ingmar Bergman was at that point too influenced by the Italian films of the time, but it doesn't look a Swedish milieu at all. Harry is portrayed as the more mature of the two, but at times he is also totally irresponsible, like when he decides to elope with Monica at the moment when his father is gravely ill at the hospital (and what happened to him is never said, apparently he died while the couple were at the island). It is said that Monica became an inspiration to many rebellious girls in the 1950s and 1960s, but I found her character unappealing all way through, not terribly physically attractive and also irresponsible, immature, callous, capricious. And there are some really inept scenes in the movie (yes, I know the scenes were directed by Bergman, but I still would called them ineptly filmed) like when he fights the other guy in the beach or when Monica steals a roasted meat to a middle class family. The movie has a great scene though, that seems to belong to a better and more recent movie, when Monica, after she becomes a mother and is dissatisfied with conjugal life with Harry, flirts in a bar with a new lover and suddenly breaks the fourth wall looking straight at the camera with a seducing look. So this is not a great movie in my view, though at least it gives some material for thought.",1294358400,7,2577,4.641137855579869

of the escape from work and slavery,the glinting summer sun reflected in the water,the sporting young lovers without a care in the world. Then with offspring, the need to earn more money with the re-emmersion back into reality and wage slavery, with no escape. Bergman showcases the remarkable Harriet Anderson,sensual tigress, who went on to make more films with him. She had none of the introspective,nervous intensity of his later heroines, but a sense of instinct and wild abandon. The story is simple and well told.

1783105,3,B00006JY50,"Having heard much about this film, I imagined a completely different finale (or rather the second, ""after-summer"" part). The first half of the movie is brilliant. The dreary city life, the escape, the idyllic existence on the island, Harriet Andersson - all are great. The return back to civilization - that's where he loses it. The every day reality of life is portrayed so hastily that it turns into a banality, overdramatic and totally theatrical at the end of the film. Yet it is a very good film, far from being a masterpiece but it deserves 3.5 stars.",1189728000,2,557,4.6938775510204085
1783106,4,B00006JY50,"What started as a story of idyllic summer of love and journey, shared between very young Harry and Monica, became an interesting study of relationship that had to survive the demands of real world after the journey was over.

I kept thinking while watching this film what would've happened to Romeo and Juliet (who were close by age to film's heroes Monica, 17 and Harry, 19) had they been given a chance to live happily ever after. Would they be able to love each other after the reality of marriage would fight with their eternal love, when the baby is crying all night long and there is no money to pay a rent, and young and tender Juliet has learned about power and pleasures of sex but her Romeo is always out working, trying to make enough money to support her and the child? Would Juliet get bored and angry with Romeo for leaving her home alone? Would she start looking for fun elsewhere? Would be Romeo left heartbroken and bitter or would the memories of that unforgettable summer with his Juliet - Monica still stay with him as the best time of his life?

Beautiful film with wonderful Harriet Andersson as a sultry teenager Monica, full of life, rebellious against her boring existence at home, ready for all pleasures of adult life but not ready for responsibilities of a wife and a mother. Will she learn? Will she remember the summer with Harry? Bergman, as usual, does not answer the questions. He never does.

7970809,5,B00006JY50,"This is the ultimate anti-romance movie. I feel it has a type of sarcasm within that is uniquely Bergman. Harriet Andersons character is wonderfully developed as the run of the mill inner city youth desperately trying to hang on to a model of youthful romance while at the same time already in the process of rapidly fading into low sector adult life.
This film is darkly comedic while at the same time being super dramatic because Bergman pulls the right strings in relation to problems every young male or female goes through. This film makes the ultimate case for romantic love being material. I have always felt the Beckett play Waiting for Godot had a similar theme inside a larger framework.
I remember being young and broke and desperately trying to keep a romance while always competing with older guys that had cars or more material items.
I really had a bittersweet compassion for both of these characters as i feel they represent all youth growing up with additional stress factors brought on by lower sector life.

7970814,4,B00006JY50,"In this rare, straight-forward film by Ingmar Bergman, two young lovers discover that freedom from responsibility only lasts so long.  Twenty-year old Harriet Andersson plays 17-year old Monika, who lives in a small apartment in Stockholm with her parents and several siblings, all much younger.  She cant get a minute's peace.  And when she goes to her job stocking vegetables, things don't get much better.  One day on her lunch break she meets Harry (Lars Ekborg), a young man who is a couple years older.  They quickly form a friendship that leads to romance.  Harrys job as a delivery boy for a cantankerous shop owner and a demanding supervisor makes his life difficult as well.  While his home life isn't as hectic as Monikas, he looks after his ailing father.

Finally the pair decide to stop sneaking around as their love affair becomes physical and just disappear for the summer.  Taking Harrys fathers boat they cruise to an archipelago and just hang out.  I suspect it is during the shooting of these scenes that Bergman fell in love with Andersson and its easy to see why.  Shes alluring and sexy, parading around in her undies (granted, the kind granny wore).  Things are idyllic for a while, but then the food runs out.  They have little money and a vandal, known to Monika, trashes their boat in a fit of jealousy.  Finally, Monika believes she is pregnant but seems unaware how her life might now change.  Fast forward to the baby having arrived.

Harry has entered engineering school and only has a part time job until he graduates.  Monika stays in bed most of the time bemoaning her loss of freedom and fun-loving life.  Even as Harrys aunt takes care of the baby most of the time, Monika seems uninterested in motherhood or getting a job.  Certainly Bergman is captivated by Anderssons Monika as the camera caresses her in extreme close-ups and, startling for the era, nudity.

While the film was highly controversial, even in Sweden, it is pretty tame by todays standards (probably a PG-13).  Scandalous as it was, it was co-opted in America by producer Kroger Babb who had a history of distributing titillating movies.  He cut the film down to about an hour and renamed it Monika, The Story of a Bad Girl.  An L. A. judge said the film appealed to potential sex murderers.  Ah, the good old days.  It is an excellent film with a powerful emotional core.  Recommended.",1457740800,3,2390,4.72639225181598
