525792,5,6302982693,"Realistic-adventure and slapstick-comedy normally do not mix, but here they do, because there is a good story, and the film is carefully balanced so the realism brings you right back to the story after limited comedy.

This film has a fitting hero, sword fights, a couple very good songs, a little romance, and surprisingly, some good comedy.

The Ritz brothers sometimes give that silly, cross-eyed, look, that Martin Short can do, that looks so silly, you just want to slap them for looking so silly This is a fun and lively film, yet with realism that makes you wonder, if it did not really happen that way. An excellent, charming, film.

Another great version of ""The Three Musketeers"" that you have never heard of is ""At Sword's Point- 1952"" with Alan Hale Jr., Cornell Wilde, and Maureen O'Hara.",1177372800,9,801,4.7898550724637685

525794,3,6302982693,"This is really a spoof of The Three Musketeers. The Ritz Brothers are not my cup of tea. This version only follows the first half of the novel. The Ritz Brothers played lackeys. Douglas Dumbrille,Russell Hicks and John King played the Athos,Porthos and Aramis. Don Ameche did a good job as D'Artagnan. Binnie Barnes,Lionel Atwill and Miles Mander excellent in their parts Milady,Rochefort and Cardinal Richelieu. Gloria Stuart,Joseph Schildkraut,Lester Matthews ,Pauline Moore,John Carradine good in their supporting roles as Queen Anne,King Louis,Constance and Naveau Bernajoux the Cardinal's spy. Is this a faithful adaptation? No,but a good one. Alot of this version was copied from the 1935 version. The D'Artagnan abduction scene an example. Note to those who love this version Miles Mander who played Cardinal Richelieu in this version played King Louis in the more serious 1935 version. The Musketeers in this version like the 1935 were getting a little long in the tooth but the performances were good. If you really enjoyed this comical take on the classic then you would probably like the Disney 1993 version (which copied from the 1935 and 1939 versions) and two Mexican versions one with Cantinflas 1942 (not dubbed in English) and Tin Tan's 1957 version which plays on the Nostalgia Channel and is dubbed in English. The funny thing about Tin Tan's version is the costumery looks just like that of the 1948 Gene Kelly version and Milady de Winter looks like a redheaded Janet Leigh. So if you like spoofs of classics you will like this.",983750400,9,1549,5.078431372549019

525796,3,6302982693,"Relax, literature lovers: The Ritz Brothers DON'T have the title roles in this, their only costume picture. Gallant swordsman D'Artagnan (Don Ameche, in a fine performance) takes on all comers to protect the Queen. Large sets  and a great cast of character players add to the atmosphere. Very well  directed by Allan Dwan (who had staged Douglas Fairbanks swashbucklers).  There's very little of the usual Ritz Brothers schtick in this, but they do  have an athletic precision-dance routine. The video's print quality is  excellent.",945129600,9,532,5.285714285714286

525850,4,6302982693,"This is a somewhat different version of the Three Musketeers being a comedy and a bit of a musical. The second half of the plot is close to the 1935 version of the Three Musketeers and far from Dumas' novel. I don't really know if I think the Ritz Brothers are very funny, but the film is elegant, Don Ameche is a handsome and good hero and you are very much intertained in a cosy family way.

Now how about releasing ""Straight, Place and Show"" and ""Kentucky Moonshine""",1343433600,,402,4.52054794520548

525856,3,6302982693,"This film takes the familiar Three Musketeers story and adds musical numbers and slapstick routines from the Ritz Brothers. It has a good cast both in the lead and minor roles, but it never reaches the heights in terms of entertainment. The songs are pleasant but undistinguished and this includes the opening song sung by Don Ameche and then reprised throughout the film at various times. The comedy routines from the Ritz Brothers are fairly amusing.

The film looks quite handsome with its appealing lead players,costumes and sets. The film is not long at 72 minutes and it is a pleasant way to pass that time if you enjoy this genre, which I do.",1197849600,,649,4.692982456140351
525857,4,6302982693,"Pauline Kael, Woody Allen and Mel Brooks all love the Ritz Brothers, and I do, too.  Comedy's notoriously difficult to analyze (one man's belly laugh is another fella's blank stare), so I'm at a loss to tell you why these guys crack me up -- but they're consistently enjoyable, even when handed the feeblest material (i.e., THE GOLDWYN FOLLIES).  Here, with some cheerfully second-rate songs to sing and surrounded by a first-rate production, they're great fun.  According to the DVD notes, this was a low-budget effort for Fox, but they spent their nickel well:  the movie looks swell.  A nice surprise to see Don Ameche as a swashbuckling musical lead; Gloria Stuart is lovely and intelligent, as always, and Binnie Barnes makes a dry, enjoyable (and quite comely) Lady De Winter.  And the storytelling here's remarkably efficient.  Even with the addition of the Ritz crackers, the songs, and assorted comic horseplay, all the bones of the Dumas classic are there in a brisk 74 minute film.  Certainly not the best, or best-known, version of this oft-lensed tale, but a highly enjoyable one for the entire family.  Worth checking out.",1195776000,,1136,4.968253968253968
525858,5,6302982693,"I do not understand why The Ritz Brothers are not better known. They could out-sing and out-dance most, if not all, other comedy teams. Sure their brand of humor is a matter of individual taste, but what humor isn't?
This is 72 minutes of unadulterated fun, partially faithful to Dumas' great novel, elaborately designed, wonderfully produced by Darryl Zanuck, and creatively directed by that ol' professional Allan Dwan. The supporting cast of Lional Atwill, John Carradine, Binnie Barnes, Gloria Stuart, Douglas Dumbrille, Miles Mander, etc. are superb, and more than support the dashing and vocally adept Don Ameche (okay, so he's no Allan Jones), and the hilarious Ritz Brothers. Yeah, they fit right in to my ""matters of taste."" Give them a try. 20th Century Fox needs to release more films on DVD of this wonderfully zany, incredibly talented trio.",1190073600,6,854,5.107142857142857
7832759,4,6302982693,"Surprisingly good, especially when compared to the painful to watch, Gene Kelly, MGM version. Pity it wasn't done in color. Some good music & action sequences. Don Amiche is also very good & the Ritz Brothers, though more subdued than in other pictures, are also fun.

7832762,3,6302982693,"In FOX's peculiar action-adventure/comedy amalgam of THE THREE MUSKETEERS (1939) the Ritz Brothers act more like the Stooges than gallant swordsmen. Don Ameche, who stars as D'Artagnan, fits right in to this madcap mess, even singing a few forgettable tunes. Elegant period costumes, especially those of Gloria Stuart and Binnie Barnes, are a highlight, yet ultimately director Allan Dwan plus a sterling cast that includes Pauline Moore, Joseph Schildkraut, Lionel Atwill and John Carradine are wasted.

BTW, Douglass Dumbrille, John 'Dusty' King and Russell Hicks have small roles as the REAL Athos, Aramis and Porthos.

7832764,5,6302982693,"Anyone familiar with the show ""Leave it to Beaver"" will remember that this is the movie that got Beaver Cleaver in a lot of trouble. He was supposed to read and write a book report on ""The Three Musketeers."" His friend Gilbert talks Beaver into watching this movie instead of reading the book. Anyone who's seen this version will notice that this film differs from the book a great deal. As for the movie itself, it may not be everyone's cup of tea, though children may love it. That's how I viewed the movie. I imagined myself an eleven or twelve year old sitting beside Beaver and Gilbert as they watched and laughed at the antics of the Ritz Brothers (sort of like the Three Stooges, but not as good, if you are unfamiliar with them.) I thought about what parts of the movie might appeal to a child the Beaver's age, which made me enjoy the film on that level. I also humorously thought about the look on Mrs. Rayburn's (Beaver and Gilbert's teacher) face as Beaver read his book report made from this movie. I can only imagine the look on her and the other kid's faces as Beaver recalls the funny scenes he saw in this film that were not in the original book. I guess what I'm really trying to say, if it makes any sense, is that, if you view this film through the eyes of a child, it might make you enjoy it more. The movie itself is a three to four star movie but, for making me feel like a kid again, I give it five stars and beyond.",1413849600,,1440,4.221014492753623

7832766,4,6302982693,"Forty minutes of this 72-minute swashbuckler / comedy / musical are quite entertaining, the remaining half-hour is not.  The latter is largely-comprised of cringe-inducing Ritz Brothers shenanigans, with the odd witticism that lands true.  My solution: watch the best bits, strung together into a coherent narrative, and skip the rest.  Thank goodness for chapter markers and remote controls!

40-Minute Musketeer:
Tracks 1-2 (0:00-4:30), Track 6 (11:30-13:15), Tracks 10-11 (23:15-31:00), Track 13 (35:00-36:00), Tracks 16-18 (46:40-57:00), (Track 19 - optional), Tracks 20-23 (58:18-72:00)

Skipping tracks 3-5, 7-9, 12, and 14-15 takes very little away from the story, and eliminates a lot of painfully bad comedy and some mediocre songs, while leaving all but a bit of the narrative and lots of lighthearted energy.  (Track 19 isn't bad -- and only 80-seconds long -- and keeping it allows one to set down the remote control at Track 16, but it adds nothing to the story.)

Don Ameche is actually a winning D'Artagnan and the other cast members (absent the Ritzes) are adequate to good.  The screenplay departs from Dumas in significant ways, but what ""Three Musketeers"" film doesn't?  The sets and costumes are gorgeous and the swordplay and chases are well-executed and thrilling.  Really, it's a fine swashbuckler, or 3/5ths of one.  I just wish the DVD wasn't copy-protected so I could make a copy for myself with the annoying bits gone.  Still, the chapter skip button on my remote does a pretty good job of making this a fun, if brief, ""One Musketeer""!
