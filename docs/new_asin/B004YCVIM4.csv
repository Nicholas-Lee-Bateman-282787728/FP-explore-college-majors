4498956,5,B004YCVIM4,"If you haven't heard, or even better SEEN, The Mummies, you are in for a treat.  Exciting stage presence with great musical technique and really creative lyrics make ""Here come the Mummies"" stand out.  Some songs are ""suggestive"" but really only in a hinting way.",1362096000,,263,4.822222222222222
4498957,5,B004YCVIM4,"Who are these guys?  No one knows, but they can really play.  HCTM are a talented band with a big brass section, playing funky music with a lot of heart and humor.  There are a lot of ""dirty jokes"" going around, mostly by Java Mummy, who has a gravelly voice.  Listen for the chains he rattles for ""VIP"" as well as quick asides on ""Funky Lady"".  I really like this live track version, as the group has matured a lot since the first album - you can check the different versions of their theme-song tune, ""Believe"", as well as ""Ra, Ra, Ra"".  This is just good music - it makes you laugh, move your feet, and brightens your day.  The charts are lively and the playing just fantastic.  This has become just about my favorite band.  The tracks I like include ""Pants"", ""Ra, Ra, Ra"", ""Tip Toe"", and especially ""Boom Boom Room"".",1349049600,,820,4.342105263157895

4498959,5,B004YCVIM4,"Where do I begin?  It's always very difficult to convince someone who has never heard a particular band that the band is actually incredibly good and super-entertaining.  Well, that's my dilemma with Here Come The Mummies.  If you don't know anything about them, they are a group of musicians from Nashville who got together and formed an anonymous band (thus the Mummy costumes) to play original, super-tight, super-catchy and super-good funk music.  This is NOT a bunch of rip-off artists trying to cash in on a dumb gimmick.  These guys are extremely talented, incredibly proficient musicians who play together as seemlessly as any band I have ever heard live.  And yes, that includes, Earth Wind and Fire, Chicago, Tower of Power, you name it. As of this writing, I have seen Here Come The Mummies live three times and they deliver big time each and every time.  I am a lifelong musician and I can say beyond a doubt that this band is as good as it gets if you like this type of music.  Their arrangements are very intricate, the horn parts are all memorized (no sheet music onstage), the vocals are great and the rhythm section is second to none.  I could go on and on but do yourself a BIG favor and buy this live dvd.  Crank up the home theater system and prepare to be amazed and blown away.",1339459200,4,1299,4.536480686695279
4498960,5,B004YCVIM4,"I have been a professional musician on and off for 40+ years and saw these guys on one of the morning shows on Halloween 2011.  I was instantly hooked by their musicianship, catchy funk, great scoring and just plain enjoyable musical collaboration.  I haven't gone around humming tunes to myself for years but their compositions are just a breath of fresh musical air in this age of over-digitized studio productions.  Yeah, the mummy schtick is OK, since I understand they have contracts with other recording labels and require some personal anonymity. Their presentation, the tight, wonderfully scored horns, coupled with some great bass lines make them an exceptional pleasure to listen to and to watch.  Their energy and enthusiasm is contagious. The funk isn't as heavy or lyrically deep as Parliament/Funkadelic or Mandrill; they're more reminiscent of an energetic BS&T, but hey, it's highly listenable and just plain refreshing in the music wasteland of 2011.  The DVD production and sound is excellent if just slightly visually overdone with cuts, but if you like the music and haven't seen these guys live (and I personally can't wait until I have the opportunity) this is a great way to experience them.  I'm ordering every album they have.",1324944000,7,1251,5.078048780487805
8448153,5,B004YCVIM4,"Blown Away!!! As a long time musician, I can's say enough about this group.  The instrument selection and arrangements are second to none.  To get this kind of music coupled with choreographed moves presents entertainment that is high energy and is sustained throughout the performance.  Highly recommended for anyone that truly enjoys  solid, professional and talented music presentation.",1481155200,,389,5.655172413793103
8448154,5,B004YCVIM4,"I stumbled across this band by sheer accident, when they played a concert in Wichita last month. Being a huge music fan, and former owner of a chain of 6 nightclubs (dance clubs with live music and seating capacities ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 people) in major US markets, I am always on the lookout for outstanding musical talent to add to my formidable music library at home. In this concert, my wife and I were absolutely stunned at how polished and ""groove driven"" that this band was. They performed in a rare venue that not only has a very high seating capacity, but has one of the largest capacity dance floors that I have ever come across, in a live performance venue. And what we witnessed that night was a group that drew everyone out of their seats and away from their drinks, to spend the entire performance, immediately in front of the stage, on their feet and grooving to the beat, keeping that dance floor crowded with several hundred, ""dancing in place"" spectators.

There is no secret to their success as musicians, being some of Nashville's ""most in demand"" session musicians, when not performing as the Mummies. Their identities are anonymous, disguised as Mummies, so as not to create any conflicts with the major recording labels, to which they are signed, as musicians. And purportedly two of which have received Grammies. I can't even begin to tell you how magnificent and entertaining they are. You have to simply witness it yourself by going to YouTube and viewing two sample songs, ""Ra Ra Ra"", and ""Do You Believe"", which I did before I attended that recent concert. I was instantly hooked on their whole shtick and cleverness of their lyrics, which they write themselves. They are like a mix between Santana, Earth Wind and Fire, The Commodores, Rolling Stones and whomever else is high up the food chain in Blues, Rock and R&B. They are too diverse to try to try to pin down or classify. Which makes them so totally unique. Added to their musical superiority, are well choreographed Motown style ""move in unison"" on stage antics, and you have a recipe for sheer entertainment and dance-ability. My wife and I were smiling ear to ear the entire night, while dancing our butts off.  WOW.

So naturally, after the concert, I instantly went to Amazon and bought this DVD. And I wanted their other DVD which is only available on the Mummies website. Got both and watched both, which were equal to the task of the live performance which we witnessed in Wichita. It is now in my top 5 favorite concert DVD's, of all time (I have about 80 concert DVD's in my home library). I have friends who did not get to attend the concert with us, but after I raved about the Mummies, and them knowing I bought the two DVD's, requested to come over and see it on my 144"" screen, in high def from my 3D projection system. To a person, everyone has said very simply, ""WOW"" and sorry they missed them live.

This one DVD that will raise a smile on your face and entertain you beyond expectation with extremely tight grooves and fantastic showmanship. You will not regret one minute of watching these masters in concert. So go to YouTube and watch the two songs mentioned above, and if you like the two songs, you will love the entire DVD performance. Kudos to unknown power players.",1466121600,2,3287,4.613675213675213

With our external speakers on it was like being there.  My husband is a drummer with over 40 years of making music and my brother who has been playing guitar for even longer both agree that these guys are so ""tight"".  We love Here Come The Mummies!",1430006400,,377,4.391304347826087
