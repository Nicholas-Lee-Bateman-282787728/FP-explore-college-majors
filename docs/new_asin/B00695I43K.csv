This is an Asylum low budget film, but even so it could have been far better. Some of the characters spoke in modern English while others adopted a 17th century hybrid. Britain is under attack by Pics (which we don't see enough) Saxons and dragons. Merlin as an apprentice has to save them.

For a ten year old child this movie may be enjoyable. There is no swearing, sex, nudity, or even sex talk. The dragon effects were acceptable for the low budget aspect of Asylum. The sound track could have been better. The opening narration could have been far better. The lead role and acting in general was laughable. The speech given on the horse to rouse the troops was a hoot. While the man is talking the horse seems to have a mind of its own while walking around and making sudden jerks and turns. The magic was just great. A spell is cast, the camera pans away, and then comes back and suddenly something appears!

This is a bad ow budget film, but for some strange unexplained MST reason it held my interest.",1417132800,,1115,4.434146341463415
