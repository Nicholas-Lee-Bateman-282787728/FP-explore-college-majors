We can all relate to the relationships among these workers in a South African animal rescue shelter as the action unfolds in a locality as intriguing as it is unfamiliar to many of us.  The result?  A delightful movie viewing experience.  Mr. Bamford and company, what next?",1162857600,3,414,5.242424242424242

2596690,5,B000G0O5HI,"I give this film ""nine"" stars! Actually of course only five stars are possible.

A Baha'i producer Kevin Bamford has come out with what I consider to be a fine movie with real down to earth values...

A quote from Baha'u'llah initiates the film:

""To blessed animals the utmost kindness must be shown, the more the better. Tenderness and loving-kindness are basic principles of God's heavenly Kingdom. Ye should most carefully bear this matter in mind.""

And the central character ""Kate"" (played by Debbie Brown) operates an animal rescue operation in Cape Town South Africa! Kate's Mum played by Clare Marshall well I dunno I'll leave that for you to decide but she gives a great performance.

Eric Ebouaney plays ""Jean Claude"" who works and lives at the Shelter is a kind of dog whisperer and great hearted soul who as an astronomer volunteers on the side at an Observatory telling visiting students in a hushed way that the real reason the universe holds together is ""love""...Wow! straight out of Abdul-Baha's words!

Also you could say this is definitely a dog-lover's film!

I won't detail the film so as to spoil it for you but this I think is a ""must see"".. There are some adult themes though and violence although you will not see any steamy or graphic sexual scenes either... I think young adults maybe over fifteen could see this film.

2596691,1,B000G0O5HI,"This DVD was purchased as present for my Mother in Bath, UK and wouldn't play in her DVD player.

She was looking forward to it as she lived a lot of her life in Rhodesia.",1156118400,2,171,3.8857142857142857
2596692,2,B000G0O5HI,"This DVD was released in non-anamorphic widescreen, a complete shame in this day and age. I'm glad this movie is finally on DVD since it wasn't shown in my area but the poor treatment it received on DVD is a crime. The features are minimal.  Independent films like this should have superior DVD editions so you actually want to own them. Skip buying this and rent it instead.",1155859200,2,375,4.514705882352941
2596693,5,B000G0O5HI,"If you want to watch an utterly charming, feel-good film, this is the one for you.

One of a number of films coming out of South Africa these days. Cape of God Hope fires on all cylanders... fine acting from a cast with few major credits betwen them. Neatly photographed and astonishingly well directed by Mark Bamford on location in S. Africa.

Buy this film. You'll watch it agan and again many times.",1152403200,3,403,4.506849315068493

Charming, deep and sweet.",1404345600,,49,7.333333333333333
8128169,5,B000G0O5HI,"I might be slightly biased because my (now deceased) Gizmo had a scene or few in the movie (she's the one scratching at the door in the beginning, I was sitting just behind the door quietly calling her!), so of course I had to buy the movie!
  Knowing nothing more about the movie other than the scenes Gizmo was required in, I was pleasantly surprised at the story that unfolded.
  I'm usually not in favour of South African actors as they often come across rehearsed and unnnatural, but this movie I have watched a few times now and every time I find it charming, real, and heartwarming.

  Definately a movie I recommend everyone to watch, as somehow everyone can relate to at least one of the characters. My favourite was Jean-Claude. Excellent actor! Very natural!

The only thing that bothered me in the storyline, is when Kate goes into a township late at night by herself. No matter what year this is set in, no (white) person will just sommer do that in South Africa lol.",1394841600,,980,4.528409090909091
8128170,5,B000G0O5HI,"This movie is about how important it is to forgive to be able to move on with life. In society forgiveness is given as a favor or a gift, but forgiveness is not a gift. It is need it to live a full and healthy life.",1361836800,,215,3.6956521739130435
8128171,3,B000G0O5HI,"Several story lines merge and overlap in an ensemble cast tale about life and love in S Africa amid the strays of a dog pound. Every time the action flags, you can bet it's time for a cute dog scene. Racial issues darken the vibe towards the end, and it all gets off to a very slow start. But it's worth sticking around for a night of mild entertainment.",1239408000,2,354,4.144927536231884
8128172,5,B000G0O5HI,"I really enjoyed this fine comedy. I hadn't known quite what to expect when I ordered it; I'd been curious about the fact that it was set in South Africa, but I'd been apprehensive for the same reason. Just about all of the African movies I'd ever seen had been focused on one or another of the continent's many traumas and tragedies, and while each movie had been beautifully crafted and critically acclaimed and was in all respects an excellent movie (take _Hotel Rwanda_, for example), I'd still had to brace myself to see it.

So I'm so happy that this movie exists--a movie shot in present-day South Africa that, while not sugarcoating the country's continuing problems (racial inequalities, poverty, violence, a disturbing amount of xenophobia, etc.), is nonetheless full of hope and even humor. It's a movie in which people live and work together, deal with their problems together, and gradually move forwards with their lives. And in the process they make for some pretty entertaining watching. It's not the kind of movie where the humor comes from exaggerating stereotypes; rather, it's a gentler kind of fun, where the comedy comes from each character's/actor's own sense of humor. There's a Muslim woman character, for example, who walks off with some of the funniest scenes in the entire movie--her changing facial expressions in one scene, as she teases her boss who's on the phone with a feckless lover, are worth the price of the DVD alone. And one learns so much about life in present-day South Africa too. A real treasure!",1214697600,,1540,4.900383141762452
8128173,4,B000G0O5HI,"I so enjoyed this movie....it was well-done, and I loved the interconnected stories which never seemed contrived. Well-acted and with great fleshing out of all the characters, and a terrific local ""flavor"" due to the fact that the movie was filmed on location in South Africa and all the actors were from there. A good move on the part of the producers..

It is a story of hope and love - and people whom the viewer can actually care about. It shows that most people care about family, love, and jobs, not politics.",1197763200,3,515,4.537634408602151
8128174,3,B000G0O5HI,"We enjoyed this movie because of the interesting story and the characters. Note: there are some shots that go to far an are not needed, parent watch first before your kids watch it.",1186617600,4,181,4.515151515151516
8128175,5,B000G0O5HI,This is the sort of enamoring film that Hollywood just can't do anymore with it's recycled string of naricistic and crappy actors.  This is a beautiful tale in modern day South Africa.  It is a wonderful film- I don't want to ruin it by talking too much about the plot- just see it.,1174089600,3,282,4.30188679245283
8128176,5,B000G0O5HI,"Mark Bamford's 'Cape of Good Hope' is a small charmer about life in the new South Africa.  The heart and soul of the film is Eriq Ebouaney (best known for his portrayal as Patrice Lumumba in Raoul Peck's 'Lumumba' (2000)).  He plays ""Jean Claude"" here.  You'll love every scene he's in.  He's fabulous.

I came here thinking I'd write a four-star review.  But it's so maddening to see people write one- and two-star reviews because they can't get the DVD to play.  How fair is that to Director Mark Bamford and his ensemble?  I'm giving Bamford's very enjoyable work an additional star to combat the effects of those reviews.",1170201600,4,625,4.669724770642202
