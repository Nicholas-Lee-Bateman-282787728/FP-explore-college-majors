8055467,1,B00082ZQTK,"I have seen this movie many times and wanted to get it for the longest time.  Unfortunately it is not what I was hoping to get.  First, the 'previews' are all for american movies.... This is a mexican movie! Because they are old they don't have 'previews'!.  Second, the movie gets cut often, like the songs are not complete, the beginning is more like a bunch of sequences cut together instead of the actual beginning.  I definitely did not like this purchase.  I purchased another movie from the same time period with the same actor, (Pedro Infante), and that movie was awesome.  It had no 'previews', the movie was complete and in the menu it had a lot of 'extras'.  It was also cheaper than this movie.
The movie did show up on time, that's about the only good thing.",1270425600,2,771,4.464285714285714

SYNOPSIS: This marvelous 1952 romantic comedy, directed by Ismael Rodriguez, is representative of Mexico's golden age of cinema and brings together Jorge Negrete and Pedro Infante.  Negrete's operatic voice and dashing persona contrasts nicely with Pedro Infante's warm, romantic voice and charismatic persona.  Jorge Bueno and Pedro Malo are best friends who consider giving up their womanizing ways when they each fall in love. As fate would have it, Pedro Malo unexpectedly marries Jorge Bueno's girlfriend, and the conflict between the former buddies begins.  A year later they find themselves in the same town and confront each other once and for all.  The music is beautiful and the sparks fly as they learn a good lesson about love and true friendship.",1195084800,5,1012,5.029940119760479
