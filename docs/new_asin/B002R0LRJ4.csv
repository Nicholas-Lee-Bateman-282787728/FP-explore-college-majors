8378255,5,B002R0LRJ4,"Ranchero is a thought provoking, emotionally poignant indie drama. Don't be fooled by the presence of Danny Trejo in a fine supporting role. This movie is for lovers of indie cinema; not the latest Machette installment.",1470873600,,219,5.111111111111111
8378256,2,B002R0LRJ4,"Jesse Torrez (Roger Gutierrez) is a ranchero, son of a ranchero. He has saved up enough money to go to the big city to live. There is meets up with Tommy (Brian Eric Johnson) who has become too involved in the local scene to find his way back home. Jesse tries to help Tommy who appears nonredeemable. Jesse doesn't try to save the world, just his ""Lil' Bit"" (Christina Woods) of it, a young girl with secrets. Danny Trejo makes an appearance at the end of the feature. Oh, Jesse also likes to take black and white realistic somewhat gritty photos.

The film is an indie drama with a faux gritty background. It is a boring look at character and relationships. The theme of the film is that real men work long tiresome jobs and don't become bad guys.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Sex talk.",1371340800,,802,4.412162162162162
8378257,5,B002R0LRJ4,This isn't an action film. It's more of a love story. A great performance by Christina Woods and Don DiLego's wonderful soundtrack make this well worth the price of entry.,1370563200,,171,4.733333333333333
8378258,4,B002R0LRJ4,"Do not be fooled by the cover picture, which would lead you to believe that Danny Trejo is the lead actor in this movie.  He has a very small bit part toward the end of the movie. So if you are a Danny Trejo fan, don't even bother with this one.",1354924800,6,245,3.803921568627451
