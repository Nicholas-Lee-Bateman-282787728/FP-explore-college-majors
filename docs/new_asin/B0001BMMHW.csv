1986210,5,B0001BMMHW,"Brad Fraser is an excellent writer and has elected to move his successful play ""Poor Super Man"" (1994) onto the screen with great success.  Fraser is also a writer and co-producer for the enormously popular ""Queer as Folk"" television series and he knows his subjects well.  He has the ability to write about the gay world without making a 'gay movie' primarily because he shows such comfort with the variations in gender identities that he can explore all facets.  The result is a film that is more about people than about stereotypes, and a fine job he does in writing scenes for characters who, in other director's hands, might seem contrived at best and silly at worst.
The story revolves around a gifted young painter David (Troy Ruptash) who lives with a transsexual friend who is awaiting gender-altering surgery while coping with the cold fact of being HIV positive (Shannon - played by a very fine actor whose name passed by too fast on the screen to acknowledge).  David also has an alcoholic over-the-hill blonde reporter Kryka (again, played to perfection by an actress whose name flew by in the credits).  David has painter's block and to escape that state he seeks anonymous employment as a waiter to observe life, seeking visual input for his canvases.  The Main Street Diner is run by a newly married couple - Matt (Vincent Corazza) and Violet (Cherilee Taylor).  David eyes the apparent 'straight guy' Matt and is surprised to find his gaze returned. The closeted Matt has a fling with David which produces a successful break for David's painter's block (he paints beautiful nude images of Matt without Matt's knowing it) and an unsuccessful dissolution of Matt's marriage.  The active foil in all of this is Kryka and she is the undoing of the affairs.  Meanwhile Shannon faces her imminent demise from AIDS and it is this peak of verismo that shakes all the superficiality down and results in some important changes in the characters.
On the surface the story may sound a bit on the soap opera side, but in Fraser's hands and with the accomplished acting of this physically beautiful cast, it all works. The cinematography is beautiful, the art designing is excellent (the paintings David paints are the creations of a fine artist), and the musical score is sensitive, witty, and well edited.  Brad Fraser is a force to contend with and if there is anyone able to incorporate the 'gay world' into mainstream moviemaking, he surely is on top of the list. Despite some fine steamy scenes (Matt in bed with both Violet and then with David), this film is for general audiences who are open to understanding the meaning of extended family.  A first-class film.",1081814400,41,2673,4.827133479212254
1986211,3,B0001BMMHW,"""Leaving Metropolis,"" from Brad Fraser, is set in Canada. It's top character is David (Troy Ruptash), a painter. He enters a small diner, run by marrieds Matt (Vince Corazza) and Violet (Cherilee Taylor). David is well-groomed, tasteful, articulate. Matt and Violet are working-class folks who are independent restaurant owners. They are not well-groomed or articulate. These three -- separated in two categories -- come from different worlds. And they're about to converge.

Now before you think I'm going to describe point-by-point (much of which you can find in other reviews) about what happens in ""Leaving Metropolis,"" let's just consider it a journey.

""Leaving Metropolis is the story of a single man' life and that of a marriage interrupted by a third wheel -- with a twist -- and we see secondary stories in the life of David: a saucy, female pal, Kryla (Lynda Boyd); and another friend (played by Thom Allison) who is mourning over the loss of a lover.

This is also a film in which it is the single man who is honest and fulfilled; strangely, it's Matt and Violet, both apprently without friends, who are not. They appear bored. And this is one more part of Fraser's portrait of these separate lives that makes this journey somewhat unexpected. But they won't be for much longer.

If you've read others' reviews, you can tell that ""Leaving Metropolis"" is a love story. Of the unusual kind. In my efforts not to spoil, I've come to realize there's no point in holding back an important fact: ""Leaving Metropolis' is the story a single man, who is gay, and his life -- and that of the lives of the ""straight"" couple he meets -- becomes changed.

Having first seen the film as a rental from a popular -- and unnamed -- videostore chain, I was left with skepticism. ""Leaving Metropolis"" -- which plays at 89 minutes for the unrated version -- isn't long enough. It doesn't allow for enough character development. The supporting characters, alas, play like stock figures, the requisites expected in the makings of a ""gay"" film. And, with the exception of a memory Matt shares with David (while enjoying some beer), we don't get a feel for who these folks really are. To simply describe the them isn't enough; to say what happens isn't enough; these formerly still waters need to run deeply. Very deeply.

Performances by Ruptash, Corazza, and Taylor help to alleviate the quality of this film. They're sincere and honest. Ruptash's and Corazza's so-called bravery in their love scenes (director Fraser's commentary mentions that Corazza is straight and a married father) helps us understand the males' attractions. There's no holding back there, and it's good for delivering this film with power.

What has sold me on ""Leaving Metropolis"" is the context and the complexity of the characters' situation. Even though the exploration didn't satisfy, the journey was quite interesting. And worthwhile. ""Leaving Metropolis"" is worthy of a few viewings.",1121558400,9,2953,4.965587044534413
1986212,4,B0001BMMHW,"Fraser's film is truly a winner in production quality.  His attention to detail by bringing in his theatrical savvy is a nonpareil.  Despite all the cliches that can be stated about this film; eye-candy performers, lighting, fantastic musical score, and riske scenes, this film has visually appealing sequences.  If anyone is interested in film and theatrical production, I would highly recommend the director's commentary-you really get an insight to an artist in process.  From the commentary, it seems that Fraser will never be finished with this film: a mentale that I admire in an artist.  Art is a process and is never perfect.

This is another one of those great modern plays that works very well for the film.  Getting to the roots of the human psyche is something films should continue into the future.  This film does explore the 3 dimensionality of people.

I did have a problem with the didacticism of the script however.  Though most writers try to leave it up to the audience to decide, I feel that the script gave little regard for wives who are victims of their husbands having gay affairs.  I had to agree with another reviewer who titled his review as ""Selfish gay guy ruins a marriage"". (On the other hand, Cherilee Taylor did a great job in combating this fault with the script; she wasn't quite the victim her character ultimately could have become.)  By the end of the film, I was wondering how Violet was making it as a once again as single woman.  From an audience's standpoint, we didn't really see that.  David and Kryla make up, Matt goes to illustration school, but what happens to Violet?

Overall, I would highly recommend this film.  With such a great interpretation on the screen, it would be nice to see this staged once again in the lort theatres.",1118880000,8,1781,4.733766233766234
1986213,5,B0001BMMHW,"I was just really able to appreciate this film.  Sure there were some lines that I didn't like and and I was a little unclear about some plot aspects and I wished we could have seen what happens to the characters after the film ended.  But overall, I really loved the message of the film and the originality of it.  This is a film about love, sexuality, and relationships.  It was really beautiful.  Most of what I must praise highest is the acting.  Every single person was casted perfectly for what their unique talents offered.  Corazza's is a VERY believable and truthful actor.  His acting lends himself to innocence and sympathy -- just what Matt needed.  Taylor was brilliant.  She exudes power and assurance.  And she played every one of her very difficult lines absolutely perfectly.  She was perfection.  Allison was surprising convincing and excellent.  I say surprising because for a man dressed in woman's clothing, this is the first movie where I actually LIKED the character and this character was believable and not a stupid stereotype.  Shannon was real person for me.  Boyd was absolutely excellent.  She seems to be the most experienced and a clear veteran of the art.  They were so lucky to get her for this.  She's a world-class actress.

This film was just really enjoyable.  I really found the writer's (Fraser) commentary to be especially interesting.  This film was daring, original, and well-directed.  A little unbelievable at points, but enjoyable none the less.",1108252800,15,1490,4.919354838709677
1986214,2,B0001BMMHW,"This movie is so mixed with good points and bad that when the movie is finished you really feel nothing for the characters. The bodies and faces of the actors are beautiful, stunning in fact, but what lies beneath is a heaping mess. David, the gay painter, is so consumed with himself (as his friend is dying) and Matt (the husband) is stumbling with his sexual idenity crisis that in trying to find himself he destroys others in his wake. The only real character that shines, but briefly, is Violet (the wife) who gives us a small glimpse of a woman that is betrayed and caught in a bewildering situation which she has no real way to vent her fustration. Overall the paintings and beautiful people are nice to look at, but the overacting by David and Matt and a storyline that is scant finds one leaving metropolis and heading for the hills.",1104364800,11,842,4.509803921568627
1986215,3,B0001BMMHW,"Perhaps it is heart.  The story isn't bad, the acting isn't bad, and the production values were impressive.  Everyone in the movie, though, seems bent on self-destruction, from the gay guy who knows he can't have the ""straight"" guy, the ""straight"" guy's wife (who sends her husband happily into the gay guy's arms,) and the ""straight guy,"" who is hard to sympathize with because he just seems eager to please himself without regard to anyone else.  I didn't love the supporting cast, and the end left me unsatisfied. A bit too much straight sex and far less gay sex didn't encourage me.

Tone down the sex (it wasn't interesting) and give the characters some redeemability, and this piece would earn at least one more star.

Worth seeing in a pinch, but not the best.  (...)",1102723200,16,774,4.696296296296296
1986216,2,B0001BMMHW,"The boys are cute, the filmaking OK, sex scenes hot....but once again the gay guy ruins lives... seduces a married man and thinks nothing of the wife or her feelings. All end up miserable....not a message I would hope for- no good comes of this affair.",1096761600,24,252,4.5
1986217,3,B0001BMMHW,"The best thing about Leaving Metropolis is the arresting visual sense of director Brad Fraser, adapting his own stage play Poor Super Man. Almost every scene and set is filled with vivid colors and striking compositions, making the film a delight for the viewer's eye. The presence of a trio of physically attractive principals who are frequently seen in various stages of undress does not hurt either.

It probably marks a certain coming of age in gay/lesbian cinema that lots of nudity and hot (albeit soft-core) sex, both gay and straight, doesn't guarantee a good film these days. All the eye candy in Leaving Metropolis cannot disguise major problems in this story of a troubled painter (Troy Ruptash) who, for rather contrived reasons, moonlights as a waiter in a diner owned by a married couple (Vincent Corazza and Cherilee Taylor) and becomes enamored of the husband, with disastrous emotional consequences for all. This by now familiar love triangle still has possibilities; that they are not realized here is due not only to a script that, though occasionally witty, is more often trite and overblown, but above all to the stiff and stagy Ruptash, who is unable to rise above the level of cold reading in his performance. Corazza and Taylor are better, the former in particular managing to suggest the anguish of a man caught in the grasp of whirlwind emotions beyond his control. As in many flawed films of this sort, however, a subsidiary character steals the show: Thom Allison's turn as Ruptash's doomed, transgendered best friend projects genuine emotion largely missing from the rest of the proceedings.",1094601600,38,1620,5.022304832713755
1986218,4,B0001BMMHW,"I enjoyed the film "" Leaving Metropolis"" for many reasons. The acting was good and it had a good script. It was a bit raw and had an edge however it was believable and struck me as situations that some of my friends from the past would get themselves into. The production quality was good and so was the audio quality. The Artist ""David"" has painters block and takes a job as a waiter to try to get unblocked. He gets a romantic notion towards his married employer ""Matt"", Who appears to like the idea of getting together with David. David is unethical in his behavior, but that makes the story facinating to watch. The film is funny at times and also has it's fair share of drama. It had some very suggestive scenes however they fit the situation. It was a good addition to my collection and a good investment. The situations shown in the film are good for heated debate if you like that sort of thing.",1084233600,8,903,4.349112426035503
1986219,1,B0001BMMHW,"If bad writing, implausible situations, and poor directing appeal to you, then you will love this film.  I see at  least 150 films a year..... BAD ones are easy to spot; the lapses in continuity alone were enough to make me want to leave the theatre.  If you're curious about this film, rent it, don't buy.",1081987200,6,306,4.428571428571429
8009634,4,B0001BMMHW,"This is an entertaining film with very attractive actors.  Extremely attractive actors.  You watch these men and think ""I wonder what it's like to BE them.""  But the love story ends in a way that may be realistic but is such a downer that it kind of brings the whole thing down.  The director's commentary in voice-over suggests what happens to the characters after the film ends and I wish that had been included,  With those plot suggestions in mind, it's a much more upbeat story.  Did I mention how hot the guys are?",1481414400,,520,4.4787234042553195
8009635,3,B0001BMMHW,"I came twice to watch this film in a lapse of more than ten years. What motivated to write a review was the recall I had from it, when the character David (Troy Huptash)  the painter, curses  his best friend Kryla (Lynda Boyd)  Faghag. That shocked me, coming from a gay man. And that was one of the few memoirs I had from the film. Seeing it a second time just showed I was right: it has nothing remarkable. In particular, I still have the feeling that Huptash acting has nothing profound  he seemed to read his lines. I would say that Matt (Vincent Corazza) character is deeper. He really shows hes torn between this wife and his new found lover David. Besides, Corazza is a piece of a man, well build developed and a good actor.
Overall, its a film to be watched, perhaps even twice as I did. Another predicate is to say it aged well. The conflicts shown are undying and worth reflection from the viewer.",1479513600,,907,4.349112426035503
8009636,4,B0001BMMHW,"I agree with reviewer Grady Harp (in his Amazon.com and .ca review) that Brad Fraser's ""Leaving Metropolis"" (the French version cleverly titled ""Fantasmopolis"") is a successful film adaptation of his play, ""Poor Super Man"". However, having seen, many years ago, the stageplay before the film even was made, I think that it is safe to say that the initial theatre version is a somewhat more cogent piece of dramatic work than the movie and its screenplay are; the text of the play in an illustrated edition is available as published by NeWest Press, for those who wish to make the comparisons.  On reading that text, however, the differences between the play as I had remembered the production which I saw years ago and the way that the movie conveys it really are relatively minor.  The deft use of captions, flashing on the stage, really do add, significantly, many moments of irony and humour, which the film, in omitting the captions, loses, becoming more pervasively grim than the play is.

One of the crucial  disparities between film and movie, has to do with Shannon, the transsexual who is afflicted with AIDS.  The film adds a final scene of emotional hysteria lacking in the play, one that provides a tastelessly excessive ending to the movie (as David stands, nearly naked outdoors, on the edge of the roof of the buiding in which he and Shannon have lived, convulsed in heavy sobs, and empties the urn with Shannon's ashes into the air over the city, the camera then panning to the city at ground level, as Matt is seen walking to the railroad station very early in the morning to leave for somewhere else to continue his life).  The play, more ambiguously, less explicitly, and with more welcome restraint and ambiguity, comes to an end fading on several of its characters, who part from each other, at least for awhile, to continue their lives without each other's love and friendship. The presence of the maudlin subplot concerning Shannon and the scourge of AIDS, because of those crude final cinematic touches, looms larger in the movie, distracting rather than amplifying in any truly useful way the main action that occurs between the characters of the love triangle of Matt (played by adorable ""studmuffin"" Vince Corazza), his wife Violet, and interloper David.  (Anyway, there long has been an abundance of ""AIDS plays"" and ""AIDS films"", so Fraser should not have felt it essential to belabour this gay public and personal health issue in either version, stage or cinematic, of this particular drama.)  The play and especially the movie would have benefitted from excising the part of Shannon altogether. Instead, the film emphasises Shannon's plight in the final, emotionally manipulative gesture of emptying of the funerary urn at the film's conclusion.

There are other differences which have their respective cumulative impacts on the play and on the movie.  If ever another filmed adaptation of the work is made, I would hope that it would revert to the dramatic unity and lighter touch of the charming and witty play in its original form (or, even better, as it could be altered to remove Shannon's character altogether) as more of a filmed play than as the kind of movie that ""Leaving Metropolis"" is. That said, this is superior gay cinema, certainly well above the usual lot of low production cost hence gay-TV-like fare that Wolfe Video's own product line tends to release (but, unsurprisingly, did not produce in this case, the film having come out long before Wolfe picked it up to add to its video line, bearing catalogue number WOL-3851-D, being the edition with lean-and-lanky Troy Ruptash as ""David"" on the front cover photo nearly naked, with only a closely rumpled towel covering his loins; there is another DVD edition available also). So, despite a lingering preference for the play (which I can indulge by reading the playscript), I commend the video of this unusually fine gay motion picture.",1306195200,3,3934,4.929003021148036

8009639,3,B0001BMMHW,"This DVD is a mixed product with some very good aspects and some aspects that could have been done better.

First, the good parts:

The art direction and cinematography were super with colorful attractive interiors and attractive actors. Vincent Corazza does a good job playing Matt, a married man who ventures into a bisexuality. Cherilee Taylor is also exceptional as Violet, his wife. Thom Allison, playing the role of Shannon, a dying male to female transgender, is a high point of the film. The nudism and sex scenes were hot with Ms. Taylor and Mr. Corazza burning up the screen in the final scene of their love making.

Now for the parts that could be improved:

Brad Fraser's script was a bit too flip, too cute, and too witty. This had the effect of making both the main character, David, and his straight woman friend, Kryka, seem thin, superficial, and two dimensional. The problem here is that David is the main character and is suppose to fall in love with Matt the married man. However, the viewer never really believes this. In fact, the way too clever script forces the viewer not to really trust or believe anything the main character, David, says or does. What a shame. I suspect this major fault in the film must be blamed on Brad Fraser, the writer, rather than on Troy Ruptash the actor. When David tells Matt that he loves him, the words don't sound true. Later when David leaves Shannon to commit suicide alone, I suspected that the viewer really is lead to not sympathize with this main character at all. I found myself admiring and identifying mostly with Violet, the beautiful wife of bisexual Matt. She seemed to be the most sure of her emotions and sure of where she stood once she learned the truth about her husband's affair with David.

In the end, everyone moves on. David packs up and leaves town. Violet sells her diner and moves on. Matt despirately tries to rekindle the relationship with Violet and then when he is rejected tries to rekindle the relationship with David. In some ways he becomes the most complex character - a handsome Mr. Personality with dependency needs. Matt turns out to be one of those type people who can not stand to sleep alone and do the hard work to explore/find out who he really is on the inside.

The script needed far less catty remarks and far more character development. At least we were left with an untidy and realistic ending for sometimes when relationships get broken, they really can't be glued back together.",1157932800,8,2485,4.662100456621005
8009640,4,B0001BMMHW,"because I found this to be a film with a great narrative.  There is a flow from beginning to end, a view of relationships of different kinds.  Some folks may be responding to the fact that there is no happy ending in this film, but there is no tragedy either.  Instead the viewer is given hints about life moving forward, thus an ability to project out over time.  The relationships are true to life, and the way that HIV is treated is the most realistic I have seen on film (it is just there, integrated, not a theme).  Personally, I was fine with the technical aspects of the film, feeling like the filming and light reflected the northwestern canadian setting.

I have suggested this film to several friends - just expect a film that is more like a short-story than a romantic comedy.",1151712000,4,787,4.468531468531468
8009641,3,B0001BMMHW,i bought this dvd a while ago and rewatched it last night for the first time after a while.....I just found the characters so two dimensional...the story wants to take of..but does not really sucseed...And the actors did not really delft very deep into their emotions... abit dissapointing...,1150329600,2,292,5.104166666666667
8009642,2,B0001BMMHW,"The best thing about this movie was Vincent Corazza. Working with crappy dialog and a plot that tackled too many issues, he did a fantastic job expressing his character's confusing emotions without the need for words. This movie would have been really great had it stuck to the primary plot of a relationship between a married heterosexual man and a gay man. The main plot should have dealt soley with the bisexual issue and concepts of love, rather than bring in HIV, transgendered issues, fatal illnesses, dealing with the death of friends, euthanasia, etc.

Like so many 'gay' themed movies out there, it is morbid, sad, and filled with pain and suffering. Plus it deals with so many psychological issues that viewers tend to get lost and can't connect with any of the characters. Could have been much better. It's worth a look though, for Vince Corazza.",1148688000,7,857,4.829931972789115
8009643,3,B0001BMMHW,"David (Troy Ruptash) is a gay painter going through a bad time artistically who decides-- in order to get fresh inspiration--  to get a job in a restaurant owned by Matt (Vincent Corazza) and his wife Violet (Cherille Taylor.) David also has a best girl friend-- doesn't every gay man?-- Kryla (Lynda Boyd) and a pre-op transexual friend Shannon played by Thom Allison. The movie is written and directed by Brad Fraser and adapted from his 1994 play POOR SUPER MAN. Further facts: Matt allgedly is straight; Kryla has a serious moral streak that allows her to meet men on the internet but permits her to make severe judgments about her best friends; Shannon-- the most endearing character in the film-- has AIDS. With all this things going on, you have the makings of a first class work of art-- a gay man falling for a straight man; the betrayed wife, someone very ill with AIDS-- or soap opera. Unfortunately, in this instance the soap wins.  The acting for the most part is adequate, and there are nice touches-- the cuddling after the steamy sex scene between Violet and Matt where she is clothed and he isn't, for example, and the footage where Shannon and David sleep together because of Shannon's advanced illness. (I remember a dear friend who died in the 80's and all his close circle of friends stayed in bed with him to comfort him.) The film, however, degenerates into a crying game with enough blame to go around although the prize must go to David's rooftop sobbing jag. And wouldn't any gay man worth his Judy Garland CD's have told the restaurant owners to f--k off and walked off the job immediately when they called him the F word early on in the story? Finally, do serious artists only paint while wearing nothing but boxer briefs?

I watched the DVD version of the movie a second time with Mr. Fraser's commentary, always a risky undertaking for any director. A great movie doesn't require the creator's justification for producing it. With anything less than great, the director rarely convinces the viewer to change his mind after hearing his explanation for what he was trying to do. Mr. Fraser, who discusses some of the negative criticism the movie received, says that it is not a ""gay"" movie but rather is about intimacy and sexuality. He admits that the references to Superman don't work in the film because he was not permitted to use any of the Superman imagery or logos and that, given the opportunity again, he would have done some things differently. On the other hand, he frequently uses such superlatives as ""wonderful,"" ""fabulous,"" ""great"" and ""terrific"" to describe this work that he ""loves.""

I suspect that much of the melodrama in the film works much better in the stage version. Many of my friends whose critical opinion I value tell me that Mr. Fraser does fine work on QUEER AS FOLK and swear by that show,  one of the reasons I rented the DVD. This movie, however, is disappointing.",1128816000,10,2925,4.693957115009747
