7967055,4,B00006CXGQ,This is a funny video. I have the one named Thumbwars also.  These are decent videos to show to kids.  Video was received in excellent condition.,1319328000,,145,4.538461538461538
7967056,5,B00006CXGQ,"Once you get past the idea of thumbs portraying characters in a classic literature story, you will love it.  It stays fairly true to the original story of the misunderstood monster but as long as you are not expecting academy award material you will not be disappointed.  So very funny!  We originally bought this for our preteen age son, but were happy to find that the entire family loved it.  A must have for all those who love crazy, random humor.",1239494400,,451,4.530864197530864
7967057,5,B00006CXGQ,Hello there. This movie is great! It starts off with a funeral then a scientist digs up the grave and turns it into Frankin Thumb! Oh right the middle is good the ending is good and the movie is good too. So enjoy!,1061164800,,214,4.0
7967058,4,B00006CXGQ,"The originality of Oedekerk's works are pure genius.  From all that I have seen, these thumb movies will make you laugh over and over again, if not they will at least keep you smiling.  I would recommend to anyone who is an Oedekerk/thumb movie fanatic.
  I admit, it is not the best thumb movie of them all, but it was sure great.  With all the visual gags that are pulled and corny little jokes that are made, this is a funny movie.",1051142400,4,434,4.2439024390243905
7967059,4,B00006CXGQ,"Bat-thumb was good, thumbtanic kinda stunk, blair thumb- pretty good, Frankenthumb- really good. Oedenkirk goes back to his evil/funny ways in this diddy. There are precious little gems in the writing that only Oedenkirk could do, and they are in a German village (so the accents are hysterical). Thumb Fans: rejoice.",1035504000,6,317,5.235294117647059
7967060,5,B00006CXGQ,"First of all...  I am sure it will be just as hilarious as all the others.  Although, I'm not sure anything can be as funny as Blue-Jay from 'BatThumb'.Secondly...  Am I the only person who pre-oredered this and haven't received it yet?  What happened?  Didn't they make enough copies or what?I'll have to admit, I am a little disappointed in O-Entertainment for this blunder.  That is, if it's their fault. Who knows?I hope 'Frankenthumb' gets released soon.  I look forward to seeing it.",1034035200,,489,4.819277108433735
