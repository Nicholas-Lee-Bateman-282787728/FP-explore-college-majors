6201507,5,B00HRUQAKU,I hope that the first two episodes come out the way they were aired on TV not like paramount made,1396483200,,97,3.9
6201508,1,B00HRUQAKU,"Transformers Energon is a slow mess of going nowhere plot. Of all the series they have put out Energon is arguably the worst out there. The animation generally has nothing to do with it's quality. It features the Transformers in cel shaded CGI 99% of the time in traditionally animated backgrounds and human characters. Usually the blend isn't too bad if you don't mind the Transformers popping out colorfully. But the story it tries to tell is so incoherent.

It starts by following up on the last series ""Transformers: Armada"" with the Autobots and Decepticons at peace with one another after Megatrons time away. The Decepticons are a tad irked by being bossed around by their former enemies but tend to follow along. Since Armada they have built city like bases around the galaxy to mine for Energon, the usual Transformer fuel source. Rare to find but with their new Human ally Kicker have found a way to detect it. But the way they find it is hilariously bad. But a new faction comes into play trying to revive Unicron, the Terrorcons. Largely a race of animal themed transformer drones they come to steal the Energon from the Autobots and Decepticons. Eventually their leader at the time Alpha Q decides he needs a strong leader and brings Megatron back, Only for Megatron to usurp his position and take back leadership of the Decepticons as well.

Than after about the first 10 or so episode things just go bonkers with the plot going nowhere, back and forth incoherently looking for things, New transformers popping in usually just for advertising the new toy and not really any other reason in the long term. And a few characters get a strange personality quirk that got lost in the translation from the original Japanese version. I own the previous Paramount release so I can't tell you how well the DVD set from Shout Factory here really is. But as a series I would say unless your a hardcore Transformers fan willing to forgive bad storytelling I'd stay away from Energon unless you feel the need to be a completionist and fill the gap between ""Transformers: Armada"" and ""Transformers: Cybertron""",1395964800,6,2109,4.7753424657534245
6201509,2,B00HRUQAKU,"I'm a huge Transformers fan and have been one since they first came out way back in the mid 80s. I have loved every version of Transformers. All of them accept a few and they are all from around the same time era,and they also happen to be the ones that were not produced by Americans.
Robots in Disguise,
Armada,
Energon,
And Cybertron
I have watched these reboots and have tried to like them but it's just not happening. Don't get me wrong though,the animation is top notch but the stories and a lot of the voice acting I just can get past. For example the voice actor for Ironhide in Transformers Energon sounds like a surfer kid and anyone who really knows Transformers can hear that's just wrong. But even though I'm not crazy about Armada and Energon I'll be purchacing them for nostalgia and just so I can say I have them all. Hell I'll probably watch them to,at least once. But as far as I can tell they look like there pretty well put together. I'll see soon enough.",1392595200,2,975,4.362637362637362
6201510,3,B00HRUQAKU,"I just wonder if this could be the same one as the one that came out called the ultimate collection??
There was that set that came out already and will this be the whole Series or the same as the Ultimate Collection Edition
Other wise if not then this is a must have for any collector of Transformers,
Also is Shout a good Company
just a few things if posted after me i like to know.
Also if you do not like my posts do not say harmful things about them thank you
Well good luck Transformer Fans I wonder why it is put in a box like the Big TVs were,
I got this because i thought it was cool but if you have a new flat screen TV then forget it because it is sized for older TVs Not for Flatscreen TV
Good luck look into it
Also when you start it and goes to the menu it comes up wide and then go to an episode and it turns back to a box size",1389571200,3,841,3.7570621468926553

6201516,4,B00HRUQAKU,"My 10 year old son received as a gift and he loves it. I rememeber watching Transformers as a child, and prefer this ""old cartoon"" over the newer movies they have been putting out in the last few years.",1419292800,3,202,4.205128205128205
6201517,3,B00HRUQAKU,"Transformers: Energon is the second and in my opinion the weakest part of the Unicron Trilogy.

Set roughly 20 years after the end of ""Armada"" The Autobots and the Decepticons have an uneasy peace and are working in secret  with various world governments to mine Energon a powerful substance that can restore Cybertron. the damaged homeworld of the Transformers and give Earth a clean form of energy with the aid of the Omnicons (it's never stated but implied that Omnicons are the next stage of evolution for the Mini-Cons) who are the only Transformers that can touch and refine Energon into weapons and stars that power up the Autobots. Optimus Prime has granted the Autobots the Spark of Powerlinking which allows any two Autobots of the same size to link and become more powerful.

The only problem: Unicron also wants Energon so he can be restored and destroy Cybertron, Alpha Q a mysterious alien sends Scroponok and the Terrorcons (a trio of animal Transformers that do the Omnicons' jobs for the Decepticons and are basically cannon fodder) to attack Earth. When Scroponok uses Megatron's sword he convinces Cyclonus and Tidal Wave to join his side so they can bring Megatron Demolisher doesn't believe him, eventually Megatron does come back online and takes over and he does rejoin the Decepticons and Alpha Q is forced to retreat and revive Starscream and programs him to kill Megatron, This plan fails and Megatron restores Starscream's mind and the old gang is back. Over the course of the series the Decepticons get new bodies, paints jobs, and names. And both sides get new members.

The Autobots have a new human ally in teenager Kicker an extremely annoying whiney emo punk kid with daddy issues (and not entirely unjustified), who when he was a little boy he was hiding from Optimus Prime on Cybertron he falls into Primus' chamber and Primus not knowing what a human is gives the punk the power to detect Energon and he can also detect danger before hand. Kicker is teamed up with rookie Ironhide and two sort become a double act of annoying. Kicker's father is a brilliant and goofy sciencist who has dragged Kicker around the galaxy looking for Energon and put him into danger countless times believing that it would be a kid's greatest dream come true, and it's no wonder Kicker is such a whiney emo punk kid. His mother and younger sister are there but his mom is a wall flower and his sister is a brat. Rad, Carlos, and Alexis from ""Armada"" are also back, Rad helps Kicker's father. Alexis is a government offical.and Carlos heads a building a Martian colony. Kicker also wields the Star Saber from ""Armada"".

The Transformers are cel-shaded CGI with the humans and backgrounds being tradition cel animation and the effect doesn't work for the most part. The designs of the Transformers being so faithful to the toys just doesn't work. The voice acting is good except for Kicker and Ironhide they both are annoying. The first half of the series actually works for the most part. It's the second half that doesn't make any sense and ending is just plain weird.

This is not a bad series but in the end it's too messy and a lot of the Transformers' designs don't work in animation and cel shaded CGI doesn't work. The story of the second half of the series is hard to follow and feels like a bad rehash of the first half. Kicker and Ironhide are more annoying the ""G1"" Daniel and Wheelie, Unicron becomes nothing more than overgrown weapons factory for Megatron and Alpha Q to battle over with no personality.instead of the powerful evil god he's supposed to be.

I would only recommend this to hardcore Transformers fans. New and casual fans would be better served watching ""Transformers: Animated"" or ""Transformers: Prime"" instead.  . .  .",1409443200,4,3764,4.7607361963190185

8635106,4,B00HRUQAKU,a good transformers series to watch,1521849600,,35,5.0
8635107,1,B00HRUQAKU,"Not a worthwhile purchase. Serving as a sequel to Transformers Armada in both the English and Japanese versions, Energon suffers by having some of the worst animation for a Transformers cartoon, a story that is half filler, poor characters that destroys any development from Armada for returning cast, and the second worst human character in the franchise (though that list grows too quickly for my taste)

On the animation I am specifically referring to the 3-D animation which is stiff, clunky, and eats up show runtime with every transformation. The 2-D isn't that bad and on a handful of rare occasions when the plot calls for some real expressive emotions the 3-D will be replaced by 2-D, but these moments are brief and far between

If you ware such a massive Transformers fan that you have to have all of the media, fine. If not, then skip this one.

If you want to watch Transformers Cybertron you DO NOT need to watch this, despite the Unicron Trilogy claims. Cybertron was only made the 3rd installment of the Unicron trilogy as a marketing tool in the US. In truth Cybertron has no real connection between Armada and Energon",1512691200,,1135,4.751269035532995
