8764980,5,B01HD2SE82,The new 2k transfer in the 15th anniversary edition does make the movie look sliiiightly better. It also comes with all deleted scenes on a dvd I wasn't expecting!,1473292800,2,163,4.655172413793103
8764981,1,B01HD2SE82,"Did not even wsnt to give this a Star but had to in order to warn you.  It is the exact same Donnie Dark movie that had been or for years. It just has a new looking case.  It's a movie snake, which means that people speed buying it because it's old so the add a few changes to the cover to make it look like it has more scenes and more unseen footage but it's nothing new they just want to stay getting people to buy them again so they make more money on it. I have family that work in the movie business doing lighting and building sets, they told me that this is all just A Hollywood scam to get richer. DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY ON THIS, PLEASE!",1470096000,12,646,3.8863636363636362
