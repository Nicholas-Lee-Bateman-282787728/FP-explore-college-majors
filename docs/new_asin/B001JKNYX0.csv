Kaspar shows you exercises and fills to put into your rhythms and leads you right into rhythms using those fills. I would have liked the play to be longer so I could catch up however, replaying the same part over a few times does the trick.",1358294400,,390,4.507042253521127
8313019,5,B001JKNYX0,"I have been using his first DVD to learn the basics and I love it. Souhail focuses on teaching sound fundamentals for playing a doumbek.

This is the intermediate lesson but I think there is an even better description of the basic techniques.

The main goal of this DVD is to teach additional techniques and rhythms. Both of his DVDs are easy to follow and he takes the time to teach the proper way to play a doumbek.

If you really want to learn to play a doumbek then you need both of these DVDs and practice, practice, practice.

Note: After using this DVD and DVD's by Karim Nagi and Amir Naoum I have to down grade my rating to 4 stars. I like the way Souhail teaches but I find it difficult to pick up some of the rhythms the way Souhail presents them. Karim talks through each rhythm using ka to differentiate between left and right hand teks. Amir has the rhythm notation on the DVD.",1232841600,9,891,4.285714285714286
