811239,5,6304208219,"If you have seen the tv show from Japan or video of the series. It has been improved by Jet Li. They used the story of Lone Wolf and Cub, but made improvements. Fight scenes are far better, story is fine (revenge is always  good for fighting) and some added humor from the supporting cast.",915321600,,289,4.254545454545455

So Tai Seng is releasing widescreen laser disc masters again? Niiicccee. Wait for a better release. At least that one might not have a Ric Meyers commentary on there.

811317,3,6304208219,"This is not a bad flick and there are 2 or 3 fight scenes worth watching again - but Jet Li's stoic performance is overshadowed by unrealistic wire stunts and silly gimics.  Surprisingly, I was not annoyed by the young kung fu kid in this one (I'm almost always annoyed by these ""cutsey"" kid kung fu interludes)... it was actually rather amusing - but (yes another but), the villian just wasn't good enough, and that's always a downer.  The villian rides around in some metalic shiney future mobile that is so dumb it surpasses absurd insanity and falls into the ""what the hell was this movie about anyways.""?  Still can't figure out what the director was thinking.",1154908800,,665,4.666666666666667
811318,4,6304208219,"offers enough novel action and cute humor to satisfy. For us guys, the female thief is cute, sexy, funny. Standout scene for me is when Jet, as a bodyguard, is courted by her when she tries to measure him up for some badly needed new clothing. The kid also deserves mention: evidently this kid is the real deal and his fight with other kids is a somewhat rare sight. Fight scenes are more stylised than actual but they are choreographed with style. Toward the end there is a big surprise when the vile baddie shows up. He is really different and nasty as hell. You won't believe what he has and Jet has a real challenge to beat him. Overall, should please anyone who likes the feudal period.",1141171200,3,691,4.40625
811319,1,6304208219,"I tried to watch this film again, but it's still bad.
Well, lets see.... where does the madness begin!? Well first I have to say that I bought this movie way back when Fist of Legend first came out in 1994.(Which was a great film.)

By the looks of the cover, I thought this would be a good film, but this one was garbage. I am a HUGE Jet Li fan, he is one of the most talented martial artists to date, but the movie was awfull. First I do not like all the flying around stuff,so that turned me off, but I can deal with it. The fights scenes were too unrealistic, and the Villian had a metal car!?? Yes a METAL CAR!..Man..What is that about!!? That was so cheesy. The movie was More like a fantasy cartoon, that I couldn't wait to end. The movie was Very disapointing! The film has the same kid in it as in ""My Father is a Hero"" and is very similar to Fung Sai Yuk. Sai Yuk was much, much better. This one is as bad as ""Kung Fu Cult Master"". no, Actually that movie was better. This one was pretty bad.",1080777600,5,1002,4.01

811321,5,6304208219,"This movie was astonishing.  I laughed until it hurt at several points while watching it, the result of awful subtitles (obviously never reviewed by an english speaker) translating bizarre dialogue.  For me, the plot and action were subsumed by the humor-intentional and not-of most scenes.  This movie must be seen to be believed.",1043020800,2,331,5.2075471698113205
811322,4,6304208219,"Kwun( Jet Li) finds his family and friends dead when he comes back to his village.

811323,5,6304208219,"This is one of my favoret Jet Li movies although not his best this movie is worthy of your collection. You can watch it over and over agen like I have. I'ts funny, action packed, and based on a real person (Hung Hei Guen)named after him is The Hung style of kung Fu, or Hung Gar and his son was named Hung Man Ting. Man Ting along with Luk Ah Choy carried on the tradition from master to student to Wong Tai, to Wong Kay Ying and his famous son, Wong Fei Hung. You can put this movie along side of your historical Masters movies like Once upon a time in China. I defenetly recomend this Kung Fu Packed movie to buy.",1023667200,,615,4.049180327868853
811354,2,6304208219,"Having read all of the positive reviews on this film, I decided to purchase it since I am a huge Jet Li fan.  The movie started out great and it seemed I had a true classic on my hands but as time wore on I realized what a [bad movie this was].  The story is incredibly weak and goes in a totally opposite direction than what you'd expect, favoring badly done humor instead of throwing in some sorely needed combat sequences.  The fight scenes themselves are well done half the time and boring the other half.  If you're a fan of Jet and want to see a well done collaboration between him and Wong Jing, check out Deadly China Hero or Lord of the Wu Tang.",1019952000,,654,4.166666666666667
811355,4,6304208219,New legend of Shaolin. I usually don't like the newer martial arts movies(too much wirework & flaming yellow orbs & stuff). I'm into the old school classics (see Listmania). But a friend recommended this one to me & I went out & bought it. I was not disappointed. Jet Li has a Major Obstacle in this one in the way of a demon from hell re-incarnated to destroy him. Good special effects. Wirework was not that bad. The little kid steals the show though. He styles & poses just like Jet Li. He also kicks some major xxx. New school high impact action.,1019865600,,550,4.349514563106796
811356,4,6304208219,"Not much needs to be said about this man that hasn't already been said.  He's straight up nasty!  I recommend you purchase this movie before Disney buys it, edits it and changes the music score like many of his other movies.",1017360000,,224,4.439024390243903
811357,5,6304208219,"Jet plays Hung Xi Guan (I believe he's historically the brother of Wong Fei Hung) and Tze Miu plays his son Man Ting in a great story about survival. Hung Xi Guan is wanted by Imperial troops for his rebellion and he and his son is on the run. Many years earlier, a former friend of Hung backstabbed him and joined the troops. Hung had to fight and kill him to survive, but he did't die. Instead he came survived and became this ""poisonous man"" who is now running the troops. The Imperial troops are also also killing innocents to fight a group of kids that have a certain treasure map tattooed on their backs. You won't see Jet using his fists too much in this movie for he is using a special kind of spear throughout and its pretty cool. His son however played by Tze Mui is pretty awesome in this movie. This boy got some real kung fu skills and he really shines here. The ever so beautiful Chingmy Yau is also in this film. There are plenty of fights in this movie to keep kung fu buffs happy and they are all well choreographed. The story is quite touching for its time as well, and the humor is definitely present. One thing I didn't like about the film is the ""poisonous man"" riding around in a metal car...watch it and you'll see, its really weird. Now, I've read that a US release will be coming out under the name The Legend of the Red Dragon...hmm...as far as I can remember, this has very little to do with any dragon, let alone it being red...I believe this film will only have an English dub, and you know how nasty that can get. Folks, stick with the original because I'm down right sure that a lot of the original comedy and feel to the film will be cut out of the new rerelease. Now, there are 2 HK versions, one being from Tai Seng and the newly released and remastered Universe version...get the Universe one cause the picture and sound is far better than Tai Seng. Of course the US release will probably have the best sound effects, but the Universe release is loud enough. If you buy any American rerelease that is only English dubbed, just make sure you got the original too....Trust me, it'll start to bother you after a while. Anyways, this film is great, and well worth your viewing. ...",1011312000,5,2212,4.319711538461538
811358,5,6304208219,"I really enjoyed this movie!  It combines the political intrique of Swordsman II with the comedic elements of Fong Sai Yuk (which also had a political underpinning).  This is a fantasy style movie with plenty of wirework and unlikely physics.  If you like that style of movie, then you should love this one!
Jet Li (Hung) and his son Man Ting are on the run from government soldiers.  Jet Li has plenty of good (and serious!) advice for his son, like ""show no mercy"" and ""don't lose your temper, but if you do, then lose it"".  In a way, Jet Li and his son are playing the straight men in this movie.
Red Bean and her mother are infamous thieves who trick foolish men out of their fortunes.  It turns out that they are kung fu artists of considerable skill too (no match for Jet Li of course, but who is?).  They target Mr Ma, who has just hired Jet Li to protect him.  These two provide a lot of the comic relief.  Mother Red Bean reminds me a lot of Fong Sai Yuk's mother.
The villians are the evil government soldiers (who die by the hundred), an evil eunuch (of course), and someone from Jet Li's past who has turned himself into a Poisonous Man and drives around in what looks like a metal rat-car!
Anyway, the movie was very funny.  The fight scenes were well done and impressive, as were the special effects.  Definately a high quality movie.
The video quality was pretty good.  It is widescreen, but not anamorphic.  The movie has either Cantonese or Mandarin soundtracks, with English subtitles.  The subtitles are in the movie however (as opposed to a separate subtitle track on the DVD) and are sometimes hard to read.",1008460800,18,1628,4.456081081081081
811359,4,6304208219,"This is a great film. The baddie overdoes his part a bit, but seeing Jet Li play an absolutely angry individual is a wonderful surprise. He and Tse Mui, who play his son, are absolutely unbelievable martial artists. Mui steals some scenes, but never entirely, making you want to watch both of them and what they'll do next. Great film....",998784000,2,338,4.65
811360,5,6304208219,"Kung-fu artist, Jet Li, is well known for his ""Once Upon A Time In China"" series, in which he plays legendary character Wong Fei-Hung. Few people know that Wong Fei-Hung used a kung-fu style that derived from another legendary character, Hong Hei-Kwun. Jet Li portrays Hong Hei-Kwun in ""New Legend of Shaolin.""
World-known Corey Yuen adds to his impressive list by directing (along with Jing Wong) and choreographing for ""New Legend of Shaolin""'s kung-fu sequences. Among Corey Yuen/Yuen Kwai's other works are ""Fong Sai Yuk 1&2"", ""Lethal Weapon 4"", ""Romeo Must Die"", ""Kiss of the Dragon"", ""Warriors of the Magic Mountain"", as well as ""My Father Is A Hero.""
Hung Hei-Kwun (Jet Li), and his son, Hung Man-Ting (Miu Tse, who also played Jet's son in ""My Father Is A Hero"") work together against a corrupt government that has killed their family and Shaolin Temple brothers.
The plot is well-developed in most aspects, for a series of small plots are weaved together beautifully to make a rather successful outcome.
Jet Li and Miu Tse both give some of the best performances in their careers to the screen. To heighten their performances, supporting actors/actresses including Chingmy Yau and Lung Wei Wang bring the film comical effects and seven stunning kung-fu sequences that are packed with wirework, impressive performances by Miu Tse (acting as Jet's son), and some of Jet's most notable moves. With a creative choreographer, Corey Yuen, kung-fu scenes in this kicking film are unpredictably shocking. Jet Li and Miu Tse's collaboration are both touching and electrifying. To heighten kung-fu performances, sound effects, cinematography, choreography, sets, dialogue, and costume designs practically define perfection.
""New Legend of Shaolin"" is one of Jet Li's most breathtaking performances when it comes to his kung-fu scenes. This is a must-see.",994464000,6,1853,5.263513513513513
811361,4,6304208219,"Ok, first of all, I didn't like the evil guy in his little silver car. This movie could have been very good, but something about it didn't make it as good as it should have been. Don't get me wrong, I like this movie a lot, I've never seen Jet Li look as sexy as he does in this movie! And Xie Maio is such a talented litle martial artist! When, him and Jet Li fight together, all I can say is, wow. If you liked The Kung Fu Master (I Loooooooved it) I think you'll apreciate this one, because they both have a similar fantasy element to it. All and all I like this movie, watch it if you like Jet Li.",989625600,3,601,3.894308943089431
811362,5,6304208219,"This is an excellent movie and one of my favorites from Jet Li.  My other all-time favorites are Fist of Legend (original version, not the ""Americanized"" DVD) and Kung Fu Cult Master.  For all serious Jet Li fans of the classic Chinese era, this one is a must!",988243200,2,260,4.395833333333333
811363,4,6304208219,"This movie is not a masterpiece, but it is a good guilty pleasure.  I like seeing a half-rotten man driving in a little car that looks like it was made from tin foil.  Actually this movie is pretty good.  Jet Li fights mainly with a spear that seems to do everything possible.  The kids fight and look really cute.  And yes, even the rotting man and his car have a strange appeal.  What you should know about this disk is that it was obviously taken from a VHS copy and put onto DVD.  The video quality is pretty bad.  But really the worst part is the subtitles.  There are hard subtitles that cannot be removed.  In addition there are Chinese subtitles also on the screen.  IF you are used to the VHS Jet Li movies you also know of the other problems with this:  they are really small and tend to go off the edge of the screen.  But if you are used to Jet Li movies, you can deal with these errors.  I just with the publisher used the advantages of the DVD format more.",982022400,2,970,4.145161290322581

7865165,5,6304208219,"This movie was made 20 years ago when Jet Li was still young, probably at his physical peak. It's a fun kung fu film about a man revenging for the slayings of his family and friends. The little kid who plays his son can do a few showy kicks, and there're some funny moments between father and son. The action sequences are nonstop. Even though they're truly over-the-top, more so than many other kung fu flicks, they're fun to watch, as long as you don't take things seriously. I'm no kung fu film lover, but my kids love this film and have watched it over a dozen times. I like it, too.

That said, the DVD I ordered from seller dealcatcher2014 appears to be a bootlegged copy. It's an English dubbed version, with no subtitles, even though my media player reports the presence of a Japanese subtitles track but it's not visible! The back of the jewel case mixes English with Chinese and then gives the specs in Japanese! Video quality is quite poor, reminiscent of VCD quality. The English dub is okay but sound quality is poor.

This is an outdated, hokey, slipshod, wonderfully funny and marvelously amusing little film! It looks even older than it is (1994), but is never boring, alm ost non-stop, and I can't recall a single momenty that was not amusing or setting up a funny scene.

The ""old lady"" (mother) seems like a reall trooper and is just wild to watch and enjoy at teimes, especailly as the film progresses.

Sure, a lot is lost in the translation (culture), and some Chinesie stuff is not funny to western eyes, but it's still okay. Also, this is the only Asian film I've ever seen that uses ""bawdy,"" vaudevillian type, ""locker-room"" room humor, and it's crude, yes, but delightful. At least theres no pee or poo or racial or gay trashing like you would get from today's ""modern comedians.""

The English sub-titles are awful, funny in themselves they are so bad, but they are decipherable.

This is a funny, absorbing, amusing , instructional film (movie-wise). I gave it 5 stars because it was unique in my experience, and all I watch is mostly Asian, Hindi, and French or other ""foreign"" films.

See it! :)

The video quality is poor and subtitles are burnt on. I then did research and ordered the universe copy of new legend of shaolin which is decent with removable subtitles. However I was always curious about the tai-seng 2006 copy listed on this site. I could never find any one commenting on picture quality etc of this edition so i finally broke down and bought it even though i had the universal copy. The 2006 tai seng copy listed on amazon has removable subtitles good picture quality and a really good commentary. So pay a couple extra dollars to get the tai seng 2006 release as opposed to the 2001 release and you will be glad you did.,1317945600,2,814,4.397350993377484
