3885067,4,B002AL2TYW,"This is a wonderful holiday movie. Shot on location in Vermont, it takes me back home (Born and raised Vermonter). Love the premise...love the characters. You will laugh, maybe even cry a little.

In any case, I definetly recommend Moonlight & Mistletoe to anyone looking for a feel-good holiday movie.",1260144000,10,302,5.04

3885069,5,B002AL2TYW,"My wife and I previously watched this movie on the Hallmark Channel and decided that we needed a DVD to watch it whenever we so desired.

This was the first DVD we have had the time to watch of the 6 that we purechased.  It is a great DVD to enjoy, the one we purchased has a couple of flaws in the DVD near the beginning.  It is not a perfect DVD.",1258761600,8,348,3.8055555555555554
3885070,4,B002AL2TYW,"ABC Family usually puts out some pretty good Christmas movies and this one is no exception. I call it ""cheestastic"" because it is predictable but the story is fun nonetheless. My biggest problem with the movie was the actors. I am a fan of Candace Cameron-Bure from her days on Full House, but she almost doesn't look like the same person in this movie. She appears to have had quite a bit of plastic surgery, as you will notice because her face never moves. There is a part where she is clearly supposed to scowl/give a dirty look to the villain of the movie and when she turns to do this, her eyes give a cold stare but the rest of her face doesn't follow. I found her lack of emotional responses to be quite amusing, which I think detracted from the story.

The story is very cute, following a bit along the lines of a Charlie Brown Christmas. CCB's father runs a ""resort"" if you will in a small town in Vermont (look for the sign on the wall in Santa's Workshop) called ""Santaville"" that runs 365 days a year. When CCB is younger, business is booming as people still enjoy the magic of Christmas and kids are still asking for things like ponies and dollhouses instead of X-box 360s and Guitar Hero. However, as Charlie Brown says, Christmas becomes too commerical and the business in Santaville dries up. CCB's father, played by Tom Arnold (who lacks the usual no-nonsense abrasiveness I loved about him in True Lies) has been neglecting his bills due to lack of income waiting for a Christmas miracle. CCB returns to the town very reluctantly after her father is injured in a sleighing accident. She has become the cynical Scrooge figure one might expect after having her entire childhood swirled around 24/7/365 Christmas. There is the usual romantic faire and the predictable evil villian who swoops in to try to take Santaville from the family but it has the Christmas happy ending everyone cherishes (and I would have been royally angry if it didn't).

I can't say this is a Christmas film I will be watching every year, but I am not sorry I added it to my library. It is an enjoyable movie suitable for families with a refreshing course on the true meaning of Christmas. Money well spent.",1257638400,36,2198,4.547979797979798
3885071,5,B002AL2TYW,"This is a great family film-heard one bad word,,but other than that it is wonderful and it will become a must see film each year. It has alot of good morals in it about family and love. You should see this with your family. We thought the acting was great and we will  hope for more films like it.",1257552000,21,297,4.033898305084746
3885072,4,B002AL2TYW,"This is hardly the best Christmas movie I've ever seen. There were some horribly awkward parts that will always bug me (the two kids who played the younger versions of CC-B's & CW's characters were painfully bad actors). And yeah, the nutcrackers were a hard sell, but over all it had what most people look for in a Christmas movie, and that is Christmas. It had a quiet charm that I found endearing and over all I enjoyed it.",1254700800,9,426,4.405063291139241
3885073,2,B002AL2TYW,"My apologies to Candace Cameron-Bure, because I really like her, but this movie just didn't cut it.
Candace plays a young woman who grew up as her father's (Tom Arnold) right-hand man in ""Santaville"". He was Santa and she was his elf. She couldn't even call him ""dad"" because Santa doesn't have children, just elves.
Later, as a workaholic adult, she takes a break from her job in the city and returns home when her dad gets in an accident and needs help. She finds Santaville in deep financial trouble and her dad in denial over the whole thing.
Thinking she is helping her dad keep Santaville, she signs a contract with a slimy character who is so obvious in his sinister role that if he had a moustache you would expect him to start twirling the ends of it. She has actually just sold out to developers.
*Spoiler Alert*
The knight in shining armor in all of this is a quiet young man working for her dad--someone she had met briefly  years ago, but has now forgotten.  He all but works for free, since there isn't enough money to go around and he seems to get by. He spends his spare time puttering in the workshop. Just when things look their darkest, his supposedly amazing handmade nutcrackers come to the rescue, selling  for hundreds and thousands of dollars--saving Santaville and putting it back on the map. It is hard for me to believe that the people who put this together actually thought the items they used to represent his amazing nutcrackers would even pass as nutcrackers, let alone amazing enough to sell for the sums they claim. Other family members who viewed this felt the same way.
I really wanted to like this movie because I liked the main characters, but the acting wasn't always up to par and when they started having everyone go crazy over these wooden dolls that could have been made in junior high shop class, that was the last straw. Was there no one on the set who could say, ""These aren't that amazing and they aren't even nutcrackers""?
I don't expect Christmas movies to be realistic--after all, we are talking about Christmas time when magic is in the air, but I do expect some measure of believability within the ""Christmas"" framework. If that is not critical to you and you just want another Christmas movie to add to your collection, this one at least will probably not offend you with anything inappropriate. Your whole family can watch it together, but once may be enough.",1254528000,10,2412,4.591647331786543
3885094,3,B002AL2TYW,What can say about this movie. I love it very much. But the dvd had a few glitches in it was afraid to ask for another one. Other than that the movie was fine. It still played on the player. I give it 3 stars.,1515369600,,209,3.6666666666666665

3885096,4,B002AL2TYW,"I love LOVE this movie but... beware that the DVDs being sold here produced by Gaiam Entertainment unfortunately (and inexcuseably in this day and age) contain small but still jarring and annoying instances of flickers/flaws/glitches/audio/video dropouts during one scene at the beginning of the movie as if it was recorded from a TV that had a bad cable box connection.  This should never happen with officially licensed DVDs.  How quality control missed this (you can't NOT notice the flaws when they happen) is beyond me.  I've ordered 2 copies of this DVD now (the full screen and the letterbox version) and both had the exact same problems in the exact same spots so it's not a matter of a bad disc but flawed source material.  The glitches happen when the long haired teenage version of Peter walks into Santa's store at the beginning of the film.  The flickering glitches there are almost on par with the flaws seen on old VHS tapes when the tape got chewed up.  It's doesn't happen for long but it happens and perfectionists and even nonperfectionists will go, ""what the..?""  LOVE the movie, but very disappointed that it contains those audio/video dropouts no matter how small they are since the movie's not exactly ancient and I'm sure there is a better source print available for a DVD do-over.  Still, this IS nitpicking (justified nitpicking) for those who expect better from today's DVDs, but to be fair, once you get past that initial part, the rest of the movie seems to play without hitch, letting you escape into the movie world again without other instances that wake you from your cinema stupor.  The movie itself is a heartwarming tearjerker and a must-see for fans of Candace Cameron Bure and Hallmark Christmas movies.  She and Tom Arnold make a great daughter/father duo.  Highly recommended movie despite the DVD having those annoying hiccups at the beginning.  Not sure if Gaiam Entertainment can be contacted to correct this, but they owe it to buyers to do so.",1513987200,2,1988,4.849112426035503

3885232,3,B002AL2TYW,"This movie follows a fairly standard Christmas movie plot in which a widowed dad is down on his luck but has some help at Christmas. This movie is set in a New England town where the dad has been running a Christmas theme park for years. The park is in trouble because people aren't interested in traditional Christmas things anymore and prefer technology. The daughter went off to college after being sick of 24/7 Christmases as a kid working at the park. When she comes home to help her dad, she finds out about the financial situation and hatches a plan to save the place. There is a romantic subplot between the daughter and a park employee who had met her when she was younger. In the end the park is saved though someone what of a twist that isn't terribly surprising. The movie has some interesting characters but the plot isn't terribly innovative. The setting is interesting but a bit unbelievable. It's also kind of odd how the attendance at the park has dropped so precariously but then rises miraculously without much more than some creative advertising. If you like Christmas movies, this one is pretty decent albeit a little hard to believe here and there.",1449273600,5,1170,4.657004830917875

The romantic leads don't posess any real chemistry between them, so the lovely romantic title is a bit too much for the story.  All this is torrerable for a cut rate movie, but the real problem for me is the writing. The time line is all over the place. We open a Christmas time movie in the busy Christmas Season. OK ..  All the hustle and bustle indicates it's Christmas Week, deadlines loom! Then half way thru the movie, after at least another week has passed we are told "" the office is closing down for Christmas - don't bother to come in, there's nobody here"".  After a few more days pass by it is now STILL 3 weeks UNTIL Christmas. Then after only a short couple of days, it's Christmas Eve.. There are a few other obvious misses in the continuity as well. They get more visible as the climax draws near. IF YOU DONT MIND SOME UNINTENDED TIME WARPING AND INACCURACY IN COUNTING THINGS LIKE DAYS, WEEKS AND THE QUANTITY IN THE  NUMBER FORTY, YOU MIGHT ENJOY IT.",1437868800,3,1201,4.465753424657534

3885337,5,B002AL2TYW,"In an uncertain world sometimes it is nice to have a little predictability. In this movie you are guaranteed a happy ending even though you are not sure it will really happen. The suspense holds your attention from start to finish. And who is going to get the girl? Santa's daughter seems to have two interests at first. Can she decide who she really loves? So this movie has romance and lots of snow. This is not really a kid's movie although it has lots of kids visiting Santaville. It is more for adults who have a romantic heart and believe in hope and a better future.

3885341,3,B002AL2TYW,"A woman (Candace Cameron Bure), saddled with a festive name (Holly) and a holiday loving father (Tom Arnold), turns into a Grinch of sorts, having had her fill of Christmas 24/7 from childhood until she made good her escape from Santaville.  Now a grim adult with no room in her life for any ho-ho-ho, she finds herself pulled back to Santaville due to a sleighing accident that injured her single-minded father.  She arrives back in her hometown slightly hostile, cold, nasty, and more than a little unpleasant.  This is a testament to her father who preferred treating her like an employee/elf rather than a daughter.  In short order, she learns that her father and Santaville are in dire financial straits.  To complicate matters, she trusts the wrong person and they end up with an even bigger mess to fix.  Yes, there is a romance of sorts included but you have to dig for it.  It's more of an added benefit rather than the main focal point of this movie.

This is not the jolliest Christmas movie I've ever watched.  And as far as romances go, it doesn't.  And someone involved needed to better research what real nutcrackers look like as opposed to turned-spindles painted to look like dolls.

3885406,5,B002AL2TYW,"Just because a movie is a little predictable, doesn't make it a bad movie.  This was a cute Christmas film about a girl that almost got suckered into selling her Dad's Christmas business by a guy pretending to care for her.  In the end, she found out the guys plans before he could succeed, and true love wins out.",1388448000,,314,4.305084745762712
3885407,4,B002AL2TYW,"It's another holiday movie that goes from ""Oh, crap, Christmas is ruined!"" to ""This is the best Christmas ever!"" But if it hadn't it would've been Tom Arnold's fault. He plays Nick Crosby, the local Santa. In quaint Chester, Vermont, Nick operates a year-round Christmas theme park called Santaville. It's a family business that dates back to when Nick's daughter, Holly, was a kid.

I guess it makes sense that Holly, from when she was very young, would resent Santaville. Recruited from jump to work as Nick's primary elf at the Santaville gift shop, Holly's had to pace herself with the whole Christmas spirit thing. The movie opens and soon enough cuts to her early teen self in that gift shop, manning the cash register and smiling big and giving with the parting remark: ""And we hope to see you soon again in Santaville where every day is Christmas."" And note that Santaville is open 365 days a year. That's a lot of smiling big.

The camera cuts to fifteen years later, relocates from quaint Chester to bustling Boston. And there's Holly (Candace Cameron-Bure) all grown-up. She's a Boston sales manager now, and, in keeping with that age-old holiday movie tradition, she's a workaholic and loathes Christmas. Her boss has to bully her into taking a vacay. For the past three years she's rejected her widower dad's invite to spend the holidays at home. It takes a freak sleigh ride accident that cracks Nick's leg for Holly to go back to Chester and back to Santaville.

Back home, it's not until Holly notices that stack of unpaid bills that she susses out something's wrong. Not only is her dad in a pickle, he's also in a jam. See, Nick Crosby has never had a head for business. Once a thriving Yuletide attraction, Santaville is in everyone's rear view mirror. Hardly anyone visits anymore. Today, the children have too many other things to distract them. Chester's a struggling town, and the local bank is reluctant to extend Nick a line of credit. It boils down to this: the Crosbys have to come up with $50,000 by Christmas eve or they lose Santaville. Here's Holly, prodigal daughter come back to the fold, making it her mission to save the family business. Her arsenal: savvy marketing, an old friend's whittling skills, and a group of mysterious investors (two out of these three will end up working). She embarks on what she calls a remember campaign and blogs away, blogs away, targeting the Chester community's bump of nostalgia. And just maybe, somewhere along the doing of this, Holly Crosby can patch up her beef with her dad and rediscover the true meaning of Christmas.

It's been a bit since Full House, and ""DJ Tanner"" is all grown up now. Candace Cameron-Bure has carved out a modest niche in Christmas cinema (The Heart of Christmas, Let It Snow). She's pretty good in Moonlight & Mistletoe (2008), a fun holiday flick that's low in surprises but generous in its ability to make you feel warm and fuzzy when watching it. It's interesting to see Tom Arnold tone down his acerbic sarcasm. He's really okay as the in-over-his-head dad who keeps on expecting some miracle to bail out the floundering family business. One of the film's sweetest moments is when Nick tells his daughter the origin of the family phrase ""moonlight and mistletoe."" And maybe this is a minor spoiler but I kept suspecting that guy Peter (Christopher Wiehl) of being more than what he presented himself as, which was this humble woodcarver with a knack for turning out these exquisite nutcracker soldiers. Oh, well, in a way, it's neat that this fairly predictable narrative was able to confound me some.

By the way, if you're contemplating purchasing this DVD, let me instead direct you to this DVD set:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Holiday-Triple-Feature-The-Most-Wonderful-Time-of-the-Year-Moonlight-Mistletoe-The-Christmas-Choir/dp/B0055HK6UW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Holiday Triple Feature: The Most Wonderful Time of the Year/ Moonlight & Mistletoe/ The Christmas Choir</a>.

It certainly couldn't have been the one starring Tom Arnold and DJ from Full House.

This is hands down the worst Christmas movie ever made, and for that reason has become a family favorite, viewed religiously year after year, so maybe the creators are smarter than I think.

Estranged daughter Holly (Candace Cameron Bure) who has lost all Christmas spirit returns home to help her father who was injured and can't run the park from his wheelchair. This movie has all the human elements of new found love in the form of (Christopher Wiehl). This movie contains happiness, warmth, trust, and betrayal.  Although I have to say predictable, it's still an enjoyable movie. I don't know that it's one you would want to see more than once, so I would suggest renting it first.

3885507,5,B002AL2TYW,This movie shows the need for family and what can be accomplished as a family.  definately a family movie.  A seasonal movie that can be watched year round.,1328227200,,156,4.535714285714286
3885508,5,B002AL2TYW,I don't care for Tom Arnold as a general rule but this movie is one of two exceptions. I do like Candice Cameron from her Full House days and she sure has grown up inclding getting married to become Candice Cameron-Bure. But lets get to the movie. The plot was good. Tom Arnolds chactor is a workaholic and to into cChristmas. Consenquently when his daughter Candice Camerons chactor grows up she is also a workaholic but not that into Christmas. Until a family crisis calls her back home where she is reunited with a guy she technily only met once who turns out to be her soulmate. Its up to them to save Christmas and its a very good movie. Merry Christmas.,1328227200,,659,4.409836065573771
3885509,5,B002AL2TYW,It's becoming one of my holiday favorites.  It's only been around for a couple of years. It shows how a father and daughter can repair their relationship when it's about something they both love.,1324771200,4,195,4.735294117647059
3885510,5,B002AL2TYW,Ive written a review on this movie. I loved this movie. Im glad to share this movie with my friends and family. I ordered another one for my cousin. Im hoping she will love it as much as I do.,1324252800,,192,3.825
3885511,5,B002AL2TYW,"Just heard of this this year and enjoyed watching it.  I loved Candance Cameron-Bure from Full House and enjoy watching her as an adult.  I don't particularly like Tom Arnold, but he was good in this.  Nice little feel good Christmas movie by Hallmark, so it is pretty safe to show anyone, young and old.  Good safe movie to play with relatives in the house and you don't have to be afraid what kids will see or hear that's inappropriate.  Glad I found this, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Most-Wonderful-Time-of-the-Year/dp/B002AL2TYC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Most Wonderful Time of the Year</a>&nbsp;this year.

3885512,5,B002AL2TYW,"Tom Arnold, Candace Cameron-Bure, and Christopher Wiehl are all excellent in this charming Christmas story about a year-round Christmas theme park about to be closed forever.  The three come together and at the last possible moment pull off the impossible and save the beloved village known as Santaville.  Candace Cameron-Bure is excellent as the estranged daughter of park owner Tom Arnold, who has mismanaged the business to the brink of bankruptcy.  Christopher Wiehl is the talented artist/woodcarver who has been helping maintain the park.  Love and family pride rule the day in this instant Christmas classic.  It is a feel-good movie that one can watch at any time throughout the year to make oneself feel better.  I highly recommend this movie.",1319500800,,753,5.181818181818182

I discovered this movie in a search for something to watch. In the end I purchased a two pack, Moonlight & Mistletoe and The Most Wonderful Time of the Year. The Most Wonderful Time of the Year I could have done without. The acting of the heroine was poorly done, though with another actress could have been a good movie.

Moonlight & Mistletoe on the other hand was a wonderful movie. Great acting. Great storyline. It was a cute story done well that will warm your heart and having you smiling. The romance was subtle and of so sweet.",1293926400,,560,4.480392156862745
3885526,4,B002AL2TYW,"When the mood strikes, I can require Christmas any time of year! Moonlight and Mistletoe is perfect for just those moments, because as obvious as the plot twists are -- there's a great deal here to renew your spirits and belief in happy times ahead. In a rough economy when so many people are feeling the economic pinch, we can relate to this enjoyable story of a Christmas wonderland that has fallen on hard times.

Can Santaland be saved by the hard-nosed businesswoman, her father's dreams of renewal... and what about the dastardly villain looking to gain control by any trickery possible? There's even a little romance thrown in for good measure!

Moonlight and Mistletoe has just enough going for it to make it a worthy addition to your DVD collection.",1285977600,3,758,4.778625954198473

8359674,1,B002AL2TYW,"Really bad writing, directing and a stupid storyline.  Santaville was tacky; the fabulous nutcrackers that saved the place were junky looking.  The main romantic lead- the daughter was super grumpy all the time.  The male romantic lead was always cringing away from the grumpy girl.  There was not any chemistry.  The father acted like an idiot; he was always staring like a lunatic with a goofy smile waving his hands all over.  The villains that wanted to take over the place were ski resort developers.  A ski resort would have been a much more attractive background than a super commercialized Santa village with spoiled bratty kids asking for tons of material goods.  The daughter seemed super angry because her father was like a kid who ""won't grow up""--like Peter Pan, so she had to be the adult all her life and never got a chance to be a child.  The male romantic character had a pathetic backstory that made him seem really nerdy.  He met her once and was enthralled with her off-the-cuff grumpy comment about ""The Nutcracker Suite"" and how it is so a part of Christmas.  I think that story is creepy.  It's overrated.  If you take Jesus's birth out of Christmas it is nothing more than a sales gimmick.  Who can get teary eyed about that?  I had to skip over a lot of this-- it was painful.",1520121600,,1301,4.571428571428571
