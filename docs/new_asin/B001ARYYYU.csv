I have tried 3 different distributers to get this. Previous 2 returned my payment. Tried to find out why but still to recieve a reply. So Why The Review. I don't even expect a reply to this ""review"" either.
On the whole I have been very happy with Amazon and the usual very good delivery. BUT, a couple of times I have had this type of non-commital reply. If a company does return payment, PLEASE give reason WHY !!",1241222400,,456,4.193181818181818
