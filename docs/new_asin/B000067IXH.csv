Even as good as Cassavetes is, he can't redeem a really horrible script, and I don't mean so horrible its funny kind of ""horrible""... this is just not entertaining, not scarey, and just a plain waste  of time.

This film thoroughly deserves  any and every negative comment about it. Do not waste your time, even if you like straight splatter films, this film is just a waste of time.",1106611200,3,616,4.321739130434783

1715480,4,B000067IXH,"I just finished watching this movie on DVD and I simply don't understand why it has such so-so reviews. Cassavetes gives a fine performance(as usual), it's violent and gory, and the ending is nice and twisted. I miss horror films like this and wish more were made. Too many folks now have been spoonfed junk by the likes of Wes Craven and company for over the past 15 years, which has unfortunately caused some movie goers to expect flash, dumb characters, stupid stories and highly marketable villians. Of course I'm not saying that this film is high art or anything but it is highly creepy, has some nice camera work, good performances, and doesn't treat the audience like they were a four year old.

1715530,4,B000067IXH,Cassavetes!  The Incubus is more of a low-brow slasher deviation than the supernatural mystery that it strains to be. It really rolls around in the muck of its sexual assault subject matter that probably played more dramatically when it was released than it does today. Today it reads more like an Eli Roth schlock screed than anything serious minded. But it does have Cassavetes spewing some very strange dialogue and NO ONE leers like he does.,1505433600,4,445,4.855263157894737

1715557,5,B000067IXH,"Totally awesome movie! I guess many people just can't appreciate the drama of it. It's wonderfully complex and very well acted, the cinematography and scene construction is top class for a B movie, the conclusion is unguessable right down to the finish. Very well done and worth 5 stars!

UPDATE: You know I must also add that many viewers will probably be turned off by the powerlessness of the female rape victims. In the movie they are just totally scared victims who can't, and don't, fight back in any way. In that sense this movie is out of step with more modern sensibilities that wish to see women as capable of defending themselves totally, or at least to a high degree. So in that manner the movie seems sort of  ""1950's-ish"". I didn't 100% like that aspect myself, but it doesn't have to interfere with the production qualities of the movie.",1450569600,3,852,4.635761589403973

The supernatural is a good source for scary material, but when you blend it with the subject of rape-murders, the result is very distasteful. Also, it is brainless, suggesting that witch hunts, and putting witches on torture racks, were events of a few decades ago.  I squirmed to see the great John Cassavetes in this miserable slop. It was doubtlessly to fund his own filmmaking projects.  There are many worthy horror pictures, do not see this stinker.",1412035200,,571,4.795918367346939

Director John Hough (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-Of-Hell-House/dp/B000VIMJUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend Of Hell House</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twins-Of-Evil-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo-Pack/dp/B007ZFSBWW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twins Of Evil (Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack)</a>) is able to generate some decent suspense in the attack scenes and the haunted small town atmosphere definitely works in the film's favor.  The score by Stanley Myers is also quite good, helping to build the anticipation and the dread.  Speaking of music, Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden makes an appearance along with his old band Samson.  Cassavetes is a bit unlikable as Dr. Cordell, coming across very gruff and at times, borderline hostile.  That's not a deal breaker for me but some may be put off by the performance.  Kerrie Keane as Laura Kincaid is a bit stiff.  Her delivery of the line, ""I don't like to be berated by Hank!"" stands out as a particularly bad line delivery.  One can sympathize, dear Laura, nobody likes to be berated by HANK!  On a side note, the film also features Harvey Atkin, who some may remember as Morty in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Meatballs/dp/B008ATL0RA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Meatballs</a>.

1715593,4,B000067IXH,"Scorpion Releasing continues their Katarina's Nightmare Theater line with this (unfortunately bare bones) release, in the form of a forgotten supernatural thriller called The Incubus (not the Shatner flick).

As previously stated, the plot is rediculously simple (not to mention just plain rediculous). A rapist/murderer whom may or may not be of supernatural descent is running around raping and murdering women. None of this is shown on-screen of course otherwise we all would have heard of this bizarre lil' film. In fact, don't expect anything in the way of action or gore. The focus of this film is the hunt for the killer so there is dialogue-a-plenty. Mix in some corny occult references and the occasional flashback of some kind of ritualistic sacrifice, and you have yourself a daisy of a confusing film here. Katarina herself does her usual silly open and closing segments, but that is the only extras you will find here.

But really, does any of that matter? If you have been following Scorpion Releasing's genre offerings from the last year or so, you are well aware that their current focus is to dig up the most grimy, sleazy lost films they can. In that respect, they are doing just fine and I've been happy to see these crazy films which, while non of them winners or classics in their own right, are perfect for making your girlfriend question your taste in films.

The Incubus is another great late-night film and the ending was pretty clever, if not a bit abrupt. If you are a hardcore horror film aficionado and feel you have it all, this is a great title that will undoubtedly stand out in your collection. Just be forewarned, this is not really a horror film, no more than American Nightmare was. Thriller seems to fit the overall subject matter here.

I'm looking forward to their next release, Human Experiments. Keep it up Scorpion Releasing!",1360800000,13,1867,4.825
1715594,4,B000067IXH,"what a story! a monster runs amok through a small town destroying women with his love tool. You would think Troma would have come up with this one except I know that it is an actual(supposedly) story in the bible. In a flashback scene the monster makes some monks airborne as he rendevous with a tied up naked witch and we get to see one big inward ""thrust"". This movie could have been a joke but because of john cassavetes dramatic support ensuring tension from beginning to end, good effects including the creepy devil monster, and plenty of unexpected scares, you get a unique film experience. The film score brilliantly complements every scene. Naked women's asses also complement with two very nice ones that I can remember. The only thing that bothered me was it ended too soon and left us hanging. 16x9 picture from elite is very nice.",1360108800,,842,4.657718120805369
1715595,4,B000067IXH,"This is a low budget, intense and pretty disturbing shocker from 1981 that is still unnerving today. The small town of Galen is being terrorized by a serial rapist/murderer that is leaving a very bloody trail in it's wake. A doctor, policeman and a mysterious reporter try to unravel the mystery before the assailant strikes again. The movie is based on a gruesome, but well written novel of the same name. While the movie's low budget shows, it does feature decent cinematography, acting and a creepy score.

Oh yeah, there's a very weird dynamic between the doctor and his daughter, that adds to the squirm inducing plot of the movie. Weird.

If you like early horror, slasher and supernatural movies, give Incubus a try. It's handled sort of like a murder mystery at first, before the story starts to really unfold. Again it's about a rapist/murdering demon, so prepare for some disturbing shenanigans.",1358899200,,905,4.908496732026144

""The Incubus"" is a typical 80's horror movie and should be viewed as such.  The plot centers around a young man named Tim who has nightmares of women being raped and murdered by a demon, only to awaken and find the murders have happened for real.  Tim confides his nightmares in his girlfriend Jenny.  Jenny decides to tell her father (John Cassavetes), who happens to be the town's doctor and pathologist, about Tim's nightmares.  Dr. Cordell begins helping the police chief investigate the murders and finds an ancient book that tells of the Incubus, a demon that appears to men and can be sexually interchangeable in human form.  Now, Cordell must monitor Tim's nightmare to find out who the Incubus is and put a stop to the demon before there are anymore murders! This movie does not break any new ground in the horror department, but it is not as bad as some people say it is.

1715624,2,B000067IXH,"Incubus (John Hough, 1981)

Twenty-seven years after the release of Incubus, I finally get round to seeing it. I've somehow had it in the back of my mind all these years that it was a sequel of sorts to Wes Craven's 1980 film Deadly Blessing; nothing could be further from the truth. Depressing. Take that, childhood illusions! In hindsight, Incubus was probably the start of director John Hough's downward spiral; before this, he'd directed some widely acclaimed films (Dirty Mary Crazy Larry, Escape to Witch Mountain). After this, well, there was Biggles: Adventures in Time. What hath Hollywood wrought?

The thin-as-onionskin storyline (adapted by George Franklin-- one of only two scripts he wrote that was ever produced-- from a Ray Russell novel I have yet to track down) concerns a teen who begins having visions of women being raped and murdered. After a bunch of ""oh, it's just a phase"" hooey, his doctor discovers that the things he's seeing in these dreams are actually happening. So is the kid the killer, or is there something else at work here? (Given that this is a horror film, I'm sure you can determine the answer on your own.)

Hough put together a pretty decent cast for this movie, then proceeded to waste it. John Cassavettes headlines as the intrepid doctor; recognizable character actor John Ireland plays the town sherriff; Erin Flannery (now Noble) plays the kid's girlfriend. (The kid himself is played by Duncan McIntosh, in the first role of his very short career.) None of them come close to a reasonable performance. That said, I'm relatively sure the actors aren't to blame; the story seemed a framework that Hough could use as filler between the murders. Quite a disappointment, this, though certainly not the worst movie I've seen in the past month. **",1206403200,,1788,4.913907284768212
