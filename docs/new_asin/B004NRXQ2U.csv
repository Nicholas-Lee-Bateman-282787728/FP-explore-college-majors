8436787,5,B004NRXQ2U,"A most extraordinary and beautiful dramatization of love conquering an emotionally traumatizing childhood of a little boy by a whole community of quirky but loving citizens and family!  One can be moved to tears and laughter simultaneously during this film, I recommend it for both artistic and drama content.",1481241600,,309,5.3061224489795915
