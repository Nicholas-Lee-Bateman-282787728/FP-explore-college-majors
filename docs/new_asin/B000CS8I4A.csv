2472611,5,B000CS8I4A,"My boys had a year of piano lessons they hated; then I got this dvd and its much cheaper than lessons, enjoyable, and the kids didn't mind practicing anymore. Recommended.",1264550400,11,171,4.733333333333333
2472612,5,B000CS8I4A,"My seven year old son wanted to learn piano, so I bought a traditional piano book for children--he ended up in tears. I was searching for a way to teach him which wouldn't destroy his passion and creativity, or steal his joy of learning. While walking through the library, the title ""Piano for Quitters"" caught my eye. Within days, my son was writing beautiful chord progressions and asking for ""music practice"" to be added to his daily work chart so he could play the piano before his other jobs were done. Our whole family is now learning to play the piano and loving it! I am a former piano quitter--I managed to survive one year of traditional piano lessons, and tried various other piano methods, but by using Piano for Quitters (and it's sequal: Piano for Life), I am learning to play beautiful music along with my children and husband.",1125273600,12,842,4.62
2472633,5,B000CS8I4A,"Mark Almond's ""Piano For Quitters"" will release all the inner anger one carries from childhood 'lessons.' Guaranteed. I've longed to play freely without sheet music for a long time. Mark releases all the nuggets of piano mystery incrementally so that you can stop and replay those light bulb moments again and again to gain confidence and freedom. It is exactly what I was hoping for from one who was stuck simmering where I was years ago. I recommend it to anyone who longs to play as simply as Carl Doy or compose your own compositions. Hopefully, for you too, it will come to you like the Berlin wall falling down when you absorb his nuggets in each short lesson. And then you will sense the freedom of the keys. May that force be with you.",1422057600,6,743,4.511111111111111
2472634,5,B000CS8I4A,This is a great way to pick back up playing. He has a gentle and quiet way of instructing which appeals to me. Easy to follow and I like the review at the end of each lesson. Will be buying the other things he has.,1418428800,5,214,3.7777777777777777

2472637,5,B000CS8I4A,"Thank you to Mark Almond for this terrific shortcut into the world of piano. I've always craved being able to sit at a piano and just play something well--not hunt and peck stumbling around hitting sour notes, but actual real, fluid, beautiful piano sounds. This series has taught me just that--and in my very 1st lesson! Now as I progress through your technique, my original compositions are sounding fuller, more fluid, and more elegant all the time. I'll never be afraid to sit at any piano and start noodling around again. Your technique has also fast tracked my other music skills--singing, harp and guitar--the whole theory of chord progressions and how to use them is made so easy in your lessons--it's brought my composing and arranging skills for all of my music to a higher level---and did I mention how much fun it is? Thank you!!!",1398643200,2,842,4.773972602739726
2472638,2,B000CS8I4A,The graphics are terrible and has a lot of ghosts. Would return if I did not have to incur additional cost.,1398384000,3,107,4.142857142857143
2472639,5,B000CS8I4A,Great course for anyone starting out on the piano. Not only for quitters that are giving it a second shot.,1389312000,7,106,4.35
2472640,5,B000CS8I4A,This is a fantastic way to learn piano. It gives one confidence to keep going and allows one to make music right away.,1386547200,2,118,4.173913043478261
2472641,5,B000CS8I4A,Step one in Mark Almonds series; the man knows how to teach.  I found this both comprehensive and easy to learn...good job!,1287532800,9,123,4.590909090909091
2472642,5,B000CS8I4A,We have a copy of this that my son learned to play piano with and he plays amazingly well. We purchased another copy to give to a friend of ours who also has learned to play beautifully.,1278892800,14,186,4.054054054054054
8101632,5,B000CS8I4A,"My son showed an interest in playing piano just like his father (me). I was mostly taught by gleaning from many throughout my life. I was obviously not qualified to teach, yet lessons were too expensive for me to afford. This WILL teach you to play, but it is a shortcut. He learned to play beautifully with this short DVD series. He will have to work backwards if he ever wants to go to school for music, but for church and home play it works wonders as a quick start.",1489190400,3,469,4.222222222222222
8101633,5,B000CS8I4A,"This is easy and fun.  I use it again and again.  And when I use this DVD, I believe I can really play because it makes playing the piano easy.",1481328000,,143,3.7333333333333334
8101634,5,B000CS8I4A,My son loves it.,1481241600,,16,3.25
8101635,5,B000CS8I4A,"As of 9/17/2016, the first three lessons are available on his website as free previews. Lesson 3 sold me on the dvd (actually I bought the streaming version). He explains chord structure in a way I've never seen before, making it super simple to build major and minor chords anywhere on the keyboard. And while I kind of knew that major chords are ""happy"" and minor chords are ""sad"", his description of dark tones and bright tones made the connection for me in a much more fundamental way. Later lessons introduce 7th chords, 6ths and 10ths in a way that's just as easy.
I see there are a lot of piano courses which use the chord approach to get you playing quickly--that is, playing chords and rhythms, rather than reading notes and melody. I even tried one of them, but it taught the chords individually (this is how we make a D minor chord, this is how we make an A minor chord, etc.) I would say if you want to try the chord approach, Piano for Quitters is the most efficient I've ever seen.
Edited to add: My mistake, the description of bright and dark tones is in another free preview, Lesson 2 of the Piano for Life (not Piano for Quitters) set.",1474070400,,1152,4.38785046728972
8101636,5,B000CS8I4A,"Loved it , really helped my daughter pick up and play again , she'd just about quit after years of lessons!!",1458864000,,108,4.190476190476191

8101640,2,B000CS8I4A,"I can only recommend this with reservation... because while I believe the concept is sound, the implementation is flawed in some areas. For example , I applaud his acknowledgement that he didn't create this method, that it was one used by past classical students who went on to become masters. So its good that he's giving credit where it's due. His demonstrations are fairly logical, and his approach is personable without being condescending or pushy. My problem is with how the info in the booklet is laid out. I understand the distinction between AM and Am, but when he starts showing the left hand functions, he cleary states that the key is a minor - even though the booklet makes no such statement. But he makes a point to display a flat. So what is he saying? That all the left-hand parts are minor keys unless it's a flat?
So, in conclusion: Good idea, good presentation, but the documentation could use some clarifying.",1444953600,4,929,4.705521472392638
8101641,5,B000CS8I4A,"This is great for folks like me.  I did take piano lessons as a child and quit.  This is for people that just want to play a tune or two.  It is well produced and exactly as it said, had me playing a tune on the very first lesson.",1428364800,,230,3.6530612244897958
