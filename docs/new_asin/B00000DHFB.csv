7905944,4,B00000DHFB,"I am a route 66 collecter, and this was an ok dvd, but it could have been much better.  Too much was focused on the woman driving her red corvette, instead or more route 66 sights. Still a good dvd.  Just wish it showed more.",1365292800,,225,3.977777777777778
7905945,3,B00000DHFB,"I didn't think so harshly about this video. As far as I can tell, it was part of a series once aired on the Travel Network. Having a woman presenter is a bit different from the ""Buzz and Todd"" school of Route 66 documentaries, too. (B&T being  characters on the old ""Route 66"" TV series.) In the end, though, this is still lightweight. Hunter Reno (who?--apparently a fashion model) is pretty to look at but it's  a 45 minute TV tour that gives you some eye candy and doesn't fill you up. If you're a 66 road trip fan, this video is not essential.",1162684800,,547,4.25
7905946,1,B00000DHFB,I didn't care for the narrator. A corny video on some of the attractions along 66.  If you collect 66 videos make this the last one you buy.  If searching for a good video find one narrated by Michael Wallis...Route 66 an American Odyssey is a good one to start with,1010188800,4,266,4.196078431372549
