7952885,3,B00005RY9Y,"Great title right? Not so great movie. The movie is not that bad, for a first attempt.

The story takes place in a fictional Puerto Rico that has gained independence from the United States (so has Quebec). Angela (played by Maricarmen Aviles) has broken up with her husband; he kidnaps their kid. Pedro Juan (played by Jimmy Navarro) is Angela's teen love and now a representative of Puerto Rico in Quebec. He helps Angela get her son back and in the meantime, they rekindle their affair.

The movie fails in a number of levels. First, the plot of the movie is weak, has been done a thousand times and the only thing new about it was that Puerto Rico was independent. The movie was badly edited and rushed, trying to cram everything into 90 minutes. The acting is not terrible (it is not good either, and honestly, I was expecting better). But the actors cannot do much with what they are given.

So, the movie is somewhat entertaining but you may feel frustrated as to the plot, the pacing, and the acting.",1203379200,,1007,4.521978021978022
7952886,4,B00005RY9Y,"Interesting premise to think that Puerto Rico can be a Republic, not a commonwelth anymore.  The love story and the political subject matter are well intertwined.  It makes you think of what would become of Puerto Rico if it were not for the US.  Is this what is happening in Latin America?",1114819200,,290,4.538461538461538
7952887,1,B00005RY9Y,"I should have known better before buying this DVD. The plot is childish, the acting poor, look like a cheap soap opera. I regret the money spent on it.",1091059200,,151,4.241379310344827
