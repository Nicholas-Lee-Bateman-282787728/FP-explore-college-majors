8216050,5,B000V02CTG,"One of the great Roger Federer's finest matches - winning Wimbedon 2007 vs Nadal. I can't remember without checking if the full final is on this DVD or there is a 2nd separate one. But whichever, as always a superb ""Official film"" and part of my collection.",1427500800,,257,4.48936170212766
8216051,4,B000V02CTG,"Match highlights should be more taken from the top so that you can follow the rally (both players), rather than focusing on a player.",1208476800,,133,4.583333333333333
8216052,1,B000V02CTG,"If this is like the other Wimbledon ""best of"" discs, the following review will apply, and hopefully save you 25 bucks.

Total ripoff. Less than an hour including extras, more shots of crowd members than players, and the boring voice-over frequently reminding us that this is the only tennis tournament that really matters doesn't help a whit. A truly pointless dvd with very little tennis. Summing up hundreds of matches in about 30 minutes of footage? You do the math.
Might be worth buying only if you were there and hope to see yourself in the many audience shots. Otherwise, with barely any tennis on the disc, what's the point? Pure fluff.
Go instead to the infinitely better Classic Matches at Wimbledon series; the Borg/Mac 1980 dvd has more quality in five minutes than this does in 55, and costs half as much.
