5180700,2,B008SBXFNM,"This line from Tsoukalos' profile says it all:

""Giorgio is the publisher of Legendary Times Magazine, a widely circulated magazine that searches for evidence to support the ancient alien theory.""

""Searches for evidence to support..""...that's not being open minded; that's having an agenda.  You will always view things as being a certain way if you are seekig to prove a theory.  A scientist let's the evidence speak for itself.

One shuld also note the clear progression in the physical dietary habits of Tsoukalos and Philip Coppens as you move from season 1 through the last.  The increase in profit from these episodes has led to a dangerous change in lifestyle for these people.  Soon, the only episodes they will have will be massive coronaries if they don't change their ways.  Tsoukalos can no longer hide his chubby cheeks with his hair at this point and Coppens has traded the ""I will make love to you"" look for ""I will put mayonnaise on you"".  It's a fraud.

While I'm glad they have turned me on to some really interesting possibilities, it has become abundantly clear that there is no room for science at this point.  Do I believe in life outside of our galaxy?  I sure do.  Do I believe that we have been visited by extraterrestrials?  Highly possible!  But!  Don't for a minute think that we are so gullible, David Hatcher Childress.  You, my friend, are in need of medical attention.  You may have high blood pressure and some complications caused by Diabetes.  You are very entertaining, at least.

I'll continue watching these, however, as I love the topic.  I've got books by Von Danniken, Coppens, Childress, and the like - and they will be read.  I'm just not that easily influenced...",1348531200,7,1708,4.777397260273973
5180701,1,B008SBXFNM,"So. Because ""the local media reported more than 1,000 UFO sightings over the inundated shoreline"" following the 2011 tsunami, that deserved serious speculation that the sightings had anything to do with extraterrestrials. Fine. If I were one of this series' producers, I too would have entertained and offered those thoughts; how else would I have profited (much less have gotten my pilot episode financed at all) if I had offered more likely explanations for what may be observed during and following  natural events, such as - in the case of the tsunami - the UFOs actually being the likely unprecedented number of news media and rescue team aircraft that were sent aloft to investigate the disaster sites. Plain and reasonable answers are SO boring... and unprofitable.",1346976000,8,772,5.126984126984127
5180702,4,B008SBXFNM,"The History Channel has found its footing once again with the newest season of Ancient Aliens.  While some of the theories remain ""out there"", these episodes explore many possible connections to alien intervention.

The show itself is first-class when providing historical background and finding similarities between unexplained events throughout Earth's ancient past.  However, the conclusions that are made are still speculative and do not always directly link these mysterious events to aliens.  All other possibilities seem to be dismissed and we are left with ""it was aliens and couldn't have been anything else"" as explanations.

The episodes are entertaining and will make anyone with an open mind second-guess the history we were led to believe.",1344816000,67,753,5.51304347826087

It met my expectations, not only in the episodes of strange and bazaar happenings around the world, but alsoespecially the episode about ""Puma Punco""  How could those huge stones have been cut to such precision?  It is beyond explanation.  It was this episode which I wanted to have in my collection so my kids and grandkids will be able to see the physical evidence of such an enigma.

5180771,5,B008SBXFNM,"Just finished watching ""Ancient Aliens - Season Four"" released by the History Channel.
Oh this series is a down right hoot to watch. It really tries to model itself after the classic ""In Search Of"" series that was hosted by Leonard Nimoy, but it falls far, far from the mark. Still, its just plain old silly and harmless fun to watch - especially when you see how many different spins they can put on the same old, same old material.
Kicking off the the Mayan Doomsday Calendar theory - wait, we survived that one - to various other alien doomsday prophecies, to aliens having a connection to Big Foot - no, not the Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman connection - to aliens being responsible for taking Leonardo da Vinci back and forth through time - to aliens really being humans from the future - an Issac Asimov story that originally appeared in Boys' Life - and last but not least - those evil aliens were responsible for killing of the dinosaurs by causing...wait for it...climate change - GASP!
It's really mindless entertainment - but I will note, since Senior SETI Astronomer Seth Shostak and other NASA scientists and well not only add their voice to this nonsense, but they help give it credibility. Which does tend to beg the question Dr. Shostak, you ridicule people who believe in G_D, yet you support people who believe that aliens built the pyramids and gave knowledge to humanity? Illogical, as a famous fictional alien was fond of saying.

5180887,1,B008SBXFNM,"A mixture of lies, misrepresentations and hocus pocus.  The ancient aliens theorists have long hoped for a more public and legitimate forum to air their idiotic, groundless ideas.  And now the History Channel has given it to them, along with its full support.  The theorists, given the systematic inaccuracies and outright fabrications in their statements, obviously know nothing about the dozens of cultures, sites and issues about which they are touted as ""experts.""  Simple internet research, for example, quickly gives the lie to their claims.  A few examples: the Brookings report did not recommend hiding knowledge of alien life if found; Annunaki does not mean ""those who from the heavens came""; far from there being ""no tools"" found at Golbeki Tepe, a great treasure of them was found; and on and on.  Evidence contrary to their claims is not mentioned.  And contrary opinions are carefully edited to make them sound supportive.  More fundamentally, the entire edifice is founded on nothing more than the ""beliefs"" of individual people.  The premise of every episode and nearly every ""account"" is that ""some people believe"" X or Y.  No evidence.  No argument.  No actual reason for believing so.  Just simple belief.  That makes it so.

The only ""evidence"" is unverified (and often unverifiable) claims which are taken as gospel truth.  And the only arguments are that since some people or some cultures believe X (insert any alleged phenomenon from sky gods to the bermuda triangle), that ""it is possible"" that aliens are at work.  Count the number of times that ""Is it possible?"" is asked on the show.

Never any concrete evidence.  Only lights in the sky.  Only conjectures that aliens must be at work because humans could never have build the pyramids of Egypt or Machu Picchu.  The true believers are--and this is not meant as an insult but a description of fact--self-deluding morons.

What is truly tragic is that the History channel is using its air time to dumb people down rather than to educate.",1418169600,,2014,4.984984984984985

5180977,1,B008SBXFNM,"I guess there's always a new crop of 8 year olds whose imaginations requires constant feeding.  These shows should come with a warning that viewers over the age of 8 should know watching this can cause stupid.  And someone needs to tell Londo Mollari's son that the 90's called and wants its hair back.

I watched this episode, not because I believe aliens built pyramids,but because they were going to show pyramids in China, Indonesia, etc.  Then the ignorant hosts went there....  ""How is it possible that mankind all over the planet managed to build pyramids?  That fact alone means they must have had a teacher.  An alien teacher.""

Chuckle.  Anyone watching kids at the beach with a bucket and a plastic shovel know there are only 2 shapes that hold.  And anyone who's ever tried to build anything without any training knows the pyramid is the only shape that holds and is stable.  So it's not aliens were here from 10000BC to 1300AD showing us how to build pyramids without leaving a single bit or refuse behind.  That's as ridiculous as is this show which has as much to do with history as ice road truckers or whatever other silly hillbillies they offer.",1414627200,,1163,4.647058823529412

HOW COULD THEY IGNORE THE BIG PLAGIARISM CLOUD OVER AND ABOVE EINSTEIN. OLINTO DE PRETTO , MATHEMATICIAN,DID IN FACT PUBLISH AND REGISTER TWICE THE RELATIVITY  FORMULA IN ITALY IN 1902 And 1903. SUCH EVENTS ARE WELL PROTECTED BY DOCUMENTS IN VENICE MUSEUM. THE ELEMENTS OF THE FORMULA EXERCISES ARE EXACTELY THE SAME. OLINTO DE PRETTO WAS ASSINATED JUST IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE NOBEL PRIZE OF EINSTEIN, ISN'T THIS INTERESTING AND COINCIDENTAL?  RECENTLY IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT ANOTHER VICTIM OF EINSTEIN PLAGIARISM HAS BEEN HIS OWN WIFE, WHO MANY CONSIDER HER A BETTER MATHEMATICIAN THAN THE HUSBAND. SO HOW IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THESE FINDINGS WERE IGNORED AND THEY WENT AHEAD MAKING EINSTEIN A POSSIBLE ALIEN AMONG US HUMAN. IT SMELL OF FABRICATION! WELL, JUDGE FOR YOURSELF, LOOK FOR OLINTO DE PRETTO IN GOOGLE SEARCH AND START TO CONSIDER THAT IF EINSTEIN ACTUALLY WASN'T THE AUTHOR OF HIS WORK MAY VERY WELL BE HE COULD BE CONSIDERED A SUPER ALIEN THIEF..

You can't tell me one of those supposed astronauts didn't forget *something*.  And with all the digging done by anthropologists.. you'd think something might have shown up.. especially if these aliens were landing all over the ancient world..

Those in authority have always used fear and control over the underclass men so they can retain their power and control over us. This has been going on since the beginning of time. When you watch this show and they explain things it makes so much sense and just makes you want to lean more of what the truth really is. This is one of my all time favorite shows EVER!,1404950400,,490,4.168421052631579

To view the past is to see where we are going. Our limitations and our scientific discoveries have not shown that we can travel at the speed of light without descentgrating ourselves. There are many theories out there yet to be proven and put into practice.

The dramatization is of Soap Opera grade if not higher.

Why did I choose this rating? because zero stars isn't possible. Preposterous drivel. 45 minutes of very little content
What did I like? I now know of a new tongue-twister: Puma Punku (try saying it 20 times as fast as you can)

Who do I recommend this to? Philosophy students; they'd have a blast pointing the logical fallacies. The one that stared me in the face was confirmation bias.

I don't want free music to stream, I want to pay 79$ for prime! I thought 79$ was too much! Amazon is has turned into walmart.  Anyone remember when super walmart first came out it was so clean and the people who worked there so educated and friendly?  Remember when they had a three customers in a line a new cash register will be opened policy?  Remember when walmart used to stock their shelves in the middle of the night instead of during the busiest time of the day?  Remember when made in America was their slogan?  Now that they drove all the mom and pop stores out of business look at walmart.  The stores are filthy, a lot of the people who work their look and act like they just got out of prison, the isles are always crammed with huge pallets to be stocked during the busiest times, and everything is Chinese.  Also, the prices aren't any better than anyone elses.  Walmart is a bully.  Amazon has gotten a little too big for it's britches and is getting just like walmart.  I find the prices better elsewhere and that makes up more than enough for shipping.  Plus, most online vendors give free shipping over 50$ anyway.  Good luck Amazon!

5181268,2,B008SBXFNM,"The number of leaps that this show takes to get to its conclusions can make one's head spin.  Every time a great feat of human engineering is posed, they assume that laziness ruled the day and declare that alien intervention was the likelier reason than (you know) human ingenuity.  The number of times that partial evidence was provided, or misrepresented, to come to their conclusions are too many to name.

I sit here and try to understand why..  why was this show made?  Who decided that it was a worthy investment in time and money?  Why was it aired on the History channel?

I ask these questions and the only answer I can come up with is: must have been the aliens, right?",1403308800,,679,4.471544715447155

Usually this show looks at ancient sites and tries to bend the truth slightly to proove it was either inspired by or built by aliens.  This season got too caught up I. Trying to be Nostradamus or Edgar Casey and predict the future. And as we are past the predicted time it made a show that is mostly bolony with a hint of well maybe....into just plain bolony. Is not a good season at all. More of a well they bought this lets see if they will buy into this story. Insulting. Do not waste your time,1402617600,,611,4.126050420168068

May be if indeed there were ancient aliens that visited the world and gave technology to the people back then.  I have to be honest as well in part that sometimes whether or not some of the things they talk about is correct or not.  Regardless it is a great show.,1401148800,,419,4.2784810126582276

5181342,2,B008SBXFNM,"Most science has at base faith--in the scientific theory propounded.  Even atheists must have faith that they are correct.  I watched a few episodes of this series and found it to be peopled with experts who see pictograms of aliens in space crafts in Mesoamerican and other peoples' hieroglyphics.

Just like Christians, these folks hold that aliens have come to earth and will return.  And they base their theory on the writings and inscriptions found on structures of peoples who no longer have a distinct national group.  Any science that says something like, ""We think aliens have visited earth in the past.  We interpret this 'evidence' that aliens have visited earth in the past to mean they'll come again.  We impose our interpretation on writings that can, by a very creative stretch of the imagination, suggest pictures of 'beings' in 'space suits' in 'space crafts'.  And we expect the aliens to return 12/12/2012"" is suspect to my mind.  Could be why this series is not popular these days.

I gave it two stars because the theories are interesting if shaky, and the program is well produced.  I also enjoyed the youthful enthusiasm of the experts--some of whom have most likely been looking for aliens throughout history for 40 years or more.",1400630400,,1254,4.895734597156398
5181343,1,B008SBXFNM,"I grew up in the 70's, enthralled by the old series with narration by Leonard Nimoy: Ancient Aliens, Ancient Astronauts, Ancient Antique Alien Astronauts...
Originally played Ancient Aliens Season 4 as background noise. Am involved with a group of people, many of whom believe this kind thing. So...Okay lemme listen, as an adult, to these presented ideas and facts, I use that latter term loosely, and see what I think almost 40 years later.

I think... it's silly. The idea that humankind had help from an alien race defies every law of physics. In particular the Speed of Light. Einstein wept.
The aliens would have been old enough to be mummified give the possible plant that we know of, clsest to the earth, maye could be potentially possible of supporting some kind of life form.
Have been watching the new version of Cosmos -which is wonderful and recommended highly-. There are many wonders in this world, From the 'Great Dying.' from which our ancestors somehow survived, to the possibilities of life in other galaxies.

As a student of physics, and human belief, I know that there is an innate NEED to find meaning in pyramids, crop circles and mechanical prototypes.
Ancient Aliens -which is what they'd be after travelling for millennia to arrive here- aren't the answer.
We are. Even more magnificent and bewildering, and believeable.

Don't make me go on with specifics. It's early and Amazon requires I give a review with the highest possible rating for this show, and series...One Star.

That is due almost certainly to the fact that there are only so many unexplained prehistoric relics and sites around the world.  Season four does have some new information, however.  The episode about Leonardo Da Vinci is particularly interesting for its discussion of the artist's use of hidden messages and unorthodox techniques in his paintings.  While some viewers may be skeptical about the theory that Earth has been visited by beings from other planets in the distant past, the presence of ruins from earlier civilizations that used construction methods requiring advanced technology is a compelling argument that the current and generally accepted version of man's history needs to be revised.

Although I expected a show like this to stretch the truth a bit, I did at least expect them to work with extant texts and factual accounts.  I've caught this show multiple times in flat out lies.  They claim something was in the Bible, Koran, Torah, or other sacred texts, but a little research shows that those passages either never existed or are so heavily doctored that they don't even resemble the original.  I watch documentaries to be informed, not misinformed.  It's a cool concept, it just seems that they didn't really have any evidence so they made some up.

5181375,5,B008SBXFNM,"""The real question is where did they get the knowledge...""  They got the knowledge from curiousity.  In speaking about ancient Egyptian batteries and electric lamps, there is no question those things existed.  Rather, I think this series is a bit insulting to simply assume we the human race required intervention from aliens.  We are a curious lot.  And given enough people trying different things to understand their world (and/or to survive or offer a good /service to have a role in society), I posit it is inevitable that we discovered electricity.

For example, imagine you have an ancient Egyptian woman preparing a feast for 1000 people.  She's one of a group of chefs preparing this meal. This woman is responsible for the juicing of lemons.  It's all she does for an afternoon.  After a time, she's got a terracotta urn filled with lemon juice for the hundreds of pounds of falafel dough or whatever.  As shes stirring it up, she dips her arms into the lemon juice and gets a mild shock.  On one arm, she has a bangle made of copper, on the other arm a bangle made of silver and zinc, creating a dielectric.  Not only is this scenario likely, it's inevitable.  I'm sure you've experienced the same thing with putting a gum wrapper in your mouth and having a zing from your mercury amalgam filling.

It's inevitable that we discovered electricity.  Ancient people were more or less the same people we have today because evolution doesn't work that quickly.  If you can say anything it's that culture has evolved and now we are sufficiently advanced to understand exactly that we don't really know much about the past but at least we're on the court, playing the game of catch-up.",1399766400,,1688,4.72945205479452
5181376,4,B008SBXFNM,This show is the definition of a guilty pleasure. The absurdity of some of the 'facts' and 'evidence' presented is almost neo-dadaist in nature.

Just taking every random human achievement and barely tying it tangentially to aliens is a leap even for a series with a premise such as this one.

There is more David Childress and a little less Giorgio Tsoukolos (sp?), but i like Dave and Giorgio makes up for his scarcity by claiming even zanier things are proof positive of alien activity. The show in. general seems to be taking a less conventional look at alien theories as they try to make an argument that fingers bigfoot and the dinosaurs as consorts of the greys.

It seems the producers and the scientists have this idea that human being were just not smart enough to drag themselves out of the caveman era.

The opinions, especially of the show's regulars, always expressed with a ton of equivocation, have devolved into absurdity. As an example of how far this show has stretched, the ""original Rocket Man"" on the sarcophagus lid is animated by the show's producers with blue exhaust flames lifting off into the heavens. A small 3D scale model of the ""Rocket Man"" had interpretive ""exhaust ports"" added where the ""exhaust fire"" was previously displayed. I was in stitches.  It doesn't make any sense for the ""Rocket Man"" to be sitting directly on top of the exhaust ports, unless his conveyance is flatulence-propelled. Rather than imagining an appropriate conveyance for the ""Rocket Man"" to control, they just stuck flaming and unfueled engine nozzles under his chair. And while the ""ancient alien theorists"" offer dozens of examples of space suits carved in stone, the ""Rocket Man"" launches into space half-naked with an oxygen mask on a stick attached to his nose. It's all so silly and makes no sense whatsoever.

The discussants are almost all scientists with Ph. D degrees in various relevant fields. Each segment covers a different aspect of alien involvement on earth. Proof of alien visits is visually presented by showing paintings and drawings on the walls of caves or huge rocks. The entire series is in color with background music. Some viewers might say it is too highly produced, but I think the use of a good presentation is stimulating, and adds to the overall interest in thecontent. I learned a great deal, and came away convinced of the proposition: that extra-territorial aliens have visited our planet at various times, and the evidence is that they have been very helpful to people here. We can only speculate on their motives but, unlike some earlier productions showing aliens as hostile, e.g. War of the Worlds by H.G.

There's just not enough room in this review to put all the facts down that when looked at with an open, LOGICAL mind is undeniable. Ancient Aliens is, for the most part very good at laying out the undeniable evidence that life exsits elsewhere in the cosmos. Even more interesting is that E.T beings have been modifying / interfering / controlling our development for most likely 10's of thousands of years. A.

The show is, well was, fascinating enough without the continual effort to make it dramatic.  In other words, it's become so overdone that it's almost unwatchable.  Some of the theorists, such as Georgio Tsoukalos, destroy their credibility by saying that one and only one conclusion can be drawn about a set of data when there are obviously several ways to interpret them.  It would be a dynamic show if they would make their case without the huckster showmanship and it would be even better if they would collectively review their conclusions and weed out the ridiculously inconsistent ones before making a fool of themselves by proposing them with no apparent forethought.  A good example would be the supposed destruction of Puma Punko by nuclear or high energy holocaust when there is not one shred of presented evidence of even one piece of melted slag on the site.  It would seem that the theorist had never seen the results of a nuclear blast, or even an atomic one for that matter.",1397779200,10,1096,4.803191489361702

Did we truly make it this far by our own volition, or did we have help?  The contributors to this series continue to make a compelling case that we indeed had prompting throughout our time here, and take a logical approach to the evidence that is scattered around the globe.

I rated this series a 4 simply because the series is well assembled, the content is intelligible, and the subject matters of each episode are not sensationalized to the point of fantasy.  I deducted one start for some editing that was not, in my opinion, consistent with an educational and though-provoking mode.

Not only do the forefront of scholars back up their theories with a massive amount of data, it is incredibly difficult to pigeonhole the conclusions they present.  It warrants an attentive ear and an open mind.  After watching season 4, what conclusions will you come to?

But as a so-called ""Star gate,"" just think about it, the stars that form this constellation are actually thousands of light years away from each other.

From the contorted interpretation of an Inca chieftain ensconced in an ""obviously"" alien spacecraft (replete with thruster plumes) to equally ""undeniable"" alien visages of major gods, the sky is the limit in weaving fantastical scenarios to explain an ancient culture malleable to any number of viewpoints and flights of speculation.  All of it - ALL - without a single verifiable shred of archeological, paleo-climatological, linguistic, biological, geological or even astronomical, physical or cosmological supporting factual evidence.  A mummified alien DNA sequence?  No way.  Energy technologies like electricity that would predate James Clerk Maxwell's discovery?  Sorry.  Unique food residues and extraterrestrial seeds of unearthly plants?  No trace.  Metal alloy remnants impervious to the heat generated from a spacecraft entering the earth's atmosphere (and capable of interplanetary flight)?  Nope, just sand, stone, gold, copper, etc.  Designs for self-driven transportation vehicles like cars or planes beyond animal-powered carts?  Just solo hermetic images subject to the wildest (mis)interpretations.  Even a truly extra-worldly language or script that proves incapable of human decryption?  The glyphs have all been decoded (and the tales they tell are not even all that interesting - the usual non-alien cultural royal lineages and war victories).  Boiled down, the whole premise seems to rest on the - admittedly - highly advanced for the time mathematical calculation methods and aptitudes - especially the ""prescient"" calendar which predicted the ""end of the world"".  Well ... 2012 came and went and neither the Incas nor their alien cohorts got that one right either.  In short, there are two parallel stories being told here that - like infinite parallel lines - never touch or intersect: marvelously tantalizing dreamworlds of imaginative mythic belief and seductive speculation awkwardly (or slyly and dishonestly) juxtaposed against  verifiable, hard scientific evidence-based fact.  Some of the worst intentionally editing and segueing one is ever going to see. The first is composed of all the ""truth"" of ""Star Wars"" or ""Harry ""Potter"".

Not one dissenting view.

I would love to believe that aliens visited us, and it might be true, but this show is so full of lies and BS that you cannot believe a word they say.

For a full dissection of this ""ancient alien"" look up ancient aliens debunked on youtube.

The truth is out there! Just not in here.

If ancient cultures could not have discovered advanced technologies that have since been lost that allowed them to construct monumental cities, complex languages, and so on without the intervention of extraterrestrial help, is saying that we could not have done the same thing ourselves today.  Human beings have not evolved. The books written by the ancient Greek philosophers are just as relevant and fresh today as they were 2500 years ago and more, addressing the same social and moral issues. I also find it troubling that the religious / spiritual beliefs of ancient peoples are discounted as being the descriptions of ignorant people trying to explain alien visitation. The beliefs of the various faiths that grew out the backwater desert province of the Roman Empire are not treated in a like manner, generally.

5181569,4,B008SBXFNM,"I've watched each season of ""Ancient Aliens"" repeatedly. I love this stuff.

To say that the content is speculative is a massive understatement. Aliens are everywhere. Basically if you flip over a rock in an exotic locale, you'll find an alien under it. Except that sometimes you won't. That's my favorite thing about this show. About ninety-nine percent of the time, the cast of ""ancient alien theorists"" attribute everything to aliens. The remaining five percent consists of Giorgio declaring that one theory or another is as crazy as his hair, only to replace it with an even crazier theory. ""Did aliens construct Mount Everest out of recycled beer cans? No. Of course not. That's ridiculous. But did they use Mount Everest as a fortress from which to monitor humans below? Absolutely.""

Ever since I discovered a battered old paperback of ""Chariots of the Gods"" in the library when I was a child, I've been fascinated by things such as the Nazca lines, the Bermuda Triangle, Stonehenge, Easter Island, etc. I've heard plenty of prosaic explanations for all of those things -- and I tend to believe those explanations -- but von Daaniken and ""Ancient Aliens"" provide vastly more entertaining explanations. Unbelievable ones, to be sure, but fascinating ones.

It's fun to listen to the narrator carefully avoid any definitive statements, instead casting things in the form of questions or attributing beliefs to unnamed theorists, but in a way I think these shows are great for exposing people to a larger vision of the world and to different belief systems. I don't accept ""Ancient Aliens'"" explanations at face value, but the show has informed me about places I didn't know existed. Some of these places up in the mountains of Peru or in the Middle East or wherever are incredibly cool with incredibly interesting oral histories. I wouldn't have stumbled upon those locations on my own; this show led me to them.

So I don't believe the theories put forth on the show. But I love the show, because speculation is a fun mental exercise and because I've learned new things from it. Frankly, how much crazier is it to believe in ancient aliens than it is to believe in God or Allah or Buddha? Not much. Maybe it's not even as crazy as those other beliefs.",1390694400,6,2257,4.839378238341969

The ""Ancient Aliens"" episode ""Aliens and Bigfoot"" combined the best and the worst as far as I'm concerned. I want to believe in Jeff Meldrum and his claims about the squatch being a real, flesh-and-blood animal. And yes, I hate the guts of Erich von Dniken, Zecheriah Sitchin and their lesser breed imitators. Ancient aliens? Hilarious nonsense!

Yet, here they come...

""Aliens and Bigfoot"" is a veritable extravaganza of the good, the bad and the really ugly. Apart from Jeff Meldrum (who is reasonably sane), the episode features interviews with Nick Redfern, David Hatcher Childress, Philip Coppens, Linda Moulton Howe and a few lesser lights. One of the talking heads actually looks like an alien! He would certainly scare me on a UFO convention, LOL.

The speculations are, of course, wild. Pun intended. Are the Bigfeet or Wildmen products of alien genetic engineering? Are they alien-human hybrids? Was Goliath an alien? You know, the guy who fought with David. Or are *we* the products of alien genetic engineering? Perhaps the aliens inserted their DNA in some captured Bigfoot, thereby creating us? Or are the smelly squatches aliens themselves, living in underground caverns to avoid detection while on Earth?

Ha ha ha. Yeah, sure. An entirely alien race from Zeta Ridiculous has DNA compatible with that of earthling primates...

Another funny speculation: the Egyptian gods must be the result of genetic engineering by mad scientists, since they look like crosses between humans and various animals. Geezus, don't these guys know it's a shamanic thing?! I'm sure somebody can give the producers of ""Ancient Aliens"" some illicit, psychedelic substance  la Aldous Huxley or Huston Smith. They'll meet Anubis or Thoth in no time.

Besides, what are these guys thinking? Do they really imagine that far-away planets with self-respect would give rise to creatures such as Skunk Ape or Man?

Clearly, as ancient astronaut theory contends, this gets two thumbs up.

Von Danikin  peaked my interest with his first book and with  all the other books after that one.  I would suggest AA to anyone with a belief in UFO's and possible visits over the many centuries (or millions of years) of the past.  I am not one to spend time with religious matters, but if the Church I attended as a child had recognized the realities of the past, I would have likely become somewhat more of a believer.  The idea that the world began a little over 2000 years ago is absurd.  Even the Bible has an Old Testament.  AA gives some credibility to the Bible IF religions had the sense to accept the fact that many of the miracles and happenings could have been created by visitors from beyond.",1374278400,2,820,4.493243243243243

Moreover, the subject matter is dealt with in an intelligent manner that does not require you to ""check your brains"" at the door.
There are a lot of mysteries in the world that neither science or religion can answer.  This series offers an alternative that, while it may not probable, is at least possible.

This series is a vindication of the ideas that were presented in Erich von Daniken's landmark book, ""The Chariot of the Gods"".  Now in its fifth season, the show continues to fascinate and to educate.  Each episode takes the reader on a virtual globe-hopping trip to some of the most fascinating and the most mysterious sites.  The third season went over the edge with its ideas, but this fourth season is back on track with the show's original themes.  In this particular episode, the topic is Puma Punku.

Puma Punku has been mentioned on the show numerous times in the past.  But this episode is dedicated to the site and really tackles the mysteries in greater depth.  What I enjoyed most about this episode is Christopher Dunn's theory on the purpose of the stone artifacts.  He theorizes that these precisely-made stone devices were in fact elaborate door hinges.  It's really refreshing to have someone other than an archeologists present their ideas on these topics.  A skilled machinists like Dunn will have his unique perspective on these objects.  And the theory that he presents is just as valid as any other.  Dunn is one of the more interesting experts on the show.  He always backs up his ideas with a demonstration.

Ancient Aliens was a very entertaining show in its earlier seasons, and at times would make you seriously consider the possibilities proposed in it.  However, the show now is on a slippery slope between 3 and 4 stars at this time as the creators seem to be trying to tie the ancient astronaut/ancient alien theory into everything imaginable.  This of course actually detracts from any real credibility that authors on the subject of an alternate human history such as: Charles Hapgood, Robert Bauval, Arthur Posnansky, Graham Hancock, and Colin Wilson have been carefully trying to make known, with methods that use actual science.  It is difficult enough to try to substantiate that humans are far older than the currently accepted model allows for, and taking the aforementioned authors' ideas and drawing conclusions that it all has to be because of aliens is only polluting their alternate human history hypotheses and tainting the credibility of their work, as they are often mentioned on the show in conjunction with the ancient aliens idea.

Good science means the theories, ideas, and even laws can be disproved, so the current model, or ""mainstream archaeology's"" model of human origins is good science, and in many ways there are a still a lot of unknowns, and new unexplained findings that are left out of the model.  While I will not get into why these new ideas have not made it into the textbooks yet, I will say that the fact that the current model is so tightly held on to, makes our current scholars no better than the creators of Ancient Aliens.  The former leaves no debate for the possibility that advanced human civilizations could have been on this planet for much longer than is currently professed, while the latter leaves no room for the explanation of human origins and civilization to anything other than ancient aliens.

Unfortunately, any credibility that authors on the subject of ancient astronaut/ancient alien theory such as Zecharia Sitchin or Erich von Dniken also falls victim to this same predicament as they are also featured on the show.  These authors have theories that indicate actual research, and their conclusions are backed by their research into the subject matter.  The Summarian creation stories can be read by you (if you can read cuneiform), they are an actual account, and the events are very specific, and whereas Ancient Aliens was originally touching on these stories and ideas, it now seems to be going for just entertainment and sensationalism as the topics are all over the place, which is not a good thing for this kind of subject matter.

The show would get 4 stars because of the production, archaeological place settings, and the few bits and pieces that do lend some credibility to the idea of extra terrestrial visitors, as well as the ability of the writers to draw correlations to ancient aliens from pretty much anything, as that does show a somewhat talented team. However, because of the above mentioned concerns, which in all fairness indicate a lack of really wanting to look into the subject mater and instead just come up with any paranormal or mythological topic and tie that to ancient aliens so that they can get picked up for another season just to cash in, I will give it 3 stars.",1359244800,,3446,4.840136054421769

The show has definately opened my eyes to the posibility that our previous teachings haven been less than truthful and that we've been manipulated from our species birth. It's caused me to do alot of my own reading and research into mankind's origins and our leaps through our time on planet earth thus far. And I suppose that my own research has now eclipsed the shows ability to wow me. Many of the episodes in season four have been done in previous seasons and I fear that the show may have run it's course.

Granted, half the time I end up yelling at the TV set over something stupid one of the ""ancient alien theorists"" says, but basically it has been pure entertainment gold in a train wreck sort of way.  The only downside is there are people who take this drivel seriously, but there are people who took Oprah seriously, so who's to judge??

That being said, the fourth season had some definite jump the shark moments.  It's not as though I have high expectations (in four seasons the only possible evidence of advanced alien technology is Giorgio Tsoukaos' gravity-defying hair), but there seems to be an air of desperation or at least they are running out of topics.  In the fourth season, they actually tried to link aliens to the extinction of the dinosaurs (""this wasn't at extinction, it was an extermination!!""), bigfoot (please don't ask how), and the Da Vinci Code (hey, why stop at one crackpot theory?).  By the end of the season, one almost expected an ancient alien connection to the Girl Scouts.

So what's left?  Ancient Aliens and Alf? (""Was it really just a bad 80's TV show or was it, as ancient astronaut theorists believe, an alien presence hiding in plain sight?"")  The possiblilities are endless but I just might pass on next season.",1352332800,7,1313,4.723684210526316

This is why I gave the season a 3 star rating as that means that I am nuetral on that subject because I consider myself to be an agnostic of which even Jesus was reported to be.

""after a 30-foot tsunami ravaged Tohoku, Japan, the local media reported more than 1,000 UFO sightings over the inundated shoreline"". Then where is the picture proof from the many thousands of pictures that were taken?

And then they expect you to believe this stuff if that would have happened then it would have been all over the news and there were no reports of UFO over Japan at the time of the tsunami, it was a natural disaster created by an earthquake. But it's not to say that the governemtn was not involved in some ways. They agree with hydraulic fraking after all and that causes earthquakes. It even lights the water on fire because the gas mixes with the water as shown in that one video.

No wonder the price is so low for the entire season because these stories even though some of it is believeable the tire genre is interesting but a bit far fetched and in the realm of the unbelievable. Some of it just made up to sell dvd sets.

Although I do own seasons one two and three, I found the stuff on ancient civilizations quite compelling expecially when they showed the actual evidence.",1350259200,,1763,4.349544072948328
