8602112,4,B00E6MNREE,"As in many Hitchcock films, we know who committed the homicide in the title in the first few minutes. The rest of the movie is about the obsession of Roberto, the law professor, to trap and expose the criminal; through him and other characters the viewer obtains clues and hints about the purpose and the motivation of the killer. None of these clues is definitive, and most can be interpreted in more than one way. In movies of this kind, the viewer is usually provided with a fairly complete explanation by the end. No here; we just get an additional clue but not the final facts. This is what makes the movie so good.

I believe the key is given in the classes that Roberto is teaching to a select audience of law students. In one of these classes, Roberto discourses at length on a judges job: he/she must sift through evidence many times incomplete, contradictory or downright false and reach a verdict based on preponderance of evidence, even if some points are left unresolved. The viewer of this movie is being asked to do the same job, without expecting complete understanding of all points. It should be noted that Argentina did not have trials by jury until the beginning of 2015, thus theatrics are not of the essence here.

Ricardo Darn's performance is flawless; he has developed into one of the finest actors of his generation. Alberto Amman is equally excellent; he alternates subtly and almost imperceptibly between boyish charm and creepiness. Director Hernn Goldfrid hits all the right notes all the time; his pacing is perfect. Production values are excellent.

This movie is a must see. As a bonus, you'll get to know the magnificent building housing the School of Law of the University of Buenos Aires.",1437955200,4,1724,4.759197324414716
8602113,1,B00E6MNREE,"This is about the movie itself not the product. Spoiler: The lead character Darin decides based on one coincidence his student must be a killer, then spends the rest of the movie chasing his own tail. Worst part is, the ending made no sense and was open ended. Waste of 2 good hours.",1431820800,,283,4.3584905660377355

8602115,4,B00E6MNREE,"IT IS A GOOD PICTURES, BUT IT ISN'T RICADO DARIN BEST. THE PLOT IS VERY INTERESTING AND THE ACTING IS EXCELLENT, BUT DARIN IS A SUCH A GOOD ACTOR HIS PERFORMANCES ARE ALWAYS ENJOYABLE.",1399507200,,184,4.4411764705882355
8602116,4,B00E6MNREE,if you like the actor ricardo darin and  intelligent  thrillers this is  an entertaining film that should  get an american distributor,1398729600,,134,5.238095238095238
8602117,3,B00E6MNREE,"Roberto Bermdez (Ricardo Darn, The Secret in Their Eyes) is a former lawyer currently teaching criminal law in law school. One day a young woman is brutally murdered at the schools parking lot, and because of the circumstances surrounding her death Roberto is convinced that one of his students named Gonzalo (Alberto Ammann) killed her. Roberto starts investigation alone, finding clues through his old connections, but will he ever discover the truth?

A 2013 Argentine thriller Thesis on a Homicide (Tesis sobre un homicidio) has a story about a murder, but the films director Hernn Goldfrid seems more interested in exploring the character of Roberto and his obsession, than in the process of uncovering the mystery. Is Roberto doing this in order to impress his ex-wife, to whom he is obviously attracted? Does he really know what he is doing? In a sense this is a character study, reminiscent of Francis Ford Coppolas psychological thriller The Conversation.

That is fine, but here is a problem. In his class Roberto says what matters is details (one of his character traits), but while the film spends so much time showing these details Roberto sees (and there are so many of them), the film fails to present them in the way that really interests the viewer. There are so many coincidences that happen in the story, and some of the events that take place in the story are not believable, physically and psychologically.

After the slow-paced one hour the film finally picks up, but despite the fine performance from the star Ricardo Darn the film fails to fulfil its potential.",1393632000,,1585,4.928838951310861
8602118,4,B00E6MNREE,"Ricardo Darin is one of the best actors in Argentina and would also be so in America if he chose to make movies here.  In this movie he plays a lawyer, somewhat over the hill, who now teaches in a law school.  After a girl is murdered in front of the school he comes to believe that the killer is one of his law students and sets out to prove his thesis. Thus far this has the makings of Seven Queens or the Secret of their Eyes,but the movie falls short of greatness.  The ending is confused-perhaps deliberately.  While this falls short of many of his other films, he delivers a fine performance and the movie is certainly worth watching.",1388880000,,640,4.308333333333334
