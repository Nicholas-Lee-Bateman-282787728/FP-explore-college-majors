2658791,5,B000ILYYU8,"The pilates are very challenging; however, I found her step workout to borrow a lot from Jane Fonda's classic step of 10+ years ago.  Fun DVD though.",1173312000,2,149,4.518518518518518
8146051,1,B000ILYYU8,"Not much fun to do. Old and tired video. I usually love Kathy, but this one isn't my favorite.",1459987200,,94,4.0
8146052,5,B000ILYYU8,Shipped fast and so glad to find this. Used in the 80's and its still the best work out out there,1437868800,,97,3.6666666666666665
8146053,4,B000ILYYU8,"I've been using this workout for years.  So long that I wore out the DVD, and now had to buy a replacement.  The step workout always brings me up to a good sweat, and the pilates do wonders for keeping my body flexible.",1435276800,,219,4.069767441860465
8146054,5,B000ILYYU8,"I love this Kathy Smith Pilates DVD. I've tried several, and I always go back to this one! I think especially if you are a newbie, wanting to see what it's all about, or even wanting to try yoga for the first time, this is the perfect one to try! The tummy trimming workout is my favorite!",1411430400,,289,4.087719298245614
8146055,5,B000ILYYU8,"This is the kind of pilates I like - not yoga, not isolated body parts. Kathy makes sure you focus on the ""powerhouse,"" the core of your body, which is what J. Pilates was known for. I love this DVD so much that when I lost my first copy in a move, I ordered it again.",1369612800,,268,3.8035714285714284
8146056,4,B000ILYYU8,"This DVD is MUCH BETTER than her Peel off the Pounds Pilates DVD. This one is true to title and much easier than Mari Winsor. On a side note I was a little distracted by how hideous Kathy Smith's feet look in this DVD. I think she definately should have sprang for a pedicure prior to doing this. She has old lady wrinkley feet. However, she takes time to explain everything clearly and unlike Mari actually does the exercises she expects you to do. I felt like I got a pretty good light day workout.",1267056000,4,500,4.273684210526316
8146057,4,B000ILYYU8,This is a great DVD for beginners like me. I'm enjoying it a lot and trying to keep using it 2-3 times week.,1262995200,,108,3.739130434782609
8146058,3,B000ILYYU8,it's okay to workout with this video if your just beggining or maybe intermediate.this workout is definately is not for the advanced.,1261785600,,133,5.090909090909091
8146059,5,B000ILYYU8,"First of all, you get three workouts in one, two for  Pilates and one step with weights workout.  The Pilates workouts are effective and Kathy Smith instructs on how to acquire good form in executing Pilates moves.  The Pilates workouts can be done back to back for those seeking a greater challenge.  The Fat Burning Breakthrough workout has sections that can be worked out all at once or from one day to the next.  The step choreography is more dancey and slightly  more complex than the Gin Miller Reebok videos. As for borrowing moves from Jane Fonda, Step workouts are composed of steps that are called out in a sequence and many of the basic moves have standard names. No one owns these names or moves, otherwise Gin Miller should be paid handsomely since she created Step workouts in the first place. Try the dvd it's a bargain!!",1242259200,5,836,4.614864864864865
8146060,5,B000ILYYU8,"First of all, you get three workouts in one, two for Pilates and one step with weights workout.

The Pilates workouts can be done back to back for those seeking a greater challenge. The Pilates Abs portion took Kathy a lot of explaining to execute the moves, which helped me immensely, especially in the lowest part of the abs, which was intense!!. The lower body Pilates workout was more intense on those parts of the body and briefly reviewed the Abs portion.  All in all, both of the Pilates sections are safe and quietly intense workouts.

The Fat Burning Breakthrough is a step workout that is done in two waves with two weight training section between and in the end of the step waves, with crunches and pushups. This  DVD section made me sweat a ton. I suggest that everyone review the steps beforehand, because you will find yourself pausing and rewinding portions because the camera shifts around in the tougher parts. The Fat Burning Breakthrough workout has sections that can be worked out all at once or from one day to the next. The step choreography is more dancey and slightly more complex than the Gin Miller Reebok videos.

All in all, I'm very happy with my purchase. Try the dvd it's a bargain!!",1219881600,8,1214,4.627906976744186
