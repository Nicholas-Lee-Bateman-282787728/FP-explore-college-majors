8336772,5,B001QWQJB0,"This movie was absolutely fantastic. It had me at my seat every second, with such intricately designed characters and a strong plotline. Their cunning and decisive words against this monstrous foe left me with wanting a sequel!

The special effects aren't a joke, either. At times, I couldn't even distinguish fact from fake, and for seconds I thought the actors were in danger.

Overall, I can't express how enjoyable this movie was... other than saying that it easily should have had Jennifer Lawrence involved, just to compete her skills.",1415059200,,541,5.067415730337078
8336773,3,B001QWQJB0,"This movie delivers a decent portrayal of the Psychopathic mind set and provides a fair amount of tension. It is a low budget production but it is a REAL movie. If you are looking for slick production and academy award performances, this isn't the movie for you. It is a in your face type of movie and pulls no punches. A slow burner it is not! The plot is simple, 2 twisted women hating madmen come to terrorize and murder a group of friends having a reunion party. It is a realistic situation that could happen to anyone. It is based on true events,and is a reminder to make every moment in life count because one never knows when death will come kncoking.",1373587200,,658,4.357723577235772
8336774,1,B001QWQJB0,"Possibly the worst attempt at a movie I have ever seen. Must have been filmed by ten-year olds with a camcorder.
Had to turn it off after 20 minutes.
Unfortunately, our dog ate the rental, so now I'm forced to buy a replacement. Definite waste of money...",1249171200,2,255,4.446808510638298
8336775,1,B001QWQJB0,"I Rented this movie, from the cover it looks like a real movie, but from the first few seconds something doesnt seem right and after only a couple minutes into it you realize it is not a real production. It is of the same quality of maybe a couple middle school to high schoolers with a mid range home movie camera. im not saying this is a BAD movie i have seen Bad movies that are actual productions, i am saying this is not even a REAL movie. maybe this is  a new scam, some guys walk around filming a movie as they go with a handi cam slap a proffesional cover on the box and try to make a few quick bucks. This is the first ive seen of its kind. I repeat this is not a real movie.",1242086400,4,684,3.8857142857142857
