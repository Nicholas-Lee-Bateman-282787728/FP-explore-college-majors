903398,5,6304571542,"Not as 'heavy' and full of action as many of Woo's other early films such as The Killer, Hardboiled, A Better Tommorrow etc. A bit of a change of pace for Woo and well done. Three street kids pull off a big heist.

Woo remade this film for TV with disastoruous results so make sure you are buying the one starring Chow Yun Fat.",1098489600,2,327,4.109375
903399,3,6304571542,"After the emotional wreck of a masterpiece that was Bullet in the Head, director John Woo rightfully felt the need to loosen up.  Hence this fluffy, downright silly, often enjoyable caper movie that merges the casts of The Killer (Chow Yun-fat, Kenneth Tsang, Chu Kong) and A Better Tomorrow (Leslie Cheung) while carving out a broad comedic tone that harkens back to Woo's older, lowbrow slapsticks (Plain Jane to the Rescue, From Riches to Rags).
Chow Yun-fat has a field day in this film, hamming it up as ""Cupcake/Joey"" (depending on your translation), a master burglar who becomes wheelchair-bound in a job gone wrong.  Some of the gags are quite forced, but when Chow is given a chance for physical comedy in the wheelchair, he's a lot of fun.  Leslie Cheung anchors the film as the acrobatic Jim, who is both Chow's best friend and his closest competitor for the affection of ""Red Bean/Cherie"", their sister-in-crime.  Kenneth Tsang's character is pretty ridiculous, though the veteran actor does his best, but the surprise delight is seeing Chu Kong, so deadly serious in The Killer, loosen up to play a kindly but none too bright cop who takes the three young people in as proteges.  Woo's action choreography is dazzling as ever, and far less violent than his usual works (though still pretty high in body count compared with American action-comedies), and the best set pieces of this film (the card-throwing punk, the centerpiece second heist featuring a lot of explosives) are high entertainment.
This DVD edition has been out for some time and it took me this long to check it out -- the packaging just doesn't inspire confidence.  The contents herein partially affirm this suspicion.  The transfer is clean, and it's great that they included the Cantonese dialogue track as an audio option.  But there's something wrong with the sound mix; the music is far too loud, often drowning out the Cantonese dialogue, and I know from an old VHS copy of this film I own that the original sound mix didn't have this problem.  There are also nearly no bonus materials, just trailers.  It's probably harder to find bonus materials for Hong Kong films, and perhaps it's unfair to compare this to the multitude of features on the Criterion releases of The Killer and Hard-Boiled, but nonetheless, the special materials are out there in the vaults.  Later UK releases of Hard-Boiled and The Killer do have added materials for us to peruse.  So it's a matter of hunting it down and including it.
An adequate DVD for a problematic but mostly enjoyable film.",1079740800,5,2554,4.859447004608295
903400,5,6304571542,"Director John Woo (""A Better Tomorrow"", ""M:I2"") contributes a lot to the success of Chow Yun-Fat (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""A Better Tomorrow"", ""Hard-Boiled Cop"") and Leslie Cheung (""Rouge"", ""A Better Tomorrow"", ""God of Guns"") - one of the best acting pairs ever seen in the cinematic industry.
Pierce Brosnan's ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" was an attempt to completely copy John Woo's ""Once A Thief"", which completely succeeded in being creative, original, and with just the right amount of action. Unpredictable, and with some comic relief, the plot is highly original. (That is, until ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" brutally tried to copy it lately.)The technology used in the movie itself is a reason to buy ""Once A Thief"" - it's highly impressive.
One of Chow Yun Fat and Leslie Cheung's best performances. Must-buy. - Priscilla",993686400,5,834,5.185185185185185
903401,4,6304571542,"This is a definite change from the usual John Woo movies.  It's a very light-hearted, comedic movie with a pinch of romance and of course action sequences.  Chow Yun Fatt, Leslie Chueng and Cherie Chung are all wonderful in the movie, but it is Chow Yun Fatt who steals most of the scenes.  The 3 have a great comradery and the viewer is let in on how their relationships are interwoven with flashbacks.  The movie plot is one that is familiar and similar to the better known American version of the movie, but John Woo has made this his own with the addition of a splendid sub-plot and twist at the end. A very good fun movie, will leave you light-hearted and smiling at the end of it.",987811200,6,686,4.3359375
903402,4,6304571542,"The violence is toned down (no bloody gun battles here) and the story is not as dire as other films by this director/producer but the film still is very good. The action sequences are well choreographed and everything still has that ""Woo touch"".",987724800,2,245,4.72093023255814
903403,2,6304571542,"Despite its action-packed storyline with romance, violence, burglary, cross-culture scenary, it just didn't deliver. I got bored 3/4 of the movie and never bothered to finish it. ""Cherry"" actually annoyed me. I only got this movie because of I'm a fan of Leslie Cheung; he served as the main eyecandy. The american version of Entrapment with Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta Jones is so much better.",985824000,,398,5.045454545454546
903404,4,6304571542,"This movie didn't seem to know what kind of genre of movie it wanted to become.  It started as a action thriller movie but gradually, it started to wander into a slapstick comedy.  The plots were rather forgettable & at times, out of this world but the breathtaking scenes taken in Paris & Cannes, performances by those 3 main stars with solid supporting actors definitely worth the while to relive the magic of HK movie making.  This movie enabled you to catch a glimpse of the other side of Chow Yuen Fatt ie. being funny.  His versatility is what made him an international star today.  If memory serves me rite, this would be Cherry's final movie before she was married to a businessman.  How I wish she could stay longer in the movie industry as her performance was always a breath of fresh air aka. refreshing.  Leslie Cheung hadn't come out of age then but his talent definitely showed thru.  Highly recommended for a John Woo fan.",978739200,6,937,4.568862275449102
903405,5,6304571542,"If you like John Woo, this is one movie you don't want to miss!
This movie is packed with John Woo's classic action, romance humor and cleverness.  The story line is simple enough that you don't have to read the subtitles; just sit back and enjoy the actions and jokes.
The cast is another excellent choice of Woo! Teaming up Yun-Fat (as Joe) the cool, heroic figure and Leslie Cheung (as Jim) the pretty, cleaver boy, plus Cherie Chung (as Cherie the cute girl next door, you got endless action and fun!
As to all of my friends, I highly recommend this movie to you!",977270400,2,567,4.4
903406,5,6304571542,"Those of you expecting a John Woo shoot-'em-up will be disappointed, because this is a heist film and a comedy. But it's also very good on every  one of these respects and ranks up there as one of my favorite Woo films.  The comedy is playful, the film is full of Woo stylings and Chow Yun-Fat  turns in a masterfully complex performance. Quite frankly, anyone willing  to be open-minded about what they get from Woo and Chow should love this  movie -- those of you who just want to see ""The Killer"" and  ""Hard Boiled"" done over and over again can look elsewhere. Woo's  more versatile than you can handle, apparently.",965433600,,618,4.513513513513513

7875037,4,6304571542,"Once a Thief is an action packed comedic caper that really is an absolute blast to watch! I only give it a 4 out of 5 because its overly comedic moments and silly plot holes prevent it from being an amazing action film. However, I say this with the most respect possible, because this is an insanely funny and exciting heist film. Chow Yun Fat is as funny as ever with his insane amount of charisma! The film has some great action as well! The middle car chase and the final shootout are the two standout gun battles. Really, if you enjoyed The Killer, Hard Boiled, A Better Tomorrow, or Bullet in the Head, you owe it to yourself to watch this. It's those movies but with a lighter side to things. People still die and stakes are still high, but reality goes out the door and goofy John Woo comes into play for a few scenes of the film.",1364774400,,837,4.2375
7875038,4,6304571542,"This isn't your run of the mill action comedy.  The fact that John Wo's name is on it tells you there's lots of violence, but it makes the show more exciting to see all the gunfighting.  I thought it was great.  This is probably my favorite Chow Yun-Fat movie.  Amazing, as always.  He kind of reminds me of an Asian Cary Grant in this show.  I'd tell you more, but this is the kind of movie that's ruined if you know too much.  See it for yourself.  Grab some popcorn and sit back and enjoy the wild ride.",1276300800,,506,4.091836734693878
7875039,5,6304571542,"This movie is not what I expected at all.  Rather than the usual Chow Yun Fat/John Woo Kill everything and then some movie, I was pleasantly surprised to watch this fun and seet movie.  The premise is very 70s caper movie, a heist, a plan, a bad guy and the players.  However, Woo takes us on a long journey with some unsuspecting turns and twists that I did not expect.  The effort was fun and effective.  Though some of the humor towards the end has a prediliction for cheesy humor, it's easy to get past and enjoy a very fun and entertaining romp.  Recomended.",1177718400,,563,4.365384615384615
7875040,4,6304571542,It is not woo's best work I will say that but it is not bad. It is more comedy than the ulta violent action gun-ho stuff that we are all use to see. But the fact that he took a different aproach for this film was in alot of ways refreshing. The humor at times can be a tad bit corny at times and the action is very restrained. Out of respect for the man that has given us the greatest action movies of our time I will say get this movie. Not everyone will like this movie but some will just don't get your hopes high.,1161734400,,517,3.8411214953271027
7875041,1,6304571542,"Ok, a John Woo film, starring Chow Yun Fat, about an art heist.  It's all good right?  Wrong.  Oh, was it bad.  Slapstick, some terribly contrived stunts and a cringingly bad soundtrack.  We did finish it--but we still wonder why.",1135036800,,230,4.65
7875042,5,6304571542,"The film starts out breezy enough.  Likable trio of art thiefs mastermind elaborate heists in Paris.  Afterwards they toast their laurels and have a jolly good time.  You almost forget you're watching a John Woo film.  Never fear.  Guns start ablazing.  Things blow up real good.  Bad guys eat lead.  It's soon revealed that Joey(Chow Yun-Fat), Jim (Leslie Cheung), and Cherie(Cherie Leung) were raised by an evil father figure who taught them petty thievery at the threat of a caning or starvation.  The three grow up to be master criminals employed by evil Daddy's thriving Hong Kong crime syndicate.  Heavy stuff but Woo is in top form here juggling thrills and levity along with the film's darker themes.  The film also contains enough clever twists and surprises to satisfy the more discerning viewer.  Yun-Fat is in top form here as the devil-may-care Joey.  Yun-Fat commands the screen as both comedian and action star.  This may not be the equivalent of Woo's masterworks, ""The Killer"" and ""Hard Boiled"", but it is an impressive entry in the directors canon.",1133740800,2,1066,4.9491525423728815
