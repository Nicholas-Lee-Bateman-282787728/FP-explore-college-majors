1880022,5,B000096IBT,"""Tears of the Sun"" is being wrongly marketed as an action film. Truth be told, there is barely a shot fired till the last half hour, but that doesn't stop Antoine Fuqua's new film from being entertaining.
Entertainment probably isn't the right word though, because some of the images in this film will make your heart sink. The brutality of village cleansing is shown in it's entirety, and it's totally gut wrenching. The sight of innocent women and children being murdered is unholy, yet it's impossible not to watch, because Fuqua wants us to watch and understand it.
As for the final half hour, it just adds intense action the emotion. Even though you can barely hear anything but the bullets wizzing by, the emotion remains, and makes it all the more realistic.
In short, ""Tears of the Sun"" is a triumph for both Fuqua and Bruce Willis, who is incredible in the lead role.",1046995200,4,876,4.658064516129032
1880023,4,B000096IBT,"About time Bruce decided to take a good script and make it an even better movie. Willis plays wily veteran Navy SEAL A.K. Waters, who is sent in to Nigeria to extricate an American Dr.(Bellucci) from a highly contentious area overrun by a relentless band of armed rebels. After a few less than great flicks by Willis, I can attest that Bruce is finally back - with a vengeance.
Monica Bellucci, a former runway model as well as the star of the upcoming Matrix sequel, is a bona fide hottie and steals the screen when given the opportunity.  Tears of the Sun is Bruce at his best - killing the bad guys and saving a hot chick. Good stuff.",1046822400,2,637,4.352941176470588

1880043,1,B000096IBT,"I used to love this movie, but watching it again, in comparison to other military movies, such as American Sniper, it's pathetic.  So unrealistic, the acting is terrible - none of the ""Seals"" even know how to properly hold a weapon.  And when he turned the helo around just to save some random people in a village, I had to turn it off.  That would never happen, ever.  The Lt would face serious consequences for placing the lives of so many American at risk to save Nigerian villagers.  I guess it's a good movie if you're not particularly into the military genre and are just looking for entertainment, but if you know anything about the military you'll spot so many flaws that you won't be able to take it seriously.",1487721600,,719,4.5

As the story develops, he is faced with a quandary whether to follow orders and complete his mission or save a number of African villagers which means disregard his orders.",1475280000,3,517,4.808988764044944

1880100,5,B000096IBT,"I agree wholeheartedly with the previous reviewers; this is my favorite war movie. What amazed me most and drew me to this movie is the fact that they named real countries, such as Nigeria and Cameroon (instead of made up fictional African countries) and depicted realistic acts of atrocities. Bruce Willis was perfectly cast as the thoroughly professional team leader who decided to follow his conscience and do something about the slaughter of innocents simply because he could make a difference. The action is gritty, there is no sentimentality and the audience is left to feel outrage at the incomprehensible evil of the rebels without undue prodding on the part of the actors. Indeed, these men were heroes for attempting to do what they were never asked to do.",1468800000,,766,4.945736434108527

The only reason I bough this film is that it is directed by Antoine Fuqua.
Because I bought the DVD, I watched it for the second time.
I watched with the positive mind, but sadly it was a total failure.
Patriotic film is not always bad.
Our country is good and we do good things to other people. Why bad?
But this film was too obvious that they wanted to show that USA is a good country and we soidiers are all good people.
I know that they are. But sometimes if it is so clear that they want to show nothing but that, it makes us boring.

1880209,5,B000096IBT,"Tears Of The Sun (The Directors Cut) is an outstanding Special Forces movie. The Directors Cut is vastly superior to the theatrical release because it's a more balanced, complete and satisfying story, the character development is better and it has a solid moral center.
In my opinion there are only a handful of good Special Forces movies. These include Black Hawk Down, Bravo Two Zero, Lone Survivor, 84 Charlie Mopic and Special Forces (the French movie). Black Hawk Down and Lone Survivor although entertaining are deeply flawed as the actual events that the movies are based on have been radically changed to create a more satisfying movie experience (primarily for American audiences).
Tears Of The Sun (the Directors Cut) is arguably one of the best because it makes no pretense about being based on true events. It's a great story, with good believable acting, solid direction and a great soundtrack. Highly recommended!",1440028800,,927,5.105263157894737

1880227,5,B000096IBT,"A totally implausible situation is created to make for a fine Bruce Willis action feature. lots of great combat action as a team of US SEALS led by Bruce Willis tries to save a group of missionaries from some rebels in deep, dark Africa.

He is ordered to only take the foreigners out but disobeys orders and takes a bunch of indigenous refugees with him. They are then chased across the country by the rebels.

For some reason the only son of the former president who was killed by the rebels is with the group which appears to be why the rebels are chasing them.

None of this makes all that much sense other than as a vehicle for another fine Bruce Willis shoot-em-up, and that part of the movie is downright good.",1434240000,,717,4.37593984962406

1880254,4,B000096IBT,"Very cool movie about the Navy Seals and their heroic adventures, and efforts in war torn Central Africa.  Bruce Willis plays a daring Lieutenant leading a team of mostly enlisted Sailors (who have nerves of steel) on a rescue mission to find and save an Italian female doctor.  These daring warriors engage some of the worst radical Terrorist and guerilla fighter scum on face of the Earth, with some very well acted stunt work and action scenes.

  I really liked this movie and think it's right up there with ""Black Hawk Down"", ""Lone Survivor"", ""American Sniper"", ""Zero Dark Thirty"", and a number of other military themed and all American kick A$$ movies.  Willis always plays the military man's role excellently. It seems to me as if the actor had been made for the part, very convincing.

 Thumbs up and B+ for ""Tears of the Sun"".",1430265600,,835,4.710344827586207

1880256,5,B000096IBT,"Tears of the Sun begins with a dreadful exposition of a horrible reality in Africa. The chief message of this film is to intervene for a better world, and for a better humanity. The American soldiers in this movie, whom were sent for a short mission to save an American doctor, went through a radical human transformation which jeopardized their mission. Not to be engaged in a war where ethnic cleansing took place right in front of their eyes was inevitable. The viewer is yearning for justice through the American soldiers. But the more human that the American soldiers became, the more susceptible that they turned to be, and subsequently the bigger chance that they were to die in combat. In order to save the refugees and complete their mission they had to make a sacrifice. However, when the American eagle finally swooped down on the hostile Nigerian forces, through a massive, crushing and pounding firepower, poetic justice prevailed and catharsis appeased the viewer. The end made American heroism at its best. This film was also very emotional and filled with suspense and scruples. The African music was very emotive, and the acting was superb. This film is one of the best action war films Ive seen this year.",1428883200,,1223,4.856459330143541

I really enjoyed it and I was particularly happy to see Bruce Willis come back with a good action packed adventure. Willis had these roles down to a science. It's some of what he does best. It's a non-stop shoot em up adrenaline rush. The action looks realistic and so does the gritty splattering of carnage.
Yet, there is a deeper side to this film of human suffering and heroics where the humanity shines through what could have been just another action film. The images are powerful and I found Bruce Willis' performance one of his most sincere for a film in this genre. Each subsequent time I see this film it just seems better. The emotionally charged impact is devastating.",1414627200,,863,4.574193548387097

1880352,2,B000096IBT,"OK so I was in the mood for a good action movie with perhaps a good message but ... no ... that ain't what this is. Lots of really horrifying scenes of violence against women and children; Bruce Willis and his troupes trying to do the right thing; the main Dr. character I found extremely annoying (they really needed to get that lipstick off her face! really? nice make-up on a refuges in the jungle?) and I just didn't care for her acting. And where was the action? I kept waiting ... and waiting ... yes, there was a good scene where they were sniping the bad guys but I gave up after about 3/4 of the way through this one..

So -- not a good action movie. Not really a plot that I can see except that mercenaries and political bad guys are ... well, bad  .It may have been an attempt to raise awareness of the Nigerian civil wars but it was heavy-handed and unnecessarily gory and just didn't pull me into the characters or the story.

1880366,5,B000096IBT,"I've seen this movie three times now, and it's a favorite. Not because of the subject-matter because that itself is horrifying, but because of the underlying message. Did they 100% accurately portray military tactics and decisions--I'm not knowledgeable enough to comment on that. I do know I watched it with someone who's served two tours and he said that with the exception of a few things, they were fairly accurate for a Hollywood movie. Did they accurately portray the conflict in Nigeria? I know a little of what goes on in those countries because of friends who do work over there, but I also know that some of it has been exaggerated . . . at least in part for present day.
I believe they were trying to convey conflict that has and does exist in many countries around the world. It's not a movie meant to be ""loved"" or even to be in awe of.

There's a lot of internal conflict for the characters, and that is one of the most important aspects of the movie. The message is clear, powerful, and obvious, and that is the point. As for the superficial stuff, all of the actors are excellent in their roles, the photography is beautiful, the drama is powerful. It's Hollywood, so they're going to take some liberties, and that should be expected. There aren't overdone special effects that make no sense (sure, they're going to make things go boom). If you watch this movie with those things in mind, you just might be able to understand what they were trying to do (aside from just creating an action flick). It's not for the faint of heart or the overly critical, but in my opinion, it's worth watching.",1404259200,2,1609,4.548275862068966
1880367,5,B000096IBT,"I am a good fan of action movies, I always have been since I was a little kid, but as I got older and I REALLY started actually watching the movies, I had a problem with all of them, they all had unrealistic combat, like The Expendables and Battle: Los Angeles, although I thought these movies were great, the action was unrealistic, however, in this movie, the action is completely realistic, and I love that about this movie, there aren't many action movies that have truly realistic violence and combat, except a few.

In addition, there is something about this movie that I think makes it stand out to all the other action movies, and that is the level of emotion involved in this movie, to me, in order for me to really love a movie, or anything with a plot, something really bad has to happen, otherwise, I will think it's boring, this movie does a good job with that, this movie has an excellent plot that is shown with an excellent (what I call in literature) narrative arc. This narrative arc is backed up by the emotion in the movie, and I (especially when emotionally provoked) am an emotionally hardened person when it comes to action movies, but after watching this movie, I was in tears, and (as I say in my other reviews), I was emotionally compelled, and this is unlike any movie I have ever seen before.

1880416,5,B000096IBT,"I might not have written a review given all the great ones on here, but after seeing this movie again recently, I remember when it came out.  It is action at its finest, and an emotionally vivid and haunting depiction of the absoute horrors of genocide and tribal warfare in Africa, and the immense bravery of the American Seals who made the conscious decision to disobey orders and try to save these African refugees from such horrors.  I have read all the cynical comments about patriotic jingoism and other such criticisms, about simplistic depictions of good and evil, and I simply find those comments worthless and borne of pseudo intellectual babble, from persons who are well aware that the daggers of the pen that they hurl are from the comfort of their couch or from the desk behind which they sit, in the confines of their safe sanctuary at here in America.  All while our soldiers sacrifice everything so that we may be so comfortably clothed and housed, and while people of other nations suffer unimaginably from the horrors of tyrants and warlords.

Antoine Fuqua, one of my favorite esteemed directors (who is also African American- hero in my opinion), has put together an epic adventure for the ages in Tears of the Sun.  But he has also created a timeless tale of the struggle of good against evil.  You just never expected it to grab on to your heart the way it does, and not let go.  And let go, it does not.  You will feel each death in this movie, of both the refugees, and one or more of the brave seals, and you will hurt inside, because you know instinctively that saving lives comes with an enormous cost in both human terms and otherwise, and it is much too much to bear, although it must be borne, as we instinctively understand, by the bravest among us.

Top 20 action film all time, and top 100 movie ever made in my opinion.  May Mr. Fuqua make 20 films like this.  Thanks for reading.",1386547200,,1915,4.521739130434782

We know what is going to happen; however the story is on how it plays out.

If you buy the DVD do not over look the two voice over commentaries as they add to the experience. Then watch the film again and see what you missed.

As a rule I usually avoid this kind of movie as we know the end and the travel time thought the story is mostly blood and guts; in this film it is verging on gratuitous.

Tears of the Sun tells the fictional story of a team of elite Navy SEALs led by LT Waters (Bruce Willis), which is sent into war-torn Nigeria to rescue an American doctor (Monica Bellucci).  The doctor refuses to abandon the people to the new ruthless military regime, and so the team tries to escort them to neighboring Cameroon.  Along the way they encounter the horrors of ethnic ""cleansing,"" before the inevitable showdown at the end.

As much as it is cool to watch a group of men portraying SEALs in a relatively realistic fashion, the basic plot is implausible.  There is no way that a true SEAL leader would get sentimental and throw his orders to the wind.  If you can suspend your disbelief on that plot point, then you might enjoy this movie.  Military types will likely groan, however.

The video quality of the Blu-ray, while not the best I have ever seen, is nevertheless quite good.  Sharp details and little film grain, even though much of the movie occurs in overcast or lowlight conditions.  Greens and blacks are strong, causing certain colors, such as yellow, to really pop.  The sound was also good, especially during the battle scenes.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, it is worth it.

Despite my misgivings about the key plot point, I still recommend this movie for some good action and to highlight some of the tragedy that can occur on the African continent.",1382313600,,1556,4.607272727272727

I really enjoyed it and I was particularly happy to see Bruce Willis come back with a good action packed adventure. Willis had these roles down to a science. It's some of what he does best. It's a non-stop shoot em up adrenaline rush. The action looks realistic and so does the gritty splattering of carnage. Yet, there is a deeper side to this film of human suffering and heroics where the humanity shines through what could have been just another action film. The images are powerful and I found Bruce Willis' performance one of his most sincere for a film in this genre. Each subsequent time I see this film it just seems better. The emotionally charged impact is devastating. Yes, their is a gritty splattering of carnage, but the voice humanity cries out much louder than the roar of gunfire.",1379289600,,988,4.556179775280899

1880433,4,B000096IBT,"Antoine Fuqua has been on a roll. With the classic bad cop/good cop flick, Training Day and the more than memorable, Shooter. Then this film which comes very close to the stature of ""classic"". Fuqua is truly a visionary director. I have seen Tears of the Sun 6 times now, and each time I see it I like it more and more. Bruce Willis was absolutely perfect in this role of a tough hearted navy seal commander. He and his team of highly trained men are sent on classified missions by the government. They return from one mission(the facts of which are never revieled) and are enmediately sent back out- this time to a make shift mission/hospital in Africa to rescue a priest, 2 nuns, and the central objective- a female doctor named kendricks. Willis and team learn that there is a militia of rebels sweeping the country performing ethnic cleansing. who rape, dismember, burn and kill anyone who doesn't have the same beliefs they do. Willis and his team must rescue the doctor as the primary objective, but she nor the other workers want to leave the refugees behind and refuse to leave. So deception is used to make her believe that the team will take all those in the mission and deliver them to safety in Camaroon. Willis plays a man who is robotic, tough, and with little or no feelings, and so he plans to leave the refugees stranded and rescue only Kendricks as ordered. But after he witnesses a terrible event from a hellicopter, he and his team return to the refugees and decide to guide them to safety through many miles of jungle while being persued by over 1000 rebels (He and his men number less than 7 or 8). Antoine Fuqua creates a stylish, explosive and exciting adventure story here packed full of heart pounding detail, beautiful photography, wonderful score, and plenty of action. I was enormously impressed with this film. It's one of those movies that is so good you might feel compelled to see it more than once. I know I was.

1880464,4,B000096IBT,"I initially became interested in this film because it was reviewed and recommended on ChurchMilitant.tv as a picture that positively portrays the Catholic Church (rare in today's mainstream media) and because it has an interesting, action-filled story line. Admittedly, it was not the best action movie I've ever seen. The action tended to be of a slower pace. The movie was more about the selflessness of the heroes than about wow-ing the audience with car chases or shoot-em-up fight scenes, though there are a some of those.

My favorite aspect of the film is the true-to-life portrayal of the heart of a military man in Bruce Willis's character. I have had the privilege of knowing a fair number of military officers, and their kind and generous spirits coupled with their unwavering readiness to give their lives for the good and the beautiful is one of the greatest inspirations in my life. I was glad to see these qualities of the best-of-the-best military man portrayed in the movie. Most people never know about the sacrifices these men make and it was refreshing to see it portrayed in a beautifully and faithfully written film.

I would recommend this picture to anyone who wants to know the noble heart of a military man, to anyone who wants to see the courage and total abandonment of self of Catholic missionaries in the field, and to anyone who wants a great action movie that has a plot with substance and intellectually-satisfying dimension.",1361664000,2,1458,4.898785425101215

1880469,4,B000096IBT,"There is a layer of generic genre film that lays over the film, and yet it is largely forgivable thanks to a riveting score, complex character development and some lush scenery.  Bruce Willis is an actor I consider underrated, for his talent certainly rubs deeper than his celebrity despite how the media may see it.  I'll always seek out a film bearing his name, and I'm usually pleased with the outcome.

`Tears of the Sun' is no exception.

The film centers on a Navy Seal (played by Willis) who ventures into the Nigerian jungle with a Special Ops team to rescue an American doctor (played by Bellucci) and the nuns and priest helping her.  Almost immediately a morality issue is addressed and the journey to safety becomes a lot more difficult than initially expected.

Fuqua displays the same passion here as he did with `Training Day', delivering searing intensity when needed.  Willis is in top form, and Bellucci is marvelously compelling here.  The cinematography is breathtaking, and the overall construction of the film help lessen the looming reality that generalizations are being used here.  This is nowhere near as offensive as `Blood Diamond', but the reality of the weighty subject is lost in some of the testosterone.  Still, I was pleasantly surprised with how well most of this worked, and I'm sure many of you will as well.",1354579200,,1345,4.859649122807017

1880472,5,B000096IBT,"I watched the 1993 and fictional Bruce Willis movie, ""Tears of the Sun"", again today.  I've always liked it since it is about US Navy SEALs sent into Nigeria during a civil war to rescue an American missionary doctor there.  As a former Green Beret, this type of movie is right up my alley, and the very kind of mission we trained for and were likely to get.  This second time around, however, I watched it a bit more critically and discovered that I liked it even more.  I liked that the SEAL team looked pretty real, and that their equipment seemed correct for the time period.  I liked that their tactics were often correct and that they executed some small unit maneuvers exactly as we practiced them.  They were even given very specific, and difficult, rules of engagement just like we found ourselves bound to on real missions.  In fact, the conflict in the story--in spite of all the shooting and killing--was actually based upon the concept of ""man against himself.""  That is, Bruce Willis, as the commander of the team, has to decide when the rules of engagement should be disregarded in order to protect the greater good.  His mission is limited to rescuing the physician, but the doctor refuses to leave the Nigerian people she loves and works with.  This, combined with the terrible brutality arising from ethnic hatreds they all face, forces Willis's character to wrestle with the decision of whether or not to try and get everyone to safety in bordering Cameroon.  I won't spoil the outcome if you haven't seen it yet.

Here's the rub, however.  I looked into the film reviews and it turns out that ""Tears of the Sun"" was pretty much panned by the critics.  I guess the plot wasn't complicated enough for them.  They also didn't like the fact that it was set in Nigeria instead of a place like Rwanda where this type of war had recently occurred.  Roger Ebert gave it 3 out of 5 stars and Rotten Tomatoes didn't like it any better.  Why?  The action was good, in spite of a couple of very minor corny parts--not enough to pan the movie in my opinion.  I liked that some of the most telling moments (for me) were extremely understated in the film.  For example, one of the SEALs rushes back under fire to assist a civilian woman who is too terrified of the shooting to get up and run.  There is a split second that I had to rewind and pause the movie to see clearly, where the SEAL is retreating backward, firing at the oncoming enemy, and using his own body as a shield for her (see the photo).  This is exactly what I would expect of one of our elite warriors, but in the film you could easily miss it.  The SEALs pull off a very good ""banana peel"" maneuver in which the team forms a file under fire, and the last man closest to the enemy fires off all of his ammo and then runs to the other end of the file (the front).  The next man does the same, and then the next.  This helps keep a constant volley of fire going toward the enemy as the team attempts to move away or break contact.  It is a professional maneuver and indicated to me that the actors had some very real training provided to them.  After thinking about all this a bit, I felt that the movie didn't really need much more of a plot.  After all, the conflict with the rules of engagement the team faced in the story was complicated enough.

This is when it dawned on me (pardon the pun).  The typical movie going American will never face a moral conflict in which his safety, the safety of his colleagues, and his career (at the very least) is at great risk.  For people who generally don't worry about stealing a pen or two, or using the office LASER printer for personal stuff, or doing a little ""government work"" at the plant--all morally questionable, albeit minor--the conflict in this movie probably seems a bit lame.  For a society that generally believes abortion is wrong, but who would ""never tell other people not to do it"" this movie is just another Bruce Willis shoot'em up and nothing more.

In fact, the movie's greatest strengths lie in what mostly only people who are likely to face such a moral conflict would appreciate.  I never went into Africa to rescue anyone, but I was a leader in some pretty violent places while burdened with tough rules of engagement.  The pressure to go around them is sometimes overwhelming.  They are there for a reason though--oftentimes a good reason--and for the same reason that we focused so absolutely upon accomplishment of the mission.  They make this point subtly in the movie when Willis's character remarks early on that he isn't saving the doctor's life for the sake of the doctor, but merely to complete the mission he was given.  This is an important distinction because this absolute mission focus is what helps prevent something that many of you see happen every day in business projects all over the world.  We call it ""scope creep.""  It is a frustrating phenomenon in which new tasks and requirements are constantly added to an ongoing project until it becomes so big that it cannot possibly be accomplished in the assigned time and with the available resources.  Instead of a project, it becomes a job description.  Imagine the same thing happening to a small team on a dangerous military mission.  This is one reason why strict adherence to the mission and rules of engagement is so important.

Having said all this, when does it become appropriate to disregard the rules of engagement?  When does the military man allow the moral man inside him to take the lead?  When does the man have an opportunity to ""pay for his sins"" that resulted from strict adherence to the rules of engagement in the past?  This is the conflict that Willis's character faces and eventually decides, and this is why ""Tears of the Sun"" is one of my favorite films.  Unfortunately, a morally ambiguous and safe audience will not appreciate the deeper implications of this one.",1352073600,3,5900,4.5584045584045585

1880486,2,B000096IBT,"I served in the United State Navy on board ship and was not a Navy Seal, but even as a regular sailor I learned the critical nature of obedience to orders in combat situations. The movie was going OK until after completing the essential part of their mission the ""Seal"" team's leader decides to start improvising contrary to orders. The movie takes great liberties with naval procedures and creates a story of what Seals ought to do that would be consistent with civilian notions of right and wrong.

When the aged ""Special-Ops Commander,"" played by Bruce Willis starts essentially taking his orders from the lovely female doctor they're supposed to be rescuing it all goes downhill from there. It was difficult for me to accept the assumptions of the movie so I resented its efforts to manipulate my emotions. While there are a few exciting battle scenes, there is altogether too much civilian thinking going on in the minds of supposedly trained Navy Seals to feel authentic.

1880491,5,B000096IBT,"Central to any film is the crescendo, the buildup to the climactic scenes, the depth of character, dialogue, plot, and audience empathy; having said that, one dives into this military Rescue & Extraction drama and experiences the adrenlin rush. It is all or nothing once you accept the story's premise and become part of their mission. This is what happened to me with ""Tears Of The Sun"". Here was an A-grade Navy Seal movie with Monica Belluci in her own tour de force performance as a French doctor with an Italian accent and features; flat-on excellent portrayals of our 'head of the spear' warriors by seasoned character actors, who looked the part. The interaction between characters was textured, brilliant, dynamic, concise, with sharp military orders and asides - that heightened the danger and suspense.

This is a pointblank brutal classic on the order of ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""U-571"" that puts you directly in the battle at its worse moments. It deserves to be held apart from mediocre action movies because it embraces the suffering of innocent victims before and after two massacres within a military context; the decision by LT to disobey a direct order from his superior officer revolves clearly around two acts of genocide; we now have a moral decision made in the heat of battle by a classical hero who wants to bring his men home safe and sound; so he puts it to them directly, and they opt to stay on his altered mission, save as many innocents as possible, and face an overwhelming enemy force. ""Are we there yet?"" his RECON sergeant asks. It has all the attributes of a fine, honorable, realistic, and high-end depiction of our noble warriors. It elevates stark, unpretentious heroism to its rightful place in movie history. By the end of their mission, you accept their losses in the field and know that 'no one will be left behind.' A complete tragedy has been played out; you sit back and admire the courage and sacrifice of men who are called the 'head of the spear' and deserve our profound respect from afar and near at home.

Have purchased many copies of this film in VHS and DVD and given them out to combat troops, veterans, active duty personnel, and those who support our military. Highly recommend it for young men and women going into the military or those who love classic hell-bent war movies with no compromise to uphold. When we saw Navy Seals or Special Forces Operatives at the NCO Club on the INTEL base I was on, you would never ask them about their mission - you would be put on report for doing so.

1880497,5,B000096IBT,"Much of this film is pure and simple Hollywood, set in Africa with all of the Hollywood stereotypes about Africa (vicious rebels, crotchety foreign aid workers, wailing African mothers, etc.). Still, Tears of the Sun works because it is such an emotionally challenging journey. A small team of American commandos decides to try to protect refugees from a civil war in Nigeria. The acting amongst the main characters is generally OK, but the terror the African villagers convey is frighteningly realistic. What makes the film compelling is that they have to decide whether or not to disobey orders, who to save, and when to act. It's a violent movie with lots of fighting and depictions of massacres. However, if you can stomach it, the emotional catharsis at the end is one of the best I've seen in a long time.",1313712000,,811,4.8
1880498,4,B000096IBT,"A quip from Bruce Willis' character Lt. Waters as he leaves a missionary run by a French priest and his wife. Africa,often referred to as the ""dark"" continent,while not literally true,certainly is so figuratively speaking. It has seen so much unrest and brutal bloodshed over the past untold decades with rebels fighting governments,tribes fighting tribes and warfare on a genocidal scale. Tears of the Sun(released Mar/03),produced by Bruce Willis' own company,lifts back a small curtain and gives us a look into this world.
The plot involves Lt Waters and his small squad of Navy seals aboard an aircraft carrier,""somewhere off the coast of Africa"".They have just come back from a mission and must turn around,within about three hours,and mount a rescue operation to a French mission to retrieve the missionary,his wife,an assistant and a doctor working there. They arrive at their destination in Nigeria,and the area is full of refugees;some who can walk and others who can't. The missionary,his wife and assistant won't leave. The only one Waters can talk into leaving is the doctor,who in turn,will not go if her patients cannot do so. The refugees are NOT part of Waters assignment but he relents and anyone that is mobile is allowed to accompany the Seals to the evac zone.
They arrive and the choppers are on the ground awaiting their cargo. Waters then reveals he lied to get the good doctor to the zone and says he must leave the rest behind. They lift off but as they pass over the mission all aboard become witness to the full scale atrocities committed there. Waters orders the choppers turned around and they return to the evac zone. They get as many aboard the chopper as they can and Waters decides to escort the remainder across the boarder to Cameroon. Waters is definitely conflicted as he says this is the first time he has ever done the ""right thing"";at least he hopes it is. His commanding officer aboard the carrier orders him to stop what he is doing but Waters in all conscience can't. And as events unfold it becomes clear his decision definitely was the right thing to do.
Behind the party and dogging them all the way are Nigerian rebel forces. As they are within about 30 Klicks of the Cameroon border they come upon an ethnic cleansing in a remote village in progress. Waters orders were not to engage the enemy unless forced to but again Waters cannot stand by and watch this unfold. His team enters the village and takes out the rebels there. This side operation has taken precious time away from their schedule and it soon seems that the rebels that follow the party have some inside help in tracking them as they get within about an hour of them. It turns out one of them had a tracking device on them. It also turns out the rebels have another reason to dog the party. The reigning leader of the country,now killed,sent his only son(and now tribal king)to the missionary and he is also among those fleeing. It now gives Waters and his squad that much more impetus to reach safety.
The soldiers have a running/retreating battle with the rebels and as they are within a stones throw of the border the rebels give their final push to destroy the Navy team and their charges. In the end the squad is reduced to half its strength with many of the refugees dead. However the doctor and the future king do make it to the border as the Navy sends in a pair of birds to take out the attacking rebels with some napalm rockets. The film ends as the future king is surrounded by his future subjects promising freedom to his people.
Tautly directed and edited,with high score all around in the acting department,this film has rarely if any a dull moment as the characters flee for their lives. The horrors of African warfare,or just senseless warfare anywhere,is amply illustrated throughout. Touches like one soldier finding out a rebel dying in his arms is just a kid,or a woman who died after being brutally raped and had her breasts cut off,are poignant touches indeed and drive the movies on going theme home in spades. It certainly raises this film above its basic premise of being a military rescue op.
Technically speaking the film has been transferred into its`widescreen a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include deleted scenes,commentary,a making of featurette,an interactive map of Nigeria and more.

1880501,1,B000096IBT,"Bruce Willis is my favorite actor, hands down. All of his films are good, which is why I bought this one.

Within 5 minutes you know he's a way too high caliber actor for this movie. You can tell that everyone else is just going through the paces, as in, they can't act. Bruce apparantly realizes this too, so once he gets involved (on the way to the battlefield) he gives an emotional, powerful speech about the poverty and genocide in the area the film's set in; which will hopefully compel the other actors involved to at least put forward an effort.

No. They give their plot devices away instead. ""I'm in it purely to save lives,"" one says. ""[Screw] them, I just need money,"" says another. ""I hear the natives give great [love]. I'm purely here for the [love],"" says the typecast African-American, with no qualms for his role. (Ten points if you can guess the first killed.)

Bruce tries to save the movie one last time about 40min. in with an anecdote. ""Maybe now you understand the full consequence of war!""

""I hope I get to save somebody,"" says one. ""I'm not leaving until I have enough for that Benz,"" says the other.

Thankfully Bruce then cancells on this movie (he's in half of a scene then magically gone a second later, with the general idea proposed later that he stepped on a mine). He wisely signs on for DIE HARD: WITH A VENGENCE instead. Appreciated greatly.",1297209600,,1378,4.518072289156627

1880523,3,B000096IBT,"Tears of the Sun is a 2003 American war film, depicting a United States Navy SEAL team rescue mission amidst a civil war in the West African country of Nigeria. Lt. A.K. Waters (Bruce Willis) commands the team sent to rescue U.S. citizen Dr. Lena Fiore Kendricks (Monica Bellucci) from the civil war en route to her jungle hospital. The film was directed by Antoine Fuqua.

lets start on the pros. Bruce willis and the cast did a solid job portraying their characters. You have a nice big action scene at the end and a few good battles spread through the film. The scenes showing the brutality of the violent ethnic cleansing, against the Christian (mainly Catholic) Igbo tribes in the southern region are were this movie shines in my opinion. The cast of Tears of the Sun features refugees portrayed by true African refugees living in the U.S. I actually enjoyed the directors commentary and the dvd has some pretty solid extra content.

Now the cons. It's never really explained why the doctor is so important in the film. American citizens have been in the middle of war zones before or even been jailed and the government didn't send navy seals to save them. I could have bought it if this chick was the relative of some one powerful of even a American diplomat or something. Also Willis character completely disobeys the orders of his commanding officer in the films which is were this film jumps the shark in my opinion. some reviewers say you can easily ignore this,but not me. See I like a film's story to make a bit of sense. Why bother making a some what realistic war movie to have a character do something that's unrealistic. It's kind of funny to me how all his soldiers know that he's disobeying orders and continue to follow him putting their lives even more at risk for some doctor and a few poor villagers they don't even know. It would have bee a little bit more realistic if at least one soldier had objected or cut out on him at least. Also I don't get why they based the film on a made of conflict when you have so many real ones they could have based it on. It also suffers from your standard action film problems were of course the bad guys can't shoot and the good guys can't miss. It can be violent at times and some parents may not want younger viewers to see some scenes later on in the film. All the actors did a solid job,but no one really stood out to me. I really didn't connect with any of the characters to be honest.

All in all a solid war film that's worth watching. Don't get me wrong I actually enjoyed the film,but I like plots that make sense so this is just decent for me. Lots of action with a sensible script is what I'm asking for. I don't get the people who say it's horrible,but it doesn't deserve the high ratings either.",1295654400,,2768,4.40234375

'Tears of the Sun' has only just been released as a Director's Cut on SD DVD & whatever your opinion of the film you have to question why, why, why is the Blu-Ray release still only the original studio cut and minus the extra 11minutes?

Ho hum.....ok rant over:

'Tears' is an OK actioner.  Willis, leading a decent cast, turns in an oddly effective dead pan performance. I was impressed by his war weary 'Lt' characterization. Of the better aspects of the movie, along with great cinematography by Mauro Fiore and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, was the solid performances with actors like; Monica Bellucci, Nick Chinlund, Sammi Rotibi et als all delivering much more subtle, rounded characters than you might expect from a film in this genre.

One of the main criticisms leveled by reviewers here is that Navy SEAL Willis, unbelievably and counter to his orders, turns back the helo to rescue all the refugees. The counter argument to support Willis's character not to, on this day, dumbly go along ticking State Dept's boxes as he has done throughout his career is touched on later in the film. After the ad hoc 'are you guys with me?' discussion Willis holds by the river prior to the denouement, Eamonn Walker's character 'Zee' envinces emotionally, ""...for all the years we were told to stand down & stand by ... you're doin' the right thing"". It's not Shakespeare but that's good enough for me.

Other gripes about the realism of weapons use and tactics I am unqualified to comment on - Rogue Spear on Veteran Difficulty is the full extent of my Black Ops experience :] - but to be fair I felt there was enough detail in there to forgive a scene of firing from the hip nonsense or that Fisher Price super GPS tracking laptop - after all it's an action film not a Weapons Manual.

In the end your left with an attempt at a half decent moral message and a good atmospheric soundtrack. It's good rainy sunday afternoon fare.",1274832000,2,2065,4.613079019073569

Waters and his elite squadron of tactical specialists are forced to choose between their duty and their humanity, between following orders by ignoring the conflict that surrounds them, or finding the courage to follow their conscience and protect a group of innocent refugees. When the democratic government of Nigeria collapses and the country is taken over by a ruthless military dictator, Waters, a fiercely loyal and hardened veteran is dispatched on a routine mission to retrieve a Doctors Without Borders physician, Dr. Lena Kendricks. Dr. Kendricks, an American citizen by marriage, is tending to the victims of the ongoing civil war at a Catholic mission in a remote village. When Waters arrives, however, Dr. Kendricks refuses to leave unless he promises to help deliver the villagers to political asylum at the nearby border. If they are left behind, they will be at the mercy of the enormous rebel army. Waters is under strict orders from his commanding officer Captain Bill Rhodes to remain disengaged from the conflict. But as he and his men witness the brutality of the rebels first-hand, they are won over to Dr. Kendricks' cause and place their lives at risk by agreeing to escort the villagers on a perilous trek through the dense jungle. As they move through the countryside on foot, Waters' team, experts at evasion and concealment, are inexplicably and ferociously pursued by an army of rebels. They are confounded until they discover that, among the refugees, is the sole survivor of the country's previous ruling family, whom the rebels have been ordered to eliminate at all costs. Waters and his small band of soldiers must weigh the life of one man against their own and the refugees they feel obliged to protect.

1880532,4,B000096IBT,"I saw this movie on T.V. two nights ago. (We don't get to movies in theatres, my husband has hearing aids and can't handle the noise!) I'd wanted to see it for some time, because the simple blurb in the T.V. magazine preview indicated something special. It's unfortunate most people will simply think it's just another Bruce Willis 'actioner'. I haven't read all the reviews but I may be one of the few women to write one. I won't repeat the details of the script, simply list my own observations.

Story: all important, in both books and movies. This story was played out with clarity and compassion. Certainly it became a little gung-ho at the end, but one could become deeply involved in the action scenes, the portrayals of the members of a small, highly trained military unit, and the simply accepted fact, once unknown in the movie world, of Africans as human beings.

Acting: Bruce Willis has matured well. He played his role perfectly and believably, conveyed all the feelings of a man and a soldier in terrible circumstances with admirable economy. Seldom has a wooden expression served its owner so well! The men under his command were equally believable in their roles. Monica Bellucci as the doctor I could not quite warm to. She did all that was required of her, yet I couldn't quite believe in her character as I did the men's. After the movie finished I wondered what an actress of the calibre of Meg Ryan or Susan Sarandon would have made of the role. And Tom Skerrit didn't quite click as the senior officer.

Blood and Violence: I don't handle these well. I've refused to see the Mel Gibson produced movies for that reason. But, as in 'Gladiator', the brutality and cruelty of human beings to one another, as depicted, was acceptable because it was part of the storyline. It was neither explicit nor graphic; it wasn't thrown in for the sake of sensationalism.

Why gut-and-heart wrenching? In a phrase, I cared for the people and what happened to them. In a word, realistic. Why deeply moving? Because after the end of the story I realised how fortunate we in the western civilisations are, to live in even comparative safety.

P.S. And its title is similar to that of my favourite science-fiction story, The Sun's Tears by Brian M. Stableford, published in 1974!",1261440000,2,2282,4.709273182957394

Although I doubt that, had Kev lived, he would've gotten THAT much credit from Mr. 5'7"" New Jersey Boy.

1880534,3,B000096IBT,"Set in Nigeria, Tears of the Sun (2003) is a typical jungle rescue, combat epic, with plenty of explosions, and thousands of rounds expended.  Director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, The Replacement Killers) also wanted to shine a light on the very dark side of humanity, taking a look at the brutality of ethnic cleansing (genocide).

Bruce Willis (Die Hard) is Lieutenant A. K. Waters, the leader of a group of Navy SEALs sent into the jungle to extract Lena Fiore Kendricks (Monica Bellucci) a doctor practicing in a clinic there.  Dr. Kendricks insists that her friends also be taken to safety.  A large group head for the rendezvous point, where Kendricks is dragged aboard a helicopter, and forced to abandon her friends.  Flying out, the mission is all but done, when Waters unexpectedly turns the chopper back.  The chopper transports just a few of the refuges to safety, leaving the SEAL team, Kendricks, and the remaining refuges, to try and find a way out on foot.  During their journey, they encounter the horrors of ethnic cleansing, as rebel forces systematically exterminate anyone the encounter.

As an African-American concerned about the future of Africa, revealing the horrors of ethnic cleansing, was Fuqua's goal.  He presents the terror of murder, rape, and torture, where men are burned alive, and women have their breasts cut off.  This part of the film is truly shocking, providing a glimpse into the kind of atrocities reported to have taken place in Nigeria.

While the massacres make a strong impression, the overall story has many elements that are not very credible.  While having Doctor Kendricks along adds to the 'drama', clearly the logical thing to do was to have included her in the group sent to safety on the helicopter.  Securing her life was the goal of the mission, and Waters fails big time when given the chance.  Other plot elements involving secret intrigue among the refugees, and the wishy washy attitude of Navy command, add drama, but strain the limits of believability.

Up until the final battle, the action sequences are well done and mostly realistic.  Fuqua had effectively shown the genocide, and the plight of the victims.  Unfortunately, much of the credibility built up to this point, is blown away in the film's finale, that is pure Hollywood.  Way over the top, and too talky.  The fighter planes coming to the rescue, take forever to arrive.  And the melodramatic finish, is terribly clichd.

Antoine Fuqua covers many subjects in his fiery commentary track.  The film was shot in Hawaii, because after 9/11, there was reluctance to film outside of the country.  Fortunately the terrain, weather, and plant life there, was very similar to the area of Nigeria featured in the film.

This is beautifully-filmed, artistic in spots and I'm curious what the Blu-Ray version looks like.  The sound is excellent, too.

National critics didn't like this movie. I suspect one big reason is that they are used to seeing films in which Christians are shown as sympathetic victims of persecution.

Willis is perfect for this role as the strong, stone-faced leader. Monica Bellucci could have been a little more likable as the doctor. The story gets a little too melodramatic at the end, but it's tolerable.

This is not a family film by any means, because of the violence, perhaps 20 f-words and a dozen abuses of the Lord's name in vain. Still, an interesting movie with a different slant, and at least has a noble message.",1241395200,2,972,4.761904761904762

An elite unit of U.S. NAVY SEALs is ordered into Nigeria to escort an American doctor and three Europeans (a Catholic priest and two nuns) to safety, following a coup staged by the northern Muslim Fulani tribe against the southern Christian Ibo tribe for control of the oil-rich nation. During the mission the unit's commander witnesses the atrocities committed by rebel fighters, disobeys orders, and engages the perpetrators. As a result, he decides to take up the task of escorting a group of refugees across the border into neighboring Cameroon. Things will be further complicated when hundreds of Muslim fighters giving chase seem particularly interested in one of the refugees...
Bruce Willis (in a familiar role) and the rest of the cast carry out their performances well (though nothing extraordinary), however, Monica Bellucci's character as well as her acting were surprisingly not that great or convincing (she was rather annoying for a change). The likelihood that a crack team would jeopardize its mission and risk embarrassing the U.S. on humanitarian grounds is highly unlikely. Moreover, logic dictates that the SEALs will be court-marshalled and imprisoned for their actions, none of which is shown in the movie.

On the other hand is the drama of the faintly addressed but seething issues of human rights, multilateralism, and the limits of military power.  Tears doesn't deal with these complexities with the finiteness of a film like Platoon, nor does it possess the visual beauty of a film like The Thin Red Line.  To its credit, there are fine performances by Monica Bellucci and others, and the film avoids the condescending and even racist view of Africans in Black Hawk Down.  But most significantly, and not to give anything away, viewers should look for a single scene that is as brutal, vengeful, compassionate, and poignant as any in the finer combat films.  Perhaps Tears doesn't quite reach the nobility its script aspires to, but this successfully done, difficult, and powerful scene is redemptive of the effort and leaves the viewer with an image--and something to thing about--he'll recall long after seeing the film.",1221091200,4,1164,4.943589743589744
1880565,3,B000096IBT,"""Tears of the Sun"" (2003) tells the story of a squadron of Navy Seals led by Bruce Willis who are on mission in Nigeria to remove a beautiful American doctor (Monica Belucci) from a Christian village before evil Islamic militants move in and annihilate 'em all. Belucci insists that ""her people"" go with them. Willis initially refuses but later has a change of heart. Since there are too many to remove via helicoptor they have no choice but to lead 'em out on foot to the Cameroon border. Will they make it out alive?

I remember seeing a scene or two while channel surfing a few years ago and it perked my interest. What I saw had an ultra-serious vibe and seemed to have depth as well. It looked like my cup of tea because I'm a huge fan of the original ""Apocalypse Now."" The icing on the cake is the presence of Monica Belucci, who's definitely one of the most beautiful women to ever grace God's Earth. Seriously, her face is incredible!

Well, I've seen it twice now and, despite all the positive items it has going, I can't help but find it kinda disappointing. I've already listed the positives so allow me to cite what doesn't work:

After seeing the film twice now I only remember two characters -- Willis and Belucci. Every other character is totally forgettable. This isn't the case at all with, say, ""Apocalypse Now"" wherein the viewer knew and remembered every single member of Capt. Willard's team after seeing the film once, not to mention the major peripheral characters. Another good example would be ""Last Of The Mohicans"" (1992), which has a similar theme (i.e. good people being chased through the forest by evil villains).

The mistake of ""Tears of the Sun"" is that it jumps right into the thick of the jungle story without allowing the viewer to get to know anyone. As already noted, the theme is heavy and the vibe is fittingly serious, including the score, but because we aren't emotionally tied to the characters the picture comes across too heavy-handed and melodramtic.

I should also add that the 2-hour film is fairly slow moving and that the big-action sequence doesn't take place until the finale. The problem with this ""exciting"" climax is that the viewer, once again, doesn't care what happens at this point because we don't really know the characters and therefore have little emotional attachment. I just got done watching the ending and I was quite bored -- lazily strumming my acoustic guitar, looking around the room, etc.

Although the story takes place in Nigeria the picture was obviously shot in Hawaii. The difference in geography is enough that the film loses points for realism, but who can deny the beauty of Hawaii? So maybe it gains the points back.

The Director's Cut merely adds the deleted scenes from the Special Edition dvd to the film. In other words, unless you absolutely love the film it's not necessary to buy the Director's Cut; just watch the deleted scenes. Speaking of the deleted scenes, there's one quietly potent scene where a black American talks with a black Nigerian. It has great dialogue and should have never been cut.

BOTTOM LINE: ""Tears of the Sun"" has some attributes, including the ultra-serious vibe, cinematography, score and Monica Belucci. But this is far from a good film. At the same time, it's not bad. It's just okay. Check out ""Rambo"" (2008) if you want to see the same theme done in an effective manner.

1880571,4,B000096IBT,"This is a down-to-earth, brutal portrayal of the nature of Africa's troubled past, present, and future.  True, Bruce Willis' portrayal may initially seem overly dramatic, and that is the nature of films.  However, and despite the fact that I am not a Willis fan, the portrayal is on the mark for this type of film, and certainly that particular role.
The movie is reminiscent of Richard Burton's ""The Wild Geese,"" but is much more graphically violent and reflective of the true nature of the African socio-political dilemma.

But what made the film personally meaningful was the graphic realism of what occured in the story, and I emphasize the term ""real.""  There will be viewers who will insist that the violence is over-stated, but even the opposite is true.

I was in the Congo in November 1964, specifically at Kisangani, and was a member of one of the military units that attempted to extricate and save the lives of the missionaries, nuns, and priests there.  Having failed to do so was one of the most wrenching experiences of our collective lives.  That experience did expose all of us to the most graphic examples of ""man's inhumanity to man,"" and believe me, the film should provide a realistic view of the unfortunate, convoluted nature of a large part of Africa to this day.

Yes, I highly recommend the film, though I am certain that it will be very, very quiet around the TV set while you are watching a tale that will definitely fire some emotions.",1212796800,3,1464,4.7362204724409445
1880572,5,B000096IBT,"In this steeply underrated movie, stereotyping, along with strongly evoked political opinions, have clearly denigrated and mis-maligned the exemplary movie, ""Tears of the Sun,"" into a mediocre movie that ""offers nothing new to the military action genre....""  That viewers even perceive of this magnificent film as a military action genre movie, is nothing short of inexcusable--""Tears of the Sun"" is drama at it's best.  Moreover, the unfortunate type-casting of Bruce Willis as merely an action genre actor  apparently blurs the perception of both fans and critics alike.  Indeed, such misconceptions of Bruce Willis are long standing, in spite of his resume in similar films (e.g., ""In Country""--see my review of this film under this title) and comedy (e.g., ""Moonlighting;"" ""Sunset Boulevard"").  Yes, the movie includes military (Navy SEALS) characters and depicts military special operations and guerrilla/rebel/(terrorist) actions, BUT that is NOT what the movie is about!

This is a character driven drama film, with superlative acting on the part of Bruce Willis, Monica Bellucci, and the rest of the cast--which includes actual Nigerian refugees playing the Nigerians.  This is a movie about individuals, their personal characteristics, extenuating hardships and events, organizational (military and otherwise) codes of conduct, and the decisions made as a result of their interactions.  AND it is a movie about politics, political agendas, and how they translate into reality for individuals--and their doing the right thing.

For Lt. Waters (Bruce Willis) the ""reality"" is his assigned rules of engagement (engage only if fired on) and his assigned mission--securing Dr. Lena Kendricks (Monica Bellucci).  However, in forcing Dr. Kendricks to leave (in violation of her constitutional rights) and get onto the helicopter, in leaving refugees behind (that he'd told he was evacuating), and in seeing (yet again) what the ""rebels"" have done to the Mission (where Dr. Kendricks was working), a ""transformation"" that even Lt. Waters does not understand is invoked--although the viewer may see him humanizing the events he finds himself in.  Moreover, while moving to the evacuation site, Lt. Waters finds himself in a situation of having to ""fluidly assess"" his rules of engagement: he kills a straggling ""rebel"" soldier to prevent his men (along with the doctor and the refugees) from being fired upon.  Thus, while his mission is to secure the ""package"" (Dr. Kendricks) and the rules of engagement are to engage only if fired on, events force Lt. Waters to subjectively (in military jargon, ""fluidly assess"" the situation), rather than objectively, interpret the intent of his mission and his ordered rules of engagement.  And so, as they evacuate, Lt. Waters makes another decision--based on the interaction of the reality at hand and his apparently ""newly found conscience""--to turn the helicopter around.  In doing so, Lt Waters is ""fluidly assessing"" his mission and rules of engagement: the mission now is Dr. Kendricks and her ""luggage""--the refugees; his rules of engagement become whatever is needed to protect the mission.  This decision then further interacts with future factors, pushing Lt. Waters to make more and more subjective decisions, each of which seriously challenges his (and others) interpretation of his mission, and his interpretation of his rules for engagement.

As the lines of interpretation blur for Lt. Waters, the interactions of his self, his mission, and his decision increasingly personalize events as they unfold.  In turn, each decision he makes, along with his increased personalization, effects the men of his command, and they too begin to personalize the ""mission"" and their understanding of what needs to be done (and, ultimately, sacrificed) as events occur.  The personalization process recedes eventually into individual politics, as portrayed when Lt. Waters calls his men together, briefs them, and tells them to speak their minds.  In Lt. Waters' fashion, he is seeking to establish a common political agenda with that of the ""mission"" (Dr. Kendricks and ""her"" people) and the rapidly fluidly changing rules of engagement.

For Dr. Lena Kendricks (Monica Bellucci) the ""reality"" is her oath as a doctor/humanitarian and her mission to protect ""her people,"" the refugees--and in particular the last surviving hereditary leader of the previous ruling ethnic group.  In being forced to leave the Mission, she challenges Lt. Waters', and his men's, objectivity and sense of ""reality"", by flaunting and demanding acknowledgment of the Nigerians' ""reality"" and the politics of Nigeria--including the agenda of genocide.  Her refusal to leave the ""able"" refugees behind at the Mission and her outrage in learning that Lt. Waters lied to her, along with her inability to make her own choices, leaves her vulnerable, helpless and mistrusting.  But, Lt. Waters' killing of the ""rebel"" soldier, which both horrifies and angers her (because he didn't kill them all), forces Dr. Kendricks to recognize the severity of the situation.  So, when Lt. Waters does return, she subjectively assess the situation, and makes the decision to withhold information and constantly argue with the soldiers, hoping to bring sanity where there is none.  As events unfold, Dr. Kendricks comes to personalize Lt. Waters and his men, subjectively softening her angst, but not her mistrust, of the soldiers and their potential sacrifices.  When a ""mole"" is discovered and shot fleeing, she is once again faced with a decision: to tell or not to tell Lt. Waters about the ""special"" refugee.  Her failure to tell brings her fidelity into question, both for herself and for Lt. Waters and his men.  A fierce ambush that inflicts casualties to both soldiers and refugees results in Dr. Hendricks' decision to alter her subjective perspective of the situation, becoming more vocal in pushing the refugees forward and doing whatever she can to protect everyone.  When soldiers are hit or do extraordinary tasks, she personalizes them as if they were ""her"" people.  In doing so, so do the Nigerians personalize their perspective of the soldiers and their ""reality,"" picking up weapons to help defend themselves and others.  In Dr. Hendricks' fashion, she is also seeking to establish a common political agenda with her humanitarianism and more encompassing mission to protect everyone, and Lt. Waters' political agenda.

As for complaints I have seen in other reviews, I have a few rebuttals.  First, while I have seen many of Bruce Willis' and Antoine Fuqua's movies, I do not understand the complaint that there is an ""all too familiar cast, (right down to Tom Skerritt as the ""Captain"")....""  Even if some of the cast have been in other movies together, how does that detract from their performances in ""Tears of the Sun?""  They are all solid in my opinion.  Second, as for make-up appearing to be ""halloween funny,"" I can honestly say that I only notice make-up when it interferes with the actors performance, which was not the case in this movie.  Conversely, I did feel that the face camo at the beginning was far better than most movies, and seemed to ""wear"" off as it normally would (based on my personal military experiences).  Third, with regards to the combat scenes, I can honestly say that this is the first movie I can recall, where the ambushed soldiers did exactly what they would do in combat.  Granted, for filming purposes they walked rather than ran (which would have made the scene last seconds not minutes) and the soldiers were bunched up too tight so they would all fit in the lens.  But, otherwise I felt this was very well done; as were most of the other ""battle"" scenes.  Fourth, with regards to the comment that the movie is ""Apalling [sic] racist claptrap,"" which in ""[h]aving chosen to set it in a real country, Nigeria, the movie then proceeds to play Nigerians as 'bad, evil' people who will commit atrocities because they can;....""  As a person who abhors discrimination and stereotyping of any individual or group, I saw nothing that was ""appalling,"" ""racist,"" or performances that simply portrayed Nigerians as ""'bad, evil 'people.""  I did see Nigerians acting like Nigerian refugees, some of which were excellent performances.  Yes, the so called ""rebel"" soldiers were shown as being one-dimensional and performing ""outrageous"" acts of terrorism, crime, and genocide.  But the reality is unfortunately simple: mutilation, rape, dismemberment, torture, murder and other unthinkable acts are committed in ""war,"" as well as other times; and often by all sides involved.  And they have happened in Nigeria, just as they have occurred in the US (e.g., see my review of ""Soldier Blue"") and all other countries.  That said, it is unfortunate that there was not enough time allowed to enhance the one-dimensional portrayals of the ""rebels.""  For example, many of the so called ""rebels"" were probably also victims of violence and forced into the military, and as such were acting in the only way they knew how.  For a better understanding of this process, I strongly recommend ""Pedagogy of the Oppressed,"" by Paulo Freire and Myra Bergman Ramos.  Lastly, with regards to any criticism that the film is ""jingoism"" (advocacy of warlike foreign policy), ""sword rattling,"" ""militaristic,"" or some other form of propaganda, I can only ask ""what hole are you hiding in?""  Please try to remember that ""Tears of the Sun"" is a character driven FICTIONAL drama that is about politics, political agendas, and how they translate into reality for individuals--and the decisions they make in the moment.

1880575,5,B000096IBT,"Last week, including the weekend, I watched three great war action movies on television, namely:

1) 'Black Hawk Down', starring Josh Hartnett, Tom Sizemore, Eric Bana;

2) 'Behind Enemy Lines', starring Owen Wilson, Gene Hackman;

3) 'Tears of the Sun', starring Bruce Willis, Monica Bellucci, Tom Skerritt;

The first movie was based on an actual event that took place in Mogadishu, Somalia on the African continent in October 1993 during the Clinton presidency.

The second movie was apparently a fictional adaptation of an actual event that supposedly took place during the Bosnia-Serbia conflict.

The third movie was more of a fictional account that had the starvation-ravaged Nigeria caught in an ethnic civil war as a background setting.

In the war action movie, 'Tears of the Sun', directed by Antoine Fuqua (behind 'The Replacement Killers', 'The Shooter', 'King Arthur'), Lt. A K Waters (Bruce Willis) led an elite team of Navy SEALs into Nigerian territory to retrieve an American 'Doctors Without Borders' physician, Dr. Lena Kendricks (Monica Bellucci), who was tending victims of the ongoing ethnic civil war at a Catholic mission in a remote village.

It was meant to be a simple, straight-forward extraction.

They were under strict orders from their commanding officer, Capt. Bill Rhodes (Tom Skerritt) to remain disengaged from the conflict on the ground.

[The democratically elected Nigerian government of Samuel Akuza was overthrown by a ruthless military dictator, who was determined to wipe out the entire ruling family.]

Unfortunately, Lt. Waters did not realised that he had to deal with a tough cookie like Dr Kendricks, who demanded that the team also rescued some seventy refugees at the mission.

Lt. Waters & his team witnessed the extreme brutality of the rebels under the military dictator, & was immediately won over to Dr Kendrick's cause, & placed their own lives at risk by agreeing to escort the refugees on a perilous trek through dense jungle to reach the border with Cameroon.

They were pursued relentlessly by the rebels, under the command of a sadistic Col. Sadick, & were confounded until they discovered that, among the refugees, was the sole survivor of the country's previous ruling family, whom the rebels had been ordered to eliminate at all costs.

Lt. Waters had to weigh the life of one seemingly important man against their own & the refugees they were obliged to protect.

The rest of the movie traced their daring exploits through the dense jungle & open fields to reach the border, with the ruthless rebels on hot pursuit.

Frankly speaking, for me, this was one thought-provoking movie that truly portrayed what ethnic cleansing as well as wartime atrocities might really be like.

What I like about the story was that, Lt. Waters, a hardened military veteran, defied orders from his superiors. He did what he thought was the right thing to do. It was a judgement call he could not refused at all.

Contrary to military protocol, he also gave his men a chance to have a say.

I particularly like what one of the team members, James Atkins (Cole Hauser) said in response: ""I can't look at them (the refugees) like package anymore. I'm gonna get them out or I'm gonna die trying.""

Also, the Navy SEAL team members did not always agree with Lt Waters, & yet they remained loyal to him anyway.

The last segment of the movie was gritty & poignant.

Lt. Waters, with three Navy SEAL team members, all badly wounded, & Dr Kendricks, plus a small number of refugees, including the important Azuka heir, eventually survived the ordeal, as they finally crossed the border with Cameroon.

I was really touched when one of the refugees, with tears in her eyes, said to Lt. Waters: ""I will never forget you...God will never forget you.""

I reckon the ending quotation at the epilogue of the movie truly sums up my emotional sentiments about this movie: ""The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing,"" attributed to Edmund Burke.

Again, I must say, despite minor technical flaws in the story, this is one hell of a good war action movie to watch.

It was a sobering thought to watch Bruce Willis in one of his toughest & sombre roles. In his other movies, e.g. the 'Moonlighting' television series as well as the 'Die Hard' movie quartet, he was always the wise cracker. In this movie, he was a very fine actor. Just look at his expressive eyes.

As for Monica Bellucci, she was a totally different person, unlike her sexy vivacious persona in her other movies, e.g. the two Matrix sequels.

To sum up all the three war action movies in the foregoing posts, I want to take this opportunity to share with readers a dedication statement I had learned - & remembered - since my secondary school days. It came from Sir Winston Churchill, the wartime British Prime Minister:

""Never in the field of human conflict, have so many owed so much to so few.""

So, dear readers, please go & watch the three foregoing war action movies. You will be delighted.",1196121600,4,5029,4.847953216374269
1880576,4,B000096IBT,"2003's ""Tears of the Sun"" was released just prior to the start of the current war in Iraq; the timing and its setting in a civil war-torn Nigeria probably denied it the attention this well-crafted and tough-minded movie deserved.

Directed by Antoine Fuqua, ""Tears of the Sun"" features Bruce Willis as a Navy SEAL team Lieutenant and Monica Belluci as the American missionary doctor his team is sent to rescue.  The setting is yet another non-combatant evacuation of American citizens from a troubled African country.  As with any military mission, there are rules of engagement.  Willis's boss, a crusty Navy Admiral nicely played by Tom Skerrit, tells the SEALs to get in, rescue the American, and get out without becoming involved in the local conflict.

Willis's team saddles up, enters the jungle by helicopter, locates the mission and the American doctor, and encounters their first complication. The doctor refuses to leave without the Nigerian refugees in her care, who will be slaughtered by rebel militia if left behind.  The war-weary but compassionate SEAL leader elects to defy his orders and try to escort the refugees to safety at the nearest land border.

Thus begins a grim journey, as the SEALs shepard the refugees through a gauntlet of jungle infested by murderous rebel militia, repeatedly betrayed by a traitor among the refugees.  The SEALs will demonstrate their combat skills in a series of battles with the militia, motivated by their growing empathy for the refugees.

Fuqua's direction is fast-paced; the action sequences are often brutal but adroitly staged.  Willis is stoic and entirely believable as the SEAL team leader; the sarcasm of ""Die Hard's"" John McClane would have been inappropriate here.  The conflict between Willis and his boss over the rules of engagement looks contrived in the face of the admiral's repeated efforts to help the SEAL team, but the real message may have been intended for those political leaders who averted their eyes from  bloodbaths like Rhwanda in an earlier time.

This movie is well-recommended as an above-average action thriller with emotional content.",1188000000,4,2123,5.154518950437318

But I didn't give it a 5-star rating becuase I wanted to see more of the Bad guys. They looked mean and colorful, but they were never delved into. I like books and movies where the bad guy's characters are covered, making them more interesting.

 I heard that early blu-ray releases titles wasn't that amazing til new titles came out in between Christmas 2006 and February 2007 so, well i just had to take a look at this movie because I seen it once on tv but i am happy that this movie is in perfect condition with picture and sound quality from blu-ray... I believe it is not the blu-ray, it just what kind of tv and what kind of blu-ray player you are using.

The only way to have all the excitement that you will need ""digital equipment""

 1. You need an HDTV that contains 720p or 1080p.. I don't trust 1080i. Make sure your HDTV has an intergraded or HD turner built-in.. if it dont.. get an set up box.  Make sure your HDTV have an HDMI or Component connection.. I recommend HDMI which is far the best possible picture and sound quality.

2. Late blu-ray players released are far the best as Sony or Panasonic BD players.  I have an Playstation 3 which it plays blu-ray the best.

3. This is option but to me is an requirement if you want surround sound theater like.. Make sure you get any receiver with 600 watts or over with Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1 built-in.  Dolby Digtial EX and DTS-ES 6.1 are my favorites and superior. Some blu-ray disc contains DTS-HD or Dolby TrueHD.  DTS-HD does work on my DTS-ES receiver, so i guess it don't matter as long you have DTS and Dolby 5.1 or 6.1 even 7.1, and up.(it is up to you)

Conclusion:
 It is time to start using Digital instead of Analog.. Blu-ray  Company is doing great with their business.  Tears of the Sun is very great movie.. keep you focusing and thinking.  Sometime you might feel like you in the movie cause of lot of dramatization emtional feelings. It looks better than I first saw it on TV but this is blu-ray taking over and makes it looks new again.  Great sound, Great picture, Great movie, Great Actors, and Great Score to make 5 stars!!!",1171670400,,2000,4.333333333333333
1880590,3,B000096IBT,"The film show upheaval in Nigeria after a military coup. Ethnic cleansing erupts, politics by tribal warfare. Foreign nationals are evacuated. This is caused by the fight over the oil wealth of Nigeria. A small military group is sent in to extract American civilians. They parachute in, locate the physician, the priest, and the nuns. But some refuse to leave, the religious are devoted to their mission. The SEALs leave with the doctor and those who can walk out before the rebels arrive. But the many slow them down. They hide when rebel forces pass near them. The helicopter arrives to carry them away to safety. As they pass the mission they see the bodies and the burning buildings. The Lieutenant orders a change in plans, they return to extract a dozen civilians, and lead the rest to Cameroun. The rebel troops figure out what happened, and pursue the fugitives. Why are these few civilians followed?

The Lt. decides to become engaged in the strife when a village lies in their path to safety. The film shows the use of silencers on pistols and rifles to eliminate the obstructions. Some of the villagers are saved from the atrocities. The survivors gather the boots and arms from the fallen troops. Then they discover a traitor in their midst. One of the refugees is the son of the murdered President, the King of the Ibo tribe. He is the target of the rebel troops! (Like Henry VII's purge of the Plantagenet dynasty.) The Lt. is advised to dump the refugees and escape with his men. But he talks to his men, and they stay the course. They come up with a plan to lose their pursuers. But they are found by the rebel troops and attacked. They defend themselves against the attackers. Will they be overwhelmed? But a higher authority has ordered in fighters from the aircraft carrier, and they arrive in time. Napalm is dropped on the rebel troops to halt their attack.

I found it really funny, that none of the Nigerian soldiers could shoot straight. Its ironic that all the people trying to do something good for the Africans were either Americans or Europeans, considering the fact that much of Africa's problems today could be attributed to European Colonization, or how everyone turned a blind-eye to what happened in Rwanda.

1880596,3,B000096IBT,"TEARS OF THE SUN is one of those movies where you have to kind of wonder why it was made in the first place.  It concerns a small group of elite American soldiers sent into a civil-war torn African nation to extract an American doctor, a priest and two nuns and get them to safety.  When the doctor only agrees to go if all her patients who can walk are also allowed to leave, the American's face some difficult and dangerous choices as they trek across country to safety while pursued by bloodthirsty killers, in the form of rebels.

Here's my problem:

1) If the movie is to be a commentary of the horrific conditions in many African locations (Rwanda, Darfur, etc.)...it provides FAR too little context to truly stir our interest and compassion.  There are a couple of disturbing scenes of the ""slaughter of innocents,"" and the best scenes in the film are in a small African village as the Americans stop the brutal slayings of all the inhabitants.  But the film has no true call to action, no indication that it is anything beyond a fiction.

2) If the movie was meant to be an entertaining action flick, with the stoic Bruce Willis at the forefront...there is too little action, and the bulk of it comes at the end and is done in a disjointed manner in which we aren't too sure what is happening.  The tone of the film is also too ""serious"" for us to just sit back and enjoy the ride.

The film wants it both ways, I think, and neither fully works.  Bruce Willis, doing his hard-eyed, bald-headed hero-of-few-words bit, is solid...but when isn't he solid.  Here's a sex symbol who has never minded letting himself look bad (16 BLOCKS), or meek (HOSTAGE in the early parts) or aging.  He's so reliable, we take him for granted.  But even in mediocre movies, his presence is always welcome...as in TEARS OF THE SUN.  Willis is backed by a mixed group of Americans...all carefully selected to present different viewpoints and personalities.  The relatively unknown actors all do just fine, but they are really ""types,"" not people.

To me, a disturbing undercurrent in the film is racism.  Director Antwone Fuqua (I'm sure I've spelled it wrong) who did TRAINING DAY, is an African-American, but he falls into the trap of making all the Africans either a) totally hapless and completely beholden to the Americans...most of whom are white, or b) complete slimebuckets of the first order. No black characters are really fleshed out.  They are extras to be shot.  In an early scene, the ""bad"" rebels burst into the monastery/hospital.  We see the brave priest (white) being bullied about, shoved and ultimately killed with a machete. Later, all the Africans are slaughtered, but we only see that from above, after the fact, from a helicopter.

Also a bit disturbing is the waste of Monica Bellucci.  Here is a serious European actress, one of the bravest in the business, trying to make an impression in Hollywood.  Her small roles in the final two MATRIX movies at least had a chance to show off her feminine side, shall we say.  But here she is simply miscast.  Despite occasional smears of dirt on her face, she looks like a European ""babe,""...shirt half unbuttoned, misty-eyed, beestung lips.  A brave American doctor helping the most helpless people on earth?  Don't buy it for a second.  She should have passed on the role.

The movie is sporadically entertaining.  It is even occasionally moving...as in the gripping scenes I mentioned above at the African village.  Those scenes raise the film from 2 stars to 3 in my book.  But I know it'll never be more than 3 stars for me, because after right at 2 hours of watching TEARS OF THE SUN, I felt I had been at it all night.  It felt too much like ""work"" to see this through to the end.

If you want to see a ""refugees being helped by Americans during an armed conflict"" movie, check out THREE KINGS.  As much as I dislike George Clooney for his silly politics...this is a film that BOTH entertains and is a call to outrage at least.

TEARS OF THE SUN, on the other hand, is no great shakes.  It is ""R"" rated, and deserves it.  Not for kids.",1152662400,4,4095,4.581843191196699
1880597,5,B000096IBT,"This is an important film. The writer's original intention was to craft a film loosley around The Sandpebbles and African Queen.

The Special Edition of this film includes writers' observations by Alex Lasker and Patrick Cirillo, and they narrate as the film proceeds. They describe the evolution and changes to the original script, subject to a studio seeking to craft a film which would create profits and be a good vehicle for Bruce Willis. But, the writers wanted to draw attention to the state of Africa, and the recurring problems resulting in horrible human rights violations. They bring awareness to genocide and civil war where the western world does not want to get involved.

Reading reviews, it's amazing what this film has meant to people. Some see it as a great but mindless action film. It's meaningful enough to bring others to tears. I recently read a review proclaiming that liberals and ""America hating"" leftists would hate the film, and that the film represents the goose-step of conservatives. This is certainly at odds with the writers' intentions. As a socially liberal and left leaning American (but fiscally conservative), this attitude left me puzzled. I've always seen conservative types as huddled around their little pile of stuff acquired through life like golems, and concerned with little else in this world. They just want to protect their little pile. A good American to them has a responsibility to care little for the rest of the world, unless we can plunder someone to fatten the coffers. Neoconservatives feel a requirement to democratize the world, as planned out in the imperialistic Project For A New Century. Conservative administrations believe that war is good for corporations and business, but place no emphasis on human rights. Create a war and watch the stock market go crazy. It doesn't matter that our children will be left to figure out the unfathomable debt. Frankly, I don't get it. ""Liberals and leftists"" believe in international responsibility, and that's what this film is about.

Bruce Willis plays a good soldier who is siezed by conscience in the film, and finds it necessary break his orders to accomplish the ""right thing"". I've read reviews condemning this action, stating that orders must never be broken, and that in real life Willis would have been rightfully destined for punishment. The military order transcends moraltiy and ethics. In the real world this fact is probably true, so perhaps the film is a bit of a fantasy.

This movie is important because it draws attention to a state of affairs in Africa from which most Americans have been insulated. Recently, The Sudanese government's systematic murder and starvation of black Sudanese has been in the news, thanks to George Clooney and others. It also draws attention toward America's view of the rest of the world.

I found this movie thought provoking as well as being an exciting adventure story. Hopefully people will see this and ask some important questions. While the great nation of America should not be the world's police force, we should be a rock solid moral example for the rest of the world. Want to talk about power? What better power than that which is born out of respect. Instead we have been on a morally questionable path, conducting an unneccesary war, spending trillions and inflicting pain and suffering. We have lost 2500 soldiers of our own, with thousands wounded and traumatized. And for what? Oil? Other countries natural resources? 9/11 hysteria? A neoconservative agenda?

Oil, natural resources and greed are one of the major contributions to events of genocide around the world. This is a sub-theme of the film, intimating that America would have no intention of involvement for humanitarian issues, but oil is another matter. It's sad but true. We have a choice in who we elect, and where they are destined to lead us. We still have elected officials who regret that the south lost the Civil War, and regret the civil rights advances since then. They would consider anyone a leftist who would champion civil rights and who would sympathize with the genocide themes in the film.

This is what the film meant to me. My ""liberals eye view"" found it deeply moving and morally uplifting. One more thing ... in Special Features is a feature called ""Voices of Africa"". Eight African actors in the film recount their personal experiences and horrors in the Sudan, Nigerian, Congo, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. Thankfully many of them found refuge, and a chance for a future by escaping to America. These moving interviews alone are reason enough to purchase the Special Edition.

When it's time, vote for an administration who will make this country proud. See this film as a reminder that we are each our brother's keeper.",1147996800,7,4770,4.983668341708543
1880598,4,B000096IBT,"In spite of critics' complaints, Tears of the Sun is a successful film on many levels. Of course the conflict details are fictional-- but the details are far from the point of the story; the filmmakers obviously wanted to rather portray the heart of similar conflicts in Africa (such as Uganda, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Sudan) that the West has largely ignored. Thus, the underlying question is: why do we turn a blind eye to such injustice? Could it be that we think Africans are worth less than those with white skin or lucrative natural resources? The filmmakers succeed in causing us to care without over-manipulation, to the point that we must agree with the SEAL who says, ""I can't see them as 'packages' any more.""

While I felt it was overly brutal for the viewer to watch so many of the SEALs die in the course of the mission (as American movie watchers, we like as many of the 'good guys' to stay alive-- we're only willing to let a couple go for the sake of realism), it drives home this truth: the lives of the refugees they were protecting were just as valuable as theirs. Even though viewers are more familiar with the American characters than the majority of the Nigerians' characters, this equality in value is sucessfully made clear. In the end, we find ourselves, along with the Lieutenant [Willis], understanding why the doctor [Belucci] was unwilling to save her own life while leaving the others to die--their lives were worth just as much as our own. The quote at the end of the film leaves us with this problem to consider as we face our real-life world, just as embroiled in violence and injustice: ""The only thing necessary for evil men to triumph is for good men to do nothing.""",1147478400,3,1701,4.6138613861386135
1880599,5,B000096IBT,"I saw this movie on TV just the other day and I was a bit sceptical as I am not really a Brue Willis fan, too gung-ho for me at times but he managed win me over with this little gem of yet another underrated film.

Willis plays the taciturn and battle worn Lt. Waters  who along with his elite team of Navy SEALS are sent to war-torn Nigeria with orders to rescue an American citizen by marriage a one Dr. Lena Kendricks (Monica Bellucci). The mission is in theory cut and dry except for a small problem Dr. Kendricks is not willing to abandon the people she has grown to love during her time caring for them.

Lt Waters forces the Doctor to leave behind her friends but when he sees from the helicopter what horrific fate awaits them he disobeys a direct order from his Commanding Officer to ignore the plight of the refugees and with his men he turns back and attempts to make it to the safety of Cameroon on foot.

To make matters worse, the little band of men and women are being pursued by ruthless guerrillas who destroy everything and everyone in their path because hiding among the fleeing refugees is the sole survivor of the country's previous ruling family, whom the rebels have been ordered to eliminate at all costs.

Willis is superb as the damaged and emotionally fragile Lt. Waters who finds to his consternation that he has acquired a conscience and that he cares about what happens to the people now in his care and come hell or high water he will save them or die trying.  There are some pretty gruelling scenes such as the murder of a young woman and her baby in a village, and the savagery of the American soldiers when pursuing a traitor in their midst is equally stomach churning but each scene plays a pivotal part in the whole of the film and you become aware that you are watching something unfolding before your eyes, a drama about human nature and its ability to both shock and praise in the same breath.

The musical score from beginning to end is amazing, haunting and unforgettable and well worth listening on its own, in fact it was so good I have now got a copy of it to listen to on my computer.

As the film headed toward its violent climax I found myself on the edge of my seat as the survivors and the now battle worn American soldiers run desperately toward the Cameroon border, knowing full well that if they don't make it they will all be slaughtered mercilessly.

Watch the last few minutes of this movie for a wonderful scene when some other refugees already in Cameroon realise that there is a survivor of the slaughtered ruling family among them, that even brought a tear to my cynical eye, especially when the wounded Lt Waters watches it unfold from the helicopter, held in the loving arms of Dr Kendricks who realises what sacrifice he has made for her and the refugees. It was all done so naturally and without guile it was if I was there witnessing it myself.

A fantastic film that does Bruce Willis, Monica Bellucci credit and I must add that the young man who played the surviving member of the slaughtered previous ruling household was excellent too, as were all the cast in fact.",1147132800,9,3133,4.442508710801394
1880600,5,B000096IBT,"This movie in NOT about action, even though there is plenty of action in it.

It is essentially about one man's journey (a Navy Seal) along the path he has taken away from his moral center and his ""humanity,"" which he discovers that he had lost and rediscovers it again while trying to save people from the all-too frequent ethnic cleansing that happens in Africa every day.

In the Bonus Features, you will find that this is a brilliant departure for Willis, who, upon learning about the ""Lost Boys"" of the Sudan and of the other horrors of civil unrest, war and butchery, WANTED to make this film realized by being a part of it and in true modest fashion, put his name on a ""war flick"" in the hopes of drawing a larger audience to the film that would normally avoid tales of tribal warfare in a land so far away that people are either too inundated by all the tragedy or are simply looking for He-man flicks.

If you are looking for ""Die Hard"" or other films of Bruce's previous ilk, this is not the film for you.

More than $5,000,000 in assets lost because his character had an emotional crisis?  That's a steep price to pay.  In the really real world, a deserved court martial would be awaiting Lt. Waters upon his return home.  Besides all of this, the military tactics, or lack thereof, in this movie must have been 'developed' by a blind monkey.

This is one action driven film that delivers an emotional gut-punch I was not expecting.  With amazing acting on the part of the entire cast, big names Willis and Bellucci but even down to the Nigerian villigers (real natives were used)...you can feel everyones emotions running strong throughout this film.  Willis plays a Navy seal whos sent into a hostile area of Nigeria to bring back an american doctor and the nuns and priest helping her care for the wounded villagers.  You see Nigeria is going through a bad time where groups of Nigerian soilders are performingan ethnic cleansing and killing off fellow tribes.  The film does good to show the humanity in men, showing how some lack all sorts of good, all sorts of morality while others have quite a bit, even though it may be hidden under a rough extierior.  Willis does a great job portraying a man finding himself.  He thought he knew who he was, thought he knew the man he really was until he saw all that he saw and it changed him.  Like his charactor says ""it's been so long since I've done the right thing""...To me the standout star is Monica Bellucci who just blew me away.  Rachel Weisz is getting all this attention for her performance in the Constant Gardener, and don't get me wrong because she did outstanding, but Monica gave an even more riviting and emotionally raw performance here and she recieved absolutly no oscar love.  I'd also recommend watching the extras here, the deleted scenes add a lot more to the emotional core oof the charactors and the commentaries with the actors and natives really shows the urgency for a film like this and the realness that can only be brought to the screen by men and women who've experienced these atrocitys...it's a devestating look at the living arrangments of those in Africa.  Like the film exposes...the only thing evil needs to tryumph is for good men to do nothing, and thats what this movie drives home and Willis risks his life and the lives of his men to do somthing, to make a difference...to do the right thing.

  However, I simply found it very hard to stay focused on this movie.  I wanted to, I really did.  I love war films, and always enjoy a good Bruce Willis movie.  He played his part here adequately I suppose, but I just wish there was a little more depth to him so I could have cared if he lived or died.  The film attempts to set up some character development early on, but ultimately fails as we never really get to know any of the brave Navy SEALS enough to start liking them for begrudgingly saving innocent people.

  Monica Bellucci is also satisfactory in her role of the good doctor who won't leave her patients behind to die, but satisfactory doesn't mean I enjoyed her performance.  If anything she came across as slightly unemotional.  And I have yet to figure out, what's up with her and Bruce Willis in this?  Are they potential love interests?  Is it just wishful thinking?  What do those long glances mean?  The film never digs beneath the surface here.

  I found the action sequences disappointing overall.  The assault on the village in the rain was well done, being the high point of the film for me.  The payoff at the end was just nonexistant.  Special effects were only decent, and paled in comparison to modern war films.  Let it be said, I am not a gorehound (I enjoy Gettysburg for all of its nongraphic violence as much as anybody), but I detest in films like these when instead of spending a little time to add some realism to the movie, the filmmakers opt to just have those extras pretend to be hit by bullets and fall over.  Any special effects director or CGI master can make something blow up on camera, but when there aren't even any squibs to point to as evidence of bullet wounds,I roll my eyes, especially in this day and age.  The battles were simply not rousing - I didn't feel apprehension, didn't sit back when the credits rolled and finally let my breath out, didn't have to remember to start blinking again.

  I am being slightly harsh with this movie, and I know it, mainly becaue I wanted it to be so good, and I suppose that is my fault for expecting too much.  If you take Tears of the Sun for what it is, an action movie with little character development and a happy ending, you won't be disappointed.  I must confess, I rented it once, was not overly impressed, and yet found myself watching it again a couple months later.  And if and when my war movie collection actually gets cooking, I wil eventually have to add Tears of the Sun to it.  Take that for what you will.",1137715200,3,3016,4.42

It's a gritty, hard look into the genocide of villagers in Central Africa by Nigerian soldiers. It is very emotional and heart wrenching for the soldiers who are following their leader without, at first, understanding him. Once scene particular hit home for me of the viciousness of what is happening. They come across a village where a woman lays screaming and bleeding because her chest has been cleaved so she can't feed her children.

The pretentious placement of an Edmund Burke quote (""All that is needed for the forces of evil to triumph is for enough good men to do nothing."") at the end of the film does nothing to place the Nigerian conflict in a historical context or provide a possible active role for the sympathetic viewer. It merely supports the apathy of the target audience: suburban Christian Republicans (note the subplot of Christian persecution in the Mission scenes). It also provides a fantasy image of the military-industrial complex as a humanitiarian force in order to resolve any tension the viewer may have about our current military adventures overseas.

1880606,3,B000096IBT,"This movie is about a Navy special forces team led by LT. Waters that is sent into Nigeria to evacuate an American doctor before rebel soldiers reach her camp.

Everything is going according to plan until the doctor refuses to leave with the soldiers unless they take all of the refugees she is caring for as well. Lt. Waters agrees and takes everyone on a long and difficult hike through the jungle to a landing zone where they are met by Navy helicopters. Lt Water's and his men get the doctor on a helicopter but abandon the refugees - who will most definitely be brutally killed by the approaching rebels.

As the helicopters fly away Lt. Waters has a change of heart and goes back for the refugees. This to me seemed unbelievable but if they hadn't turned around there would be no more to the movie.

Once on the ground with the refugees they have to make another long hike to the country's border and safety. This is where the movie falls apart in my opinion and starts to rely on many tired war movie cliches. A very small band of highly trained soldiers who are saving the weak and innocent face imposible odds against a HUGE and heavily armed enemy force. As is always the case in this type of movie the ""good guys"" are able to pick off dozens of enemy soldiers while remaining virtually immune to to the hundreds of men firing fully automatic rifles, grenades and rockets at them. Of course there is always a couple of lesser important ""good guy"" characters that get killed in order to keep the action level high. The fighting continues, with the enemy getting closer by the second as the Americans struggle to reach the border - it almost looks like they are not going to make it but not surprisingly air support (in the form of two heavily loaded F-18s) swoops in, fires some missiles and wipes out all the enemy soldiers in big crowd pleasing explosions.",1128902400,,1867,4.501474926253687

The only problem is that they are in the middle of a civil war and aren't allowed to engage the enemy who is hunting them down. Along the way, they learn that the last survivor of the royal family is among the group.  This just leads to more hard choices has they make a run for the border.

The story is pretty straighforward and nothing new. Soldiers have to rescue people, see genocide and defy their orders to help the people they feel for.

The first 50 mins of the movie are nothing special. Characters are flat (which they are supposed to be) and just do their job. Willis hasn't acted his best in this movie and no one in the movie (except for some of the African actors) really does.

The group has to flee and are being chased by a large group of 300 Nigerian soldiers, here the movie takes an interesting turn. It gets more exciting, deeper and you start wondering if they will eventually make it. Here is the hand of director Fuqua.

The scandal in Nigeria at this moment makes it a hot zone but Willis's character can't stand to watch all of these people die. He stays with his group of men to save them.

This movie contains a lot of good action scenes and many nice shootouts but it is very sad and is a drama/action movie.

1880614,3,B000096IBT,"Qualifies for a grade of three stars, otherwise, a mess from beginning to end... Here are ten - Count `em - ten (10) observations:

1. After the team has essentially accomplished the mission, the Bruce Willis character tells the pilot of the lead Blackhawk to take the whole team back to the point of extraction. The Blackhawk pilot complies without even uttering, ""What?!! Are you high?""

2. Once back on the ground in Nigeria, all the crew exit the aircraft with thousands of highly agitated and excited Nigerian kids armed with AK-47's and RPG's closing in. Incredibly, not one team member tries to kill or kick the living crap out of Willis.

3. Willis then loads up the helicopters with Nigerian civilians, who presumably will be taken to the USS Harry Truman. Once again, the chopper pilot meekly obeys the Godlike Willis.

4. Instead of bursting a blood vessel and sending someone out by helicopter to relieve him, or at the very least, ordering Willis to comply with the mission directive, the Tom Skerrit character issues the Willis character a stern warning, and basically tell him that what he is doing is not nice.

5. Willis and the team then take charge of the remaining group of civilians and lead them on a trek through triple canopy jungle, probably loaded with every sort of poisonous snake and varmint you can imagine. The Seals share their MRE's with the moms and kids, nobody gets any sleep for a couple of days, but like Merrill's Marauders or Wingate's Chindits, the group advances on schedule with remarkably few problems.

6. At one point, the group reaches an area where Nigerian troops are killing groups of hapless individuals in the name of ethnic cleansing. To it's credit, the film shows how a smaller, lightly armed, well trained unit might take on a larger group of poorly disciplined, poorly trained conscripts.

7. While most of the plotline is hokey, ""Tears of the Sun"" has a lot going for it in the way of visual imagery. That is, until the introduction of the CGI toward the end of the film. The F/18's looked too much like something from out of a video game. As far as I can imagine, they probably don't deliver payload that close to the ground. The overall effect of this aspect of the movie was pretty cheesy.

8. At 50, Bruce is getting a little long in the tooth to play a Lieutenant (That's O-3 for you non-squids) in the Navy, even as a Seal. By age 50, most have put in twenty-five or thirty years and have either retired or find work where they can use their knowledge and skills in other capacities.

9. The film's ending is slightly reminiscent of the old Gabby Hayes Westerns; When everything appears hopeless, the Cavalry arrives, unannounced.

10. Despite all the shortcomings of ""Tears of the Sun"", I watched the film all the way through. It wasn't a bad film, but it just wasn't very good. Despite the major flaw concerning the abandonment of the mission, the story progressed logically up to about three quarters of the way through the film.

1880616,3,B000096IBT,"Here is a worthless fact for you. Tear of the Sun was supposed to be Die Hard 4. It was taken from a book called Les Larmes du Soleil by Henri Vernes.

In ""Les Larmes du Soleil"", a plane in which the hero is travelling over South America is hijacked by rebels. They intend on asking for a ransom to the Governments of the countries of the 'white' passengers. The plane crashes and the hero escapes into the amazon. Soon he hooks up with a tribe of Aztec descendants and leads them away as the rebels are after them. This book was written as Die Hard 4 but Bruce Willis liked the title so much he agreed to do Die Hard 4 if he could use the Tears of the Sun title and script for a completely different movie.

Now it's about a group of Elite Navy SEALS given the simple sounding mission of rescuing a doctor (an American Citizen) from a jungle village in war-torn Nigeria as an Evil General seizes control of the country and imposes brutal ethnic cleansing. Not a pretty situation.

But as soon as Willis and his hardass SEALS (including Cole Hauser, Johnny Messner and Nick Chinlund) show up the stubborn Doctor (that's the lurv-ley Monica Bellucci) refuses to budge unless she can take 70 villagers with her. Willis lies, telling her that this is fine by him as long as she agrees to go. The choppers arrive, Bellucci freaks as Willis-calling him every name under the crying sun (!) as only she is escorted to safety. Minutes later they fly over the village to find that the rebels have massacred everyone. His conscience gets the better of him, he orders the choppers back and they lead the ditched villagers to the safety of the Camaroon border through 40 miles of jungle.

Trouble is, one of the villagers is a mole and someone else isn't who he says he is. As a result, what seems like every member of the Nigerian rebels go after them with about a bazillion bullets and rockets at their disposal.

The difficulty lies in the fact that Tears of the Sun both does and does not glorify war. You can't really tell if the film is gung-ho or serious. But there's something quite moving and noble about a bunch of hardened commandos willing to die for a cause they've not had enough time to understand. Soldiers are humans and are too often portrayed as killing machines. There is no entertainment in the combat, only a sense of real danger and hopelessness. I actually prefer this film to the Black Hawk Down because A) it's not a jumpy, jittery blur and B) there a subtler emotional investment. Subtlety is something Black Hawk Down did NOT have. You can argue that it hardly belongs in a war film but it does give Tears of the Sun a strange edge.

I have the Superbit DVD that has a brilliant 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen picture with a loud, dynamic Dolby/DTS 5.1 soundtrack. Get this version, it's only available in R2 at the moment so you'll have to import if you live outside the UK.",1109376000,3,2889,4.4517958412098295

The atrocities of what happens to these people caught up in a revolution are delivered with maximum impact and the cast does a good job despite the fact that we don't really get to know them.  Bruce Willis is staunch, heroic and compassionate; Monica Bellucci (Passion of the Christ) gives a riveting performance as the doctor; Cole Hauser, Johnny Messner, Eammon Walker, Paul Francis and all the seals perform with conviction and sensitivity.  The young lady who plays the doctor's best friend is especially convincing, I just can't spell her name!!!

I must say that this movie played on my emotions from the start. The scene of Africans hacking each other is just too brutal for me to handle. Finally, the whole plot strikes one as being absurd. The American Aristocracy (government)  cares nothing about Africa as it stands. I would venture to say that the writers of this movie used a lot of imagination to come up with the plot. Know why?

Bruce Willis leads a crack team of Special Ops into the Nigerian jungle to rescue a beautiful widowed female physician and reigious staff (priest and nuns) from a mission.  The doctor (Bellucci) won't leave without taking the people she's caring for who are able to walk with her.  Rescuing the refugees is contrary to Willis' orders.  He's just supposed to deliver the 'package' (Bellucci) and optionally the priest and nuns if they choose to come.  They march through the jungle for several hours' (or what seems like it) and then are 'extracted' by the helicopters.  The physician is not aware that she is the only person to be removed until the helicopter starts taking off without them.

Willis and his team are just following the orders they are given.  They're delivering the 'package' safely. That, in itself, is a risky mission.

When they pass over the mission and see it destroyed---something changes.  Willis orders the chopper back to the refugees they previously ditched, so they can march them to Cameroon.

I won't belabor the points the other people made.  While I have zero military experience, some of the strategy just doesn't make sense.  The acting was good for the most part---Bruce Willis is Bruce Willis as usual.  There's enough action to keep you riveted.

Waters, a Special Ops commander whose team is given the mission of rescuing an American Doctor Lena Kendricks (Monica Belluci) from a Nigerian village when that goverment collapses and the country is taken over by a ruthless dictator and his band of rebel soldiers.  Only trouble is that Kendricks refuses to leave unless they also rescue the group of villagers as well, leaving Waters and his team with a big decision:  do they do the humanitarian thing or do they obey direct orders?

Waters and his team decide to disobey orders.  They have a couple of choppers take out the kids and elderly and then decide to lead the remaining villagers on foot to the safety of the border of Cameroon.  Meanwhile a large contingent of rebel soldiers is hot on their trail, intent on killing them.  Along the way they encounter a village which has been almost totally wiped out by the ruthless rebels.  Waters and his team make quick work of the rebels, employing their best special-ops tactics to take them down quickly and quietly.  But how is it that the large rebel army seems to know their every move?

Willis is at the best he's been in a number of years as Waters who is not a gung-ho soldier, but a thoughful man torn between orders and doing what's right.  He tries to hide his compassion but he's swayed by the miserable plight of the villagers and knows they'll be dead unless he helps.

Belluci is fine as the stubborn doctor who simply won't leave the people to die, although she's just maybe a bit too good looking for the role.

My quick judgment turned out to be wrong and I definitely advise giving this movie a chance.  Director Antoine Fuque made a quite unique movie.  It is not based on a true story, which makes the theme much different that any type of war movie we have seen so far.

 Navy SEAL Lt. Waters, Bruce Willis, and his crew are sent on a mission to Africa to retrieve an American doctor running some type of aid for African people in need.  A group of rebel forces are in the area and when the ""village"" is found, it will definitely be destroyed.  When the doctor refuses to leave her patients, Willis has to battle his conscience over his orders.  He decides to take the patients with, but this makes the mission longer and much more difficult as the rebels close in.  In the beginning of the movie, Willis is portrayed as an unemotional guy who just wants to complete the mission and get out of there, but by the end Willis shows more emotion.

 The fight scenes are good and just enough blood to get the picture, but not totally gruesome.  The filming was good and there were no cheesy, fake scenes that just make you laugh.  Even though your imagination has to do the work of the gruesomeness, it has a powerful impact on the brutality of the rebels.

 As said before, it is not based on a true story, but things are happening like this in our world.  This movie makes you realize that not everyone has it as easy as us and some have to live in fear of being killed, really for no reason.  You come to feel for the African people and hope that the Special Forces team will be able to get them the intended destination.

 One thing I would liked to have seen was a better character development, especially in the patients that the doctor insists on saving.  I know they were running for their lives, but we could have seen some traditions or something of that the nature.  The only time you see this is at the end.  If there was more of a development, maybe you could feel for them a bit more and the movie would be that more interesting.

 I think this movie is very good.  It is different than what we are used to seeing.  The movie is wrapped with so much emotion that it is hard not to enjoy it.",1097452800,11,2362,4.239910313901345

One of my favorite lines in the movie is when Bruce Willis says, ""God has already left Africa."" There is so much turmoil there that most of the world never sees, even though it's all happening in plain sight.

Mercifully, most of the bloodiest killing and violence are implied, so the viewer doesn't actually see as much gore as was possible. Thank the director for that--your imagination will have no problem filling in the details. The movie does a very good job of showing the brutality of rebel invasions. Although the movie is set in Nigeria it could just as easily be Rwanda, Somalia, Congo, or Sudan. If you've ever been unsure about why African refugees are being resettled in the United States, Canada and Europe, see this movie and you'll understand.

Many of the refugee characters in the film were portrayed by actual refugees who were resettled here through the UNHCR program. Director Antoine Fuqua did an amazing thing--he actually interviewed these people and had them tell their own stories of fleeing war and persecution. The ""making of"" featurette is also worth your time, and the producer, director, and principal cast members talk about why they made this movie. The motivation always went beyond just making another action flick. There's a conscience in this movie, and it's as much about raising awareness as it is about action and suspense.",1095292800,5,1719,4.860068259385666
1880628,5,B000096IBT,"Its good to see a moveo that depicts SEALS's somewhat realistically.

I liked this movie despite having a few minor problems with it.

It reminded me of an old movie called The Wild Geese with Richard Burton, Roger Moore, Richard Harris and every ohter macho dude from the mid 70's about a small band of mercenaries escaping from a much larger force across Africa trying to save a deposed president.

Tears of the Sun hade excellent photography, a killer D5.1 track and the best techical direction I have ever seen in this type of film.

These days movies with Navy SEALs have been somewhat overdone, but so far none of them have really shown SEAL tactics with anything approaching realism. Throughout the movie I can not remember nay one actually even saying the word SEAL only ""I'm Lt Waters from the US Navy."" SEALs know who they are, their commanders know no one else is important. Very nice touch.

For a student of SEAL tactics pay careful attention to the village scene where Waters and his men take out a squad of rebels engaged in wholesale slaughter. This scene was realistic, taut, quick and efficient - SEAL trademarks. Pay attention folks, and Hollywood - this is how it is done. Also a very satisfying scene.

When the group encounters patrol of rebels in the jungle I suppose many directors and screenwriters would have had the SEAL's wipe then out which they could have done easily, but in the real world with real SEALs they would have done just as shown. The technical director obviously knows and understands SEAL tactics, missions as well and how to use SEALS to best advantage. The only problem was a SEAL of Waters' experience would have never been surprised by the straggler bringing up the rear - he would have assumed there was one and expected him.

Even when faced with being overrun with a vastly numerically superior force the film depicts them using SEAL tactics to great effect: fast and furious, lots of rounds expended 6 guys making war like 60.

The problems I had with the film are relatively minor. First Bruce is a little long in the tooth to be playing a mere Lt. in a SEAL platoon. At his age he should have been cast more appropriately in Tom Skeritts role, but of course that wouldn't be quite as much fun for a superstar of Willis' status.

The other was Willis' portrayal of Waters through most of the film. He was totally deadpan and reminded me of Kurt Russell's Soldier - flat and emotionless - a bred killer trained from birth. I can see him being a serious player and a man of few words but Bruce looked more like a robot than a SEAL commander. Only near the end did he start to show some emotion and stress. I should have come much earlier in the film.

Other minor issues such a Willis disobeying orders and returning to rescue the refugees I have less of a problem with. In his position it would not be unprecedented to make a field decision of this sort.

All in all I am happy to have this film in my collection. I'll put it right next to my copy of The Wild Geese.",1093996800,4,3018,4.479052823315119
1880629,4,B000096IBT,"Navy seals are beginning to sicken me. It's the same old thing: white boys go into a country of color, dominate, crack jokes and get out unscathed. This theme again presents itself in ""Tears of the Sun,"" where Bruce Willis and his crew are out to save some folks and get them to safety even as supposed ""ethnic cleansing"" is taking place in Nigeria. It matters not that the great young actor Isaiah Washington is part of the troupe or that Willis appears to be some kind of liberal (just as he was when he and Samuel L. Jackson made that joke of a sequel, ""Die Hard With a Vengeance""). The fact is, white folks cannot fight guerilla warfare and the war in Iraq should convince them of that. And yet these movies keep getting cranked out, the wihte man saving the po' cullud folk from de oppressor. There is never any mention about the oppression that is taking place in the home of the special ops leadership; he is just presumed to be the updated version of Jesus Christ and ""he's here to help us."" Yeah, right. Feeding off the sickening wave of patriotism that is circulating around America (code name: racism), this movie and others like it are well received because this is a natoin of warmongers. But the fact is, the black man and the Latino are put on the front lines, sent to ""take the point"" or ""cover the rear."" Like the undeserving General Patton, the mediocre platoon leader or captain takes all the credit. There should be a movie called, ""Ask the Brothers."" THen you would find out about what really takes place during this ""special ops"" missions. At that point you'd see more than tears of the ""sun;"" you'd also see tears of the daughter, the mama and the daddy too: just before being rounded up, put in a ditch and fired upon. Remember?

This movie should be seen - but not for the reasons you think.",1093651200,,1816,4.453453453453453
1880630,4,B000096IBT,"OK, I'd like to start off by saying that I've seen a few  opinions regarding this movie here (mainly political), and let's try to remember that this IS only a movie! Sure, maybe this isn't the way Africa or Nigeria really is, and maybe it's not true-to-life...but, again, it's a MOVIE! It's for entertainment purposes! All that aside, let's focus on the ""movie"".

The movie itself features Bruce Willis in probably one of his best acting performances. (One of his most realistic roles) Even the other actors & actresses did a fine job in this movie.

Like others, I thought this movie would have gotten WAY better reviews from film critics, but, it didn't. Considering this movie was well acted, and well produced, and had all the elements needed to make a good movie! Action, great acting, decent plot, drama, heroism, plus, it could even jerk a tear or two from a viewer.....etc....Not too bad if you ask me!

OK, even I can agree that the ending was a little unrealistic (final showdown), but again....it's a movie! That's Hollywood for ya'....That's what Hollywood does.....

Overall, I loved the movie, and thought it was well thought-out, I found it alot better than most war movies, and it was one of Bruce Willis' best acting roles to date.",1093478400,7,1248,4.7592592592592595
1880631,5,B000096IBT,"For those capable of putting aside their left/liberal or right/conservative agendas and knee-jerk reactions this movie should be a real treat. If there ever was a film about a Campbellian hero-and-companions journey into and out of the heart of darkness, this is it. It's not set in some fantasy land far away or long ago, of course, but in the present day and context, with the bad guys being easily recognizable for who they are, and no apologies made for it. Director Antoine Fuqua ('The Replacement Killers', 'Training Day', 'King Arthur') makes no bones about where he stands (the DVD commentary confirms this without a doubt), and Bruce Willis isn't exactly known for his liberal political views. So the tenor is definitely anti-war, but not anti-military; in a similar way, one might say, as ""Black Hawk Down' was, though Tears of the Sun is much more personal and intimate in every way.

Some of the scenes are brutal and disturbing; at least I found them to be so. But they were not gratuitous, but necessary. The heart of darkness is, after all, darkness. The hero and his companions journeyed there, because he chose a path to humanization, prompted onto it by, who else?, a woman. The romantic element is understated, deliberately muted, and could even be dismissed as peripheral. But it isn't. Without it there would have been no path to the redemption of all the soldiers involved.

The scene after the fight with those who were slaughtering the villagers - where Willis stands alone, looking around him, at the mountains, the burning village, the dead, wounded, and the living trying to help, underscored by Hans Zimmer's mounrful score - it's easily one of the most powerful I've ever seen; carrying within it too many layers of content and meaning to easily analyze.

1880632,1,B000096IBT,"I read your review about the movie ""TEARS OF THE SUN"" that starred BRUCE WILLIS amongst others ,but i think i like the way you all expressed your views.

I am an 18-year-old Nigerian and i have lived in  Nigeria all my life and i must not fail to tell you that i have never experienced war and violence before,but i learn't that before i was born the biafran war was fought in which thousands of people from my

tribe(igbo) were killed, we the igbo are mainly christians  and 70% of igbos are catholics.

In recent years, before i was bornthe igbo people fought for independence from the clutches of the fulanis and the hausas who are mainly muslims and believed in violently killing and wiping out oppositions claiming they were  fighting what they call ""holywar"" my people couldn't bear this and tried to declare ""THE REPUBLIC OF BIAFRA"" but all their efforts were to no avail as the hausas and the fulanis under the military didctator YAKUBU GOWON,were being backed by the U.S and the BRITISH forces, all these happened in the 1970's, about 10 years after NIGERIA's independence, till now the igbo people still clamour for independence but they want in peacefully.

In essence, what i'm trying to point out is that;considering africa in general, NIGERIA is not as violent as it is being thought outside the shores of NIGERIA, because peace has being restored along time ago even before i was born, what we have now in Nigeria are  meagre ethnic clashes which only surfaces in a moment only to die off after a day or two and if you disagree with me, why don't you  visit other african countries like Burundi,Sudan,Libya,Liberia .et al where rebels never die. You will agree with me that  meagre clashes happens everwhere in the world even in U.S and Britain where we all agree are the most peacefull countries in the world.

According to U.N estimation Nigeria has about 133 million people and 250 DIFFERENT ethnic tribes with different religions and now it's obvious why tolerance will most likely fail to prevail but in spite of all these Nigeria can still boast of being one of the most peaceful nations in Afica.

Actually, i don't want to sound so patriotic that i mislead or misinform people about happenings in Nigeria, but with due respect to all who have a hand in the production of

that movie, i think that they (Americans) where so innovative that they damaged the sense of belonging of the  common Nigerian who PEACEFULLY wakes up in the morning , goes out for his daily duties and comes home SAFELY to return to return to his bed, thereby giving him a trauma for being a Nigerian. It is really sad to see that they have nothing else to talk about Nigeria than violence, war, rape, and so on.

I have been to virtually all parts of Nigeria and i know what peace in  Nigeria is all about, so i want to inform anyone who reads this coloumn that now Nigeria is not as violent as it is painted in the movie""TEARS OF THE SUN"" and with due respect, that everything done about Nigeria in that movie are all false and unreal.",1092873600,13,3032,4.556169429097606
1880633,2,B000096IBT,"This Bruce Willis action drama starts out pretty convincingly as Navy Seals are sent on an extraction detail to evacuate an American doctor played by Monica Bellucci from the jungle of Nigeria.

  The film accurately depicts the tribal strife that plagues most African nations to this day. The movie also isn't shy about depicting the type of brutality that takes place on a daily basis in these civil conflicts. Monica Bellucci is convincing in playing the missionary wanting to join the saintly martyr cause. Even Bruce Willis is somewhat credible in portraying a disciplined commando who's conscience is his greatest enemy.

  The movie's realism fails in the final extraction where you have a squad of men fighting off a battalion of guerrilas. I realize that a few men have often fought great odds with success but this is simply absurd. At one point it seemed as if modern fighting had retrograded to Civil War tactics where men form a compact line formation and charge a whole batallion of men with RPGs and automatic weapons: ridiculous. And finally of course, as with all films of this type, the cavalry comes to save the day at the end and everybody is joyous: Yeepie Kiay!

  Seeing this movie once is quite enough. The more you watch it the more it will remind you of Rambo III or some long forgotten Chuck Norris film.",1090454400,4,1331,4.752173913043478
1880634,3,B000096IBT,"You can't really call ""Tears of the Sun"" a bad movie. By any account it's certainly a decent action war movie, and I enjoyed it. Where ""Tears of the Sun"" fails to succeed is in it's somewhat one-dimensional and shallow aproach at including policical and social messages, and in it's seeming impotence at crossing the lines from mediocrity to greatness.
The plot is pretty much a no brainer that gets set up right from the get-go. The Democratic government in Nigeria gets ousted by a military coup and rebel forces execute the presidential family and begin an genocidal killing spree, killing christians and rival tribes. Bruce willis and his small special forces team is sent to to find and evacuate several US Citizens, including a doctor working at a christian mission. The doctor won't leave without her patients, and so Willis and his team agree to escort the people to the Cameroon border. Of course they are followed by the rebels the whole way and are grossly outnumbered and it becomes a race to get to the border and to safety before they are completely over run.
Not exactly full of surprises and not much food for thought. of course there is the initial lie/double cross, and then the classic (not to mention very cliche) moment where our heroes grow a conscience after witnessing the horrors and extent of ethnic cleansing that is taking place and decide to help the people as thier way of making amens with thier own guilty consciences. other than this there is little to talk about plot-wise.
The acting is pretty good, although it varies throughout. Willis himself does a very good job playing his charcter though other than him and the doctor none of the characters grew on me. The setting is great, and the shots of the african landscape were very nice. For being an action war movie, ""Tears of the Sun"" offered only sporadic action until the climatic battle at the end which was mildy impressing, though nothing you haven't scene before.
There is a constant attempt throughout the movie to bring attention to the brutality the ethnic cleansing that occurs in Africa that most americans are unaware of. We hear about bosnia, kosovo, but not so much about the many war torn regions in africa many of which are subject to constant guerilla warfare, famine, tribal clashes, and civil wars. The current attention being given to the situation in Sudan is very similar to what is shown in the movie. The look we are given however, although sad and mildly graphic, is a little one dimensional, and doesnt really explore the complexity of the political, ethnic, and religious angles of african conflicts. instead this is all reduced to ""good guys vs bad guy"" with the US as the good guys who sit idley by of course. I think many people will wish that the movie had a more realistic and more complete look at this angle of the plot rather than just showin ""a bunch of rebel guys in red hats who run around killing all the christians and guys from the other tibes"".
Other than that there is an overwhelming lack of depth and substance to the movie. Character development was underdone and there just aren't many layers beyond what you see on the surface. And what is on the surface, though not bad, is not spectacular either. While I liked the movie over all, it just didn't have enough meat to it I felt. There were times I would just feel like something I couldn't put my finger on was missing to this one.
""Tears of the sun"" does win points however for atleast trying to shed some public light to the attrocities in africa that most of the world lives happily ignorant to. It also serves as an effective, and enjoyable military action movie that is hard to hate but impossible to love.",1089417600,,3696,4.644274809160305
1880635,3,B000096IBT,"I really have quite ambivalent felings about this movie. From one hand, it's full of cliches and very simpleminded. You pretty much know what will happen, a lot of things are overdramatized (not the scenes of atrocities though). The acting is mediocre but it's not a problem of actors but rather of a bad script. On the other hand, the scenes of atrocities in the movie (somewhere in Africa - Sudan comes right away to mind) make people to realize that such terrible things are really happening today. It did really resonate through probably some shock - at least that's the way I feel. And who knows, maybe a simplemindness of this movie helps to deliver the message. I would give one star for cinematographic qualities and five stars for revealing the problem and showing disasters really happening in the world today.",1089331200,2,820,4.78169014084507

Bad tactics, bad acting, and just poor story.  They all died about the start of the ""big battle"", somehow walking out in the B-movie end. Total science fiction.  Sorry, that was just too much.  And Why?  No one to write a realistic script?  Ran out of ideas?  What a waste for the budget and huge effort.  Thats my take.

A very necessary exposure for the world as it sits back and watches a great nation destroyed.
The direction is excellent, war scenes mixed with touches of humanity and nature giving a sense of what people are fighting over. Some of the acting is a bit overdone, but then what other reason is there to watch a Bruce Willis movie? The most touching scenes are unfortunately the most brutal, the slaughter of towns, the piles of dead bodies, innocents pleading for life and the factual account of women being raped by militias who ""de-breast"" them so that future generations are deprived of something as simple as a mother's milk.
I highly recommend this film for the horror it provokes and try to imagine the nations of Africa pleading for their lives while our fat and happy nation only fights for oil. Shouldn't war be about saving lives? This movie says it all....the right way.",1087171200,4,1105,4.730569948186528

Don't get me wrong he is great in others but he also isn't in others. The casting for this film was pretty good, every one was real belivable. Antonie Fuqua did a good job directing it, and Alex Lasker & Patrick Cirillo wrote a good script. But the thing that made this film so good was that it was very bloody, and was also so depressing to see these people in the villiges being tortured and killed. Why is that good you ask, well it's because that is what really happens. The harsh reality of it is that those things really happen, in fact it's probably happing right now. All the extras in this film were crying on set because it brought back memories. On a better note the setting in Hawai was a great choice for location, it looks like the real places in Africa.

Second, this is a great story with first rate direction. It is patently an action movie that ""cares"" about people, and does a very good job of explaining why. The director does a great job of doing this by creating characters we care about in an intriguing plot, and avoids preachiness. I thought this was a great performance by all the actors, especially Bruce Willis whose character is laconic but nonetheless conveys the conflict raging between obedience to orders and a moral imperative to protect the helpless. Finally, I would advise that this movie depicts brutality and violence with frankness, and it is also suspenseful so I would not recommend this as ""mere entertainment"".

When they arrive, the female missionary refuses to go unless Willis brings the 70 Nigerian nationals with.  Orders are orders, and Willis' team prepares to extract only the woman they have clearance for.  However...the horrors of seeing the bloodbath, and the reality of what will happen if Willis obeys his orders overwhelms him, and he chooses another course.  What follows is a chase through the countryside that becomes unexpectedly intense.  People die, and a few of the nationals are not who they seem to be (for good and evil).
Tears of the Sun (a clever title by the way) has strong, bloody action.  It moves quickly, and logically.  There are a few surprises, but, in the end this is a straight-forward production.  The ""crisis of conscience""  so many reviewers have mentioned actually gets resolved fairly quickly, and as one would expect of a Hollywood production.  The action is realistic, and does not glorify the necessary violence--a plus!  Willis' brooding is key in this aspect.
Bottom-line:  Tears of the Sun is a solid action movie, with just enough personal conflict to give it reasonable depth.  The Nigerian characters are treated with dignity, and the story ends on a somber, yet optimistic note.  I just kept sensing that something was missing.  I kept waiting.  Was Willis carrying some dark secret about a past mission gone bad?  Was the missionary lady somehow involved in the country's politics?  (After all, why send a team of highly-skilled soliders to extract one civilian missionary?) Was the U.S. government somehow implicated?  Most of those questions went unanswered.

1880655,5,B000096IBT,"Eight Navy Seals get a rough assignment: Pull an American doctor out of war-torn Nigeria. The mission becomes much more complicated and difficult when the doctor refuses to leave her charges. Willis, as the lieutenant commanding the squad, has to make life-and-death choices and the allow his humanity to surface or, as he says, he learns to ""give a f*ck"". Willis uses his ""Die Hard"" style, with little opportunity for humor. There really isn't any room here for humor. It is dark, tense and scary. And there is also the triumphant, mostly rewarding and credible climax.
There is more development and tension than violence and action for much of the film. The minutes of violence are heart wrenching and not overly gratuitous. Explicit, graphic violence comes with a message, even if you choose to dismiss it. For a moment, I though there might be a neat, simple and clean ending possible, but the director (who first made ""Training Day"") was too honest. There is also a small political twist that adds some heart and sense of revival to the devastation trailing the small group trying to make their way from the medical mission to safety in Cameroon.
To be political and personal for a moment, I was moved. A few good men can make a difference, and not the way Rob Reiner portrayed them. Sure, this is Hollywood and creative license is what often makes art and entertainment. But Michael Moore was much less honest with ""Bowling for Columbine,"" and he won an Academy Award for his ""documentary"". ""Tears of the Sun"" is a more honest view of, as the director says, ""man's inhumanity to man.""As Willis says in the accompanying feature, when it comes to internecine warfare in Africa, ""It all depends upon who has the guns.""

Caring what happens to the government of this larcenous nation is difficult to do.
The bad guys chase the good guys, because, unbeknownst to the SEALS, one of the refugees is the son of the murdered Nigerian president.  He's been hiding behind a screen of innocent people rather than running for the border. Then for some mysterious plot device he's also revealed to be the ""heritary chief of the Ibo tribe."" The refugees start acting reverent but he's done nothing to earn such respect.
The bad guys close in because a refugee traitor has a transmitter.  He's killed and his booby-trapped body AND THE TRANSMITTER are left behind.  No good guy takes it to lead the bad guys in the wrong direction.
The fearful refugees, with no training that made it to the screen, pick up weapons and begin shooting at the bad guys.  In some scenes the SEALS are BETWEEN the bad guys and the refugees.  Thugs with guns on one side, civilians with guns on the other side, SEALS in the middle.
The lady doctor character serves no other function than to fuss at Bruce Willis for the hard way he's pushing them toward safety.

It still had the requisite shoot outs and last stand vs the thousands of well-dressed Nigerian rebels (those are proably the best dressed and armed rebels I have ever seen in a movie!).

1880658,5,B000096IBT,"5 reasons i love this movie
1- Great location
shot in Hawaii but incredibly representative of the Nigerian jungle aka African jungle/Heart of Darkness (copyright - Hollywood marketing material/Joey Boy Conrad) - did you see that yawning Mandrill . Reminds me of safaris i took when i was younger - well actually, that was the Kenyan jungle and the South African jungle. But seen one African Jungle, you've seen them all - did i mention the yawning Mandrill.
2 - Factual accuracy
Could someone in Hollywood let Nigerian President Obasanjo know
a) that the Nigerian Civil war did not end in 1970 but unbeknownst to him is still raging on
b) that he is no longer Yoruba but Ibo (heck one African tribe is as good as the other, least Hollywood research turned up a Nigerian ethnic group, he could have been made Masai you ingrates)
c) to rename his country (sounds too much like Liberia) - must be easier to do that than to research one of the numerous real life conflicts in African countries that might provide equally worthwhile drama, stuff blowing up and the added benefit of not trivialising tragedy as fairy tale.
d) that Nigerians are the new Kenyans - heck they ran all night tracking Brucie's men didn't they. There is even a quote in the movie to support this, anyhow they all track kudu all night anyway - what noble lungs they all have.
Also, all occurences of american characters in movies emphasising their native-loving credentials by passing off gobbledegook as ""native"" language were kept to a minimum. And NONE were passed off with meaningless subtitles
3) Dramatic complexity & Character depth
the moral dilemma associated with the conflict portrayed was stunning. Kinda reminded me of Platoon actually and the whole moral dilemma thing of Vietnam but you know in a movie-about-a-tribal-conflict kinda way. The range of emotion displayed by Noble African Native Woman Screaming A Lot on Her Way To Meet Her Baby (that's her real name - kinda like the injuns - but her friends call her NANWSALOHWTMHB) was quite remarkable. There was one scene where the utterly hopeless look on her face conveyed the tragedy of a nation looking down on the symbolic hacked off - can-no-longer-nuture - dreams of future generations - looking down on Noble African Native Women With Breasts Hacked Off After Being Raped (formerly known as Noble African Native Women With Breasts Flapping On Pages of the Nat. Geographic) (thats her real ... u know the drill).
4) Opportunities for new actors
Nothing like a film about AFRICA!! (""faint Tribal Drums in the background, fade to black"") to provide loads of roles and greatly needed opportunities to play black, for blacks in the movie industry (ethnic ones for that matter). Credits included Jonas Olumo who played Jonas (don't know who that was? shame on you for not paying attention) and Man With Goat who played Man With Goat.
5) Social Reengineering -
for those who were immediately resigned to the curious appeal Hollywood has of making sure romantic interests are paired off neatly along America's racial lines (i.e. meaningful scene laden with potential romance b/w Eamonn Walker aka Da Black Seal and NANWSALOHWTMHB), this film pushed the envelope with the scene where the non-Eamonn Walker Seal died saving Noble African Native Woman Straggler Gagging To Be Killed and expired lovingly on her backside.

1880660,5,B000096IBT,"Reading and writing are two of the most enjoyable pass-times that I have. Another entertainment medium that I enjoy as often as possible, is movies. Last night I had the pleasure to view, for the first time, ""Tears of the Sun"" starring Bruce Willis, (A.K. Waters), portrays a Special OPS Commander who enters the war torn wilds of Nigeria to retrieve Dr. Lena Hendricks, (Monnica Bellucci) before disaster strikes the missionary where she works. Refusing to leave with Waters unless any and all able bodied patients are allowed to come with her, Waters is faced with a conscientious decision. A conscientious decision Waters has  never allowed himself to face before. The value of a human life and the fact that he really does care. At first, bent on treachery and successfully performing his mission, Waters leads the cumbersome troupe through a rugged and harsh terrain in order to reach the prearranged L Z. Along their way, both Waters and his men discover something about themselves and the people who have placed their lives in their hands. What transpires is visually graphic and often horrific. But War truly is Hell on Earth.
If you're looking for a movie with a happy ending, this isn't the movie for you. But if you want to see a Hollywood version of the Hell that War truly is, and what the real life victims of a war torn country must face on a daily basis, this is the movie for you.
Willis has never been an actor to do a tap dance around the harsh reality of life. Though the man does have a humorous side, as we've seen in the movie ""Blind Date"", a rollicking flick also starring Kim Basinger. This is one of my all time favorite movies, ever made. If you haven't seen it, see it soon. You won't regret spending the money. Another favorite of mine, which Willis himself admits to being one of his few box office failures is ""Hudson Hawk"". Again if you love the humorous side of Willis, this movie is a must see. One my children and I enjoy watching together. ""Hudson Hawk"" is a box office hit at my house.",1069459200,3,2022,4.554945054945055
1880661,4,B000096IBT,"I think it is a bad tendency of some media to seek for any political agenda in American blockbuster movies.  If you share  that kind of idea, please don't watch this one.  It's not about American foreign deplomacy; it's about the soldiers who have to maintain their humanity among the most harsh reality of war.  And it's about Bruce Willis, who gives one of his best performances of the career.
Actually, it is too obvious that the film was made for him, originally intended for the fourth ""Die Hard"" installment.  But this time Bruno plays Lieutenant A K Waters, commander of Special Ops team, who has to rescue ONLY Dr. Lena Kendricks from the church in Nigeria played by Monica Bellucci.  The doctor knows it is dangerous to stay on, and that they are being surrounded by rebel armies, but as she dedicates herself to the people there, she refuses his help.
The following story is rather simple; Waters agrees to take the refugees with her, but you know that kind of promise will inevitably compromise the mission itself, and involve the whole troop with unnecessary dangers.  And it does.
The most amazing thing about ""Tears of the Sun"" is Bruce Willis.  He is really great as the reluctant hero.  Though his character (and others' too) is paper-thin, he infuses substantial weight into it, with dignity and professionalism.  And I mean professionalizm of the actor's own.  Other actors are all noteworthy, in particular, Cole Hauser as ""Red"" who assists the chief with a really cool attitude.
Compared to them, female parts should be called weak.  Bellucci is beautiful as ever, and not bad, but I still don't know her casting is the best choice for the film.  And most unaccountable thing is that you see a glimpse of Fionnula Flanagan, whose chilling performace was very memorable in ""Others.""  We see her name in credit, but she virtually does nothing.
The script is not perfect, especially the opening and ending part, where you can notice many plot holes (for instance; Why Character A  appears the gate again when she should be most likely somewhere else?)  But the combat scenes are competently done, and if the presented situation is nothing unique, it is saved by good acting from the cast, and beatifully photographed rain forest scenes which succeeds in bringing the humid air to the screen.  (In fact, it was shot in Hawaii, though.)  And the scenes that capture the horrible truth about civil wars in Africa (or any other land) are hauntingly convincing.
In short, ""Tears of the Sun"" is a good example of a story we all know, but still well-told.  As such, it is worth watching.",1067040000,4,2597,4.769574944071588
1880662,4,B000096IBT,"Tears of the Sun is hardly perfect. Director Antoine Fuqua's direction can get a bit heavy-handed and most of the characters are one to two-dimensional in development (understandable, given the large cast). But it's a solidly made, often thrilling and sometimes thought-provoking film that aims for serious issues, particularly as a sober outlook of modern warfare and morals. It's not entirely successful at the latter, but to even attempt to stray from typical Hollywood is admirable, and Tears of the Sun is often more hit than miss.
Bruce Willis stars as A.K. Waters, the head of a mission to retrieve a Dr. Lena Hendricks (Monica Bellucci) from the Nigerian jungle, after Muslim rebels have just assassinated the presidential family, and are on a rampage throughout the country. Hendricks is located easily, but she will only leave so long as all able-bodied individuals on her mission can come along. Waters reluctantly agrees, but soon finds that he and his group must trek the jungles with no assistance and with 300 Nigerian soldiers hot on their trail.
Tears of the Sun works as a thoughtful film, but is more successful as a tension-builder. Director Fuqua shows an able hand at building suspense to a feverish pitch, all the way to the concluding battle sequence, a fifteen minute setpiece that rivals any recent war film in both intensity and technical superiority. The other major action setpiece is a tense shootout in a village, the aftermath of which is disturbing in its revelation of the rebels' treatment of civilians. Tears of the Sun is a violent film, but never exploitative in its approach.
The film's two best developed characters belong to Bruce Willis and Monica Bellucci. Willis has always been a fine actor, this understated approach has worked for him before and fits like a glove here. I'm not quite as familiar with Bellucci, who I've only seen in Brotherhood of the Wolf and as one of the brides in Bram Stoker's Dracula, but she's quite good here, easily the film's anchor when it comes to heart and warmth. I'm certainly not exaggerating when I say she's one of the most beautiful (and bodacious) women to ever grace the screen (and I look forward to her in the upcoming Matrix sequels).
There are flaws, such as the rather obtrusive musical score and some pretentious use of slow motion on Fuqua's behalf. The film's biggest narrative stumble comes with a plot twist 3/4's through the movie, when an extraneous plot twist is revealed. Admittedly, without the twist, the film wouldn't have been able to build up as much suspense, much less deliver that final battle. But when all is said and done, Tears of the Sun is highly recommended, a Hollywood film that has more on its mind than explosion and gunfights (which the movie still has an ample amount of).

1880663,3,B000096IBT,"TEARS OF THE SUN starts out as an actioner for star Bruce Willis, but soon morphs into an introspective soul-searching film that disguises itself in a series of bloody jungle ambushes.  Director Antoine Fuqua presents an image of Africa that has become increasingly commonplace in the media, a continent rent with tribal internicene warfare that degenerates into genocidic ethnic cleansing.  Fuqua chooses Nigeria as the background for some truly horrific tribal slaughtering.  The elected president, his cabinet, and his family have all been executed by advancing rebels who do not pause to kill anyone found in their path.  Monica Belluci is Doctor Lena, a good-hearted woman who chooses to tend to the suffering of a tormented population.  With her is a priest, Father Gianni (Pierrino Mascarino) and a nun Sister Grace (Fionnula Flanagan), all of whom choose to remain in harm's way rather than abandon some 70 wounded natives.  Enter Bruce Willis as Lt. A. K. Waters, who is ordered to enter Nigeria with his Special Ops team to extricate only Doctor Lena.  Waters and his team find Doctor Lena, but she refuses to go with them unless her 70 wounded can go too.  Most reluctantly, Waters agrees to this change of orders.  Until this point, Waters is a strictly by the book officer, one who regards this war, this country, and its natives as irrelevant to his mission.  But he cannot close his eyes to the ubiquitous suffering to which he has a ringside seat.  He surprises Doctor Lena, and probably himself as well, by making a genuine effort to extricate the entire group of helpless natives.
TEARS OF THE SUN is a violent film filled with both disturbing images of jungle battle and the even more malific glimpse into the depths of sadism and inhumanity that seemingly reside within the collective breasts of all the rebel commanders.  Malick Bowens as rebel Colonel Sadick is especially convincing as one who is as equally determined as is Lt. Waters to complete his own mission but allows not his conscience to bother him in the least.  To Colonel Sadick, natives of his own country, but of a different tribe, are disposable people.  As a moral counterbalance to Sadick, Sammi Rotibi as Arthur Azuka, the son of the slain president, is the reincarnated collective soul of his bitterly abused people, most of whom see in him the restored dignity of a once proud Nigeria.  TEARS OF THE SUN suggests that the evil and insanity of ethnic cleansing is a moral disease that, far from being an epidemic, afflicts only those who are predisposed to violence.  Lt. Waters and Arthur Azuka remind the audience that for good to triumph, brave men must show their bravery, not to an armed enemy wearing a different uniform, but more to their own kind ordering them to commit acts that differ from those of the rebels more in degree than in kind.  The tears of the son that are being shed for his people are constant reminders that this sort of bravery cannot be assumed to exist in any great quantity.",1065484800,3,2997,4.799610894941634

To me, this film is everything that ""Windtalkers"", ""Behind Enemy Lines"", ""Hart's War"", and ""Pearl Harbor"" should have been.  ""Tears of the Sun"" is bursting with fine acting, stunning cinematography, a beautiful score, a moving script, and realistic combat that, mercifully, isn't mind numbing.
When the democratic government of Nigeria collapses and the country is taken over by a brutal military dictator, Navy SEAL Lieutenant A.K. Waters (Bruce Willis), a fiercely loyal and hardened veteran is dispatched on a routine mission to retrieve Dr. Lena Kendricks from a Catholic mission in a remote village where she is caring for victims of the endless civil war.
However, when Waters and his elite squadron arrive, Dr. Kendricks refuses to leave unless he promises to help deliver the villagers to safety at the nearby border. If the villagers are left behind, they will be at the mercy of the massive rebel army. Waters is under strict orders from his commanding officer Captain Bill Rhodes (Tom Skerritt) to remain disengaged from the conflict.
As Waters and his men witness the brutality of the rebels first-hand, they are moved by Dr. Kendricks' cause and place their lives at risk by agreeing to escort the villagers on a perilous trek through the dense jungle to the safe ground just past the border.
The reality of this serious issue in Nigeria is quite frightening.  When I was watching it, I sat back and thought ""Wow.  This is really happening to people.  It's not made up.""

I really wanted to like this movie, for the director of Traning Day teaming up with Bruce Willis, to take us into another 'Heart Of Darkness' is something to follow with interest, sadly this was not the case, for several reasons:
1-With lines like 'God has already left Africa' or 'If we continue to slow down we will move backwards in time (??!!), the dialogue is pretty lame.
2-The first half of the movie is very slow and weak, and if you expect a thrilling warfare action that will cover the flaws in the script as in Black Hawk Down, you will be disappointed. And the flaws in the script are many,for instance we get no convincing reason why Willis's character changes his mind in mid air and goes back to help the other stranded people, who were still standing in the exact spot where he left them.(!!)
3-Monica Bellucci, as delightfully sexy and talented as she is, and who was great in Malena, Asterix and Cleopatra and Irreversible, was in my opnion miscat for this movie. It needs some effort to believe her as this doctor working in some monestary in the heart of the African jungle. In addition to that, Bruce Willis has a tired expression on his face throughout the film, and he does seem a tight uncomfortable.
4-The political side of the film is ridden with cliches. The images of rape and murder,especially the murder of the priest by the rebels, whose leader look at the cross around the priest's neck before ordering his murder,is harrowing as any images of war are, but they are too sentimental to have the desired impact. Thin Red Line, Deer Hunter and to a lesser extent Platoon and Black Hawk Down succeed much more in showing the brutality and effects of war on both soldiers and civilians.

Very good and very fake story with very unrealistic and too made up script. Actors doing excellent job, but has nothing really to go with. Their characters are too fake.
I even don't want to start talking about the combat scenes. After watching few of them I decided to go to the kitchen and make myself a cup of coffee. On the second shelf in my refrigerator I found few donuts. It made me very exited and what could be better than a big jelly donut with a huge cup of coffee in the early afternoon?!

Very well made but very fake, war glorifying and boring film which could be used as excellent example how Hollywood being used to promote the war.

Bruce Willis plays this squad leader for some indescript arm of the US military (is he a Navy Seal, special ops...?? who knows?!).  Bruce is a tough guy who is grappling with his own morality.  He manages to rescue the pretty girl with the big rack, but somehow magically grows a soul after leaving most of the people of her village in a field to be massacred by evil muslim rebels.  (of course, all bad guys are muslim, according to these mindless movies).  At any rate, he grows a soul then decides that he has to help them which involves a mean game of cat and mouse through the jungle with the innocent villagers/bruce/his guys/hot girl with the rack, and the predictably evil muslim rebels who make the occasional stop to rape and pillage along the way.  The movie, of course, comes to an anticlimatic predictable conclusion involving a major gunfight, f-16s and the Cameroonian border.
Frankly, this movie is one big stereotype of conflicts in Africa, not to mention of the tough guy who realizes that he has a soft heart (for the right girl, with the appropriately large rack).

And this is the very first stone laid in the building of the story and because it is never answered, the entire effort fails to reach the heights that it should have.

1880677,4,B000096IBT,"The realities of war have been rarely depicted as they have within the past few years of cinema. Tears of the Sun is another movie (such as Blackhawk Down and Saving Private Ryan) that reveals the cold truth and brutality involved in armed conflict. Granted that the movie is two hours long, we miss much of the monotony of what happens on the march or in between rest areas, but we are not spared the gross truth of mutilation and death. Where this movie lacks in character development, it makes up in heart and realism. When trying to understand what is going on here, try to look past relating to the characters and look towards trying to understand the situation that they're in - people are still dying in the continent of Africa due to ethnic cleansing, civil war, and all out racism. At times, the visions granted to the viewing audience are enough to make you grimace and look away, but we (who have not been involved in such conflict) may only imagine the intensity and dire circumstance of conflict.
The extra features found here are wonderfully crafted to give us a better picture of just how real the situations in this movie are. ""Voices of Africa,"" features testimonies from individuals hearkening from the Congo, the Sudan, Sierra Leone as well as others. Their testimonies remind us that the depictions of violence and war in this movie are not just fantasized, but that many are enduring much worse than what we are able to see. There is also an interactive map, which opens up the door to understanding some of the history of Nigeria as well as ten of her cities. The producers of this DVD have gone far beyond the normative in providing us a better context and understanding to what is happening in all of Africa and why it may be happening particularly in Nigeria.
If for nothing else, purchase this DVD for the extras, but I do not believe that you will be disappointed in the movie itself. You see the mindset of soldiers change from seeing people as ""packages"" and as real, desperate souls who are without hope or comfort in a place such as Nigeria. We are given a glimpse of a reality that is very foreign to many of the two-hundred and ninety million of us who live in relative ease compared to much of the rest of the world.",1060646400,2,2250,4.530712530712531

 wondering if some of this movie could be based on fact?
I'm sure that lots of MISSIONS are carried out by US Soldiers

The horrible treatment during the ethnic cleansing in Nigeria
was just that HORRIFIC!!! It seems inconscionable to me that ANY
human being could treat another the way these poor people were treated.  I DO KNOW, though, that these things DO happen EVERYDAY

I admit that my attitude towards this movie when i first saw the preview was ""seen one seen them all"". I cannot tell you how wrong I was. The great thing about this movie is that not only does it have some great action sequences, but it also has an outstanding plot. Their mission is to rescue a doctor from the rebel forces who are about to attack her village. At first these stoic soldiers do not care about any of the villagers with the exception of the doctor who they have to rescue. As the soldiers witness the terrible things the rebels are capable of and how vunerable and terrified these people are, they quickly reverse their view on the entire situation and they see people as people instead of packages requied in order to complete a mission. As i said before, this movie is so much more than the typical war movie. It shows Africa at its most brutal.

1880680,3,B000096IBT,"Tears of the Sun is a good movie because it tells an effective story.  The plight of refugees in Africa suffering through tribal warfare is the star of the movie.
The main characters, played by Bruce Willis as the military man leading a squadron to save a missionary doctor, played by Monical Belluci, add nothing to the movie.  Belucci's character gets one line to explain her background and we learn nothing about Bruce Willis' character except that he is a soldier.
What makes this movie good is the shock of seeing the suffering that the people in Nigeria can inflict on each other.  Sure, we here about this stuff in America, but it isn't publicized like maybe it should be.  The scene where the American soldiers liberate a village being plundered seems out of place in this action movie, but it is actually the heart of the movie.
I applaud this movie for tackling a true problem realistically, but I don't think I've ever seen a movie where so little attention was paid to character development.",1059350400,3,1003,4.681818181818182
1880681,4,B000096IBT,"A Film by Antoine Fuqua
This is a different kind of war movie and was very different from my expectations.  I had seen the previews for this movie and all I saw were the action scenes and the bombs exploding and I had thought this would be a heavily actioned movie, and thus one that I might not want to see.  I decided to rent it anyway, and it was far different than what I expected.  If you think of it as a military drama out in the field, you will have a more reasonable expectation of what Tears of the Sun is (though no better idea of what the title might mean).
Lt Waters (Bruce Willis) is given the mission to go into Nigeria and extract an American (by marriage) doctor named Lena Kendricks (Monica Bellucci).  Waters and his men are told that the situation in the country is turning extremely dangerous for any foreigner (as well as most natives) because of rebel forces taking control of the country.  Bellucci is less than cooperative and demands that all of the patients and people at the mission also be rescued before she'll leave.  Waters accepts (though we know he is lying) and thus begins the trek to the extraction point.  When they finally make it to the helicopter Kendricks finally realizes that she has been tricked and that all who followed her will be left behind.  She is angry and saddened.  As they fly away they pass over the mission, which is now in flames with the missionaries slaughtered.
Since we are not very far into the movie, we can guess what happens next.  Waters disobeys his orders and goes back to rescue everyone who followed Kendricks.  This begins the real meat of the film as they now have to make it across Nigeria and into Uganda to be able to make it to the next extraction point as the helicopters can only take so many and Waters' superior officer cannot authorize more choppers.  As I mentioned earlier, this is more drama, and from this point on the tension heightens.  Because of the technology the military possesses, they know that they are being tracked by a platoon or more of rebel soldiers and that it is almost a race against time to make it out alive (and with all the refugees).
The film only becomes a typical action movie near the end (all those explosions and the fighting comes in the last third of the movie), and I was pleasantly surprised by this film.  While it will suffer in comparison to Black Hawk Down, as a movie Tears of the Sun is a whole lot better than I had expected.  Antione Fuqua is turning out to be a talented new director and one to watch.  While the story is a bit simplistic and contrived, Fuqua does a great job presenting this film and I look forward to his next movie (and the one after that).",1059091200,3,2689,4.402020202020202
1880682,5,B000096IBT,"I rented this movie because I wanted to see Monica Bellucci, who finally seems to be a rising star over here in North America and ended up enjoying the whole thing. I normally do not like war/gun movies but I was surprised at how much I ended up loving this film.
This movie involves a team of Navy Seals who are ordered to extract a doctor, a priest and two nuns from an African country undergoing a civil war. However things hit a snag when the doctor refuses to leave the Africans who she is treating.
Bruce Willis was surprisingly good, he played a military commander with stoic resolve, but who had a heart.  He and his men could obviously have left the people stranded, or not have gotten involved (which was consistent with their orders).  But they stepped in and did the right thing.  Monica is a bombshell, but she wasn't ridiculously or inappropriately dolled up in a manner that would be inconsistent with the movie. I was surprised that throughout the entire movie she wore a button up shirt and there were no salacious shots of her cleavage. I was also surprised that the Navy SEAL unit had two Black members. One of which was played excellently by Eamon Walker. And neither of them died!
While I feel that the movie was a bit manipulative at times playing on  the  heart strings of the audience. I will admit that it was a vast improvement over the ""shoot em up"" antics that occurred in Black Hawk Dawn (which felt like a giant video game) and which bored me to tears.  Those who are looking for the same mindless madness and mayhem found in Black Hawk Down or the Matrix, might want to give this film a wide berth. Tears of the Sun differs from those movies in that the characters actually have depth.
At times tears came to my eyes as I was reminded of how The West totally ignored and stood by while countless of  Rawandans were slaughtered in the name of ethnic cleansing. While they willingly interfered when the same thing was happening in Bosnia. I guess that African (Black) lives mean nothing where the UN is concerned.
I was glad to see that someone was willing to do the right thing where Africa was concerned.

The mission (rescuing a doctor who does not want to be rescued) is absolutely ridiculous, especially after sitting through the whole thing to find out why she was so important, and still never finding out.  The ground tactics were embarrassing....mistakes that even the greenest of Basic Training graduates would never make.  Who in their right mind would think it was a good idea to stand upright and walk right into 300 enemy soldiers who are firing on you?  No wonder they got chewed up so badly.  The only redeeming value of this movie is that it MIGHT open the eyes of SOME people to the atrocities that are going on in Africa even as we speak.",1058486400,2,703,4.592
1880685,3,B000096IBT,"Hollywood has perfected the art of taking an intriguingly relevant theme (tribal warfare in Nigeria, and btw, the story is acknowledged fiction), then shamelessly commercializing it with a fluffy flag-waving patriotic flavour and taking what could have been a fabulous movie steadily downhill.
Nigeria's government is overthrown by an exiled general and some Navy Seals have to save a female American doctor from evil Nigerian rebels who like to behead priests for recreation. Of course our American doctor (a lady) is an immacutaley shaped and brushed Italian supermodel, Monica Belluci, and please don't be surprised if an educated and qualified professional posted in a forest can be as much of a twit as she is (""Stop running! I hurt my nail!"").
Along the way, we find that the Nigerians are after some tribal leader and the movie ends with a Rambo-like military coupe. The U.S. Navy sends in two jets to napalm the Nigerian Army at the very end of the movie, so it leaves you wondering what the character of Willis really accomplished on his own except for getting a lot of people killed and ""saving"" a shamefully tiny percentage of the villagers.
I guess ""Tears of the Sun"" intended to tote some kind of anti-war sentiment but I just got an anti-smug-missionary message from the movie. And, that old geezers should probably not be leading any missions if they are Lieutenants after 30 years in the Officer Corps (as brilliantly potrayed by a clearly weary Bruce Willis, wonder what he was so bored with, the war or the script).
An interesting theme tossed away with the lack of character development -- no background about the doctor, the Seals, or the Nigerian refugees and rebels -- and a sugar-puff love story thrown in between the doctor and Bruce Willis.
In my book, this may be marginally more palatable than Black Hawk Down, a lot less darker for sure and not exactly a re-enactment of actual facts as the latter was. It may even be an OK fare to sit through on night-time television, or even a rental if you are out of other options, but I would not really stand in line for purchasing a DVD.",1058486400,2,2106,4.741144414168938

There is the 'Making of Tears of the Sun'- a great 10 minute piece on how the director made the movie, with behind the scence shots and everything.  I thought it was interesting that the actors had to go though a mini-2-week SEAL boot camp.
Also in the Extras ae the delted scenes.  I originally selected play all, but after 20 minutes I stopped...there are about 10-15 deleted scenes!
In addition to the deleted scenes, they have ""the Voices of Africa"", where real africans tell their story about their life and how they got where they are.  It's a real shame that most of them have seen what the moviegoer saw in the movie in real life, an ""ethni cleansing"" of city.  They have actually seen mass murder in front of them.

Bruce Willis plays a battle hardened and very experienced leader of a small band of Navy Seals, sent into Nigeria at a time of severe unrest and civil war to rescue an American Doctor. Pricked by the graphic images he witnesses and an inner conscious that supercedes his lifelong ability to follow ""orders"" he takes matters upon himself to rescue not only the good doctor, but as many of her refugee patients as he can.
This is much more than an ""escape"" movie, as we see the elite team battle the elements and an ever nearing army of troops hot on their tracks throughout the movie, to it's bloody conclusion. The film never falls into any cliches along the way, there are no unlikely romantic nuances, and the acting is strong and extremely well guided. It also very cleverly never gives up the plot, or ending despite what we may believe throughout the movie, as the viewer will watch attentively and see, being drawn into the picture. Brutal in it's depiction of a war torn and divided country, and graphic in it's images of ethnic cleansing, this movie is not for the squeamish, but it is more than just compelling. Willis is superb, without any of the unbelievability of the Die Hard movies, to which this has been compared, and the outcome is gripping, and uplifting.

Bruce Willis is cast as the lieutenant in charge of the mission.  Monica Bellucci is cast as the doctor.  Naturally there is chemistry between them.  And naturally she hates him at the beginning because he refuses to help the 70 people from her infirmary.  He lies to her and kidnaps her but then has a change of heart.  And he and his fellow Seals risk their lives to rescue everybody.  There were bad guys and good guys in this film and it was easy to recognize who they were and root for the good guys as they made their way through a hostile jungle.  Everyone was made up with just the right amount of mud and grime to make their faces shine and the camerawork and lighting were perfect.  And, of course, Monica Bellucci's neckline was always arranged to show off her charms to their best advantage.  There were also vivid scenes of hideous wounds and awful atrocities. And even though I know these particular scenes were staged, I shudder at the thought that scenes like these are real to many people.
Later the ""extra"" on the DVD explained it was all  filmed in Hawaii, with Africans who had actually lived through horrors being flown in as extras to work in the film.

1880692,5,B000096IBT,"The obvious point of this film is that it concerns sub-Saharan Africa's return to tribal warfare with the exodus the European colonial powers.  A point for the most part wasted on European and American viewers as born out by many of the 111 reviews already posted.
What this film neglects to make clear enough for either pickup truck driving Joe Six-pack or the Volvo driving suburban Liberal is the underlying cause of the problems plaguing Nigeria are the same as Chad, Sudan and Somalia. It is that primitive Islam does not tolerate Christianity or any other religion.  The victims in this film are Ibo.  The Ibo have always been peaceful and they are Christian.  The Hausa  are warrior and they are Muslim. The Hausa Muslim ruled northern Nigeria into the 20th century when the British subdued them.
The plot was a bit of stretch, but as a veteran, I found it credible.  The Navy Seals are an elite in every sense of the word.  As such, their field commanders are given a bit more latitude then ordinary line officers.  Actually, the Navy has a tradition that, given the right circumstances, a ship's captain can countermand even a Presidential order. That dates back to the days when communication was slow.  But the principle still lives on.
The character development was superb.  Willis is man caught between orders and his conscience.  He has seen what happens when the blood thirsty Hausa overrun a defenseless population ""of another faith"" - the tactful reference repeated used in the film.  He goes back and leads some villagers to safety.",1057363200,2,1550,4.829545454545454

The Enemy
Ryan: a cruel, brutal regime bent on ethnic purification (Nazi Germany)
Tears: a cruel, brutal regime bent on ethnic purification...P>The Team
Ryan: a squad of Rangers who have already done North Africa, Italy and Omaha Beach.  Not bad. Though not as fine honed as today's special forces, Rangers were kind of elite in WW2.
Tears: Navy SEALS, nuff said.  They don't even bother to say their real names, just nicknames will do.
The FUBAR Mission
Ryan: bring home the last son of a mother who has already lost three others to the war, basically a public relations job
Tears: bring home a doctor who is an American citizen only by marriage, while at that, carry along two nuns and a priest, all non-Americans, basically, a public relations job
The Irony
Ryan: The philosophical question, posed by Reiben: ""Where's the sense in risking the lives of the eight of us for just one guy?""
Tears: Shallower than that.  She's not even really American, and her American husband is long dead.
The boss with mustache and gruff personality
Ryan: Dennis Farina
Tears: Tom Skeritt
The pain in the [reat] squad member
Ryan: Pvt. Reiben (acted naturally by Edward Burns)
Tears: Red (although he does not incite a mutiny, and, well, see below.)
The ice-in-his veins, sure-as-the-Grim-Reaper killer...
Ryan: Pvt. Jackson, the sniper
Tears: since these are Navy SEALS, I have to say all of them, but especially Red, who does expertly the whole gamut of weapons (explosives, SOCOM pistol, knife, M4/M16 carbine, M60 machinegun)
The dramatic turning point (a.k.a. the excuse for the gratuitous display of combat, tactics, weapons, mayhem, etc. on screen)
Ryan: Capt. John Miller allows Pvt. Ryan to talk him into defending a bridge, which leads to the disastrous battle with German armor and infantry
Tears: LT (Bruce Willis) allows his conscience, with a little help from Dr. Kendricks, to talk him into turning back to save the poor refugees, which leads to the battle with what appeared to be thousands of murderous Nigerians over jungle and tall grass
The bail out element (the one that saves the day)
Ryan: P-51 Mustangs, ""tank busters"", or as Matt Damon says, ""like angels over our shoulders""
Tears: F/A-18 Hornets which drop cluster bombs on the Nigerians
THE BIG DIFFERENCE
Ryan: of the original rescue team, only two survive, the coward (Cpl. Upham, the translator) and the one who didn't give a d@mn(Pvt. Reiben).  Tom Hanks (Cpt. Miller) was the last to die.
Tears: Half of them actually survive, and the doctor, and even Bruce Willis lives!

This is what I'd expect...because they're on their own in the middle of hostile, unfamiliar country.  A mutiny would have been totally bad form, one that would only lead to disaster.
I hope I have not slighted this movie by comparing it with another.  I think it is well done, especially for this genre...The acting is just right.  As always, Monica Bellucci gives the understated performance we've come to identify her with (""Malena"").

1880695,5,B000096IBT,"From the opening sequences aboard the aircraft carrier to the closing credits desplayed over escaping helicopters, this is perhaps the single most thoughtful action film of recent memory. Bruce Willis is terrific as an officer whose special operations team is assigned to extract an American national missionary doctor (a lovely woman, of course) from the war-ravaged rural areas of Nigeria. What should be a quick and easy operation turns complex based on the doctor's seemingly outrageous demand that seventy Nigerians be brought along, on the one hand, and Willis' sorely vexed conscience based on what he knows will happen to these Nigerians if he leaves them behind.  So, Eighty or so strong, they venture tenuously into the hidden dangers of the jungle, quickly pursued by a battalion of rebel forces bent on finding and killing them.
What then transpires is both well dramatized and cinematically executed, and the movie gives the viewer a quite accurate idea of the amazing firepower contained in a relatively small American fighting unit, and at the same time it also renders a glowing and accurte portrait of just how selfless and caring American fighting men can be. In the wake of so many such recent examples in Iraq, it is touching to see it so convincingly dramatized here. Yet at the same time, some troubling social and political questions regarding the nature of the human beings that inhabit the planet are depicted in quite gritty detail, and the subsequent theme of how to make sense in an absolutely insane situation plays a major role in making this an excellent, albeit a bit self-conscious and serious, action film.
The action is superb, the cinematography of the African landscape is breath taking, and the actors provide a wonderful ensemble portrait of people trying to cope with the manifest craziness of conflict and war. One leaves the film thinking about what has been said and shown, and with a greater appreciation for just how marvelously complex our position in the world is. I highly recommend the film both for entertainment and for edification. Enjoy",1057104000,18,2089,5.03757225433526
1880696,2,B000096IBT,"I had looked forward to this film, so it says a lot of my disappointment that I'm writing this particular review.
What had the potential to be a really great film, falls sorrowfully from the target.  The story starts out strong enough, throwing light on an area of conflict in the world worth attention, but annoyingly, there are just too many moments that make an intelligent viewer go ""Ah, come on.""  In the end, it felt like it was going a little too 'Hollywood.'  Some flaws are in the story, some in the film making.
I have to vent some examples, so if you don't want me to spoil the film for you, STOP reading now.  SPOILERS FOLLOW.
While the performances by the actors are strong enough, the characters themselves are a little less compelling.  The initial premise sends a group of US soldiers in to Africa to extract foreigners before military forces come through to certainly slaugher them all.  Monica Belluci's doctor character should have been at least a little prepared for the brutality, considering her time already spent in the region, and the injured she cares for, and yet throughout the whole film she seems oblivious to danger, and more of an antogonist to the story than the 'bad guys.'
Secondly, perhaps the biggest grip, is the final battle.  There's already a scene that establishes the good guys' skills as Special Ops soldiers, using stealth and tactics to overpower enemies quickly and efficiently, and yet they choose to fight the final battle by advacing side-by-side down the middle of a clearing in the jungle.  No wonder they start to get shot up. Duh.  Then, after enough bloodshed, we find that the destination to the journey is close enough to run to.  Why didn't they just run for it 10 minutes sooner?
And then there's the 'surprise' reveleation towards the end of Act 2.  Uh, Monica's character is a doctor, so she shouldn't be stupid.  So she could have saved all of her people from peril back at the first helicopter scene if she just put one guy on the helicopters?  Then why not save them all the trouble?
We kept feeling like they were on the verge of making Bruce and Monica make out in the midst of all this mess, when really, Bruce's character would have been more justified in slapping her.
And lastly, an example of excessive spectacle.  Bruce Willis' character carries on a satelite-phone call to his commander (Tom Skerrit) back on the aircraft carrier.  For the shear spectacle of 'hey, wouldn't this be neat,' they put Tom Skerrit on the deck of the carrier for his half of the shots, so that they can have aircraft landing and taking off right behind him.  It comes off as a stupid scene, as you have great difficulty hearing what Skerrit has to say over the planes, and then there's the fact that Skerrit obviously can't hear anything either.
It's frustrating, when watching an otherwise good film, to suddenly reach all those parts that make you go 'Oh, this is stupid.  Why would they do that?'
""Tears of the Sun"" had the ingrediants (if they fixed a few story problems), not just to be a great war film, in the league of ""Black Hawk Down"" or ""Platoon,"" but a truly great film, period.  It's frustrating to see it miss so horribly.",1056412800,5,3187,4.620567375886525

Even in terms of seeing this movie as just entertainment was difficult trying to accept the totally ridiculous decisions made by the Lieutenant (Bruce Willis).

Having seen the scars of ""ethic cleansing"" in the countryside north of the capital Kampala, having heard the stories from those that crouched for months and months clinging to some vague hope of suvival as entire villages were massacred, have so wonderfully connected with those beautiful people, I was stunned by the plausability of this film.  Nigeria is indeed an explosive country, straddled by deep religious tension (they muslims to the north wanting to impose Islamic Law on the Christrians throughout), and like most African countries, a ever simmering-ready-to-blow keg of ethnic hatred.  Americans (sometimes) learn of the attrocities which have become all too common in Africa.  But like the holocaust, we hesitate to believe that such evil does exist and will set forth its will in utter destruction and contempt of life.

I deeply appreciated this flick because it seemed to bring the horrors of what we do not want to believe or see into our homes.  These realities cannot be trivialized.  They are real, as is the premise: ""evil will triump when good men do nothing"".  This movie was one of the most powerfully compelling, deeply emotional films I have seem.

And, having seen the film with a French citizen, before the war, I came out (of coarse) blasting the French (though they are now in the congo for a time) for their all too selfish crusade against intervention in Iraq - which amounted to little more than a desparate attempt to form a counter weight to American power on the geo-political stage, all while the mass graves continue to grow in population, while the children of Iraq continued to die under the suffocating embargo to the tune of 700,000 over 10+/- years.

Not that these men were good in essense, the world has a VERY short supply of truely GOOD men (human).  But this film does pose some difficult questions in a very compelling way, one that I hope will be a catalyse for the lazily blinding and hedonistic and anything but GOOD American people as we examine our responsibility in the world as its only remaining superpower.",1056326400,8,2162,4.8478260869565215

Maybe not for a 10 click hike, but the second that a target resists extration, she would be bound, gagged, and on a soldier's shoulder.  The point is, the beginning of this movie - the conflict it is based around - simply would not happen.
Other than that, it's a halfway realistic representation of war, certainly more realistic in scope than Black Hawk Down, which displayed a pretty good portrait of special ops combat in itself (without all the political factors surrounding combat).

This movie is rather slow paced with lots of ""emotion"" tossed in. It takes an otherwise entertaining action flick downhill, in my opinion.
Things aren't all bad though. There's some great action mixed in between all the sappy parts, and nearly all the the actors playing the US soldiers give a great performance. The ironic thing is, most of the characters seem just as annoyed at the slow pace and sappy nature of it all as I did, which made it that much more tolerable.

The main plot of the trackers to sever the blood line of sole remaining heir to the kingdom can at just the right time.

1880706,4,B000096IBT,"I purchased this film having not ever seen it. I got it based on friends' recommendations, so I knew I'd probably like it. The storyline was pretty solid given the current situation in several African countries. An African country is in the middle of a coup, and rebels are killing people all over the country.
Willis plays the commander of a SEAL team sent in to extract an American citizen working at a mission hospital. She demands that they take a bunch of other people with them or she's not going. A massive rebel force tracks them through the jungle trying to kill them all.
The firefight scenes are pretty good, and elaborate a bit on the tactics of swift, silent attacks done by the SEALs.
One scene I thought was pretty hilarious (stupid) was a scene where Tom Skerrit is on the flight deck of an aircraft carrier talking to Willis on a satellite phone. Skerrit has one finger in his other ear while talking to Willis. I found this funny because I know that the noise level on the flight deck of a carrier is so high that if you stand there without hearing protection, in about 1 minute you'd be dead. Just an observation, that's all.
Overall the movie was good, but not excellent, so I didn't give it 5 stars. Several small things like the scene mentioned previously knocked it down a notch. Don't get me wrong, this is a good movie, and I'm definitely glad I got it. As with many war movies, the content isn't suitable for younger children, say 14 and under, even with parental supervision. Some scenes are too intense for them.",1056067200,,1540,4.503571428571429
1880707,4,B000096IBT,"Great story, acting and cinematography.  Finally a decent story that involves you in the turmoil of West Africa and American forces doing the right thing.  The thing I liked best about this movie is that nothing is over done.  The director Antoine Fuqua does not show a heavy hand leading to a well balanced and consistent tempo for the movie.
The story of a US Navy SEAL team securing refugees in Nigeria is compelling.  This fiction gives a glimpse of US forces doing what they do best that is going into harms way for a higher good.
This movie is a winner for the actors Bruce Willis and Monica Belluci.  I don't expect to see Academy Awards for acting out of this but it should get nomination(s).  Moreover the co-stars and entire supporting cast complement the stars and the story.
Cinematography is sublime.  You almost feel the dense imposing jungle and all of it's nuance from creatures, to the challenging terrain, sauna-like quality, and pounding downpour.  Color and lighting are great.  Sound could have used some help.

Watching this film made me even more grateful to be an American and live in this country. I couldn't even imagine living through what the people in this film had to endure.
The film centers around a group of men in the military who go on a mission to rescue a doctor, two nuns, and a priest from a mission in Nigeria. This group is led by Bruce Willis' character, Lt. Waters. When they arrive, the doctor is hesitant to leave and insists and taking 70 of her patients with her. The two nuns and priest decide to stay at the mission with the remaining patients even though their decision would ultimately result in their deaths. Against his orders, Lt. Waters takes the doctor and her 70 patients through the jungles of Nigeria to safety while being hunted.
I really enjoyed this film because it shows that making the right decision, even if you're going against orders or what is expected of you, can be so much rewarding than just doing what you're told. I will agree with other reviewers that there are some graphic scenes in this film, so if you're a little sensitive to that, you may want to divert your eyes for a moment.
I would highly suggest this film to anyone regardless of your like or dislike of war films. ""Tears of the Sun"" will pull you in and captivate you from the beginning!",1055808000,2,1470,4.408088235294118

The Good:
 I really couldn't find anything.
The Bad:
 Absolutley no chain of command whatsoever...anywhere.
 One fire mission manages to kill every single hostile in the area while not harming our heroes.
 The final encounter is no more than a quick jog from the safety of an allied compound apparently.
The Ugly:
 These happen to be the dumbest navy seals I have ever heard of, led by a man who is probably the dumbest in the bunch.  He makes a bad decision from the outset and then complicates it with more bad decisions.  Who was the technical advisor on this film, or did they even bother with one? Lines such as ""conserve your ammo!"" were followed by men firing from the hip indescriminatly into the treeline, while ""hold the line!"" was usually followed by a retreat.  The ambush they intended to orchestrate put the Seals in the lowest possible firing position, firing up into the enemy.  No one bothered with camoflauge (especially Willis' big shiny bald head), and the teams sniper honestly would have known better.  They wait until they are engaged to place their claymore, but luckily the enemy in typical hollywood fashion can't hit a thing.  And when things start going poorly they honestly line up in a row and start walking across the clearing towards the enemy.  Come on, honestly.  Didn't we learn to stop fighting like that about the time of WW1? Another great portrayal of one of the best fighting forces in the world (heavy sarcasm).",1055721600,17,1609,4.639575971731449

Now I have never been to Nigeria so I shouldn't specaulate on things I haven't seen first hand but I can say I have never seen teeth as good as there is a national geographic.

Naturally, she convinces Willis to also rescue her 70 Nigerian villagers.  This movie is long on philosophical jungle conversations but short on emotional impact, until the last thirty minutes or so when violence substitutes for intelligence.
It is truly jingoistic and could well have been named Die Hard four, or five, or six.........Good news for fans of the genre!
To its credit, the scenics are remarkable, as is the reality of ethnic cleansing in war-torn Nigeria.  In conclusion, if you have nothing better to do on a Sunday afternoon, rent it.  Just know this is no Hamburger Hill, or Black Hawk down!",1055721600,,874,4.918367346938775
1880713,2,B000096IBT,"I really enjoy good action movies.  I tend to like war movies.  Somehow, this was not one of them.
Bruce Willis was fine and believable as a Navy SEAL.  Monica Belucci - a super-hot Italian bombshell playing a super-sentimental doctor - is just fine and probably the best part of the movie.  That's it, those are all (read: both) of the characters.
The direction is fine - at least its not jerky or super-faux-artsy e.g. Thin Red Line.  The problem is that the movie contributes nothing to the war or action film genre.  It is not new or different from any movie that you have seen before.  There is nothing really good to say about anything.  The story was okay and somewhat touching, bleeding-heart American soldiers who mostly die (sorry if I ruined it) save a bunch of Nigerians including someone special (won't ruin it) on an extraction mission meant to just save Monica, which is what I would be doing.
The action scenes aren't bad but are mainly just long shootouts that you've seen 10, 20, 30 times before.  At times you may forget whether your are at the middle or end of the movie, it is all essentially the same.  Spoken lines are few.  Real tension is missing completely.  Cool, realistic-looking combat scenes, though - and lots of blood.
Suprisingly enough the movie is pretty long.  It is unfortunate that there are still only two essentially undeveloped characters and a very linear, static storyline.  The ending is predictable - you don't find out what happens afterwards, and you don't care.  This film wants to be Black Hawk Down, but isn't.  Don't waste your time, unless you are a huge war movie nut.  Then you will probably want to watch this, and say all the things I said to your war-nut-buddies, and then go watch Patton again to remind you that some war movies are genuinely pretty good.

1880715,3,B000096IBT,"We've all seen this movie before. It's been done in different styles and with different talents, but the underlying roots are recycled and not-so-original. But if you can push that away, ""Tears of the Sun"" comes off as an overall decent film that manages to entertain one way or another.
Bruce Willis plays a Navy S.E.A.L. Lieutenant who leads a band of men into war-torn Africa to extract an American doctor (Monica Bellucci) and a nun and a priest. When they arrive at the doctor's ""mission,"" she refuses to leave her people behind. Willis disobeys direct orders from the big man on the carrier (Tom Selleck), and tells her she can bring them along to the extraction point. When they arrive, she realizes he lied to her. Feeling sorry for the Africans, Willis allows her to bring 12 people along. Skip forward a few chapters on your DVD player, and you'll see that they are being tracked by African soldiers on a rampage. If they don't make it out by a few days, they'll all be dead.
Monica Bellucci's Dr. Kendrix is a whiny, arrogant person. Willis' character saves her life and disobeys direct orders many times. Just for her. But she still whines. One thing that got me was when Willis tells her they must keep moving because of enemy troops hot on their trail, but she says ""We've been walking for thirty hours! We need rest!"" Well, excuuuuuse me, but the stinkin' people wouldn't even BE THERE if it wasn't for Willis disobeying direct orders. Something's better than nothing, lady. But oh well, it's just a movie.
Bruce Willis gives a fairly good lead in the film, but I can't help but feel that he seems tired. Maybe it's a sign of a great actor enveloping his weathered old S.E.A.L. LT. Or maybe it's just a tired-out actor. Time will tell. I suppose he'll be sleeping by the time ""Die Hard 4: Die Hardest"" starts filming.
Monica Bellucci is a good choice for this film, mainly because she doesn't seem like someone who wouldn't be in Africa. I can't imagine what it would look like if, say, Willis had to rescue some beauty queen. ""Stop running--I broke a nail!"" Unlike films where the leading lady is running through stormy locations and still comes out with her hair-doo intact, Bellucci's hair becomes greasy and sweaty and her clothes get dirty. It's a bit more realistic than a film like this usually tries to be. Kudos there.
But in the long run, ""Tears of the Sun"" is nothing extraordinarily special. It's good, and entertaining, but wait till video to see it. It's not worth flying out to the theater for. Although, as I write this, the film is already out on VHS and DVD. I guess I just got a late screening on this one.",1055635200,,2640,4.56

C'mon even though Waters is a highly-trained seal who has never failed a mission, does that mean that he'll never question an order? That he'll never defy his superior officers? Whether he's a SEAL or GI Joe, he's still human. People think that a soldier only follows orders and does as he's told, but there's more to it than that. As a soldier, especially as an officer, your job is to make decisions. There may come a time when you do have to go against the mission, orders or whatever. I believe Waters did the right thing in this situation. So why did he turn the choppers around? I think he realized that his greater mission is to serve humanity.

After viewing a village that has had an ethnic cleansing is it any wonder? I wish they had given more of a role to some of the African villagers. Their part of mostly defenseless natives is unrealistic. Somewhat graphicly this movie demonstrates plenty of action and drama. When a group of Navy Seals are told to go in and pull out an American teacher, a couple nuns, and a priest, it looks like a straight forward extraction. When it is obvious the American (by marriage, now widowed) won't leave without those in her care the mission becomes far from simple. You can tell the firefights were made by the people that brought you Blackhawk Down. Very well staged. I have been to Oahu, HI and seen the sets where much of the filming took place.

1880721,5,B000096IBT,"I was deeply moved by this movie.  Here in NYC its 10 dollars to see a movie and I saw this twice and bought the soundtrack----a [big]investment.  I do like Bruce Willis as an actor and Monica Belluci who I first saw in Under Suspicion, here and now in the Matrix Unloaded is a total knockout, not just because she's pretty but because you can see her thinking.  Much the way Catherine Zeta-Jones acts in flms----you can see even if this person is pretending they are thinking about this scene as if it is relaity and their characters are infused with the hesitation, the deliberation of intelligent people who don't blurt al they know or suspect.
Willis as always is yet another shade, another degree, another facet of an accomplished actor who is striving for a versatility that is ingratiating.
The film was incredible because it so accurately dealt with the murky complexity of war.  Suddenly on a simple mission to snatch 4 missionaries out of a hospital village that is in the line of the now killer spree military, Willis' small force finds themselves with loads of moral dilemmas.  Belluci won't go without her patients, three of the missionaries refuse to go at all so strong is their commitment to the African people they tend.  To get them moving Willis lies to Belluci and then can't live with the lie when they leave behind dozens of helpless people.  What drove me in this film is what would I do, what is teh military's responsibility, what is a human being's responsibility to another?  Do we just abandon each other on ""orders"" or political ties that may not even touch us personally or is every life valuable.
When this film came out, the Iraq attack was on and people were literally screaming in the streets about kill, kill, kill.
War is an abomination.  It is literally the raping of the human race as an action to take against another.  And yet we not only do it but produce it as entertainment.  What made thsi film stand out, I generally don't go to war films nor gangster films, is that the very message of this film is about the people who are caught inbetween all of this drama.  People who are just drinking a glass of water, raising their families, tending their fields.
The film also demands a conclusive answer to a central question, a presupposition of war----you must be able to kill women and children.  Put a gun to their heads or allow them to die.  And there comes a point when the soldiers can not do this, nor watch it be done.  That's what makes thsi film stand out and why I heartily reccommend it to people who don't get off on war, on gore, on watching the pantomime of people dying.
I cried during the movie because I knew that a few thousand miles to the East people, just normal folk, were being slaughtered much as the people in the film were, simply for being caught between two armies/ideologies.
Aksua Busia plays one of the rescued villagers, she was Celie's sister in the Color Purple and did a heavy re-write on Beloved the screenplay.  She is a commendable actress though her part here has to embody such positive African sentiment that it does seem maudlin, or too ""cloying"" of gratitude. She is an excellent actress and the best twist of all is how Belluci's character makes it infaticly clear, without regards to race, that these are HER people and she will not be safe if they aren't safe.
And it soon becomes apparent during the film that she will even lie to the American soldiers to protect her adopted people.  That form of not simply heroism but diverging from the norm stance----a character willing to die, to put it all on the line without even having a weapon for the racial ""other"" is wondorous thing to see.
I also recommend the soundtrack which is moving and haunting and foreboding and as lush as the jungle these people move through. I enjoyed Fuqua's direction, particularly the African military being portrayed as a force so intent, so massive that literally the only thing that saves anyone from them is a deux ex machina.
The title Tears of the Sun literally refers to the final ten minutes of the movie when the whole world has gone to hell and a battle breaks out that can't be won.
I also like a good chase film, where someone is being chased and must compensate for the fact that they are outnumbered or outgunned.

The film could have been a half an hour if it stuck to the mission, which was to extract three missionaries, led by the beautiful Monica Bellucci, remember here in Under Suspicion, wow. Anyway, the forces led by the incomproable Bruce Willis is almost home free, except she will not leave without 70 of her people who will die at the hands of a brutal regime if they stay,  and in a moment of decision, defies his orders and turns around, loading 12 of the oldest and handicapped and children and walk to Cameroon, what follows is survival, soul searching, and the horrors of war and violence on oppressed people.  The film is well acted, especially Willis, a combat hardened vet who follows his heart rather than his mission, and is determined to take them like Moses leading the children of Israel to the promised land.

1880725,4,B000096IBT,"Much too often Hollywood creates action films for no other reason than to kill people and have lots of explosions (think ""XXX,"" and every Van Damme movie ever made). But once in a great while, an action film is produced that actually has some emotional baggage to it. ""Tears Of The Sun"" is a wonderfully produced film about the plight of tribal warfare in Africa, in this case specifically Nigeria. A lot of people have said 'if you liked ""Black Hawk Down,"" you'll love this movie;' when that statement couldn't be farther from the truth. ""B.H.D."" was about a mission that had gone wrong and the struggle of our heroic fighting men who fought for their lives; whereas ""T.O.T.S."" was about a small band of Navy SEALs who stray from their mission and try to do teh right thing. The film actually seems to be more of a mixture of ""The Wild Geese"" and ""Three Kings."" Director Antoine Fuqua, fresh off the magnificent ""Training Day,"" injects the script with emotion and turns it from a standard action fare into a action film with heart and a message. You can formulate any number of messages that you want from the film - and I won't politicize my views here - but the one that seems to stand out the most is: EVERYONE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THIS WORLD. By doing the little things, such as leading a group of refugees to safe haven, one can stop all of the evil and hate in the world. The film brilliantly combines drama with explosive action sequences and a wonderful performance from Bruce Willis. Critics lambasted him in this film, but he was actually quite realistic - a SEAL who wants nothing but to complete his mission, but along the way he realizes the consequences of his mission. The film is also a stunning reminder of the professionalism and the courage of our men & women serving in the armed forces - especially Navy SEALs, the best of the best! A great film to enjoy again and again, but lets hope that the message of the film is not lost!",1055203200,,1953,4.473389355742297
1880726,5,B000096IBT,"A brilliantly conceived and executed war movie. Bruce Willis is less Die Hard and more real and compassionate, although clearly flawed. He and his platoon of Navy Seals force themselves into facing what they have stood down from many times in the past. It means disobeying orders and putting themselves at greater risk, but they do it, to atone for their past sins. The result is a story of gruesome intensity mingled with empathy and spiritual and physical redemption. I highly recommend it.
Some have doubted that the situations portrayed in this movie could ever actually exist. But ethnic cleansing and other war and brutality is rampant up and down Africa, lest you forget Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Uganda, Angola, Mozambique and Zimbabwe among others. And brutality and religious persecution continue in Nigeria, which was in fact embroiled in a civil war and military dictatorship a few years back and still stuns the world with inexplicable and hideous responses to something like the Miss World contest, which resulted in another massacre.
You might say Tears of the Sun took the cliche of making the setting dense rainforest-like vegetation, but a bit of research reveals that a good portion of Nigeria is in fact dense rainforest-like vegetation.",1052870400,6,1277,5.144230769230769

1880728,4,B000096IBT,"Director Antoine Fuqua never realized how timely his tale would be.  Tears of the Sun is yet another war movie, but it is put together well, plus it delivers a strong message without being preachy.
Bruce Willis takes on a new direction (ok, he doesn't) as Lt. AK Waters, a hardened, war-weary commander sent to rescue an American doctor in the jungles of Nigeria.  His by-the-book approach to his mission becomes tested after witnessing the atrocities committed against the unarmed townspeople and the missionaries with them.  Waters later discovers there is a lot more at stake than simply the mission and his men.
The real scene-stealer is Monica Belluci as Doctor Lena Kendricks.  Taking the new #1 spot on my 'most beautiful' list, I fear she may have been miscast simply for the fact that she's so damn good-looking I couldn't pay attention to the movie.  The photography is spectacular, the action scenes are riveting, and Hans Zimmer's masterful composition enhances the movie perfectly.
A lot of criticism has been leveled at this movie for being jingoistic, probably because the commandos are actually competent.  Others focused on the supposed love interest between Willis and Belluci.  I'm not sure these criticisms are even relevant, but I will say that the make-up work (especially in the finale) borders on halloween funny.  Regardless, if you can look past this and the all too familiar cast, (right down to Tom Skerritt as the ""Captain""), you'll agree that the moral dilemma presented by Fuqua is forcefully and powerfully delivered, even if you don't necessarily agree with the decisions made.",1051056000,27,1610,5.071969696969697

Thus, he returns in order to bring the refugees to the borders of Cameroon, where they can be safe.  Tears of the Sun shows present-day fictional violence in Nigeria that is very similar to the genocide that took place in Rwanda ten years ago where soldiers of one tribe chased another in order to secure their own tribes future.  However, the film comes across as a propaganda film showing why war is a necessary, which hurts the overall experience.  In addition, Dr. Lena Hendricks character does not come across as credible for many reasons such as clothing (i.e., to look sexy instead of practical in the jungle), explicit use of make up, and professional care of eye brows.

In my experience, I have found that most critics don't know squat about good movies and since I enjoy war movies and movies with Bruce Willis, I thought I would enjoy TEARS OF THE SUN. Though the movie has some touching scenes and is highly patriotic (portraying the gallant bravery of America's fighting forces), the film failed to move me. Bruce's character's attraction to the young widowed doctor he saves detracted too much from the plot (what little of it there was). The film is definitely an after-SAVING PRIVATE RYAN film because of the graphic and realistic violence and bloodshed. However, TEARS fails where RYAN succeeded because the film fails let the audience emphasize with its characters. Nevertheless, with its faults, TEARS is still better than many other films currently being shown and produced.

1880731,4,B000096IBT,"This is not your typical shoot-em-up Bruce Willis action movie.  Yes, there is a decent amount of shooting and a bit of blow-em-up at the end, but guns and explosions are not the focus in this movie.  This is a movie about what happens to Americans when they see 'ethnic cleansing' first hand.  It is quite somber throughout and action fans would say 'somewhat boring', but it is definitely worth seeing.
Bruce plays a veteran US Navy SEAL team leader who has just returned from a mission when he and his team are sent back out on an urgent mission into Nigeria to rescue a female American missionary doctor whose facility is soon to be overrun by 'ethnic cleansing'.  Bruce and his team are no nonsense types who just want to get missions done and get on home, but when they start to see the merciless, bloody results of ethnic cleansing, they can't get this out of their minds as they journey into a variation of Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"".  Bruce broods often and appears tormented by the biblical maxim of ""Anyone, then, who knows the good he ought to do and doesn't do it, sins"" as he weighs the simple plan of getting the doctor and getting out with the pleas of the helpless natives.  The choices he then makes unleashes him and his team into a torrent of drawn out human drama.
This is not a happy, smiley movie.  It wasn't intended to be.  It is an innovative way to help viewers to get an idea of what this distant thing Americans read of in the newspapers called ""ethnic cleansing"" really is.  It's primary fault is that it does have a bit of cliches mixed in, but these do not take away from the value of getting 'comfortable' Westerners to understand again that the World out there can be a brutal place.  If you don't see it at the theater, definitely pick it up on video.  It may well provoke some discussions afterwards if you watch it with a group.  Give it a try.",1049932800,3,1883,4.410404624277457

They are the Best of the Best.
I can understand someone who is not real into the military not liking this, but I loved it. Also, people might frown at the fact that a platoon leader would change an actual mission because that would never happen. Other than that, this movie is very realistic. When was the last time you actually saw grenades not hit people in a war movie? Never. I have seen this movie 3 times and it got better every time I saw it.
Critics who graded this movie low need to a grade it on it's genre, a war movie. Do not compare it to Chicago because that is a drama. Grade it on how good of a war movie it is. If someone can not handle life and is afraid of violence, then that could be another reason they graded it low. But that is what it is like in Africa. Get use to it.
I thought the actors in this movie did a great job, especially Bruce Willis and Johnny Messner. They must of had actual Navy SEALs on the spot helping them with what they should do. I would say that this movie and Black Hawk Down are the 2 best up-to-date war movies ever made.

1880734,1,B000096IBT,"Tears of the Sun is another attempt by Hollywood to nurture the notion held by not few Americans that Africa is one huge jungle, where man and beast live in close proximity, and whose people are incapable of conducting the business of government without resorting to wanton massacre. Of course, it's largely a matter of capitalism: Hollywood churns out features that sell, and features that align themselves with romanticized notions happen to sell very well. It's a matter of giving people what they want, what reaffirms their smug convictions, and whatever makes them declare in self-adulation, ""there goes us but for the grace of God.""
In the pathetic feature, an African nation is presented as a massive forest (which, coincidentally, fits snugly into the West's notion of Africa). ""Nigerian"" politics is reduced to a primordial tribal bloodbath perpetuated by the ""Fulanis"" against the ""Ibos.""
Supposedly, the ""Ibo"" President (who, it appears, holds a part time job as a ""tribal king"" of sorts) is murdered by ""Fulani rebels."" His son, who is ""heir"" to ""the throne,"" suddenly becomes the burden of the US Navy SEALS dispatched to extract an American doctor from the ""hostile"" region. The juxtaposition of ""presidency"" and ""tribal kingship"" in one single man is an anachronism, an eccentricity, and an aberration. It is ridiculous, to say the least. Nigerian politics, I am sure, is far more sophisticated than portrayed, and the variant of tribal politics depicted would have been better ascribed to another place and time.
In the end, we are left with the impression that, once again, the Westerner has succeeded in saving the African from himself, as the helicopters rise in messianic ascension into the clouds. Indeed, the very scene was reminiscent of Jesus Christ himself ascending into heaven after saving wretched man from his sins.
Tears of the Sun does nothing but unleash a demeaning onslaught on an African nation, and unflattering abuse on the minds of a generation of Americans, with misrepresentations of the social and political realities in today's Africa.
The movie has no tangible morals, hinges on warped principles, and would be receiving a charitable assessment if it were compared to, say, Commando. Tears of the Sun is, to put it as it is, a lie.

Their mission is to rescue Dr. Lena Kendrix, who is not surprisingly not willing to go, proclaiming, ""what about my people"" which sounds oddly like Moses. What ensues hereafter is scenes of action and the squad wondering why their leader suddenly had a change of heart.
Hollywood likes to end its movies with a big bang, and its no different here of course. This film could have been a whole lot better if the last battle did not happen and Bruce Willis being carried by members of his squad because it does manage to squeeze the cliches in.

ANOTHER WAR MOVIE!"" was the first thing that flashed through my mind.  Now that I have actually seen this movie, I have a very different opinion.  First off, there is action, but not nearly as much as I expected.  It seems as though there are only enough action scenes during the first 3/4 of the movie to keep you interested, then they finally give us the 30 minute finale.  Secondly, most of the movie occurs at night.  Maybe it's just my poor eyesight, but I had a significant amount of trouble trying to see exactly what was happening.  If those were the only problems, the movie would probably be good for about 3.5 to 4 stars.  However, the basis of the movie is flawed.  Bruce Willis plays a hardened Navy S.E.A.L., the elite of the military elite.  He even states at one point to his CO (who he sometimes refers to as ""Bill"") that he has done many of these missions before.  If this is the case, why does he feel remorse for leaving the civilians behind and disobey his direct orders?  This point is further driven into our faces when the team reaches a small village where the guerrillas are brutalizing women and murdering people.  Disobeying yet another direct order (don't fire unless fired upon), the S.E.A.L.s attack and kill their enemies.  They then get emotional and choke-up at the sight of dead civilians.  As stated previously, they have been on these types of missions before and should not act in this manner.  Finally, Willis holds a vote with his men.  If this is how military officers always act, nothing would ever get done.  This movie is just beyond belief.  I suggest that you stick with Black Hawk Down, which has more than enough action, and it evokes the emotions that Tears of the Sun tries to.",1048636800,3,1904,4.541176470588235

The story focuses more on the internal struggles of Willis's character than anything else.  If you watched the trailer and were hoping for Die Hard 4: The African Edition, you will be sorely disappointed.
The plot revolves around a mission by US Navy SEALs to go into a hostile area of Nigeria and rescue an American doctor.  The doctor (Monica Bellucci) is living at Mission, taking care of sick and dying Nigerians.  Getting the doctor out is only a minor hassle, the real trouble begins when Willis' characters internal struggles of following orders vs. doing what is right get the best of him and he decides to try and save all the Nigerian patients.  From there all hell breaks loose and there are a few surprises before the end.
As I said before, this is not your normal action movie.  It doesn't go gonzo on the special effects and explosions, but obviously this is a war movie and there is plenty of violence near the end.  The thing is, by the time people do start dying, you will care.  On a side note, there are several parts of the movie that are unrealistic (the main one being a Navy SEAL going against explicit orders from his commanding officer), but these can be easily forgiven and overlooked.
The combat depicted is on par with the best recent war movies, such as Black Hawk Down and We Were Soldiers.  It's very realistic.

It is not long before Willis and his men, find themselves being chased across the country by an army of 300 ruthless rebels who are tearing up the countryside and killing everything and everyone in sight.  TEARS OF THE SUN is THE SEVEN SAMURAI or THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN set in the jungle. It's about a small band of men defending the innocent from several.
As the lead character, Bruce Willis, who has been so emotionless in most of his recent films brings so much emotion to his lead character by only saying a few words. His face says it all. He is such a commanding presence on the screen that he cannot be ignored. Willis really does carry this movie from beginning to end and combined with a very compelling story, it is difficult to take your eyes off the screen from the opening scene to the closing credits. Most of the supporting characters don't stand out to much aside from Belucci who looks like she's ready to *pop* out of her shirt most of the time and Cole Hauser (PITCH BLACK; HART'S WAR) in what may be his coolest role to date.
Director Antoine Fuqua's follow-up to TRAINING DAY is, for lack of a better word, an awesome movie! It makes one wonder why at one point in time Fuqua wasted his talent with films like BAIT and THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS. He's proven to be the director of the moment.

 I think that is the one word that sums up the sheer insensitiveness, the sheer intolerable ignorance, the untenable blinkeredness, the blithe focus on insulated ideals of American jingoism or (even more despicably) emotional manipulation for bottom-line Greenback payback that this movie uncovers. I use the greenback moniker as a reference to the Almighty Dollar because green is also the national colour of my (often deservedly) maligned nation - Nigeria.
This ailing nation - another in that long-drawn series of failing African republics - happens to be THE LARGEST Negroid conglomeration on earth. Between 1967 - 1970 the east of the country was the epicenter of a well-documented, well covered, TELEVISED civil war which killed over ONE MILLION people: mostly children who starved to death in this fertile, littoral nation because of a genocidal naval blockade imposed by the military government of the day. That war was probably the most tragic of the very very many African blood baths till Congo wrenched the wretched record with its recently concluded attempt at apocalypse. Today Nigeria stands on the brink of a double-edged precipice: on the one side my country is 1 month away from its most important elections in its troubled 43-year history: an election to determine if democracy stays or if military rape is resumed after a 4-year hiatus. On the other hand it just lost a landmark International Court of Justice decision to eastern neighbor Cameroon over the oil-rich peninsula of Bakassi. Because of the humiliation of legal defeat, Nigeria has an armored battalion massed on the tiny peninsula - on the other side of the now defunct border is a similar force of intermittently belligerent French-backed Cameroonian gendarmes. All this is happening at a time when neighboring West African states such as Liberia and Sierra Leone are attempting recovery from horrifyingly fractious civil wars, which were only halted because of the decisive, multi-laterally backed intervention of Nigeria. Meanwhile, even as I write, the region's richest nation Ivory Coast is reeling from a suicidal ethnic insurgency within its army ranks.
Without seeming to lapse into bathos, there's one other point that I must add to my indignant premise before knocking it on the head - on September 16th last year, Norimitsu Onishi/The New York Times published a well researched article about Nigeria's burgeoning film industry (daubed ""Nollywood"") which accurately detailed how Nigerian straight-to-video movies, ""made on the cheap, with budgets of about only $15,000 have become huge hits, with stories, themes and faces familiar to other Africans."" And how it was now conservatively estimated, as a $45 million-a-year industry: miniscule by Hollywood or even Bollywood standards, but huge for a poor continent with more emphasis on food than film.
Now please, please can someone explain to me why ""Tears"" got made the way that it was? A film that whips up a SECOND civil war for Nigeria? A movie whose denouement involves a heroic escape to the ""freedom"" of Cameroon? A movie cast (with an almost guilty, but ultimately purulent condescension) with extras from - CKECK THIS OUT - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Congo, but none from Nigeria or Cameroon? A movie directed by Antoine Fuqua - an African American?
Once again, Nigeria will have to leave judgement to others.

In ""Tears of the Sun,"" he tackles the war film and has as his stars Bruce Willis and the impossibly beautiful Monica Bellucci. The plot is an interesting one with Willis (as A.K. Waters) sent to evacuate Bellucci (as Dr. Lena Hendricks) and some missionaries from an impending ""racial cleansing"" by a band of Nigerian rebels. Lena refuses to leave unless Waters also brings along a group of Nigerian citizens that live in the Mission; and so begins the central conflict of the film.
The combat scenes are on par with and often better than any similar scenes within recent memory including those in ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""We Were Soldiers."" Fuqua shoots these scenes close to the vest and his mise en scene crackles with an otherworldly fire that burns with unrelenting pathos... very similar in mood to ""Apocalypse Now.""
Bruce Willis' A.K. Waters is a stoic, a professional soldier who always follows the party line. But he finds himself, maybe for the first time in his career, doing something that his heart and gut tells him is right. Monica Bellucci is stunningly gorgeous but as she proved in ""Melena,"" she is also a forceful actress.
Though you might have thought that ""Tears of the Sun"" might be another Bruce Willis/Die Hard epic set in Nigeria, it is anything but. What it is, is one of those films that wears its emotions on its sleeve which unexpectedly creeps under you skin and into your heart.",1047600000,12,1529,4.708955223880597
1880747,3,B000096IBT,"I would walk long distances to see Bruce Willis in action. However, in Sun he has toned down a bit and has let some of the supporting actors do most of the heavy stuff.
Cole Hauser, Johnny Messner, Paul Frances, carry the load and do a good job. Tom Skirritt has a cameo.
Monica Bellucci, is very real an is not afraid to have mud on her face. I understand she has a very hard to watch scene in 'IRRREVERSABLE,' a scene that has turned many heads, I will see it when I can.
All in all an action flick with great cinematography,(Mauro Fiore) and good editing (Conrad Buff)
I give it a 3/5

1880750,4,B000096IBT,"13 out of 15 found this review helpful. (I added a sentence or two and the votes were reset.)
As expected, critics are upset at the film's slightly pro-American view (""balanced"" with hints of the darker side, of course). Hollywood.com's reviewer was apparently grinding his?her? teeth so much he couldn't even understand the dialogue:
""When someone points out a potential problem with his strategy, for example, Waters replies, ""There are lots of possible scenarios and I don't presume to know them all."" What great military man would put himself and his men at such risk without considering all the consequences?""
But Waters was responding to the doctor's plea that if they left, the villagers would be killed. His response, above, was simply a cop-out which neither of them believed - nothing to do with what the reviewer supposes. The real complaint these reviewers have is this that (gasp) American soldiers, for all their flaws, are portrayed as heroes:
""... the blind patriotism we are spoon-fed towards the end makes this film a little hard to swallow.""
The ""blind patroitism"" must refer to the refugees' tears and cries of eternal gratitude for the courageous sacrifice that has bought their very lives. And that's the essence of the cries of ""too simplistic,"" ""propaganda,"" ""jingoistic"" - which is code for ""I am  upset that this film does not portray American soldiers as mentally deranged, pot-smoking, homicidal, genocidal, racist, trigger-happy scum of the earth."" We are not given any backstory to explain that the murderous rebels were driven to their life of hatred because their parents couldn't afford to get them ""Boggle"" when they were kids, or any such ""evenhandedness."" Fuqua presents viewers with the stark reality of evil, not the evil of war. He asks us, if we should not intervene in the face of such evil, when should we? If our military cannot be used to overturn such gross inhumanity, what good are we as a nation? This would make any anti-war type squirm.
What did I think? It's intense, brutal, frustrating, and strangely un/sentimental. Willis portrays a thoroughly professional soldier dedicated to carrying out missions to the letter. He makes a thoroughly professional decision to extract only his designated ""target"" - which leads to the uninhibited slaughter of the village where she worked (unsentimental). (The fact that the movie's scenario has Muslims brutalizing Christians - unfortunately not a purely fantastical scenario but one which is being played out today worldwide - will also raise cries of fury and disdain. Of course, if it were the other way around, there would be no complaints. Aren't these critics starting to sicken you, too?)
Waters responds to the good doctor in a way that we would naturally see as unfeeling, even inhuman; but later we see that she has also made a foolish calculation. The refugees' gratitude for Waters' intervention may be interpreted as sentimental, but it's deeper than that. The soldiers are heroes not because they are cowboys - they are heroes because they will sacrifice for a good cause.
Witnessing the slaughter breaks Waters' lifetime of mission discipline. He resolves to lead 70 refugees to Cameroon, at no small cost of peril to himself and his men. The sight of their helicopter whisking into the refugees' view above the trees and landing is one of the most moving moments; I got kind of misty. In fact there are other moments which are more subtle. When Waters gives the chopper the command to turn around, the immediate, unquestioning ""Yes, sir"" speaks volumes. And some critics called this movie ""heavy-handed."" (There is some incoherence ... some parts of the film  imply that they immediately agree with Waters' decision, other parts of the film seem to contradict that.)
In between exacting well-deserved vengeance on their genocidal enemies, they are chased relentlessly, engaging in intense firefights. Every time one of them stands up, you flinch and your guts tie into knots because you just *know* he's going to be hit. The soldiers exude a quiet, professional heroism which is apparently out of vogue in Hollywood, but will make you wish you were there beside them, even with a potato gun. Yes, the scenario is black and white, good against evil, but sometimes that's the reality. Deal with it.",1047254400,41,4303,5.042134831460674
1880751,3,B000096IBT,"Set in the Nigerian jungle shortly after rebels take control of the country, Lt. A.K. Waters (Bruce Willis) and his Navy Seals command unit is sent to rescue an American missionary, Dr. Lena Kendricks (Monica Bellucci) from potential harm. Upon arrival the doctor informs the Navy Seals that she refuses to leave without the rest of her entourage consisting of Nigerian refugee. Under deceptive demise, the Navy Seals lead the refugees along a forty-mile hike to the border of Cameroon while giving them the impression that they are being led to freedom along with Dr. Kendricks. Meanwhile the rebel troops are gaining on them and are intent to destroy the Americans and refugees racing for the border.
While watching TEARS OF THE SUN it is clear that this is a Hollywood movie of good versus evil with no nuance of behavior on either side. Bruce Willis and his soldiers soon come to their senses by realizing that the refugees are humans, not packages while the bad guys are ruthlessly evil as they burn villages and perform mutilations on innocent women while they are still alive. The audience is only left to cheer for the Navy Seals as they are the clear heroes in this jungle. The dialogue often contains pre-packaged snippets of conversation portraying that the soldiers hold a moral obligation to save the refugees from the evil rebels. The viewer cant help to feel the warm, fuzzy feeling in the pit of their stomachs. Its a shame that war is not as straightforward in reality as it is in TEARS OF THE SUN.",1047254400,,1515,4.742424242424242
1880752,4,B000096IBT,"I never expected to be this moved by a Willis film. Exceptional, plus including the Lost Boys into this film shows how Willis and Antoine Fuqua put their heart and soul into the making of a film which we won't forget for a long while.
Critics may be holding back on the kudos this film should be receiving because of their own politics, but the public is all in unison in their acclamation of 'Tears of The Sun'.
It is graphic in nature so may not be suitable for young viewers; however children in other parts of the world live this first hand..it is their life. This film is reality but is filmed respectful to the sensitivity of the viewing audience.",1047168000,4,653,4.404958677685951
1880753,4,B000096IBT,"Tears of the Sun brings Bruce Willis back to the rebel-with-a-cause-and-a-big-gun role. This isn't a date movie. Lots of guerrilla combat, lots of blood and a subplot that is revealed only well into the movie -- and I won't spoil it for you. If the basic plot is nothing new, the film comes together very well, and it outclasses a lot of other action flicks.
Willis (as Lt. Waters) leads his men into Nigeria to rescue an American doctor. In a fit of conscience, after having achieved his mission, Waters orders his choppers to return so that he can rescue the band of doomed refugees. We feel good about that. Especially after seeing what the Nigerian rebels did to the hospital after Waters and company evacuated. If you accept that a special forces lieutenant would disobey orders and follow his conscience, the rest of the story unfolds well.
Visually, Tears of the Sun is a stunner. You will feel as though you spent a couple of hours in the rain forest. Some of the gorier scenes look like the sort of thing that might be omitted from news coverage of such events, but it was enough for me. The pace is intense -- not much time spent chatting around the campfire. I can't vouch for the accuracy of the military operations, but Willis is very credible in this role, and realism tends to win out over dramatic licence. At least until the final sequences.
If you like action films with at least a layer of human interest, you will probably enjoy Tears of the Sun. It falls short only in the ways most desperation mission movies do -- some narrow escapes that require us to be grateful for our heroes without overanalyzing. ... But the overall writing is quite good. ...
Tears of the Sun may not be the film of the year, but it holds together well and kept the audience absorbed. It shows American soldiers as capable, confident and caring. That's a good image, and one that sends you home thinking that our men and women in uniform can do a lot of good.",1047168000,76,1956,4.497191011235955
1880754,4,B000096IBT,"Bruce Willis stars in the action-adventure film `Tears of the Sun'. Willis plays Lt. Waters who is in charge of a S.E.A.L.s team on a routine rescue mission. They are sent in to save a American doctor of a Nigerian mission from rebels that are causing devastation across the country. Unfortunately Dr. Lena Kendricks (Monica Bellucci) talks Lt. Waters into taking the people that she is caring for in her mission. We find that Lt. Waters takes on more to the mission then just a simple rescue. He finds that he cares more and more for the people of the mission instead of having a heart of steal. ""Tears of the Sun"" is about what happens when we do the right thing instead of doing nothing at all. Without the protection of the S.E.A.L.s protection the refugees would have been massacred.
The movie jumps right into the action skipping character development. We learn about the characters during the mission. I found that the movie was exciting to watch but due to the lack of character development in the beginning it takes a while to get comfortable with the movie.
The plot of the movie is intriguing to me. Lt. Water becomes a hero in this fictitious story because he defies specific orders and puts his life and the lives of his team at risk to save many lives that were otherwise not his responsibility.
I give the movie a 4 out of 5 subtracting one point for the slow character development. Some of the reviews bash Willis for his role in the movie, I didn't think he did a bad job. Again you just have to wonder if the professional movie critics are watching the same movie as the rest of us.",1047168000,8,1600,4.482876712328767

1880756,4,B000096IBT,"ok this movie is about the U.S. Seals that have to go to Nigeria in order to rescue an american docter from an attack of rebel forces. These rebel forces kill anyone or anything for their leader. They will not stop. She refuses to leave unless the patients and her friends from nigeria are alowed to go with. So they walk for many miles and finally reach the rescue point, but it ends up that all that time, The captian of the seals was bringing along her friends from nigeria, just to get that docter into the helicopter. So they end up leaving in the heli, and leaving the somewhat wounded and inocent people on the ground, alone. On the flight home, BRuce willis gets a good heart and decides to go back to get them. So he does, and is able to rescue 12 of the mabye 24 of the men. They now have a new extraction point, which is along way away. So they end up fighting multiple forces of rebel troops until the end where they have the main battle sceen. This is about 25 us navy seals verses about 500 rebel forces. Some of the scenes in this movie are disturbing. There is alot of violence and inocent killing. Bruce does an outstanding job acting inn this film. I did not at all feel bored throughout this film. There is not a TON of action in the film, but enough to keep me interested.",1047081600,,1292,4.213709677419355
1880757,4,B000096IBT,"There is nothing spectacular about Tears of the Sun. Nor is there anything original. You've seen it all before. Tears of the Sun is very much a cross between Rambo: First Blood Part II, Platoon, and Black Hawk Down.
This marks the third movie from action director Antione Fuqua (Replacement Killers, Training Day) who's most remembered from his gritty realism of the streets in Training Day. Fuqua's knact for taking characters out of there hollywood stereotypes and making them seem like they could really exist was part of the appeal to his last film, and he mostly succeeds in doing the same in this film. There are a couple points where he fails such as in the portrayal of the beautiful Dr. Hendricks who despite living in the jungle without running water or electricity and spending all her days tending to sick and wounded looks positively radiant under all that make up she must have air dropped in. Next are the new and improved touchy feely SEALs that are on this rescue mission to get Dr. Hendricks out of hostile territory. We even get to see SEALs cry. This has got to be a first.
But despite some of the things that make you wonder, ""would that really happen,"" at it's heart Tears of the Sun is an emotional film set in real world events about a group of innocent people trying to escape evil. The evil in this case is the ethinic cleansing (genocide) by the new ruling government. Fuqua adeptly shows you the danger these people are in, and even if the SEALs act unbelievably at parts, he successfully transforms them from robotic commandos to men who become heroes. By the time you reach the film's climactic finish, you really do care not only about the people they are trying to save, but also the SEALs themselves.
Fuqua's final fault is not developing the members of the SEAL team instead leaving it to be Willis and Co., but in the end Tears of the Storm is a classic story of heroes risking life and limb to save those who cannot save themselves. I just may be a sucker for hero movies, but Tears of the Storm is better than it looks and a good reason to go to the movies in this sparse movie season.",1047081600,2,2122,4.48578811369509
1880758,5,B000096IBT,"Tears of the Sun is about a group of US Special Forces soldiers sent into Nigeria to extract a doctor called Lena Hendrix.  But when they get there, she is unwilling to go with them unless they take around 70 refugees with them who will, without a doubt be killed by Nigerian forces if left there.  The SEALs are severly outnumbered; and are told 5,000 Nigerian soldiers are advancing to their position.  With the risk mounting, their commanders tell them that it's too dangerous to go into Nigerian airspace and pull out leaving the SEALs greatly outnumbered and with people to protect.
It's by the director of Training Day: Antoine Fuqua so it can't be bad.  I can't wait to see this movie and I recommend it to anyone who likes war/special forces types of movies and in particular to anyone who liked Ridley Scott's masterpiece, Black Hawk Down as well...",1047081600,4,858,4.662251655629139
