a former union drummer,  I was sensitive to the unhurried and careful instructions presented in the dvd, but also to the rhythmic content --not to overlook the excellent music used for Minery's closing routine.

Up to this day, I have no way of reviewing the items purchused because they have not as yet arrived. When can I finally expect them? This is my first order with amazon. I am a little disappointed.
