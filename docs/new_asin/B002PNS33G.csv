4504508,4,B002PNS33G,"I love the Judge Deed series and am looking forward to the release of Series 6. I was hoping that Series 5 (episode 1) would've cleared up some of the loose ends from the final episode of the previous series. For instance, they could have included a scene or two about Jo's recuperation from the car accident and what, if any, legal punishment Sir Tim Listfield's henchman received for trying to kill John Deed. Jo's sudden ""rethinking"" her feelings for John is interesting, but it is not fully realized. Does she truly believe John is incapable of loving just her? Does she really love Mark, or is he just a ""means to an end"" for her to get closer to her former foster son Michael? These loose ends are a little frustrating for devoted viewers.
The courtroom dramas are very well done and compelling. Judge Dee's daughter and ex-wife, Charlie and George, are given some great courtroom time, too. It should also be noted that Rita ""Coop"" Cooper's character develops more in Series 5, allowing viewers to get a glimpse behind her sometimes far away gazes and underlyong sadness.
Overall, a must-see for anyone who has followed the previous 4 series. It was great, but I think it could've been just a little bit better.",1341360000,3,1218,4.669767441860465
4504509,3,B002PNS33G,"Martin Shaw is a good actor - the entire cast here is good.  But by Season Five, the character, Judge John Deed, is getting a bit wearing.  At some point you'd think he'd grow up.  I think they should've stopped after Season Four.  This is just same-old same-old.",1339632000,,263,4.416666666666667
4504510,5,B002PNS33G,"excellent i love it unfortunately i allready had it,thought it was the next series,when does the next one come out,can you email me...regards diane",1333756800,,147,5.166666666666667
4504511,4,B002PNS33G,"One can hardly go wrong with any program that features Martin Shaw.  I've watched him in two different roles - Judge Deed and George Gently.  Very different scripts but Mr. Shaw carries his roles in an excellent, very well played manner.  One compliment I give to most English actors is their talent for the right expression. The raise of an eyebrow tells volumes.  In this series of John Deed, while very good,  my criticisms are, I find too many subplots.  Also Judge Deed and his lady are getting tiresome with their on again off again relationship.  Maybe more sessions with an analyst will help the judge.  That is if he doesn't want to have an affair with her.",1323475200,4,666,4.584745762711864
4504512,4,B002PNS33G,when do we get series 5 and 6 in us format?  i have all the others and i really enjoy the series  will it be advertised?,1321056000,5,120,3.576923076923077
4504513,1,B002PNS33G,"The four episodes here given of Series 5 are splendid, like the rest, but are two too few. There are two missing episodes of Series 5, apparently banned by the BBC for political reasons.  They  are apparently available if you Google long enough (see comments attached to these reviews)--we are trying with difficulty to get them now--But Amazon could get them more easily than individuals, if it would only make the effort.  However,Amazon NEVER responds to customer comment or complaints (I tried their ""arbitration""  process, in a different context, and it's ludicrous).  The easy is something they do very well.  But don't expect them to take one step beyond that. They don't listen, and their system of customer feedback is a fraud, EXCEPT that customers do get to talk to each other.  Perhaps if we make enough noise, Amazon may one day read/hear us and get the point.",1301529600,65,873,4.858108108108108
4504514,4,B002PNS33G,"Martin Shaw is Judge John Deed and the whole series is exceptional value for lovers of courtroom drama and it's sidelines.
I was concerned about this being a region 2 but it and all the others from Britian have played very well in New Zealand.
The whole deal was stress free from beginning to end and I fully recommend Amazon goods here.  Thank you very much for hours
of wonderful entertainment.",1281225600,4,396,4.577464788732394
4504515,5,B002PNS33G,"The episodes in this set are.. Hard-Gating, My Daughter-Right or Wrong, Lost Youth, Silent Killer.  Evidently 2 episodes were held back due to rights issues",1253059200,25,156,5.24
4504516,4,B002PNS33G,"After following the complete Judge John Deed series, I was deeply disapointed after learning that the Season 5 DVD only contains 4 episodes i.e. 1-4, and episodes 5 and 6 of season 5 is not included in the box.",1250985600,49,210,4.410256410256411
4504517,5,B002PNS33G,"Ranks among our top mystery series, along with Luther, Endeavor and Jack Taylor.  Great cast and a nice combination of mystery, humor and drama.  It's fun to watch deed outfox the Thatcher types who try to manipulate him.",1434931200,,221,4.7894736842105265
4504518,3,B002PNS33G,I purchased all 6 Series of Judge John Deed only to find the story line did not continue from Ep 4 Series 5 to start of Series 6.  This is really disappointing as I am a great fan of this series.  Please release the two missing episodes.,1430697600,,237,4.0212765957446805

4504523,5,B002PNS33G,The Brits do some TV serials very well and John Deed falls in that category. Very enjoyable watch indeed.,1411948800,,105,4.578947368421052
4504524,4,B002PNS33G,"Loved all this series but this was the shortest season.  Wish it would have continued.  Really enjoyed all their stories.  There were 2 episodes that were not on this dvd, you can watch them on U-tube.",1410307200,8,201,4.527777777777778

4504526,3,B002PNS33G,"I love and own the entire Judge John Deed series but am VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THE LAST TWO EPISODES ARE MISSING FROM SERIES 5!!
Amazon are you ever going to release the complete series? I would certainly purchase it as it is not only good viewing but it also continues the continuity of the story line between the Judge, Jo and the doctor. Series 6 starts abruptly with John in The Hague .
After all these years surely the censorship can be lifted????
VERY Disappointed !!!!",1393545600,10,475,4.534883720930233
4504527,1,B002PNS33G,"Terrible, disappointed and frustration words that express my feelings that 2 episodes were not included in my purchase.  Others had expressed this deliberate omission but I failed to read the reviews because I am an avid fan of judge deed already.  I am positive this omission will never be corrected but count me as one who believes in freedom of speech.",1388102400,,355,4.80327868852459
4504528,5,B002PNS33G,"I am a great fan of this series, although it must be admitted that the court room procedure displayed is pretty far removed from reality.  Nevertheless, the plotting is good and the characters well portrayed with an intiguing mixture of sympathetic victims and villainous establishment figures.  Martin Shaw's character is multi-faceted, though slightly less believable in his amorous adventures. Donald Sinden's cameo roles are a joy to watch.

While it is best if the series is watched from the beginning, each episode is sufficiently complete in itself.",1387497600,,556,5.367816091954023
4504529,4,B002PNS33G,"The series was really getting meaty then the network had to buckle to the censors because the science was flawed.  Too bad they didn't get a chance to correct some of the errors and still come up with an intelligent continuing drama.  It would have been interesting to see the judge wrestle with decisions based on erroneous data.  (The missing episodes can be found on YouTube so that the continuity isn't totally lost.)  Otherwise this is such good, intelligent drama offering considerable insight into the workings of the British legal system, with of course the spice of the humans' lives.  Okay so the ""snogging"" is getting a little bit more unbelievable maybe, but Martin Shaw...., he's still got it, and the depicted relationships are really well written and portrayed by this excellent cast.",1382745600,7,799,4.977443609022556
4504530,5,B002PNS33G,"I love this series.  I can't wait until each season comes out so I can get it and watch it.  It's hard not to sit down and watch it straight through, but I don't have that much time in one spot!  It's worth the wait to continue to watch it, though!!!!",1365811200,,251,3.8823529411764706
4504531,5,B002PNS33G,This DVD only  includes 4 of the 6 episodes.  After much research I was able to find episodes 5 and 6.  I can honestly see no reason for them being excluded - especially as the topics continue in the story line for season 6.  Shame on BBC,1361232000,8,238,4.0

4504536,4,B002PNS33G,"I have enjoyed every season of Judge John Deed and can only say that the episodes keep getting better and better. My only disappointment was that the episodes ended and I was hoping for more. I was able to pre order season six and am looking forward to more of the predicaments of Judge Deed, his daughter, and his on again-off again relationships. I was disappointed that there were not more episodes in the series (5). If they were withheld for political reasons, censorship, or copyrights issues, than it is a disappointment. In any case, the episodes that are available with the series are first rate !",1343088000,3,606,4.672897196261682

8449270,4,B002PNS33G,"Feel cheated that two of the series are missing.  Totally breaks up the flow of the story line from season five to season 6.  Also, why can't we purchase season 3 in the US.",1496620800,,173,4.0588235294117645

8449275,3,B002PNS33G,"I love this series. I am beyond miffed that Episodes 5 and 6 of Season 5 have been omitted from this and all DVD's, even British, of this season. (For the infuriating reasons for this omission read this review: http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/54268/judge-john-deed-season-5/) When you watch Season 6 you will constantly wonder WTF happened. Having said this, go ahead and buy it. The 4 episodes are extremely good. Just don't expect any resolution to an important case that is started, nor info on where Jo's relationship with Marc goes.",1441324800,,536,5.244186046511628

8449277,3,B002PNS33G,"Missing, censored episodes about the alleged side effects of vaccinations left us in the dark about how the impending marriage between Jo Mills and Mark fell apart.  Couldn't find much of synopsis online to fill in the blanks, either.  BBC should have redone the 2 offensive (probably to the government and big pharma only) to remove the parts that concerned them, but maintained the story line about the dissolving romance.  We have no idea why or how the relationship fizzled!",1438041600,2,478,4.95
