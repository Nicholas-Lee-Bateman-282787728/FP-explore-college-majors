3036120,3,B000YV1L6M,"I only found the ""Kicks"" section effective. The rest of the DVD was hardly a workout - definitely not recommended for intermediate level exercisers - only for beginners. Super annoying is the fact that the DVD forces you to view the 2 minute Gaiam advertisement every single time. I only use the DVD for the Kicks section if I want to extend another workout a bit - I'll probably stop using it even for that since 2 minutes go to waste watching the Gaiam ad!",1424908800,2,458,4.4

3036123,4,B000YV1L6M,Patricia Moreno is an excellent teacher who explains the moves in an easy to understand way. Great video if you want to improve your form. Each section is a good workout by themselves or all together.  Good for beginners through intermediate. I only wish there was a cool down.,1406419200,,277,4.653061224489796

3036127,4,B000YV1L6M,"Most workout videos are extremely patronizing.  When they speak, they think they are motivating you, but instead they address you as if you were an idiot, a child, or both.  It's insulting and patronizing, silly and fake.

Patricia has a way of speaking and presenting herself that she comes across confident, serious, yet motivating.  She let's you know and makes you feel like you came here to work, and that it's going to take some time, but that you will make it.  Sheputs you at ease but asks of you to put in the work.  The backgrounds a soothing, the music challenging and focus instead of loud and distracting.  In short: she speaks to you, not shouts at you.

This is a low-intensity workout.  Her marketers (greedy and deceiving as marketers usually are) advertise this product as any other workout series is advertised: hard, complete, challenging, promising the world and olympic results.  The truth is that this is an alternative (or at the very least, different) workout; it's easy, low impact, although you can mnake it harder by doing the moves bigger, faster, and harder.  Just don't expect a complicated workout.  This is for beginners or for people very out of shape.  I just wish they would advertise it as such, since I believe there is an untapped market of out-of-shape people that are intimidated by workout products they feel are too advanced or out-of-reach for them, and this would be a great alternative for them.  I also wish there were more advanced workouts that would implement Patricia's approach: not patronizing, not condescending, but genuine, confident, focused, challenging, and still entertaining.",1363392000,5,1636,4.988929889298893
3036128,4,B000YV1L6M,"Overall I enjoy this workout and I always feel great afterwards.  The instructor is upbeat and explains each move well.  I think she does a great job of letting you know which muscles the move is intended to focus on, and continually reminds you to relax your neck and tighten your abs which I appreciate.  Just a few negatives for me:
-The music is a bit odd.  It is some type of tribal/dance blend which doesn't always keep a constant beat.  That makes it difficult to count on your own but instead forces you to look at the screen when you otherwise might not.
-I would not consider this DVD to contain ""(4) separate 20 minute workouts"" or whatever the description claims.  The menu options on the DVD really just allow you to skip to different places in 1 full workout.  So the first and last 20 minute segments contain warmup and cool down, as well as less strenuous exercises while your body warms up.  I usually just do all 4 segments straight through so that I capture the warm up and cool down.",1360368000,3,1003,4.413043478260869

3036141,5,B000YV1L6M,"I think this dvd is great. I recently read the reviews to see if I could get another recommendation for any other workout dvds in this category and decided I needed to review it for others. This dvd will make you sweat without leaving your house. It works muscles that you might not if you do treadmill and eliptical and swimming. It does get you sweating without overworking your feet and knees. She's not annoying, just encouraging. There are just a couple of 'glitches' but who can do an hour of workout without messing up just a little. The people in the background are ok, the setting is nice. It moves along well, teaching you moves and then building on them. The first session does not say 'warmup' but thats basically what it is. It then takes you into the boxing part, the third session is kicking and the last session combines all moves and goes into a cooldown. If you do the whole dvd it takes about an hour. This is exactly what I was looking for, a good workout, sweat, working different muscles, makes the time fly, is more than 20-30 minutes, the people are not annoying and I can do it in my house when I don't feel like leaving it (bad weather). Hope this helps others.",1358035200,3,1187,4.4
3036142,5,B000YV1L6M,"I really like this workout!  It is fun to do, and unlike some workouts the instructor doesn't go so fast that you get lost.  After doing it I feel I had a good workout, but I don't feel like I'm going to collapse.  It doesn't put too much strain on my knees.  Later, I may get the rest of her workout videos.",1347408000,,308,3.9193548387096775
3036143,5,B000YV1L6M,"I've been using this dvd for a month now and I love it so much.  Great core work out, right along with working arms, butt and legs.  I bought it, not having ever taken a kick boxing class before and now I love kick boxing.  I will be buying more of Patricia Moreno's kick boxing videos for sure.",1347235200,,295,4.051724137931035
3036144,4,B000YV1L6M,"We have tried a few other kickboxing DVDs and this is the one we liked.  Honestly, none of these ""kickboxing"" exercise DVDs really teach you how to do kickboxing.  It's more like the instructor strung up a series of kickboxing moves to create a workout for you to break a sweat.

I actually like the instructor, she's pretty clear about what she wants you to do next.  Her cues are not perfect but compared to some other kickbox instructors I gave her 4 out of 5 stars.  My husband is the most uncoordinated person and he usually has a hard time with exercise DVDs.  He actually likes Moreno and he can follow all the punches and part of the kicks even on day one.

Some people complain Moreno talked too much and there were too many talking breaks.  Personally I think it's a good thing for people without a lot of kicking and punching experience.  In order to punch and kick correctly (without hurting yourself) one must learn how to create a solid base and to utilize the core.  Trying to keep up with all the combinations is challenging enough for beginners, let alone keeping properly body position.  Moreno's constant cues remind me to keep my core engaged for a proper and injury-free workout.

The first time I did this workout I spent a lot of time trying to figure out the moves so I didn't break a sweat.  The second time I did it I was able to keep up with the combination and I really sweated this time.  So if you have tried it once and it didn't seem to be a good workout, don't give up on it just yet.

I do have a minor complaint about this DVD.  There are four parts of this exercise DVD: Punches, Core Energizer, Kicks, and Combination.  The first time I viewed this DVD I couldn't get Punches and Core Energizer to play.  When I tried ""play all"" it went straight to the Kicks part then continued on to Combination.  I tried clicking on the ""Punches"" part directly but it kept taking me back to the main menu screen.  I really thought I had a defective DVD and that we're missing two out of four parts.  But on the third day I made another attempt and this time the Punches began to play.  As of today, the scene selection is still unreliable but at least now I know if I keep clicking on Punches it will eventually play.  I like long workout and I wish the combination was a bit longer. I have already learned all the punches and kicks, I would like to go straight to Combination for a good workout  But the combination part is very short.  It felt like that I have just gotten into the rhythm then the workout was over.",1332892800,,2540,4.30801687763713
3036145,2,B000YV1L6M,"I'm not entirely certain what type of person the intended target for this DVD was, but it certainly is not me.  It doesn't really cut it as a cardio work out, as most of the segments are too slow with too much down time in between each series of combinations while the instructor demonstrates what you will be doing.  It doesn't really cut it as a toning workout, either, as there really is not much in the way of resistance.  It won't work as a beginner's workout, because many of the moves/combinations are too difficult (and possibly dangerous) to be done by someone who has never worked out before.  The only segment that I found enjoyable and worthwhile as a cardio workout only lasted ten minutes before she started cooling down.",1330300800,,735,4.587786259541985
3036146,5,B000YV1L6M,"She explains the moves well without slowing down the workout.  At first, the moves feel kinda easy, but with repetitions you can really feel it working your core.  A new favorite!",1312243200,,179,4.741935483870968
3036147,5,B000YV1L6M,"If you're looking for an easy going exercise video, this is not for you!  I was curious when I bought this product about kick boxing, and  I love it!  However, I didn't expect it to kick my butt as much as it does!  It requires a lot of effort and energy on my part, and I have to want to do it in order to do it well.  I only do the workout three times a week because otherwise I know I'll get sick of it and I'll stop putting in effort altogether.  Great video by Gaiam, as usual; the instructions are easy to follow and the instructor goes through everything with you slowly, begins to pick up the pace, and then applies it into a workout.  You learn as you go with this video.  I recommend it to those who really want to work hard to get in shape or lose a few pounds.  This video harnesses a lot of your inner strength, and I've found it to be helpful in my own health goals.",1302393600,,880,3.9545454545454546

3036149,1,B000YV1L6M,"This really should get zero stars. I find it disturbing this work out dvd has as many good rating as it does. I have been doing kick boxing on and off for about five or six years now, the last several months being on. I purchased this dvd recently to mix it up. The choregraphy in this work out is horrible and it goes at a ridiculously slow pace in some spots, not to mention the same movements are done over and over and over and over and over again, so its not much of a workout. The set is hard to watch, and the dvd does not time the workouts. This is absolutely ridiculous, and its a horribly designed workout. There is no point in doing this tape, you are better off doing a workout where you actually burn some calories and don't waste time slowly repeating the same movements over and over again. This is not a pilates dvd after all. It deserves zero stars and is not a good or even decent kickboxing or cardio workout.",1300665600,7,928,4.189944134078212
3036150,4,B000YV1L6M,"This is certainly a tough workout. I do intense cross training six days a week and have been doing kickboxing for about two years now. I've certainly survived more difficult classes but this still got me working up a sweat.

Patricia is very good with audio cues and easing into the moves so you can learn the combinations. As other reviewers pointed out, there are a few drawbacks. It is strange that there isn't a ""play all"" button for the sections of the workout, but it's really not that big of a deal. And I also agree that she talks WAY too much, but to be honest, if you can just block some of it out, it's worth it to stick through it because this is a very good kickboxing DVD. Definitely recommend.",1298678400,,708,4.323308270676692
3036151,3,B000YV1L6M,"I could say ditto to the review of ""Chrevolet67Impala."" Just way too much explanation that leads to the heart rate coming down too much, and the supposedly inspirational comments I found to be completely cheesy. Kind of bugs me though, because had it been better edited, I would have given it maybe 4 stars. The other issue is that it doesn't really get going until the ""core"" section, so I will just avoid the ""punches"" section completely in future (1st of 4 segments). That said, there are some interesting moves in here, and towards the mid to end it gets much better. I will probably use it in future for light days when I don't feel like doing too much - for a kickboxing routine it's pretty laid back. Not to say you won't get your heart rate up a bit, but just not a ""normal"" kickboxing workout. Would have been good with a music only option. I think people making these DVDs forget that they are going to be used over and over, and this just increases the irritation level of all the unnecessary explanations that you can't easily skip...the moves were mostly straightforward and an intro section would easily cover it for newbies.",1280880000,,1139,4.560975609756097

3036153,5,B000YV1L6M,I've been kickboxing off and on for years.  I had read the reviews and was hesitant about ordering the kickboxing with Patricia Moreno but I will tell you she's the absolute best!  I had been doing Billy Blanks for years and while he's quite fast and good I found this one to be well cued and effective.  I didn't expect to be sore but first time I was sore for 2 days.  She is repetitive which makes this so effective because you spend a lot of time concentrating on the move and not how fast it can be executed.  Thumbs up all the way!,1251676800,4,537,4.125
3036154,4,B000YV1L6M,"This was my first workout with Patricia Mareno as an instructor, and I have to say that, overall, I am very pleased.  I tried this workout yesterday, and was impressed with how easy the moves were, but how she really keeps the energy going with these simple moves.  There are four main workouts on this DVD, as other reviewers have already explained, and they are all very solid.  Here's the breakdown:

The good:

1) This is a nice cardio workout for the most part.  It is low-impact (no jumping or plyo moves), and it is nice to see a low-impact workout still raise your heart rate effectively.  If you're in reasonable shape, this workout isn't going to make the sweat pour off you, but that doesn't necessarily mean the workout isn't doing what it should.
2) Moves are simple, for the most part, and easy to pick up.
3) The emphasis on the core and how to correctly hold your core was very nice to me, and told me a lot about why I developed some injuries in the past in my lower back.  Instruction on that was very helpful.
4) The instructor takes the time to show you a slower form of the move first, and actually lets you practice the move before she speeds it up.
5) I was feeling this workout all over by the time I went to bed--it really works your entire core, if you listen to her instructions on what to do with your belly, shoulders, etc.  Great workout if you want to confuse those muscles and break out of a routine.

Needs improvement:

1)I did not find her cueing to be as effective as it could have been.  It was better than most instructors, but there were times when I would have appreciated her calling out the moves more often BEFORE they changed.  This would be very helpful for when she is putting together all the individual moves into combos.
2) No modifications were shown for the moves.  With four people behind her, you'd think at least one of them could have been shouted a reminder to show a modified move!
3) Even though this is low-impact, there are some twisting moves that are had on the knees if you have bad knees.  Also, during the first two workouts you're pretty much standing in horse/warrior stance the entire time.  This got a little irritating on my hip joints.

Some minor annoyances:

1) Did ANYONE else find the one guy behind her to look a little disturbing?  His poofy hair kept distracting me, and it looked like he wandered onto the set and they put him in the video.
2) Nowhere on the DVD packaging does it tell you the length of each of the workouts.  (If it's there, someone please tell me where!)  I like to know how long segments are so I can plan my workouts.

Overall, I really liked the workout and the instructor.  I will definitely be putting this workout in my rotation.",1247788800,5,2733,4.389662027833002
3036155,5,B000YV1L6M,"This particular workout has a focus on the core throughout the entire video. The instructor starts with basic movements and then builds on them from there. The workout is challenging, but there are short breaks and it is not so hard that you want to just give up and throw the DVD in the trash. Patricia Moreno is a great instructor; she uses great cuing, is motivating but still with a pleasant demeanor. It was easier for me to get through the workout with this instructor vs. some others I have worked out to. There is a short portion of a core workout with a cool-down at the end. Good video!",1246147200,,596,4.378378378378378
3036156,5,B000YV1L6M,"While I was doing this workout, I kept thinking that I was wasting my time.  It felt too easy & fun to be effective.  But WOW I sure was sore the next day!  And the second day!  It was a lot of fun & the time flew by for me.  I would definitely recommend this dvd for someone new to kickboxing.  It's a great way to learn.",1245369600,,322,3.7313432835820897
3036157,4,B000YV1L6M,"I workout almost every day and am always looking for new workouts, but I'm very picky about buying DVDs because too many workouts get old very fast.  I really liked this workout, although there are some flaws.

PROS:
*  Great cardio workout.  You FEEL it in your thighs and abs before the workout is even over.  Plus, I like that Patricia Moreno emphasizes how to focus on your core.  Too many instructors assume you know this, but it's really good to hear it again so you can get the most out of every exercise/movement.
*  No jumping.  If, like me, your knees, ankles and feet need a break every now and then, but you still want a cardio workout, this is a good one for those days.  I was totally winded at the end my first few times doing it and I'm in pretty good shape.
*  Some people hate this, but I really liked Ms. Moreno's affirmations.  She has a catch phrase, ""if you give 100%, you will improve 100%"" that she repeats, but I liked the reminder that I'm going to get back what I put in.  If you don't need this, or don't like it, I would say just laugh when she says it, or come up with your own quip to think when she says it.
*  Good timing on the moves.  By that I mean, she doesn't do any one movement too much at a time, but comes back to the moves in combination so you feel like you are building up to something.
*  Some people complain that there are no modifications, but she works into each move from a ""base"" move, so you can always fall back to that if it gets too hard for your level.  As a person with bad knees and feet, I didn't find anything too hard, though sometimes I didn't bend as deep as she did, or kept my moves smaller than hers until I was up to that level.
*  The beautiful background (it's filmed outside somewhere in the Southwest US) is really nice.  Look for the cars driving in the background.  I find that humorous and diverting when I'm having tough days =).  The music is also good and not the same old, same old that I've been finding on so many DVDs these days.

CONS:
* My biggest pet peeve with DVDs is when the instructor loses count or is off the music.  It doesn't happen often in this video, but she does go off the music a few times, and in the final run through of the cardio core sequence she skips part of the sequence.
* The DVD for some reason doesn't have a PLAY ALL option, so you have to stop and click on each section when you want to progress.  Also, the cool down is at the end of the Combination section, so you have to play that section and then fast forward through the chapters if you are doing a shorter workout that day.  There is no chapter listing to go there through a menu.

Overall, I think this is a very good workout and something I can do again and again without getting sick of it.  If you can, rent it on Netflix or try it out first to see if you agree.",1244246400,37,2837,4.075812274368231
3036158,4,B000YV1L6M,"This workout is pretty good and effective.  I agree that Ms. Moreno talks a little too much during the video, but if you just try to block her voice out and pay attention to the music you'll do okay.  The workout itself can definitely make you break a sweat, and you can modify moves for intensity levels.  The only thing I would suggest is to be careful of form.  During the kick section, Ms. Moreno has a lot of twisting lunges and kicks that she calls Jenga (sp?) preps and kicks.  I call them curtsy lunges, and they can kill your knees if they are bad to start, so be careful of your form, or just go into a regular lunge rather than a curtsy lunge.",1241136000,,654,4.158730158730159
3036159,5,B000YV1L6M,I recently purchased this DVD after renting it first from our hospital library.  The DVD starts out slowly with Patricia showing you the movements.  It then progresses at a quicker pace to then an intense series of movements. I would agree that this DVD is not for beginners but for the intermediate to advanced levels.  I have been exercising for years and I found this DVD a worthwhile investment to add to my library.,1238630400,,420,4.648648648648648
3036160,3,B000YV1L6M,"I exercise everyday and although I'm not an expert when it comes to kick boxing I do have a little experience, and I found this video very  easy. The pace was to slow 90% of the time causing my heart rate to stay fairly low. The moves are cool, especially when mixed and the bonus workout has a lot of great stretches. Overall, I'd be great if Patricia didn't talk so much and cut straight to the moves.",1237852800,3,403,4.166666666666667
3036161,1,B000YV1L6M,I never received this video. I e-mailed them about it and they never responded. I am very unhappy!!,1237766400,,99,4.555555555555555
3036162,4,B000YV1L6M,"This is a good video for the intermediate-to-advanced exerciser.  I do not recommend it for anyone who has knee problems, back problems, or any abnormality that causes difficulty in balancing.

My advice is to start off doing 1 segment at a time.  Very few people will ever work their way up to doing the whole thing all at once.  I like to do 2 segments at a time, and alternate days with a lower-intensity video.  I like the fact that I can get a good workout without having to use weights or incorporate any other props.  As a point of reference, you should know that I am 32 years old, exercise 5-6 days/week, and am not overweight at all.",1234828800,,643,4.361344537815126
3036163,5,B000YV1L6M,"I have a gadzillion DVDs and this is my favorite. I love kickboxing workouts, and this one actually is good at communicating how to correctly perform kicks and punches. Patricia Moreno is irresistibly motivating, with such a can-do sunniness you actually think it's easier than it is. She is so gorgeously toned, you want to look like her, too. The music is well-chosen, and the location is beautiful, and the workout is really fun. I love that it's divided into several sections so you can customize your workout. If you do them all, you get more than an hour, so it's a really good value. Plus, it's quite strenuous, especially in some sections, so you do get quite a workout. The combos are really fun, but I had to do the tape three or more times before I got them right.",1233360000,,775,4.50354609929078
3036164,5,B000YV1L6M,"As I am always on the lookout for a new workout and instructors to motivate me I had my local library order this for me so I could take it for a test run.  This one is definitely on my wish list now.  Though some could find Patricia's style too chatty, I thought she had the perfect blend of motivation without constantly talking.  She cues the moves well and has good form.  The scenery is beautiful with red rocks in the background, shot in Snow Canyon, Utah.  The music was fitting to the work-out in my opinion and had a good beat.  I have done some Kickbox workouts before and I would say as far as challenging kickbox moves I'd say no, but challenging for my core and working my lower body....absolutely.  If you are looking for an advanced ""kickboxing"" workout though, this may not be what you are looking for.  The emphasis here is on cross training and your core.

The workout has several sections, punches (about 13 minutes),core training (about 25 minutes), kicks (about 18 minutes), Combo/Cooldown (9/5 minutes), and an additional bonus workout (about 14 minutes).

The first time I did the workout I did punches & core training and stretched on my own after (there is no extensive cool down until the last segment of the dvd, so I would recommend extra stretching on your own).  The next day I did kicks, combo and the bonus. At the end of the week I tried all segments together, making an 80 minute plus workout.

I exercise daily, doing a variety of work-outs-Salsa, Aerobic, Tae-Bo, Yoga, Pilates, etc.  and though I thought at first this wouldn't challenge me enough, I found the pace to be aerobic and though the moves weren't hard, the workout definitely kept my heart rate up and worked muscles that I obviously had not recently worked this hard.  I most definitely felt my muscles even after a couple days after that first workout (core, butt, arms, and inner thigh).
One caution is to be careful while doing on carpet where you are pivoting you will need to be mindful of not twisting your knee.

In the bonus section, I would caution if you have wrist problems as this section is primarily variations of yoga's ""plank"" position (looks like the beginning of a push up).  I am very familiar with plank as it is part of my yoga practice, but still felt her variations were challenging and will build strong and shapely arms (Who doesn't want that?).

Overall, an excellent workout.  I would definitely purchase this item and will also be looking to try more of Patricia's dvds in the future.",1226793600,6,2511,4.591928251121076

Much better.",1220918400,5,366,4.154929577464789
3036167,4,B000YV1L6M,"How intense you find this workout will depend a lot on your current fitness level and how hard you prefer to work out.  As a basis for comparison, I am 55, overweight and just getting back into better shape again after a 5-month ""fall off the exercise wagon"" due to a move and an illness.  I have experience with kickboxing workouts and enjoy kickboxing quite a lot.  I prefer moderate workouts most of the time with occasional intense workouts.  For me, as an example, Tae-bo is relatively intense.

I found this workout relatively intense because it uses the large muscle groups so much--there is a lot of lunging, kicking and squatting.  It is not a cardio workout in the traditional sense, but it most definitely had me sweating.  I also found it intense in terms of my knees--and that isn't a good thing (hence 4 stars vs. 5).  There is an incredible amount of foot twisting in this workout and, with older knees and a carpeted surface, that can make for a really punishing workout.  If you're young, you probably won't notice or care.  If you're older or have had knee injuries, you'll probably want to rent this first and give it a try to see whether/how much it bothers you.

Patricia Moreno is a good and inspirational leader (she also has amazing arms and shoulders).  She cues relatively well and does a slow breakdown of some of the more complicated moves before she actually starts doing them at full speed--I liked that a LOT because I get easily frustrated if I can't catch something on the first try.

The workout, which is filmed with a beautiful Utah mountain/canyon backdrop, includes four main segments plus a bonus power workout:

Punches:  Concentrates on punching (upper body) but still uses the lower body.

Core Energizer:  Focuses on your core, but still features both the upper and lower body with punching and squatting.  Even though this segment is focused on the core, it is all done standing (i.e., not traditional crunches and such).

Kicks:  Concentrates on kicking (lower body).  Having done a LOT of kickboxing workouts, I appreciated Patricia's method of teaching kicks.  She does a good job of giving you a foundation for kicking.

Combinations:  In this segment, you take what you've learned and put it all together--punching and kicking at the same time while keeping your core engaged.

Bonus Power Workout:  I haven't tried this one yet.  I'd read a review that said it was tough.  I watched it and thought ""Yikes!""  This workout is on the mat and features some positions that I'm pretty sure I couldn't get into. :)  I think this is more the territory of the advanced exercisor just from watching it.

I wouldn't say it's the best kickboxing workout I've done, but it is clear that I not only worked hard during the workout but felt it the next day (and sometimes longer).

P.S. Edited to add that I wanted to ditto another reviewer's comment that this workout could have included modifications for beginners or those with knee injuries, etc., but did not.  That is a disappointment.",1219363200,4,3025,4.744721689059501

3036169,5,B000YV1L6M,"Patricia Moreno leads this workout and she's really good.  She cues well and is motivating.  I like that it's filmed outdoors instead of an indoor set - I for some reason find that more motivating because I'm thinking of Summer.  It's geared for intermediate to advanced exercisers although the choreography isn't too complicated.
It's a great calorie burning workout that helps increase balance and strength.  If you think about it, you can really feel your core engage while doing this.  The segments start to get harder as the workout goes on, and I admit I found the kickboxing combos a little challenging and took a while to get more comfortable with it.  You'll really feel your muscles the next day for sure.  My favourite part of it all though is the stretch at the end.  It's so relaxing and deserved after finishing this.  I've even done the stretch segment at the end of a day without having done a workout because I find it so relaxing.
Overall, this is a great workout.  It will burn fat and get you fitter.  I really enjoy it and hope you will too.",1213747200,28,1062,4.5661375661375665

I like a challenge as much as the next person, but if you're like me and you basically hate to exercise in the first place and you're looking for a fun workout that you'll look forward to doing on a regular basis, I can't recommend this video for you. Just trying to perfect the correct form is a challenge and if you're the least bit uncoordinated you're going to have to rewind a couple of times. It is good for beginners because most of the tape is concern with teaching you the basic moves. Once she puts them all together, the combination workout isn't that hard. It certainly motivates you to become a better kickboxer, but it rates low on the fun meter.",1212969600,13,804,4.33112582781457

That said, I was surprised to find myself really sweating with this workout. It's not one of those jumpy-jiggly videos where you pretend to jumprope and all that jazz. It's low impact, but you'll be so surprised at how sore your core is the next day.

Some may find the instructor's incessant talking a little annoying, but I find it useful in keeping my form in check. Perhaps when I do the workout more it'll start to get annoying, but not yet.

I have found that my form has improved with my gym workouts and overall I am using my core more often in other exercises.

Yes, I got sweaty and burned calories, yadda-yadda...
But the incessent pycho-babble from Patricia Moreno is exactly why I DON'T go to fitness classes and like to work-out at home.  The most irratating part, is that you don't have to listen to her telling you to give a 100% once, but over and over again throughout the DVD.  And then each time you watch it too.  She just seemed way to full of herself.  I mean the workout gets you sweaty, but it's not that hard.  I have an extensive fitness and dance background, so being talked to like I don't know how to punch eight times in a row is unsettling.

I love doing workout DVD's.  If I had know she was going to spout all the inspirational annoyances throught this one, I would not have purchased it.

However, if you have an IQ over 10, you can do like I did, turn down the volume and put some groovy tunes on and avoid watching her flapping lips!!!",1210896000,8,980,4.2032085561497325
3036174,4,B000YV1L6M,"This DVD is really great in a lot of ways, and has many of the things you want from a workout video - beautiful location, great music (much of it a sort of bombay/hiphop/groove), good instruction that emphasizes correct form, well-chaptered, etc.

The only problem (and it's the same problem I have with a lot of these newer Gaiam DVDs) is that there's not really much attention paid to modification, or to people who might have issues like old knee injuries. While there's a lot of kickboxing workouts that are perfectly compatible with a relatively low-impact workout that is safe for your joints (especially your knees), this isn't one of them. There is a ton of twisting, all done in a semi squat position, which is very hard on the knees, and a lot of twisting to full stop, without any guidance on modification, etc.

If you don't have any joint problems I'd say you can probably do this workout and really enjoy it - it is a challenge and a good workout. If you have any knee problems or joint issues, I'd suggest try-before-you-buy if you can.",1210636800,61,1051,4.585106382978723

Well, fast forward about 3 minutes, and I realized that this would be a great workout journey!

My heart rate monitor indicated that I was between 55% and 85% of my maximal heart rate throughout at least 80% of the workout!

The instructor keeps you focused on your posture and core throughout the entire workout.  The moves are different than the standard jabs, crosses, round, side and front kicks.  I particularly liked the 'janga' move which was actually a curtsy lunge with a block.  She then incorporates this move with a kick.  Cueing is good.  The reason I gave it a 4 is because I did not like the constant talking.  I had to really focus to shut her out as it was non-stop (the same comments over and over) and became irritating.

3270624,4,B000YV1L6M,"Most workout videos are extremely patronizing.  When they speak, they think they are motivating you, but instead they address you as if you were an idiot, a child, or both.  It's insulting and patronizing, silly and fake.

Patricia has a way of speaking and presenting herself that she comes across confident, serious, yet motivating.  She let's you know and makes you feel like you came here to work, and that it's going to take some time, but that you will make it.  Sheputs you at ease but asks of you to put in the work.  The backgrounds a soothing, the music challenging and focus instead of loud and distracting.  In short: she speaks to you, not shouts at you.

This is a low-intensity workout.  Her marketers (greedy and deceiving as marketers usually are) advertise this product as any other workout series is advertised: hard, complete, challenging, promising the world and olympic results.  The truth is that this is an alternative (or at the very least, different) workout; it's easy, low impact, although you can mnake it harder by doing the moves bigger, faster, and harder.  Just don't expect a complicated workout.  This is for beginners or for people very out of shape.  I just wish they would advertise it as such, since I believe there is an untapped market of out-of-shape people that are intimidated by workout products they feel are too advanced or out-of-reach for them, and this would be a great alternative for them.  I also wish there were more advanced workouts that would implement Patricia's approach: not patronizing, not condescending, but genuine, confident, focused, challenging, and still entertaining.",1363392000,5,1636,4.988929889298893

I think she does a great job of letting you know which muscles the move is intended to focus on, and continually reminds you to relax your neck and tighten your abs which I appreciate.  Just a few negatives for me:
-The music is a bit odd.  It is some type of tribal/dance blend which doesn't always keep a constant beat.  That makes it difficult to count on your own but instead forces you to look at the screen when you otherwise might not.
-I would not consider this DVD to contain ""(4) separate 20 minute workouts"" or whatever the description claims.  The menu options on the DVD really just allow you to skip to different places in 1 full workout.  So the first and last 20 minute segments contain warmup and cool down, as well as less strenuous exercises while your body warms up.

I recently read the reviews to see if I could get another recommendation for any other workout dvds in this category and decided I needed to review it for others. This dvd will make you sweat without leaving your house. It works muscles that you might not if you do treadmill and eliptical and swimming. It does get you sweating without overworking your feet and knees. She's not annoying, just encouraging. There are just a couple of 'glitches' but who can do an hour of workout without messing up just a little. The people in the background are ok, the setting is nice. It moves along well, teaching you moves and then building on them. The first session does not say 'warmup' but thats basically what it is. It then takes you into the boxing part, the third session is kicking and the last session combines all moves and goes into a cooldown. If you do the whole dvd it takes about an hour. This is exactly what I was looking for, a good workout, sweat, working different muscles, makes the time fly, is more than 20-30 minutes, the people are not annoying and I can do it in my house when I don't feel like leaving it (bad weather).

3270641,4,B000YV1L6M,"We have tried a few other kickboxing DVDs and this is the one we liked.  Honestly, none of these ""kickboxing"" exercise DVDs really teach you how to do kickboxing.  It's more like the instructor strung up a series of kickboxing moves to create a workout for you to break a sweat.

I actually like the instructor, she's pretty clear about what she wants you to do next.  Her cues are not perfect but compared to some other kickbox instructors I gave her 4 out of 5 stars.  My husband is the most uncoordinated person and he usually has a hard time with exercise DVDs.  He actually likes Moreno and he can follow all the punches and part of the kicks even on day one.

Some people complain Moreno talked too much and there were too many talking breaks.  Personally I think it's a good thing for people without a lot of kicking and punching experience.  In order to punch and kick correctly (without hurting yourself) one must learn how to create a solid base and to utilize the core.  Trying to keep up with all the combinations is challenging enough for beginners, let alone keeping properly body position.  Moreno's constant cues remind me to keep my core engaged for a proper and injury-free workout.

The first time I did this workout I spent a lot of time trying to figure out the moves so I didn't break a sweat.  The second time I did it I was able to keep up with the combination and I really sweated this time.  So if you have tried it once and it didn't seem to be a good workout, don't give up on it just yet.

I do have a minor complaint about this DVD.  There are four parts of this exercise DVD: Punches, Core Energizer, Kicks, and Combination.  The first time I viewed this DVD I couldn't get Punches and Core Energizer to play.  When I tried ""play all"" it went straight to the Kicks part then continued on to Combination.  I tried clicking on the ""Punches"" part directly but it kept taking me back to the main menu screen.  I really thought I had a defective DVD and that we're missing two out of four parts.  But on the third day I made another attempt and this time the Punches began to play.  As of today, the scene selection is still unreliable but at least now I know if I keep clicking on Punches it will eventually play.  I like long workout and I wish the combination was a bit longer. I have already learned all the punches and kicks, I would like to go straight to Combination for a good workout  But the combination part is very short.  It felt like that I have just gotten into the rhythm then the workout was over.",1332892800,,2540,4.30801687763713

It doesn't really cut it as a cardio work out, as most of the segments are too slow with too much down time in between each series of combinations while the instructor demonstrates what you will be doing.  It doesn't really cut it as a toning workout, either, as there really is not much in the way of resistance.  It won't work as a beginner's workout, because many of the moves/combinations are too difficult (and possibly dangerous) to be done by someone who has never worked out before.

The set is hard to watch, and the dvd does not time the workouts. This is absolutely ridiculous, and its a horribly designed workout. There is no point in doing this tape, you are better off doing a workout where you actually burn some calories and don't waste time slowly repeating the same movements over and over again.

It is strange that there isn't a ""play all"" button for the sections of the workout, but it's really not that big of a deal.

Just way too much explanation that leads to the heart rate coming down too much, and the supposedly inspirational comments I found to be completely cheesy. Kind of bugs me though, because had it been better edited, I would have given it maybe 4 stars. The other issue is that it doesn't really get going until the ""core"" section, so I will just avoid the ""punches"" section completely in future (1st of 4 segments). That said, there are some interesting moves in here, and towards the mid to end it gets much better. I will probably use it in future for light days when I don't feel like doing too much - for a kickboxing routine it's pretty laid back. Not to say you won't get your heart rate up a bit, but just not a ""normal"" kickboxing workout. Would have been good with a music only option. I think people making these DVDs forget that they are going to be used over and over, and this just increases the irritation level of all the unnecessary explanations that you can't easily skip...the moves were mostly straightforward and an intro section would easily cover it for newbies.",1280880000,,1139,4.560975609756097
3270649,1,B000YV1L6M,"I couldn't get into this workout. It was too weird, and I couldn't get my coordination right or something. Might work great for other people, just not this one!",1263168000,4,160,4.551724137931035
3270650,5,B000YV1L6M,I've been kickboxing off and on for years.  I had read the reviews and was hesitant about ordering the kickboxing with Patricia Moreno but I will tell you she's the absolute best!  I had been doing Billy Blanks for years and while he's quite fast and good I found this one to be well cued and effective.  I didn't expect to be sore but first time I was sore for 2 days.  She is repetitive which makes this so effective because you spend a lot of time concentrating on the move and not how fast it can be executed.  Thumbs up all the way!,1251676800,4,537,4.125
3270651,4,B000YV1L6M,"This was my first workout with Patricia Mareno as an instructor, and I have to say that, overall, I am very pleased.  I tried this workout yesterday, and was impressed with how easy the moves were, but how she really keeps the energy going with these simple moves.  There are four main workouts on this DVD, as other reviewers have already explained, and they are all very solid.  Here's the breakdown:

The good:

1) This is a nice cardio workout for the most part.  It is low-impact (no jumping or plyo moves), and it is nice to see a low-impact workout still raise your heart rate effectively.  If you're in reasonable shape, this workout isn't going to make the sweat pour off you, but that doesn't necessarily mean the workout isn't doing what it should.
2) Moves are simple, for the most part, and easy to pick up.
3) The emphasis on the core and how to correctly hold your core was very nice to me, and told me a lot about why I developed some injuries in the past in my lower back.  Instruction on that was very helpful.
4) The instructor takes the time to show you a slower form of the move first, and actually lets you practice the move before she speeds it up.
5) I was feeling this workout all over by the time I went to bed--it really works your entire core, if you listen to her instructions on what to do with your belly, shoulders, etc.  Great workout if you want to confuse those muscles and break out of a routine.

Needs improvement:

1)I did not find her cueing to be as effective as it could have been.  It was better than most instructors, but there were times when I would have appreciated her calling out the moves more often BEFORE they changed.  This would be very helpful for when she is putting together all the individual moves into combos.
2) No modifications were shown for the moves.  With four people behind her, you'd think at least one of them could have been shouted a reminder to show a modified move!
3) Even though this is low-impact, there are some twisting moves that are had on the knees if you have bad knees.  Also, during the first two workouts you're pretty much standing in horse/warrior stance the entire time.  This got a little irritating on my hip joints.

Some minor annoyances:

1) Did ANYONE else find the one guy behind her to look a little disturbing?  His poofy hair kept distracting me, and it looked like he wandered onto the set and they put him in the video.
2) Nowhere on the DVD packaging does it tell you the length of each of the workouts.  (If it's there, someone please tell me where!)  I like to know how long segments are so I can plan my workouts.

Overall, I really liked the workout and the instructor.  I will definitely be putting this workout in my rotation.",1247788800,5,2733,4.389662027833002
3270652,5,B000YV1L6M,"This particular workout has a focus on the core throughout the entire video. The instructor starts with basic movements and then builds on them from there. The workout is challenging, but there are short breaks and it is not so hard that you want to just give up and throw the DVD in the trash. Patricia Moreno is a great instructor; she uses great cuing, is motivating but still with a pleasant demeanor. It was easier for me to get through the workout with this instructor vs. some others I have worked out to. There is a short portion of a core workout with a cool-down at the end. Good video!",1246147200,,596,4.378378378378378
3270653,5,B000YV1L6M,"While I was doing this workout, I kept thinking that I was wasting my time.  It felt too easy & fun to be effective.  But WOW I sure was sore the next day!  And the second day!  It was a lot of fun & the time flew by for me.  I would definitely recommend this dvd for someone new to kickboxing.  It's a great way to learn.",1245369600,,322,3.7313432835820897
3270654,4,B000YV1L6M,"I workout almost every day and am always looking for new workouts, but I'm very picky about buying DVDs because too many workouts get old very fast.  I really liked this workout, although there are some flaws.

PROS:
*  Great cardio workout.  You FEEL it in your thighs and abs before the workout is even over.  Plus, I like that Patricia Moreno emphasizes how to focus on your core.  Too many instructors assume you know this, but it's really good to hear it again so you can get the most out of every exercise/movement.
*  No jumping.  If, like me, your knees, ankles and feet need a break every now and then, but you still want a cardio workout, this is a good one for those days.  I was totally winded at the end my first few times doing it and I'm in pretty good shape.
*  Some people hate this, but I really liked Ms. Moreno's affirmations.  She has a catch phrase, ""if you give 100%, you will improve 100%"" that she repeats, but I liked the reminder that I'm going to get back what I put in.  If you don't need this, or don't like it, I would say just laugh when she says it, or come up with your own quip to think when she says it.
*  Good timing on the moves.  By that I mean, she doesn't do any one movement too much at a time, but comes back to the moves in combination so you feel like you are building up to something.
*  Some people complain that there are no modifications, but she works into each move from a ""base"" move, so you can always fall back to that if it gets too hard for your level.  As a person with bad knees and feet, I didn't find anything too hard, though sometimes I didn't bend as deep as she did, or kept my moves smaller than hers until I was up to that level.
*  The beautiful background (it's filmed outside somewhere in the Southwest US) is really nice.  Look for the cars driving in the background.  I find that humorous and diverting when I'm having tough days =).  The music is also good and not the same old, same old that I've been finding on so many DVDs these days.

CONS:
* My biggest pet peeve with DVDs is when the instructor loses count or is off the music.  It doesn't happen often in this video, but she does go off the music a few times, and in the final run through of the cardio core sequence she skips part of the sequence.
* The DVD for some reason doesn't have a PLAY ALL option, so you have to stop and click on each section when you want to progress.  Also, the cool down is at the end of the Combination section, so you have to play that section and then fast forward through the chapters if you are doing a shorter workout that day.  There is no chapter listing to go there through a menu.

Overall, I think this is a very good workout and something I can do again and again without getting sick of it.  If you can, rent it on Netflix or try it out first to see if you agree.",1244246400,37,2837,4.075812274368231
3270655,4,B000YV1L6M,"This workout is pretty good and effective.  I agree that Ms. Moreno talks a little too much during the video, but if you just try to block her voice out and pay attention to the music you'll do okay.  The workout itself can definitely make you break a sweat, and you can modify moves for intensity levels.  The only thing I would suggest is to be careful of form.  During the kick section, Ms. Moreno has a lot of twisting lunges and kicks that she calls Jenga (sp?) preps and kicks.  I call them curtsy lunges, and they can kill your knees if they are bad to start, so be careful of your form, or just go into a regular lunge rather than a curtsy lunge.",1241136000,,654,4.158730158730159
3270656,5,B000YV1L6M,I recently purchased this DVD after renting it first from our hospital library.  The DVD starts out slowly with Patricia showing you the movements.  It then progresses at a quicker pace to then an intense series of movements. I would agree that this DVD is not for beginners but for the intermediate to advanced levels.  I have been exercising for years and I found this DVD a worthwhile investment to add to my library.,1238630400,,420,4.648648648648648
3270657,3,B000YV1L6M,"I exercise everyday and although I'm not an expert when it comes to kick boxing I do have a little experience, and I found this video very  easy. The pace was to slow 90% of the time causing my heart rate to stay fairly low. The moves are cool, especially when mixed and the bonus workout has a lot of great stretches. Overall, I'd be great if Patricia didn't talk so much and cut straight to the moves.",1237852800,3,403,4.166666666666667
3270658,1,B000YV1L6M,I never received this video. I e-mailed them about it and they never responded. I am very unhappy!!,1237766400,,99,4.555555555555555
3270659,4,B000YV1L6M,"This is a good video for the intermediate-to-advanced exerciser.  I do not recommend it for anyone who has knee problems, back problems, or any abnormality that causes difficulty in balancing.

My advice is to start off doing 1 segment at a time.  Very few people will ever work their way up to doing the whole thing all at once.  I like to do 2 segments at a time, and alternate days with a lower-intensity video.  I like the fact that I can get a good workout without having to use weights or incorporate any other props.  As a point of reference, you should know that I am 32 years old, exercise 5-6 days/week, and am not overweight at all.",1234828800,,643,4.361344537815126
3270660,5,B000YV1L6M,"I have a gadzillion DVDs and this is my favorite. I love kickboxing workouts, and this one actually is good at communicating how to correctly perform kicks and punches. Patricia Moreno is irresistibly motivating, with such a can-do sunniness you actually think it's easier than it is. She is so gorgeously toned, you want to look like her, too. The music is well-chosen, and the location is beautiful, and the workout is really fun. I love that it's divided into several sections so you can customize your workout. If you do them all, you get more than an hour, so it's a really good value. Plus, it's quite strenuous, especially in some sections, so you do get quite a workout. The combos are really fun, but I had to do the tape three or more times before I got them right.",1233360000,,775,4.50354609929078
3270661,5,B000YV1L6M,"As I am always on the lookout for a new workout and instructors to motivate me I had my local library order this for me so I could take it for a test run.  This one is definitely on my wish list now.  Though some could find Patricia's style too chatty, I thought she had the perfect blend of motivation without constantly talking.  She cues the moves well and has good form.  The scenery is beautiful with red rocks in the background, shot in Snow Canyon, Utah.  The music was fitting to the work-out in my opinion and had a good beat.  I have done some Kickbox workouts before and I would say as far as challenging kickbox moves I'd say no, but challenging for my core and working my lower body....absolutely.  If you are looking for an advanced ""kickboxing"" workout though, this may not be what you are looking for.  The emphasis here is on cross training and your core.

The workout has several sections, punches (about 13 minutes),core training (about 25 minutes), kicks (about 18 minutes), Combo/Cooldown (9/5 minutes), and an additional bonus workout (about 14 minutes).

The first time I did the workout I did punches & core training and stretched on my own after (there is no extensive cool down until the last segment of the dvd, so I would recommend extra stretching on your own).  The next day I did kicks, combo and the bonus. At the end of the week I tried all segments together, making an 80 minute plus workout.

I exercise daily, doing a variety of work-outs-Salsa, Aerobic, Tae-Bo, Yoga, Pilates, etc.  and though I thought at first this wouldn't challenge me enough, I found the pace to be aerobic and though the moves weren't hard, the workout definitely kept my heart rate up and worked muscles that I obviously had not recently worked this hard.  I most definitely felt my muscles even after a couple days after that first workout (core, butt, arms, and inner thigh).
One caution is to be careful while doing on carpet where you are pivoting you will need to be mindful of not twisting your knee.

In the bonus section, I would caution if you have wrist problems as this section is primarily variations of yoga's ""plank"" position (looks like the beginning of a push up).  I am very familiar with plank as it is part of my yoga practice, but still felt her variations were challenging and will build strong and shapely arms (Who doesn't want that?).

Overall, an excellent workout.  I would definitely purchase this item and will also be looking to try more of Patricia's dvds in the future.",1226793600,6,2511,4.591928251121076
3270662,5,B000YV1L6M,"Patricia Moreno is a great instructor - she keeps reminding one of the proper form.  I have done kickboxing before and this is a good workout, but it would also be good for beginners.",1221436800,,183,4.382352941176471
3270663,1,B000YV1L6M,"The moves she does feel awkward and like they are bad form.  Patricia is the only one who looks like she knows what she's doing, but she wasn't even in sync with the music, which was very distracting! I'll admit I only did the first 15 minutes of the workout, but it was so bad I didn't want to try anymore. If you want real kickboxing, try Kathy Smith. Much better.",1220918400,5,366,4.154929577464789
3270664,4,B000YV1L6M,"How intense you find this workout will depend a lot on your current fitness level and how hard you prefer to work out.  As a basis for comparison, I am 55, overweight and just getting back into better shape again after a 5-month ""fall off the exercise wagon"" due to a move and an illness.  I have experience with kickboxing workouts and enjoy kickboxing quite a lot.  I prefer moderate workouts most of the time with occasional intense workouts.  For me, as an example, Tae-bo is relatively intense.

I found this workout relatively intense because it uses the large muscle groups so much--there is a lot of lunging, kicking and squatting.  It is not a cardio workout in the traditional sense, but it most definitely had me sweating.  I also found it intense in terms of my knees--and that isn't a good thing (hence 4 stars vs. 5).  There is an incredible amount of foot twisting in this workout and, with older knees and a carpeted surface, that can make for a really punishing workout.  If you're young, you probably won't notice or care.  If you're older or have had knee injuries, you'll probably want to rent this first and give it a try to see whether/how much it bothers you.

Patricia Moreno is a good and inspirational leader (she also has amazing arms and shoulders).  She cues relatively well and does a slow breakdown of some of the more complicated moves before she actually starts doing them at full speed--I liked that a LOT because I get easily frustrated if I can't catch something on the first try.

The workout, which is filmed with a beautiful Utah mountain/canyon backdrop, includes four main segments plus a bonus power workout:

Punches:  Concentrates on punching (upper body) but still uses the lower body.

Core Energizer:  Focuses on your core, but still features both the upper and lower body with punching and squatting.  Even though this segment is focused on the core, it is all done standing (i.e., not traditional crunches and such).

Kicks:  Concentrates on kicking (lower body).  Having done a LOT of kickboxing workouts, I appreciated Patricia's method of teaching kicks.  She does a good job of giving you a foundation for kicking.

Combinations:  In this segment, you take what you've learned and put it all together--punching and kicking at the same time while keeping your core engaged.

Bonus Power Workout:  I haven't tried this one yet.  I'd read a review that said it was tough.  I watched it and thought ""Yikes!""  This workout is on the mat and features some positions that I'm pretty sure I couldn't get into. :)  I think this is more the territory of the advanced exercisor just from watching it.

I wouldn't say it's the best kickboxing workout I've done, but it is clear that I not only worked hard during the workout but felt it the next day (and sometimes longer).

P.S. Edited to add that I wanted to ditto another reviewer's comment that this workout could have included modifications for beginners or those with knee injuries, etc., but did not.  That is a disappointment.",1219363200,4,3025,4.744721689059501
3270665,2,B000YV1L6M,"Definitely a good beginner workout, but not for the intermediate to advanced. Not challenging, didn't get my heart rate up, too low intesity for me.",1214179200,3,148,4.96
3270666,5,B000YV1L6M,"Patricia Moreno leads this workout and she's really good.  She cues well and is motivating.  I like that it's filmed outdoors instead of an indoor set - I for some reason find that more motivating because I'm thinking of Summer.  It's geared for intermediate to advanced exercisers although the choreography isn't too complicated.
It's a great calorie burning workout that helps increase balance and strength.  If you think about it, you can really feel your core engage while doing this.  The segments start to get harder as the workout goes on, and I admit I found the kickboxing combos a little challenging and took a while to get more comfortable with it.  You'll really feel your muscles the next day for sure.  My favourite part of it all though is the stretch at the end.  It's so relaxing and deserved after finishing this.  I've even done the stretch segment at the end of a day without having done a workout because I find it so relaxing.
Overall, this is a great workout.  It will burn fat and get you fitter.  I really enjoy it and hope you will too.",1213747200,28,1062,4.5661375661375665
3270667,3,B000YV1L6M,"It seems as though most people give the highest ratings to workout videos to the ones that make you feel like you might die when you finish it. I like a challenge as much as the next person, but if you're like me and you basically hate to exercise in the first place and you're looking for a fun workout that you'll look forward to doing on a regular basis, I can't recommend this video for you. Just trying to perfect the correct form is a challenge and if you're the least bit uncoordinated you're going to have to rewind a couple of times. It is good for beginners because most of the tape is concern with teaching you the basic moves. Once she puts them all together, the combination workout isn't that hard. It certainly motivates you to become a better kickboxer, but it rates low on the fun meter.",1212969600,13,804,4.33112582781457

3270669,5,B000YV1L6M,"I have been working out regularly for about 14 years and bought this on a whim. I've been trying to incorporate at-home workouts on the days I can't or don't want to make it to the gym. I consider myself a pretty tough critic of exercise videos/DVDs.

That said, I was surprised to find myself really sweating with this workout. It's not one of those jumpy-jiggly videos where you pretend to jumprope and all that jazz. It's low impact, but you'll be so surprised at how sore your core is the next day.

Some may find the instructor's incessant talking a little annoying, but I find it useful in keeping my form in check. Perhaps when I do the workout more it'll start to get annoying, but not yet.

I have found that my form has improved with my gym workouts and overall I am using my core more often in other exercises.

Highly recommended!",1211932800,15,842,4.412903225806452

Yes, I got sweaty and burned calories, yadda-yadda...
But the incessent pycho-babble from Patricia Moreno is exactly why I DON'T go to fitness classes and like to work-out at home.  The most irratating part, is that you don't have to listen to her telling you to give a 100% once, but over and over again throughout the DVD.  And then each time you watch it too.  She just seemed way to full of herself.  I mean the workout gets you sweaty, but it's not that hard.  I have an extensive fitness and dance background, so being talked to like I don't know how to punch eight times in a row is unsettling.

I love doing workout DVD's.  If I had know she was going to spout all the inspirational annoyances throught this one, I would not have purchased it.

However, if you have an IQ over 10, you can do like I did, turn down the volume and put some groovy tunes on and avoid watching her flapping lips!!!",1210896000,8,980,4.2032085561497325
3270671,4,B000YV1L6M,"This DVD is really great in a lot of ways, and has many of the things you want from a workout video - beautiful location, great music (much of it a sort of bombay/hiphop/groove), good instruction that emphasizes correct form, well-chaptered, etc.

The only problem (and it's the same problem I have with a lot of these newer Gaiam DVDs) is that there's not really much attention paid to modification, or to people who might have issues like old knee injuries. While there's a lot of kickboxing workouts that are perfectly compatible with a relatively low-impact workout that is safe for your joints (especially your knees), this isn't one of them. There is a ton of twisting, all done in a semi squat position, which is very hard on the knees, and a lot of twisting to full stop, without any guidance on modification, etc.

If you don't have any joint problems I'd say you can probably do this workout and really enjoy it - it is a challenge and a good workout. If you have any knee problems or joint issues, I'd suggest try-before-you-buy if you can.",1210636800,61,1051,4.585106382978723

Well, fast forward about 3 minutes, and I realized that this would be a great workout journey!

My heart rate monitor indicated that I was between 55% and 85% of my maximal heart rate throughout at least 80% of the workout!

I particularly liked the 'janga' move which was actually a curtsy lunge with a block.  She then incorporates this move with a kick.  Cueing is good.  The reason I gave it a 4 is because I did not like the constant talking.  I had to really focus to shut her out as it was non-stop (the same comments over and over) and became irritating.

8234258,2,B000YV1L6M,"There are so many ads you HAVE TO  watch at the beginning of this dvd, I rarely use it. My time is limited, yet every time I want to workout, I have to watch all their advertisements because you can't fast forward past them. What were they thinking?

Rather than being able to cross sell me new business, which I'm sure was their intent, they've actually discouraged me from buying anything else from them.",1444348800,3,406,4.472972972972973
8234259,4,B000YV1L6M,"An easy to intermediate workout.  Broken into 4 different workouts.  Just uses arms in first, core in second and legs in third.  Combines the 3 in the fourth workout.  She explains the moves well.  If you are new to kickboxing this would be the workout for you.  If you have done some kickboxing this workout might be a bit basic.  I enjoy the 4th workout but the first three don't excite me.",1435881600,,392,4.361111111111111
