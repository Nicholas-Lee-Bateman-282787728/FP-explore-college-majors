529589,5,6302995957,"My son was in this movie as the 12-year old gun buyer.  He is now 26 years old.  It was truly great working with Forest Whitaker while he directed this film.  A real classic and reminder to all that the hood really exist.  My son and I, especially my son, never experienced growing up in the hood.  We learned so much from this movie.  I remember so clearly when the gun-buying scene was being filmed - real sirens were heard in the background.  It touched me so deeply, for that moment, the scene became real.  In reality, it was real because it happens every day.

Thanks Forest Whitaker for giving us the opportunity to work with you and your talent ""then"" speaks for your success ""today""... Keep up the Good Work!

(By the way, my eight year old son was also in the film but his scene got CUT...smile.)",1189641600,,806,4.348993288590604

529596,4,6302995957,"Forest Whitaker made his directorial debut with this gritty urban tale about a young black male forced to walk both sides of the law. Working as both an informant for an ATF official and as an arms dealer himself, DiQuan Mitchell (played brilliantly by Bokeem Woodbine) is hoping to earn enough money to move out of the projects and gather up enough evidence to get his pregnant crack-dealing girlfriend released from prison. Partnering up with his childhood friend, Bamboo (Onyx's Fredro Starr in one of his first roles), the two try to make their own moves, cutting out Bamboo's original business partner, a white middle-class weapons whole saler named Benny. This erupts into problems on the streets which result in a murder and a number of betrayals in the process.
""Strapped"" plays pretty solidly for a made-for-HBO film. First-time director Whitaker uses a documentary-like atmosphere along with an underutilized cast of actors which includes a number of well-known rappers such as Busta Rhymes and Kool Moe Dee to tell an amazing story. The movie carries a very strong anti-gun message. Spike Lee's ""Clockers"" which followed some months later adopted some of the same themes.",1079481600,3,1182,5.097938144329897
529597,4,6302995957,"Forest Whtaker's directorial debut, Strapped is a gritty action packed drama of a young black man conflicted in his feeling of being loyal to his own or representin' his Housing Projects code of Silence when it comes to  crime. Newcomer Bokeem Woodbine does a good job in his acting debut as  DiQuan Mitchell, The Teen with the conflicted feelings. Rap Star Fredro  Starr is excellent as the Gun Selling,Take no shorts  Character,Bamboo. Excellent Movie with a surprising Climax!! A Must See!!  Michael Biehn is also surprisingly good as Police Officer McCrane. Kia  Goodwin,Jermaine Hopkins,Willie Stiggers Jr. and Rappers Kool Moe Dee,  Monie Love,Busta Rhymes,Das EFX & YoYo also star in this flick. Kudos  also to the Actor who played ""Ben"",the supposedly family Man who  uses his FFL license to purchase guns by mail, then in turn sells them to  the Kids of the Brooklyn Housing Projects...

The story was good for its time, but if I had rated when the movie came out I would have probably given it at least 4-stars. It's just a dated movie now, considering it's 2015.

Rate: 7

3/12: A young black man trapped in the ghetto attempts to go legit yet is caught under an intrigue of bad choices and can't get out...is this getting too typical already? That's what Strapped is all about: beating a dead horse. However, it's still enjoyable as it gets...probably because I am a sucker for Black cinema. Craig Wasson sure has sunk to a new low; he used to be the man in Body Double. Bokeem Woodbine could've been tougher than originally portrayed as. Michael Biehn is great as usual, but his character could have ditched Diquan and sought out for better informants (plenty of them all over NYC). Honesty, the girl isn't worth it; just find another girl and move on. Millions of them out there in the world. All in all, seeing Strapped won't kill you.",1332547200,,788,4.588652482269503

7833335,5,6302995957,"Five Stars all the way on this film. Forrest Whitaker hit it out of the park. This movie still holds its own 25 years after it was released. All of the performances were fantastic--a tribute to Whitaker as he got great depth from first time actors. You would not know from watching this that it was the first time for many of the performers. Bokeem Woodbine is now a mainstay in Hollywood and along with Mekhi Phifer, is a talent to behold. So too was Fredo. This guy was a tough guy supreme.

Now for my quibbles. Contrary to popular belief straw purchases have always been illegal. It's illegal to buy and then provide guns to people knowing they may be used in a crime. When the guy comes out of the store with Bamboo and Diquan and says: ""You didn't do anything illegal."" In fact, they did do something illegal. That goes especially for Ben (Played Phenomenally By Craig Wasson). Gun dealers cannot deal from the hold of their cars. Although the movie is written well enough to not actually have the police witness any direct sales from Ben to his customers, his license would be suspended if he was even suspected in any impropriety. which leads me to another quibble. Veteran gun detectives in New York would not have made an arrest until they had seen Ben make a transaction with someone who was not permitted to have the weapons, which even in New York City circa 1992-1993 would have been illegal. The cops botched everything--including their interrogation of Diquan--which ended up putting his life in danger.

I'd love to see a sequel to this film. Diquan's child is an adult now. I also presume that Diquan would be out of prison by now for his crime. What ever happened to Bamboo? Did he die, survive into the 2000's or get incarcerated himself? I'm the 70th person to review this Five Star film. Buy it and you won't be disappointed.
