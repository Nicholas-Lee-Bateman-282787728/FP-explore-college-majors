5621852,5,B00BHSAV6W,"This DVD series is a fantastic mix of great Bollywood music, fun dance moves and a great cardio workout! For those of you that love dance cardio - this is the best product in the market!",1361232000,6,186,4.194444444444445
5621853,5,B00BHSAV6W,"I've been a fan of Doonya for a long time now so I've been anticipating these DVDs. I must say that Kajal and Priya are two of the most talented people I have ever seen. These lessons are sure to help any and everyone accomplish their fitness goals and have fun doing it too.  As a guy, I was concerned that this may be gender specific but happily surprised when I tried it out and had the time of my life. I'd recommend this to anyone looking to try something new, get in shape and learn a little culture too :)",1361232000,10,512,4.069306930693069
5621854,5,B00BHSAV6W,"I've been waiting a LOOOONG time for the Doonya DVD to come out (it's been almost 3 years since I started begging Priya --co-founder of Doonya and my very first Bollywood dance teacher-- to put one out!) and FINALLY! It's here! Well...almost! I am eagerly awaiting the postman to get here with my copy, which hopefully will be sometime this afternoon.

You may think that it's a bit premature to review a product that I have yet to receive, but I KNOW it's an awesome set of workout DVDs. If you've previewed any of their stuff on YouTube, you can already get a sense of what the energy is like and how easy it is to follow along. Also, I've taken classes in person with both Priya AND Kajal (as well as several other well qualified instructors) and the countless hours of dancing with them have been beyond enjoyable and challenging. The music they choose is always infectiously fun with moves that are easy but effective. It's easy to stay healthy and active with Doonya because it doesn't ever feel like work (even though your body will most definitely feel the burn!)!

I now live in an area where I don't have access to their classes (**hint, hint: Pleeease get some instructors trained in Tennessee, Doonya!!), so I'm psyched to be able to start dancing again Priya and Kajal! Goodness knows, I hate trying to slog through a work out on the treadmill or the elliptical and while Zumba works for a lot of people, it's Doonya that has my heart!",1361232000,15,1448,4.5440613026819925
5621855,3,B00BHSAV6W,It is very fast paced but they break it down into small segments to make it easier for learning.,1430870400,,96,4.105263157894737
5621856,5,B00BHSAV6W,These workout DVD's are awesome and I love the dance moves as well!,1424995200,,67,4.230769230769231

5621859,5,B00BHSAV6W,"I loooooove these DVD work outs. Despite what very few reviews say...they ARE super easy to follow. Don't expect to know every single move the first couple of times you do it, obviously. I have bee. Doing the 2nd DVD (dance routines) 5 days a week for 2 weeks, and after the first week I was able to do it with out the voice instruction and only the music...if you like zumba...you will like this. Totally worth the money.",1421020800,,422,4.3544303797468356
5621860,5,B00BHSAV6W,Great tapes and fun to use.  I would recommend to anyone who loves to dance and excerise at the same time.,1420848000,,106,4.0476190476190474
5621861,5,B00BHSAV6W,This is a fun dance workout that always has me sweating by the end.  Good for days when you just want to move around and have fun.,1420329600,,130,3.814814814814815

5621863,5,B00BHSAV6W,"Very motivating! Even better than I expected. The delivery was a bit slow though and the box was damaged, however, the item itself arrived undamaged.",1419292800,,149,5.0
5621864,5,B00BHSAV6W,This is a fun work out routine and the production quality is great. Each dvd has it's own spin so you get a different experience with each one. The cardio one is my favorite because of its the one with the largest selection of songs to dance to. It's not hard to pick up even for a dance beginner like me. Each video is broken into sections and starts with a warm up and ends with a cool down. There is a music only option too once you have the moves down.,1417392000,,456,3.967391304347826
5621868,5,B00BHSAV6W,A great workout series that is fun and will make you sweat!,1417305600,,59,4.0
5621869,1,B00BHSAV6W,"Too fast, too hard and ridiculous with the moves for beginners.",1417219200,,63,4.818181818181818
5621870,5,B00BHSAV6W,"My neighbor and I have been working out to this about 5 days a week for over a month now.  We both love it.

First, the two leaders, whom we call Priya and not-Priya because only one name gets mentioned, have delightful personalities.  So many workout leaders get very annoying after just a few viewings; these two have no annoying traits at all.  We spend a LOT of time with them, so that alone is worth 5 stars.

Second, even after over a month of trying to follow along, we are still challenged to do all of the workouts on Disc 2.  We are both old enough to be their grandmothers, and neither of us has ever been fit, so I suppose that is understandable.  Nevertheless, we are getting a solid workout even though we are only up to completing about 80% of the steps.  The critical point, though, is that we have fun trying and are improving by the day.

Third, since the most important part of any successful exercise routine is actually doing it, the fact that we're still having fun doing this workout after all of this time despite our challenges speaks volumes for how great this DVD set is.  We ditched Wii after 3 sessions.  We ditched a competing Bollywood disc after 1 session.  Zumba lasted 1 session.  We estimate we've done this one about 25 times and we have no plans to quit.",1403049600,5,1291,4.373949579831932
5621871,5,B00BHSAV6W,Very clear instructions on exercises.  Music is fun.  The dance is an added benefit.  I would recommend this video to everyone.,1402444800,,127,4.9523809523809526
5621872,4,B00BHSAV6W,"Easy moves, short intervals, great instructions. With a baby, its hard taking out time to do a full workout. The short intervals gave me a chance to complete excercises at different times. I love bollywood dancing and after having my baby, I used this dvd to workout. I still haven't lost all my baby weight, but I can feel my abdomen getting stronger already!! Thanks Doonya!",1401840000,2,376,4.712121212121212
5621873,5,B00BHSAV6W,"I ran across this bollywood workout by accident while searching for something else.  I tried the sample videos these ladies have on youtube and found it much easier for me than Zumba.  So, I ordered this three dvd set and love it.",1400544000,,230,4.4523809523809526
5621874,5,B00BHSAV6W,Having lots of fun with this excellent presentation of one of the hardest types of dance to learn.  Would recommend to anyone who loves dancing and getting the best workout for the money.,1400112000,,187,4.666666666666667
5621875,2,B00BHSAV6W,"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers here. While I do love everything Bollywood, the music, the dancing, the movies, etc., this workout is just too difficult. I wanted so badly to love this DVD set, it looked like so much fun, but speed & coordination aren't what they used to be. *Sigh*....
 I started with Hemalayaa videos a few years ago and love them and wanted to expand my workout library. This DVD set looked promising and appeared to have actual Bollywood dance steps but I felt like such a clutz, tripping all over the place. It was embarrassing. I tried to follow the dancer who appears on the left side of the screen doing more modified steps, but she was constantly being cut out of the frame, entirely or sometimes only an arm or leg was visible. It was frustrating & disappointing. I finally just gave up. I'm sure these videos give an awesome workout, both for cardio and toning but I just couldn't keep up or get the hang of the routines. I wish I could return them but it's too late and the amount amazon offers for a trade-in is so small it isn't worth the effort to pack and ship them.
Recently I started using another video which gives me a great workout. It's an exercise/fitness routine that has both Belly Dance & Bollywood ""inspired"" movements. It's a lot of fun, has an easy step guide tutorial, & the steps are much easier to learn. The workout makes me sweat & my muscles really feel worked the next day.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dance-Off-the-Inches-Belly-Dance/dp/B0051MKNKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dance Off the Inches: Belly Dance</a>",1399852800,2,1630,4.927272727272728
5621876,5,B00BHSAV6W,"Contemporary songs. Short segments so you can work as long as you like, then go to the cool down. I am not a dancer, nor particularly fit, but I love this workout and so does my 14 year old daughter!",1399680000,,199,4.0
5621877,2,B00BHSAV6W,"I am not very coordinated but have been able to do some dance type workout videos if they are made for beginners.  So I bought this with the plan of starting on the beginner video and working my way up from there.  Unfortunately, this beginner video isn't like most.  I expected simple dance moves, slowly at first and then building up from there.  They show you a dance move a couple of times and then go on to talk about the next dance move and the history of the dance.  So there is a lot of stop and start in this video.  If I were a coordinated person, it would probably be a great video.  It just didn't work for me.  Unfortunately, I chose to return this video and Amazon charges over 50% restocking fee.  (100% my fault for not reading the fine print somewhere) I have returned other items to Amazon and understand the shipping fee and possibly even a small restocking fee but I will get $14.73 back on this video and I only opened 1 of the 3 cases.  I will not be purchasing any videos from Amazon again.",1395705600,,1013,4.229166666666667
5621878,5,B00BHSAV6W,"Needed something to shake up my at-home exercise routine and this DVD set has been great!  Even though I've done Zumba for years, I find the Doonya choreography to be physically & mentally challenging, which makes it fun & interesting so my exercise time goes by very quickly... Yes, they do a fair amount of explaining, but as a Bollywood beginner, I appreciated their breakdowns of the key moves and background info on the song meanings, etc.  I find the dances more enjoyable when I know what the lyrics mean and how the gestures fit the song.

I'm over 60 and have a knee replacement, so I don't do anything high impact, but these DVDs still provide an excellent workout with lots of variety in the muscle groups used.  Love the music and the Bollywood flavor that Priya & Kajal have given these routines... hope they'll continue to produce DVDs and expand their class locations (it'd be wonderful to attend a live class someday)!

VERY happy with my decision to get this DVD set - there are just a few things that could be better:
1) none of the DVDs would play on my laptop (a Mac), simply wouldn't load at all; fortunately all work fine with a DVD player
2) the leaders tend to cue the moves AS they occur, so there's no warning when a change is coming; I'm sure I'll eventually learn the routines well enough to know what's next, but for now the transitions often feel abrupt
3) the girl showing low-impact modifications is often off-screen (sometimes the low-impact move is described verbally, which helps)
4) it would be nice to have a different warm-up and cool-down routine on each DVD",1395619200,,1597,4.589473684210526
5621879,4,B00BHSAV6W,DVD 2 and 3 are really worth especially for abs and glutes:) Really enjoyed the workout. I would rate it is as moderately intense and anybody can do it.,1395360000,,152,4.275862068965517
5621880,5,B00BHSAV6W,"Love the energy, music, and the clarity with which the ladies speak. Just lots of fun and for the most part, easy to follow. Some of the moves take practice but still a lot of fun.",1395187200,,180,4.027777777777778
5621881,5,B00BHSAV6W,"This workout shouldnt be considered a ""workout"" but rather a time to de-stress, sweat, and have fun! It was really easy to pick up, and fun to keep going. You have the option to switch it up now and then, and thats what i love about it. The music very uplifting, and the instructors always have an encouraging and light-hearted smile.",1394755200,,334,4.491803278688525
5621882,4,B00BHSAV6W,"Fun workout! Lots of talking but really fun if you play the routines in the ""music only"" mode. Music is catchy and there's Ben a great legs and arm workout!",1392854400,,156,4.233333333333333
5621883,2,B00BHSAV6W,"I was very excited to try this work out. I tried many times but I just couldn't follow the moves. Before I could finish one move, they instructors were already on to the next one. It is very upbeat though. Maybe if I was already in better shape to begin with I would have been able to follow it better, or maybe I just do not have the rhythm I think I do. For those that can really dance I think you would enjoy this, but for a beginner like myself it was just too hard.",1391990400,,470,3.90625
5621884,5,B00BHSAV6W,These work outs are so much fun and really work...I love it...the music is great and the dance are challenging but easy to follow...I love the option to workout with just the music...so you can realy get your bolly on....wish they had more dvds...I was sweating like crazy with in the first 10min...its awesome...you don't want to stop doing it.,1391904000,,345,4.766666666666667
5621885,5,B00BHSAV6W,"I have tried many dance work outs in the past. Doonya is one of the best for cardio and muscle toning.  The music is great!  It is a great work out, Bollywood style.  I would recommend to all my friends.

5621886,1,B00BHSAV6W,"I bought this DVD because of good reviews but i am warning you, DO NOT PURCHASE.  They do more talking then performing.  I could not believe it..  WASTE OF MONEY..........  I thought i was going to get a decent work out and along with that I also thought that they were going to do Bollywood dancing but instead these 2 girls just talk, talk, and talk throught out the DVD.  DO NOT PURCHASE",1389398400,2,390,4.287671232876712
5621887,5,B00BHSAV6W,Who doesn't love a workout where it doesn't feel a like a workout because you are having too much fun?!  I do!  The music just keeps you pumping and moving.  Would definitely recommend this to the people that don't like hitting the gym.  You will definitely feel the workout soreness the next day.,1388880000,,297,4.547169811320755
5621888,2,B00BHSAV6W,"I was surprise that there weren't a real DVD cover. DVD's covered with a cartoon, and hard to take the DVD's out. I replace with a cd cover.",1388620800,,140,4.035714285714286
5621889,4,B00BHSAV6W,Love the dance steps! They break it down for you where you feel comfortable enough to do the moves. Better than going to the gym and making yourself look like a fool!,1387411200,3,166,4.21875
5621890,5,B00BHSAV6W,"I just loved this 3 disc set, especially the express workouts!!! I love how the instructors don't seem fake and seem to actually be enjoying themselves. I noticed in some other types of workout discs the instructors are sometimes just too corny and annoying...Not So in this set! I used to hate to exercise and now I look forward to it. The songs are great and I've actually purchased a few of them to listen to. If you hate to exercise I would recommend you try this out. I was really discouraged the 1st time I tried it because I couldn't get a hang of the moves, yet after a few times of doing the moves you do get the hang of it. It's just too bad there aren't More Doonya dvds. I also have tried Zumba and I just didn't like it since the instructors just seemed to try too hard to be funny or witty and I didn't like the dances in Zumba so I thought I just wouldn't like dance dvds..yet I'm so glad I tried this set...SO WORTH IT!",1387152000,3,935,4.114754098360656
5621891,5,B00BHSAV6W,"I am so thrilled!!! My order arrived on time, it is everything I wish for. I'm a huge fan of Bollywood dances and workouts. And I sincerely recommend Doonya to everybody, Priya & Kajol never failed to break a sweat out of me; so please don't hesitate to purchase this order today!",1386806400,,280,4.403846153846154
5621892,5,B00BHSAV6W,"This happy up beat workout, and high tempo music combo make you want to work out and helps you to get threw it. Easy to fallow and positive instruction make it easy to learn. My only down side would be that they stop in between routines and even with the cardio, conditioning cobined, they stop between songs, I march in place or repeat steps to keep my heart rate up for the pause, not a long one but a challenge non the less at times. But well worth the time and effort. Really feeling the workout and parts I am working after only a week. I wish they would come out with a work out that did not stop for at least a half hour routine. Other then that it rocks.",1385596800,,662,4.061068702290076
5621893,3,B00BHSAV6W,"I'm struggling just learning the beginner moves, they go way too fast.  Why can't one person face the way I would face watching it, too hard to do the opposite.",1385164800,2,160,4.333333333333333
5621894,5,B00BHSAV6W,"I teach fitness classes and wanted some new styles to shake things up a bit.  I cannot wait to teach this!!!  The instructors are so fun, clean, and happy that you can't help but like them.  The moves are fun to learn and really work you well when performed right.  I want to tell everyone I know about this product!  Moves fast, so you have to really pay attention, but I loved that!
P.S.  I just found out you can attend a training to become a licensed Doonya instructor.  Going to look into that...",1383609600,,501,4.26595744680851

5621896,5,B00BHSAV6W,"I liked the DVD , especially because it broke down the steps in one of the DVD  and you are able to follow the steps in order to enjoy the dance moves.  I also liked they way you separated the abs , cardios and core strengthening exercises. I did not enjoy the music a 100 %. but overall it was excellent.",1382572800,,305,3.9836065573770494
5621897,5,B00BHSAV6W,"The DVDs didn't come in plastic cases, but rather three cardboard holders.  That's fine with me.
I love this set.  First DVD gave me some basics about the types of Bollywood dances and helped me get familiar.  The second one had a warm-up, a refresher, and then about 11 different dance routines.  It's great because the routines are very short.  Less than 3 minutes.  So you can break them up.  You can play them all in order.  Or individually select them.  You can also choose to do them with or without the instructions.  Then there's an ab/glut workout on the third DVD.  Some of it is typical grinding, repetitive moves like planks, but it's still got dance and it's fun.  And it's also broken up for each body part and that makes it easier for me.
The two girls are great.  So much energy and they're sincerely enjoying it.  Moves and dances are creative.  Some are difficult for me, but I'm getting better and better.  The music is also nice too.  Very upbeat.
One thing that disappointed me was that they cut off the girl who was doing the modified dance moves.  They tell you to follow what she's doing, but the camera completely cuts her off because she's too far to the left.",1380067200,,1186,4.462616822429907
5621898,4,B00BHSAV6W,"I enjoyed this workout DVD.  If you like to dance, this is great!  It was something different.  There was a great introduction the different dance moves before you start.",1379289600,,170,4.793103448275862
5621899,5,B00BHSAV6W,"This truly is a unique fun workout! If you get bored doing repetitions this is the workout for you!  Every dance is different and it is SO MUCH FUN!  The first DVD shows you all the moves so you can succeed at the other two workouts. The set is a great price for everything that comes with it. I have paid much more for programs that did not offer near as much!  The music is great, the instructors are great, and each dance is a different level, so if you cannot do one you can move to another one and work up to a harder one.  If you are looking for a fun, fresh, active workout you will love Doonya!",1378771200,,602,3.9916666666666667
5621900,4,B00BHSAV6W,"This is definitely a tough workout! If you are over 35, you better be in good shape or you will be overwhelmed with their aerobic workouts. I workout almost every day alternating  between strength training and aerobics, BUT I'm nearly 60 and find this very challenging. Since I work full time I am also limited as to how much time I am able to devote to exercise! None of the workouts are under 45 minutes. I relegate this to ""weekend warrior"" status which makes it difficult to learn the dance - my muscle memory isn't what it used to be!

Otherwise-it's a very different kind of workout, the music is fun, and I DO recommend it - just keep in mind your age and fitness level limitations - you will definitely be challenged!",1377302400,,725,4.443609022556391

This video did not have a spiritual element....It's a high impact aerobics video.  I found the teachers to be slightly annoying and way the videos are structured is not a smooth as some.  The segments should be set up as a matrix.",1374796800,2,475,4.962025316455696

5621904,5,B00BHSAV6W,"This set of DVDs is very professionally made.  The instructions are clear and precise.  The music is great, the instructors seem friendly and break down all moves.  Not all Bollywood moves are easy, however, the rhythm of the music keeps your toes tapping.  Enjoying doing the Bollywood dance series as much as I enjoy doing the Zumba fitness DVDs.  I am new to dance so neither of them have been easy but they keep me moving which is what we want.  I am a little 'dance' challenged and have ""two left feet"" and yet I want to get back to doing the Doonya series and much as the Zumba ones.  The difference between the two, there is a lot of arm and shoulder work along with lower body in the Doonya series due to all the Bhangra moves.  It certainly brings the heart rate up.",1373068800,,775,4.296551724137931
5621905,5,B00BHSAV6W,"I worked out TO THE MAX with these DVDs.  This is like the Bollywood version of Zumba.  I am hooked.  The only problem is my mom and sister keep stealing them so now I have combat AND dance workouts every other day.  Good stuff, would buy again.",1372982400,,245,4.148936170212766

5621907,5,B00BHSAV6W,"I'm almost 60 and have some knee issues. My favorite videos for an aerobic workout are Zumba, Core Rhythms, R.Simmons Sweatin to the Oldies, Turbo Jam, Jane Fonda's older videos, and some Kathy Smith. I love Doonya. I love to dance, but don't catch on quite as fast as some people. The Doonya instruction is very comprehensive, and there's a music option only if you don't like instruction. They have one exerciser doing a modified version which I couldn't always see on the video, but I listened to my body (the knees speak loud and clear) and turns out when they did show her I was doing it the way she was. My only complaint is that and having to fast forward part of the warm-up...The instructors and the music more than makeup for those negatives, so I give it five stars. The choregraphy isn't too complex to be confusing, but challenging enough so its not boring. It really is FUN and I was sweating even though I did a low impact version. I'm a teacher and I appreciate the instruction; the girls are friendly and the instruction is very comprehensive. I was 40lbs. overweight, but since I got back into working out I have lost 15 lbs.

No matter, how tired I am, the moment I put on the workout, and hear the music, my feet start to move and before I know, I have completed the workout. I rarely do reviews, but I had to support the crew and also for selfish reasons so they will keep producing such fun and challenging workouts.
My only complaint is the dancer doing easier move is standing to the side, so it is not always easy to follow her.",1370390400,,519,4.2
5621909,5,B00BHSAV6W,"Doonya is the funnest workout I've ever done.  It feels more like dancing, so it's a workout in disguise.

It's a lot easier to work out to songs that I know and like and usually that's the reason I don't stick to a DVD, because I don't know the music or it's boring music.  Everything is very easy to understand and fun to do.  The first DVD explains everything so you don't have to keep going through the explanations each and every time (happened on another DVD and it's a pain to have to keep fast forwarding) the 2nd and 3rd have enough variety to keep me interested and give me 2 options so I can alternate and keep it interesting.

5621911,5,B00BHSAV6W,"I've been trying to find a good Bollywood style workout dvd for quite some time. I tried a lot of them from Hemalayaa's Bollywodo workout to Bollyrobics. Therefore, I turned to Zumba. For those who know me, I am a huuuge Zumba fan because I enjoy having fun dancing and workint out so since then, my bestie got me into Zumba. I'm not a great dancer but I love to watch it.

Thanks to Jeannie on Twitter who told me about Doonya. I've been hearing for some time but had no chance to actually see how Doonya is since the classes are mainly offered in NY. I was stoked to find out that Doonya is now available on a three DVD series. I immediately bought it but because of my work schedule, I wasn't able to try the workout until recently.

I've gone through all three DVDs and I have to say I absolutely love it. I already get excited when some Zumba teachers uses Bhangra or Bollywood songs in their workout. But to have a full workout just doing that??? I grew up watching Bollywood so to actually learn how to do some moves and work up a sweat is exciting. I love the intros to the dance steps and the variations of music and got super excited when I knew most of the songs already. I cannot wait to share with my other Zumba-fanatics too.

I want Doonya in Atlanta asap please.",1368921600,2,1278,4.229508196721311

The menus give you options to listen to instructions or just music only , and give you the song list, and tell you what part(s) of body you are working!
The filming is beautiful and the sound quality is superb!
The pace of teaching is perfect.
Great breakdown + quick reviews of steps.
Warm-up and cool-down is perfect length.
You definitely get your money's worth with MANY songs on each DVD!
Different styles are taught (Bollywood, Bhangra, Classical, Village)
The girls infuse their fitness training and use proper techniques
Songs are fun, catchy, popular!

This DVD set is worth $60+ in my opinion!",1368316800,,838,4.543046357615894
5621913,5,B00BHSAV6W,"So I completed the Insanity program a few months ago and am constantly looking for challenging workouts on DVDs. I love to dance and I love to sweat: Doonya is it for me! I had never tried Bollywood dance before and at first I found some of the moves challenging, but now I'm getting better. Plus, the music is just great. Honestly I sometimes dance to the same song twice in a row because I just love its music.

The claim is that you'll burn at least 600 calories in an hour and I think it's true. I'm always drenched in sweat when I'm done. Overall, I really love Doonya  because it makes my legs/thighs burn, and being pear-shaped, that's the one area I've been having trouble reaching. My favorite is DVD 2, but DVD 3 also provides a good workout. DVD 1 teaches the moves; after that, you probably won't ever watch it again. But getting 3 DVDs for under $25 is a great value to me.",1367798400,,886,4.267857142857143
5621914,5,B00BHSAV6W,"I love love love this workout. I got it a few days ago, was a tiny bit reluctant at first that it would give me a ""true"" workout after having tried out other bollywood workouts. Boy was I pleasantly surprised!!!
Firstly, THE MUSIC is awesome!! All my favorite songs and I mean all. Everytime a song came on it was OMG I love this song! Secondly, the moves...pure bollywood moves which give you a great workout and make you feel like a bollywood diva. And it makes you work....in the most fun way possible! I laughed at the description. Thirdly, both Kajal and Priya are great! They ooze positivity! They smile through it all which is so encouraging. They don't shout at you, they encourage you to be your best!

I bought this because I am a big bollywood fan and I love dancing but I have weight to lose, and yes I have and I am sure with this high energy party (I refuse to call it a workout, its too much fun!) I am sure I will lose more.
Seriously, these DVD set was such a wonderful surprise, it was much more than I expected. HIGHLY recommended for anyone who loves to dance and wants a fun workout! Absolutely love it!! You will not be disappointed.",1367539200,2,1155,4.298165137614679

I love the variety in all the different Indian dance styles they incorporate - bollywood, bhangra, garba, bharatanatyam, and kathak!
Plus the 'music only' feature is really nice so you don't have to hear all of the instructions/directions after the first time and you can just enjoy the music. If you enjoy dancing at all, you won't even feel like you're working out (although you definitely are!). :)

Bottom line: I would very highly recommend the Doonya Workout to anyone who is looking for some fun, moderately intense, cardio/toning workouts.",1367452800,,723,4.878048780487805
5621916,5,B00BHSAV6W,"I had never heard of Doonya until stumbling across it on amazon when looking for highest rated workouts.  After reading the reviews I decided to give it a try, the preview video made it look like a lot of fun.  I have had the dvds for about a week now and I have done the Cardio Dance and Conditioning dvd twice and the others once so far.  I am a 5'3"" female and 30 years old and in the process of trying to lose some baby weight.  I have about 20-25 lbs left to go so obviously I'm not in the best shape, but I have been doing workouts a few times a week for the last 3 months.  Anyways, since starting these workouts last week and doing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Personal-Training-With-Jackie-Xtreme-Timesaver-Training/dp/B003VQO524/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Personal Training With Jackie: Xtreme Timesaver Training</a>&nbsp;a couple of times, I can tell I'm much stronger and have a little more bounce to my step.  My sides of my abs (obliques) are so much harder than they were and it's easier to squat down and get up than it was before.

I love the instructors.  Their smiles are infectious and they seem like such sweet and caring people.  The workouts are a lot of fun and the music is great. They explain the moves well too. The workouts are a little difficult at times trying to keep up when they're moving faster (especially when you are overweight), but not so bad that it's impossible to do it.  I just go at the speed I'm physically able to do.  And it's supposed to be a challenge, right?  My thinking is that it will get a little easier each time I do it and I will catch on to the moves a little more each time I do it.

Besides it being a little speedy at times, my only complaint is that in the Cardio Dance & Conditioning dvd they say to watch the girl on the far right for modifications, but it rarely shows the girl the entire workout so you pretty much have to guess what the modifications might be.  I really hope that if they make another dvd that they have someone doing modifications that you can watch and follow.

Another good thing is that concentrating on getting the moves right make time pass by faster so you've done a 70 minute workout before you know it.  You don't have to do 70 minutes though.  They have all the workouts broken down into lots of segments with different variations (music only or instructor with music) which is great!

Overall, this is worth the money.  I'm glad I purchased it and I do recommend it.  I will try and follow up in a few more weeks to let you know how I'm liking it and if I've lost anymore weight etc.  :-)",1366934400,2,2629,4.5275423728813555

I love the workout so much that I wish they had more than just 11 songs. They have broken down the steps v nicely and that makes it v v easy to learn and follow.

The problem with the set is the 3rd DVD has the same songs for express and abs workouts, this gets boring if you workout everyday. If they come up with another set, hopefully the songs are better and different in all the DVDs and they have a shuffle option. Also they should not have a recap of steps before each song.(DVD 2)",1366675200,,622,4.098360655737705

5621928,5,B00BHSAV6W,". . . still I'm a sucker for Bollywood dance workouts.  So after a little research, I decided to purchase the 3-disc package--best value for this Doonya uninitiated girl. For visuals of this workout, go to YouTube or the Doonya website.

EQUIPMENT NEEDED:  Only an exercise mat for floor work during the express abs workout.  Other than that, nothing.

FORMAT:  The format of the workouts is pretty ""Zumba-esque,"" for lack of a better expression.  Each ""routine"" is made up of one song.  You use a few moves to make combinations which are repeated throughout one routine.  Next routine, you use a different set of moves to make up a different combo and so on.

DIFFICULTY:  I'd say this workout would mostly benefit beginner to intermediate exercisers.  If you're on your fifth round of Insanity, you might laugh at this one.  Of course, as with all things, what you put into it is what you will get out of it.  I'm an intermediate level and, while I wasn't about to die, I did have a decent sweat going.  You will be sipping water between breaks-have it handy.  There's a LOT of balance work (i.e. supporting yourself on one leg).  If this is not your thing, you have been warned.

THE WORKOUTS:  The same ""Intro to Doonya,"" warm-up (a roll down, chest isolations, squats, lunges, grapevines, hip/knee lifts, and various stretches) and cool-down (flowing side lunges, cat/cow, swan, butterfly, downward dog and other various stretches) are on all of the DVDs.  There's a modifier on the discs 2 and 3 for those who prefer to make things less intense.

DISC 1:  Beginner Breakdown:  This is exactly what it sounds like.  It's a breakdown of Doonya's signature moves.  There are four major influences for the moves:  (1) Bolly-Pop (a fusion of Northern India's hip moves and expressions and Western dances like jazz and hip-hop), (2) Pop Bhangra or ""Phangra"" as it's referred to in the workouts (strong shoulder moves, kicks, and lifts), (3) Regional Village (series of glides and flowing movements) and (4) Classical Conditional (appropriate stance and hand gestures).  There are about 20 or so moves but they're pretty easy to remember since they're all slight variations of each other.

There is also a dance that you can learn.  The dance is broken down into segments and builds into an entire routine that lasts just above 3 minutes.  There's a bonus performance to the same song as well.

OP:  You get to know the moves a bit more accurately since you're learning them at a slower pace.  However, after you've got the moves down and learned the dance, you're likely to never use this disc again.

DISC 2: Cardio Dance and Conditioning:  This DVD consists of 9 full dance routines (Heads up!  One routine has planks and push-ups . . . don't get scared, there's not a lot) and 2 conditioning routines--one for glutes and thighs, the other focuses on shoulders and arms.  On the workout menu, it shows the focus (glutes, legs, core, cardio, etc.) and the song of each routine.  Pretty neat feature.  There's also a separate ""refresher"" of the moves on this DVD.  It's basically the beginner breakdown done at a faster pace.

OP:  The best in the bunch!!  Super fun workout!  Lots of variety and you have a few free-style options so you're not married to the moves.  This one (the third disc as well) also has a music only option, which I love.

DISC 3:  Abs, Glutes, & Cardio:  The final disc has 3 express workouts:  (1) ""Abs"" is a combo of standing abs and floor work: chest isolations, hips lifts, body rolls, sweeps, twists, planks, plank jacks, ""guitars"" (crunches and extensions in a ""C""-curve position), seated rows, and leg pulls in plank.  (2) ""Glutes"" consists of glute lifts (naturally), glides, swings, kicks, taps, lunges, etc.  (3) ""Cardio"" includes 3 routines:  the first and third are mostly knee lifts and kicks and the second routine is all bhangra steps--taps, bhangra basic, and back swings.

OP:  The cardio portion wasn't as fun as disc 2 but still not bad for a quick workout. The abs for me was a bit light.  Suggestion for you all with stronger abs:  lift your feet during the guitars and rows and don't tap your foot during your leg pulls.  This will make your workout a bit more challenging. The saving grace of this disc is ""Glutes.""  Your bum will sizzle but at least you'll have a good time doing it!

INSTRUCTORS:  Priya and Kajal take turns leading each routine so while one leads, the other joins the rest of the group as a background exerciser.  This is very cool since one doesn't talk over the other. They're neither over the top cheerleaders nor dictators; it's like working out with your friends.  They're cueing is not on point all the time but overall, it's pretty good.

PRODUCTION/MUSIC:  The workouts take place in a gorgeous outdoor park setting.  The production and editing was very clear and professionally done.  The music is infectious.  I woke up this morning with it still bopping in my head.  (Yes, that's a good thing.)  Personal favs:  ""Thug Le,""  ""Do Dhaari Talwaar,"" and ""Show Me Your Jalwa.""

JUST A HEADS UPS UP:
*Give this one a couple of tries before casting it off.  The first time I tried this I thought it wasn't that intense but during my second try, I was able to put more into it.  Made a whirl of difference.

*Some of the steps and transitions are kind of tricky when done on carpet.  Make sure that you have footware that allows you to ""glide"" a bit.

*Don't look for the routines to be the exact dance numbers you'll see in the movies.  You're going to be disappointed if you do.

*Quite a few of the routines have these mini-introductions--usually it's an explanation of a new move that's going to be used in that routine--which are helpful during the first couple of times you do them but after that . . . well, you know.  Good looking out on the editor for putting chapters within those routines so you can skip those portions.  Intros cannot be skipped unless you're using the ""Play All"" feature.

*No, your eyes are not deceiving you.  There are actually a few more moves in the refresher than there are on the breakdown.

THINGS I'LL JUST HAVE TO LIVE WITH:
*Have your remote controls ready, ladies and gents--the warm-up and cool-down are separated from the actual workout.  You have to click on the warm-up on the main menu and when it's complete, you scroll down the menu to open up the workout menu.  Once your workout is complete, you have to go back to the main menu to go to the cool-down. (Whhhhhyyyy???!)

*There's a two minute introduction to the warm-up (importance of warming up, proper alignment, etc.) which got old by workout two.  Yes, you can fast forward it but it would have been great to include the skip option so you wouldn't have to try to gauge at what point the actual warm-up is supposed to start.

*While you can choose from individual routines, customization a la the 10 Minute Solution workouts would have been a cool feature for those who wanted that option.  So instead of doing one routine at a time, you would have the option to mix and match without having to keep going back to the remote.

OVERALL:  As crazy as it may sound, I almost counted on being disappointed yet again.  I've had my share of duds but this is without a doubt the best Bollywood workout that I've ever tried.  Looking forward to more!

5621936,5,B00BHSAV6W,"I usually don't buy exercise DVDs because I need to be in front of an instructor or trainer who can push me. But since I've taken Doonya's classes in NYC and enjoyed their workouts, I thought I'd give this a shot. I ordered 2 sets, but only received one. I contacted the seller through Amazon and they got back to me right away and sent me the second set.

First off, it's nice that they shot it in the beautiful outdoors. The setting does make a difference. On the first DVD, we learn the fundamental steps of Indian dance which serve as the foundation for everything else. Kajal and Priya also demonstrate the choreography of a dance step by step. This is good if you want to learn some steps for an Indian wedding or party. For me, the second DVD is the most fun. They offer 11 routines. After just doing the first few routines, I was sweating a lot more than I thought I would. I also like the menu option where I could mix and match routines if I didn't want to do the entire thing. They also have an option to just listen to the song. The third DVD is all about strength and toning. What I like is that their menu tells me which part of the body I'm working on.

Overall, I'm pretty happy with my purchase. It's a fun way to exercise if you don't like running on the treadmill or going to the gym.",1362787200,,1303,4.166666666666667

Since I live too far away to take classes with Doonya, this is the next best thing.  I have purchased so many Bollywood DVD's over the years and not one compares to Doonya's!

5621943,5,B00BHSAV6W,"I've know about Doonya for a long time but there were never classes offered where I lived. I work out to a lot of DVD's because I don't like to go outside super early in the morning when it's freezing not to mention it's a time saver to work out in your home in the mornings before work. I was getting into a rut with my regular DVD's so these couldn't have come at a better time. I've been waiting not so patiently for my Doonya Dvd's to come in. It's a great concept to making working out fun and enjoyable. Don't let the fact that they are dance steps intimidate you because they give you step by step instructions and it's easy to catch on. I promise that you will leave the house with a smile on your face after using these because it really is like having a Dance Party in your home!!

I married into an Indian family, so am familiar with Bollywood dance, but have never done it myself so I REALLY appreciated the breakdown of the steps.

I thought I was in good shape but these women show me that I still have room to grow.  The best part is that I can modify and they are easy to follow. They give excellent instructions and encourage fun, individualism, and overall health and happiness.  The instructors are charismatic and push you without being annoying.  The background dancers all show you in different ways how you can have fun and target the areas you need to focus on.  This isn't just dance (although its a big part) they obviously have an understanding of working the various parts of your body from arms, core, glutes and legs.  They infuse dance, bollywood and fun into exercise and my hour of work turned into what seemed like 20 mins of late night dance parties!  This makes Zumba look like child's play",1362009600,2,907,4.4939024390243905

Since it's sometimes hard to get to a class, this DVD is perfect.

The workouts consist of a variety of the best Bollywood songs. Even if you aren't familiar with Bollywood music, you will love it instantly. The moves are very different obviously, but they are broken down so well during the workout. It's a combination of cardio and toning, and it's pretty intense (in a good way), but because the music and routines are so fun, you won't even notice that an hour has slipped by!

Kajal and Priya are both amazing instructors. I love their styles and the way they break down the moves. I can't wait to keep going to classes and using this DVD while I'm not in class.

From personal experience, I can tell you that you do not need to be a great dancer to LOVE this work out - and you will get better over time! I feel so privileged to have taken so many classes with Priya herself - she is amazing and makes it easy to follow along. The music is SO good - it is sure to get stuck in your head and you will be doonya-ing down the streets like a fabulous Bollywood star!

But am constantly frustrated by how there's just not enough time (or money) in the day!

When I first heard about Doonya Dance, I couldn't believe how many of my pursuits could be found in a single packaged experience. When I first joined a Doonya Fit class at the Chelsea studios in New York, I couldn't believe how deep the experience went - from body to mind to connecting with people with like interests (not to mention my shock to be taught by the absolutely gorgeous co-founder Priya Pandya herself!). So I couldn't believe coming across this new DVD which will mean so many more opportunities to keep taking part in the Doonya experience and to share it with my friends.

Congratulations Doonya team on getting this DVD out! I can't believe how much Doonya is taking off - this is not just the latest new trend in culturally authentic movement and exercise, it's the category definer!

I initially went because I was bored with the monotony of a gym, but I still had to be convinced that these classes would not just be fun, but also show results. After just one hour at the studio I was converted! The classes are super high energy, the moves are fun and easy to learn, and you can feel in your muscles afterwards how it's all very intelligently designed to give you a proper full-body workout.

However, I've been doing some of their short video clips in the safety and solitude of my living room and love them, so I was thrilled to learn that a DVD set was coming out. I've done a lot of different types of workouts, and what I enjoy about Doonya is that I can definitely feel the muscles working, but the fun factor gets me through the workout. It has you really feeling the burn by the end, but since it's so fun and upbeat, you forget you worked out until you feel pleasantly sore the next day. Very sneaky! The movements are more conscious than other cardio videos I've done. Instructors Priya and Kajal break steps down really clearly so you understand what muscle groups should be working, instead of rushing through a cardio routine on sheer momentum or letting yourself cheat.  Even if I'm pressed for time and just do the abs, I'm surprised at how effective it is at toning. They really know what they're doing!

DoonyaFit is a high energy workout that combines the elegance of traditional Bollywood dance techniques with high impact cardio moves.  Unlike other dance workouts, Doonya classes are never repetitive; each Bollywood song is a brand new love story with unique choreography, and I find myself to be acting the part of a Bollywood princess while getting an amazing workout.  Not to mention that my abs, legs and butt are completely sore afterward.  I also love Priya and Kajal's teaching styles - they are so passionate about Bollywood dance and you pick up some of that positive energy just by watching them dance!  I'm pretty sure that I'm not a great dancer but with Doonya I just have so much fun, who cares if I look like a fool!  Anyway, excited that these DVD's finally came out so i can finally share this amazing practice with my friends outside of NYC!",1361232000,23,1012,4.68361581920904

Going to the gym or going for a run suddenly feels drab and even insipid compared to this workout routine so full of soul and sweat. Thank you Doonya.

8568688,4,B00BHSAV6W,Very fun dances! I feel like it is a pretty good workout. I will say that it tells you that you can burn around 500 calories per workout and I don't feel like that's accurate. It's a nice workout but not too vigorous.,1483142400,,217,4.069767441860465

8568695,3,B00BHSAV6W,"As a huge fan of Bollywood films and Hindi culture in general, I wanted to find a video that could teach me the awesome dance moves that I always see in the movies. It's a fun workout and it's great cardio. I have had this series for several weeks and do it every other day and I still get so sweaty doing these. The first dvd to me is the hardest because your learning all the moves. I actually would recommend buying only the 2nd dvd because the 1st and 3rd don't have much on them. I was looking for something a bit more authentic & was looking to learn some actual choreography not just a workout but it's still fun.",1433894400,,620,4.132231404958677
