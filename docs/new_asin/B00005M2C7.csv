1623803,4,B00005M2C7,"This collection would be improved by inclusion of the early Dreyer comedy The Master of The House. I have seen Gertrud and The Day of Wrath in the cinema several times and Gertrud is on my list of all time top ten. The severity minimal means achieving maximum effects are the essence of what director/critic/screenwriter called ""the transcendental style"". The story of a woman's' love that was never requited by those who loved sounds simple enough but then, Dreyer would not be the master he is if he had not turned it into something beautiful that is intrinsically tied to the means of the film as medium itself. I thin that this film has only 57 shots. Yes 57! Long camera takes and static camera setups are what make this particular film and unforgettable experience. Definitely not for all tastes but once you see it you will probably be hooked.",1022284800,6,850,4.673333333333333
1623804,5,B00005M2C7,"The only sad thing about this collection is that it doesn't include Dreyer's working of Jesus' life which, of course, is because he never filmed it or really completed the script. All other work represented is tops. From ""Ordet"", the classic play by fellow Dane Kaj Munk, to ""Gertrud"", this collection is a must have. The documentary shines light on his techniques, approach & brilliance. For some reason Dreyer's not as well known as another director great, Ingmar Bergman, but maybe this collection will help in that regard.
Known mostly for his wonderful interpretation of ""Joan of Arc"" & ""Vampyr"", Dreyer's later work is equally riveting (if not moreso). His understanding of the human condition shines through in each film.
If you have a penchant for Scandinavian film-making, this is a necessary buy. If you just love films, it's well worth your time to decide if it's your cup of tea.
Finally, as for Criterion's working- it's tops, as usual. Their attention to detail evident in each film they persue.",1010448000,,1009,4.9411764705882355
1623805,5,B00005M2C7,"I've been a longtime fan of the films of Dreyer, not only for the profound themes that he portrays in his films, but also for the unusual way he sets and composes his scenes.  Each film I have viewed of his yields remarkably composed still scenes that would stand alone as works of art.  The documentary DVD that accompanies this set is worth the price of the collection.  Not only is it informative, but it is produced with an artistic visual style that perfectly complements its subject matter.",1000252800,9,496,4.613636363636363
1623806,5,B00005M2C7,"I purchased this box set having only previously seen Dreyer's Day of Wrath (and Passion of Joan of Arc, which although not included is available separately on a great disc from Criterion as well) and I had little preconception of Ordet and Gertrud except that they were supposed masterpieces.
Upon watching the 3 films and documentary included, I realize Dreyer's reputation as an intense stylist & perfectionist is well deserved. His films have a reputation for being unbearable to watch, apparently, but I didn't find them to be horrible at all. They do not have much in the way of entertainment value (Ordet contains the sole explicit joke in the 3 films), but aspire to loftier goals.
The films are filled with slow, long tracking shots and feature progressively fewer close-ups. All of the films are exceptionally talky by today's standards, and all feature stunning manipulation of light to suggest emotional states of the characters.
Of the three films, I felt Ordet was the best. The film caught me off guard with its ability to shock me with its beauty and raw emotion. This is probably the best filmic exploration of religion that I have ever seen. The characters are archetypes, to be sure, but the actors embody them with enough emotion that they transcend them. The film has perhaps the most powerful, subtle use of special effects that I have ever seen. I feel this is one of the absolute masterpieces of cinema and am eager to revisit it.
Gertrud is a lesser film than Ordet, though not by much. Like Ordet, the films characters are archetypes, but somehow transcend them. I think these three films are amazingly adept at establishing an ""at the speed of life"" pacing that lulls us into thinking we're watching real people with real concerns as the themes leap into universal territory. Gertrud's character is one of the most interesting pre-feminist women I've seen in cinema and I think Dreyer's refusal to judge her in any way saves the film from being the bore that many find it.
Day of Wrath is probably the simplest of the three films, but it is still a great work. Ironically, it's the film with the most outward action in it, and it has the most outwardly accessible subject matter, so I'm surprised it appealed to me the least. Nonetheless, it's gorgeous, impeccably acted, and has plenty of dramatic heft.
As a viewer of modern film, I notice that these three films bear deep thematic resemblances to the films of cinema's other Great Dane, Lars von Trier. I would be so bold as to call the majority of von Trier's work a homage to Dreyer's oeuvre. Of course, one of his first projects was the realization of Dreyer's unfilmed script for Medea. A few years later, his Europa echoed the theme of Day of Wrath (suspicion of guilt becomes self-fulfilling prophecy). Obviously, Breaking the Waves and Ordet share last-minute religious redemption, but consider the leads of his The Idiots and Dreyer's Gertrud. Both are victims/martyrs of their adherence to an ideal, and that no one in their community can match it... and what is Dancer in the Dark if not a musical celebration of cinema that at the same time evokes Passion of Joan of Arc? I don't feel this reduces either director's films... rather I feel this set of old classics has enabled me to better examine some new ones.
Also, the fourth disc is a somewhat middling documentary that, while cute, seems to focus more on recalling the mannerisms of the director than the intent of his work or the critical reactions to it. The liner notes are excellent. The set as a whole is indispensable.",999648000,75,3569,4.758064516129032
1623807,5,B00005M2C7,"These films are true works of art. If you have any sympathy for the work of Andrei Tarkovsky, or that of Ingmar Bergman, then it is almost certain that you will appreciate Dreyer. Tarkovsky himself praised Dreyer, and his influence is directly discernable in Bergman's films.
*
Ordet is, perhaps, the most shocking of the three. The film dwells upon the spiritual lives of its characters, and it addresses this spiritual plane in several ways - strikingly through madness, through sectarian conflict, and through the mysteries of birth and death. The utter seriousness of its approach (save for a humorous reference to Kierkegaard (believe it or not)) allows the viewer to enter unreservedly into the film's world, which in turn allows for a miraculous climax, that is unbearably moving, itself a miracle of the cinema. So many of the universal elements in human existence are at work here that each viewer will undoubtedly find resonances within his or her own life.
*
Day of Wrath is a disturbing Freudian drama, cloaked in a world of tyrranical religion and witchcraft. Arthur Miller's 'The Crucible' was allegedly influenced by this film. The second wife of an aging cleric, rather precipitiously engages in an affair with her husband's son from his first marriage, all under the stony eye of her fearsome mother-in-law. Self-reproach and resentment abound, and the damning of witches stands as an allegory that is not limited simply to sexuality.
*
The acting in both these films is particularly fine. Dreyer pioneers some cinematographic techniques too, such as the tracking of the camera while reverse panning, and some memorable horizon shots (was Kurosawa in the audience?).
*
Gertrud, while recognisably Dreyer's work, is quite different. Here the nature of time and its role in film is central, and one can she how this film might have been a catalyst for some of Tarkovsky's thoughts. The acting is incredibly stylised, and the tableau as carefully arranged as still lifes. This film is so far removed from ordinary film conventions that it can be hard to relate to - in terms of the viewing experience perhaps there are some similarities to seeing an Antonioni film, but not too many: this film is unique.
*
Criterion have provided their usual superb transfers, and an interesting documentary. Really, the whole production of this package is faultless. A booklet provides a short extract from the book 'Dreyer in Double Reflection: Carl Dreyer's Writings on Film', edited by Donald Skoller, and I can also recommend this book in its entirety. Finally, Dreyer's Passion of Joan of Arc, also on Criterion, is as great as any of these three films.",999216000,24,2657,5.013574660633484
1623808,5,B00005M2C7,"Carl Th. Dreyer is a director in dire need of rediscovery by cineasts and dedicated tv broadcaster alike. DAY OF WRATH and ORDET used to figure frequently on prominent critics 10 BEST FILMS EVER lists ever but lately this Danish auteur seems to have been sidetracked. Now DAY OF WRATH and ORDET are again released in glorious, restored versions. Both utterly compelling films going straight for your brain and throat. These two masterpieces are complimented by Dreyer's last ouevre GERTRUD, a work with which the darling director of the young French New Wave directors managed to split a world of critics into two shouting halves. Also included in the beautiful box is a stunning new documentary. Treat yourself, treat your school, treat your viewers. It's doesn't come better.",998956800,6,777,5.078125
1623809,5,B00005M2C7,"The author of ""La passion de Jeanne D'Arc"" has finally seen from heaven how his five best masterpieces are avaliable for every person in the world. And, of course, it had to be The Criterion Collection who made this possible.
The three works of art (""Gertrud"", ""Ordet"" and ""Vredens dag"") are presented in gorgeus Black and White preserving its original aspect ratio, with good extras and accompained by a magnificent additional disc presenting the documentary ""Carl Th. Dreyer: Min Metier"".
These three Danish films are living beings of film history. They represent the highest level of ""trascendental cinema"" and create a new visual and conceptual world.  The 'mise en scene', composition and character developing reach an unbelievable strength in most of the sequences in this Collection.
I can't finish without suggesting you to buy this magnificent pack as well as the other two Dreyer's films released by Criterion on DVD: ""La passion de Jeanne d'Arc"" and ""Vampyr"". If you do this, the artistic level of your 'DVDtheque' will improve enormusly.",997833600,4,1049,5.170588235294118

7944698,5,B00005M2C7,"Carl Dreyer's cinema is pure and clear as the eyes of Lisbeth Movin in ""Day of wrath"" ,his cinema is profound as  Johannes Borgen speeches in ""Ordet"" and proud as Gertrud Kanning in ""Gertrud"".A truly one of a kind.

7944699,4,B00005M2C7,"I purchased this set to check out ""Ordet"".
The movie is quite theatrical, and a demanding drama which reward concentration.",1265241600,,123,5.2
7944700,5,B00005M2C7,"The fact that Criterion took 3 of the greatest movies ever made, and put them into a box set is truly something to be thankful for.  The few Dreyer films that actually made it onto VHS were always poorly transferred copies.  But their power and artistry still shone through.  Now we have these masterpieces from our friends at Criterion.  My personal favorite is Ordet, which is one of most uplifting, spiritual (NOT RELIGIOUS), and moving films ever made, with a truly stunning final scene.  Gertrud is the 2nd best, with some of the most heartbreaking images and dialogue ever committed to celluloid.  Day of Wrath is a good film, and the first film in which Dreyer's latter day style really took shape.  All three films employ Dreyer's latter day filming style, very long takes, with meticulously composed and lit shots.  The cinematography for these films is utterly gorgeous, especially the later two films.  Gertrud reportedly contained only 57 shots in the entire film (always a good sign), and Ordet only took 5 days to edit (probably a record).  The documentary is good, for the fact that the director frames his shots in interesting ways, as opposed to the usual, televisionesque ways documentaries are handled.  This docu feels cinematic, unlike most modern documentaries which have a TV news feel to them.  There is also a booklet included in this set with marvelous quotes from Dreyer on art, people, cinema, and directing.  It's more informative about the cinematic/artistic process than four years at a film school.  It was rather sad that Dreyer only made 5 features in the last 40 years of his life, but the films he did make were masterpieces.  Despite the long periods in between films (Dreyer only made 5 feature films and a few shorts in the last 40 years of his life), Dreyer never lost his artistry.  Gertrud, which was Dreyer's final film, is from that old man's cinema catalogue, the final film (or close to it) of great directors that is usually slow, doesn't hurry, and is usually very melancholy and sad.  Several examples of this are Kurosawa's Madadayo, Wilder's Fedora, Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut.  This is a box set that is definitely worth having.",1148688000,6,2223,4.8514588859416445
7944701,5,B00005M2C7,"This set gives us a great sampling of Dreyer's style, which might be described as ""neorealism"".  Dreyer felt that his films should be entertaining and not just for artistic analysis, but you have to see them to begin to get a feel for his style.  The documentary disc supplied with this set is truly wonderful.  It is entertaining and covers just about everything you would want to know about Dreyer.  It even shows photos of his mother and childhood.  It discusses his approach to his art and life's work in great detail.  Many interviews with his actors and staff are included.  Most of his major films are discussed in all aspects.  If you want to find out about the films of Carl Theodor Dreyer as well as his life and thoughts this is an excellent choice for you!",1139616000,3,768,4.5144927536231885
7944702,5,B00005M2C7,"This set is a great revelation for me - I was only familiar with Dreyer's work on silent films - these three movies are such detailed and beautifully paced movies. 'Ordet' is a film which seems to be a spiritual statement - but it could also be interpreted as the power of believing (which does not necissarily have to be religous). It is also a statement on society - sometimes  society is out of touch with reality or reason and it is only the crazy 'outcasts' who 'get it'. This, along with Bresson's 'Diary of a Country Priest' has become one of my favorite films on the subject of faith.

'Gertrude' is, in my opinion, an equally fascinating work. It is so beautiful to look at - there is one scene in a park where the water is shimmering in the background that made me just so startled at the possibilities of black and white cinema. The theme of Gertrude seems to be love and truth - but throughout the film the camera seems to take a neutral stance to what the characters are professing. 'Gertrude's' quest for love for example, is neither championed or denounced, it is simply observed. This is such an efffective way of telling a story - let the characters tell it.. I am so delighted and surprised by Dreyer's sound films - and I would highly recommend them!",1137024000,4,1269,4.44206008583691
7944703,4,B00005M2C7,"Watch out, cinema lovers!  Carl Theodor Dreyer is a unique director, and his films require a special kind of patience.  Day of Wrath, Ordet and Gertrude are fascinating and sometimes difficult (especially the last two) films, but rewarding if you allow yourself to get involved. But the documentary accompanying this terrific Criterion release is dull, overly ""artistic"", and frankly not very informative. Only buy the box set if you're willing to watch and then discard it.  P.S. Also buy The Passion of Joan of Arc, and, if you can find it, Vampyr.",1080777600,5,550,4.956521739130435
7944704,5,B00005M2C7,It is fantastic that Criterion supervised this release.  The biography disc is OK - too bad we didn't get 'Vampyr' instead - but the three Dreyer movies alone are worth far more than Criterion asks us to pay.,1075852800,3,208,4.473684210526316
7944705,5,B00005M2C7,"This great package contains films by one on the masters of modern cinema. Dreyer's work provides a marvellous antidote to what passes for cinema in today's world. Dreyer's films are in effect works of art.
Of this set, my two favorites are Ordet and Gertrud. All of Carl Dreyer's film manage to magically combine the physical and the metaphysical. It takes time to get into the pace of these films, but one into them, they are totally absorbing. The pace required is that of real time. These films restore real emotion and humanity to film, so very different from what passes for emotion and feeling in most of today's Hollywood productions.
To understand these films it is necessary to work from the inside out as it were. We are required to do the work for ourselves. We have to think and feel for ourselves as we watch these films. They are theraputic in the sense that the viewer has to slow down and pay attention. Everything counts in a Dreyer film.
These film are at one and the same time abstract and very personal. I can see how they have influenced fellow Dane Lars von rier.
For  anyone is looking for action and external excitement in their films, I would suggest that they look elsewhere, but if they are want to see meditative works of art, this is the place to find them.",1024012800,7,1286,4.51931330472103
