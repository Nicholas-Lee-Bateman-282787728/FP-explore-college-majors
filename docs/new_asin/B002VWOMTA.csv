4001940,3,B002VWOMTA,"The characters in this movie are not complicated and pretty much what one would expect from TV writers. The story centers around Kylie Shines, the daughter of famous HOF race car driver Al Shines. Kylie lives with her aunt who has raised her since her mother died from ovarian cancer, a disease which plagues family TV specials. She is estranged from her father as she blames him for not being there (he was racing!) during important events in her life. The spoiled Kylie, who is successful in the junior circuit gets a chance to race with the big boys. The racing team which sponsors her father has canned him and replaced him with his daughter Kylie. She has a mechanic, who is in love with her, who she believes she needs for her race car. Meanwhile she meets Kid Walker (Jeff Gordon clone) a playboy and successful race car driver who beds her early on as she falls in love during two music montages. The movie climaxes with a publicity race between Kid, Kylie, and Al. No plot twists. The performances are okay and at times Michelle Trachtenberg acts as if she is trying out for a role on Nickelodeon. The movie is more about Kylie then race car driving. No nudity (old guy in underwear, suggested nudity), no sexual scenes (two people kissing in bed) and the ""A"" word is the worse language. Very PG rating oriented.",1287705600,6,1321,4.554621848739496
