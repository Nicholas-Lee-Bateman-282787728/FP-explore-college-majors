Don't expect alot of plot explanation..there isn't any.  The killers motivation is NEVER even hinted at..he is pissed off and he is killing with a BIG KNIFE and thats all you will ever know, but hey it was fun and watchable and for the cheap price a must for collectors.",1222905600,,401,4.2631578947368425

208555,3,6300146464,"Here we go again another slasher flick from the early 80s. After the success of John Carpenter's Halloween and Sean Cunningham's Friday the 13th it seemed every horror flick coming out in the early 80s was a slasher movie. From 1981 we have the college campus based slasher Final Exam.

Final Exam is one of the forgotten slasher flicks of the 80s while it's still remembered by some regardless of if the person liked it or not Final Exam is a slasher you don't hear much about. Despite the bad reputation the movie gets I personally think it's a bit better than it. There's nothing here we haven't seen before, but Final Exam also strays from the typical slasher flick.

After the first two murders no one else dies for about the next 55-minutes, which is bound to turn some people off. If not for a couple of shots of the killer wandering around the college campus you might even forget you're watching a slasher flick. The first half of the movie is a mix of a comedy full of pranks and jokes and even some sappy dramatic moments. With all of this happening some of the audience might get bored with the lack of thrills.

Final Exam tries to be more than the typical slasher flick; writer/director Jimmy Huston takes his time and actually develops the characters. Most of the characters here are the typical characters we see in slasher flicks. Only difference instead of being in the movie for a few minutes before getting killed they stay around a lot longer before getting killed.

The characters are still 1-dimesnional, but better developed than most in this type of movie since we spend so much time with them. Final Exam may not rate as one of the greatest slasher flicks from the 80s, but I do think it's one of the better written ones. The script is nothing amazing. But it does work for the most part. Like I said while the characters are the typical slasher movie characters the fact so much time is spent with them we get to know them slightly better. Radish played by Joel Rice seems to be a pretty big influence on the Randy character from writer Kevin Williamson.

But that is part of the reason why Final Exam takes so much heat from slasher fans. The final 35-minutes though deliver with about 8-death scenes, but the problem is the gore is lacking. There isn't any gore at all. The closest we come to any of the red stuff is some blood splatter. So taking all this into account it's quite easy to understand why Final Exam is a mostly forgotten slasher flick. But despite all that I do think the movie is better than what most people say. If you can make it through the first hour and not be bored you'll be happy with the last half.

As director Jimmy Huston does a fairly good job. It's quite obvious he was a fan of Halloween. There were many shots Halloween inspired with the killer just walking into frame. In the first half like I said it was more of a comedy/drama than a horror flick, but every so often the killer would appear which would remind us we are watching a horror flick; but even with those couple of shots the sense of dread and looming danger is never quite there. I actually wasn't bored by the first half for the most part it held my attention. But the 2nd half is when things begin to pick up.

The 2nd half of Final Exam gets to the stalk and slash aspect and while not the best I have seen it is fairly effective. The only problem though is that it does suffer from being too much. Once the killings start it just too many one after another, while the set ups are fairly good it just is too many coming at once. The death scenes are pretty much the same. The set up though again is fairly good, while I can't say Final Exam is scary, but there is some decent suspense.

The final act works rather well as the killer played by Timothy L. Raynor chases Courtney played by Cecile Bagdadi all around the college campus. There are some solid suspense scenes and while it may not go down in slasher movie history it is effective and gets the job done.

The acting here is slightly better than most of slasher flicks; while the acting isn't great I think it was a little better than most and Cecile Bagdadi made for a likeable heroine.

The most interesting aspect of Final Exam is the killer lacks any motivation. We never find out his name or why he is killing people. Normally back in the 80s the killer had some sort of motivation. A lot of the times it was about revenge. The victims sometimes had a connection to the killer and other times they had no connection. But normally it was some sort of revenge aspect. Even in the slasher movies where there was no revenge story, we would get a little history on the killer. But here we never find anything about the killer.

Some people disliked that concept, but I think it works rather well. It would be nice to know a little something, but it does add some realism. Most serial killers target random people. There might be a connection between the victims, maybe hair color or style. So the fact we never learn anything about the killer is a little disappointing, but also works in my opinion.

Even though I did enjoy Final Exam it's not much of a surprise it isn't highly talked about. 1981 was a big year for slasher movies. In 1981 we had Jason's debut as the killer in Friday the 13th Part II, Halloween II, The Prowler, My Bloody Valentine and The Burning just to name a few. Compared to those, Final Exam lacks in the gore and or nudity department. But despite all that I must say again I think Final Exam is slightly better than the reputation it gets.

Final Exam does lack the thrills and suspense and is quite weak in the gore area and there is only one scene with any nudity. But despite these flaws I still enjoyed the movie. There is some decent suspense at times, but not enough for Final Exam to stand out. Slasher fans have already probably sought this one out for those not really into slashers it's probably best you skip this one.

In closing, Final Exam is a flawed film, but despite those flaws I did enjoy the movie.",1197244800,10,6033,4.384615384615385
208556,1,6300146464,this one tried for something new but failed at every turn. a lack of scares os thrills kills this before the killing begins and we never learn who or why the killings take place. just a big pile of goo that goes nowhere,1147996800,,219,4.116279069767442
208557,1,6300146464,this movie is a mess. it starts off like a collage comedy then some prankerts fake a mass shooting (this part is very hard to take after all the bad things like that  witch have happened ). the the slasher takes stage. the last 45 mins. is his rampage. we never know anything about him or why he kills . if your a gore hound there isn't even any blood to get you by. a very poor movie,1140134400,2,384,3.923076923076923
208558,2,6300146464,"There certainly are some entertaining parts to this movie, but that is also where it fails. This slasher movie consists of quite a few slasher scenes that are loosely held together by the thinnest of plots (Oh gee, and that is unique for slasher films?). There is no reason given for the killer other than he apparently woke up one morning and decided to go out and kill people; as provided by the paranoid nerd/genius (a brain is a terrible thing to waste). The pacing of the movie is good with some well done action scenes. Whether as a result of editing and/or scripting, the killer is either in two places at once or the fastest SOB to weild a knife. Although, when he starts his spree, any story that was developing stops and it is just one slasher scene after another. One scene of interest in where the slasher catches an arrow with his hand; which is well done. There are several well done scenes; unfortunately it becomes a collection of slasher scenes with nothing to hold it together. This is a shame. With a little more story and a little more humor they could have had a good movie or a good parody; as it is, it is neither.-Bob",1096588800,4,1141,4.412322274881516

Movie Review: Considering I'm into these kind of slasher movies I liked it. But, in reality, it's utterly moronic. WHO THE HELL DOES A SCHOOL SHOOTING PRANK!? GOD! There is no purpose, no meaning as to why this killer is killing these people. He just wandering into this school and kills people for no reason and that is that. Hence, the plot is thinner that my d***! The killings are neat but R rated neat so don't expect a lot of gore.
This movie is only recommend to slasher film connoisseurs.

208599,4,6300146464,"I was pretty surprised with this slasher flick. It has a random killer with no motive, no mask, no backstory yet I was okay with it. When I watch a slasher flick, I mostly prefer it when a killer is wearing a creepy mask, but this one pulls it off pretty well. It's the day of the final exam, and students are preparing for the difficult test. Meanwhile, a fraternity pulls off a college shooting prank as a diversion to cheat during the test. Later that night, a killer shows up and starts offing the students who stayed over. Some of the kills are pretty good, and they hide the killer's face in the shadows until the last 10 minutes of the movie. If you love 80's slashers, I would definitely recommend FINAL EXAM!!!",1421366400,,719,4.373134328358209

208605,2,6300146464,"For every good slasher film in the 1980s, there were ten that should've never seen the light of day. Some of those misfires have gained cult status over the years for one reason or another. It's tough to truly judge a movie in a genre that celebrates bad acting, cheesy dialogue, and nonsensical plots. 1981's ""Final Exam"" is a perfect example of one such film that is beloved by many today for, in my opinion, no good reason at all.

A serial killer walks the streets of Lanier College as the students prepare for a week of final exams and frat hazing. With no apparent motive or target demographic, the murderer hunts down both jocks and nerds without prejudice. Can anyone stop the madman before he takes his next victim?

I can appreciate what Writer/Director Jimmy Huston was trying to do with ""Final Exam."" He was attempting to make a film in the vein of ""Halloween"" using Hitchcock's sensibilities and techniques. Huston did his best to establish characters the audience would connect to. Unfortunately, the fact that none of the performers playing them could act annihilated any hopes of that happening.

It would've also helped if the murderer had ANY sort of motive for his killing spree. It's just some guy following college kids around and butchering them. B-O-R-I-N-G! Slasher movies either have to have one thing or another going for it. It has to be suspenseful or graphic and gory when it comes to the violence. ""Final Exam"" doesn't excel in either of these areas. The suspense is smothered by a lack of motivation and the kill scenes are absent of any real substance or bloodshed.

The Blu-ray version of ""Final Exam"" boasts a new high-definition transfer from the original camera negative. The film looks cleaner than I'm sure it ever has on VHS or in the theater. However, the movie maintains its 1980s visual edge by not looking too digitally cleaned up. It's presented in 1080p High-Definition Widescreen (1.78:1).

A new DTS-HD Master Audio Mono mix guarantees viewers of ""Final Exam"" have never heard the film as clear as you do on Blu-ray. Every bump, shutting door, and puncturing knife-stab rings out. Music composer Gary Scott's attempt at mimicking the ""Halloween"" soundtrack perfectly accents this ""paint-by-numbers"" slashfest.

One thing you can always count on with Scream Factory is their inclusion of special features. While there's not as many as we've come to expect from past releases, ""Final Exam"" includes new interviews with cast members Joel Rice, Cecile Bagdadi, and Sherry Willis-Burch. A theatrical trailer is included as well.

""Final Exam"" is rated R for violence, language, adult situations, and nudity. Of course, there's the obligatory boob shot all slasher films must have. There's so little onscreen gore that the movie quite possibly could air right after an episode of ""Goosebumps"" on Teen Nick. If made today without the one scene of nudity, it might earn a PG-13 rating for its content.

As far as slasher movies are concerned, ""Final Exam"" is a weak entry into the genre. I'm sure many fans of the film will disagree with me and they have every right to. I can't consider it an essential piece of horror history based on its lack of motivation, suspense, and gore. Without those elements, it's just another bland B-movie with bad acting.",1398988800,2,3292,4.908273381294964

208629,5,6300146464,"When you see a list of favorite slasher films of the 80's, very rarely do you see Final Exam on any of those lists. Final Exam is personally one of my favorites, and it really deserves more fans than it has.

The plot of Final Exam is simple. A killer is stalking a college campus. Will anyone survive the night? That's it! There's no twists, there's nothing complex, there's not even any surprises, Final Exam is just a very simple slasher film. But don't let that turn you away! There's alot to love here aside from the fact that the film is pure entertainment. One of Final Exam's biggest strengths was that it actually had a decent amount of suspense and dread. The director was clearly a big fan of Halloween, and though the killer here is no Michael Myers the film does at times keep you on the edge of your seat. Another thing I liked was the setting! Out of all the dorm slashers out there, Final Exam has one of the most realistic dorm settings I've seen, and the director fully utilizes the whole campus to create the perfect atmosphere. There seems to be shadows everywhere, and it works. The director did a fantastic job all around.
Now the film gets a reputation of being a bit slow, but I didn't find it slow honestly. Sure the killer takes awhile to get going, but the cast here is very good, and keep things fun to watch. The acting is all around good too, and I really liked the film's lead. Some may say she's no Laurie Strode, but there was something very real and likable about her. Also you can't mention the cast without mentioning Radish. Clearly an inspiration for Scream's Randy, Radish is definitly one of the more memorable early 80's slasher film characters, and he's very likable and easy to root for. His character could've easily came off as somewhat annoying, but instead he's anything but annoying.

The Scorpion dvd itself is also very good. The picture looks good overall, and the extras are solid. The film comes with a producers commentary, a few cast interviews, a trailer for Final Exam, and some trailers for other 80's horror films. Not bad at all.

Overall Final Exam is terrific slasher fun. If you're not a fan of slasher films then this film won't convert you. If you're just starting out on the genre then I'd probably tell you to watch something else first. But for 80's slasher fans, Final Exam is pure bliss.
Definitly worth watching for fans of the genre.",1372636800,16,2405,4.524137931034483

208631,4,6300146464,"Growing up in the 80's was an awesome time for me. After seeing Tobe Hooper's The Funhouse, at age 12, and being horrified to walk down my street during a bright sunny day because of John Carpenter's Halloween, I was forever marked by this genre. Big time~!

I adore old slasher films from the early 80's. They are so much a part of me.
Many people have songs that take them back to a certain time or special moment. Horror movies do that for me. However, sadly, I will have to admit, I somehow missed out on seeing 'Final Exam' at the theater. Of course when it arrived on video, I watched it a handful of times. I liked it back then, but didn't love.

But now, after buying it from Amazon on DVD, and watching it a few times, I keep asking myself what is it...(?)...about this low-budget film that I keep coming back to so much. It IS a total Halloween rip off. Right up there with 'He knows your alone'.From the score to the style.

The 'Final Exam' killer stalks in shadows and watches, and waits, and watches some more, just like Michael Myers did in Halloween. He's not in any big hurry. And he doesn't even wear a mask. It's just some big, poker-faced guy. Matter of fact, not much happens till the last ten minutes or so, and even then, during the big chase scene, it's very low-key.

I think that's what I like about it. It's quiet style. Almost like a TV movie. Like one of those stories you may see on a true-crime show like 20/20. A dramatized version, if you will. It tells it's story and then it simply ends.

I can't explain it but the movie has a lot of heart. It also, for me, has to do with the characters. Yeah, they are dull, but not in a bad way. The teens on campus just seem to be more 'realistic' than other bodycount films from that time. You kind of really care for them. I really like the little nerdy guy, Radish and his little crush on the leading lady. Even the blond tramp is likable.

There's a quiet scene, right before she gets killed, where she is playing the piano, in an isolated part of the building that is just, sincere and gentle. Here's another moment when it feels like a docu-drama. You're almost expecting to hear commentary from a grieving relative about how she loved playing music. There's alot of scenes like this. Granted, most people would think this to be boring for a slasher film, and, to be honest, in many ways, it is. But for me, I like these scenes. It gives the film a bleak feel.

What's also interesting is the way the film is cut. Almost like a Jaws-effect. As our tramp plays the piano, the film cuts to other places around the campus, allowing the viewer to wonder where the killer is, or, when the shark is gonna pop up. Another girl gets a soda, more flash cuts appear. Earlier that evening, a boy is tied to a tree partially naked. As he begs for help, the scene takes its time, showcasing a variety of close-ups and wide-shots of the dark grounds around him. Here, again, in crime-drama style, could be another insert of a grave voice, perhaps a police man, reporting that it was nine-fifteen pm, or something like that, before the male was attacked. What's interesting is that this movie could be 're-edited' and turned into a grim police file like 'The Town that Dreaded Sundown' did years back.

There's also this great little shot where the leading girl ditches her tray on the way out of the cafeteria and the camera then follows the tray into the kitchen, and, eventually, into the dishwasher's hands. Then, the camera follows the dishwasher out of the building and down the steps to a nearby garbage can, where he then, crosses the leading girl who just arrived out of the cafeteria. Okay, big deal, right? Sure. Maybe to most. But the traveling-trick was also laying out something important. It was showing you the battle grounds for where the killer will later pursue the leading girl.(Where that tray went earlier...so will the killer.) I thought this was kind of neat. For a low-budget movie, far from Hollywood, there was creative thought that went into this scene.

Matter of fact, it happens a lot throughout this film. For instance, we are introduced at the beginning of the movie to the leading girl sitting inside the top of an old tower. That said tower will also play an important part in the finale of the film, sort of creating a 'book-end' like effect for the movie. Simple, but, well thought out. I've always liked films that come full circle. 'Halloween 3:Season of the Witch' did it beautifully! (Characters in panic showed up at the same gas station in the beginning of the movie and at the end). A terrific film-circle!

Another big reason why this movie has suddenly turned me on after all these years was listening to the actor's comments on the dvd's special features. These people reflected back with loving memories about the shoot, especially the actor who played Radish. You can tell by listening to him how proud he is of the film. Everyone, including the makers involved in the film, seemed proud and humble. They laughed, they joked and really seemed to be having a great time talking about this little movie and their five minutes of fame. This made me like their characters even more. It sort of rounded them out for me.

If you're looking for gore, forget it. Like I said, it's sort of like a Halloween clone. But dry. Lots of mysterious shadows, wide shots of the campus and soft jingle, Halloween-style music.

There's the usual chit chat among college girls, a few randy sorority boys and a really obnoxious actor playing a big haired, jock named 'Wildman' who seems to be acting from no script in particular. Just kind of doing whatever he pleases. He's very unhinged and touchy-feely with most of the other actors. Especially nerdy Radish. He likes to bully Radish around quite a bit. But at the same times, seems to really like the little guy. Radish seems to be sweet on him as well, but, that's another story for another time. And, of course, because 'Wildman' is so over the top, he's gotta die horribly.

And finally, I have to note how much I love the murder scene of the trampy blond in the art gallery. It's very...on purpose. By design. Almost impressionistic. I think anyone studying horror films would find it very interesting. It's like a 'paint by numbers' Psycho homage. It's hard to explain. The girl looks up...the knife comes down...her leg drops...knife comes up...white sheet turns red...knife comes down...white sheet drops. It's a very robotic scene, motorized like, not at all interested with nudity, or gore, but fashion and manner. To many gorehounds, this murder scene will appear cheap and empty, but to me, it's odd and dreamlike. If you're a visual artist, and can appreciate things on a very low scale, you should check it out. If anyone out there fits this mold, and sort of gets where I'm coming from, write back, let me know. I would love to hear other people's point of view on this kills scene, or the movie in general.

When it comes to early slasher films, 'Final Exam' doesn't have much to offer to the formula, but if you look closely you can see a few things, here and there, where the makers had more than just exploitation on their minds. But once again, what's that old saying? Something about the 'eye of the beholder'. And this film definately pleases my eye. Thanx for reading...kEVIN bRIAN",1339372800,8,7348,4.548411497730711
208632,3,6300146464,"""Final Exam"" begins with two college students (Carol Capka and Shannon Norfleet) busy making out in a parked convertible. Ignoring the girl's frequent objections, her boyfriend pushes on. Watching this scene I couldn't help but think of Slasher Studios' own ""Popularity Killer."" Crazy how slasher minds tend to think alike as I had never seen this slasher before writing own film. Well, wouldn't you know it, there is a sound outside...a shadowy madman jumps on top of the car, slicing his way through the fabric roof. Reaching inside, the lunatic grabs the young man and pulls him up and out onto the car's hood. Brandishing a blade, the killer stabs the poor man to death. Cue opening credits and we are off to a decent start to a decent slasher that you will forget about ten minutes after you are done watching it.

Sleepy Lanier College is nearing the end of Final Exam week, a frenzied semester cap time of grades, goodbyes and pranks. As the students prepare for their tests as well as the coming vacation break, little do they suspect a psycho in a black van is stalking them one by one. Plain but amiable Courtney (Cecile Bagdadi) is completing her exams and studying hard. Averse to hitting the books, her roommate Lisa (DeAnna Robbins) is busy packing and getting back to the city.

Meanwhile, Gamma Delta fraternity pledge Gary (Terry W. Farren) has pinned his girlfriend Janet (Sherry Willis-Birch)...and paid for it by being treed by his brothers, stripped to his briefs, awash in shaving cream and ice cubes shoved down his underwear. As night falls on Lanier, a freezing Gary hopes his beloved Janet will free him from his humiliation. Untied from the tree by an unknown figure, Gary breathes a sigh of relief...and is then stabbed to death on quadrangle lawn. The fun has now begun!

The problem with ""Final Exam"" is that the last thirty minutes of this film are pretty damn good: suspenseful, fun, and very entertaining. The deaths are mainly bloodless but the suspense is plentiful. Unfortunately it takes an HOUR of lame college hijinks to get the fun stuff. I love character development in horror movies but the little we get to know about these characters in this hour could have easily been covered in twenty minutes tops. That's not to say this isn't worth a watch. The acting is pretty solid all the way around and the film is never truly boring. Nonetheless, there is a great slasher here just waiting to be unleashed. This is a film that I would kill to see a remake of. As is, this movie is fairly run-of-the-mill. Nothing special, nothing great, but nothing all too terrible either.",1328486400,2,2611,4.746696035242291

It was out for a while then went out of print. Good 2 see its back, in a remasterd state, with some xtras. I love the late 80's horror comedys alot, but i find myself wanting 2 watch all the 1980 to 1982 films the most right now. Because they try 2 scare you, the music[scores], and nostalgic feel. The films about a killer on campus picking off victims, nothing ground breaking, or extra cool deaths, like in Sleepaway camp,just b4 the dawn. But has watchable characters, added humor,decent supense. Things wrong with it; no back story or reason behind the killer, if there was i didn't catch it, and the weird little gay guys atrip, but, he makes it memorble,and it leaves you asking ""so what happend"". But like i said if you are wanting a 80's horror film to ad to ur colletion, this is a good one. Its not pure crap like some i've seen from this decade.

208635,5,6300146464,"As a huge fan of 1980 horror/slasher films I was very, very eager to watch ""Final Exam"".  I had heard so much about it, both good and bad things.  In addition, I had seen the trailer/preview on other DVD releases but wasn't able to get my hands on it.  The only DVD available at the time was out of print and being sold at a hefty price.  Adding insult to injury, I wasn't able to rent it anywhere.  Therefore when this most recent addition became available I gobbled it up.

The story is very simple and basic, but aren't all of these horror flicks from the 80s?  It is the end of the semester at Lanier College and most of the student body has left the campus.  The remanding students are studying and/or cramming for final exams, when they aren't joking around. Enter the killer who roams the campus slowly taking out each student one by one.

As for the characters, there is the usually gallery of college students (victims); the dumb jock, the obnoxious frat guy, the eager frat pledge, the nerdy guy, the easy girl, the love struck girl and the nice girl.  The nice girl is Courtney and is played by Cecile Bagdadi.  Courtney is a pretty girl in a ""girl next door"" sort of way.  She is sweet and actually the film gives time for her character to develop a bit, which makes her a great ""final girl"".

As for character development, this movie actually has it. This might seem odd for a slasher film but it is true.  All of the characters have apt amount of screen time before they meet their demise.  I actually found this refreshing, different and interesting.  I will return to this notion in a moment.

As for the killer himself, he is just some guy, some random dude killing people.  He doesn't wear a mask or costume.  There is no complex origin of how or why he became deranged, he just is.  Actually from a distance he could be a stunt double for a young and frumpy Jim Belushi.

I recall hearing/reading that ""Final Exam"" is a failure in the slasher genre due to the following elements:

* Extremely slow pace
* Lack of gore
* Banality of the killer
* A wannabe ""Halloween""

I must say I loved this movie for the same reasons it is disdained.

Extremely slow pace

I found the slow pace a ruse to promote character development and build tension.  Not to mention the college campus setting was extremely different.  I believe at this point in time slasher films only took place at a camp.  The lighting and mood created many eerie aspects in this film. The shot under the basketball score board is a prime example.

Lack of gore

As for the lack of gore it really didn't bother me.  There was blood in this movie, but there weren't bucks of guts, blood and entrails.  I love gore in a flick but it isn't a deal breaker.

Banality of the killer

The ""insipidness"" of the killer I found interesting.  Many times in these types of movies there is a long and winded story of why the killer came to be. In this movie the guy is just blooming nuts.  No rhyme, no reason, and no explanation he is just crazy and that is all there is to it.

A wannabe ""Halloween""

As for a ""Halloween"" rip off, no it really isn't. Michael Myers is a complex character and Bootleg Jim Belushi is not. The only comparison I can make to ""Halloween"" and ""Final Exam"" is the catch phrases in the trailers.  In ""Halloween"" it is ""The Night He Came Home""; in ""Final Exam"" it is ""He's Come Back"".  Since there is no background on the killer in this movie it is sort of silly to state ""He's Come Back"" but whatever....

As for this DVD edition, it is pretty cool.  As for the transfer of the film, it is wonderful.  The picture is crisp and clear, as is the audio.  The movie has a ""play only"" option or watch the movie with an intro and outro by Katarina Leigh Waters. KLW use to be on WWE, I don't really watch wrestling so this was my first exposure to her.  I found her intro to be great mainly because she gave some basic info about the movie but didn't provide any spoilers.  I found her remarks witty and insightful.  The outro was also pretty cool.  She also provides a commentary track with one of the producers of ""Final Exam"".  I haven't heard the commentary yet. Another feature is some interviews with some of the cast from the film. There are also some trailers for other movies in this DVD series.

I absolutely loved ""Final Exam"" I loved the dualism within the title of the motion picture.  I will be watching this movie again and again for years to come.  I do think slasher and 1980s horror fans should give this a go.  This movie if nothing else is a testament that I have no plans to go back to college.",1320710400,7,4601,4.32046783625731
208636,1,6300146464,"In my quest to see all the horror films, obscure or not, that I have not seen, or haven't seen in a long time, this is one that was always on my list. One I have always heard about, and usually not very favorably. I had never seen the movie, but despite the more negative notices than positive I have heard, I still wanted to see it. A killer slashing college kids on campus from the early 80s? I'm there! After all, I have certainly loved movies like this that were just as panned. So, I was willing to give this obscure 1981 film the benefit of the doubt. Turns out, the negative reviews were right.

The movie takes place at Lanier College. Two students at a nearby college have been murdered by a mysterious killer (who seems to be sporting Javier Bardem's haircut for 'No Country For Old Men'). The killer with the large knife sets his sights on Lanier next. Sadly, because of a previous student hoax that called the sheriff out, the authorities don't believe it when students call for help. They are left alone with the killer and his blade.

Coming out during the 'Golden Age' of slasher films, it's easy to see why this movie got lost in the shuffle and, fittingly, wasn't well received. Even though it grew in favoritism among some fans and received a healthy cult following, ""Final Exam"", when all is said and done, is a boring, forgetful dud. It takes a good hour or so, after the opening murders, to get anything resembling a slasher film going again. That whole time is spent with some of the most un-unique, boring, flat 'vanilla' characters I have ever seen in a slasher film. We meet them, we see them constantly walking across campus, we see campus hazing, uninteresting dialogue scenes, etc. Basically, not much is happening, and we are spending it with people we couldn't care less about. The movie just wastes so much time on stuff that just a few minutes of in another slasher film would already seem too much. A good chunk of the entire film is this! When the film does kick in in the last 20 minutes or so, things definitely liven up and it does become very watchable. The hour or so getting there is very sleep inducing. There isn't much in the way of gore or inventive kills either. Some people will say that ""Halloween"" was like that too. But you see, ""Halloween"" was a great movie with likewise killer, script, cast, etc. It also had suspense and scares. This movie has none of the above. The score isn't bad, but the opening atmopsheric score, even though it is good, still seems to be lifted from Carpenter himself. There isn't much in the way of eerie atmopshere (although the campus itself is a nice setting), or suspense. The movie spends a lot of time building up a whole lot of nothing. Even though the ending steps it up, it's still a bit too late to really care. It's too bad. There was a set up here that could of been used for great effect and tension. Students, who with their earlier prank, are left to their own devices with a serial killer without the help of outside forces. Sadly, the movie never jumps on that opportunity. In fact, the movie doesn't seem to jump on anything.

What about the people? The cast? The killer? It appears that most of the cast have never been in a movie before. That's what it feels like. Our main heroine, Courtney(Cecile Bagdadi), doesn't even seem like the main girl. She's cute, innocent, but also bland. She just comes across as just some random girl until the very end. That any one of her two friends could easily of been the final girl themselves. Even though she is sweet and likeable, she is one of the least intriguing and memorable 'final girls' I have ever come across. We don't really get to know her. She's just....there. Then there is the character of Radish. People love him. People hate him. I won't say anymore. I will leave it up to you to discover this guy for yourself. The rest are typical, nothing special fodder for the killer. As for the killer himself, aside from his special haircut I already mentioned, there is nothing special or unique about him. He is a normal looking dude with no mask or costume. Just some guy we see. There is no backstory, there is no motive, there is no nothing. Sometimes this can work (""Black Christmas""), but more often than not, it doesn't (""The Slumber Party Massacre""). He doesn't elicit much fear or interest, and like the heroine he chases in the end, is incredibly forgettable.

This new edition is part of ""Katarina's Nightmare Theater"", hosted by Katarina Leigh Waters. According to the box, she is a former 'WWE diva' and current 'TNA knockout'. Yeah, I don't know her either. She has opening and ending segments hosting the movie (although you can watch it without). I really don't see the point of this as the whole thing is pretty amateurish and pointless and has no real reason for existence. You can also find the trailer and interviews with a few cast members here.

""Final Exam"" is a movie that never rises above boring mediocrity. I love these kinds of movies, but I am hard pressed to really find much of anything good to write here. I was hoping the fans who love it were right and there would be a new lost gem for me to discover. This movie is just not it. This exam was a major fail.",1318032000,3,5235,4.483228511530398
208637,3,6300146464,"I saw this little gem in the theater when I was in high school. I left the theater kinda annoyed.  It follows the typical dead teenager movie format(as I call this genre of film. Thank you Roger Ebert). There are a handful of kids in a unpopulated environment and suddenly they begin to disappear.  There is a killer out there and he seems pissed.  There is a slight difference from most of the horror/slasher movies made at the time.  And this is way I am not a bigger fan of this movie.  There is no acknowledged connection between the killer and anything or anyone in the movie.

Having a killer randomly offing the cast of a movie is what we come to the movie to see. We get into the scare. The anticipation of where the killer is and how will they dispose of the next victim. Morbid but all in good fun, if that makes any sense.  But this one doesn't offer any connection. He is just a random person on a killing spree and then the movie sets itself up to be continued.  In the same way most of these movies do. Taking that hook from Halloween. So this is way I can't glowingly recommend this movie.  I wouldn't buy it, I like it mostly for it's sentimental aspects as a reminder of my youth but unless there is a director, writer commentary or special feature on the DVD that offers an explanation of the killers existence, I can't fully recommend it.  I'm just sayin'.",1313020800,,1375,4.315175097276264
208638,2,6300146464,"I first saw FINAL EXAM in the 1980s in Forest Hills, NY's Continental Theater.  Back then the poster's tag line was: ""They survived four years of college, but will they survive the ... FINAL EXAM!""

I thought it was okay then. I bought it on Beta and watched it every five or six years, though FINAL EXAM loses its appeal over time.  I now rented the DVD from the library, and yes, it's a bad film.

Why do I watch it?  I'm a hardcore horror fan, and often prefer a poor horror film to a new film of some other genre.

That said, this is one of the more boring 1980s slasher films.  It opens with the slasher killing a college couple in a car.  Then a prank killing.  Then ... nothing happens.  Not until we're nearly 55 minutes into the film.

That's too long for nothing to happen.  Yet for the film's first two thirds, FINAL EXAM focuses on the hijinks of some nondescript college kids.  The Slut, the Ditsy Girl, the Good Girl, the Nerdy Guy, and two Frat Jocks.  They're not interesting; their dialog and situations are pedestrian (e.g., frat initiation pranks, stealing a test paper, etc.).

After 55 minutes, the killings start up and continue at a fast pace until the end.  But that's too long to wait, unless you have an interesting story or characters, which FINAL EXAM lacks.

Even worse, the slasher is boring.  One of the most nondescript slashers I've ever seen, right down there with that slasher from HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE, and with even less motivation.

And we see his face.  Bad move.  A strong slasher should be enigmatic, not nondescript.  Jason and Myers wear masks.

FINAL EXAM's slasher is a pudgy, silent guy in his late 20s or early 30s.  We learn nothing about him.  Not even a news report about an escape asylum patient.  The Nerdy Guy says anyone can wake up one day and decide to kill, so maybe the slasher's ordinariness is intentional, but it doesn't work.

FINAL EXAM mistakenly violates the mask rule, but it follows other slasher film rules.  The slasher has superhuman strength, easily killing a bigger frat guy.  There's also a Last Girl. (It's the Good Girl, of course.)

I don't know why the DVD is so expensive.  The transfer is decent, but not perfect.  Sometimes the film jiggles, and there are occasional dirty spots.

FINAL EXAM was shot on North Carolina's E.O. Studios, which also gave us HOUSE OF DEATH.

Special Features include interviews with three of the actors, which is nice.

But hold off until the price comes down.  FINAL EXAM is not an historic or seminal slasher film, nor even a very good one.  Only slasher film completists will enjoy it to any degree.",1298419200,2,2612,4.551724137931035

208643,2,6300146464,"Final Exam (Jimmy Huston, 1981)

The best thing about Final Exam is a spoiler, and so I can't really come right out and say it, but it's something that really, really confused me when I first saw it back in the day and really, really impresses me now. It's something that I can't remember any other slasher film doing, before or since. Which if you think about it is pretty darned impressive. That's not to say this is a good movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it certainly makes it memorable. I hadn't seen it, before a few nights ago, in something like twenty-five years, and I still remembered a great deal about it. (Of course, this could be because I also still had the novelization of the movie, and read it obsessively in seventh and eighth grades; for that matter, I may still have my copy around here somewhere, as beaten-up as it must be by now.) One way or the other, though, it was much as I remembered it, though now dated and seeming somewhat clich now that I have a larger grasp on the history of slasher movies than I did in the early eighties. Back then, I'd only seen two or three. I don't want to think about how many I've seen now...

Plot: it's time for finals (actually, I could swear that in a few places, they say it's actually midterms, but I guess Midterm Exam didn't quite have the same ring to it) at a small college in the middle of nowhere. A killer struck (in the movie's opening scene) at another college just down the road, which has got everyone pretty keyed up as well, which isn't helped when the local numbskull fraternity plays a practical joke that sends some of the more gullible students scurrying for the cops. (Cue obvious ""boy who cried wolf"" subplot.) Of course, the killer has migrated, and starts picking off some of the last students left on campus, as most have already gone home for break.

It's your typical slasher, except for that one thing (the question you're left with at the end of the movie? Yeah, that one thing), so don't go into it looking for any revelations vis-a-vis the acting, camerawork, score, or anything else; it's very typical of its subspecies in every other way. Still, that one thing does make it well worth your time if you're even a casual fan of the slasher movie, so in that case, you should probably hunt it down. **",1238371200,,2305,4.431603773584905

Now if her boyfriend , whom she worshiped had dumped her because she was not a member of a female sibling fraternity and he has to stay in his father and gf fraternity, now that would have been a motive for the killer after she killed herself. Recognizing  that this is a late 70s to early 80s film, it wasn't that bad. For Jason's first few sequels his motive was that he did not want anyone at Camp Crystal Lake. Michael Myers was hunting his sister and his neice that, in H2o , turned into a nephew. Freddy Kruger was after the children of the town that killed him when he was human.

This movie will be remembered as the only slasher where the killer kicks a victim in family jewels.",1226016000,3,695,4.663934426229508
208648,1,6300146464,"Slasher films have got to be the easiest type of movies to create-- grab a group of victims(the more the merrier), have at least half of them be female(and at some point nude), toss in a maniac on the loose, and WHAM-- you got yourself a winner!  Score some solid acting and production values, maybe even an actual plot-- now you've got some icing on the cake(but far from requisite additions)!  Simple right?  Well, for hundreds of no-name directors and actors throughout the 80's it was... unfortunately for everyone involved in Final Exam, not so much.  The story follows a small group of kids finishing up their college semester with only a few final exams left to take before they can pack up and head home.  The kids left consist of the prototypical Corvette driving womanizer, football playing lunkhead, blond tramp who uses her sexuality to ""get what she wants,"" obnoxious(and possibly gay) nerd, old drunken campus security guard, and the down to earth virgin girl(aka the heroine), among a few others that you've seen before in plenty of other films of this ilk.  A man drives up in his van... and the slashing begins.  Final Exam really is as generic as it sounds, with a killer who is fittingly just as generic: a semi-chubby guy with a butcher knife who looks about as menacing as the clerk at Wal-Mart's automotive section(in fact, I think this guy rotated my tires last week).  The movie delivers little nudity and even less blood or gore; the only thing more lifeless and dull than the characters is the lame killings by the aforementioned non-descript killer... but best of all has got to be the 54 minutes between the first killing and the next-- OUCH!  I think of myself as a fairly unpicky fan of Slasher cinema(just check my reviews for April Fool's Day and Happy Hell Night for verification LOL!) but Final Exam plays like the worst episode of Saved by The Bell ever... with 6 kills thrown in to snatch a R rating.  Only recommended for those that remember this from their youth, and harbor some(bizarre) fond nostalgic attachment to it... all others should skip this Final Exam!",1223683200,12,2101,4.715846994535519

7802911,5,6300146464,"Come the Halloween season of Oct this is definitely one of those early 80s slashers you'll want to check off your list.
Rolling out of the era is another slasher. This one stays pretty close to the Halloween mold (just listen to that theme tune).
A looming brute of a killer stalks a bunch of students picking them off one at a time. No mask on this guy but he still seems to have quite a menacing aura about him. What raises this one above the crowd is a pretty well written script (same guy who wrote 1986's ""Running Scared"", also worth checking out.) and some likable characters. I actually found myself quite liking the nerdy guy character in this one. which is quite unusual in this type of movie. There's a real lack of gore in Final exam as well which is surprising, with a majority of kills being off screen. This doesn't spoil the movie as it's more than made up for in the final moments with a great set piece to finish the whole thing off.
A definite must see for slasher fans, but if you're not a fan of the genre this isn't the one that's probably going to convert you.",1523059200,,1082,4.282926829268293
7802912,5,6300146464,"FINAL EXAM (1981) is about life at a typical college. Typical student, Courtney (Cecile Bagdadi) is just trying to get through her finals. Unfortunately, there's a mad slasher on the loose, already responsible for two murders at another college. What are the odds that said maniac will be at Courtney's college -Lenier- soon? Pretty good as it turns out! But first, mayhem erupts as we discover that some students will do anything to pull off a prank, or to keep up their GPA! The immediate thought I had was how such a ""joke"" / diversion would go over in today's social climate. Yikes! Anyway, back to the madman. He's stalking Courtney, able to roam freely in broad daylight, like a ghost. Courtney's beautiful, cranially-challenged roommate, Lisa (DeAnna Robins) is suitably oblivious, as is her murder-obsessed friend, Radish (Joel S. Rice). After what seems like a millennium of frat-boy hijinks, the mindless slaughter begins! In no time at all, dead jocks are folded into lockers, and nerds are turned into door decorations! How can Courtney possibly survive the onslaught of this carnage-crazed campus killer? Watch and be astounded! This one surprised me, especially the finale. Having never even heard of it before, I really enjoyed this slab of early 80's horror-cheddar!...",1522627200,,1285,5.123809523809523

7802915,4,6300146464,"The first time I viewed this movie, I wasn't so sure about it as at the time I had recently watched a whole lot of old slashers that have either a cult following or a mainstream following.  Once I watched this one solely and could allow it to be it's own movie, that was when I saw this movie's merits.

The movie starts out with the all too familiar opening involving a a guy and a girl pondering having sex in a car where it's quiet and private.  But unfortunately for the both of them a mysterious killer lurks in the shadows.  It isn't long before he makes short work of the boyfriend leaving the girlfriend screaming he head off.  We next focus on Lanier College where all of the students have the stress and pressures of passing their final exams as Summer break is approaching and many of the guys including one named Gary have to prove themselves to the Frat.  As they go through their longtime Frat pledge testing traditions, the killer isn't far behind.

For me honestly a good slasher is a good slasher; be it very gory, a little bit gory, or not gory at all.  Also regardless of whether it's got a detailed storyline, character development, or not too much of either, in many cases it can still be an enjoyable watch.  True there are some bad ones out there too, but unfortunately that just comes with the territory.

All of that being said; let's now get down to the brass tacks.

The characters:
-There's our main character Courtney.  A beautiful college student who studies hard and looks to pass but doesn't establish much personal time to have fun.
-Radish: An over-achieving nerdy classmate and dorm neighbor to Courtney of whom is a good friend to Courtney and he secretly has a big crush on her as well.
-Wildman: A loud, aggressive, fun-loving, and yes ""wild"" jock of whom hates Radish and is also a junkie.
-Gary: A nice and likable student of whom really wants to join the Frat.  He's also Janet's boyfriend.
-Lisa: Courtney's beautiful, sexy, flirtatious, and incredibly fun loving, roommate and friend.
-Janet: Courtney's other fun loving friend.
-Mark: Wildman's right-hand man/partner in crime when it comes to the Frat and pranks.

The score by Gary S. Scott was not only great classic 80's mood-setting music but it also delivers on the jump  scares when the killer attacks.

While there isn't much gore in this movie, the killer proves very intense, deeply psychotic, and quite versatile with whatever weapon he happens to have available to him.

There's not that much nudity but the nudity that you do get is excellent.

My only criticism of this movie is that the killer is a complete mystery.  I can handle his being silent and for the most part I can handle his lack of clear motives, but he should have at least been given a name if nothing else.

The intense camera pans and the killer being really good at hiding into obscurity both make for one really frightening movie.

Overall, if you enjoy a good 80's slasher, either like or don't mind some character development, enjoy an incredibly deadly, savvy, and intense serial killer, like a little nudity, and enjoy fun and mostly attractive people than this one should be right up your alley.",1501113600,2,3178,4.6292335115864525
7802916,3,6300146464,"Huh, I thought a final exam meant that once completing it you can breathe a sigh of relief.  In this case a final exam means the final moment of your life!

Final Exam is a low budget horror.  It doesn't really explain who the murderer is and why he's killing people.  Instead the story plays up that since these are college kids that like to play jokes and pull fraternity pranks on other classmates, that they're just goofing off and nobody -including the town cop with his fake southern accent- believes them whenever he gets a phone call that something went horribly wrong.  Even then the story never goes far enough into suspenseful territory and instead comes across as college kids partying and being silly.

The story seems to be divided into three sections.  The first is a HUGE ""What the heck!"" moment.  That being the first prank we see showing men wearing masks jumping out from a van and blasting machine gun fire all around campus.  Can you imagine if a prank like that happened today?  The consequences would be many years behind bars.  A big no no for sure!  Besides real life, can you imagine a movie including such a scene nowadays?  I highly doubt it'd be accepted.  But back in the 80's before school shootings spread across the nation, I guess nobody (including the movie writers) thought gunfire on school property was anything to think twice about.

Anyway this scene STUNNED me in a big way, but it's just a really intense prank to pull other party animals into the van and go somewhere to party.  That's all it is.  It felt so real though, right down to the kids taking a test in another part of the building and hearing horrific screams of the victims outside.  For *one* cop to show up afterwards is just... wow.  And he automatically assumes the college kids are pranking around and he feels the need to discipline them.  No way!

The second aspect of the story is the second fraternity prank.  That being forcing a fellow fraternity member to break into the teacher (or principal's) office and steal the cheat sheet for the final exam.  Once complete... well I hate to say it, but he's not done being pranked!  They take this helpless kid outside, take his clothes off, rope him around a tree and pour ice down his pants with a bunch of whipped cream to the face.  He has to stay out there all night since nobody wants to help.  I thought the one girl was getting some help since she even says she's going to get somebody, but instead she stays away.  I guess she forgot about the poor guy, lol.  Too bad he'll never know if he was humiliated enough to become an official member!

The third aspect involves the good girl (played by Cecile Bagdadi) who desires an education.  She doesn't care about using her looks to get by and make men do whatever she wishes (unlike her super hot dorm mate).  She falls in love with the nerdy boy down the hallway.  She's the final victim who tries to run away from the crazy guy with a knife.  It's hard to believe that (SPOILERS) neither one of them (Cecile or the nerdy boyfriend) survive the night.  In fact it's amazing that none of the main actors that dominate the first half don't survive either.  A lesser character does instead.

This is another SPOILER.  The final death scene is pretty lame.  Cecile's character runs to the top of a high staircase where the knife-wielding guy follows.  Two things are hilarious about this scene.  One is the guy who runs in with a bow and arrow, fires, but has no effect so the bad guy simply walks down the stairs and stabs him to death.  Two is when the knife is knocked from the guy's hands by Cecile, and we see four different camera angles showing the knife falling down the middle of the room, lol.  Old horror at its silliest!  Then again this movie came out one month before I was born so I better not call it old, lol.

There doesn't seem to be much emphasis on studying for this final exam, or even taking it for that matter.  Just Cecile and the nerdy doing a bit of studying.  Of course given the pranks going on, some of them *try* to study but find themselves the victim of bullying and can't.  I say the final death scene is lame, but they ALL are actually.  The only one I like is the punk kid named ""Wildman"" getting tossed around in the gymnasium.  This is the only exciting death scene.  Wow and I thought he was tough!  I guess not now.  The others are lame.  The nerdy kid with his head stuck in a door?  The guy hanging upside down in a locker (actually this is Wildman).  The girl who runs to the top of a tower, turns around screaming when she suspects something is wrong and dies behind the building wall?  Lame!

I really enjoy the soundtrack though.  The movie begins with two teens making out in a car (wow, so predictable!) and the girl feels uneasy because she keeps hearing noises (predictable again!) and we hear a piano line that closely resembles Mike Oldfield's ""Tubular Bells"", the famous main theme from the Exorcist.  Of course it's a cliched for horror films to take a melody similar to that one and alter it slightly.  Makes me wonder if it actually *is* Tubular Bells.  If not, how can so many musician get away with almost stealing it?  The piano melody afterwards is really pretty though!  The one that plays when we see the inside of the college, and more elegantly again during the credits.  Sure it sounds like early 80's Alan Parsons Project a bit, but that's a solid band!

Overall Final Exam is okay.  The story is split between fraternity pranks for the first half and bland deaths for the second half.  The characters feel kinda rushed and average.  The guys come across as typical party animals.  The girls are a little better, but it's odd Cecile plays such a big role.  The acting's not that great either.  The bad guy is just somebody showing up and stabbing for no good reason.  I barely recommend this.",1496188800,,5869,4.464655984919887
