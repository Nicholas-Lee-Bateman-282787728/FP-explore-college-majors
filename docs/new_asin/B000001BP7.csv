1175258,5,B000001BP7,"The release of the 1966 D'Oyly Carte Opera production of The Mikado on DVD in 2003-2004 was a capital idea. Gilbert and Sullivan fans have been waiting years for the classic film to appear on DVD. VAI (Video Artists International) offers many fine and rare operas on film. Gilbert and Sullivans' light operas were the signature of the D'Oyly Carte Opera and in the 60's this cast was the leading performers of the genre. Tenor Phillip Potter portrays Nanki Poo, the son of the Mikado disguised as a wondering minstrel. His performance is top-notch and Valerie Masterson, the soprano singing the part of Yum-Yum is his perfect counterpart. Together, they make beautiful music as in their duets. The comic actor John Reed sings Ko-Ko the Lord High Executioner. A short, playful and silly man, he's far from the expected strong and fearsome image of a Lord High Executioner. Christene Palmer is Katisha. Her commanding presence, dramatic mezzzo soprano voice and imperious nature make her the perfect Katisha. She's got some powerful scenes, such as the Act I Finale in which she interrupts the Wedding of Yum Yum and Nanki Poo and threatens to reveal his true identity, operatically dramatic in her cries ""My Wrongs With Vengeance Shall Be Crowned !"". Donald Adams plays The Mikado Emperor. He's at his silliest in the aria ""My Object All Sublime"" in which he lets out a high pitched shriek as he describes his fascination for torture and execution. The authenticity of the mood and setting, a Japan of fable and art, is gloriously manifested in the scenery, which gives off a Japanese ""Floating World"" look and the props, bridges, lakes, tea houses, aesthetically classical in space and shape. And those costumes ! Exquisite and very Oriental with colorful patterns on the silk. And the use of fans was almost over-the-top, the characters closing and opening their fans in Japanese poses, but still it works effectively. All the great numbers that made this opera famous are here- ""Three Little Maids from School"" and Ko-Ko's List Song. Coincidentally, this was the same production that inspired the crazed Zodiac Serial Killer who was fond of twisting the Lord High Executioner's image. He even re-wrote the lyrics to Ko-Ko's List Song. This is the best version of The Mikado ever made. It's worth the price and has value because of its camp classic appeal.",1085529600,35,2357,4.9395465994962215
1175259,5,B000001BP7,"This is it. The classic 1966-67 D'Oyly Carte Opera production of Gilbert and Sullivan's The Mikado. No other production holds a candle next to the superior performance of this movie. Back in the 60's, a talented cast of singers were performing all the classics of the Gilbert and Sullivan light operas under the direction of Bridget D'Oyly Carte and conductor Isodore Godfrey. They were John Reed, who performed all the comedic, fast-voiced baritone roles (Ko-Ko on here) Major General Stanley in Pirates of Penzance and Sir Joseph Porter in H.M.S. Pinafore, lyric tenor Phillip Potter, who was charming and romantic in a matinee idol sort of way (Nanki Poo on here, also sang Frederick in Pirates Of Penzance), Valerie Masterson, the coloratura and lyric soprano who played all the leading ladies (Yum Yum, Josephine in H.M.S. Pinafore, and Mabel in Pirates Of Penzance)
Donald Adams (The Mikado, The Pirate King) and Christene Palmer, who played all the mezzo soprano roles (Katisha, Buttercup and Ruth). These singers are at the top of their game on this film,
their voices are fresh and the performance is to die for. Phillip Potter is romantic as the minstrel son of the Mikado, Donald Adams is regial, Christene Palmer is an imperious and vengeful dragon lady, Valerie Masterson is sweet, youthful and charming as Yum-Yum. John Reed is as comical as ever. The Mikado is delivered here in the manner of Kabuki Japanese theatre. It really works. The authentic kimono wardrobe, music and poses from the actors gives the whole thing an artsy Japanese look. In addition, the camera doesn't move much, giving this a very staged and museum-style feel. Even if some say its campy, it doesn't diminish its value. It's a classic film that all Gilbert and Sullivan fans have to watch.",1082937600,73,1779,4.953177257525083
1175260,4,B000001BP7,"I grew up with the 1939 version of the Mikado (my parents had a recording) and I was quite used to the good quality of singing in that version.  This one brings it to life.  Compared to the 1939 version I've seen on film, this one is fresh, less stagy and Koko doesn't run over all the other actors.  It was refreshing to hear everyone who was supposed to sing certain songs actually perform them.  I still like the 1939 version for the lovely old tenor voices (and Katasha is a real dragon in that one!), but I prefer this one to listen to for purity of tone, good voices throughout and clarity.",1082160000,14,596,4.247787610619469
1175261,5,B000001BP7,"This is an excellent video of a very straightforward, conservative, and traditional staging of the Mikado. It does not have any of the lack of confidence that some video productions seem to have in trying to make a stage production seem to be anything more than it ought to be; it is as if the camera is very unobtrusively moving around in a traditional stage production.  This is a good way of doing things; there are no ""stupid camera tricks"" that interfere with the performance.
The characters in it are well played; Pooh Bah and Koko are especially fine performances.
Some more recent video productions have been ""over the top"", relying on unusual staging (like setting it in 1930's England); this video is a good baseline version of the opera by which others can be judged as there is no fooling around with it; just the opera delivered as it was more or less intended.",1005177600,16,874,4.638709677419355
1175262,5,B000001BP7,"I have a hard time saying anything negative about the 1966 version I just saw...yes, it does cut the ""Knightsbridge"" reference (otherwise known as the ""wherever"" line...) or its equivalent, and the whole ""song of the sea"" section of ""Wandering Minstrel"" seems to have bit the dust, as well.  But I think that was it, as far as omissions...oh, yes, they left out the second verse of the madrigal.
I don't understand the omissions at all.  What's the problem with saying ""London,"" or ""Cleveland,"" or ""Pensacola?""  What's the problem with 4 extra minutes of film?  Whatever.
The color was a little toned down and the music was occasionally ""tinny"" to my ear.  But the performances and makeup that I've heard disparaged elsewhere did NOT affect my enjoyment of the proceedings one whit.
The voices were great, and I absolutely LOVED Reed.  I would say Pish-Tush seemed a little...I don't know...plastic?  His voice was good, but it's almost like his look seemed more like he'd been filmed in the 30's.  Don't ask me why I say that.  I suppose he just reminded me of someone.
Anyway, having seen the Canadian, over-the-top version and the series from PBS wherein Clive Revill played Ko-Ko, I can only say I MUCH prefer this 1966 version.  It's like a time-warp and, given that most of us living can't really judge whether or not the company was in decline, or as good as it was in 1932 or 1886, this seems so much more a TREASURE.
Pitti-Sing had, for me, the oddest resemblance to Anna Quayle (sic); just a random thought.  The comic schtick and close-ups never bothered me.  I played ""The Mikado"" in 1986 and am about to play ""Ko-Ko"" in a month down the road.  It's great to get a feel for ""the real thing,"" although I don't intend to cannibalize the various tapes like the recent Nashville production did.  Whoosh.
I loved Reed's threat to commit seppuku, whereupon the ""knife"" was revealed as a fan.  I think our spin on it may be my jumping into our river (a real goldfish pond) which, of course, will be about 6 inches deep.  Should get a laugh.
By the way, back to the close-ups that I also saw belittled elsewhere...how the hell do these people EXPECT a play to be filmed?  I want to see what the individuals AND groups were doing...I thought it was perhaps a little overdone - yet still effective - on ""I Am So Proud.""
In short, I'm going to watch it again when I wake up tomorrow (or, technically, later today).
Somewhere I saw a review in which some guy said he used this tape to introduce his kids to G&S and they hardly made it through 40 minutes.  What did he expect out of kids, anyway?  What kind of comment IS that?  Unless they're rocket scientists at age 6, just introduce them to the music and wean them ONTO G&S.  They'll be glad you did.  I wouldn't have enjoyed it either...as a kid.  But I love it now.
As is evidenced by my willingness to don that hot kimono for several hours at a whack.
So, anyway, get the tape and prepare to enjoy yourself.  If that Canadian Pooh-Bah was too much for you, and if William Conrad's inability to move seemed distracting...well, you're in for a middle-of-the-energy-road treat...from THE G&S company.
And the rest of you stop looking gift horses in the mouth.  Or, for that matter, anywhere ELSE.",989625600,23,3249,4.550774526678141
1175263,5,B000001BP7,"I have been a lover of the light operas of Gilbert & Sullivan for many years, and this filmed stage production of the best of those light operas is as close as one could come to being there and yet not be there! This production stars the D'Oyly Carte Light Opera Company towards the end of their greatest years but still starring some of the greatest members of that Company's history! John Reed as ""Ko-Ko"", the hapless Lord High Executioner, is a joy to both see and listen to; Kenneth Sandford as the Lord High Everything Else ""Pooh-Bah"" is perfect in the role that might have been made for him; Donald Adams is the ultimate Mikado, especially in his signature song ""My Object All Sublime""; Philip Potter is a marvelous ""Nanki-Poo""; and Valerie Masterson is as charming, demure and beautiful a ""Yum-Yum"" as one could wish, especially in performing ""The Sun Whose Rays"", one of the most beautiful songs Gilbert & Sllivan ever wrote. The sets and costumes for this filmed stage production are as historically accurate as a purist could ever wish for, and not a single line of dialogue is changed, altered, or updated (another joy for G&S purists).
If you're just starting to learn about Gilbert & Sullivan, this is the very (indeed ONLY!!!) video to start off with.  A must for any lover of G&S, of light opera, of true theatre, or for a truly classic video collection!",973123200,36,1369,4.6570247933884295

Nobody can be better or funnier than John Reed as Koko  I'll have to see about getting ""Pirates of Penzance"", another favorite: with the same cast.

1175266,5,B000001BP7,"Unlike the corrupt 1939 movie version, this is the definitive record of a D'Oyly Carte production, at least circa 1952-1966. I was in American Savoyards in 1952, when Richard Walker, a former D'Oyly Carte Pooh-Bah, staged the Mikado for us, and again in 1954, when Radley Flynn (D'Oyly Carte, 1928-1951) staged two productions for the company, on Broadway, then in Maine. There was very little variation in the 1966 movie staging, except that some good comic business we were given had apparently been excised. Adams is the definitive Mikado; his laugh is indeed derived from a Kabuki play about an evil Shogun. Masterson's Yum-Yum is superb, as is the Pitti-Sing, and this Pooh-Bah is a picture of corruption much as Leo McKern might have given us, if he could only sing. John Reed is not the athlete and pyrotechnician Martyn Green was, but he is indearing in a sparrow-like way. One quibble: why do the maids have sideburn spitcurls?",1349654400,3,936,4.8930817610062896

1175269,2,B000001BP7,"Having watched this, I unfortunately couldn't pick any of these actors
out of a group, as this production is filmed from a fixed position too
far away from the stage.  It's like being present for the performance
and sitting in a bad seat.  You're way too distant from the action, and
facial features, costume details, etc, are indistinct.  The voices are
nice, especially Pooh Bah and Katisha, but the sound is inconsistant, and
it's sometimes difficult to hear and understand what is being said or
sung.  I think that if I were not so very familiar with The Mikado, I
would not be entirely sure what is going on.  I have every other production
available on DVD, and I would rank this at or near the bottom of the list.",1297555200,2,719,4.5
1175270,2,B000001BP7,"Purchased this DVD as I had seen the movie many years ago, unfortunately the colours were all faded which was disappointing.  This is my favourite G&S Operetta and after seeing the original movie and the D'Oly Carte production here in Melbourne the lack of colour was a shame the music and performances are still very good so if you like G&S you may want to find a copy that is more up to date.",1253664000,2,394,4.324324324324325
1175271,3,B000001BP7,"I'd have enjoyed the live performance quite a lot, but the DVD recording of the Madison Savoyards' ""The Mikado"" is merely mediocre.

The sound quality leaves much to be desired, with the leading singers' voices occasionally dropping off to virtually inaudible, while thumps and stomps on the stage come through with a distracting volume.

The fixed camera frame takes in a generally cluttered stage from a single angle, and with no close-ups.  The effect is, well, monotonous.

The performance itself is solid -- but not great.  Kathleen Buttita's rendition of Katisha is convincing, and even moving, while James Kryshak gives us a credible Nanki-Poo, and Anthony Ashley does Pooh-Bah justice.  But  Bert Adams's performance as the Mikado falls short of the imperial grandeur that one could reasonable hope for.  Donovan Armbruster's Ko-Ko, though competent, is executed with little feeling.

Other recordings of ""The Mikado"" are far superior to this one.  The Stratford Festival's, for example, (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gilbert-Sullivan-The-Mikado-Donkin-Saks-Stratford-Festival/dp/1569383464/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gilbert & Sullivan - The Mikado / Donkin, Saks, Stratford Festival</a>) or even Jonathan Miller's unorthodox production featuring Eric Idle as Ko-Ko.

The Madison Savoyards' ""The Mikado"" is worth buying if you know someone in the cast.  And it may be worth your time if you feel compelled to compare a variety of productions of Gilbert & Sullivan's greatest work.  But I think you'll agree, it's by no means the best.",1250985600,6,2048,6.9221789883268485
1175272,5,B000001BP7,"I actually bought this as a gift for my mother.  She had been looking for it.  We checked Amazon and there it was!  We've watched it a few times already and love it!

1175273,1,B000001BP7,This DVD recording of the Mikado has poor quality to the point of not being able to hear and understand the words on good speaker systems.  It seems the original analog recording was simply moved to different media.,1199750400,2,215,4.657894736842105
1175274,4,B000001BP7,"Despite problems in sound transfer and of color fading, this is, hands down, still the best available filmed version of Gilbert and Sullivan's delightful comic opera. As others have pointed out, the D'Oyly Carte cast is consistently impressive, including among its principals Valerie Masterson, who went on to a career of some distinction in grand opera, sweet voiced Philip Potter, and those excellent comic patter singers John Reed and Donald Adams. Further, except for the truncated overture, this production saves all of Sullivan's wonderful music and most of Gilbert's witty lyrics and dialogue, both of which are to varying degrees maimed in other versions.

In my view this production does have a serious flaw, though, which should be emphasized: it is essentially not a film, but rather just a stage play filmed in a studio without the inspiring presence of a live audience. It is afflicted, as a consequence, with a peculiar deadness. Watching it, this viewer felt as if he were seeing a theatrical dress rehearsal at which the audience had been asked to sit on its hands. Real audience laughter, applause and even demands for encores after musical numbers might have inspired the actors to better timing and to being more on top of their form during the filming, thus bringing the project successfully to life. Unfortunately, though, no matter what they do or sing, the actors are rewarded here with only a deadly, unvarying silence, the end result of which is to throw the whole project out of kilter.

Still as a record of an incomparable theatrical troupe in its last years, this performance remains a treasure of sorts.",1198800000,8,1633,5.0

That is not a bad thing, because most of the performances are excellent, and the traditions of the D'Oyly Carte are well, if not perfectly, preserved. Edited dialog is well noted. What IS bad is that these excellent performances come across as they've been stamped out and done over and over again a thousand times.  I don't quite know why, but it is just a feeling I get. Nevertheless, the singing is suburb and the comedy is well-timed.  The scene, for instance, of the Mikado confronting the three fake executioners is beyond hilarious.  I grew up on D'Oyly carte recordings, and I was in school when I saw this in an art theater, back in 1966.  I loved it wildly then, and I still enjoy it.

1175280,5,B000001BP7,"I gave this version 5 stars primarily because it is a film production of an actual stage presentation of The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, featuring its foremost stars of the 1960s, and displaying to good advantage the opera's beautiful sets and costumes. Consequently, it is essential viewing for loyal Savoyards and new comers.  The first major problem is that the video format (VHS and DVD) betrays the original wide-screen version. Then, too, the director was obviously oblivious as to where to point the camera and when to use medium and close-up shots . . . and I'm referring to the wide-screen original.  Consequently, significant bits of business in the wide-screen original are lost in long shot, and even more so in the pan and scan video edition.  Viewing the theatrical original when it premied in the 1960s was a painful experience for all who had the good fortune of attending an

actual D'Oyly Carte performance.  And, of course, it's true the cast is somewhat weary . . .  Nanki Poo seemingly a bit too old for the part (possibly owing to bad make-up and tight close-ups); Koko and Katisha mechanically going through the moves without much feeling, though they rally a bit towards the end of their duet.  The unenthusiastic performances I blame on the director and Miss. Bridget D'Oyly Carte, who should have known better. We must encourage the distributor to offer the wide-screen original from the best colour print (it was absolutely gorgeous on its theatrical release).",1128643200,26,1487,4.947791164658635
1175281,3,B000001BP7,"I suspect this was an excellent performance, based solely on the fact that it was D'Oyly Carte in the 1960s, it looks expertly performed, and it's received excellent reviews.  But... the sound on this DVD is like ""two cats in a sack"", and the video isn't so great either. Maybe the VHS version is loads better, but you have to be a dedicated fan to want to watch this.

If you have the lyrics memorized it might be comprehensible, as I was able to mostly follow along after finding a text copy of the lyrics/dialogue on the web. The first time I tried to watch it, I listened for about five minutes, realized I had no idea what the *#&@! they were saying, and started looking for other resources beacuse otherwise I was going to return it. No subtitles, more's the pity.

Frankly, it sounds like a typical Frumpies album: literally taped in someone's bathroom. It's musical, but with a ton of echo... maybe this was originally filmed in mono? The audio stream claims to be 2-channel Dolby. Impressively awful, whatever it is.

As for the video, it looks like it was filmed in Ektachrome, exposed to UV light for about twenty years, then soaked in water for another twenty. My inexpert guess is that it was actually filmed in Technicolor and not preserved very well, and whoever did the DVD transfer either did it from a poor VHS copy (unlikely) or didn't try to do any restoration/enhancement to the film transfer. A bit grainy, but the worst problem by far is the washed-out colors; everyone looks like they've been living in a cave, wearing the same clothes, for the last 40 years. Odd flashes of color, but it's mostly drab.

I recommend this one, but only because the vast majority of G&S video productions are horrid things guaranteed to induce agony and irritation. All of them (and I *do* mean all of them) have major problems. This one is the least wretched because the quality of the performance makes up for not being able to understand or really see it.

Frankly, I have given up on the idea of ever seeing a truly enjoyable Gilbert & Sullivan production. I am unlikely to see a decent live performance. Nobody's going to film a new one ""straight"" because that would require effort, and only a few people these days would want to see it. Most modern versions have been heavily rewritten and the older ones are poorly filmed or badly performed.

There is a definite mushiness about the audio that makes it extremely difficult to understand anything. The audio is not well synced with the video.  This is especially noticeable in close-ups. The graininess of the picture makes me think that this DVD was made from a copy of the original that was photocopied 27 times before I got it.",1104105600,23,709,4.543307086614173
1175283,5,B000001BP7,"The G&S 1966 D'Oyly-Carte Mikado has a way of lifting my spirits and making me want to sing all the time.  I printed all the lyrics and play it over and over and am learning to sing the songs.  They're really complicated and hard to get right.  I think that Sullivan was a brilliant composer, top notch, second to none.  Indeed, the influence of Strauss and Mozart are often quite evident in this opera; and yet there's also a way that the music and songs transcend their derivative nature, and all in such a humorous, zestful, tuneful way.  The words, though, well sometimes that's another story; but I like the plots and the characters so much that flaws and over-adherence to some conventions can be easily forgiven.

My fave in this version of The Mikado is John Reed as Koko.  He's so cute and funny.  Except for some funny double-jointed dancing and skipping by Reed's Koko,  I noticed that there's not much fun dancing in this 1966 version, as there seems to have been originally if we can go by the actors in Topsy-Turvy... but the producers more than made up for it with sets, costuming, characters, and scenery, and with excellent acting that pays attention to subtle reactions to plays on words, like the time Nanki-Poo says, early on, that he knew that Yum-Yum was betrothed to Koko, the chief tailor, so his ""suit"" wouldn't show much promise.  Just at that moment, amid all the hubbub and fast paced movement and dialogue, Pish-Tush whips his head around in a very quick doubletake.  I also was pleased to see that the racist lines using the n-word were removed; in fact, I think the opera was shortened by about a half an hour.  But it doesn't matter; it's just a great and lavish production with top notch singers and great actors who fit their characters.",1093564800,11,1771,4.6050955414012735

7902005,3,B000001BP7,"I saw this production with the identical cast in 1967in Los Angeles, and although I had no knowledge of G & S or any of the Savoy operettas I became an instant fan, and have remained one until this day.
I actually saw this filmed version sometime in the early 70s and loved it.  I remember seeing in in a wide screen version.
This DVD is made from a poor print of the film and is faded and drab looking.
I would love to see a new release of this with a cleaner print and in wide screen format (and better sound).
As far as I can tell, this is the one and only full performance of a savoy operetta available by the D'oyly Carte company on video other than the
filmed version from the 1930s, and for that reason it is worth having for those who love these pieces or were lucky enough to have seen the
D'oyly Carte company before it was disbanded in the 80s.",1428969600,3,855,4.089285714285714
7902006,5,B000001BP7,"In order to introduce a friend to The Mikado I viewed all the DVD versions I could find and chose this one.  The less-than-sharp picture and limited staging were far outweighed by the authenticity and the wonderful quality of the singing.  The words were sharp and clear, easy for my friend to hear and understand.  I saw other versions that were too silly, or had offensive ethnic references, or had mediocre voices.  It had just the right amount of humor, too -- especially Koko's bits.",1426982400,4,488,4.705882352941177
