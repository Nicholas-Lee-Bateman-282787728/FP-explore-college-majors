3185,5,0740325124,"My wife found all of Tonya Larson to be very helpful in getting back to shape with a newborn.  The routine was challenging but nothing she couldn't manage after a few weeks postpartum.  My favorite part is the spiritual warmups.  I watched them and was super impressed.  As a pastor I see all kinds of spiritual nonsense but her message was refreshing and accurate.  For the right person, it could even be life changing.",1343174400,,420,4.621621621621622
3186,5,0740325124,"Thanks Tonya for a lovely stretching and toning routine. It is a very relaxing workout and the music is lovely. Yes, it is a Christian-centered workout with soft Christian vocals and instrumental music. I am a Christian, so I was very familiar with the lyrics and tunes. They were very modern versions and had a nice ambiant feel to them. I love all of Tonya's workouts and appreciate her Spiritual Warm-Ups and everything about her routines. This was a yoga-based routine, but she used no yoga terminalogy in describing the moves. It was very professional. I do, however enjoy a lot of yoga routines that do use the authentic yoga/sanskrit names and words. I love Raviana workouts too. Tonya is very professional, and soft-spoken and the set,music and the mats and their outfits were nice and modern. I really like this one and you can use it in segments or do the whole thing!",1340841600,6,878,4.707792207792208
3187,5,0740325124,Good workout.  I love it!  It is a very good stretch and muscle building workout with the bonus of a christian worshipful aspect.,1339891200,,129,4.565217391304348
3188,2,0740325124,"The title on this exercise DVD does not really match the actual content. ""Yoga-Lite for Biblical Worship after Childbirth"" may be a better title.

Tonya leads a gentle, soft yoga practice (not powerful as in the title) geared towards intermediate practitioners. There is not a lot of sculpting performed in the practice, although her Yoga routine can provide some toning. She provides very little instruction or beginner options so I would not recommend it if you're looking for a beginner's stretching routine. For instance, during Chaturanga (slow downward movement plank), she does not give the option to lower your knees first, then goes into the full upward dog position. She does bridge pose (an advanced yoga posture) with very little instruction and poor form.

Also, if you're looking for a non-demoninational practice, this is not the DVD for you. She talks specifically about God, Jesus, and Repenting and includes quotes from the bible during what's called the ""Spritual Warm-Up"", which assumes all spiritual practitioners believe in God and follow the Bible. It felt more like a sermon/lecture to me. This turned me off, specifically since it's marketed as a regular ""stretching"" video.

The practice is somewhat weak, Tonya's voice is too soft and she does not provide clear enough queues so you have to look up quite often to follow her routine. Moveover, the music is too load and has church-based singing which even more overpowers her delicate voice.

The introduction video section has Tonya and her single student showing their new babies. It is commendable that they both just gave birth and have made a video. All the proceeds go to ""Acres 4 Life"" which helps people in Africa learn to farm their land, which is awesome! I really appreciate their efforts and work helping people with their loving kindness, but again, it would be better to be straight forward in their marketing that their efforts have religious undertones. It's not that I don't support them, but they should be clear on the cover of the DVD that the proceeds will be used for religious-based projects.

If you're looking for a couple excellent (non-demoninational) well produced stretching DVD's, I would recommend the following:

I like that it's divided into several different stretch sequences, so if I don't have time to do the entire video I can pick which one or two sequences I want to do. When I first started , I could barely bend because of my back and the condition my muscles were in at the time.

I finished the video regardless and found the stretches to be nice and relaxing (and that is the ONLY reason it is getting two stars) but I agree with other commenters that ""power"" and ""sculpt"" have no business being in the title and description.

Also - to other commenters that were complaining that yoga doesn't fit their religion -- well -- yoga is an Indian lifestyle practice. It's more than just exercises and poses to them. If you are going to partake - have some respect and appreciation for something outside of your comfort zone.
