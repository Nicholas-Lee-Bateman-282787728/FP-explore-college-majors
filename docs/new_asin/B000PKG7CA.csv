2824234,4,B000PKG7CA,"""Crime Wave"" is excellent example of film noir: almost everything you'd want in this genre. Right from the opening shot, this had noir written all over it by cinematographer Bert Glennon, and from opening holdup-murder scene at the gas station, you knew you were in for a rough ride.

Speaking of ""rough,"" I can't think of too many actors who were better and more suited for noir than Sterling Hayden, who delivers yet another uncompromising hard-headed, tough- guy character. This time he's a cop, ""Det. Lt. Sims,"" and one with no use for any ""con,"" even if the guy (in this case, Gene Nelson's ""Steve Lacey"") has cleaned up his act.

It wasn't just the photography and Haden, the entire cast was fascinating, and it's simply a fast-moving, entertaining film. Andre de Toth's direction also was terrific. He directed only one other noir: Pitfall, another great film that we are still waiting to see on DVD. At least this film finally made it to disc.

As for Decoy, it gets points for originality. I mean, how many movies - much less film noirs - do you see someone executed, then brought back to life, then shot in the back minutes later? Now that's what you call having a rough day!

Robert Armstrong's ""Frank Olins"" had to endure all that one day. He's the crook who has the money stashed away somewhere and ""Margot Shelby"" (Jean Gille) is the woman who is bound-and-determined to get it - all of it. ""Margot"" is one greedy femme fatale...... and she knows how to manipulate men. Of course it helps to be extremely pretty and have a great body, which she does. I thought the ending of this film - the final minute - was especially good. So many times, you get the ending that doesn't stay true to the main character, but this one did.

If you don't want to buy the whole Film Noir Volume 4 package, of which this is part of, I would suggest getting this disc.",1188950400,9,1863,4.516320474777448
2824235,5,B000PKG7CA,"Being a fan of film  noir....and a fan of Sterling Hayden, Charles Bronson, and dancer Gene Nelson...I'd seen this little film show up in all their filmographies...without much mention.

Just watched the new DVD...as part of the Excellent Film Noir vol. 4 set by Warner Bros...and was blown away!

1)tight story..only about 74 minutes...no filler
2)Sterling Hayden is great..hard boiled , hard bitten , toothpick chomping!
3)the supporting  cast...is perfect...Charles Buchinsky(pre Bronson)is a presence and Timothy Carey's small role defines scenery chewing..
4)the LA locations of 1952 are super cool
5)the cinematography is first rate...and the transfer dead sharp!

the bonus featurette is informative and the commentary by Eddie  Muller (noir historian and  author) and the great James Ellroy....is simply the most fun commentary I have EVER enjoyed ...and I own  a couple thousand  DVDs...
these guys know  the  turf...are fans and Ellroy is bleeped for his blue language over and over ...just ridiculous.

The director Andre De Toth and cinematographer Burt Glennan deserve High Praise...this was kick butt..
and pretty boy Dancer Gene Nelson (from Oklahoma and Doris Day movies) is  a very credible pre-James Dean getaway driver...stool pigeon..",1186012800,12,1254,5.536842105263158
2824256,4,B000PKG7CA,"These are two very good noir films, not as good as some classics like Out Of The Past or In A Lonely Place, but still interesting in plot and atmosphere. The acting is satisfactory but not great. The lead actress in Decoy, Jean Gillie, does a fine job as the femme fatale; unfortunately, she died of pneumonia a few years later or she would have had a decent career. I recommend this noir package to viewers who are noir afficionados.",1358985600,,434,4.4375
2824257,5,B000PKG7CA,"""Crime Wave"" is a good, solid, moody cop and crime flick from the 1950s.  It is loaded with dark, shadowy night shots from the Los Angeles of the era.  Has any city been better for films of this nature?  The story has it that director de Toth sought out LAPD for advice on shooting locales.  And there is even a shot of a red street car!

The main characters are Gene Nelson as an ex-con trying to go straight.  His no-nonsense wife, Phyllis Kirk is right by his side. His old gang, led by a smarmy Ted de Corsia, tries to drag Nelson back into a life of crime. They have the ""perfect set up""- a bank job in Glendale.  The leading LAPD detective is a perfectly cast Sterling Hayden, a cop with a tough exterior indeed but with a slightly softer heart.

""Crime Wave"" incorporates fine police backgrounds, gloomy interrogation rooms, cynical detectives leaning on informers, Hayden leaning on dicks he out ranks, leather-jacketed cops on night patrol and the constant staccato of radio chatter. Those calm female LAPD dispatchers deserve high praise.  The supporting cast shines-including James Bell as Nelson's parole officer and Jay Novello as a ""veterinarian""- not to mention the dogs in his kennel.  There is also a great cameo by Nelson's work supervisor- the veteran Hank Worden (Mose Harper in John Ford's classic ""The Searchers"").

This review is avoiding any mention at the resolution.  It comes soon enough. deToth has packed so much into a tight 73 minute run time. No one will be bored. Somehow 43 characters pass before us in that brief span. ""Crime Wave"" is a wonderful return to gloomy, no nonsense 50s crime/noir with an old pro at the helm and a veteran cast going through its paces.

""Decoy"" is eerie-even by film noir standards!  The film is based on hidden loot and a grifting woman's efforts to get her hands on it.  The role of the femme fatale is played to perfection by Jean Gillie.  Her Google site informs us that she got her movie start by playing comedy roles!  The action unwinds by flashback after JG is shot by someone with a small grudge against her.

A good review won't even try to divulge the resolution but this viewer thought the ending was telegraphed early in the movie.  That is ""Decoy's"" major weakness.  Its strong point is the fast developing plot in a 76 minute run time.  No one will be bored here either. Another strong point is that ""Decoy"" is included on the same disc with the far superior ""Crime Wave.  Stay along for the ride and enjoy both.

An interesting thought: How would Detective Sterling Hayden have handled Gillie?",1343692800,4,2572,4.6415929203539825
2824258,5,B000PKG7CA,"The best film noir double feature I have ever seen. And yes I would say these unknown films are better as a double feature than almost any two better-known noirs.

""Crime Wave"": awesome location 1950's filming, realism, and Sterling Hayden at his best.

2824259,4,B000PKG7CA,"I really liked the movies ""crimewave"" and ""Decoy"". In the movie crimewave with sterling hayden and gene nelson.sterling hayden plays a cop who uses ex-con nelson to capture nelsons old buddies that killed a policeman at a gas station and are running away from the law. a young charles bronson plays one of the fugitives. And always good badguy ted de corsia (from ""the ""enforcer with humphrey bogart and "" The lady from shanghai"" with orson welles and rita hayworth)plays the other fugitive. I thought the movie ""crimewave"" was good but pretty predictable. The other movie ""Decoy"" I liked too. It was about a very pretty but evil lady (jean gillie)who has a boyfriend robert armstrong(from king kong;1933 version)who kills a brinks truck driver and is set to die in the gas chamber. armstrong buries the treasure but before he is executed jean gillie thinks of a plan with gangster boyfriend and lover doctor to bring him back alive and collect the buried treasure. Decoy did have far fetched happenings in it but I really Enjoyed it. both movies I would reccommend. Tragically jean gillie in real life died of pneumonia a few years later  but she made a great femme fatale. I loved her.too bad her short life span gyped us out of more possible great roles like this. the movies ""crimewave"" and ""decoy"" are worth the money ,especially if you like film noir detective and gangster movies!",1273104000,,1387,4.803347280334728
2824260,4,B000PKG7CA,"CRIME WAVE (Andr de Toth 1954)
If you just look at the bare-bones descriptions on a lot of films noir, it can be pretty hard to tell them apart, and the typically minimalist titles sure don't help.  I thought I remembered seeing this solid entry years ago in a mini de Toth retrospective, but I was mistaken. It's a flavorful entry if nothing terribly original or memorable, notable for its harsh, verite-style lighting and camerawork, and excellent usage of Los Angeles locations; this is one of the best representations of 50s LA I've seen on film....and a really terrific cast, with Sterling Hayden and Charles Bronson the most well-known (respectively playing the cop in charge of finding a trio of escaped cons, and the most thuggish of the escapees) but hardly the only quality players. Gene Nelson as Steve Lacey, the ex-con trying to straighten out his life until it is intruded upon by one of the trio, dying in his living room, and Phyllis Kirk as his devoted wife do a fine job with relatively stereotypical roles; Dub Taylor and Jay Novello have nice, small character roles; and you'll even find crazy Timothy Carey playing a wide-eyed laughing maniac in a couple of scenes near the end.

The film does fall a little flat in the third act, with a fairly predictable ending that feels more positive and ""Hollywood"" than a great noir usually should; I don't know if the studio or somebody in a suit got in the way of a more downbeat and realistic ending, which I'd have expected from de Toth, but it's a nice entry and there aren't too many wasted moments in the 73-minute running time.  Fine transfer.

DECOY (Jack Bernhard 1946)
This gripping, mile-a-minute early noir reminded me of other low-budget, ""poverty row"" pictures of the era like Joseph H Lewis' DEADLY IS THE FEMALE aka GUN CRAZY in its boiling down of its doom and gloom storyline to essentials and its whip-like pacing that allows for little in the way of reflection on the various implausibilities in the thin plot.  Indeed, it was distributed by Monogram, which put out a lot of the toughest and cheapest films of the day (though not GUN CRAZY), and if it's not quite as memorable as Lewis' masterpiece, it's compelling enough in its own right. British actress Jean Gillie (married at the time to director Bernhard, whose career high point this has to be) is completely magnetic as the utterly amoral Margot, who will stop at nothing to retrieve a box with $400,000 that her boyfriend, now on death row for killing a cop, managed to stash after a robbery. Lying to a doctor to help him cheat death, to the boyfriend himself as she cheats on him with another member of the gang, she is definitely a ""piece of work.""

The most interesting aspect of the film is probably the blunt suddenness of the violence (which of course isn't shown in any real graphic detail; even the cheap studios had to keep it toned down); there aren't any niceties here, people just get bumped off because they're in the way. Solid supporting work by Sheldon Leonard as a cynical detective -- you probably will remember him better from the same year's IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (as Nick the bartender); the rest of the cast is fine as well though most are faces that will only be recognized by hardcore classics viewers.

Interestingly enough, the blacklisted screenwriter Nedrick Young wrote DECOY, and appears as an actor in CRIME WAVE.  All in all, not one of the absolute best in the Warner noir series - but still very much worth having.",1258243200,2,3490,4.672638436482084
2824261,4,B000PKG7CA,"DECOY is just a little gem. The plot strains credulity(as do the plots of many noirs) but Jean Gillie is a delight to watch as possibly the nastiest ""femme fatale"" in all of noir(with the possible exception of Ann Savage in, DETOUR). She murders people left and right and does it brutally and with glee---she's after $400,000 of stolen money. Sheldon Leonard plays a cop on the trail of the money. It's short and to the point---run time is 76 minutes. Worth a look---IMO.

CRIME WAVE is another movie I enjoy watching a lot. It stars Sterling Hayden(a favorite of mine), Gene Nelson, and Phyllis Kirk. Nelson is an ex-con trying to go straight but some of his old criminal cronies coerce him back into a ""caper"". Hayden is the hard-boiled cop who is after them. Also in the cast is one of my all-time favorite ""whacked-out"" character actors---Timothy Carey. He is really ""over the top"" in this one and steals every scene he's in. A guy by the name of Charles Buchinsky also has a minor role in the film---he later became better known as Charles Bronson. The film also has an audio commentary track with Eddie Muller and James Ellroy that is worth the price of admission in itself---Ellroy is funny as h/e/l/l!!! Another film well worth watching---IMO. It's a fast-paced one also---run time: 74 minutes.

2824262,4,B000PKG7CA,"Crime Wave is such a solid film noir, both in style and substance, that its rating cancels out the mediocre two-star feature that accompanies it on this double-bill dvd.
Crime Wave concerns an ex-con who, successfully going straight, gets caught in a cops/crooks squeeze when felon acquaintances pressure him to aid their escape.  Though the plot involves no crime wave in the usual meaning of the phrase, the title is apt in a psychological sense as the protagonist struggles to avoid being swamped by the foul deeds and bad breaks to which he and his wife fall victim.  The direction, with its flawless use of chiaroscuro and stark angles in on-location settings, has resulted in a film with a top-notch look and feel of noir.  The actors are all well suited to their roles, and they deliver fine performances.  At a little over 70 minutes, the movie has a precise, steady pace that allows for nary a dull moment.
Decoy opens with a scene of pure noir: a man shakily washing badly soiled hands in a filthy sink, grappling clumsily for a paper towel, leaving smears on the clean roll.  His stare is wild as he gapes into a jagged fragment of a mirror.  Then he turns, and it all goes down the drain.  Instead of the grimey, graffiti-smirched walls of a claustrophobic toilet, the enclosure is revealed to be a framework of pristine, bare-wood walls.  The man staggers forth into a flashback-related tale that has all the logic of a poorly written sci-fi feature.  The story's premise is pseudo-medical nonsense, and almost every action taken makes absolutely no sense and would be incomprehensible to the average person.  Most people, for instance, would not assume that a corpse stolen from a morgue wagon equals an executed criminal still alve and on the lam.  As bad as the silly script is, the direction is so out of sync with it that a purportedly squalor-ridden slum looks like a Beaver-Cleaver neighborhood, and a eucalyptus grove on a treasure map becomes one eucalyptus tree at the site.  It looks like a plot device when one character makes two trips to retrieve flat-tire-fixing tools and tosses the second load in the back seat.  But do cops subsequently see the lug wrench in plain view and connect the car's occupants to a freshly dead body just down the road?  No--these actions, plotwise, come to naught.  Apparently, this film was no more than a vehicle for the producer-director's wife, Jean Gillie.  A typically pretty woman, her character however exhibits nothing that makes for a femme fatale--neither striking beauty, sexiness, or savvy.  She simply struts into scenes, bedecked in fancy dresses and furs, and men melt.  (Even her main man, three hours from the gas chamber, gushes about her attire!)  The philanthropic physician she reels in has a sweet, lovely girlfriend with billowing blonde hair, yet Gillie merely swishes into his office and turns him into a zombie who commences to walk around with arms hanging at his sides and eyes that grow increasingly goggled as the plot progresses.  (The movie's real revenant manages at least one wise action!)  In stark contrast to Crime Wave, the sets appear to be on a movie lot, and the ubiquitous, hearts-and-flowers score is utterly incongruous with a murder-ridden plot driven by a malicious femme fatale.  The film deserves two stars simply because the actors are basically competent and the cinematography unshoddy.",1251676800,,3395,4.90893169877408
2824263,3,B000PKG7CA,"The header was the original name of the film.  Don't Cry Baby also made an appearance but in this DVD selection, it's Crime Wave.  Reviewers who are waxing poetic might be embellishing a bit.  This should be seen for the direction of Andre de Toth.  Shot in 13 days on a shoestring budget, his use of Los Angeles scenes seems documentary in style.  Very cool!

However, this movie is more a curio than must see.  Seeing Charles Bronson (credited as Charles Buchinsky) long before stardom is a kick.  Ted de Corsia as 'Doc' Penny, mob leader, nearly steals the film.  However, Sterling Hayden, as Detective Lieutenant Sims, is so bad he's almost comical.  Somebody should have fixed his clown tie.  Dub Taylor, of Western movies fame, also appears as a gas station employee in the beginning of the film.  Only two women with speaking lines are in the movie.  Phyllis Kirk handles her role with aplomb.  Pure joy watching Timothy Carey as Johnny Haslett doing his best, twitching, grinning hooligan.

Some stylish noir scenes including Kirk and Gene Nelson as Steve Lacey (former bad guy now straight) trying to decide whether they should pick up a late night phone call.  All done showing hands only. Crime Wave is a movie worth watching but let's not put it on a pedestal.  It's good but not a classic.",1236902400,,1302,4.6902654867256635
2824264,4,B000PKG7CA,"""Crime Wave"" (1954) and ""Decoy"" (1946) were made 8 years apart, one at the peak of the film noir cycle and the other at its end. Even so, they both have archetypal noir plots -a man wrongly accused and a femme fatale- that are straightforward and uncomplicated. The connection between them is Ned Young. He wrote ""Decoy"" from an unpublished story by Stanley Rubin, and he played a small part, that of the wounded crook Morgan, in ""Crime Wave"", which was actually completed in 1952 and shelved for 2 years. Both films run only about 1 hour and 15 minutes. And that is probably the extent of the similarities between them.

""Crime Wave"" is a Warner Brothers crime thriller shot in 2 weeks, whose workaday script is elevated by great Los Angeles locations, many shot at night, the spare style of director Andre De Toth, and the imposing presence of actor Sterling Hayden in a role less sensitive than audiences were accustomed to seeing him in. In contrast, ""Decoy"" is a murder drama made by the Poverty Row studio Monogram Pictures. It is pulp noir, compelling though never actually believable. Since its rediscovery, ""Decoy"" and its over-the-top villainess have acquired an iconic B-noir status comparable to Edgar G. Ulmer's ""Detour"" (1945). It doesn't have the visceral impact of ""Detour"", but ""Decoy""'s overbearing score and unredeemable femme fatale certainly make an impression.

""Crime Wave"" begins as 3 escaped convicts rob a Los Angeles gas station, killing a police officer in the process. One of the crooks, wounded himself, struggles to the apartment of a man he knew in prison years ago, Steve Lacey (Gene Nelson). Steve has gone straight and gotten married, and the last thing he wants is a hoodlum dying in his living room. But die he does, and hard-nosed homicide Detective Sims (Sterling Hayden) is sure that the man's accomplices will show up on Steve's doorstep too. Steve is afraid for the safety of his wife Ellen (Phyllis Kirk). But his former prison-mates, Doc Penny (Ted de Corsia) and Ben Hastings (Charles Bronson), won't take ""no"" for an answer when they insist that Steve be the getaway man on a bank heist.

""Decoy"" begins at the end, as a wounded man fatally shoots glamorous Margot Shelby (Jean Gillie). As she lay dying, Margot recounts the story of the mysterious box that she clutches to police Sgt. Joseph Portugal (Sheldon Leonard). Margot gets what she wants by seducing men, and what she wants is money. Boyfriend Frankie Olins (Robert Armstrong) hid $400,000 from a robbery and is soon to take the secret of its location to his grave. He is scheduled for execution. Margot seduces and threatens Dr. Lloyd Craig (Herbert Rudley) into administering an antidote to the cyanide gas to bring Frankie back to life. Her other lover, unscrupulous lawyer Jim Vincent (Edward Norris), will retrieve Frankie's body. And Frankie will tell them where the money is. At least that's the plan.

The DVD (Warner 2007): ""Crime Wave"" precedes ""Decoy"" on the disc. Bonus features for ""Crime Wave"" are a theatrical trailer, a featurette called ""Crime Wave: The City is Dark"" (6 min) that interviews critics and directors about Andre de Toth's style, and a feature commentary by film noir historian Eddie Muller and crime novelist James Ellroy. Ellroy knows LAPD history, and he adds color and panting to the commentary. They talk about locations, de Toth's style, the cast, and camera work. Bonus features for ""Decoy"" include the featurette ""Decoy: A Map to Nowhere"" (5 min) that interviews critics and writer Rubin about the film's production and cult status. There is a feature commentary by critic Glenn Erikson and writer Stanley Rubin. Much of the discussion is about Rubin's career and how he came to write the story for ""Decoy"". Also discussed are characters and people involved in the film's production. Subtitles available for both films in English SDH and French.",1220659200,5,3889,4.941896024464832
2824265,4,B000PKG7CA,"""You know, it isn't what a man wants to do, Lacey, but what he has to do. Now you take me. I love to smoke cigarettes, but the doctors say I can't have them. So what do I do? I chew toothpicks. Tons of `em.""

Developed as The City is Dark and shot as Don't Cry, Baby before being released as Crime Wave, Andre de Toth's still surprisingly tough police procedural is a film that wears its economy as a badge of pride. Offered a big budget and a 35-day shooting schedule if he made it with Humphrey Bogart and Ava Gardner, de Toth held out for Sterling Hayden even though it mean a fraction of the budget and a 15-day shooting schedule - and still managed to come in ahead and shoot the film in only 13 days. It was worth sticking to his guns. The film may have made little splash when it opened in 1954, but it's a near classic that fully deserves its growing reputation, and as the hardboiled cop who's all-knowing judge and jury, Hayden so effectively strides through the film like a colossus in a towering performance (literally: for much of the film he's shot from low angles) that it's impossible to imagine Bogart as being anything but a comparative disappointment in the role. The kind of guy who doesn't need doors because he can walk through walls, he doesn't act tough - he is tough. He's practically the blueprint for L.A. Confidential's Bud White, and it's no surprise that James Ellroy is a big fan of the film, sharing an entertaining, occasionally expletive-deleted audio commentary with Eddie Muller on Warner's Region 1 DVD.

The plot is simple enough: a trio of escaped cons (Ted de Corsia, Charles Bronson when he was still Charles Buchinsky and Ned Young) kill a cop when robbing Dub Taylor's gas station for eating money and involve innocent parolee Gene Nelson, leaned on by cops and crooks alike, in their escape plans. But the execution is what raises the bar here, particularly in the first third when the police bring in all the usual suspects. Shot in an almost verite documentary style, the film has a great look thanks to Bert Glennon's striking cinematography - deep focus, harsh blacks and bright fluorescent whites often sharing the same frame, with such a stark photojournalistic realism that some of the setups could pass for Weegee's classic crime scene photos. It captures the feeling of L.A. at night like almost no other film, with outstanding location work and an unforgiving eye for human weakness and hopeless cases. It certainly takes some of the shine off Kubrick's subsequent The Killing - it certainly got there first in terms of its look, and it's probably no accident that Kubrick hired two of the cast for his own caper movie.

While its undoubtedly Hayden's movie, the supporting cast is for the most part exceptionally strong and well-drawn. Nelson is convincing enough as the bitter ex-con caught in the middle that it's a shame that the former dancer didn't go on to anything more interesting than directing some of Elvis' worst movies, Phyllis Kirk makes more of an impression as his wife than the script would lead you to expect while Jay Novello makes a big impact as a drunken horse doctor who hates people but loves dogs and has no scruples about rifling a corpse's pockets for services not rendered. Not everyone is quite so good, unfortunately: Bronson overdoes his dumb thug and a wildly miscast Hank Worden is barely able to deliver his lines as Nelson's airport boss (is there anyone you'd feel less safe being in charge of airplane maintenance than Hank Worden?). As for Timothy Carey's truly amazing display of psychotic tics as the last guy in the world you'd want to leave your wife with - well, since all his directors maintained Carey was never acting but really was like that offscreen as well, we can let that slide.

The film does briefly give into sentimentality at the end - though very, very begrudgingly - and it's never quite as good as that powerhouse first third, but it's certainly a sharp punch below the belt to the cop movie that you won't forget in a hurry. Along with a brief adulatory featurette with various noir historians and Oliver Stone waxing lyrical about the film, the DVD also includes the original trailer introduced by an in-character Hayden telling us ""Murder is my business and midnight is my beat."" Great stuff.

Neither Decoy nor its short-lived star Jean Gillie are great rediscoveries waiting to happen, but this Monogram Poverty Row effort makes for a satisfying enough second feature. The plot is absurd - Gillie's displaced British femme fatale romances prison doctor Edward Norris into reviving Robert Armstrong an hour after his execution with `Methalyn Blue' so she and her partner in crime Herbert Rudley can find out where he buried $400,000 in stolen loot - but even by noir standards Gillie's character is stunningly ruthless as she destroys everyone in her path. But striking moments, such as Armstrong's dazed reaction to his own revival, are few and far between and aside from Sheldon Leonard's cop, charisma and acting ability are in similarly short supply. Norris is a disastrous lead, a zombie-like blank slate long before his character slips into near-catatonic shock for the last third of the film, while as his secretary the startlingly awful Marjorie Woodwarth gives a practical masterclass in the difference between acting and more or less remembering her lines. Still, there's a neat dying kiss off before the payoff and it doesn't outstay its welcome at a brisk 76 minutes.",1209686400,12,5497,4.7760252365930596

8192024,5,B000PKG7CA,"I first heard about ""Decoy"" in Alain Silver and Elizabeth Silver's ""Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style,"" and later in ""Death on the Cheap:The Lost B Movies of Film Noir!"" by Arthur Lyons. The film was considered ""lost"" for many years since it was a ""Poverty Row"" movie and had not been seen for many years. I read that it contained the sexiest and most deadly ""femme fatale"" of film noir, the lovely Margo Shelby played by British actress Jean Gillie, who died young of pneumonia. The plot is intriguing if somewhat absurd. Margo, a poor girl who became the moll of a gangster, hopes to find the $400,000 he robbed from an armored car. Sentenced to death for shooting the driver, Frankie Olins (Robert Armstrong) won't tell anyone where he hid the loot. He wants his second-in-command Edward Norris to hire him a better lawyer for his appeal, unaware that he and Margo are planning to double-cross him. They convince a doctor to use methelene blue to revive Frankie Olins after his execution in the gas chamber so they can get him to tell them where the money is hidden. The doctor also falls for Margo's considerable charms and the plan works! After Frankie draws a map, Norris shoots him. He and Margo now each have half of a map to the buried loot. Together with Dr. Rudley, the devious duo head out to the woods above San Francisco to seek out the buried treasure. Along the way, Margo fakes a flat tire and after Norris fixes it, she ruthless runs him over, then calmly puts away the jack. Rudley wants to kill her, but when she hands him Norris' revolver, he cannot bring himself to shoot her. He digs up the treasure and then lets Margo shoot him. Tough Cop Joseph ""Jojo"" Portugal, played by Sheldon Leonard is also under Margo's spell. He arrives at her apartment just after she's been shot by the dying Rudley and hears her confession. She mocks and humiliates him by laughing in his face before dying. He opens the ""treasure"" to find that Olins only left a one dollar bill to his betrayers and a note saying he left the rest of the money to the worms. One of the best film noirs I've seen, Jean Gillie's Margo is wonderfully evil and seductive. I loved a small bit of dialogue between her and Jojo. He says: ""Don't let that pretty face go to your head."" She responds by smiling at him and saying coldly: ""Or yours?"" Great mood lighting, convincing sets and props and an eerie music score all add to the tension, but Jean Gillie's acting steals the show. A fantastic noir. ""Crime Wave"" was also a ""Poverty Row"" production, but it is somewhat more predictable. A bank robbery planned from the inside goes wrong because the police are one step ahead of the robbers all the way. The acting was drab but the tension was good. A B- in my book compared to a very high A+++ for ""Decoy."" Well worth the price for two above average Film Noir movies.",1406160000,2,2873,4.495219885277247
8192025,5,B000PKG7CA,"I bought this movie specifically because it was shot all around Glendale, CA. The veterinary shop where much of the action takes place is on the corner of Alma and San Fernando Rd., directly across from 4over printing, where I work.

As a BONUS, it's a great movie. I really like Sterling Hayden in this movie. I recommend the movie for the movie, or for the views of Glendale!",1361664000,,377,4.463768115942029
8192026,5,B000PKG7CA,"For connoisseurs of over-the-top femmes fatales, Jean Gille is a must. The movie is about as campy as film noir gets. The DVD company seems to think ""Crime Wave"" is the main draw, but it's way too tasteful placed alongside ""Decoy"". This set is a ""don't-miss"" for all noir fans and anyone looking for a good laugh.",1361404800,3,313,4.508771929824562
