8183949,5,B000O7D76S,"Every DVD in the ""Ewe Know"" set is fantastic. Biblical principles like kindness, thankfulness, and honesty are taught without all the loud 'noise' of other animated videos. These are calming and very pleasant to listen to. If I remember correctly, each DVD has 3 or 4 sections to it with short songs included, and each part last about 15 to 20 minutes. So, instead of having the TV babysit for an hour or two, these are short so there's time for parents or grandparents to discuss them or give examples afterward. That way the Biblical concept is better remembered and exercised. I love these videos and will use them over and over again, and then probably pass them on to others who will.",1509235200,,689,4.609756097560975
8183950,5,B000O7D76S,"These Ewe Know videos are so cute!  The animation is terrific, the music is adorable and catchy and the story line is wonderful!  Your preschoolers and early elementary kids will love these videos --- and so will you!  Along with the story line, there is plenty of opportunity for you to explain  some of the lingo, jokes, etc to ones that might be too young to understand......some good conversations and learning opportunities can be generated from these videos.  Videos all have Christian themes and all touch on importance of having good morals, following directions, listening, obeying, etc.  Presented in an easy way for children to be able to follow AND stay interested in!  My little one started taking his shoes off when he came inside because that was talked about in the ""following rules"" section of the video.  He loves the wolves (the bad guys) as well as the sheep because the ""bad guys"" aren't presented as scary - they are likable and portrayed as ones who don't make good decisions and suffer the consequences that follow.  The music is so catchy that your little one will easily learn the words and will  be singing the songs all the time.  Great quality video - just wish there were more of them!!!",1428969600,,1217,4.720379146919432
