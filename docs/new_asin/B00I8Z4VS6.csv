It's mostly worth watching because it's an interesting first step as a filmmaker for Alain Robbe-Grillet. Interesting because you see all his future quirks forming even though censors of the time wouldn't allow him to go full blast like he would later.

The basic plot is about a lonely guy looking out his blinds at the sexy lady out by the dock. He meets her. Weirdness and mystery ensue involving Being John Malkovich style absurdism, potentially false memories, a maybe slave ring, and lots and lots of ladies wearing only the most fashionable of early 60s clothing. Wearing the outfits well no less.

The basic issue is that Robbe-Grillet hasn't put it all together yet. He's also a little too beholden to his own work. The blinds being a painfully self referential move in regards to his novel Jealousy. It also has a bit too much Last Year at Marienbad smashed into it. The censors also reign in what would be his later rather unfortunate excesses as a filmmaker. The hints though of the artistically minded unaware pornographer are there for those of a discerning eye.

I can't recommend this movie to people but it's not without interest. I've seen it twice. Once a long time ago and now again on Amazon video through the fantastic Fandor channel. I still don't like but I've never felt like I've wasted my time.",1505260800,,1474,4.705426356589148
