5004837,1,B006MHZ7ZS,"Usually, a good biopic leaves the viewer hungry to explore its subject even further.  At least that has always been my case.  Invariably, I have always gone into deep research whenever my curiosity has been pricked (no pun intended) by a biographical film.  James Franco, darling of The Advocate set, who report on his every move, has single-handedly managed to do exactly the opposite.  His self-indulgent exercise on the life of Hart Crane is so boring, dull, and devoid of life itself, that it leaves you with the feeling of never wanting to hear Crane's name spoken in your presence ever again.  Which, of course, is a disservice to Crane and his work.  Both deserve much better.  This film is a torturous waste of the viewer's time.  We get interminable shots of Franco doing nothing, or barely nothing, like walking the streets aimlessly, juxtaposed with interminable shots of Franco's dull renderings of Crane's poetry, complete with mispronunciations. And let's face it, whatever it is that Star Quality is, Mr. Fanco does not have it.  Marlon Brando could get away with interminable, boring, self-indulgent shots of himself (think Last Tango), but then, he was Marlon Brando.  Mr. Franco is not.  Mr. Franco also doesn't believe in sharing the screen with other actors.  Except for his little brother, who is prominently, if briefly featured at the beginning of the film, we hardly get a close-up of, or a line of dialog from, any other actor in this mess.  Mr. Franco also makes the mistake of writing 21st century dialog and putting it in the mouth of a man who lived from 1899 to 1932, when American English was not what it is today.  This, however, is a commonplace affliction nowadays, where anachronistic dialog is uttered in period pieces (think of the gems that come out of DiCaprio's and Winslet's  little mouths in Titanic)  Writers today seem to be totally unable to come up with erudite dialog representative of the period they are writing about.  In the case of Franco, this is cruelly exposed and highlighted by the juxtaposition of Hart's poetry readings, with the dialog his character speaks in the film.  Hart writes like a poet, in the English of his time, yet he speaks like anyone would today, in modern American parlance.  Totally anachronistic.  Not that Tennessee Williams went around uttering things like ""I have always depended on the kindness of strangers"", but then, I'm certain he didn't use the words bro, or dude either.  Or the infamous ""Don't do this!"", a line which finds its way into 9 out of 10 films and/or TV shows written today.  Who the hell came up with that one?  I have never heard ANYONE in any film of the thirties, forties, fifties, etc. say ""Don't do this!""  Ridiculous!  Also anachronistic is Franco's choice of music.  Considering that Crane died in 1932, I sincerely doubt he ever listened or danced to a Perez-Prado mambo, as Mr. Mambo King was a 16 year old school boy in Matanzas, Cuba at the time of Crane's death.  He didn't come up with his formulaic mambo rhythms until the late forties, when he emigrated to Mexico and became an RCA recording artist.  Noting Mr. Franco's penchant for homosexual biopics, I dread to see what he has done with poor Sal Mineo.  I wonder if Mr. Franco has managed to bore us  to death with Mineo's story, like he's done with Crane's, when Mineo led such a fascinating life.  And, Mr. Franco, do you really think we need to see you actually do a Sevigny?  What is your point?  Would you stab yourself and draw real blood if the character you were playing does?  I think not.  Film is film, not reality.  I suggest you limit your excursions into the art of fellatio to your own private sex tapes.  Though I must admit that both you and La Sevigny share something in common besides giving actual head on film.  Her picture was as crappy and insufferable as yours is.  So much for art, or the art of acting.",1339804800,12,3899,4.6946902654867255
5004838,1,B006MHZ7ZS,"This movie is very boring with long long moments of James Franco walking around the streets looking depressed.  I don't know much more about his character and the subject of this film, Hart Crane, than before I watched it.  James Franco is a good actor, but he needs a lot of help as a screenwriter and director in my opinion.  I've seen a couple of his other short films and they are all mediocre at best.  There is no real narrative for the story, very little dialogue to explain much of anything.  The few moments that there is any story exposition through dialogue and conversations with other characters are the best scenes of the film, I wish there was much more of that. Perhaps there could have been scenes of discussions with other writers or artists about the nature of art or the need to write, to express oneself and interpret the meaning of life and experience.  Instead what much of the film is is James Franco emoting silently while walking aimlessly for long periods in various cities around the world or while sitting in front of a typewriter and staring at a blank page.  We know he's depressed and suicidal, but little is explained about Hart Crane's relationships with various male lovers or his family.  Gay men in the 1920's and 30's were invisible in society and kept very low profiles and were limited to clandestine meetings behind closed doors.  I'm sure that was a very lonely way to live and the film hints at this as one of the reasons for Hart's incredible loneliness and sadness, but since we never get a real conversation between any of his lovers, we are left with a couple of sex scenes and don't know who any of these men passing through Hart's life are.  Watching the film feels more like watching a painting at a museum while wearing a headset listening to Hart Crane's poetry with a single character for 80% of it.  A much superior movie about writers is HOWL also starring James Franco as Allen Ginsberg and the famous poem he wrote.  There is so much more emotion and life in that movie than in Broken Tower, which just feels lifeless and void of emotion to me.  In HOWL during James Franco's reading of the poem throughout the filmmakers did something genius which was to use animated imagery to interpret the poem, which really brought it to life for me and helped me to understand what Ginsberg was trying to express.  In Broken Tower, we just see James Franco reciting in a flat monotone void of any emotion Hart Crane's poetry and it's difficult to understand much of it.  Skip Broken Tower and save your money and time and watch HOWL instead.",1336176000,7,2588,4.559395248380129
5004839,3,B006MHZ7ZS,"My trips into the world of poetry are few and selective.  In all honesty, I purchased ""Broken Tower"" as a companion film to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Howl/dp/B0042U9B3G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Howl</a>. When I purchased ""Howl,"" I half-expected not to like it but came away rather pleased at an artistically satisfying and interesting presentation of the poem by Allen Ginsberg.  The animation I half-dreaded seeing actually enhanced the poem's reading, and James Franco's portrayal of Ginsberg seemed convincing, including his effort to imitate Ginsberg's reading of ""Howl.""  Though I knew ""Broken Tower"" was a student project with a smaller production budget, I had some optimism that it would follow the experience I found in ""Howl,"" but that was simply not the case.  ""Broken Tower"" is a little disappointing.

Most poetry experts consider Hart Crane's poems ""difficult.""  They have strong erotic and sensuous components designed to create feeling and emotional effect rather than articulate meaning and self revelation.  Though Crane coined the term ""logic of metaphor"" to explain his poetical striving, it is intellectually obtuse and lacks the clarity of Hopkins' ""inscape"" and Keats' ""negative capability.""  If Franco was trying to make Crane more accessible by putting him into film, I think his efforts largely failed.  Little is done to explain the complexities of Crane's art despite full readings of his works. The visuals can be uninspired, lifeless, and incongruous to the narration.  There is one scene, however, of Crane inside a church shot in color, which gives the film a moment of transcendence, but unless you bear the prejudice of knowing that Crane saw an element of the mystical in his art form, its inclusion abandons the viewer to the world of the simply emotive.  Did Franco do this on purpose in an effort to mime in film what Crane did in print?  The optimist in me yells ""bravo.""  But perhaps Franco should have learned to animate?

You never really get a sense of the period (1920's America).  Most scenes are shot close-up, and by the end of the movie, you feel like you have been living in a tunnel for ninety minutes.  Franco relies on a few props and music to convey the era, but you never really feel like you have been transported to a different time.  The bits of Jazz make sense, but the use of an untrained church choir to sing ""Dona nobis pacem"" is baffling (I don't think Crane was Catholic), and by the third time you hear it, annoying.  The use of Ravel's ""Bolero"" (which has a nasty hiccup in its playback) is also mystifying.  Sadly, sound effects are also a little rough.  Sea noises are pretty much just noises.

I consider James Franco a good actor.  His portrayal of James Dean (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/James-Dean/dp/B00005TPLX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">James Dean</a>) was insightful and outstanding.  But he fails to shine in this performance, except for the sex scenes, which of course has everyone gossiping.  Crane considered his sexuality an important part of his art, but Franco never really makes the connection between sex and writing in the film, so the sex scenes become sublimely gratuitous or simply informational--Crane was gay. But the great weakness in Franco's performance is his voice.  Sorry, Franco fans.  Franco, I think, has all the lilt and cadence of a polite truck driver.  Paul Scofield, who's life is now rounded by a small sleep, need not fear a diminishing of his reputation from this quarter of the firmament.  In some ways, Franco's reading of Crane sounded a bit like his reading of Ginsberg, but what worked well in that film, did not translate into ""Broken Tower.""  I could not help but feel a lack of originality in his presentation.

There is one strength to this dvd.  The extras contain interviews with Crane scholars.  They were very interesting and informative, and if you purchase this dvd, make sure you see them.",1334361600,5,4004,5.2078125
5004840,5,B006MHZ7ZS,"Franco does a superb job as an actor, director and screen-writer. He is courageous in taking on the role of the homosexual poet Hart Crane.  Any actor must be a brave one to choose to play a gay man in our very homophobic America.  Franco seemingly doesn't give a damn about what people think, at least in this regard.  He is an actor and he surely wants roles that will challenge him as an actor.  In this film, he gives a moving performance, mostly by underplaying the role of Crane.  There isn't much dialogue, thus Franco must rely on relaying Crane's feelings and inner life by facial expression and by the artistic use of his eyes.  It is the sign of a gifted actor who can relay a range of emotons simply by his face, a kind of acting that culminated in during the Silent Movies.  Crane loved Charlie Chaplin, even wrote a poem about him.  Franco salutes Chaplin in his minimalistic acting, and by doing so makes Crane, a lost soul, even more endearing.  Franco isn't afriad of silence, and he isn't afraid of sexuality.  There are several highly erotic scenes, ones that most male actors would find very difficult to do, but Franco throwns himself into these scenes, making them real and poignant.  The scene that was particularly moving occurred when Crane was in bed with his lover. Crane was looking out his window at the Brooklyn Bridge, the subject of his most famous poem, and his lover, lying in his lap, looks up at him and says, ""There's nothing like this in the world.""  One could also say there is no poetry in the world like Hart Crane's, and Franco fearlessly includes a goodly portion of it in his film.  If one is to know about Crane, one must become familiar with his poetry, famous for its obscurity.  T.S. Eliot said that poetry can communicate even if it is not understood.  I didn't understand much of The Marriage of Faust and Helen, but I intuitively understood the emotion behind it.  And it was a delight to watch Franco declaim Hart's two poems, the other ""Grandmother's Letters.""  Franco in this scene employed his voice to its fullest advantage.  He has a fine speaking voice, and he was able to use it like a musical instrument, to convey the different emotions of the rather long Faust and Helen poem.  Eleven minutes of poetic declamation is daring in a movie, but he succeeds because he is such a fine actor.  He may have overdone the hand gestures, but other than that it was fine acting and declaiming.  There are so many fine things to notice in this film.  The background music, especially the Latin hymn ""Dona nobis pacem"" underscored Crane's search for peace, a peace he rarely found in his difficult life. The photography was black and white with one scene in color, in a Paris church.  The close-ups of Franco's face were very effective.  In one shot he looked very much like James Dean.  Franco has the intensity of Dean, but I believe he is a more intelligent actor.  Franco's intelligence comes across loud and clear in the bonus feature in which he discusses Crane's life with three professors through a computer.  Franco comes across to this viewer as a humble student, eager to learn from men who have devoted their lives to the study of Crane's life and poetry.  Professor Paul Mariani is superbly articulate, and he seems to understand more deeply what Franco tried to accomplish in his film.  Mariani suggests that Franco's film must be viewed many times, and its main purpose is to bring people to Hart Crane's poetry.  I believe Franco captured the heart of the man and the poet Crane.  His film will, I hope, inspire people to read Hart Crane's poetry.  One should start with his early poetry, which is more accessible.  I always recommend starting with ""Episode of Hands,"" one of the most beautiful poems I've ever read.  I also recommend that Franco's film based on Paul Mariani's book of the same title should go hand-in-hand:  Read Mariani's book first, then watch the movie.  After that, start reading Crane's Collected Poems.  Your life will be enriched.  Crane is a visionary, and he indeed has something important to say about li",1333756800,13,4096,4.645340751043116
5004841,4,B006MHZ7ZS,"I must confess that I ordered The Broken Tower for the wrong reason, because I read that James Franco did something in it that gay men do all the time but non-porn actors NEVER do on film, even openly gay actors in flagrantly gay movies. That bit was kind of a bust, but I ended up liking the movie anyway, for less sleazy reasons.

I know next to nothing about Hart Crane, and I don't know a lot more after having watched this movie. It's not a biography by any means. My best guess would be that it's James Franco's impression of what Crane was like, and that's what makes it interesting.

It's oddly directed, with very many long, handheld, extreme closeups, filmed from about chest-level, of Franco (as Crane) walking the streets of various cities, usually looking up from just under his chin, but sometimes looking at the back of his head. That motif repeats often.

At least 70% of the spoken lines in the movie are Franco (always as Crane) reading Crane's poetry: one long scene reciting to an audience in a formal setting, and much poetry read as a sort of narration as various events unfold on screen. This movie definitely is not for people who hate poetry - Crane's poetry in particular.

It's definitely not for people who need action, romance, likable characters, or a clear story line in movies. It's for people who can sit through a 108-minute experimental movie without any particular expectation as to what it's going to be like.

It's for people who appreciate enthusiasm and passion in artists (I'm talking mainly about Franco, but it applies to Crane too, I suppose) even if the result is not particularly coherent. It's obvious that this was a labor of love for Franco, and that more than anything else is what makes it interesting.",1333670400,21,1753,4.641935483870967
5004842,4,B006MHZ7ZS,"Hart Crane is one of the earliest poets who is credited with using the words and images in his poems to create an overall meaning to the poem, instead the words have a direct meaning. Director/writer/star James Franco seems to use this same technique to try and build an overall impression of Crane by presenting us with scenes from Crane's life and for the viewer from an idea of Crane as a man and poet. The results while artful are spotty at best and leave all but the most ardent Hart Crane fans wondering what happened.

""The Broken Tower"" presents us with scenes from Crane's life that are presented as separate vignettes with no context to link them or give an idea of traditional narrative. The scenes come from a teenage suicide attempt by Crane, his relationship with his father, his homosexual affairs, in his work as a copywriter, in his retreat to work on his poems, readings of his poems, and concluding with his relationship with Peggy Guggenheim.

As a director James Franco provides some interesting shots, such as, through the rounded window of the back of a car for a shot of intimacy, and some interesting effects running across the Brooklyn Bridge.

The problem lies in that's there's no connection to anything in the movie. Although, Franco presents a lot of Crane's poetry in the movie, we feel no connection to Crane as a poet, or what may have inspired those poems, except perhaps the Brooklyn Bridge which Crane immortalized in his poem, ""The Bridge"". Other aspects of Crane's personality also don't connect you to Crane, the man. We're shown scenes of Crane drinking, drunk, or hung over, but no reason is given or shown to the cause of Crane's angst, although it can inferred it is his homosexuality or even his bad relationship with his father or disintegrating relationship with his mother, but again these connections aren't explicit and only occur to one in hindsight. The overall effect is that unless you came in with a good knowledge of Hart Crane you're unlikely to walk away from this film with any greater knowledge or the bigger loss to Crane, an appreciation for his work.",1333411200,4,2112,4.7493188010899186

5004844,5,B006MHZ7ZS,"THE BROKEN TOWER will likely never be on the list of best films made, so why award it five stars? Because this very fine art piece is the result of the devotion of James Franco to his craft.  He worked directly with Boston College professor Paul Mariani, the author of a half dozen volumes of poetry, as well as several biographies of 20th-century American poets, including William Carlos Williams, John Berryman, and Robert Lowell: Franco based THE BROKEN TOWER on Mariani's similarly titled 2000 biography of Crane.

The subject of the film is the life and creative genius of Hart Crane, (July 21, 1899 - April 27, 1932) an American poet who found both inspiration and provocation in the poetry of T. S. Eliot, Crane wrote modernist poetry that is difficult, highly stylized, and very ambitious in its scope. In his most ambitious work, The Bridge, Crane sought to write an epic poem in the vein of The Waste Land that expressed something more sincere and optimistic than the ironic despair that Crane found in Eliot's poetry. In the years following his suicide at the age of 32, Crane has come to be seen as one of the most influential poets of his generation.

James Franco wrote the screenplay based on book by Paul Mariani, directed and edited the film and acted the main role of Hart Crane.  Crane was a nearly disconsolate man who refused to follow his wealthy father's business, longing instead to be a poet. Born in Ohio he traveled to New York (the place he always considered home), to Cuba, and to Paris searching for his poetic voice.  He was a gay man in an era when his lifestyle was always under threat, he had a lover (Vince Jolivette) early on in an affair that was filled with passion, and in his travels he seemed to find his true love in Emile (Michael Shannon) that endured the manic highs and depressive, death-haunted lows that befell this self -destructive visionary poet. He attempted suicide at least once and finally ended his life in a successful suicide at the young age of 32.

Franco breathes life into Hart Crane, offering more understanding of this enigmatic genius than we have ever been afforded.  In making the film Franco uses his younger brother Dave Franco to depict the young Hart and selects his small cast wisely. The film is completely in black and white and is in the format of `Voyages' - each voyage takes us through a distinct part of Hart's life: his gay loves, his poetry readings, his forays to Cuba and to Paris and his lonely hours of sitting before an old typewriter where he created the major epics of poetry that remain some of the finest ever written by an American poet.

The film is choppy, not unlike the manner in which Hart's mind worked in bits and pieces, always immersed in thoughts of the sea, the labor of common man, of the Brooklyn Bridge which would play the major role in his most famous epic poem THE BRIDGE, and of the fellow artists whose work he so admired. There is a strange musical score (the work of Neil Benezra) which is long on choral chanting, and a quality of gritty cinematography achieved by Christiana Vorn. The technique of the making of this film matches the vision of James Franco in continuing to visit the lives of isolated geniuses.  The dialogue, what little there is, is Crane's poetry as spoken by Franco.

For many this film will seem self-indulgent on Franco's part.  And perhaps it partially is.  But the flavor of this gay American poet of the 1920s and the reflections of America at that time ring true.  THE BROKEN TOWER is not a biopic of Hart Crane.  It is an elegy.

5004845,4,B006MHZ7ZS,"Amazing!  Unusual and rare!  The Broken Tower really captured the essence of Hart Crane's struggle's--without the usual crutch used by filmmakers--narrative!  That's right, you won't know explicitly why Hart may be reacting a certain way in very emotional and often violent scenes (only sparse hints are given).  I found myself guessing and wondering: why he is so upset and why does he react this way, why is he smiling now, why does he feel happy now and optimistic?  Even when he is walking you find yourself wondering where is he going, where did he just come from?  Yes, you have a general idea throughout the movie,  as in anyones life,  when big things happen why Crane is either up or down-- you go on a trip overseas, ok adventure and your happy, a parent dies your sad, you have a job you don't like your frustrated, your parents don't understand you that frustrates you.  Everything in this experimental film--even time( I found myself wondering how much time has lapsed between scenes...days, months?)-- is done with a broad brush; the only details being in the words of Hart Crane's poem and some wonderfully powerful sexually explicit love scenes.  But I found that this lack of narrative, of details, of facts, of  dialogue, even lack of timeline, even of storyline was a magical component to the film.  What it lacked did not detract but add; it added not only mystique  but, surprisingly, warmth and charm.  At the end I found myself wanting to explore Hart Crane--wanting to read his biography by Paul Mariani, wanting to know so much about his life, his literature and his influence.  What more could a biopic ask for?  After all if someone did a 1 1/2 hr film about your life would you want that to be the end all and be all?  Would you really want people to see the film and say,  'ok seen that done that don't need to read or see or know another thing about this person again' ? LOL, of course not! The Broken Tower is filled with emotion--I felt how Hart Crane was broken with sadness and I felt how his aspiring literary dreams, his dreams to harness 'being' towered inside him.  I loved this film; it was painterly, poetic and beautifully shot. I highly recommend it!",1326240000,14,2192,4.6175710594315245

5004848,3,B006MHZ7ZS,"I'm writing this because I find I'm thinking a lot about what the best part of this little-known film brings to light: the power of visionary thinkers to change the world. And not only in terms of this little film with its most incredible resonant scene, but because it's the first few weeks after the horrible extremist Islamic *ISIS* attacks on intellectual and artistic freedom in France.

In its own big little way, this film makes me want to keep shouting...Vive La France: Je suis Charlie!

If you're a writer, poet, or teacher of poetry or writing, or LGBT, this beautiful little film inspired by the intriguing, passionate life of American Poet Hart Crane, born to wealth who turned his back on it ---a film you've probably never heard of-- might be a wonderful and important talisman, with some ideas to think about in your life and work. It has definitely inspired me. I found it because I'm interested in Hart Crane,who turned his back on family wealth.

The sound track here was mostly horrible, and it's probably not in its entirety a movie that high school kids except in advanced English could get into. But I would hope it could be excerpted for exactly that group. One scene in particular...

About 20 minutes in, Crane is smoking on his bed, giving the *why poetry* rant of a visionary of 100 years ago, a historic crossroads when jazz and electricity were new, and it was time to take poetry in a completely different direction. So I hope you had a moment a bit like this when you went to college, or read your first awesomely inspiring book, because this scene made me recall some of those life-changing conversations during my university years and beyond. It's crucial to remember, this was a closeted and very self-aware queer man speaking in an era when homosexuality in America was a crime punishable by imprisonment in every state, such that bravery and cojones were required to trust anyone. Crane was facing being disinherited by his father at this point, as well.

While most of us never achieve fame, or reject an inheritance of significant wealth, this single, incandescent scene reminded me that we all have a human birthright: the opportunity to step outside our family and upbringing and even outside the routine of what will inevitably become, or perhaps already has been for years, our daily working lives. This kind of time to think deeply and widely outside the daily working life, and inside an institution of higher learning is an experience that was once the privilege of only the sons (not the daughters) of the very wealthy. You could say the same of a spiritual retreat...except across Europe for centuries, even the poor could go on pilgrimage, living from Church charity, city to city, even crossing national boundaries living on what were called *alms* ==charity food and shelter. In truth, this adventure in taking time out from life to think via pilgrimage was only safe for men during that era.

Yet we all benefit from this kind of time-outside-routine to think about where inspiration comes from, how we express it, and what the power of our deepest self-knowledge brings to us as individuals and to our national life. That is one more powerful element that makes us human, no matter what career we prepare for.

This freedom to think deeply, question loudly, and create freely is one more thing religious fundamentalists of many types --but particularly of extreme fundamentalist Islam, and to some degree, extreme fundamentalist Christianity, which I can speak of authoritatively because I came from that life-- want to erase from all possibility, from every city, every school, every nation.

Though this is an uneven little movie, watching this single scene tonight reminded me of how important it is to fight against the darkness perennially brought by those who want to control our thoughts and destroy both our pursuit of higher learning and our freedom of expression.

5004850,5,B006MHZ7ZS,Another surprise from James Franco.,1421020800,,35,6.2
5004851,5,B006MHZ7ZS,"The Broken Tower was written & directed by James Franco as an academic dissertation for which I hope he was awarded a High Distinction by his supervisor. The film has enough detail about Hart Crane's life to stand alone as a biopic of interest, being a black-&-white kaleidoscope of scenes veering between the painful & ecstatic in which we glimpse the genesis of difficult, darkly radiant poetry created by a passionate man as his short, hectic life - also difficult & dark - unfolds, unravels & ends.

However, if you expect a simplistic Hollywood-style 'this happened to Crane, which made him do that' explanation of his psychology you may be disappointed as this film takes us into territory that far transcends biography. I found it posing questions that perhaps are ultimately unanswerable in the medium of film, such as ""Is it possible to clearly convey a particular existential concept by image alone?"" - this in response to some of Franco's impressionistic camera work unaccompanied by text. (The answer is yes - look at Chirico's paintings, but Franco isn't telling Chirico's story.) Another is: ""In order to understand this film, how familiar am I expected to be with Crane's poetry to make the connection, if there is one, between his sometimes dangerously close to incomprehensible wielding of language, & Franco's sometimes equally obscure wielding of image?""

The Broken Tower can justifiably be called experimental as Franco takes risks & unless I know the questions posed that he seeks to answer, I cannot know for sure whether these risks have successfully paid off. Of course, this is exactly what will have me returning to the film. Like Crane, Franco counts on our active participation to bring meaning to his work. This isn't self-indulgent obscurantism on his part. The film has been accused of being pretentious by some critics who may have been too unimaginative or lazy to have allowed themselves to be swayed into accepting the demands of Franco's vision. This says more about those critics' own scepticism or fear, but of what? Of having to work at capturing meaning instead of having it drop ready-cooked into their open mouths?

Artists want us to engage intuitively & intelligently with their work & The Broken Tower is decidedly engaging, a source of continuing fascination that I'm glad is in my library. If one of Franco's intentions is to spark interest in Crane, paying homage to a man & his work both of which he clearly more than just admires but loves, he has done so magnificently. He has also succeeded in creating a powerful work of art in its own right.

An overall unanswerable question that will keep me hooked: To what degree is Crane really the subject of the film? I find myself responding to it as in music where composers reveal more & more of themselves in their variations on a theme by someone else. If Crane were the theme, could The Broken Tower's scenes be variations that incrementally reveal James Franco himself? He has the untrustworthiness of the actor's craft, intimate knowledge of literature, deep understanding of post-postmodernism & the amused, authoritative control of the is-he-or-isn't-he-gay (which is none of our business) tease at his fingertips, not to forget the self-assured auteur's mastery of visual fabrication, & all of them are on display. The film is worth having just for Franco's bravura recitations of Crane's poetry alone, where he spectacularly surmounts what must be enormous challenges in confident delivery. He also balances the Yin principle of saying-by-not-saying & its Yang corollary, not-saying-by-saying, combining them in a way that doesn't explode leaving a void as matter & anti-matter would, but still often has me asking myself what I saw, or didn't see. It's something like being at the centre of a complex hedge labyrinth left to neglect until reduced to a tangled mess while its caretaker's focus is elsewhere. Crane's physical life dissolved as he focused on its spiritual purpose. In Franco's vision of that life he has worked his clippers enough to ensure that, even though the central meaning may still be ragged & unclear, we find it.",1417046400,4,4143,5.017441860465116

5004853,1,B006MHZ7ZS,Did you ever see a photograph of Hart Crane? The late Bob Hoskins might have been a better fit. But that wouldn't have fit so well with Franco's narcissistic and so self-indulgent dream. I waited all movie for Walker Evans to appear. He didn't. It was only one of many omissions; any sense of history was the biggest.,1408665600,,317,4.482758620689655

5004855,4,B006MHZ7ZS,"Very grateful to have a film biography of Hart Crane. Not a dull, sanitized documentary (memories of Voices and Visions). James Franco is exactly the right person to take this project on and does right by it. But I think my viewing experience was strengthened by reading a lot (of confusing material) about Crane before I saw the film. Also appreciate the choice to do it in black and white. Fixes the mood very precisely. Again, very grateful. (And thanks for the reference to the book, Broken Tower, which somehow got past me.)",1404172800,,529,4.698924731182796
5004856,1,B006MHZ7ZS,The best part of this movie was reading the reviews written by some very educated people.  Maybe Mr. Franco should watch a movie like Marco Berger's HAWAII to understand the usage of long shots and close-up that add to the character development rather than (as happened in this movie) put you to sleep.  I hate to say this but I did fall asleep.  I watched it again with sub-titles which was better because I had something to read while Hart Crane walked and walked and walked -usually on a bridge.  I haven't had the courage to watch the commentary version although that might have a few unintentional laughs.  Poor Hart Crane.,1396656000,2,628,4.621621621621622
5004857,1,B006MHZ7ZS,"A disjointed view of the poet Hart Cranes life.  The movie is mostly silent, and if it does have dialogue it is mumbled, taking place during his writing of the ""voyage series"". Without any historical or biographical insight the movie has no substance, not even for a meditative, thought provoking look at Hart Crane's brief life.",1394064000,,329,4.875
5004858,5,B006MHZ7ZS,"I love James Franco so I loved this. If you don't like him don't watch it as you'll probably find it a bit annoying and dull. He looks very fit in it though, that should appeal to everyone.",1366934400,,189,4.0
5004859,1,B006MHZ7ZS,"Leaden acting, wooden directing, self-indulgent hubristic art garbage.  But at least you get to see James Franco felating a prosthetic. Of all the acting in the film, that bit was the most convincing.",1362096000,3,200,5.0606060606060606

5004861,5,B006MHZ7ZS,"If you like Bergman and Jarmusch you are in for a treat. The poet Hart Crane, played by James Franco, is in the same inner state anywhere he goes and whoever his company is. Stark emotional landscape is reflected in the choice of locations and lighting.
No matter where you go, you are always the same person, that makes this film interesting and I want to say educational. Like some people have told me before: ""If you can't be a good role model, at least be a dire warning""...well, something in that vein.",1359158400,,507,4.462365591397849
5004862,5,B006MHZ7ZS,"I enjoy watching James Franco on the screen. He is a brilliant actor in both big budget film as well as lower budget , stage, etc. He is connected to his craft, which is writing,directing, starring.",1358121600,,198,4.527777777777778
5004863,4,B006MHZ7ZS,"Trying to explain about a poet and his rle in society is not easy - even Doctor Zhivago went for the love story approach. As such, James Franco makes a decent job but the lengthy recital in the middle will alienate many. What audience is being targeted
is difficult to assess, so I would describe it as an interesting failure.",1357344000,,326,4.45
5004864,5,B006MHZ7ZS,"This movie is a visual poem, making use of film techniques to capture a poetic mood. It tries to capture the spirit of Hart Crane and what the commentators keep calling his ""difficult poetry."" Though I cannot say the film captures that mood exactly, it captures something interesting and makes that spirit palpable and immediate.

The film makes interesting use of space and time. The camera is usually non-traditionally placed, either ""running"" behind Crane trying to keep up or staring off at something from Crane's point of view. The film is interesting and well-paced and is parceled out in chapters, called ""voyages.""

Probably, this film is not for everyone. It has some of the same qualities of 2001: A Space Odyssey, making good use of music and silence. There is a narrative line in the film (Crane's biography) and the story is easy to follow, but the film is not exactly a narrative film. Sometimes it has the feel of a moving painting or a collage in process: layer after layer is added as the film progresses. Many different locales and settings are utilized in the movie, but by the end, it interestingly all feels like we had been looking at different parts of one big canvas the whole time, mostly because of unique use of the intimate point of view. Maybe it is more like a delightful treadmill. We go everywhere--New York, Cleveland, Cuba, Mexico, Paris, up stairs, down stairs, under bridges, over bridges, on the water, in trucks, loading trucks, outside, inside, poetry readings, poetry writings, dancing in ballrooms, screwing in bedrooms--but never leave the place we start from: Crane, Crane, Crane.",1350777600,4,1623,4.91970802919708
5004865,5,B006MHZ7ZS,"James Franco's The Broken Tower is at once a brilliant telling of the life and works of poet Hart Crane and also an extremely difficult film for an average audience. I am not saying that one has to be an intellectual to ""get"" what the filmmaker is doing, but rather he must let himself be swept away with the sound of Crane and the images of Franco. Where else would one get a ten minute segment of a poem reading? You have to be able to go with this and not see it as static, but rather as an extremely moving bit of filmmaking. Franco, who wrote, directed and starred in he film, holds up a very real middle finger to those who will see his work as pretentious, even as he wears his heart on his sleeve(No pun intended!) This film is a labor of love that moves to the rhythms of Crane's work. It is both tough and tender at the same time and we are left, at the end,with a tremendous sense of loss as a great literary figure disappears under the waves of  rejection and disapproval. Congratulations Mr. Franco. You had the balls to make this film and you succeeded brilliantly.",1343174400,5,1079,4.263414634146342
8500846,2,B006MHZ7ZS,"This is NOT a good movie.  Perhaps it was a school project.  I was hoping that it would be  a fairly straightforward bio pic, or at least provide the basic info about Hart Crane's short life, which it clearly does not.  There are several extended sequences that add nothing to the ""plot,"" such as it is, but were perhaps supposed to set a ""mood.""  For example, a long scene of Crane wandering aimlessly around in Paris tells us nothing about him.  And the scene with Crane reading a very lengthy sequence of his poetry to an unappreciative audience had me uncharacteristically hitting the fast forward button.  Too much is too much.  The chapter headings drop place names without telling us anything about what  significance these places held for Crane. Sure, I can subsequently look it up and find out for myself, but I shouldn't have to do background research just to make sense of the protagonist's wanderings.  So this is just a sort of jazz take on Crane's life, a mood piece, as it were. Even if Crane's life was a tortured one, there is no need for the film's audience to be tortured, too.  Skip this one.",1507075200,,1112,4.565656565656566
8500847,2,B006MHZ7ZS,"I could not decide between one or two stars. Obviously I opted for the two stars. This movie is what some of my friends would call 'artsy' which is not necessarily a bad thing but way too much time was spent on eg. a close up of Franco/Crane from different angles, or him lifting and carrying bags of whatever (I believe it was six times - back and forth, back and forth). Overall the movie was boring as well as frustrating. The reason I did give it two stars - Franco's reading of some of Crane's poetry was well done and because I understand that he was attempting to demonstrate the anguish that Crane went through. My recommendation - don't bother.",1491955200,,653,4.404958677685951

8500850,3,B006MHZ7ZS,"Franco does a decent job portraying Crane. I was actually a fan of the black and white choice over shooting in color. I believe the film does a decent job at showing who Hart Crane was, his drive and passion, but falls flat in completely portraying the complex person Crane was. In the end the viewer doesn't fully see Crane's despair in feeling as though he couldn't write anymore...that his ""talent"" was dwindling. Franco's reading of Crane's poetry also doesn't enhance the power of Crane's work; rather, it sounds like a decently versed MFA student reading Crane's work. It just feels dispassionate. That was not Crane. Overall, I felt the film was decent. Would I watch it again? Probably not. But some of the shots are fantastically framed, I'll give Franco that.

I say watch it. If you're new to Crane's work then you may find it enjoyable. I've just been jaded by reading much of his poetry, journals, and biographies. Maybe start here and then go out into the reading?",1479772800,,978,4.719298245614035
