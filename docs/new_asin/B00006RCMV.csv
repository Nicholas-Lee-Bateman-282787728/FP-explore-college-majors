1787379,4,B00006RCMV,"A witty and thought-provoking tale from the days when tv actually showed some ground-breaking stuff.

What did the previous reviewer expect? Something with Sylvester Stallone?",1094515200,4,175,6.0
1787380,5,B00006RCMV,"A fine transfer of a classic television film. Bill Bixby shines as Tandy, a man who refuses to believe he has died and tries evereything to convince 'Morte', the excellent Jose Perez, to send him back for another chance. He is well suported by the gruff Stephen Elliott, the demure Valerie Perrine. Ken Mars does well as the stockbroker and Herb Edelman is also at his best. Full of quoteable dialogue, this is highly recommended.",1079481600,25,430,4.746666666666667
1787381,4,B00006RCMV,"I first saw this TV adaptation of Bruce Jay Friedman's offbeat off- Broadway play on PBS Channel 28 in 1973 and was impressed not only by Valerie Perrine's nude shower scene but by the rest of the cast (Bill Bixby, Herb Edelman, Jose Perez, Shirley Kirkes, et al) and the bizarre story line -- an odd assortment of strangers find themselves in a Steambath, not knowing how they got there or why. The attendant seems to be the only one who has a purpose there.  A terrible purpose, we learn as the plot unfolds!  I saw this TV play twice back then and as far as I know it has never been shown since.  But at least it's available now on DVD.  I recommend it to all who enjoy a good comic fantasy with some serious overtones.  The image quality is good, though a little soft (perhaps because it's in a Steambath?) but there are no bonus features except for some trailers for other Broadway plays available.  Enjoy this effort from the early days of PBS when it was bold, daring and innovative -- you never saw anything like this on network TV back in those days!",1065312000,62,1059,4.350253807106599

1787458,4,B00006RCMV,"Bruce Jay Friedman is probably best known as a screenwriter, but his writings encompass a wide field, including plays for the stage.  Among these is the 1970 STEAMBATH, which opened off-Broadway in 1970 with Anthony Perkins in the lead.  Audiences of the era were shocked by the play's profanity and occasional flashes of nudity, but it had a good run for an off-Broadway ""experimental"" show of the time, running about five months.  The play was adapted for television, with some revisions, by PBS in 1973.  It was considered as shocking as the original play, partly because of the way in which it depicted God, but more specifically because it included shots of Valerie Perrine's naked breasts.

The PBS version tamed the language of the play, but both play and film are essentially the same.  Tandy (Bill Bixby) wanders into a steam room, where he meets an assortment of unexpected individuals--including Meredith (Valerie Perrine), who seems distinctly out of place in a men's steam room.  Over time, however, Tandy realizes he is dead and this steambath is a essentially a waystation in his journey to an unspecified final destination.  He is much annoyed to find that God is a heavily accented Pureto Rican bath attendant (Jose Perez); he is even more annoyed when the attendant attempts to prove his divinity by a series of carny-like tricks.  Ultimately, the attendant reveals himself as God--and then demands that each of the people in the bath tell their personal stories before being forced to travel to through a door that opens onto whistling wind and darkness.

In some ways the play is derrivative.  In modern theatre he notion of a ""waystation"" in the afterlife goes bact at least as far as the 1923 play OUTWARD BOUND, and the notion of hell being a locked room similar to a steam bath was memorably imagined by Jean-Paul Sartre in the 1944 NO EXIT.  STEAMBATH wrings a few changes on the idea, most particularly by presenting the events in a bizarrely surrealistic way.  Two elderly men bicker; a pair of homosexuals speak in unison and suddenly break into song and dance; a failed stock broker is accompanied by an electronic ticker.  When God issues instructions, he informs a machine that presumably implements everything from death and destruction to mercy and kindness.  It many ways it is quite funny--but the end is slap in the face, when Tandy begs to be returned to life only to discover that, in spite of his protestations, he really has nothing for which to live after all.

It's interesting stuff, but it is also very dated.  What shocked us in 1970 hardly makes us turn a hair today, and the play itself is visually static and the script is very, very talky.  The portrait of the gay men is also very dated, quite funny at times, touching at a particular point, but very, very close to being offensive by today's standards.  Even so, the performances are good--especially Perrine's wide-eyed innocent Meredith and Perez's take on God.  Certainly worth watching, but probably best seen by theatre fans.

1787459,5,B00006RCMV,"Definitely off-the-wall and the kind of humor that's disappeared in this country.
I first saw it on PBS back in the '70s (back before all the politically correct bologna) and it's remains just as funny today.

1787461,5,B00006RCMV,"Glad I found it on DVD. I origionally had a VHS copy from the TV station that it was on and had to sign a release that they owned it and could recall it if they choose, or something like that. How things have changed. Really interesting concept.",1291161600,2,245,4.125
1787472,5,B00006RCMV,"Back in the day when PBS (or was it still NET in 1972?) was a bold organization that pushed the envelope of TV production, when Great Performances included ""Theater in America"" and wonderful actors, such as Blythe Danner, were showcased to a national audience - and when Valerie Perrine dropped her towel to the delight of all the men watching, including Bill Bixby and Stephen Elliot - the legend of Steambath was born.  Bruce Jay Friedman's thought-provoking play was fully realized by a talented cast, including Bixby playing a former police academy art appreciation teacher, who's just set off on a new direction in his life.  He, and we, realize just how new this direction is partway though the first act.  And it has nothing to do with Charlemagne.

Dry humor, a skit, a musical number, Perrine's eye candy and surprisingly good characterization, and God are all included in this delightful mix.  The language was a little salty for the day but would not get bleeped now; however, the full rearal nudity (male and female) still would get clipped almost 40 years later.  Very little is dated except perhaps the electronic sounds emitted by The Machine; they seem oddly overdone now, but remember, this predates ""Pong"".

I taped this show in 1975, on U-Matic videocassettes that ran $60 per hour-long cassette (before Betamax made its home VCR debut).  It was worth it to me to have $120 in 1975 dollars invested in this show, as I watched it many times with different sets of friends;  it always kicked off a lively discussion.  At under $25 in 2010 dollars, this is a no-brainer.

The transfer to DVD is basic but functional and clear.  No commentary or anything; sadly, not too many of the cast are still living.",1285113600,2,1720,4.773648648648648

1787475,3,B00006RCMV,"An amusing, well performed insight into the immediate after-life - with an unexpected twist. Thought-provoking. Denial leads to some superb introspection. Find out that even God has a sense of humor.",1252195200,2,199,5.451612903225806
1787476,3,B00006RCMV,"This is a program that I saw on Public Television back in the early 70's.
When I found out this was on DVD I couldn't wait to see it again. I have to say I was a bit dissapointed to notice that some scenes were altered from the original broadcast. Call me a purist, but I love to see things the way they were originaly broadcast.

This program originally had nudity, in particular Valerie Perrine's shower scene. In the original you can see her breasts, in this version you do not. There is a black bar that appeares on the bottom of the screen during the front shot of the shower scene, blocking out the nudity.(There is also another scene with her that is cut)

Now this is not that big a deal as far as the story goes, you can still enjoy the play, and it is a good one. I gave this 3 stars because of the censorship on the DVD version. What made this controversial as far as television was concerned at the time was the language and nudity.

It seems that nowadays just because it's on DVD does not mean it's complete.",1221436800,14,1022,4.204081632653061
1787477,5,B00006RCMV,"A chance to see Bill Bixby in a real change-of-pace role, playing a recently deceased man who slowly comes to realize that his life, to which he is so anxious to return, was not all it had cracked up to be. Bixby is thoroughly believable in his performance, by changes funny, anxious, fearful, supportive, intense, and even ever-so-slightly sleazy. He's the perfect choice to head this cast in a wildly offbeat story of a group of people who, having died, find themselves in a steambath on their way to their final destination, seeking questions from the Puerto Rican attendant - who just happens to be God.",1195862400,4,607,4.735849056603773
1787478,5,B00006RCMV,"The intriguing and imaginative plot, the excellent acting, and the tragedy of this TV adaptation of Bruce Jay Friedman's play not being available for today's audiences have been repeated by several reviewers. They are, in my opinion, all correct in their views about this wonderful, thought-provoking ""black"" comedy.

I know that at least one reviewer lamented the fact that many reviewers seemed to talk more about the ""nudity"" than the merits of the play/movie. I have not found this to be so. And, of course, in the version shown in the United States, there is not really any frontal nudity. However, I was fortunate enough to see Ms. Perrine not only when she was performing in Las Vegas, but in the uncut version of ""Steambath"" that was shown in the UK and on Armed Forces Television throughout the European continent in 1973.

Quite some time ago, after months and months of searching, I finally found the censored American version of ""Steambath"" on VHS at kultur dot com. I could not find it at a site mentioned by another reviewer. Kultur now has this on DVD as of May 2007. I do not know whether it was in response to the requests here and elsewhere to re-release this fine film, but it is now available on sites such as this one, Amazon dot com, and for rental on netflix dot com.

If ANYONE knows where I can obtain the 1973 UNCUT version shown outside the US, would you please contact me (see my review on imdb dot com, or just write to ww1965 at gmail dot com)?

Maybe it's just because I'm a guy, but I think that the uncut version should be made available today because it adds to the impact of this insightful character study of the various personalities of the men (and one woman) who are ""trapped"" in the steam bath room. The uncut version is still very mild compared to what is available today, and it was all done very innocently. However, you knew that you were in for something unusual when Ms. Perrine suddenly appeared in what was apparently a men's shower/steam bath facility and dropped her towel! (You only see her from the waist up whenever she is turned toward you, of course. After all, this was 1973. Nevertheless, Ms. Perrine was facing the camera enough in the uncut version to make a lasting impression on this reviewer!)",1179705600,8,2255,4.588089330024814
1787479,5,B00006RCMV,"Bill Bixby proves to be a real talent in this truly funny play in which a steambath is a sort of waiting place between death and the afterlife, and God is a Puerto Rican towel boy.  The only negative to this work is that it calls for some special effects that really are pretty limp technologically - but pretty fair for its day.  Valerie Perrine is actually a pretty good actress in this one.",1179014400,3,393,4.297297297297297
1787480,5,B00006RCMV,"I remember the first time I saw this, back in 1973. It was cutting edge content for that era and Valerie Perrine's shower scene added to the controversy, but it was funny and entertaining.

1787481,4,B00006RCMV,"I remember this production from my days working in the college media center, when video players were not in everyone's home yet. We had taped this show from PBS and we watched it over and over between classes and while working. I remembered it as being both hilariously funny and terribly thought provoking at the same time. When I watched it again recently I was not disappointed. If anything I liked it better than ever. The characters are mostly believable and interact in a very genuine way. The every idea of God being a puerto rican bath attendant stretches the boundaries of what is acceptable to the max but he does it so well. You almost want to believe it is all that easy...a steambath is not such a bad place to wait for eternal dispensation. Valerie Perrine and Bill Bixby are wonderful. You will enjoy this very original play.",1127260800,9,840,4.6066666666666665

7972497,5,B00006RCMV,"The basic story has been told in many ways and also some variation. Much more popular when purgatory was a real place. This is a story of a hand full of characters that find them selves at a crossroads or a steambath in their afterlife. Seams that the deity (Jos Prez) is the attendant who replaces towels and enjoys a good story.

The attraction on an esoteric level is how the people get along with each other. Then we have individuals contemplating past present. The steamy part of the play is Valerie Perrine; the first woman to show off her accoutrements on U.S. TV (4 May 1973) being in the altogether and filmed showering from the side.

The hinge point of this story is watching Tandy (Bill Bixby) who refuses to believe that the Attendant is the deity and is determent to get back to his former life. One can believe if he does not perturb the Attendant, Tandy just might pull it off.",1506729600,10,893,4.439024390243903
