 Overall a very good video!!!!

7956525,2,B00005Y78F,"Of all the Power Rangers series ""Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue"" was the weakest. After a fantastic finale to Power Rangers In Space and Power Rangers Lost Galaxy, I expected the same from this. Not the case. In relation to the whole series, the finale isn't that bad, but it still left me very disappointed. Get it if your a fan of all Power Rangers, but if not, skip it.",1027209600,,373,4.420289855072464
7956526,4,B00005Y78F,"Yes! Like the tagline of video says ""The Most Monsters! The Scariest Battles! The Biggest, ""Baddest"" Finale of Them All!"".
In the final four episodes of Lightspeed Rescue, the Rangers must stop the demons and save Mariner Bay from destruction. As Ryan the Titanium Ranger, brother to Dana the Pink Lightspeed Power Ranger and son to Captain Mitchell of the Aqua Base, he must find a way to capture the demons and send them back to their demonic tomb where they were once held before. But he is captured in the process by Queen Bansheera as he attempts to contact the Rangers and his father at the Lightspeed Aqua Base. And then the Rangers test out a new megazord Miss Fairweather creates for them, the Lifeforce Megazord in an attempt to stop Olympius, the Queen's son, and Diabolico, whom Olympius has under his power from destroying the city. But Diabolico tries to help the Rangers but him and Olympius are both destroyed by the newest megazord. And in the two-part series finale ""The Fate of Lightspeed Part and Part 2"", the Queen's head scientist demon Jinxer throws a Batling card on the megazord's leg and the Aqua Base would be ambushed by a large army of Batlings as Carter runs off to Skull Cavern to save Ryan from the Queen Bansheera. After escaping from Skull Cavern, Carter and Ryan hurry back to the Aqua Base as it is being destroyed by the Batling controlled Lifeforce Megazord, they must stop Queen Bansheera from resurrecting all of the demons the Rangers had once destroyed before and capture them and send them back to the demons' tomb once and for all. It is a battle for survival as you join Carter, Chad, Joel, Kelsey, Dana and Ryan in this spectacular series finale of Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue, the eighth incarnation of the popular Fox Kid series.",1020729600,,1781,4.693290734824281
7956527,5,B00005Y78F,"I am ashamed to admit that I at one time thought I was too old to watch Power Rangers anymore, (I'm 19), but after watching a few episodes of Time Force recently I was hooked all over again. The special effects of this video were awesome. And on a more mature note, the dramatic value and plot belivablity were excellent. I feel this series should have at least been nominated for several emmy awards for best childrens show, although I'm not much of a child myself. Beyond the Last episodes of PR in Space, this was one of the greatest finales ever seen for any television show. I was elated to see the LR rangers join the TF rangers on recently and I positively can't wait for the super 3 part finale for TF coming in December. It's time for a TF power rangers big screen epic!",1003536000,,779,4.3061224489795915
