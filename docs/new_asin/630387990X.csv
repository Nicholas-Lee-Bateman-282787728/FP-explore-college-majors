7854099,3,630387990X,"I am a huge fan of Nick Lea so, even though this film is formulaic and silly, it's worth watching just for Nick.  He's very good and *so* adorable!  He shows a real talent for comedy and it was nice to see the  lighter side of his incredible acting ability.  I must admit that if Nick  weren't in it, I would not buy it, but if you're a Nicknik, it'll be a  great addition to your collection :)",919123200,4,394,3.9871794871794872
