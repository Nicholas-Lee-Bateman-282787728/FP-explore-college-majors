8159149,5,B00005QZRC,One of the best ghost stories of all time. & Based on a true story. It stars Kevin Dobson who played Mack on Knots Landing. Love it.,1524528000,,132,3.925925925925926
8159150,4,B00005QZRC,"This is a low budget likely made for TV movie, but this is a tale that doesn't need a large budget to be told well.  I didn't recognise any of the actors in this one, but all do a decent job.  Basically a popular nurse who is also a rising singer on the local club scene has had a number of boyfriends who just don't accept she doesn't want to spend her life with them.  One night just about to set out to a gig someone knocks on the door, she opens it, he strangles her, then stabs her, then sets her on fire.  While this is happening a fellow nurse who works at the same hospital feels pain and other symptoms as her colleague is murdered.  She will then begin to see the murder happen and her husband experiences the murdered nurse's voice through the possessed body of his wife telling him off for not going to the police and telling them who murdered her.  She also fears a Bud Bundy with a pony tail lookalike nurse at the hospital and mentions he is the killer to other staff.  Of course he doesn't like this one bit.

The only thing I didn't like about this was we never learnt the motive for why he killed her.",1459900800,,1119,4.124423963133641

I really want to see this movie in English or at least see it with English subtitles. Please.",1395878400,2,245,4.104166666666667
