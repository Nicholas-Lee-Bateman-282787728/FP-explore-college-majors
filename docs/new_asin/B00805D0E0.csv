8523556,5,B00805D0E0,"This documentary of 56 minutes gives a compact and comprehensive picture of this ancient capital of China of Xi'an.  one of the birthplaces of Chinese culture and civilization.  It started with the clay army of Emperor Qin Shihuangdi discovered in 1974 and is the modern world wonder.  It is the cross road between China and Middle East in the famous Silk Road.  No wonder it is the very route that Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity came to China.  China appreciates and accepts all religions with no disputes and wars among them!  In the Stone Tablet Forest, this documentary shows  the slab commemorating the Nestorian missionary to China.  It also shows the glorious days of Han and Tang Dynasties by re-creating the colorful dancing and music.  The museum display of Tang tri-color clay horses, camels and foreigners illustrated the international intercourse in culture and trade.  In the Tang Dynasty, women enjoyed equal status as shown in riding horse and playing polo!
I highly recommend this program to viewers who want to know about China in an hour.",1429315200,,1060,5.005714285714285
8523557,4,B00805D0E0,"This is a DVD that shows one of the major sites of Chinese culture and civilization. Xi'an is the site of the incredible clay army discovered in 1974. Examples of Chinese theater and the culture of the area and of China in general are shown. It would have been interesting to have had pictures of the discovery of the clay army; we are just shown pictures of today and of tourists in the nearby marketplace.
Explanations of the history of trade and the Silk Road are given.

The DVD is filled with close-ups of everything, the players in the theater, the goods in the marketplace, the art work and treasures of the museums and temples. At many points one longs for some views of the whole picture.

This is an interesting 56 minute video. There are no extras and no subtitles for the deaf or other languages.",1357689600,2,808,4.489795918367347
