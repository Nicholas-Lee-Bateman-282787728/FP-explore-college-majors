8572584,5,B00BQI3WAU,"This is an interesting 60 minute video. It does have English subtitles for the hard of hearing.
It tells the story of the British listening in on officers from the German army that they captured during WWII. Over 4,000 German were POW's and some were put into stately homes and treated as guests where they became comfortable and began to talk with each other.
