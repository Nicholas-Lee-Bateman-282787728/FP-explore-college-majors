4693538,3,B005GRF31S,"After reading ""Into Thin Air"" and also watching the movie, I decided I wanted to watch what the IMAX crew had filmed while up on the mountain that May. I was alittle disappointed with it.  The Titanic dvd was alot better.",1371081600,,221,4.390243902439025
4693539,5,B005GRF31S,"The IMAX images are astonishing! Considering that workers carried these HEAVY cameras to the summit, brings images of an adventure of a lifetime.

I didn't finish watching Titanica. I was rather boring, drawn-out, even considering all that was done to get to those depths. Hopefully, I'll finish it to rate the movie.",1367280000,,317,5.096153846153846
4693540,4,B005GRF31S,I love this DVD.  I use it in my classroom in conjunction with the story Into Thin Air and this shows the students what exactly happened during that disaster.  It also shows students what Nepal is like (briefly).  Great movie!,1365292800,,226,4.6
4693541,4,B005GRF31S,"I ordered the movie basically for Everest, however, it turned out that Titanica was really the best!  Still, Everest had its merits.",1362960000,,132,5.0
4693542,4,B005GRF31S,"I have several movies about Everest so I can show them for teaching about the relationship between climbing peaks reaching personal goals. This particular one I originally saw in 3D at OMSI's Imax theater in Portland. It's good, but rather short and because of its length, the event feels a little ""go go go.""

I prefer the event drawn out a bit more like NG's, 5 Star ""Everest: 50 Years on the Mountain.""",1360713600,,405,4.5479452054794525
4693543,3,B005GRF31S,"Good quality movie but I thought it was going to be a little better, I only watched it once and can't remember very much of it.",1358380800,,127,3.923076923076923
4693544,5,B005GRF31S,"""Everest"" is excellent. Packed with adventure and drama. I used it to show my class before they read an excerpt of ""Into Thin Air"" by Jon Krakauer. It gave students a better feel for what happened during that fateful trip that some never returned from.",1348531200,3,252,4.622222222222222
4693545,3,B005GRF31S,"The content was excellent, as with most IMAX films. The film really help one to appreciate the intensity of danger being felt when being that far below sea level. However, the picture quality was not as good as expected and the sound quality was disappointing; in monophonic format.",1346544000,,282,4.895833333333333
8472231,5,B005GRF31S,"I saw this movie originally in an IMAX theater and was blown away with the scenery and stark reality of an Everest climb. Liam Neeson's voice is smooth as always and helps reflect on the scenes. This movie starts just as they were evacuating people off the mountain in one of the worst disasters on Everest in 1997. John Krakauer's best seller book ""Into Thin Air"" details the spectacle of that story that killed eight climbers. The movie is less than an hour, but shows the reality and danger of climbing Everest.",1521590400,,514,4.5978260869565215
8472232,3,B005GRF31S,The movies are good.  It's a great documentary with awesome footage.  I wish I would have shopped around for this as it is available for a lot less and is being resold from another retailer.  There was a tag on it and it was bought in a bargain bin on here it cost three times as much.,1473811200,,285,3.9649122807017543
8472233,5,B005GRF31S,Good movie and quick service,1473120000,,28,4.8

8472236,5,B005GRF31S,I gave this DVD as a gift to a family who encourages educational viewing.,1410566400,,73,4.285714285714286
8472237,5,B005GRF31S,"The subject matter of both films is fascinating to me, for reasons I don't really understand myself, but I know there are a lot of other people who are still hooked on the Titanic, even 100 years after it happened, and Everest is in a class all its own in terms of mesmerizing people, even those, like me, who've never set foot on a mountain.  Imax movies are meant to be seen on jumbo screens, I know, but even on a computer screen, they're amazing.",1395532800,,450,4.294117647058823
8472238,2,B005GRF31S,When someone says IMAX I am expecting top video quality. This DVD looks like it was pirated from an old VHS source. Not well thought out or presented... save your money and avoid this one,1389225600,,187,4.371428571428571
8472239,3,B005GRF31S,"Mainly purchased this dbl-movie DVD for EVEREST since it was better priced than purchasing the EVEREST DVD alone.  Bought this DVD to supplement my son's reading assignment, ""Into Thin Air"".",1377475200,,190,5.333333333333333
8472240,2,B005GRF31S,"After reading the book about the tragic quest to Everest that year, I was excited to see what the IMAX crew captured.  Unfortunately, they showed very little related to the deaths on the mountain and kept focused on the IMAX team.",1376784000,,230,4.609756097560975
