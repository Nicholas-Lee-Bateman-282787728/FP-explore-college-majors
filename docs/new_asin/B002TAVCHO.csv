8380000,5,B002TAVCHO,"Despite its positive ending, this is Luis Bunuel at his best.  The film contains lush black and white images of a Mexican town and also Mexico City.  The story revolves around an ancient custom in the fictious town Santa Viviana:  if after killing someone the killer can escape across the river, he is not pursued and is allowed to live in self-banishment on the other side of the river.  When two rivals break the tradition and start to become friends, trouble results.  The tension between urban and rural, modernity and tradition, and order and lawlessness is a driving theme.  There are beautiful shots of desolate small town streets at night; also of the UNAM in Mexico City during the day.  There is a startling shot of one character's face being spattered with blood, showing that Bunuel still has the power to shock.  Unfortunately I have not seen a version with subtitles in English, but I would say it's worth learning Spanish just to see this film.  It is an unrecognized masterpiece.",1361491200,5,995,4.771929824561403

and in almost every shape: you could wait for a forgotten masterpiece to load on youtube,try to buy dvds from regions not your own,an amazon is a really good place for the second!
this region 1 and 4 dvds are a great way(and sometimes affordable even)to find overlooked gems of film story or of countries not so big or directores long dead but always relevant!",1320796800,,445,4.506172839506172
