4985937,5,B006GB2T0G,"Good release, this movie that was shot in Moscow exists in two languages: English and Russian. This is the English version for the US, great acting from Mischa Barton and Shantel Van Santen, who play the main roles. In this movie they are 2 girls who meet each other thanks to the web and their common passion: the Russian pop band (duo) t. A.T.u.! They desperately want to go to their concert and meet them, but the movie develops in a tragic way showing the bad side of Moscow: behind this glittered world there is a world full of prostitution, drug addition and no healthy values. t. A.T.u. appear in the movie as well, in the role of themselves: Julia Volkova and Lena Katina, and they're going to help the two girls, who fell in love with each other in the meanwhile. After all, their love is strong and will survive despite all the bad events occured. A ""must-have"" for all the fans of the Russian duo.",1409270400,2,908,4.4431137724550895

4985939,5,B006GB2T0G,"I like it, but of course... it isn't a excellent movie. I watched this movie because of the group t. A.T.u.! the movie has a nice end with a Tatu's concert.",1386892800,2,156,4.064516129032258
4985940,4,B006GB2T0G,"It took forever for this to get released, even on DVD.  I'm talking years.  By the time it came out I was expecting it to be awful.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  It's nothing groundbreaking, just an entertaining B movie about a couple of girls who become friends due to their mutual interest in the group t. A.T.u., only to get into a lot of trouble when they venture to places they shouldn't, entering into a world of drugs, prostitution, etc....",1360800000,5,451,4.530864197530864
4985941,2,B006GB2T0G,movie was alright. the acting was ok. the plot to me and my partner was kinda confusing and seemed to jump into the story without much background on what was going on. not the worst movie but not something i'm probably going to watch again,1353456000,4,239,4.333333333333333
4985942,5,B006GB2T0G,"No the movie is not the best movie ever made but I did like it and will watch it again. Too bad there is not a soundtrack. I would have to have some of the other songs from the movie. I would have liked there to be more to the sex scene with this girl but oh well. The best part of the movie for me was around scene 4 and 5 when they actually played Vaughan Penn's song ""Ready to Rise.""",1337212800,,386,3.7195121951219514
4985943,5,B006GB2T0G,Finally this movies gonna come out! I've been waiting since 2008 & finally it has release date. I've loved t. A.T.u. since I was in 4th grade & now I'm a freshman in college. Disbanded or not I will always support them :) t. A.T.u. forever!<3,1323302400,20,242,4.282608695652174
4985944,1,B006GB2T0G,"This movie had a $12 million budget and pulled in about $900,000 during its Russian and Ukrainian run early this year. I've watched both the Russian and English language versions, and it's bad in either language. Barton even skipped the Cannes premier.

The movie is completely plot-less, the acting is one step above Plan 9 From Outer Space and the dialogue is moronic. Why anyone would deliberately search out the now-disbanded Russian pop group t. A.T.u. is beyond comprehension. However, I think there is a sales record waiting to be awarded to this DVD -- fewest copies sold.",1323302400,5,580,4.918367346938775

THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT 2 STARS IS BECAUSE THE ACTING IS GOOD. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS CRAPPY MOVIE.",1417132800,,256,4.14
