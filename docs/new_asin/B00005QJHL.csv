1648500,5,B00005QJHL,"I agree that this Wings documentary may place to much spotlight on Linda.  But heck, he loved her as did their children -- and they are the ones that put this together...and right after her death.  I hazard to say that many people would be in the tribute mode after such a terrible tragedy.
I think it does capture what Wings really were:  It was Paul, his wife and a bunch of changing employees that made up Wings.
I think to many people try (including Paul himself at times) and push Wings as a band much like the Beatles.
Wings had the same sort of success as The Beatles --- stayed together longer --- but this was not a band like The Beatles with its three very talented musical minds --- this was Paul McCartney and a rotating group of his employees.  (...)
At any rate....any look into Paul McCartney and his music is well worth the cost of the DVD to me.  I look forward to another in the future.",1008115200,3,904,4.2631578947368425
1648501,5,B00005QJHL,"The first album I ever bought was Venus & Mars - I'm a diehard Wings fan and always will be. I love this DVD. Yes, there could have been much more (the Back To The Egg videos, Kampuchea, Goodnight Tonight, Midnight Special, etc.) but I judge this release on what it is. Wonderful interview with Paul. I adore the man. He is just so charming and its obvious he enjoys telling these old stories. Some of the old news footage is amazing -especially regarding the drug bust in Japan. There wasn't much in the news here when that happened. The home movies are touching to say the least. Highly enjoyable. Not to be missed by Macca's fans, and would easily be enjoyed by casual fans. Hugs and kisses Paul!",1007337600,5,699,4.426356589147287
1648502,3,B00005QJHL,"""Wingspan"", as noted, purports to be one thing but clearly becomes another.
While we certainly feel his warmth of memories to his late wife, Linda, the story of Wings had little directly to do with her. Wings was a performing and recording band, they played concerts and made records.  But what is also impossible to argue, Linda McCartney's actual contributions to either live shows or records was minimal.  Those records and shows rested in the hands of Paul and his able band of musicians.
What's disappointing is how little we really know of the MUSIC of Wings from this DVD.  How little of the musicians, how they came into the group, what became of them, how they contributed.  That's a real shame; they worked hard to keep up with an ex-Beatle, to do him and themselves proud, and make records that could stand up to the legacy of Paul McCartney.
Instead, we get to know more about Linda McCartney than perhaps we really need to know.  It's no surprise that their love was incredibly strong - we've known that all along, they were very open, public and direct about that.  And her impact on his life was, without question, immeasurable.  But, it is also fair to say that her direct impact on the music of Wings was VERY measurable, and the overemphasis on her contributions defeats the thesis of this program.
It's unfair to diminish Linda McCartney's place in the life of her famous husband, but it's equally unfair to overshadow with her memory the fine collaborations of the various members of Wings.  That's the real Wings story, and sadly, you won't find much of it here.",1006128000,18,1583,4.689530685920578
1648503,4,B00005QJHL,"In intimate conversation with daughter Mary (whose husband directed), Paul McCartney discusses life after the Beatles, and how his next challenge was to form a band, pack up the family, and hit the road.  88 minute film seen on ABC-TV is satisfying for fans but footage shown could have been expanded.  We just get snippets of great songs and rare concert footage, and there isn't any interviews or commentary with the rest of the band (save for Linda's posthumous comments) especially from loyal, talented, long-suffering Denny Laine who was there from start to finish.  DVD extras include an additional 22 minute discussion between Paul and Mary, promotional videos for ""Jet"" and ""Let 'Em In"" (which were both taken from the ""Rockshow"" film) and the superstar jam ""Rockestra"".  Just three videos?  Also included is a discography and a photo gallery, with 100 pictures.  A neat package, but they should have alloted themselves more than 88 minutes to cover a nine-year career, especially with all the great music involved.",1005609600,17,1023,5.095808383233533
1648504,2,B00005QJHL,"Like the CD collection ""Wingspan,"" Paul is again treating Wings the group with little respect.  This documentary is far from being the definitive retrospective on Wings, and it would be more properly titled ""Linda McCartney's Life with Paul, Vol. 1 1967-1980.""  The focus is relentlessly on Linda and her life with Paul, while the contributions of the other members of Wings (which was ever-changing save Denny Laine, who was there from beginning to end) are largely overlooked.  There are some nice clips, but the focus never seems to settle on the group and their music for very long before veering back to the McCartney's domestic life.  The documentary is steered along by a present-day ""interview"" of Paul by daughter Mary McCartney, supplemented by lots of audio clips of Linda.  The bonus song promo clips are nice, but I would have been happier with a complete collection of Wings promo clips.  This sort of documentary pales in comparison to more objective work like the ""The Beatles Anthology"" and even ""John Lennon: Imagine.""  I hate to say it, but I wish Paul would have done the Wings retrospective before Linda died.  Or let someone else make it.",1005609600,7,1160,4.912820512820513
1648505,5,B00005QJHL,"This DVD is an expanded version of the television special that aired in May, 2001 on ABC.  It is an intimate and interesting look not only at the band Paul McCartney started after the Beatles, but at the love story between Paul & Linda.  Through home movies and an interview between Mr. McCartney and his daughter Mary, we get an inside view of one of the most famous and enduring marriages in entertainment history.  The DVD also includes vintage videos for ""Jet"", ""Let' Em In"" and ""Rockestra"" as well as over (100) still pictures.  A must own for all Wings fans and a perfect companion for the Wingspan cd.",1005609600,5,608,4.5504587155963305
1648506,3,B00005QJHL,"While I'm not exactly the biggest fan of most of Paul's solo music (my favorite solo Beatle is George), this supposed documentary could have had the potential to change my opinion of his solo career for the better.  An in-depth analysis and critique of the songs, the various members of Wings besides Paul and Linda, and the process of making the albums could have made me look a bit more kindly on his music and not be so inclined to dismiss it as cheesy lightweight meaningless pop, as many of his critics do.  That opportunity was wasted and squandered here.  This so-called documentary is little more than the story of Paul, Linda, and their family.  What material there is on the actual music is disappointingly brief and shallow.  We barely learn anything at all about the other members of Wings, and their names are barely even mentioned at all.  Why in the world weren't there any other people interviewed for this project, particularly Denny Laine, the only bandmember who was there the entire time?  Their perspective would have enhanced the viewer's understanding and appreciation of the music a lot, and made the story not seem so terribly one-sided.  This only confirms what just about everyone has known all along, that Wings were little more than a backup band for Paul.

Having Paul's daughter Mary interview him is barely a step up from someone interviewing oneself.  Was he afraid that a less impartial and fawning source would have asked harder-hitting and more specific questions?  I'll admit it was really sweet to see the interactions between father and daughter, but it's just not very professional to have your own child interview you.  Naturally, she'll avoid questions that might cast her beloved father or his music in a less than perfect light, because of how close she is to the subject.  And I totally call BS on Mary's stunned reaction to being told that Yoko moved her bed into the studio while The Beatles were recording the White Album.  We're supposed to believe the child of an actual Beatle never heard such a well-known story ever before in her life?

In spite of how the focus is almost entirely on the McCartneys' family life and not the music, and the rather kid-glove treatment of Paul and the late Linda, I did enjoy seeing all of the home movie footage.  Whatever I might think about his solo music (and his inclusion of his less-than-musically-gifted wife in the act), it's obvious that Paul provided his kids with a really happy stable loving family life growing up.  The footage of a few songs in the bonus material is also nice, as are the clips of videos we see in the actual body of the film.  It's just unfortunate that this material couldn't have been assembled by people who weren't so close to the source and who had interviewed other people, not just Paul and using audio clips from Linda.",1216080000,2,2844,4.734279918864098
1648507,2,B00005QJHL,"First, I'm a big fan of the Beatles, Paul, and Wings.  All artists have their hits and misses.  And this mockumentary is a miss.  As others have stated, this is the story of Paul & Linda McCartney from 1969 to the 1980s, and not about the group Wings 1971-1979.  What does the breakup of the Beatles, or Paul and Linda's marriage have to do with Wings?  It's odd that Paul starts by saying how he wanted to form a band after the Beatles, then basically ends up proving it never really was a band.  He rarely even mentions a band member by name!  It's usually ""the guitarist"" or ""the drummer""- as if it was whoever happened to be there.  This just comes across as a commercial for Paul by Paul, as most of his videos do.

For an ""inside documentary"" I didn't hear anything I didn't already know.  And I don't think you will either.  Most fans already know that Paul, Linda and Denny recorded Band on the Run after the first guitarist and drummer quit.  What we want to hear is why?  And not just Paul's version, how about asking the band members themselves?

I think Paul ends up answering the question unwittingly:  They were probably tired of being ignored and the whole thing being about Paul.  Oh this was Paul's show the whole way alright- no question about it- and this proves it.  But we already knew that.  So what does this documentary accomplish?  Not much.  It's as if it's designed for someone who know's nothing about Paul (Really? he was in the Beatles before Wings?  His wife was in Wings too?)

Not enough music, either.  What would have made this documentary work would be a year to year review, with Band members and others, discussing how songs were written and recorded, the concerts, the ""behind the scenes"" relationships of the band mambers, etc.  This DVD is an insult to Wings members and fans.  I'm left with a DVD that was mildly interesting to watch once.  But I'll never watch it again- I already knew all of this in the first place!",1173052800,10,1960,4.466101694915254
1648508,5,B00005QJHL,"I thoroughly enjoyed the interview of Paul and the background of how things unfolded from his view. It was heartwrenching to learn how things went for Paul, Linda and their children when the Beatles broke up. I highly recommend this DVD.",1166140800,4,237,4.804878048780488
1648509,5,B00005QJHL,"This is a very moving story. The format is an interview of Paul by his daughter Mary about Wings the band. It's really the love story of Paul and Linda and it moved me to tears. I am a Paul McCartney fan and I also admired Linda. In 1976 I attended the 2nd night of the lst US Wings tour and was blown away by the performance. Wings was so tight, you just could not believe it was (only) their 2nd night out! I was close to the stage (those were the days-huh?) and the music was amazing. Anyone who thought that Paul needed The Beatles to continue his career was wrong. I found the Wings concert so much more fun than The Beatles concert I attended. Paul's acoustic performance of ""Black Bird"" and ""Yesterday"" had the concert hall in complete silence. It was magical. The Wingspan DVD is so full of warmth, music and a real joy to watch. It was a great band and a great love story. After all, how many of us could be in a band full time,raise your children,write, record,and have a successful marriage at the same time? Not many. After watching this, you will be amazed at their life, devotion, creativity,family, etc. And when Wings music comes on the radio you'll have a whole new respect for Sir Paul.",1148256000,6,1204,4.331858407079646
1648510,5,B00005QJHL,"ABC ran this as a television special a few years ago, and it was memorable enough to stick in my head until I finally ordered it last week.  Starting with the sad, jaded ending of the Beatles and his marriage to Linda Eastman, this is a great rockumentary fans of McCartney from any era of his career will want to pick up.  Linda was a great accompaniment to both the man's music and his personal life.  If you need further proof of that than this musical bio, I suggest you read Many Years From Now by Barry Miles or Blackbird by Geoffrey Giuliano.

An often undeservedly persecuted group, Wings spawned an impressive credential of hit singles and albums during the 70s that rival all the animosity and, to be fair to Linda, she was no Yoko.  Paul WANTED her to be in his group, so he taught her how to play keyboards.  Her presence was also appreciated--not resented--by the other Wings members.

It is amazing to see all the footage that was captured over the years of the McCartney family and the group, and it's great to view it all--and some pleasant extras here.  What really impresses me is that Mary (allegedly Paul's favorite daughter), who bears a striking resemblance to him was chosen to interview him for the special.  You can see how relaxed he is with her and how obvious it is that they have a great father daughter relationship.  A journey full of personal warmth, great music, and visual insight that makes you feel like you're an insider, this is a great DVD bio for any McCartney fan's collection.  On a personal note, I would like to say thank you, Macca, for such a priviledge.",1141862400,6,1600,4.520833333333333
1648511,4,B00005QJHL,"The worst thing I can say about Wingspan is that the title is misleading.  I suspect McCartney and his daughter intended to make a documentary about Wings but ended up with one about Paul and Linda instead.  But that's okay, although they should have changed the name of the DVD.

The best feature of Wingspan is that Paul, for once, is remarkably articulate in the interview sections.  The questions are more intimate than you might expect from his own daughter, too.  It can't have been easy for him to talk with her about such issues as the drug bust in Japan - but he does it, apparently quite honestly.  I also loved the early films and stories of the retreat in Scotland immediately before and after the Beatles broke up, and the first Wings tour.  The shots of the 1976 American tour are also terrific - if there's enough footage of those shows for a full-length DVD, everyone who sees this will want to buy it.  Just sayin', guys.  While most fans will already know some of the stories he tells, there are several here that I've never heard before, notably the origin of ""Mrs. Vanderbilt"" and the reggae bridge in ""Live and Let Die.""  I also came away with a lot more respect for Linda after watching this, even if the fact remains that she couldn't sing.

What's not so good is the discussion of the other members of Wings and the band's work as a whole - which, after all, is apparently what the show was supposed to be about in the first place.  With occasional exceptions, the talk about the songs is fairly cursory, and this is even more true when it comes to the musicians.  Denny Laine, the only constant member of Wings besides Paul and Linda (and, on two occasions, the only other member of the band) doesn't get anywhere near the screen time he warrants.  Some of the other members literally only get one mention in passing.  Then again, that is an accurate reflection of how long they were in the group!  Their best-selling album, ""Wings at the Speed of Sound,"" isn't discussed at all and only about a minute's worth of it is even used as background music.  (I can't help wondering if this is Paul and Mary's way of acknowledging that, big as it was, it's not a very good album.)  During the segment on the 1976 tour, he recites a rather obnoxious nursery rhyme he made up in response to questions about a Beatles reunion - without ever mentioning that Ringo turned up at one of the shows and he seemed quite happy about it at the time.  I'd love to know why he left that out.

Overall, the good outweighs the bad.  Now, let's see about a full-length Wings concert DVD...",1124755200,3,2590,4.456475583864119
1648512,3,B00005QJHL,"This DVD is a good overview of Paul's career from 1970-1980. What it does have is some good interviews with his daughter Mary. We see archival footage from tours, interviews and videos. Extras include the videos for Rockestra (1979), Jet (1976, from Rockshow), and Let 'Em In (same source). There is also a photo gallery of 100 pictures from 1970-1980 of the various incarnations of Wings. This is also a moving tribute to Linda.

However, there are no interviews with other band members. The discography has an error on it. Near the end Paul states he took some time off to raise his kids after Wings broke up in 1981. This is not entirely true. He would release Tug of War, Pipes of Peace and Give My Regards to Broad Street between 1982-1984. Paul would do well to release a video collection onto DVD of various promo videos. I think even a collection covering the Wingspan CD, from 1970-1984, would have been a good start. Overall this is a good documentary, but far from the complete word on Paul's post Beatles career.",1113696000,,1024,4.626373626373627
1648513,3,B00005QJHL,"I like other reviewers felt that the video ""WINGSPAN"" was more about how he and Linda moved forward with their lives after the Beatles. After reading the book ""Linda McCartney: An Itimate Portrait"" I understood why the ""Wingspan"" video was the way it was. They did not delve much into the band, because honestly the only imput Paul really cared about was Linda's. In the book it was even intimated that it was an ""US"" (Paul and Linda) and then THEM(the band).Great for a marriage, not great for a band. Paul also does not go into why these musicians quite. The fact was they were not getting paid what they felt they deserved. And when two musicians went to Scotland to practice with them (and brought their wives), Linda told them that the wives should leave as this was business. Hmmm...wonder what Paul would have said if someone told him to leave Linda home.",1091923200,3,862,4.603896103896104
1648514,3,B00005QJHL,"I'll try to keep this one short and sweet...
Paul could have done more with ""Wingspan"" (in much the same way he could have done more with the CD release). It is clear that his intentions were not so much to tell the story about his band as they were to tell how he and Linda moved forward with their lives in the post-Beatles years (the 70's, that is).
Denny Lane and the others are given short shrift on 'Wingspan"". The various members of Wings come and go, but the focus remains on Paul and Linda. Paul really doesn't say all that much about any of the other members. It would have been nice if, at the end of the documentary, the viewer was given a little info on ""where are the former members of the band now?"". A little tribute to the late Jimmy McCulloch would have been cool... etc., etc.
Now, if you are a Paul McCartney and Wings fan, you WILL find this entertaining and worthwhile. It just could have been much more. The extra interview out-takes are, for the most part, not all that exciting. However, you do get to hear Paul sing ""Picasso's Last Words"" to his daughter. That would have been enough as far as ""out-takes"".... and the three videos included are cool. Included are two performances from the ""Wings Over America"" tour, which begs the question:
Why the heck isn't ""Rock Show"" available on DVD yet????",1089158400,5,1322,4.444444444444445
1648515,3,B00005QJHL,"Like most fans, I wish they could have found some more performance/video clips to include here (might've made this into something you'd watch more than once). And hearing Paul interviewed by his own daughter is a little... well it's sort of reminiscent of the printed ""self-interview"" he included with early pressings of _Ram_ - almost more of a self-serving monologue than anything else. As others have noted, the fact that he and Linda are the only people whose recollections are solicited really underscores how dubious the notion of this being an actual ""band"" was all along. Following this line of thought further, Sir Paul also fails to explain how this tight-knit ""family"" managed to burn through four drummers and three lead guitarists in seven years (though thankfully, he does credit Henry McCullough for his song-saving solo on ""My Love""). Still, this is the Big Mac we're talking about, so if you haven't contemplated these tunes in a while, or if you were around in the seventies, you may want to check this out.",1052524800,2,1025,4.930635838150289
1648516,2,B00005QJHL,"I wish Alister and Mary would have spent more time trying to find footage to make this documentary more complete.  If anyone has connections on how to get more newsreel and music video footage it would be Paul, and his daughter Mary and son-in-law Alister.
I have seen important Wings footage on MTV, etc. that was not included on this DVD.  For example:  Where is the Wings over the World footage when Ringo visits them backstage, and the 1976 Rockshow interview with a very confident sounding Paul?  How about the footage from the James Paul McCartney show where Wings plays several songs live?  How about the Rockestra band playing ""Lucille"" live during the Concert for Kampuchea? I have them playing that on my bootleg video, and Mary could not get it?  How about asking the detailed questions about the events in these videos?  They should have definitly interviewed Denny Lane!  Since he recently made a CD of old Wings hits, I'm sure he would have been available to answer a few questions from Mary.  Speaking of questions, Mary should have asked the more detailed and tougher questions.  Since she didn't do this, she shows me that she is not the biggest Wings fan out there, and she should have consulted her dad more about what questions would make this story sound complete in order to make this a world-class video like the Beatles Anthology.  Her questions only let us see the tip of the iceberg, and are nothing that any big Wings fan does not already know.
I have seen many, many Wings videos on bootleg tapes that would have fit nicely into this DVD, such as: Goodnight Tonight, and Mull of Kintyre.  Almost every video they showed on this DVD was cut and just partially shown.  They should have shown the entire length of all the ""good"" music videos, and shown partials of some of the ""mediocre"" ones.  Better yet, they should have archived ALL the videos in the Special Features section of the DVD.
I speculate that Paul just left everything in the hands of Alister and Mary and just let them do it all themselves, while he acted like executive producer and provided the majority of the funding for this DVD.  Mary is inexperienced and should have taken more time to do this right.
2/5 stars for this one.",1046390400,32,2223,4.635204081632653

Well, no actually she doesn't ask him a single hard-hitting question at all, but still if you're a fan of the band Wings -the masters of silly love songs, then this has some great footage.
Mary acts astounded upon hearing that John took Yoko into the Beatles recording sessions. I'm no single pigeon but I was astounded that she'd have us believe that she's only just heard this. Oh, well, live and let die!
Paul McCartney tries to re-write history - especially about the break-up of this band - which was actually caused when his long-time stalwart Denny Laine gave up on the project when McCartney got arrested in Japan. There was McCartney shouting Let 'em in!
Mary had a Little Lamb, & that's her dad. She treats him with kid-gloves in this rather then as the magneito & titanium man that we know him to be. I don't know what girl's school she went to but they didn't teach journalism there.

1648518,5,B00005QJHL,"It's almost insane to follow the Beatles success but Sir Paul tried and did great.  As you will see in Wingspan, Paul never lost his touch of writing, singing and playing his music.  As popular Band On the Run was, Paul continued with Venus & Mars, Speed of Sound all the way to London Town, ""Goodnight Tonight"", ""Coming Up"" and ""No More Lonely Nights"".  Remember, Paul's solo career certainly didn't end in 1980 when Wings dissolved after bthat Japan incident, Paul continued strong up to the present day.  But this is just a brief history on Wings (1972-1980), but it includes Give Me Regards To Broadstreet (1984).

I truly respect and admire the fact that Paul McCartney is a family man.  He wanted Linda at his side and encouraged her to be a part of his second successful band, Wings.  I like the way he wanted to share his life with her and that she also inspired some of the most beautiful love songs such as ""Maybe I'm Amazed,"" ""Just Another Day,"" and ""The Lovely Linda.""  The love he clearly had for Linda is touching and beautiful; everything he says about his late wife points up to a loving and nurturing union.
I love the May 2001 ""interview"" Paul had with his daughter, Mary.  I am somewhat reluctant to call their exchange an ""interview;"" rather, they were engaged in a conversation that just happened to be filmed for television.  I love the way Paul talked about Linda and how they wanted a family; the family film footage is what made this so much more captivating for me.

1648524,4,B00005QJHL,"For this ""rockumentary,"" Paul McCartney is interviewed by his daughter. He is very playful and relaxed, given his familiarity with the interviewer. At the beginning of the program we witness the dissolution of the Beatles and the marriage of Paul and Linda. Interestingly, none of the other Beatles were in attendance at the hastily arranged nuptials. Later, Paul wonders if he can make it as a solo artist. After releasing a couple of solo albums, he decides to form a new band. His wife Linda would be a member of the group, even though she had little musical experience. Paul admired Denny Laine's guitar playing and singing with the Moody Blues.  Denny was asked to join his new group Wings. As it turned out, Denny Laine was the ONLY member of Wings to stay with the group from start to finish, other than Linda. However, his musical contributions - what songs he wrote and sang on, or contributed a guitar solo to - are never discussed. Mr. Laine was not interviewed for this DVD, nor are any clips of old interviews with him included. Other band members are only mentioned in passing although, to be fair, most only lasted with Wings a short time.

As Paul said near the end of the program, he proved that he could have major hits and successful world tours with another band after the Beatles. After Paul's infamous drug bust in Japan, he felt that it was time to give everything a rest. Thus Wings ended, not with a bang but with a whimper. Surprisingly, there is no booklet or even an insert included with the DVD. The extras include complete live performances of two songs - ""Jet"" and ""Let 'Em In"" - as well as the studio session for the instrumental ""Rockestra."" The discography contains mistakes; when you click on the song list for ""Wings Over America"" it displays the song list for ""Wings At The Speed Of Sound."" A little more attention to detail and interviews with other band members could easily have made this a 5 star DVD.",1010361600,31,1942,4.593659942363113
1648525,5,B00005QJHL,"I bought this DVD because I would buy anything with Paul McCartney on it.  I specially liked the relaxed pace of the interview. Of course there are more questions unanswered, but hey, it's a life in the making, right?  There are more documentaries coming... the one where he tells how he met and married Heather Mills, etc. (Paul, please do this one soon!)
One thing I found particularly uncanny is the fact that Mary McCartney looks a lot like that girl in Help, the one after the ring, remember? at least I think so.
Anyway, I highly recommend buying this DVD.",1009756800,,562,4.554455445544554

Call it the McCartneys in the 70's.

7950581,1,B00005QJHL,"I rarely write one star revues, but this DVD is really a tepid look at a ten year period in Paul McCartney's career.  It is a story told time and time again only this time it was acted out with'film clips' (most likely found in the The Beatles Anthology as well) and a recent interview with Paul and Mary (I think.  Nowhere on the cover does it say who the interviewer is).  The cover makes the disc seem so exciting with the bait of special features, outtakes, etc.  The ending leaves the viewer wondering to what happened to Linda.  There is a considerable amount regarding her and her courtship with Paul from the beginning.  Why not the end?.  Not to be too biased, I am approaching 60 myself, and I have followed all the Beatles careers (come on Ringo, STOP already).  I saw the Wings Over America concert in San Diego and it was absolutely awesome.  By then the kinks had been ironed out and the show was a very professional, entertaining, exiting, etc. So here you have a dryly told 10 year period of Sir Paul McCartney.  (ps did Linda use tapes in concerts?  There was no Auto-Tune back then).",1507680000,,1101,4.4278606965174125
7950582,1,B00005QJHL,"I thought this was supposed to be a documentary about the band Wings, but in fact, it is really the story of Paul and Linda McCartney's marriage. That's fine, but why call it Wingspan? There is next to nothing about the other members of the band, other than saying ""so and so left and so and so replaced him"". None of the other band members are interviewed - just Paul (and Linda in archive footage). We don't learn anything about how the other members felt about being in a band with a Beatle, or what they contributed to the band. It's true that Paul was the leader, main songwriter, and singer, but he surrounded himself with a good team. Denny Seiwell was a solid drummer that had played on many studio sessions with other artists; Henry McCullough was a bluesy guitarist who should be remembered for his classic solo on Paul's ""My Love"". He was replaced by Jimmy McCulloch, a genius/prodigy who should have become a superstar, were it not for his fatal addictions to drugs and alcohol. His playing was a highlight of the 1975-76 Wings world tour, and he wrote one of the best non-McCartney Wings songs, Medicine Jar. Denny Laine, the only member to stay in the band the full ten years besides Paul and Linda, was a gifted multi-instrumentalist (guitar, bass, piano, keyboards, blues harp) who wrote and sang many of the songs on the albums. He should have been included in the interviews - obviously, Paul respected him back in the day to have him as his songwriting partner and harmony singer for 10 years. Joe English was an excellent drummer that really enhanced the feel of the songs when done live. And we don't learn anything in this dvd about the final lineup of the band, that included Steve Holley on drums, and Laurence Juber on guitar. What this dvd is a testament to is Paul's tremendous ego. He can't find it in himself to give credit to any of his bandmates, except Linda, and of course she was not a professional musician before being drafted into Wings. I accept that Paul needed her there, for moral support, but no one believes that she was the secret to Wings' success. If you want to get a Wings dvd, Rock Show is a much better starting place - just 2 hours of the band onstage rocking!",1465776000,,2211,4.516209476309227
