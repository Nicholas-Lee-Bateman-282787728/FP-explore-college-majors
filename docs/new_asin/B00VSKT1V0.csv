7107362,5,B00VSKT1V0,"Great season, great dvd. Adventure Time Forever featurette was great and I didn't see the animatic clips yet, but they will probably be good. My only problem is that I couldn't find the special snail hunt extra. I only have a problem with this because it was advertised and its not there. But the extras aren't what makes this season great anyway. This dvd is probably more worth it than the others because it has 52 episodes instead of 26 and this when the show really starts to pick up.(I still recommend watching the show in order though.) 52 episodes of just greatness. Get it. Now.
Update: I found the snail hunt extra! It's hidden though (that's why its a hunt I guess). I forget which disc its on but basically when you find it, it has pictures from behind the scenes of the show playing with music in the background.",1437004800,2,824,4.4635761589403975
7107363,5,B00VSKT1V0,"Amazing show, amazing season, amazing everything. My only complaint: why no commentary this time?? I miss everyone's thoughts about the show, even though I know it drove them crazy to do all those recordings... Still, I loved them, and now I miss them. Highly recommend- the show only continues to get better as time goes on.",1436832000,,325,4.821428571428571
7107364,5,B00VSKT1V0,"There are very few shows that get better and better as they get older. Usually, a show has a killer first or second season, then coasts on its former glory, only to peter out. ""Adventure Time"" is not that kind of show. I fell in love with the first season, but ""Adventure Time"" is the only show I can think of that continues to reward its viewers season after season with wonderful content that bests what came the year before!

Season 5 is nuts. This year (or rather, year and a half) of television was phenomenal. Over the span of 52 episodes, ""Adventure Time"" explored many of the great characters that have made this series so fun and wonderful. Let's start at the beginning. I remember eagerly awaiting the premiere, considering what a massive cliffhanger the show had been left on. I was not disappointed. Not only were introduced to (spoiler alert) dimension hopping, but also Prismo, voiced by the fantastic Kumail Nanjiani.

While the entire season is good to great, the first part of the season really contains some gems. For instance, ""Bad Little Boy"" allows us to revisit the realm of the Ice King's fan fiction creations, Fionna and Cake, but this time, we get to meet Marshall Lee (Marceline's counterpart). Speaking of Marceline, this part of the season contains what very well might be the best episode the show has ever aired: ""Simon & Marcy"". If you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about, and if you haven't, I don't want to spoil anything.

And how can anyone forget about ""A Glitch is a Glitch"", the first episode of ""Adventure Time"" that would be guest directed by someone, in this case, David OReilly, who brings his trademark glitch style to the show we all love. Oh! Oh! And what about ""Puhoy""!! I could go on and on. The middle part of the season features a few silly, ridiculous episodes (""James Baxter the Horse"" instantly springs to mind), but also some thought provoking ones (like the religion v. science theme in ""Wizards Only, Fools""). The fans of the series generally refer to the first half of season 5 as ""5.1"" and the second half as ""5.2"". If 5.1 was good, 5.2 is amazing.

There are so many great episodes near the season's tail-end... Too many to name. It was during this time that the series started to really explore the darkness inherent in the show. Heavy topics like breakups (""Frost & Fire""), repressed memories and reincarnation (""The Vault""), reuniting with lost love ones only for them to disappear once again (""Betty""), and earth-shattering familial revelations (""Billy's Bucket List"") were all equally explored between episodes that discussed an elephant and a pig getting married (""Apple Wedding""), Marceline getting super hangry (""Red Starved""), and BMO learning of its origins (""Be More"").

And of course, I never thought the show could out-do the season four cliffhanger, but the aforementioned ""Billy's Bucket List"" does just that. I remember watching it airing and counting the days until the season six premiere. Good times.

There is so much to say about this season, but I will condense everything down into this one statement: if you are a fan of ""Adventure Time"", buy this DVD/Blu-ray set!

UPDATE 7/14/15: I just got the DVD today in the mail, and I wanted to include a brief note about the special features... or rather, the lack thereof. There's a mini documentary about the popularity of the show (which features the crew), and the DVD also includes short animatic snippets, but that's it. There is nary a commentary in sight. That kinda bums me out a bit, but to be fair, they are called extras for a reason. The season itself is well worth the money, I just wish we would've gotten some commentary on, say ""Simon & Marcy"" or ""Puhoy"" or ""Sky Witch"" or something. I'd still give it five stars, just because the episodes are math.",1428710400,40,4810,4.834750911300121

The detailed storyline is also something else! I really enjoy connecting dots from past episodes, sometimes bits of story that are a few seasons in existence.

Unlike previous seasons, the disc set for season five has twice the number of episodes in it. There are fifty-two action packed and wacky episodes in this collection.  There are shows about love, breaking up, getting married and becoming parents.  This season has it all!

Even though Jake and Rainicorn become parents in this season, they are not the ones getting married.  That honor goes to Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig and it's officiated by the king of Ooo.  Princess Bubblegum doesn't like this impostor king and nearly ruins the wedding trying to discredit him.

Finn still has feelings for Princess Bubblegum and tries to woo her after his relationship with the Flame Princess goes cold.  Speaking of cold, the Ice King makes many appearances this season as he is living with Finn and Jake since they destroyed his ice castle in the previous season.

There are many flash backs regarding him and his attempts at raising Marceline and keeping his sanity while wielding the power of his crown.  True to his corrupted self, he still kidnaps princesses and tries to get them to marry him.  *spoiler alert* When those attempts fail, he marries his foot instead. /*spoiler alert*

In case you haven't noticed, these episodes are just as wacky as ever.  Sadly, in this season there some episodes that go against Christian values and teachings. In the episode The Suitor Peppermint Butler uses dark magic and summons a demon to take control of Cinnamon Bun.  Reincarnation is also introduced in the episode The Vault where Finn helps solve a mystery from his former life as a girl named Shoko.  The cartoon violence and potty humor from seasons past is still a given.

Christian parents may want to screen these episodes before letting their kids watch them.  If the moral issues are of no concern, the humor is just as wacky and this set is sure to crack many smiles and giggles.  The Blu-ray currently sells for $32 and the DVD bundle is less than $25.  Fans of the show will find plenty of value in owning these episodes.",1438387200,,2085,4.741666666666666

7107526,5,B00VSKT1V0,"This is the best season of adventure time it includes 52 episodes! Under Jake's slipcover is him eating  a sandwich, it has four discs: disc 1=13episodes and adventure time forever featurette, disc 2=13 episodes, disc3=13 episodes, disc 4=13episodes.
All the episodes have short clips of each episode. There are NO commentarys this time. Some people are saying there is no special snail hunt extra but there is think about it snail hunt obviously you have to look for a snail, the snail is on disc 4 under episode 49 bad timing. So once you have clicked on the snail which should appear once press down on episode 49 in episode selection, it shows you a badly drawn animation of LSP saying thank you for following adventure time on Facebook. It gets weirder she then says you get a prize, then she opens her mouth and shows you inside. Weird. The packaging was a little damaged but it's fine.",1438041600,2,892,4.6455696202531644

As a fan of this series, I was so impressed to find not only all of the episodes (as there were so many), but also the additional bonus features that were on it made it unique and special too! That being said, my daughters' and my favorite episode by far has to be James Baxter The Horse. I cannot pinpoint why we like it as much as we do, we just do(It probably has to do something with how ridiculous the episode was!). Best of all was the value of this. For as many episodes that were on this, the true collector will be able to get this without breaking the bank. Get ready to hold your sides laughing in many of these 52 episodes that include:

7107529,5,B00VSKT1V0,"To call this season of Adventure Time unique would be an understatement. I stopped counting the number of times I and my wife asked ""what the heck is going on"" or the speachles glances we gave one another during especially awkward moments in the show. What I can say is the show hit a stride this season. All of the primary characters have had their back-stories flushed out over the last few seasons, so here is where the stories are allowed to divert from what is known and completely avoid predictible twists and turns.

There are plenty of references to previous story lines for rabid fans, and many things which seemed unrelated are connected in a meaningful way. We continue to develop our patient love for the person who is now the Ice King, and we discover more and more about the history behind the creation of Ooh. It's a very wacky, very silly, very thoughtful and very enjoyable continuation of a great series.",1437523200,,922,4.621951219512195
7107530,1,B00VSKT1V0,Great show but I returned my blu Ray copy because it was having the same issue with the menu not coming up.

7107532,2,B00VSKT1V0,"One of my favorite shows, and arguably the best season of the show. However, the lack of commentaries on this DVD is kind of devastating for the longtime fan.

With previous seasons, I loved getting to revisit each episode with a spotlight put on the storyboard artists responsible for its creation. Pen Ward and his team were often funny, insightful, and dripping with personality on the DVDs. But without them, you're just getting the same experience of watching the show normally, except now you're putting a hunk of plastic into something that can play DVDs first.

In the age of streaming sites, there's no reason to own a DVD unless it's providing some special inside content like that. I can understand the team might have been too busy to sit down and comment on all 52 episodes, but it's sad nonetheless. I can enjoy this purchase for collector reasons, for its typically great packaging, and as a way to support the show, but I don't know how much I'll actually use the DVDs. Hopefully the commentaries return in the future!",1437350400,4,1034,4.738888888888889

Had to send it back for a new copy, hopefully one that works.

Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because i didn't get a working copy from the get go.",1437004800,3,494,4.15625
