5851809,5,B00DS79HJW,"Joseph Morgan's performance in this mental thriller is astounding. Having almost no one else to play off of for the entire film, he still manages to clearly and oh-so-believably convey every emotion that his character goes through - confusion, horror, fury, fear, despair, contempt, hope, triumph, boredom, grief, and more. It is an amazing accomplishment. As for the story itself, it is a well-written teaser that will keep you guessing until the very end. How did AJ get in the house? Will he escape? Who was there before him? Who/what are these strange mindless creatures who attack him every day? Armistice is a must-watch for any fan of the psychological thriller, and certainly for any Joseph Morgan fan.",1399593600,5,710,5.02542372881356
5851810,3,B00DS79HJW,"The premise is promising and interesting, but It probably would have worked better in a condensed time format.  There is just not enough content to warrant a feature length movie.  The sum of the picture could have been expressed in :30 minutes.",1396310400,,245,4.809523809523809
5851811,3,B00DS79HJW,Can't quite know what to make of a really ordinary house with the God-like capabilities of resurrecting the dead; repairing itself; yet be ordinary in every other respect e.g you can dig out of it but you can't see out of it's windows? Why a dying soldier should suddenly be there rather in the field that he's actually dying in; why a former dead soldier is now an undead type trying to kill him; why there was just only one former captive of the house who leaves a pretty crude record of his escape attempts and dealing with the same undead person. If there's a message in this movie it could have been written & directed to utilize this 90 minutes with more clarity; with fewer flashbacks; with fewer daily really mundane killings.,1395532800,,734,4.526315789473684
5851812,3,B00DS79HJW,"Cool idea, perhaps it could have Been better if the house was a real place where he was trapped.  Maybe?",1393372800,,104,4.2
5851813,5,B00DS79HJW,I loved this movie. I wanted to see this movie because I am I big fan of Joseph Morgan but was hooked immediately. I too figured out the purpose of the house and the Fallen but I continued to root for Joseph's character. In the end he made the decision I was hoping. This is a must watch!!!,1392681600,3,290,4.017241379310345
5851814,5,B00DS79HJW,"Armistice is a must-see movie. There are only 3 characters, but their development throughout the story makes each one larger and more diverse than you can imagine at the beginning. I had figured out the purpose of the warhouse before watching it, so I was rooting for a specific ending even as I saw what the likely outcome would be. The ending I was dreading came and I realized it was the only outcome that could have truly honored the main character's journey.

Joseph Morgan dissolves himself into AJ Budd, a Royal marine who wakes to find himself in the warhouse with no way out. He draws you into the madness, ensuring you can't look away each time he battles The Fallen. Sometimes you may laugh (like when he spanks the creature as it drowns in the bathtub) even while some may be grossed out by the oozing (when he captures and questions the creature) and sometimes momentarily sickened by the violence of the first unexpected battles. As AJ Budd adapts to the warhouse's rules then devolves through the days, I couldn't help but wonder how I would react were I locked in such a place. I'm a fan of Joseph's work in other movies and tv shows, and I enjoy his ability to give such life to his character's that I forget it is him playing the part.

Matt Ryan gives us Edward Sterling, appearing in flashbacks as told through a journal he has left in the warhouse for future inhabitants to find. His writings are almost calming at first, as we learn AJ Budd is not the only soldier who has been tormented by the warhouse. As Sterling's story is told, we see the continued effects of the torment and solitude matched with what Budd is experiencing. Matt's portrayal is so wonderful that I almost missed the signs of Sterling's eventual fate because I held tight to the brave soul heard in the first words he speaks.

William Troughton plays The Fallen, a creature that seems vaguely human in shape but is a monster that makes the warhouse brutal. Every day The Fallen appears and we root for its death, though once I learned its origin I couldn't help but think back to the battles and find the small human pieces within the creature.

Luke Massey directed and co-wrote Armistice with Benjamin Read. Though I figured out the purpose of the warhouse ahead of time, the story and the way it is told drew me in so completely that several times I questioned if I was right or completely wrong. The truth within the suffering created by the warhouse can be attributed to anyone who has struggled with an impossible situation. Many have existed in the warhouse before us, but we get to make our own choice as we struggle for answers. The contrasting images of AJ Budd's reality within the warhouse with the momentary flashes of his dreams intensifies the feelings evoked when you realize the meaning of the warhouse and the fate of all three characters at the end. I applaud Luke and Benjamin for their story and ability to create such emotion with two characters living within solitude, a creature that is as much a victim as the tortured soldiers it attacks, and a house that encompases all by giving as much as it is taking.

I've been waiting to see Armistice for so long and it gave me more than I expected. It reflected back on myself and has left me considering my own warhouse. I encourage you to watch and really consider what you saw. Be sure to watch through the credits, for there is a scene after the credits finish that adds an exclaimation point.",1390176000,11,3459,4.545746388443018
5851825,4,B00DS79HJW,"This is an interesting movie.  It'll never be a ""classic"", but if you are a Joseph Morgan fan, you will like it.  He gives a great performance as the trapped man, especially considering he only has himself to keep the action and dialogue moving.",1426723200,,245,4.545454545454546
5851826,2,B00DS79HJW,"I love Joseph Morgan, that is why I got the DVD, but the movie itself just was not of my liking. Still, his acting is great!",1424563200,,124,3.8076923076923075
5851827,5,B00DS79HJW,I think this is a great movie. I'm a fan of Joseph Morgan and I knew I just had to see this. Everyone has their own opinion. Some like it some will not. I think in every movie Morgan plays in he does a spectacular job. I know it seems like he might not be doing anything for like an hour buy you just have to understand what's going on.,1419811200,,336,3.8142857142857145
5851828,5,B00DS79HJW,"Armistice is a mentally penetrating suspenseful story that tells of a soldier's confinement in a strange house from where he cannot escape.  During this inexplicable tenure, he is met with a horribly hideous and mindless creature whose sole job is to kill.  Day after day, the soldier, Royal Marine A.J. Budd, portrayed by The Originals' Joseph Morgan, is met with this consistently heinous circumstance and must fight for his survival - or he will be killed.

Too many so-called thrillers that have constant and continual cliff-hangers seem to typically, or stereotypically, have the hero or heroine do really stupid stuff and make very bad decisions.  GEICO even joked about it in one of their commercials.  It is as if young people have no intelligence, common sense, or a sense of logic to figure out a way to remove themselves from their horrible situations.  Ill be right back!  Famous last words, right?  Not this movie.  A.J. Budd has a brain and isn't afraid to use it  and use it, he certainly does.

The feeling of being trapped and having to fight for your life everyday doesnt seem to give one hope.  And there it is!  Hope!  That is the key and that is the way and that is ruin of the ability to go on.  A.J. is determined and has this hope, but with his daily routine, does it help or does it hurt?
The calm nature of the movie is eerily chilling, yet somewhat sad.  It is intelligent and thought-provoking, and it makes you easily put yourself in A.J.s shoes, wondering what you would do to get yourself out of the corner in which youd been forcibly painted.

It is very refreshing to see a character  two, actually  in a movie who has nothing to rely upon except their intellect and brilliantly use it to their advantage.

Matt Ryans remarkable performance of Lieutenant Edward Sterling, chronicling a written account of his time in the house, which gives A.J. the impression of a sense of positivity and hope, makes you wonder for which man you should feel sorrier.

Josephs portrayal of A.J. is, simply, believable and splendidly genuine. His acting talent prevails in allowing the audience to feel what A.J. feels.  His character attempts a normal life, but it doesnt go as he anticipates. Seeking answers becomes another way out.  On the other hand, after a certain point, does it really matter why?  The feeling of being trapped and having to fight for your life on a daily basis makes A.J. more determined to surpass Edwards efforts.

Armistice plays on your intellect.  It incites and rouses the mind into planning right along with A.J. and Edward.  And it feels as if the writers, Benjamin Read and Luke Massey, concocted this semi epic story in response to their astute observation of victim behavior in horror movies.  It clearly shows how cerebral they were in their creation of such a sharp narrative.  This movie is definitely worth the cost of admission, price of the DVD and Blu-ray.  It easily thrills, entertains, and satisfies.",1419638400,,2962,4.750980392156863
5851829,4,B00DS79HJW,"First and most important of all, this movie is not for everyone. Second, Joseph Morgan, pulls off, for all intents and purposes a one man movie (2 other characters show up now and then and one is unrecognizable and the other a few flashbacks) This is a strange movie and one with very little dialog too. This soldier wakes up in an inescapable house and once a day he is attacked by some creature, he gets the same food appearing on the kitchen table and everything fixes itself.  I think I did figure it out but I won't say in deference to anyone who may get it. I admit I did fast forward a few times but the performance of Joseph Morgan is riveting and deserves the look.",1416873600,,674,4.265625

5851831,2,B00DS79HJW,"I watched it because of the actor. I'm actually surprised I managed to get through the whole movie. Without the description, going into the movie, I would have had no idea what the movie was about. The directing is strange. Now that I've seen all of it, I may or may not understand. My best guess is the movie is some strange psychological evaluation. I have to stretch any justification for the movie name.",1414800000,,407,4.513513513513513
5851832,2,B00DS79HJW,I'm a big fan of Joseph Morgan but this movie I didn't get. How did he end up in the house?  And did he go through the door? I'm glad this movie only cost me 2.99 money I'll never see again,1410566400,,189,3.6097560975609757
5851833,2,B00DS79HJW,"I love Joseph Morgan, and his superb acting is the only thing giving this movie 2 stars. The script was painfully dull and entirely predictable in the first ten minutes. What follows that is an hour and ten minutes of basically no dialogue. It's a shame, it had potential, but lacked decent writing to even make me care about the characters plight.",1408406400,,348,4.629032258064516
5851834,4,B00DS79HJW,"The movie was obviously not high budget by Hollywood standards, yet, Morgan was able to pull me into the material and make me care about his character. The special effects really aren't special but if you can get passed that it is a good film.",1402963200,,243,4.4222222222222225
8596951,5,B00DS79HJW,"This is a different sort of movie than most that are out there. Where it is billed as a thriller( make that a psychological thriller) it does require some deep thought on the viewers' part. What you get out of it will depend on your own point of view about the idea that is presented here. I do not want to give the premise of the movie  away as it should just unfold and draw you in slowly and completely.  It unfolds gradually and there are only three (3) actors so no really much dialogue to speak of. It holds your attention as you try to figure out exactly what it is about and what it is that is going on. Some people out there will figure it out fairly quick; Other folks not so quick. And when you do figure out what it is really about it will be your beliefs and viewpoint on the subject matter that will determine whether or not you like the movie or not. For some a little unsettling for sure. For others definitely not enough explosions and gun battles. I liked it and found it to be very interesting point of view on the subject matter. Though the reason I bought this movie is that actor Matt Ryan is in it and I really enjoy his work. Yes, even this tragic and unsettling portrayal of WWII officer Edward Sterling. Not the type of movie to watch when you are just looking for some back ground noise-- to get the most out of it give it your full attention.",1519084800,,1370,4.166037735849057
