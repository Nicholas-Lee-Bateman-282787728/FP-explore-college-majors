8352369,5,B002697B46,"One of the most exciting new techniques to come out of the face and body art industry in the last several years is the use of a multi-colored 'split cakes.' Rebecca is often regarded as the 'mother of the art form' so you'll be learning from the best of the best. Split cake designs (and she has her own line of specialty split cakes in over 40 different color combinations!) are a true time saver and are used in some of our best selling designs -- so we find its imperative to have an understanding of how to use the split cake product effectively. Rebecca walks you through the basic strokes in the first part of the DVD then incorporates them into complete designs in the second half. This is money well spent!
