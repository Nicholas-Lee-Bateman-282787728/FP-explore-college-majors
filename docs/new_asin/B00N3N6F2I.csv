6608722,3,B00N3N6F2I,"I watched this documentary because I had questions about the biblical view of women and to help others understand that the bible is not sexist.
The film talks a great deal of Mary which I did not know much about or things that I just glossed over. The main point was that Jesus loved Mary for her faith and devotion. Also, she was more attuned to Jesus than the disciples, seeing things that the disciples failed to see.

The second part of the movie abruptly goes into the Fatima miracle [...] and its prophecies. I have heard about it but did not really know about the specifics. It was informative.

The documentary could have been much better if it talked about Ruth, Esther, Deborah and other females.

If the get rid of the second half of the movie and would make this a serried and actually discuss other women of the bible like Ruth, Esther, Hanna, Pricila, etc. The list of remarkable women in the bible can go on. They could of course also discuss the not so good role models of women, but I believe the would already have their handful just focusing on the good ones.",1466812800,4,1078,4.434343434343434
6608723,5,B00N3N6F2I,"Mary Magdalene was not who many church leaders over the years claimed her to be.  This was a revelation to me that I found quite interesting. All of these women are presented in the context of their culture and what they likely had to endure during that time in history, It is remarkable how strong these women were and what courage they had  .",1466208000,,344,4.359375

6608739,2,B00N3N6F2I,"The tile is very deceiving, it only talks about Mary Magdalene. That first part is great. The second half of the movie takes a wrong turn and is dedicated to the apparition of a being of light (that is later worshiped) and begins to discuss non biblical themes. Let us remember that the devil, the great deceiver can disguise itself as an angle of light which an appear to be good, but the bible says in John 14:6  ""Jesus answered, ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me"" which mean the worship of anything other than God is against biblical teachings, and the being of light therefore could not be a messenger of God.

6608758,3,B00N3N6F2I,"My experiences in Seminary exposed me to the ERA agenda of revisionist history regarding early Christianity and the women surrounding Biblical accounts of Christ's Ministry and later missions established by Paul and Peter, James and John, Mary Magdalene et.al.  Much speculation has been written about5 Jesus' relationships with women and what that means in post-modernist terms.  Those academicians who want to redefine women's role in the early Church don't necessarily rely on the facts per se, but often on wishful speculation and reading into historical accounts which can neither be proven nor disproved.  Wishful thinking seems to bee the basis of much of this speculation and as a serious student of the Bible and a Reverend; my conjecture is every age comes to a contemporary redefinition of the Scriptures.",1445299200,,816,5.310077519379845
