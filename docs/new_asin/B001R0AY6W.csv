3772479,1,B001R0AY6W,If you buy all the seasons from amazon including the preorder for season 11 you get it cheaper then buying the whole set for the $300. I wish people luck if price matching and finding the best possible price.,1238284800,8,208,4.358974358974359

8337094,4,B001R0AY6W,I was really pleased with what I got!! I was surprised that I could find seasons 1-10 in such good condition and for a great price!!,1291507200,,132,4.115384615384615
8337095,1,B001R0AY6W,"I ordered ER the complete Seasons 1-10 over 2 1/2 weeks ago.  I tried reaching this seller, as did Amazon, in regards to the status on my shipment 3 times.  When I finally received it today, it arrived in a torn up box that even the US POST OFFICE had to label it with a sticker that read...RECEIVED IN DAMAGED CONDITION!!!  When I opened the box only Seasons 3, 4 and 10 were in there.  Missing was Seasons 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.  What the heck???  I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY TO ANYONE!!!  Now I am having to wait till this is resolved.  I am sooooo UPSET!!!",1266796800,3,569,4.063063063063063

Hard to believe I got 10 seasons of ER for such a small cost.  They are bound to be good.  I haven't watched them yet,but have no doubt they will be wonderful.  Thank you!!!",1241395200,3,347,7.214285714285714
8337097,5,B001R0AY6W,"This is a great series. Of course the earlier seasons are the absolute best, but if you keep the basic premise in mind (emergency room) and don't focus on the character changes - then the later seasons are good too!
It is fun to see it all from the beginning again, remembering how relationships developed and how things have changed.",1241308800,4,334,4.583333333333333
8337098,1,B001R0AY6W,"Anyone who buys this product for $300 is an idiot for wasting their money. If you buy Seasons 1-10 separately, you will save about $95. You still get the same products, but for $100 cheaper! Don't be a sucker!",1238976000,2,209,4.384615384615385

8337100,2,B001R0AY6W,"Just more whiney, wimpering pablum from the networks and namely NBC. How much whining can take place in 11 years????? Dwelling on chosen social issues and political correctness got old after the third season. And to top it off just HOW much clooney and his self righteousness can we take.",1238630400,6,288,4.78
8337101,5,B001R0AY6W,"Sadly, someone actually gave this show a one star rating because of it's regular bundle price. Today 4/2/09 it's offer as a Gold Box item. I just hope people seeing the lack of stars will know that it is due to the regular price for the bundle and not the quality of the show. I'd hate to think of people not buying this show and missing out the many hours of high quality entertainment it can bring because of rating the price alone.

This show has seen some big name stars come and go but, it always has been on of the most entertaining and satisfying shows i have ever watched.  I count it among one of my very favorites and would not hesitate to recommend it to others.",1238630400,24,673,4.209302325581396
