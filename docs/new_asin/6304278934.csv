7867136,5,6304278934,"This plan is literally, a lifesaver.  I was reluctant to try it, but the price for the video and the program were impossible to resist.  This was one of the rare times when not resisting temptation was actually a good thing.  Unlike high protein, low fat and no carb diets this plan allows fat and carbs. What it doesn't allow is processed white flour, sugar and high glycemic carbohydrates like potatoes. It's a matter of eating your carbs, fruits and protein and fats in the right combination.  Not only do I eat more fruits and vegetables now than I ever did before, I am NEVER hungry and in just 9 days have lost 7 lbs! I haven't had one withdrawl symptom and I noticed an increase in my energy level and a dip in my appetite almost immediately. However, what was even more amazing was that the irritable bowl problem I was diagnosed with over 5 years ago has disappeared...and we are talking literally overnight. If for no other reason I would continue on this eating plan.  This is not a diet.  I can easily stay on this plan for life.  And even better, once you have reached your goal weight, Suzanne's plan allows a reintroduction of those ""forbidden"" foods like potatoes.  She just shows you the smart way to do it. Thank you, Suzanne. Do yourself a favor, purchase this.  This is a win-win situation all around.",1028246400,99,1321,4.516806722689076
7867137,5,6304278934,"My husband and I have been  somerzing for about a month and have lost around twenty pounds each. We love it! I don't feel that I am dieting and my blood sugar has leveled  off completely. Suzanne inspires you with her  common sense, honesty and sense of fun. Her video is inforrmative and  really explains the diet. You get two videos and two audio tapes and a  pocket guide and pamphlet. We had also purchased her books.  It is a diet  you can live on for the rest of your skinny life. Thanks Suzanne.",959904000,229,502,4.276595744680851
7867138,5,6304278934,"The tapes have an amaturish quality.  They aren't all slick and glossy.  That said.  They work. The principles are explained fully, the plan is easy to follow whether you eat at home or a fast food joint or a five star  resturant. One tape contains easy to do exercies - think Tai Chi, and a  serious talk about feeling good about yourself. When I bought this package  I also bought Get Skinny Eating Fabulous Foods.  It contains great recipes  and pep talks to keep you motivated. In three months I lost 40 pounds.",953251200,180,515,4.462365591397849
