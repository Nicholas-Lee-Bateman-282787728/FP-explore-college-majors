8299079,1,B000I0QMUY,There is only 2 tutorials and this information is available from After Effect. This young boy displays everything he doesn't know about AE. There are many places to find great tutorials for AE and this is not one of them. Chris and Trish Meyer have in depth books out with footage that are great. Total Traing is another good resource for AE training. Save your money and don't buy this junk.,1238457600,2,392,4.535211267605634
8299080,1,B000I0QMUY,"What a waste of money watching this dvd, the three tutorials in this dvd, aren't bad  (i admitt), but why print a dvd for this simple tutorials? it's a waste of time.

-if you are a pro, it's very simple
-if you are intermediate, it doesn't teach you a big thing
-if you are a beginner, you are lost, because you have to know AFX well to follow the tutorial.

it doesnt fit in any category not beginner not pros.

besides after 20 minutes you get sleep, because the speech lacks of dynamics.

i better stick to total training tutorials, they know their work pretty well.",1216598400,3,570,4.339622641509434
