3510701,5,B001CDLATO,"This new DVD is a must-have, not only for Doris Day fans but for everyone who is inspired by the magic of the holiday season.  These three episodes culled from the three holiday episodes of the CBS smash hit ""The Doris Day Show"" will have you grinning ear to ear.

""The Doris Day Show"" ran on the Tiffany Network for five hugely popular years (1968 - 1973). There were three holiday-themed episodes (1969, 1970 and 1971) and they are combined in this fancy new release with lots of extras.  For those who already own the five seasons of the series, this is still a must have since the extras alone make it worth its weight in gold. Foremost among them is new commentary by Miss Day as well as newsreels, audio, other clips and the opportunity to have this all together for a most affordable price tag.

Each holiday episode has its own merits.  The 1969 episode brings Day and her television family (2 sons and her father) as well as her co-workers at Today's World, to her farm home for an old-fashioned Christmas. It is genuine, heartfelt and amusing. By the time of the 1970 episode, Day's character had relocated to a stunning apartment in San Francisco, over an Italian Restaurant run by Kaye Ballard and Bernie Koppell. She had also inherited a ""Scrooge-like"" neighbor, played by the beloved Billy DeWolfe. Her co-workers at the magazine (Rose Marie, Paul Smith and MacLean Stevenson) are again on-hand and the episode is very funny.  The highlight for me, however, is Day's sparkling rendition of ""Silver Bells"". Her ""pipes"" are in amazing condition and as she did the previous year, at the conclusion of the episode she directly addresses the viewing audience to wish them a happy holiday. It is so real, honest and genuinely moving. Few performers could get away with making it so natural, but Day does it brilliantly.

The final episode from the 1971-1972 season drops the warm and fuzzy family holiday spirit and involves the search for a killer who masquerades as Santa Claus. Thanks to Charles Nelson Reilly's guest performance it works for me. It's one of the better written episodes from the show's fourth season and Day, as always, is in good form as is the series' new supporting cast. Although Miss Day doesn't step out of character and wish the audience the holiday wish from the previous two years, she and Cy Bennett, her boss at Today's World, catch on television the previous episode with Day sending her holiday wishes, right before the set blows up after a bit of tongue in cheek exchange between Day and John Dehner who is a delight as Bennett.

The extras are beautifully presented and the entire package is up to the standard of the previous releases of the show's five seasons as well as Day's two CBS television musical specials.

You'll have wonderful memories after viewing this latest Doris Day release and keep it handy for viewing during a summer heat wave.  It's a guaranteed surefire way to keep cool.",1225238400,47,2938,4.720703125

******The Extras********

Loved the montage of newsreel footage. Seeing Doris at different premiers. If you are a Doris Day collector this is worth the price of the set.

Commentary.

It's wonderful to hear Doris, unfortunately the person she is with does not have the greatest interviewing skills. Instead of speaking with her he speaks at her. He does not have a conversation with Doris, instead he  makes comments about the show. Its obvious that a flood of memories are happening, but instead of tapping into them he sticks to facts about the show.",1218585600,97,1565,4.992307692307692

3510882,5,B001CDLATO,"I could not wait until CHRISTMAS MORNING to watch this delightful treat, so I put it on soon after midnight and started with the extras, everything from the ""Toys For Tots"" to her ""Christmas Greetings"". And her three Christmas Episodes were real pleasant Christmas treasures, In the first Christmas Episode, Doris is asked by her boss to try to keep the office Christmas party under control. On the second Christmas Episode, Doris tries to have a pleasant Christmas Party while trying not to bother and disturb her grouchy next door neighbor. In the third and last Christmas Episode, Doris goes about trying to solve a murder committed by a ""Santa Claus"" while trying to prove that the ""Santa Claus"" who was accused was not the one who did it.

This is an absolutely wonderful collective item for ""Doris Day"" fans. For the price you couldn't go wrong. But what I don't understand is why wasn't there a Christmas Episode during each season!. I've noticed that a lot of shows do/did not have a Christmas Episode/s or even any other Holiday episodes for the show during most or all of their run. I wonder if that is a writer's choice or the choice of someone else. I, for one, would be pulled in by a Holiday Episode. Those would include: Thanksgiving, Christmas, Valentine's Day and Easter. Of course for a show to have an Easter Episode it would have to sometimes run late into April.

This item is a very inexpensive way to at least start your Doris Day viewing, if not your collection. Once again, though this DVD does not contain any new shows. Doris day has not performed on a show since the ""1970's"" unless you count her animal show in the 1980's. And her last movie was: ""With Six You Get Egg Roll"". If you haven't bought this, don't wait to long. It might become popular for some reason and then the price of this selection may just go through the roof.",1395619200,3,1859,4.562874251497006

3510884,5,B001CDLATO,"Doris, more than ever as the years pass, seems to epitomize the spirit of Christmas as it used to be (along with Bing Crosby, Nat King Cole, Andy Williamson and a few select others). One only wishes this young lady could exist forever.",1386115200,,235,4.488372093023256

I wanted to like this more but it is kind of mish-mash of all things Doris Day,

 So here I am, reviewing my gift. First, this DVD has 3 Christmas themed episodes
 from 1969, 1970,1971, from ""The Doris Day Show'"" where Doris Day, family and friends
 sing nice Christmas songs,  I haven't seen her series in years and I was a avid viewer.
 Then we have vintage newsreels from the  '50's and 60's Doris Day awards ceremonies,
film premieres. Finally, we have her radio show in 1952 and I've never heard this before,
Doris Day has a wonderful voice for our favorite Christmas songs, what a voice.
I wish there was more.",1385683200,6,749,4.416058394160584

3510887,5,B001CDLATO,"I am glad that I purchased this DVD, however, I was slightly disappointed that it was not what I thought it would be.  I love Doris Day so I still give it a 5 star rating -- this DVD was okay!",1377129600,,192,3.682926829268293
3510888,1,B001CDLATO,Amazon was very good to refund our money.  I had expected a Christmas musical type show.  This was just an old tv show; and it was unpleasant quality and far too dated.,1361318400,3,168,4.21875
3510889,5,B001CDLATO,I remember seeing this first episode from her Christmas shows & thought it was great. I was so glad it has been released on a DVD with more of her Christmas shows. Great clean entertainment.,1357344000,,190,4.457142857142857
3510899,2,B001CDLATO,Quality was not good.  Enjoyed seeing her again but seemed choppy and not edited well.  Played on large screen might have affected the quality.,1324944000,,143,4.916666666666667
3510900,4,B001CDLATO,"Let me begin by saying that I bought this DVD because I am a fan of Christmas releases, and especially Christmas episodes of TV programs. I was not a fan of Doris Day and in fact knew very little of her.

Note here that I say ""was not."" Because after viewing this, I now am one.

Before I get too far into that, let me address the quality of the DVD itself: AMAZING. This isn't just a disc, but a--no better way of describing it--loving tribute. The extras alone would rate four stars: segments of a Day Christmas radio program, tons of old newsreels (including Christmas-themed ones for, for instance, Toys for Tots), a show commentary. Included with the audio extras are slide shows of Ms. Day throughout her career. Really fascinating, especially for someone with an interest in the history of broadcast entertainment in the United States.

The three Christmas episodes from ""The Doris Day Show"" are of the highest quality for holiday entertainment. The writing on these shows was great but what blew me away--particularly since I knew so little of her going in--was the absolute brilliance of Day as an actress. I am not one who is prone to superlative speech but Doris Day in this period of time is as good as any comedic actress that I've ever seen PERIOD. You could lift out her performances from these shows and drop them into any comedy series today and she'd flourish--she is just that charismatic and easy to watch. This is that much more surprising to me because this is a woman who cut her teeth doing old-time radio and Hayes-Code-era film.

It surprises me too, really, that this series isn't more highly-regarded in TV history. I suppose that the relatively brief run might have had something to do with personal problems that Day was having at the time (very long lawsuit involving a former manager). Another thing that I think might have hampered the show is an inconsistent thematic thrust. The three episodes are from 1969, 1970 and 1971, and there doesn't seem to be a lot of thread to tie them together.

Obviously this is a must-have for any Doris Day fan, but I also recommend it highly to anyone who is looking for a refreshing holiday journey through a bygone era that, when you watch it, won't actually feel outdated at all.",1324598400,9,2251,4.6457286432160805
3510901,5,B001CDLATO,"Firstly, this DVD LOOKS beautiful! The colors and crispness of the images are immaculate.
Secondly, Doris Day's natural talents always make her an engaging performer. The fact that
this DVD offers her only connection with Christmas material -- other than around 20 holiday
songs she recorded during the 1940s, '50s and '60s -- makes this special DVD extra-special.

Also, Doris actually sings on a couple of these episodes from her TV series ""The Doris Day Show""
and also offers new audio commentary on one of them. There's some fun co-stars too, such as
Rose Marie (from ""The Dick Van Dyke Show""), McLean Stevenson (later from ""M*A*S*H*""), Bernie
Kopell (from lots of classic TV shows like ""The Love Boat""), Kaye Ballard (""The Mothers-In-Law""),
Denver Pyle, Billy DeWolff, Charles Nelson Reilly and others.

Day is involved!",1322438400,3,918,5.195945945945946

3510903,4,B001CDLATO,"It is Doris afterall. What more needs to be said. These early videos of family life in the last century are, at once, simple yet charming.

3510904,2,B001CDLATO,"Many tv shows become dated and this is the case with this series.  It remained on the air due to the popularity of Doris and went through several transformations and co-stars.  Usually what makes a dated show interesting is the commentary in which people involved with the show share their memories and insights.  Unfortunately, Doris didn't seem to have any on the one show that did offer commentary (in fact she referred to a scene that was filmed in the city apartment as being the farmhouse).  Jim Pearson who shared the commentary with Doris Day did an excellent job under difficult circumstances. Doris Day seemed totally out of it. When asked how Rose Marie came to be on the show, Doris replied ""Because she is talented"". When asked if that was really her driving the car across the San Francisco bridge she said ""I'm not going to tell you"".  These were actually some of her most expansive answers. Numerous times when trying to engage her and asking her to share memories her response was that she was interested in listening to the show. I am a long time Doris Day fan and was hoping that she would share more of herself in the commentaries.  I usually enjoy her wardrobes but the mismatched color pairings and odd hats were unbecoming and dated rather than classic.",1290988800,3,1276,4.674107142857143

3510925,3,B001CDLATO,"I purchased this for my Mom. She and I are both big Doris Day fans.  I thought from the description that these were Doris Day Christmas specials like the variety shows that the big stars used to have at Christmas.

This is three Christmas shows from the Doris Day series.  One of them is pretty good. Another one is just cheesy. I don't remember if we watched the third one or not.

Next time, I will stick to buying Doris Day movies.  I have never gone wrong with those.",1231027200,14,471,4.247191011235955

3510928,5,B001CDLATO,"When you put Doris Day and Christmas Day together, you get one wonderful dvd, ""Doris Day: Christmas Memories"".  This dvd features three of her Christmas shows from her Doris Day television show, ""A Two Family Christmas"" from 1969, ""It's Christmas Time in the City"" from 1970 and ""Whodunnit Doris?"" from 1971. In ""It's Christmas Time in the City"", we get to hear Doris comment on this particular Christmas show, and Miss Day is delightful as she recalls memories from this show 38 years ago!

There are also bonus features starting with Doris Day newsreel footage. This is so great! There are vintage films of Doris helping the Marines with Toys For Tots, as well as movie premieres of ""Pillow Talk"", ""Midnight Lace"" and ""The Thrill of it All"". They even show the old Coconut Grove, where award ceremonies were held.

This bonus section lets you listen to some of the Holiday highlights from the 1952 ""The Doris Day Show"" radio program. They show some Doris Day photos as you listen.

Next comes a music montage called ""Silent Night"", where you can enjoy Doris singing some beautiful Christmas music. Last they show some Doris Day Christmas tv promos and original sponsor bumpers for the Doris Day Show.

These are all lovely Christmas memories of Miss Day and especially enjoyable are Miss Day's commentaries on ""It's Christmas Time in the City"". Doris Day makes Christmas Day one very Happy Holiday!",1225324800,50,1400,4.8655462184873945
