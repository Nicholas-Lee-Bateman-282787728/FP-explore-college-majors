7825059,3,6302372860,"At the same time Phil Collins' signature album ""No Jacket Required"" was at its peak, Atlantic Records released the ""No Jacket Required EP"".  This was a VHS compilation of the videos that were done for the singles that were to be released from the album.  On the ""No Jacket Required"" album, Collins puts together an album that had a ""fun"" element.  On the videos, this element is translated very nicely visually.  Although I'm not a huge fan of the music video, Phil Collins finds a way to make it work with his style and as a result was able to use the video to catapult himself to a superstar.

Videos fall into 3 categories - performance related, conceptual, and soundtrack. Performance related ones are basically when the band lip syncs in a pseudo live or studio set. They often were disappointing because for the most part, lip syncing is a bore to me and to see a band try to lip sync and give the impression they were live is a bore.  Phil finds a way around this with the ""Who Said I Would"" video.  Conceptual had the potential to entertain, but for the most part would spoil your vision of the song.  The nice thing about this is that Phil finds a way to make the conceptual work and still keep your imagination going.  So you might imagine the song having one meaning - then the video comes along and takes it away. The third kind is the absolute worst - soundtracks. This is when they splice a video together with movie clips and some clips of the performer in an attempt to create a mini infomercial for the movie.  Luckily, there are none of these on the ""No Jacket Required EP"" (although on other albums, Phil got creative here too).

The first video is for ""Sussudio"".  This was one of the ""fun"" songs on the ""No Jacket Required"" album.  In this video, Phil is in his trademark badly dressed oversized suit and sneakers.  He and his band are trying to play to what is a less than enthusiatic crowd.  This is a video that falls into the ""performance"" related category.  There is nothing special here.  I think the lip syncing isn't that great on this.  We do get some band shots nice shots of Daryl Steurmer, Chester Thompson, and Leland Sklar.  The best way to put this is average.

The next video is ""One More Night"".  They do attempt to bridge this video with ""Sussudio"" by having the club empty after the ""wowing"" of the crowd was done with Sussudio.  The video features Phil at the piano playing the ballad along with his Sax player.  Again, nothing special.

The last three videos are where Phil Collins' gets creative.  Many people probably haven't seen it, but there was a video done for ""Who Said I Would"".  This is one of the better songs on the ""No Jacket Required"" album - especially with the great horn influence on the song.  This song features Phil and band in a performance style video - however, it appears that this is an actual live recording or a remixed recording or a combination of both.  The nice thing is you get to get to hear a different version of the song.  The performance also features the trademark ""wacky dance"" that Phil does during the keyboard interlude - keeping to the ""fun"" element that the ""No Jacket Required"" album brings.  If you are looking for an excellent live version of this song, I'd recommend getting the ""Seriously: Live"" concert.

Conceptual videos are done for the last two songs - and despite my trepidations on this type of video, Phil finds a way to keep your imagination going on this collection.  On ""Don't Lose My Number"", he doesn't attempt to tell a story about the song.  Instead, Phil plays himself - working in an office as his staff brings people in to try to figure out what concept should be done for the video.  Ideas that are ""proposed"" to Phil are things such as the Wild West, Mad Max, the Police ""Every Breath You Take"", David Lee Roth's ""California Girls"", a Japanese Ninja Battle, and The Cars' ""You Might Think"".  My personal favorite part is when they consider making an exercise video out of the song and all of the exercisers come into the office going counting ""1-2-3-4"".  It adds another element to the song that you don't hear on the CD and it makes it so much more enjoyable.  The ""fun"" element"" is alive and well.

The final video is different in that is does attempt to describe the song ""Take Me Home"".  Usually I don't like this type, but I do find this video entertaining.  In this video Phil takes off for an afternoon while his ""wife"" is at home.  Phil drives off to the English countryside - then starts to ""visit"" places as he takes a journey all over the world - London, Paris, Japan, Sweden, New York City, Sydney, Amsterdam, Graceland, Hollywood, San Francisco,  St. Louis, Mt Rainier, and other places.  Much of this was taped during Phil's 1985 World Tour.

There is nothing in the way of liner notes.  The video itself is very weak on credits - so I'm unable to tell whether ""Who Said I Would"" is truly live or not.  I'm also unable to confirm many of the places on ""Take Me Home"". This video compilation is only 29 minutes long with 5 videos.  If the videos for ""Sussudio"" and ""One More Night"" were more interesting, I would easily give this a 5 star rating.  The last 3 videos are really the strength of this collection.  If you can find this collection at a good price, I'd advise trying to pick it up at reasonable price.",1092528000,2,5336,4.462809917355372
