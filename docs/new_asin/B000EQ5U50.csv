I remember being moved to tears by her performance--after her initial two falls, the rest of her program was spot-on gorgeous (especially her famous spiral sequence).  She definitely earned her silver!

Since I've gotten this 2 DVD set, I've watched it nonstop. The pair skating is transcendently beautiful; the partners entwine themselves into breathtaking positions.  The only annoying aspect is Button's interruptive and too often negative commentary.

I really want to see the movie, ""Blades of Glory.""  I've heard it's hilarious!",1178755200,6,661,5.188679245283019
8290323,5,B000EQ5U50,"If you love Figure Skating, definetelly you must have this dvd set. You can watch the Sasha Cohen, Kimmie Meissner, Tanith Belbin & Benjamin Agosto performances. The video & audio are great. But, not High Definition.

Great shopping!!!!!

Go Sasha!!!",1154563200,9,250,5.225

There is the usual irritating nagative commentary from Dick Button, but,like we didn't expect that. The ladies programs include short and long programs for Sasha Cohen,Irina Slutskaya,Kimmie Meissner,Emily Hughes,and Shizuka Arakawa. Men's include:Yevgenei Plushenko,Jeffrey Buttle,Stephan Lambiel,Johnny Weir,and Evan Lysacek. There is also an excellent menu that allows you to get wherever you want to on the dvd. I definately say go for this one!",1152230400,19,548,5.614457831325301
