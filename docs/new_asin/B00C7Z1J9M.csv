8578518,5,B00C7Z1J9M,"This is a fantastically shot, incredibly informative video about so many incredible creatures that live in the reefs of this area. My 7-year-old boys love it and it totally fuels their imaginations (they are budding marine biologists) to no end. When mommy needs a little quiet time, in goes this DVD. Great for the whole family and anyone who loves ocean creatures!",1401408000,,366,4.919354838709677
8578519,5,B00C7Z1J9M,"We ran into a short clip of this show on YouTube--my son is always on the lookout for new and interesting shows about sea life--and we promptly found and watched the full piece.  The video is just beautiful, and the narration is really informative and conveys a real love and understanding of the reef and all of the creatures that live there.  I was surprised to find that it wasn't funded/produced by one of the biggies (NatGeo, Discovery, Animal Planet, BBC).  Really great work.  I hope to see more.",1395705600,,503,4.617977528089888
8578520,5,B00C7Z1J9M,Fantastic video with amazing shots. Very good quality and great comment. A perfect gift to a diver heading for the Andaman and for those who like the magnificent underwater life!,1368057600,3,178,4.966666666666667
8578521,5,B00C7Z1J9M,"This video is beautifully shot and edited and is a fantastic watch.

However, if education is what you are looking for you can turn on the captions to get detailed and scientifically accurate insights into the many and varied species covered.

I rate this a must see video for those planning to dive in the Andaman and a great memory jogger for those lucky enough to dived there already.  And if you are just a fan of underwater videography sit back and enjoy!",1368057600,2,460,4.518072289156627
8578522,5,B00C7Z1J9M,"I've seen this movie 1 time in full, 1 time in half, and a handful of times in sections (10 minutes here, 30 minutes there, etc.).

Quality is outstanding.

I would love to see a 3D version.

This is a true classic.

In my opinion, if you have seen this work of art then it is impossible to rate less than 5 stars.

Nick and his team should win awards for this beautiful ""ocean"" picture <----see what I did there?",1368057600,3,413,4.1125
