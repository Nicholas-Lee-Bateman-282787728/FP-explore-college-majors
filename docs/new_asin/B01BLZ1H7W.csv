8750620,5,B01BLZ1H7W,"Say what you will about the films of Jorg Buttgereit, but even today they resonate as a piece of revolutionary culture. Without context these films can be seen as nothing more than shock horror and smut smashed together, and that would be a fair assessment. It's only by looking at the inner workings of what Buttgereit was doing in the context of German censorship of violence in film at the time that these films turn from exploitative trash to the punk rock cry against the establishment that they truly are. On viewing these later in life they are better than I remember. They are certainly not for the squeamish or easily offended, but I found myself in an odd mixture of revulsion, entertainment, and far too often outright laughter. The director himself admits that the actors were so terrible that talking was kept to a minimum and the score (which is included and fantastic) was mashed over the top to compensate. The question of whether these films are for you is entirely dependent on you as a viewer. For the hardcore gore hound: Yes. For the film buff that realizes the place these films occupy in cinematic history: Yes. If the mere idea of someone rolling an eyeball around in their mouth will scar you for life: maybe skip this one. Four films, a great and informative booklet, and a soundtrack. Great buy in my book.",1494028800,3,1333,4.6525423728813555
