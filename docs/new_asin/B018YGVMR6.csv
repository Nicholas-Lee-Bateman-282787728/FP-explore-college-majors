7559685,5,B018YGVMR6,"I just received this impressive six film collection and overall I'm very pleased with my purchase. Mill Creek has put together a nice package of prison themed films in this 2 DVD set, dating from 1950 -  1973. Mill Creek are typically known for releasing public domain material of varying quality. Good news,  there are absolutely no public domain films in this set. All of the titles here are licensed from Columbia Pictures, there are four black and white and two color features, and the image quality for the most part is fine. No bonus materials or closed captioning is included, this is a bare bones value package. Three things make this set worthwhile, the very low price,  the unique variety,  and the rarity of the movies. A nice mixture of film noir, drama, mobster, and comedy films. Disc one has all four b/w films from the 1950's which previous to this release were expensive and hard to find. Convicted was only available as part of a TCM Glenn Ford Box set, that was specially made on demand, recorded onto DVD-R. The same holds true for Cell 2455, Death Row and Escape From San Quentin which were also mod DVD-R titles. City of Fear is also included as part of TCM's Film Noir Classics Vol. 2 Collection. Disc two has a couple of great films - 1972's The Valachi Papers with Charles Bronson, a gripping mafia movie, and The Last Detail with Jack Nicholson and Randy Quaid, a superior comedy-drama. I previewed all of the movies on both a 55"" TV as well as a 1080p front projector with an 84"" image. The picture on the TV was sharp, on the projector it was somewhat softer but still enjoyable - although some compression issues were clearly visible when watching The Last Detail.  All things considered, I think this set is a great deal and I highly recommend it!",1460419200,23,1777,4.5754716981132075

I wish that all six movies had been 1940's-1950's pot-boilers, and I could think of a few more solid B-pictures to add to the mix to replace the Last Detail and Valachi Papers, but it is what it is.",1516924800,,280,4.090909090909091

8743363,1,B018YGVMR6,This is a sham . The package arrived as in the picture sealed with heat shrink material. When i opened it the  package and it contained two cd's from a TV show The Office.  If zero stars was available i would have rated it that way. This is truely a fraud.,1485993600,2,256,4.0

8743365,5,B018YGVMR6,"Good classics. In my opinion, the best movie out of these 6 films, is The Last Detail (1973) with ''Jack Nicholson'' which he won (Best Actor) in this movie.
Worth it for the price of 6 movies? YES!",1483228800,3,198,4.2368421052631575

8743367,2,B018YGVMR6,"MY FRIEND TOLD ME THAT THIS WAS A GOOD PICTURE. IT WAS BORING AND NICKOLSON WAS NOT THAT GOOD IN THE FLICK, I GIVE IT A 2 STAR BECAUSE OF NOTHING. THE DEATH CELL KILLER AND SUPPOSEDLY ROMEO WAS A BUST. IT DESERVES 1 STAR. THE STAR OF THIS MOVIE SHOULD HAVE STAYED IIN BED THAT DAY. MICKEY ROONY WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER. THE MOST DECENT MOVIE WAS GLENN FORD AND BRODRICK CRAWFORD, BUT MILLARD MITCHELL STOLED THE SHOW WITH HIS, YES, TAUNTING PEOPLE. THIS MOVIE GETS A 3AND A HALF STARS. IT WAS KIND OF SOAP OPERY THOUGH WITH MALONE IN IT.... I'LL WATCH THE REST BECAUSE I HATE TELEVISION...",1477008000,,588,4.306306306306307
