1662869,2,B00005U13N,"This 1979 made for TV film preceded Sellick's great and deserved success in the  long-running TV series Magnum, PI. It recounts the adventures of two ex-cowboys who have left their ranch to see the world.
If you are a fan, you might well enjoy this routine plot as they are mistaken for detectives and agree to search for a missing girl in Nashville. There is as much country music flavor to the film as can be fit in between episodes of their misadventures which may please lovers of country films.
All in all, not a positively painful film to watch for someone trying to fill part of an evening, perhaps more enjoyable for someone with a particular interest in the star or the setting.",1231977600,,687,4.540322580645161

1662875,4,B00005U13N,"CONCRETE COWBOYS is a very funny movie set in 1970's Nashville starring Tom Selleck and Jerry Reed(Country Music Artist and Co-star of Smokey and the Bandit Movies).  Selleck and Reed are a couple of con-artist cowboys from Montana who end up in Nashville in the adventure of their lives.
The movie starts with Selleck and Reed playing a game of poker at a truck stop, where Reed gets them beat up and chased out of town.  They hop a freight-train where they wind up in Nashville, Tennessee.  Coincidentally, Reed has a friend that lives in Nashville that he calls to find a place to stay.  The guy that Reed calls happens to be going out of town and lets them stay at his apartment and drive his corvette, which is very convenient for these two traveling hobos.  Selleck and Reed come to find out that this guy is a private detective and they take a case to find a missing girl.  Along the way they meet several country music stars such as Roy Acuff and Ray Stevens.  I won't give away the suprise ending or any of the twists that befall these two lovable losers, but you won't be dissapointed.
Tom Selleck and Jerry Reed are great as cowboy buddies taking a murder case while posing as private detectives.  Jerry Reed is the conniving slick one of the pair while Tom Selleck is the somewhat dumb one, but he does carry a set of encyclopedias with him throughout the entire movie so he can ""get himself some learnin"".
This is a great movie for anyone that likes country music, since it is full of songs by Jerry Reed, live performances by Ray Stevens, and other country songs of the late 70's.  Also, this movie is a great look at all the Nashville landmarks like the Opryland Hotel, Parthenon, and Country Music Hall of Fame.  I first saw this movie at about 1:00 in the morning on TBS a few years ago, and having lived in the Nashville area all my life it was funny to see the city 25 years ago.  Plus it is only $5.00 so what's really stopping you from buying it...trust me you'll like it even if its just for the cheesiness.",1081900800,39,2029,4.384

1662908,2,B00005U13N,"Concrete Cowboys (1979) partners singer/actor Jerry Reed, and Tom Selleck, in what was the pilot for a TV series.  The pair play a couple of good old boy types who unexpectedly get involved the investigation of a missing persons case.  This lightweight detective/comedy mostly works because of the easy going chemistry between Reed and Selleck, both rather likeable guys.  Reed would later star in the short lived Concrete Cowboys series, but without Selleck, who was set to star in his own series, Magnum P.I.

On the run from the law in Montana, J.D. Reed (Reed) and Will Eubanks (Selleck) hop a freight train, and get off in Nashville.  Through some good fortune, the guys find a place to stay, and are almost immediately recruited by a woman named Kate (Morgan Fairchild), to find her missing sister Cara, an aspiring singer.

Set in the recording capitol of country music, the movie features appearances by singers Barbara Mandrel, Roy Acuff, and Ray Stevens, as well as Claude Akins as a rich songwriting mogul who may have something to do with Cara's disappearance.

If you can recall the trucker/country/Southern fad of the late 70's, you might appreciate the nostalgia factor of this rather modest and mildly amusing made for TV production.  Jerry Reed (1937-2008), often the second banana in films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gator/dp/B000092Q5H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gator</a>&nbsp;(1976), and the Smokey and the Bandit series, gets a chance to assume a more prominent role, and makes a good match with the laid back Selleck.  And Reed also provides a few songs for the film's soundtrack.",1346544000,,1656,5.387596899224806
1662909,3,B00005U13N,"""Concrete Cowboys"" is a late 1970s murder mystery-comedy-buddy film starring Jerry Reed and Tom Selleck as two good-natured drifters having adventures of various sorts. The film begat a very short-lived spinoff TV series starring Reed, but Selleck is the clear star presence here. The film begins with some ill-advised fisticuffs, and results in the two buddies hopping a freight train to Nashville where they encounter many country music stars of the era in a variety of cameos. I was most amused by the way Ray Stevens' live act was incorporated into the film (much to Reed's extremely exaggerated amusement, particularly when Ray mentions ""Fruit of the Looms,"") while Barbara Mandrell and Roy Acuff get bit parts as well. Rounding out the primary cast is Morgan Fairchild in a dual role that must be seen to be believed (if you don't see this one coming you aren't paying attention,) and everyone's favorite heavy, Claude Akins as Woody Stone, the biggest star in Nashville.

The plot is extremely farfetched and involves a case of mistaken identity, a private investigator with ulterior motives (that aren't supposed to be obvious,) a femme fatale and unrequited love subplot, and Jerry Reed in a hot tub. (To be fair, Tom Selleck is there too.) If you look closely you can see many significant Nashville locations, which are kind of fun to spot. The film has an unfocused feel at some points as it tries to walk a line between a serious life-and-death drama and a lighthearted buddy film. The dialogue underscores this dichotomy, with Reed getting most of the prize lines (""My stomach feels like a gas factory!"") Even the villains get amusing names, e.g. a gangster named Mr. Hatcheck (Joseph Burke) who is the evil casino owner, and whose role in the plot does little but pad the running time.

The plot is easily deduced in the first third of the film, and actually plays more like a television show than a feature film. I won't divulge the wild plot ""twists,"" the convoluted ending, or the theft, blackmail, and murder that make the film function on a basic level, but I will mention a couple of specific annoyances. First, the film is divided by incredibly amateurish title cards to section up the movie and let you reappraise where you are in the plot at any given time (""Chapter Six: 'Surprise at the Bone Orchard,'"" which obviously foreshadows a chase in a cemetery, for instance). Another is the use of flashbacks: they don't further the story, the tension, or the suspense in any way, but they do muddy the storytelling significantly.

The film is not unenjoyable, but understand that it is not the best work of anyone involved. Selleck and Akins come off as the best actors overall, though nobody is terrible in their roles. If you want to see Tom Selleck or Jerry Reed (who gets to sing) in their late-1970s form, this is a good bet. Likewise fans of country music will probably like seeing some of the big names onscreen, though I felt sorry for poor Roy Acuff who looks positively ill at ease in his role. The plot is neither complex nor difficult to figure out, but for a Nashville-themed comedic whodunit, this is a choice that fans will likely appreciate.",1340236800,,3176,4.781420765027322

The packaging looked as if it was nothing more than Saranwrap with the ends heated.

Two stars for the plot and acting would be very generous.  Jerry Reed could never be considered an actors actor but he is generally entertaining.  Not so much in this one.

1662937,5,B00005U13N,"Made in 1979, this lively TV-movie spun off a brief (seven-episode) TV series that was probably instrumental in getting Tom Selleck his defining role as Thomas Magnum.  It also has a definite&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Simon-Simon-Season-One/dp/B000GW8UAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Simon & Simon - Season One</a>-esque feel to it, being as it is the story of two unlikely and completely opposite partners and the more-than-it-seems adventure they find themselves falling into.  J. D. Reed (played by country singer Jerry Reed, who does unexpectedly well in the role simply by being himself) and Will Eubanks (Selleck) are out of a ranch in Montana and on their way to Hollywood when J. D. loses their stake in a crooked poker game and forces them to hop the first freight they find--which turns out to be bound for ""the place [J. D. wants] his ashes scattered,"" Music City, USA--Nashville, TN.  Contacting local PI Lonnie Grimes (Randolph Powell), whom they met some time earlier while he was on vacation, they are offered his apartment and car while he's out of town, on condition that they pick up ""a package"" for him and keep it safe till he can claim it.  Then a client (Morgan Fairchild) mistakes them for him and asks them to help her find her missing sister, a wannabe country star who's been reported dead but whose grave seems to be nonexistent.  Operating on instinct and guessery, the pair soon realize there's more going on than meets the eye, as they deal with a hostile plainclothesman (veteran Gene Evans), a floating crap game run by a very nasty fellow named Hatcheck (Joseph Burke), a hired killer, and a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rashomon-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00003CXC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rashomon - Criterion Collection</a>-like confusion of different versions of who Carla was and what she did.

Selleck's performance (he's the A. J. Simon of this team, cautious and unwilling to pretend he and his partner are something they're not, and intriguingly resolved to ""read all the books in the 'Cyclopedia""--when J. D. laments that he'll ""be eighty, bald and toothless time you get done,"" he replies that ""there won't be a smarter eighty-bald-and-toothless old goat in America!"") is the high point of the movie; you can see how some of Will's character found its way into Thomas Magnum.  (And his reading at least once saves them from a term in jail--""It's all there in the C's, civil, common, and criminal law,"" he says smugly.)  Daring, down-home J. D. balances him with impulse and a combination of enthusiasm, castles-in-the-air plans for the future, and laid-back relaxation.  Several country stars--Roy Acuff, Ray Stevens, and Barbara Mandrell--appear as themselves to add versimilitude to the story.  With plenty of wild action and a sympathetic hero-duo (viewers who enjoyed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cowboy-Way/dp/0783229631/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cowboy Way</a>&nbsp;are likely to find it particularly to their taste), it's a little-known but very enjoyable action-comedy.",1256515200,2,3170,5.783261802575107
