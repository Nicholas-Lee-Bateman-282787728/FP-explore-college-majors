The premise for this film is that there is a scroll that tells one how to achieve immortality of the gods. There is a particular sorceress after this scroll. She begins to work her way through this particular family that has knowledge of this scroll by marrying the father, and killing him during sex to take his essense...she's very similar to a vampire in this regard. She then works her way down through the family until she is left with the youngest daughter who is the 'pure' one. By this point our villianess is sporting both sets of genetalia, and must outlast our heroine to achieve her immortality and be all powerful...as to the outcome, I'll leave that to you to see the movie.
 This film had sprinklings of humor, but on a whole was a very very dark film. Whereas in Sex and Zen the comedy was the strength of the film. In some regards I guess it could be considered a comedy, but I felt it was a bit too dark to fall within the comedy genre. If you're a fan of Chinese Erotic films, you might enjoy this. However, if you expect something akin to Sex & Zen, you're in for a major disappointment.",996278400,3,1243,4.334763948497854

7904025,3,B000006C1K,I really liked this movie more than the first one. There are some elements of Chinese Mythology and some moments so absurd that are funny.  The best thing is Qi Shu in one of her first acting jobs. She is really beautiful and has far better acting skills than the main character.,1417737600,,279,4.365384615384615
7904026,5,B000006C1K,"I had to counter the person who gave this only 1 star. It's been many years since I've seen this movie but it is and will always be a classic. I think whoever wrote that review just doesn't appreciate this genre---which I would describe as humorous semi-mainstream Asian fantasy porn. This movie, of course, is one of the movies that launched the career of Shu Qi, who went on to become a popular mainstream actress (in the US she's best known as the girl in The Transporter), so it will always have a place in movie history for that reason. And it really is pretty funny. I love the idea of the virginity armor. I really would recommend this movie to just about anyone---not just people who are interested in quirky Asian porn. I really think that just about anyone would be able to find some aspect of this movie that they love. Your straight white grandmother would probably think it was hilarious. I bet even the reviewer who gave it 1 star would eventually fall in love with it if he (or she?) watched it enough times. I feel like anyone who goes through their life without seeing this is definitely missing out on a very interesting and memorable experience.",1415404800,5,1164,4.521327014218009
7904027,1,B000006C1K,The quality of this Blue Ray is marginal at best- Very disappointing. The movie itself was horrible which added insult to injury!,1356220800,,129,4.909090909090909
7904028,3,B000006C1K,"One reviewer rated the movie because of his infatuation with Shu-Qi solely, the other because of her infatuation with Shu-Qi (and thought the movie stupid). This I understand, as she is a gorgeous creature to behold, but if either reviewer bothered to research the film prior to purchasing, none of this would have been a shock. It`s a very silly sex comedy, as are most, but the campy humor, comical characters and over-the-top extravaganza on display makes for more fun than either reviewer indicated. Yes, it`s ridiculous, but it`s also funny (funnier than any Leslie Neilsen comedy I`ve suffered through) and occasionally stupid, but there aren`t a lot of flix like this around, whether that`s a good thing or not is up to each viewer. One scene is almost riveting, the next semi-moronic, but as a sex satire with demons, dementia, loads of nudity and innuendo, and a few artistic moments, it has its pros as well as cons. An all around oddity, just like the pairing of Sex and Zen...",1271721600,11,988,4.783625730994152
7904029,1,B000006C1K,"I bought this movie because it has the lovely Shu Qi in it.  The dialogue and dubbing was the worse and stupidest I have ever heard, the acting was horrible and the plot was non existant.  This movie was so bad about 15 minutes was all I could stand before I started fast forwarding looking for something worth watching.  Luckily the one good sex scene with Shu Qi can be accessed by itself otherwise there is nothing on this disk to make it worth buying.",1267315200,8,455,4.329411764705882
7904030,3,B000006C1K,"Let's face it...no one is going to buy this DVD expecting a great story or intricate plot. You want to see Shu Qi naked, period. And yes, she does appear in her birthday suit a few times (and she is gorgeous). However, she doesn't make an appearance until about 30 min into the movie. The extended sex scenes, touted by the DVD title, are only a measly few seconds longer than the actual scenes within the movie. The quality of the DVD is alright but not great. I'd recommend this title only for die-hard Shu Qi fans. Personally, I prefer other Shu Qi DVDs like ""Shu Qi: Dreaming Naked Show"" and ""True Woman"" which are truly exceptional (you get to see a ""lot"" more of Shu Qi without the distraction of a cheesy movie)",1252713600,36,718,4.365671641791045
7904031,3,B000006C1K,"This is one of the early adult movie that Shu Qi did and one of the more erotic ones. Like most Cat III movies, the story is silly. Kin (played by Elvis Tsui) is worried that his daughter, Yau, (played by Loletta Lee) will be taken advantage of by other men and forces her to wear a 'Chastity Armor'.

Kin in the meantime has numerous wives, affairs and even seduces his own mentally challenged son's wife, Siu Siu (played by Shu Qi). Unknown to him, Shu Qi is an evil spirit in disguise.

The movie climaxes in the murder of all of Kin's household. In the end, Yau, aided by a handsome swordsman she has fallen for and her fellow student with a mechanical manhood -attempt to seek revenge and save the world from sexual domination. I told you the story was silly.",1125100800,,764,4.335664335664336
