4486152,5,B004WCSMGQ,"This drama kept unfolding at each new corner. I couldn't believe it. Henry, played by the man Zach Braff, handles different typed of pressure at each different corner. From sharing his consequence with a 16 year old teen, to comforting Nathalie AND his own conscience at the same time, this movie portrays what one man, out of a million, would do. This has courage written all over it. Zach Braff is a genius of an actor, and Deborah Chow is a genius of a director.",1303344000,5,465,4.482352941176471

The husband did far more damage by not being there for her, it seemed. The universe brought them together with an unimaginable tragedy. The movie will take you through many emotions, one of love and hate. The title should be called ""the high cost of loving"" -- but get it. The intensity of his and her emotions were so real.

4486181,3,B004WCSMGQ,"The high cost of living is an interesting look at consequences. The acting is solid nada the cultural barriers perceived well. Some of the characters and their backgrounds are shallow but the story is pretty centralized around the two main ones. Their developing relationship and subsequent conflicts. It is in equal parts sad and cute, depressing and heart warming.

Zach Braff is really on point and the rest of the cast is strong if less capable of filling their characters. I enjoyed the movie thoroughly and while it was by no means perfect would recommend it to anyone willing to take a moment to think. This is not really a movie for a laugh, or the light minded viewer its provoking and deep through and through",1416182400,,719,4.7063492063492065

4486189,5,B004WCSMGQ,"Going to be honest - I'm not a huge fan of Zach Braff. I don't know why, maybe it's because I just couldn't imagine him outside of the Scrubs character role. However, I thought he did a great job in this one.

This one is a great movie though. It deals with heavy drama, but you don't feel overwhelmed at any point during it. I wished it had a slightly better ending, but I'm sure others will appreciate the way it does conclude.

Would I watch it again? Probably not. But the first time was worth it.",1415318400,,501,4.154639175257732
4486190,3,B004WCSMGQ,"I watched The High Cost of Living. 2010.
Zach Braff is this cute guy with big lips.
The movie was gimmicky. The pregnant woman carries around a stillborn for too long.
There is no chemistry. Spoiler alert: It's not Zach's baby and there is no chemistry.
That is my summation. Don't do it. You will regret it. Zach Braff tries to trick the audience into thinking people can atone for their mistakes. Nice try Zach, I'm not biting.",1413763200,,429,4.512820512820513

The ending is more true to life than most, because there isn't always a neat bow to tie on so we can call something ""done"", but is still unsatisfying with the unknown, as a viewer. There are also other rabbit trails in the initial story line that we don't see more of. Overall, though, still not a waste of time.",1408147200,,365,4.154929577464789

Another reviewer didn't understand why he couldn't go ahead with his confession after she told him of her plans to schedule surgery.  That was because she finally had the strength to move forward (and she was running out of time).  He couldn't throw another shock at her at that time.  Plus, he knew she would benefit from his support.  He thought of her first, and confessing at that time would not have been the best for her.

4486226,3,B004WCSMGQ,"I can't believe that out of all these vague but glowing 5 star reviews, NO one has a problem with the premise that this devastated pregnant woman, who lost her child in such a callous and violent way,  is advised by her doctors to go ahead and walk around for a few weeks still carrying her dead baby ?  Is it just me, or is this scenario just utterly ridiculous and unbelievable? Nurses go out of their way to protect women who have lost a baby from any further anguish (such happy new moms holding their healthy newborns and celebratory visitors).

Oddly enough, I still found the movie worth watching.  I thought the acting was good and other parts of the plot interesting. For instance, as Henry begins to realize just how many lives he has damaged and dragged into the devastation. It seems plausible that he would want to turn his life around, after causing the death of a child.  All these things ring true, but against the backdrop of the poor woman carrying her dead baby for weeks... Just made me spend the entire movie thinking ""you've got to be kidding?

4486230,2,B004WCSMGQ,"Improbable things appear in movie scripts that do not happen in real life, and do not happen in novels where characters are allowed to act as who they are, as who the author has made them.

He stays up all night anguished and in the morning is finally ready to tell her the most important thing, the thing that the film is about, the big thing, the difficult thing, maybe the irreconcilable thing. But, as can only happen in the movies, he does not tell. Why? Not reasonable that he could be so easily deflected.

Both actors did a very good job of portraying the complex mixture of emotions that their characters must have been experiencing in the complicated sitautions.  Was surprised by Zach Braff's performance.  He has more complexity here, and does a good job of it, than in other work I've seen of his.

The film was a bit of a downer since the tone of the story was one of sadness and loss, not my normal kind of flim choice.  Yet intertwined in the sad story, was also a layer of redemption and self sacrifice.

In spite of this story line not being my my usual choice, both actors were able to capture my attention and keep me interested through the whole film.",1396051200,,699,4.464566929133858

4486233,4,B004WCSMGQ,"Sometimes quiet is good. Not every film needs to slap you around or wow you. This is one of those films.

Here's the scoop. Henry Welles (Zach Braff) is a locksmith/ drug dealer. One night, while driving, he hits pregnant Nathalie (Isabelle Blais) sending her to the hospital. He takes off but is concerned for her to the point he tracks her down and befriends her to make certain she's okay. A relationship develops that is doomed by its very basis. How will this play out.

A drug dealing Zach Braff!? Yes. Sort of. He deals prescription drugs. No H, or weed or meth. And he cares about his customers. He's not trolling the dregs of society. He lives a casual life there in the French part of Canada. Works when he needs to and deals to make up the difference, so this isn't too far from the Zach we've seen in other outings. This leisurely paced effort takes it's time to work the characters and situation. Yes he tracks her down out of guilt but she's a genuinely good person, as is he, so his caring naturally leads to a growing relationship. He needs something in her and she needs something in him.

This is writer/director Deborah Chow's first feature length film and she does a nice job of things. It's lensed well, cut well and has a decent sound track. I like the use of the neighborhood. It draws the viewer in because you feel you're there with these folk. And you have to wonder how this will play out and I was very satisfied with the decisions Chow made. This could be said to be more of a woman's movie but Zach's character is written well so I considered it very even handed in that regard. It IS more leisurely paced which might be off-putting to some. But if you're willing to spend the time and patience the pay-off is well worth it",1386633600,,1753,4.371165644171779

That is a rare gift.  I look forward to seeing his future work, he has genuine talent.",1363824000,6,323,4.0
4486247,4,B004WCSMGQ,An excellent movie that looks at the value of life.  A welcome refreshment versus the shoot em up violence depicted today in too many films.,1363737600,,140,4.6

4486249,5,B004WCSMGQ,Sad storyline mixed with tender human emotions and surprising developments (like love!). I was really moved by this film and would encourage anyone to see it.,1362614400,,158,5.115384615384615
4486250,4,B004WCSMGQ,"No matter how we love or hate and our first or second intentions, there are limits and should be: that seems to be the moral of this story.  Very interesting portrait of characters.  Worth watching.  Bit of a surprise ending to enjoy.",1362355200,,234,4.523809523809524
4486251,3,B004WCSMGQ,"This is an unusual story with average acting. I enjoyed the movie but wouldn't say it's a ""have to watch"" movie.",1361491200,,112,4.380952380952381
4486252,5,B004WCSMGQ,"This movie makes you think about what kind of a person you are, it have some emotional moments in it where it defines what time of person you are.

4486254,5,B004WCSMGQ,Overall it was a very great film. It did seem a little slow at times but I feel that maybe it was necessary to complete the somber mood of the film as a whole. Worth watching for sure.,1356825600,,184,3.8684210526315788
4486255,5,B004WCSMGQ,"Realistic and definitely believable, ""High Cost"" delivers all the emotions that make us human.  Most of all, what appears on the surface of this touching drama is nothing like the inside of it.  Though the scenes lends itself to quiet and stoic instances and simple takes of conversation, the movie itself is never boring.  Like mixing chemicals that cause a chain reaction, the chemistry here creates an instant viewer bonding.  I'm still trying to figure out how such a seemingly slow moving movie can garner such attention to my senses.  But there I was, totally captivated from the beginning to end.  And really, I didn't want the movie to end.  However, had the movie gone on and had a happy ending, then and only then would the film be susceptible to being called not believable. Gladly, the film ends abruptly but just at the right time, all for the viewer to imagine an ending that could be happy, sad, or somewhere in between.

Props to the actors for making such a wonderful film.",1347062400,6,990,4.682080924855492

4486257,2,B004WCSMGQ,"I can accept one main character who is at rock bottom, but both is almost too much.  Neither knows the other and have to go through the long awkward phases of connecting and revealing themselves.  There are some stories in life that deserve the dignity and sensitivity of not being told.  A woman with a dead baby inside her belly for me is near the top of that list.",1343347200,4,367,4.2898550724637685
4486258,5,B004WCSMGQ,"I first saw this film at the Cleveland International Film Festival and couldn't stop thinking about it.  This film pulled me in from the start with it's original story and great acting.  I think you will agree that Zach Braff is becoming an amazing actor and quite diverse; this film shows him in a different role from anything we've seen him in before and he makes it his own.  Best of all, you don't know how this story will end - that's why I love indie films and think this one is a gem.",1342224000,,491,4.202127659574468
4486259,4,B004WCSMGQ,This movie is Canadian..It has many scenes in the beginning in French with English Subtitles...I hate reading when I want to be watching!!! But most of the movie is in English. Weird story. Movie ended & I felt it was unfinished..I guess thats what is known as a B movie & why it didn't make it to the theatres. I like Zack Braff thats why I bought it.,1327536000,,352,4.1911764705882355

4486261,5,B004WCSMGQ,Though this movie has a very sad tone to how people meet. I think Zach Braff does an excellent job in playing the character as the character discovers himself and his faults. I plan on purchasing this movie when it is available.,1311465600,,228,4.4523809523809526
4486262,5,B004WCSMGQ,"This suprised me. I didn't think I could think of Zach Braff as anyone other than Bambi (JD from Scrubs) but he pulled it off in this movie. This is a very sad and touching movie. A really well done movie all around.

*I would suggest it may not be for someone who is pregnant because it is kind of disturbing.",1306368000,7,310,4.081967213114754
4486263,5,B004WCSMGQ,"I have had a hard time, in other Zack Braff movies,seeing past the part he played for 7 years (I consider the 8th season of Scrubs a bust and hard to watch). I can now say Mr. Braff has finally moved past the role of John Dorian and I see him as a straight actor. Bravo for that. He has proven he can climb out of the pigeon hole of prime time comedy.

I found the rest of the cast to be brilliant. Isabelle Blais was amazing and shined in her part of Nathalie.

The writing was wonderful and a nice change from the cliche` drivel offered by the movie industry over the past 10 years. Ms. Chow you have opened my eyes to new possibilities. I only hope this is the beginning of more great objective films to come.

Thank you for truly entertaining me.

4486264,5,B004WCSMGQ,A great independent film with characters who draw you into the story. Zach Braff does an excellent job of creating a character who's desire for redemption is almost palpable even if he doesn't believe himself that he's deserving of it. Well acted and a good looking film overall. I highly recommend it to any fan of Indy films.,1304121600,6,327,4.655172413793103
4486265,5,B004WCSMGQ,"Awesome movie about life, loss, love and personal character. It shows that there can be change in a person's life who has made poor choices. Zach Braff is definitely not JD in this flick!",1303776000,,187,4.529411764705882
4486266,5,B004WCSMGQ,"Very Good Movie
The Best Drama I've ever Seen
Zach Braff is Excellent and should get a lot of nominations for this role
Isabelle Blais shows emotion very well.

Zach Braff does a great job distancing himself from J.D. (Scrubs). Characters were nicely done-although there are gaps in the script (how long would your husband go without a call from you??). Predictable ending and love twist. It was good to see Henry (Zach Braff) not take advantage of the woman.",1303430400,3,317,5.0

8444889,4,B004WCSMGQ,"This movie was hauntingly sad.  It depicts how difficult it is to ""let go"" of personal tragedy even when the world expects you to move on.  The movie was almost too real in its honesty as I found myself longing for some kind of miracle to make everything okay again.  No miracles were given, of course, so we have to view the world as it really is - messy and unpredictable.  Zach Braff was so good in this role that I completely forgot about Scrubs.  His was a tortured soul.  Isabelle Blais was amazing.  I was drawn into her pain; her sadness.  I had not heard of this movie but I really enjoyed it and am recommending it to friends and family.",1426636800,,647,4.245901639344262
