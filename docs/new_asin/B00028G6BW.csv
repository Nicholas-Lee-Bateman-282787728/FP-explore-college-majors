2068000,5,B00028G6BW,"The Angelina Ballerina series of books come alive in the animated series. This particular DVD contains the episodes ""William the Conjuror,"" ""Angelina and Grandma,"" ""Miss Lilly comes to Dinner"" and ""Angelina's Valentine."" The episodes themselves run to about 12 mins each, interspersed with actual takes of dance lessons, either ballet, folk etc.

The animation is clear and remains faithful to Helen Craig's original illustrations and the stories are faithful to Katharina Holabird's original material. The series will appeal to aspiring young dancers and is recommended for preschoolers and up.",1240790400,,595,5.685393258426966
