8038973,5,B00065GX7S,In my opinion this dvd is great for babies 1 year and under its very babyish and doesn't have much action or adventure going on but this particular DVD is more in the simple side. Overall good product Im a big fan!,1423785600,,214,4.119047619047619
8038974,5,B00065GX7S,"I got this for my daughter last year and she liked it a lot.  The music is fun and she enjoyed tapping her feet slow and fast to the first song.  We recently moved and haven't watched it in awhile, I found it the other day and she was so excited to see it again.  :)",1320105600,,266,3.7142857142857144
8038975,5,B00065GX7S,My daughter LOVED this video. the thunder clouds caught her interest right away. I would recommend this to parents with infants.,1272844800,,128,5.142857142857143
8038976,5,B00065GX7S,i was very impressed with this video.  we were told by most of our friends to try juno but we had never heard of it.  i had only heard of baby einstein or baby mozart which we didn't think was very interesting.  this one is much cuter.  the music is truly beautiful and the puppets make my son laugh out loud.  he then wants me to talk like one of them.  they also teach a bit about shapes and numbers.  the thing i like about this video is that it gives children a lot more credit than most of the junk that's out there.  my son really seems to appreciate the music which we'd love to find on cd somewhere.,1110499200,4,607,4.0
8038977,5,B00065GX7S,"Juno Baby really has quite wonderful music.  The music is finally real music played by real orchestras (or at least as far as I can tell!) and is quite diverse.  The video moves very slowly from scene to scene between new cute and chubby little characters.  There's very little dialog, but my daughter gets a little thrill when she hears the voices.  I assume it's intentionally slow and easy to understand for infants.  Also, the music selections blend very nicely to what you see on the screen.  They also include some simple introductions to concepts like numbers and shapes.  But for the most part, the reason to be interested in this video is for the cute characters and the beautiful music.  They have a theme song which recurs a couple of times throughout the video that nobody in our house can get out of their head.  It's very nicely done.  Unfortunately, they only seem to have the one video  at the moment.",1110153600,5,917,4.598765432098766
8038978,5,B00065GX7S,"I bought this DVD after reading a story about it and was extremely happy with it.  I have a 19 month old son who recently had an ear infection.  He was really cranky and the only thing that made him happy was this video.  He now walks around the house holding the video box and asking us to sing the theme song to him.  Our entire family was forced to learn the lyrics!  They also include a nice interactive guide with some pretty nice ideas.  Above all though, the music is truly beautiful.  My son gets so excited when he sees the puppets and his favorite seems to be Buzz the bee!",1109808000,5,583,4.151785714285714
