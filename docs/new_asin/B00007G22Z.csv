8323849,5,B00007G22Z,"This is the first program in the Documents of Destiny series. This and the other two in the box set were produced in succession with The Colonization of North America so the production was a real bear but it was also a lot of fun. In fifteen days we were on thirteen flights, in five rental cars, two taxis, two shuttle buses and eight or ten motel rooms and went through thirteen states. I would love to travel if I could take my bed with me! We went from one hundred degrees in Florida to forty degrees in Michigan. When we stayed in Philadelphia before our flight out at 5:00AM so for dinner I found Tommy's Sub Shop. I can't remember what street it was on but I can't forget what I had. It was the Super Sub for 10.95. It was three feet long and as wide as a softball if not wider. I could only eat half of it. I could have taken it on the flight with me but we had no refrigeration for it and I would have looked stupid carrying around a greasy dripping bag so I fed it to some stray cats at the motel (The sandwich, not the bag). Those poor things ate the lettuce and everything. You can't blame them, Pennsylvania really has the best food I've ever had.

8323850,5,B00007G22Z,"Documents of Destiny Creating a New Nation. I haven't typed those words in over a year! It's a very good feeling to look back at how I felt when we delivered this program. I kept thinking, 'These shows are so good, we're going to wind up doing ten more!' Well, we did eight more anyway. This is part three in the origional three pack developement. The three pack made sense because it follows the protection of individual rights in the Magna Carta through all the various Compacts, Treatises, Acts, Declarations, Constitutions, Statutes, Articles, and Papers and then...Washington eloquently resigns and they cry! His fellow Americans were crying because he was going home to his wife. His military and political life was over. He went to sit on the porch in the hot Virginia sun, drink tea, and watch the crops grow. To Americans it reminded them that an entire generation of a new land had come and gone and it was like being left on your own. I never knew that before I edited this program. Most people might say, ""George Washington, didn't he die in office?"" I wouldn't have said that but the part about people crying, I had no idea.
While I love this series, I must pick my favorites. Those are Documents of Destiny Compromise and Conflict and Documents of Destiny The Civil War and Reconstruction. Those two programs focus on the events leading up to the Civil War and the consequences of the war. To think of this nation being torn apart by the very foundations it was created upon is difficult. These two programs provide that understanding and make something that happened one hundred and fifty years ago seem very recent.
Sincerely,
