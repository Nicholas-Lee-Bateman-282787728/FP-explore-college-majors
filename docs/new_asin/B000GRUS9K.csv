You know how you feel about the characters as their lives play out in front of you, but it's sorta difficult to draw conclusions about the sum of the parts when the closing credits role. Despite watching unfulfilled lives and drawn-out affliction for most of its duration, Atomised ends on a surprisingly upbeat note (which normally I consider a cop out, but here found to be a relief). As in real life, beauty can be borne of tragedy.

The contrast between how the two half-brothers (who grow up separately) are affected by the sporadic, very occasional appearances of their mother is notable, but their divergent paths more begs the question of whether it was the genes of their respective fathers that account for their disparate lives, or the environments they were raised in. Christian Ulmen portrays the brother Michael, who was raised by his grandmother and seems only interested in science (at the expense of all else); this has gotten him far in life professionally, but it seems a lonely existence. Moritz Bleibtreu portrays the sharply contrasting Bruno, the brother who had an unpleasant upbringing followed by an unhappy marriage; he is a failed writer and is struggling with his relentless pursuit of sexual gratification, which leads to his sexually harassing one of his high school students in an empty classroom. This was the last straw: he then checks himself into a mental institution.

The fine acting is the glue that holds this hot mess together. I purchased this DVD from Europe due to following the career of Nina Hoss, an established German actor who here plays Jane, the hippie mother. Other outstanding actors include Franka Potente, who adds the much needed element of ""true love,"" and Martina Gedeck (119 acting credits), who is perhaps the soulmate of Bruno. You are likely to have seen the lovely Franka Potente in something; she was Marie in The Bourne Trilogy, Lola in Lola rennt (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Run-Lola-Run/dp/B00C6BZOSO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Run Lola Run</a>), Anne Frank in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Horror-Story-Season-2/dp/B009SJ3H8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Horror Story Season 2</a>, and now science fiction fans can get excited about her appearance this year in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Matter-Season-2/dp/B01I47BM8E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Matter Season 2</a>&nbsp;as Chief Inspector Shaddick.

As mentioned by other reviewers, Atomised is not the type of film to appear at the multiplex. The character Bruno is not likable for most of the movie, but his complexity is what will keep some audiences engaged (if not sometimes repulsed by his deviant sexual habits). As well as the tragedy revolving around him, he is also the source of the film's only humor; after leaving the mental institution, Bruno goes to a hippie gathering despite passionately hating hippies (he attends solely with hopes of experiencing ""free love""). If this all sounds like the makings of something worth watching, then I'm done here.",1468022400,,3225,5.728601252609604
8134219,4,B000GRUS9K,"This is a story about a two brothers, actually half brothers who had a hippie mother who didn't cared much about them and they suffered from not being loved. They both have problems when they grew up.
Michael, a molecular biologist, is more interested in genes than women, while Bruno is obsessed with his sexual desires, but mostly finds his satisfaction with prostitutes. His pitiful life changes when he gets to know the experienced Christiane.
In the meantime, Michael meets Annabelle, the love of his youth.
Michael is a genious biologist while Bruni teaches in college.
Michael is kind of steady while Bruni has a mental problem. He just got divorced
When Cristiane dies, Bruno begins to imagine that she is still alive and she is always with him which is pretty sad.
There are a lot of sexual shots and I was surprised that the UK version of the DVD was described as Rated 15. It says children under 15 cannot see without their parents. I think the rating system is quite different there.
Bruno and his girlfriend did a lot of exotic sexual things together both in public places with other people and at their houses before she died. That's where we see a lot of nudity.

This movie is kind of dark and it's not for everyone.
It is not a happy ending also and leaves the audience with blank minded what to think after the show is over. What is the director truely wanted to say?
It is obvious that both brothers didn't lived all happy life because of their mother's selfish hippie free love affair that involves not taking care of them both.
But one thing for sure is looking at both brothers make you love the both charactors very much. They acted very well.
Also the Franka Potente was great to see again. She was in the famous movie <RUN LOLA RUN(Lola rennt (1998) )>.",1460764800,,1778,4.538940809968848
8134220,5,B000GRUS9K,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this, but I doubted that there would be much happiness from uncomplicated love.  OK, I like a good, realistic drama that is full of anguish, dashed hopes, and disillusionment, but there also has to be some growth, some meaning behind the tragedy - fortunately, that is at the center of this pessimistic, brutally cynical film.

The story is about 2 brothers and their separate lives.  One of them (Bruno) appears normal, married with a child and working as a teacher while pursuing his writing.  The other (Michael) appears the oddball, an intellectual who is haunted by memories and lives more or less like a monk in the temple of science.  However, appearances deceive:  the normal one is boiling with rage, lust, and a terrible isolation to the point that he screams at his mother on the death bed.  The scientist has rich memories of an apparently unrequited childhood love, which he remembers with a nostalgia that yearns for a deeper commitment.  In fact, both of them are profoundly alienated, so far unable to form healthy relationships and move on.

Their common issue is a narcissistic hippy mother, who gave them over to their respective grandmothers and didn't even tell one about the other until they were adolescents.  As a boy, Bruno was taken to her commune, where she lived like a libertine with indiscriminate lovers and neglecting her duties as a mother.  When Bruno meets Michael, it is extremely awkward, but they somehow form a bond that will be important for both of them.  The mother then goes off with her latest lover, leaving them forever.

As adults, Michael is pursuing a vision that would revolutionize genetics, oddly to make sexless reproduction possible.  He quits his business job to return to his mathematical research in another firm, but first he visits the house of his childhood love.  Of course, an unlikely romance follows that, while tragic, is extremely beautiful and moving.  The girl, it turns out, has reached her own impasse in life and opens herself to Michael with a wonderful ease.  Meanwhile, Bruno's life disintegrates into a nervous breakdown; he loses everything - family and job - and desperately seeks a new relationship in a kind of hippy sex camp, where he meets a fellow libertine and they embark on an experimental relationship that involves going to sex clubs and plans to live together.  This too ends in tragedy and an awful failure.  Both of the women are extraordinary in their own ways and ultimately uplifting.  I do not want to reveal spoilers, but the destinies of the brothers diverge horribly.

In the background, there is a serious philosophical look at modern society.  The auteur despises capitalist materialism, which he seems to portray as responsible for the loss of values.  His characters prefers things to meaning.  That being said, this is by no means marxist.  The auteur also despises hippies, who he sees as hedonists more interested in sex than love and as parasites on the modern economy.  It is very bitter, even though the brothers seem to find places for themselves in the end.  One highly functional, the other a disastrous psychotic.

Recommended with enthusiasm.  This is a good one to own as it can be watched many times.",1325548800,3,3248,4.875912408759124
