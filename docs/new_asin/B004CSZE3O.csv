And for us Floridians who can forget a tough as nails masked wrestler known as the Texan ( Terry Funk ) & in Texas an equally ruthless masked wrestler known as the Oklahoma Chickasaw ( Jerry Brisco ). These 2 men were excellently mentored by two legends, Eddie Graham & Lou Thesz. Jerry went on to Mid Atlantic Glory with Jim Crockett. Jack was a 2 time NWA Champion & the first National Heavyweight Titleholder along with numerous regional belts. Jerry was NWA Junior Heavyweight Champion, Mid Atlantic Champion & other regional belts. And of course World Tag Team, Florida Tag Team, & other tag team champions. We lost Jack a few years ago. Far too early. This DVD is priceless!!!",1413244800,,823,4.530201342281879
