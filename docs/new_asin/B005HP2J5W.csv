8473425,4,B005HP2J5W,"Survival Tales Of The Wild; is broken into 3 different segments. Lions VS Warthogs, Hunting Dogs, and Jackals The Underdogs. Out of all 3 films, I will be honest and say that Lions VS Warthogs was the most interesting one for me to watch. I guess that can be explained because Jackals, or African Wild Dogs are not that interesting to me. This film is a poor video transfer to Blu-ray, and doesn't look any better than ordinary DVD. Lions VS Warthogs was my favorite of the 3 to watch. It shows a particular lioness pride ignoring the Water Buffalo, and exclusively targeting only Warthogs to hunt.

One segment of the film shows the aftermath of a lioness being severely stabbed in the leg by a Warthog. This Warthog's tusk tore through the upper muscle of the lionesses back leg. Other members of the pride took up the slack because, this lioness was unable to hunt with the pride. Otherwise nothing else stands out about this movie that one can quickly recall. I've had this movie for nearly two months, and I'm just now giving a review because this film was no big deal to me. It is not a bad movie to have in your collection if you admire Jackals and Painted Wild Dogs.",1364083200,3,1174,4.46046511627907
