5409600,5,B00ADQDTU4,Family oriented. Rare nowadays. Nothing decent to much anymore.  I wonder if these actors directors producers have children or if they let them watch the movies the make.  Maybe the should follow Mark Burnett around sometime.,1394236800,,225,5.222222222222222

8550127,4,B00ADQDTU4,"Great pack of family movies! I especially enjoyed Leave Yesterday Behind, which had some great acting from the late Carrie Fisher. While my kids really enjoyed The Mighty. The other movies weren't mad either, those were just our favorites.",1498435200,,239,5.153846153846154

8550133,4,B00ADQDTU4,"I've only looked at 4 of these movies and probably won't look at the other two.  Stories about teachers in the getto don't really interest me and someone teaching music in another getto also isn't anything I want to see right now.  The other 4 movies were o.k. to excellent.  I don't particularly care for John Ritter and the story was too simple for my taste but it was fairly enjoyable. Amy Grant isn't much of an actress but this was an easy role for her and the supporting cast was good.  I like a movie now and then that has all nice people in it and nobody is a mean jerk or criminal.  Mighty is a charming movie even though it has way too much fairy tale in it.  It is like seeing the world through the eyes of the little boy who needs heroes in his life.  Solomon's Choice is an excellent movie.  The story has a lot of shading that make it interesting.  All in all, I'm pleased with the purchase of this set.",1412380800,,917,4.135593220338983
8550134,5,B00ADQDTU4,"I stumbled across this 6-pack on Amazon when I was looking for some John Ritter movies that do not seem to be available. I would rate them all as ""chick flicks"", but that is not necessarily bad. I enjoyed them all. ""Music of the Heart"" is definitely my favorite and we are treated to the fabulous Meryl Streep as the star. It's nice to see some positive entertainment that just makes you feel good for a change. IMHO... Take a break from your stressful life, put your feet up and watch these movies! You will have a smile on your face afterwards.",1404864000,,546,4.362745098039215
8550135,5,B00ADQDTU4,Was looking for Leave Yesterday Behind in dvd format for 15yrs. Was worth the price all by itself but the bonus films are all excellent as well. Heartwarming stories abound and Kleenex for everyone!,1397433600,,198,4.852941176470588
