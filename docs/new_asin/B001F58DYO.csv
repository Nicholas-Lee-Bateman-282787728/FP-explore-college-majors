8301023,5,B001F58DYO,"We were introduced to Noddy and Friends on the Sprout channel, which no longer airs the British show. Our then 2-yr old daughter fell in love the first time she saw it. Even our 8-month old triples (2 boys and a girl) take notice of the show when it was on the TV. We bought the set of 5 DVDs from Wal-mart, which did not include the book. The stories are ~ 10 mins long each and all are educationally based on social situations like sharing, good vs naughty behavior, cooperation, telling the truth, and even counting. The DVD sets also have a 3-4 minute segment in between each story called Say It With Noddy, during which the children are introduced to foreign languages and sounds not normally spoken in the English language. This helps with learning other languages later in life. The animation and colors are outstanding. The characters are engaging and easy for the young to identify with. We highly recommend this fun set - even the adults enjoy watching with the kids.",1278720000,,977,4.588571428571429
8301024,5,B001F58DYO,"If you want to purchase a wonderful,cheerful, happy movie for kids, then this is the set you need! Kids love it as well as adults and the lessons that are taught are priceless! Kids are learning things and don't even realize it because of the beautiful color and wonderful story they watch. Every child and adult needs at least 1 Noddy in their lifetime! My grandkids and I actually do the ""Noddy dance"" to the opening song of the video and they love it!!!!",1249776000,,457,4.4523809523809526
8301025,5,B001F58DYO,"Our twin girls have enjoyed the Noddy series on cable TV since age six months.  The high quality of the graphics and the story lines, the introduction of words in foreign languages, and the diverse demographics of the characters, make this a superb source of edutainment for a wide range of ages.

Our girls recently celebrated their first birthday, and they continue to be entranced by this series.  This is the reason we purchased this DVD collection to take on vacation or to bring to relatives' or friends' homes.  The Noddy Fun Pack truly represents an excellent value.",1248480000,2,574,4.826530612244898
