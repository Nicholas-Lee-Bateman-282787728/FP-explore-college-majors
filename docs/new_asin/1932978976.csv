7801624,5,1932978976,"If you want to learn how to tie a dry fly, this video is for you.  Unless you can get your hands on Del Mazza's video, this video by Dave Brandt is the next best thing.  I have a lot of fly tying ""How to"" videos and most of them dive right in to the tying of the fly but Dave explains why he does what he does.  Yes, it is a distillation of what he has learned over decades of tying but that's called ""learning and process improvement"" folks!

Dave happens to be a personal friend of mine and I can tell you this, he is completely committed to his craft and is constantly looking for a better way to do things.  The one thing he doesn't do for his traditional Catskill flies is tie them with anything other than the traditional materials.  I respect that.  But, as a previous review stated, he does tie and fishes with ""modern"" dry flies.

Don't let the title of this video throw you, if you really want to learn how to tie a dry fly ""perfect"", watch this video ten times and practice, preactice, practice.  Even if you tie, quote ""modern"" dry flies, this video is invaluable.

The mechanics he teaches and explains apply to any fly...especially dry flies.  He also explains what a good hackle is and looks like.  He explains why he whip finishes by hand.  He explains why he uses the thread he does.  He explains why he uses head cement and they way he applies it...albeit it a couple of instances he does rush things and gooks it on...probably because he needed to finish the segment.

If you've ever seen him tie up close and personal at one of the Fly Fishing Shows, he is personable and willing to answer any question you hit hi with.  Oh, and he's also one of the flag-ship instructors at Joan Wulff's casting school.  You should see him cast a fly rod to!",1349222400,,1762,4.2749244712990935
7801625,4,1932978976,"Dave Brandt's video is good information for those who enjoy tying and fishing Catskill style dry flies.  Learn his methods and you will be able to tie nearly every Catskill dry fly pattern from the old masters. Dave spends a lot of time going over materials and details of the tying techniques he uses and most tyers should be able to follow along. His style is his personal distillation of others techniques he has seen over the years. The end result is the same but the road to get there may have some new turns. My criticism is Dave stating he prefers to use modern parachute style flies for his own fishing. He should have left that out as it detracts from the overall enthusiasm for this style of fly that I find still works as good as anyone else's pattern. I give Dave creds for honesty, however.",1303257600,,803,4.425675675675675
