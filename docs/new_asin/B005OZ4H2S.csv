8482154,5,B005OZ4H2S,"I received this collection as a gift. Not sure if it was purchased from Amazon, but this is where I review.  I love old movies and have seen all of these titles many times.  They are amazing in this collection, totally restored, and in color.  They looked like they were filmed in color even.  I'm not sure why it's called Classic Television Comedy though... but still, I am very satisfied with this collection.",1402617600,,411,4.589041095890411
8482155,5,B005OZ4H2S,"What a great collection.  All of the titles have been restored and colorized.  I have always enjoyed Legend Films' work.  They do an amazing job.  I found this collection to be a seal.  10 DVD's for under $50, great case, and the titles also include the restored black and white version.  Awesome.",1402617600,,297,4.615384615384615
8482156,1,B005OZ4H2S,"Legend strikes again, colorized garbage and ""restored"" B&W that isn't restored, just the color turned off. And most of this isn't ""television"" stuff at all, it's the same old theatrical public domain shorts (""Disorder in the Court"", anyone?) that we've seen over and over and over. I don't know why this company still bothers. Junk.",1346544000,3,332,5.054545454545455
