8219800,3,B000VSMWSY,"Starring:David Jackson and Greg Nutt.
A Ray Etheridge classic ACTION flick.
When Drive-Ins still ruled and VHS was a threat to TV,This film would have been the talk of the South !
Filmed in Oregon ?,With Real Bullets,Real car crashes and real dynamite...Who could ever imagine happening on film ?
Ray Etheridge is a different kind of filmmaker,We're not saying this film effort is the reason Ray and Migdalia moved to Florida,But think someone must have died filming at end.
Seriously one of the best endings this side of `Night Of The Living Dead' shock finis.
The bad guy,David Jackson,is still making movies.
Greg Nutt,The helicopter pilot( YOU KNEW it had a helicopter),Flew on Magnum,P.I. and NCIS and JAG series !
Again,The Etheridges deliver entertainment.",1274745600,,763,5.112
8219801,5,B000VSMWSY,"First off, let me say what a shame it is that this movie has been discontinued.  It is the best movie of all time - if you appreciate such titles as Deadbeat at Dawn, Street Trash, Fresh Kill, the Story of Ricki-Oh, and Troma release, or anything by Lucio Fulci - this movie is for you.  It's a shame not enough people bought this product as it has now been discontinued less than two months since I purchased it.  The previews on it alone are more than worth whatever you have to pay for this DVD.  If you understand the kind of movies I listed earlier, this movie is absolutely essential.",1236124800,2,590,4.288288288288288
