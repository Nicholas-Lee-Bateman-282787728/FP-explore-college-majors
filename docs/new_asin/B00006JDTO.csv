1779404,5,B00006JDTO,"So much for our beloved heroine, Patty, she got what was coming to her. It is too bad she got the guillotine, but there was no real way for her to escape anyway. The DVD for the image of the beast is pretty good. You get to know about Russ Doughten, the man who played our left behind preacher, and you get a really neat commentary along with it.

As the story of the end times goes on, David Michaels (William Wellman) takes over for our beloved Patty, who no longer has a head. When he meets up with Leslie (Wenda Shereos) and Cathy (Susan Plumb) and Cathy's three year old boy, the three set out to find salvation, and to find a way to keep out of sight from Unite. When Leslie is assumed dead after being shot, David decides maybe its time to give Unite a piece of their own medicine. As the two try to thwart Unites plans, and using their new counterfiet mark that David has invented, they can do things they never thought possible with the lord on their side. But the Tribulation gets worse as the things prodicted are becoming a reality, and Brother Christopher a.k.a. the antichrist, will stop at nothing until everyone is under his wing.

I think that this was better than A Distant Thunder for two reasons because one: There was a lot more suspense than in the second in the series. The action is also much better in the ways the budget is also much bigger and two: The plot seemed much more thought out and well written than a Distant Thunder. One thing that it lacked from A Thief in the Night was the message. It was displayed wonderfully in the end by Leslie and Billy's performance which was awesome, but it wasn't shown throughout the film as much in A Thief in the night.

I think that the action in the film is the best because it matches A Thief in the Night's (partly because there was no actiong A Distant Thunder) but still keeps it to the limit of christian filmmaking which is pretty hard. For instance, I think the best scene in the film is probably Patty's death scene. As the earthquake drives everyone away, you feel the guillotine. YOu feel it about to slip off it's last tether yet you desperately want Patty to get out but she just can't. As I watched the hook slip right off to the last centimeter, I really wanted Patty to get out. She was my favorite character, but I suppose her end was just. She was pretty much damning herself by screaming ""I want the mark!"". That's just as bad as taking it!

I hope Mark IV pictures continues to make films. After the Prodigal Planet came out, Mark IV simply petered out but still exists under a different name. I still like calling it Mark IV. If you bought the DVD, you probably know they're trying to make the fifth thief in the night which will finish the series. 35.5 million dollars is a lot of money to raise for an independent film company, especially since A Thief in the Night only cost $60,000 to make (the equivalent of $300,000 today). I hope they will. Status currently is ""it's going slow"" as I've been told by the people at Mark IV pictures and Russ Doughten films. Give them a call. You might be able to help!",1087776000,8,3098,4.336206896551724
1779405,5,B00006JDTO,"Patty gets the axe, I mean, guillotine, in this film.  A real shame, really.  Patty's death was actually celebrated in my family's house.  When she died, mother ordered pizza.  Sorry.
  This happens to be the best of the set of films, though I'd say Distant thunder claims the right to be second-best.  This one continues the studies of the prophecies, but it begins to deflect somewhat off of the pure story.
  This film also reflects the required fear of computers, technologies, and modernity.  Here, instead of the panicky and furious Patty, we are left with David.  David is a computer expert.  David, and his new assistant, Cathy, a computer analyst who takes Patty's place but is far more rational, begin working on a counterfiet mark.
  Cathy correctly indicates the moral implications of this critical issue.  But David rebuffs her, arguing a matter of survival is greater than his committment to Christ.
  You shall find that David is a hypocrite in some respects, and while he is more biblically trained than most people, he is so innately disgusting, one almost roots for Jerry and Dianne.
  Of these films, however, this one truly hypes up the emotional terror without Patty there to scream every 2.15 seconds, forcing you to imagine the implications for yourself.
  A bit of advice, don't drink water during the final third of the movie.",1065916800,7,1351,4.889380530973451
1779406,5,B00006JDTO,"It is evident that Patty went to Hell.  Those that had an open confession to the Lord went to Heaven (ie, were saved).  Patty NEVER prayed the prayer (as her husband did) and so she went to Hell.
Revelation 20:4
""And I saw the thrones, and they that sat upon them, and judgement was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.""
The part of this verse that refers to Patty's situation is ""for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God"".  This refers to Christians who were saved in the tribulation.  It does not refer to a person who just simply ran from the Antichrist and refused to take the ""mark"".  Anyone can do that and still refuse to accept Jesus as the Lord of their life.  I think we see in this scene just how selfish and rebellious Patty still is.  She WILL NOT allow Jesus to be the boss of her life, even in a time of trouble and terror.
I'm still a big fan of the Thief in the Night series....",1049414400,8,1169,4.168888888888889
1779407,1,B00006JDTO,"Oh yes, rest assured, there will be nightmares. There will also be a turning away from religion, and probably therapy in later years. Ask anyone in Generation X who saw this as children, when we were bused to churches in large crowds. These 4 movies are one major reason for our ""issues"" as a generation. We all lived in constant fear of 5 things: the Rapture, the Russians, the vampires, the aliens, and nuclear annihilation in World War III. Many of us grew up listening for cars & trains passing so we'd know the world hadn't ended yet, i.e., the Rapture hadn't yet come, but probably would tonight or tomorrow.",1010620800,14,614,4.590909090909091
1779408,5,B00006JDTO,"First of all let me start by saying that IOTB was so ahead of it's time. Russ Doughton and Donald Thompson out did themselves on this one.
The opening sequence was the most powerful to me. It focuses on a UPC bar Code on the back of some grocery product. This shot was key because the producers were fortelling what was to come. You have to remember that when this film was produced (1981) bar codes were still relatively new and not on all products. Now in 2001 we all have bar codes everywhere including on us.
They also focus earlier than that on computers and how they would take over the world. Back then the saints didn't understand how much computers would be involved in our everyday lives.
I was 6 years old when I first saw this film on 16mm at church. My father first introduced the series with A Thief in the Night then it's sequel A Distant Thunder. Both in which Patty Dunning did an excellent Job. But NONE could compare to her short but genius performance in IOTB.
The guillotine sequence is where we find Patty getting slapped by Jerry to hopefully drive some sense into her. The FAMOUS theme music to these films RAGE out "" duh-duh-duh-duhn..d-d-d-duhn "" that music to this day scares the mess out of me.
The way that Patty resists going to the guillotine and squeels was excellent. Especially when they started to lay her down she was shaking and crying hysterically. All of this made this scene so authentic.
But the key was when she was strapped about to go through with the execution , the skies turn pitch black and an EARTHQUAKE rips through the foundation where the guillotine stood with Patty still in it.
Something like this in a Christian film in 1981 to a 6 year old was TERRIFYING. Nothing before or since this sequence HAD EVER been done before. The rapture films of today are too polite. Mark IV pictures told the truth an scared literally the HELL out of you.
The trip in this scene is the fact that Patty confesses openly that she now wants the mark...over and over again while the guillotine is shaking but no one cares about her, they just left her by herself.
Suspense builds as you get several veiws of Patty's position and the Blade slowly about to slip off the hook. Excellent choice of string scoring throughout this sequence because the strings accentuate the feeling of panic and urgency to get free from the straps that held Patty down.
Finally, the blade slips off - Patty's shrieking screams send chills down your spine and an awesome first person perspective shot of the blade coming down makes you feel like you're in it with her and CUT to BLACK.
I remember the church screaming in shock that this was actually being shown in the dark. Some of the members requested to have some of the lights turned on because they were scared. I cupped my ears after that and was too afraid to watch it until maybe 7 years later on VHS
I thought that the rest of the film could have been scarier though. After three films we finally lost PATTY and honestly after that the series lost it's punch to me.
I still continue to show this opening sequence to people all the time and I get the same reaction I got when  I was six....TERROR.
After I show the sequence I ask the question ""Did Patty go to hell because of her open confession of wanting the mark ? ""  OR  "" Did God still honor it because she really only said it due to the fact that she was frigthened by the quake  ? """,983318400,21,3408,4.396196513470682

1779417,5,B00006JDTO,"This movie is different from the rest of the series in various aspects.  First, while the first two movies move from the present to a flashback, this one started with the flashback.  Second, Patty Dunning's character, which was the lead in the first two movies, loses her head and exits the story early in the movie.  To take over the lead role is William Wellman Jr. as David Michaels, who is a better action character.

The scripting is great.  I've seen this movie several times in a church setting, and there is one line I've never been able to understand (towards the end of the movie), because Wellman's previous line sparked loud applause from the audience.

I would follow the series in order, but this is my favorite.",1169337600,3,726,4.6328125

Many people complain about her whining, but you have to remember patty was a gymnast in real life turned actress at the the last minute before production began on TITN.  She is not Gweneth Paltrow so give her a break guys.

The guillotine sequence is where we find Patty getting slapped by Jerry to hopefully drive some sense into her. The FAMOUS theme music to these films RAGE out "" duh-duh-duh-duhn..d-d-d-duhn "" that music to this day scares the mess out of me.

The way that Patty resists going to the guillotine and squeels was excellent. Especially when they started to lay her down she was shaking and crying hysterically. All of this made this scene so authentic. The Art direction for this series was the most detailed with the UNITE garb everywhere for everyone to see.

(* A small note: The Gold and Blue UNITE VANS were red,white,and blue in TITN. In this series there are several types of unite vans and helicopters which probably means a bigger budget.)

But the key was when she was strapped about to go through with the execution , the skies turn pitch black and an EARTHQUAKE rips through the foundation where the guillotine stood with Patty still in it.

Something like this in a Christian film in 1981 to a 6 year old was TERRIFYING. Nothing before or since this sequence HAD EVER been done before. The rapture films of today are too polite. Mark IV pictures told the truth an scared literally the HELL out of you.

The trip in this scene is the fact that Patty confesses openly that she now wants the mark...over and over again while the guillotine is shaking but no one cares about her, they just left her by herself. This was real. And this was her best acting by far out of all of the series. Most christians would say ....""oh she deserved it , she lost her faith in God ! "" but realistically most people would probably change their minds under the circumstances. I think that's why this scene was so scary. She was screaming what she thought they wanted to hear so they would let her get to saftey along with them but they all just ignored her.  Leslie almost turned around to help her but she probably thought, the lord made a way for me to escape so I better not chance it.

7969980,5,B00006JDTO,"This series is great, the movies of course are made at the time of color but no HD or special effects; that said it pretty much covers everything biblically.  If they were re-made today and they expanded on the horrors of the disasters, pestilence, etc...it might be scarier for some and perhaps more effective.  But in a way, I think it's perfect the way it is.  The second movie in the series really covers well why we are sinners and need Jesus's blood to cleanse us from your sins.  I highly recommend this series to everyone, especially those who have not accepted the Lord Jesus as their Savior, being good, going to church doesn't cut it.  Time is running out Jesus is coming soon!  If you miss the rapture, please accept Jesus right away because He will send a strong delusion to people who heard about salvation before, yet denied it and wouldn't accept the free gift of everlasting life through the belief in the cleansing blood of Jesus Christ.  Do not worship the beast or take the mark of the beast or you'll loose your soul to Satan, but if you don't repent before the end of the seven year tribulation period you will loose your soul anyway.  He knows our hearts too, you have to truly believe.  Jesus said, ""I am the way, and the truth, and the life.  No one comes to the Father except  through me."" John 14:6. ""For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.""

Someone commented something to the effect that, ""the rapture happens at the last trumpet not the first"".  For some reason people think that the Rapture happens at the time of the Trumpet Judgments, at the last one or in between the sixth and last trumpet judgements.  I guess because they are called 'trumpet' judgments.  The fact that they are called trumpet judgments has nothing to do with it.  There is no biblical proof it happens there.  In fact, why would it happen so late.  Christians are not appointed to God's wrath which not only includes the judgments of the first six trumpets but also the seven seals opened by the Lamb of God - Jesus.  Plus I hardly doubt Jesus would come to rapture His believers out during such a terrible time.  Significant events of our Lord always happens on the Feast Days of the Lord.  The next one to be fulfilled is The Feast of Trumpets which is a feast of blowing trumpets.  There are a series of 100 total, the last trumpet blast is long and drawn out, unlike the others.  He will come then, at a time we really don't know.  The Feast of Trumpets in 2017 is significant this year because on September 23, 2017 there will be a sign in the heavens, the sun, moon, stars and and planets that matches perfectly with Revelation 12:1-2.  Check it out on you tube and stellarium software(free).  Again, great movie, great series - watch all four and share them with others.",1502409600,,2882,4.494230769230769
