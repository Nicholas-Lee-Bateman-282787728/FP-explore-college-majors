4892897,5,B005TZFZF6,"I saw this movie on opening night in Newton.  It was reminiscent of the spelling bee and crossword documentaries.  We loved it and were lucky to have the director and head judge talk to us about the show afterwards. Don't miss this great movie that not only gives you the history of the game, but delves into the personalities of the most avid players.",1329177600,4,352,4.484375
4892898,5,B005TZFZF6,"A documentary about a board game is not something I would typically think to go see, but I'm glad I saw this!  This was a fun and very entertaining look at the game of monopoly.  Through the overarching stories of real people preparing for a monopoly tournament, it covers the many ways in which the game has become a part of not only American pop culture, but many cultures around the world, the woman who invented the first version of the game, people's favorite tokens, and much more.  Well done Mr. Tostado!",1328659200,6,511,4.532608695652174

4892921,4,B005TZFZF6,Engaging. Exciting and informative.  A great documentary.,1421452800,2,57,7.142857142857143

4892923,1,B005TZFZF6,It's mostly about the monopoly tournament. And not so much about the history of the game.,1417824000,2,89,4.625
4892924,5,B005TZFZF6,"I bought this blindly because I love Monopoly, and this documentary does not disappoint.  It focuses a lot on the World Monopoly Championships, but there is still quite a bit on the history of the game as well as some collectors who have a stash of Monopoly stuff that is to die for.  Special features include a commentary track that sheds some light into the challenges of making a movie about a board game, but their love for the game and dedication to the subject made it worth it in the end.

Really a great documentary even for non-die hard fans of the game.",1403913600,4,563,4.394230769230769
4892925,2,B005TZFZF6,"As others have pointed out, despite the description shown here and on Netflix, this is not a documentary focusing on the history of Monopoly. In fact the film comprises only about twenty minutes of history scattered throughout. These scenes are interesting and are depicted well with snazzy graphics and old photos, but most of the film is devoted to a Monopoly tournament and the players vying for the top spot.

We've seen this before. Going at least as far back as ""Pumping Iron"" and continuing through such fine docs as ""Almost Elvis,"" Spellbound,"" and ""Word Wars,"" a film like this is only as good as the subjects being followed. Alas, that's the biggest problem here, as the players all fit the same boring mold--middle-aged, middle-class white guys who grew up loving the game because they played it with their families. Hearing that same narrative gets old fast, but the filmmakers give each gaming nerd the same opportunity to share the same story of why he/she fell in love with the game.

The tournament itself is a letdown as well, as the game involves more luck than something like a spelling bee or a Scrabble competition. The finalists all know the ins and outs, so it's mostly a matter of who lands on what. Compounding the problem, the game played is sped up with the inclusion of a third die. Couldn't they at least have let the finalists play a normal game of Monopoly?

I will be skipping any future board game docs. Tempt me not with a film exploring Game of Life fanatics.",1374019200,3,1494,4.673003802281369
4892926,5,B005TZFZF6,This documentary is interesting but I was hoping that it would have gone more into the history of the game.,1369267200,2,107,4.4
4892927,5,B005TZFZF6,"With the caveat that I know one of the creators of this film, I really enjoyed this film. It's particularly fascinating to hear about the context of the game's early development.",1361145600,3,178,4.774193548387097
4892928,4,B005TZFZF6,"I hate Monopoly.  Most serious boardgamers hate Monopoly.  Aside from a few snippets from W. Eric Martin in this film, you won't find a critical word to be said about this game.  The section that examined people collecting 100 different versions of Monopoly was beyond depressing.  And why does a Simpsons fan simply HAVE to own a copy of Simpsons Monopoly?  Yikes.

It's an entertaining documentary when it focuses on the various players competing in the US and World Monopoly championships.  While it doesn't surprise me that there is a World Monopoly championship, I can't say I ever was aware that it existed before watching this movie.  The seriousness with which the game is approached by some of these players (Ken Koury and his team of coaches, for example) is equally amusing and scary.  One can only imagine what these guys would do with a game like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Macher/dp/B0013NLBO2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Macher</a>, for example.  Actually, the seriousness of the competitors leading up to the actual championship match makes the final result somewhat anticlimactic.  It seems like the final game is over in about two minutes.  All that hard work and preparation for THIS?

I honestly don't know if fans of Monopoly will like this or not.  People who enjoy learning about some of our quirkier subcultures may enjoy this.

And the red die doesn't make Monopoly any less lousy...it just makes it lousy for a shorter period of time.",1347148800,2,1515,5.30672268907563
4892929,2,B005TZFZF6,"I hate the red die in Monopoly! It feeds the American sensibility of chronic insatiability and instant gratification. That said, this film was mildly entertaining. Very entertaining if you're a hardcore fan of Monopoly. Like most documentaries covering big brands, it presents very little controversy or negative portrayals of the brand; otherwise, the film doesn't get access to the corporate VPs of the game, or entry into the world championship in Las Vegas, and, thus, no movie about Monopoly. To its credit, the film does uncover the original idea behind the game, that is, to show the evils of capitalism and consumption, but that message is quickly replaced by how Monopoly helps children learn math and brings the family together. True, but for all the wrong reasons -- competition and collusion. At the table, nobody is trying to get to know each other better, but solely focused on winning the game. At the same time, the film touts how the game reflects the real world of business and real estate, but never mentions the consequences of playing such a game. What happens to those who go bankrupt? The focus is on the winner, not the poor and the homeless. Ultimately, Monopoly is an awful reflection of American values. Why can't there be a game with the goal of becoming the biggest philanthropist or humanitarian?",1331337600,4,1326,4.924107142857143
4892930,5,B005TZFZF6,"First off, I'm not sure why but at least two of my fellow reviewers posted their reviews of this DVD TWICE. I was surprised that Amazon let these go through. I'll be posting this one ONCE and hopefully it will only appear once. Now on to my review:

There must be thousands (millions?) of Monopoly players and fans out there and so this wonderful 88-minute documentary - which played at a number of film festivals - should do well. Just looking at the list of ""thank you""s in the closing credits I think I counted more than 150 people!

I have to admit that I actually haven't played Monopoly in years but, like the Academy Award Winning film ""Word play"" (about the World Crossword Puzzle Championships), this documentary will fascinate even the Monopoly-novice. It's a pop culture thing and for 75 years or more has kept families playing around the world.

The Director got interviews with every person significant to the Monopoly story. There is the grandson of the game's inventor Charles Darrow (who explains that when Parker Brothers bought the rights to the game they chose to pay a royalty to Darrow and his descendents, rather than a full outright purchase of the game and logo), the former head of Parker Brothers (now a division of Mattel) and the first winner of the Monopoly World Championship in 1973. (The World Championship is held every 4 or 5 years.)

Though the film - made in 2010 - leads up to the 2009 World Championships in Las Vegas - the pacing is such that you learn the history of the game, the personal lives of the competitors and the passion for those who collect the Monopoly logo items. The 2009 World Finals are covered in just the last 6 minutes of the film.

The bonuses will be a delight to Monopoly fans: There's a feature on ""Methods, Myths and Math"" of Monopoly, two extended scenes (5-6 minutes each), a minute of outtakes, a qualifying quiz and, finally, for those who want to see the full coverage of the 2009 tournament - there is a 42-minute featurette.

So, if you are a Monopoly fan, you WILL want to see this. But, even if you aren't, it's a well-done documentary worth seeing.

I hope you found this review both helpful and informative.

8486643,5,B005TZFZF6,"Producer Kevin Tostado shows that there than meets the eye for players of the game Monopoly in the documentary Under the Boardwalk: The Monopoly Story.  In more than an hour, the meaning of the game goes beyond pieces on a board gme but a way of life for diehard fans, experts, and former chmps of the game. The documentary focuses on the 2009 World Championship but within the parameters is the story behind the game that began with a patent for a game created by Illinois Quaker Elizabeth Magie in 1903 but later passed on to several people until it landed in the hands of Charles Darrow 30 years later.

The documentary is entertaining, educational, and informative in so many ways. For viewers that have played Monopoly since childhood it is near and dear and filled with fond memories of family and friends gathering and competing. The game was initially created to teach about capitalism and the results of the Great Depression, but with any form of actuvity that brings people together food, literature and music, and for this example play. The game has its place in history, especially during the Holocaust and World War II at a POW camp, and series of cameos and references of the game being played. In addition the game has gone through changes through the years from its first inception as a hand-made board game that had game pieces that originated from a charm bracelet; with that footnote, according to players of the game everyone has had a favorite, the iron, racecar, wheelbarrow, and tophat, the documentary was filmed in 2009 and since, the iron was replaced by a cat and the wheelbarrow, thimble, and boot were replaced by a few tokens of a T-Rex, ducky, and penguin.

In spite of the evolution that the game Monopoly experienced in its over 80 year history, it is an instution to everyone that has played it and has been shared with the rest of the world.",1489881600,4,1876,4.678787878787879

When the board makers finally came around to the realization that the game was worth making the family asked for and received a royalty of which they receive to this day.
