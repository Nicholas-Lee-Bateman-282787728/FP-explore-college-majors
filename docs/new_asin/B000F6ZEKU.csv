So often I get videos for teaching religious ed and am disappointed, but this one surprised me.  It is funny, compelling, and surprising.  Mostly inspirational.  Actually it's a great video not only for my older students (6th grade through 11th grade), but for the teachers.  It reminds us about the real values of living and supporting each other on our journey to heaven.",1364083200,,551,6.293333333333333

Humorously & interestingly presented & understandable even for young children.",1357776000,,244,4.809523809523809
