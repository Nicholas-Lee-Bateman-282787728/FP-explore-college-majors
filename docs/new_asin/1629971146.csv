Well produced and does a good job of simplifying this topic (which is a tough task by itself already) as much as possible. Honestly I suck at physics but I am very curious person (only class I never passed in HS and I got an overall GPA of 3.33, repeating of course) but I was still able to grasp some of the stuff; going through some scenes or concepts again will be inevitable depending on your grasp of physics. Physics is some really serious stuff so if you expect to know everything about it in one go, especially if you have little knowledge of it, then you will be inevitable dissapointed in this and probably other educational physic materials out there ,but if you are patient and curious then this will be quite helpful for you.

7800691,2,1629971146,Wow.  This should never have become a DVD presentation.  Its like going to a terrible church sermon.,1526256000,,100,4.823529411764706
7800692,4,1629971146,"First of all, I would like a spreadsheet that lingers at the end of each lecture to remind me of all the fermions and leptons and charges and spins and colors.  I would like more diagrams in general so I have more pictures in my mind.  I like the topics but I need it to sink in more.",1517011200,,284,3.8793103448275863
7800693,5,1629971146,I am physics student and I am doing a particle physics research in a national lab. I am very happy to discover these lectures! It's good start for beginners and great review/overview over the standard material people learn in undergrad particle physics courses. Very recommend these videos!,1502323200,,290,5.191489361702128
7800694,5,1629971146,"Excellent -- so much more than just an update on Higgs-Boson, this engaging speaker uses great graphics and really gives you/explains the entire foundation of modern physics",1487289600,,173,5.444444444444445
7800695,5,1629971146,Bought this for my husband as his hobby is physics and he loves this professor,1485993600,,78,4.266666666666667
7800696,5,1629971146,"Excellent course.  I am a former physics student, and still learned a lot.",1485561600,,74,4.6923076923076925
7800697,5,1629971146,"I'm a college professor, and my years as a student are still fresh enough in my mind that I remember it from that perspective as well. This is very well done. The professor is engaging,and the book is a good companion to the videos.

You get two CDs with 12 30-minute lectures and a 86 page book that includes sources and questions to consider at the end of each paragraph. There are typically 24- 32 college class sessions for 100 to 75 minutes, respectively and maybe 3-4 times as much reading material. Obviously this falls short of that and there isn't the option to ask the professor follow up questions. However, if as you're watching you keep Google open and search terms and ideas (that are not in the text,  lot of the stuff is further covered there, remember) that can really enhance the learning experience. I'm still nowhere near finished with it. I watch and read a little at a time. A great thing about it is you can go through it as quickly as you like.

The subject matter here is very interesting. You do NOT need any science background; this approaches the subject from a layman's perspective. For those that do have a scientific background, this might not be interesting, because much of it explains  things like matter and energy, quantum field theory, colliding particles and accelerators. This is NOT a course in math concepts. It only teaches you enough of those basics so you can truly understand the Higgs Boson. That said, it does give you a enough infofrmation that you feel like you've learned a lot about a never of different scientific principles.

I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest review, and I'm thrilled I took advantage of it.",1467936000,,1683,4.634228187919463
7800698,5,1629971146,Great course. The instructor has a wonderful presentation style that is easy to understand and he explains things well.,1467676800,,119,5.315789473684211
7800699,4,1629971146,"So far I'm quite pleased with this purchase. Since I watched the tv show ""Numbers"" I've been very interested in the Higgs Boson. As a student pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering and another Bachelor's Degree in Applied Mathematics, math and science definitely interest me, so if you don't like the idea of physics, steer clear. Professor Sean Carroll does a pretty good job of explaining the necessary details for a novice in particle physics. There are twelve lectures that come in the form of two dvd discs and this also includes a paperback guidebook to help you navigate through the course. The reason I give this four stars instead of five is because the audio is not the best (though it's not bad) and the Professor does misspeak occasionally as anyone would in daily conversations or presentations. It is also a little reminiscent of high school science videos in the introduction (read, a little cheesy and graphics are from the previous decade). All in all, I enjoyed this course and expect to buy more ""Great Courses"" in the future as a result.

This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. This had no impact on how I reviewed the product. All of the review is my own and would not be different had I paid full price.",1464739200,,1284,4.706666666666667
7800700,5,1629971146,"The Higgs Boson and Beyond DVD set is a great edition to The Great Courses!
My family and I own 35+ of these DVD sets and I jumped at the chance to purchase The Higgs Boson and Beyond editon from Amazon. The Higgs Boson particle was discovered in 2012, so this is relatively new course material that The Great Courses is always adding to their library.
This 2 disc set starts off talking about how we came to know particle physics, the atom, particles and electrons fields starting from ancient Greek philosophers. This goes in-depth as to the definition of the Higgs field and the Higgs Boson particle in a manner than is digestible to most everyone. You really get out of it, build-able information based on what you bring before watching the material. You learning something new every time you watch. We have found all of The Great Courses to be the ""encyclopedias"" of the day, helping our kids learning and grow in school and in knowledge as well as my husband and I.
I was lucky enough to purchase this DVD set at a discount in exchange for my review of this product, but we have purchased 33+ at full price because of our love of the material and the value they present. I hope they bring the same in your home.",1464134400,,1217,4.4375
