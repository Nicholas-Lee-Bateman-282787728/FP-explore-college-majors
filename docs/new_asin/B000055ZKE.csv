1395663,4,B000055ZKE,"Don't misinterpret this phrase as meaning it was awful. That would be far from the truth. This pay-per-view Rocked? This was the Rocks first ppv since Wrestlemania X-7. This is part 2 to the invasion, with Stone Cold who defected to the alliance defended his wwf title against Kurt Angle. Here is how I rate the matches. 1 star-dud 2 star-purgatory 3 star-ok 4 star-good 5 star-great. Edge vs. Lance Storm(champion) for the intercontinental championship.-4, two superb athletes going at it equal a good opening bout. APA/Spike Dudley vs. Dudleyz/Test-2, had the ability to be at least a 3 star rating. Too fast of a pace, plus stupid ending. Tajiri(lightheavyweight champion) vs. X-pac(WCW Cruserweight champion) title vs. title-41/2, Both men worked hard and it showed in this match. My only problem is that it was title vs. title #1 of the night the other still to come. I think they should have told us during the show that earlier they fliped a coin to determine which belt was at stake, at least it would have kept the wwf from being repetionous for one night. Jericho vs. Rhyno w/ Stephanie McMahon Helmsley-31/2, could have been more solid, a couple of mistakes by jericho hindered this otherwise awesome display of athleticism. RVD vs. Jeff Hardy(Hardcore champion) Hardcore Ladder Match for the title-5, Once again they steal this ppv as they did InVasion. They work wonderfully together. UnderTaker/Kane(wcw champions)vs. DDP/Kanyon(wwf champions)in a steel Cage for the WWF/WCW championships, title vs. title-5, brutallity at its best. Who better than the Brothers of Destruction. Stone Cold(wwf champion)vs. Kurt Angle for the wwf championship-4,Both men displayed how determined they were to win this match, that one,two,three referees were unable to keep in line. Good solid match with a surprise ending. Main Event The Rock vs. Booker T(wcw champion)for the wcw championship-5, finally the rock has layed the smackdown to this spinarooni jabrooni. What a main event! The Rock looked as good as ever before. But MR. T did go one on one with the great one in one wild ride. I strongly recommend this on vhs or dvd. Great ppv from beginning to end!",998179200,,2160,5.0363128491620115

1395688,5,B000055ZKE,"SummerSlam continued the Invasion fued between the WWE and the Alliance. SummerSlam was probably the second best ppv of the year with Wrestlemania being first. A great ppv to pick up sometime.

1. Intercontinental Title
Edge vs. Lance Storm
A very good competitive match up. Storm and Edge blended in very well with each other and both men showed us how talented they really are. Christian would interfere but it was only to set up his fued with Edge for the upcoming weeks ahead. A great opening contest. 4.5/5

2. Six Man Tag Match
APA & Spike Dudley vs. The Dudleyz & Test
Very good follow up to the IC title match. APA pulled off good double teamed moves with some good impact shots. Good hard impacts moves in this one. Spike would get sent through a table. Shane would come out & screw the APA but would get his later in the ppv. Very good six man tag. 4/5

3. Title for Title
Light Heavyweight Champion Tajiri vs. Cruiserweight Champion X-Pac
This was a fun and exciting match to watch. The match was very fast paced & had some nice reversals to take place. A lot of viscious kicks too in this one. A little high risk as well. The cruiserweights delivered here. 4.25/5

4. Rhyno with Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley vs. Chris Jericho
Pretty agressive match. Rhyno would gore Jericho out of mid-air on the outside which would allow Rhyno to work on the injured ribs of Jericho. Rhyno was able to lock on very good submissions on Jericho & even using the Walls of Jericho on Jericho himself. The match had a good comedic spot with Jericho kissing Stephanie. Jericho & Rhyno had a good match here. 4.5/5

5. Ladder Match for the Hardcore Title
Jeff Hardy vs. RVD
This is another match that delivered. The ladder was used at perfect times when it needed to be used. Both Hardy & Van Dam pulled off some good and unique moves with the ladders. Hardy would get suplexed off the top of the ladder and Van Dam would get sunset flipped off the ladder. I have to say this match didn't lived up their match they had at Invasion but it was still good nevertheless. 4.5/5

6. Steel Cage Match for the WWE & WCW Tag Team Titles
DDP & Kanyon vs. Undertaker and Kane with Sara
I have to say the fued between Taker & DDP was the most personal during the Invasion angle. I also have to say that this match was the weakest on the card. The match didn't suck but it was just all Taker and Kane. DDP and Kanyon got in some shots here and there but nothing that was notable. DDP would get left all alone with Kane & Taker inside the cage and then Taker and Kane would just beat on DDP. Just pure dominance from the Brothers of Destruction. 3.5/5

7. WWE Championship
Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Kurt Angle
WOW, what a great match. This could have been the best match throughout the Invasion fued. The match would start out as a brawl on the outside before it would start in the ring. This too was an agressive and physical match. Angle would bleed a lot here and also take a lot of shots to the ring post on the outside. Very good action took place on the outside too. Some good suplexes and counters. Both men brought their best in this match. The dqs at the end didn't hurt the match either, some will say they did but to me they didn't. Just a fantastic match. 5/5

8. WCW Championship
The Rock vs. Booker T with Shane McMahon
This match was very high energetic. Phenomenal action in the ring and on the outside. Booker t would get the advantage on the outside and soon take control of the match. Shane would interfere but would soon take a hard clothesline from hell from Bradshaw and the get rock bottomed on the floor by the Rock. Some good near falls and a great title match. Very good main event. 4.75/5

SummerSlam 2001 was a great event. I highly recommend on this one.",1220832000,,3759,4.3585714285714285
1395689,4,B000055ZKE,"It was!  I swear.

Also, a typo notice; the main event was The Rock vs Booker T for the WCW Championship, but in the chapters page, it lists the WWF Championship match as the last (main) event of the night.

Acolytes Protection Agency and Spike Dudley vs The Dudley Boys and Test
Considering I remember absolutely nothing or less of this match, it must have not been that good.  I always remember decent matches... this was not one of them.  (5/10)

WWF Lightheavyweight Championship and WCW Cruiserweight Championship
Tajiri (C) vs X-Pac (C)
Phenomenal.  That's what this match was.  X-Pac played like a heavyweight cruiserweight, and Tajiri was a perfect balance for him.  Way too short, not nearly hyped enough, it was easily one of the greater matches of the night.  (10/10)

Rhyno vs Chris Jericho
A stale little matchup.  This was nowhere near as great as these two could have done... it was as if the bookers said ""You two are brawlers---fight as brawlers"" and the two were disillusioned by that, so they put a half-hearted effort.  It was lame.  (4/10)

WWF Hardcore Championship Ladder Match
Rob Van Dam vs Jeff Hardy (C)
Anyone who thinks their Invasion match was better needs to smack themselves a few times and re-evaluate their wrestling appreciation.  This was one of the best ladder matches of all time.  I have to say it was the greatest bit of old ECW seen since ECW One Night Stand 2005.  This is one of those that deserve to be a match of the year candidate.  There was not a slow moment in this match; even the opening pick-up was full of chain-wrestling and quick spots.  (10/10)

WWF Tag Team Championship
The Undertaker (C) and Kane (C) vs Diamond Dallas Page and Kanyon
DDP is the quintessential example of the WWF booking a WCW powerplayer to be the most buffoonish and absolute worst thing to hit wrestling ever.  They ruined his reputation, and they didn't even give him any sort of upper hand over the Undertaker---he stalked his ugly wife Sara, then got his ass beaten without ever once looking like a legitimate threat.

This match was the culmination of that... Kanyon and DDP got NO offense in.  It was a glorified squash match which for some reason took place in a cage.  Kanyon leaves the cage and DDP is smashed by the Undertaker.  And there goes one of the absolute worst feuds and worst superstar bookings in WWF history.  (0/10)

WWF Championship
Stone Cold Steve Austin (C) vs Kurt Angle
I've seen this match so many times before, it seems like... Unforgiven 2001, No Mercy 2001, Survivor Series 2001... it got old after the first time (which this apparently is, but for me it was the third) and nothing changed in it---same old s-word, nothing remarkable, purely boring.  (3/10)

WCW Championship
Booker T (C) vs The Rock
The only reason this is in the main event is because The Rock has returned from filming his movie and has supported the WWF.  If you think Booker T is going to win, you're clearly not a wrestling fan.  It was mildly entertaining, but not nearly a stellar or breakout match.  (6/10)

Also, why are people listing Edge vs Lance Storm as a match here?  It wasn't on the DVD---unless it was some hidden extra.  I watched all the extras except Stone Cold appreciation night because that was boring me too hard.",1212537600,,3267,4.640488656195463
1395690,4,B000055ZKE,"This was during the time that the WWF was continuing it's Invasion angle. While not all fans will agree that this angle was handled right by the WWF, I don't think anyone can disagree that with the all talent involved during this angle, made these PPV cards fun to watch. That was the case here as this was one of the best SummerSlams of all time.

Intercontinental Champion Lance Storm vs Edge. Edge was really breaking into his own in the singles division by this point in time while this match also continued the tease breakup of Edge & Christian. Lance Storm stated that this was his best match during his WWF run as this was just a great wrestling match with both men going back & forth exchanging move after move with Christian making a cameo appearance near the end.

Dudley Boyz & Test vs A.P.A. & Spike Dudley. This didn't last long but this was fun match to watch as everyone did a great job in holding their own with their brawling/wrestling style with two moments to look out for being Spike being thrown through a table & Shane McMahon delivering a sick chairshot to Bradshaw's head.

WWF Light Heavyweight Champion Tajiri vs WCW Cruiserweight Champion X-Pac. The first unification match of the night as these two put on a great match by keeping the action at a fast paced throughout with the only request that I would have had is that this match could have been a little longer since the action was so fast that the match felt a little short.

Chris Jericho vs Rhyno w/Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley. The storyline here was that Jericho had never defeated Rhyno while at the same time, continued to insult Stephanie for weeks. However, unlike Jericho's WM 18 match with Triple H, this match didn't revolve around Stephanie so this was a solid contest that did get slow at times but never lost it's momentum. One highlight here would be Rhyno goring Jericho in mid-air to the arena floor that was sick on impact.

Ladder Match: Hardcore Champion Jeff Hardy vs Rob Van Dam. This match didn't top their Invasion classic from the month prior but on it's own this was still something to watch as these two take some sick bumps like Jeff delivering a sun set flip into a powerbomb from the top of a ladder along with RVD using his offense to make his regular moves more impactful with the help of the ladder. There were a few botches for some of the stuff they were doing but this still delivered.

Steel Cage Match: WCW Tag Team Champions The Undertaker & Kane vs WWF Tag Team Champions DDP & Kanyon. This match resembled exactly what this feud was all about & that was a complete squash as Taker & Kane just destroyed DDP & Kanyon with them only getting a few but not enough offense in before Taker & Kane let Kanyon go so they could double-team DDP for the win. It wasn't boring or horrible but that's all this match was a squash.

WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Kurt Angle. This was a lost classic encounter & their best match together that still stands out to this day as Austin was really aggressive throughout the match & just gave Angle a beating that eventually lead to Kurt being heavily busted open. They told a great story with Kurt just not giving up & eventually turning the tables on Austin to the point that Austin couldn't beat Kurt Angle no matter what he did to him. The ending was a jip with Austin getting DQed for attacking the referees but that didn't ruin the match as this was not only the best Austin/Angle encounter but the match of the night.

WCW Champion Booker T vs The Rock. This didn't top the Austin/Angle match at all but it was still a great match between these two as they were actually working a much faster pace than they are accustomed to along with both men trying to use their finishing moves, which was actually the same move (Rock Bottom/Book End). With Shane McMahon getting involved from time to time that lead to the APA coming out to ringside with Bradshaw giving Shane a stiff clothesline from hell, this was a great main event that gave the fans what they wanted with The Rock returning & winning the WCW Title.

DVD extras include interviews from Sunday Night Heat & the Austin Appreciation Night from the following RAW that lead to Kurt Angle giving the Alliance a ""milk-bath"" with a milk truck.

Overall, this was one of the best events that occurred during the Invasion angle along with this being one of those SummerSlam cards that is solid from start to finish. Even though I felt Austin/Angle should have ended the show, that doesn't take away from an event that I highly recommend.",1185840000,,4552,4.520048602673147
1395691,4,B000055ZKE,"Intercontinental Champion Lance Storm vs. Edge - Lance Storm regards this as his best match during his WWE run and you could see why here.  These two put together a solid wrestling match and a very good opening match.

APA & Spike Dudley vs. Test & Dudley Boyz - Another good match here as everyone worked real well together in this good mix of brawling & wrestling.  This was probably one of the APA's best matches & the interfearence with Shane McMahon would play a role later.

WWF Lightheavyweight Champion Tajiri vs. WCW Crusierweight Champion X-Pac - This was a title vs. title match as these two put on the third solid bout for the night & the best match in the history of the Lightheavyweight Title.  The only problem was that this match could have gone on longer as it seemed like it was too short to really turn into something.

Chris Jericho vs. Rhyno - This was a storyline building up for over 2 months as Chris Jericho had never defeated Rhyno.  Stephanie was at ring but the match didn't revolve around her & was allowed to be something good.  It did get a little slow at times but it was never boring & another solid match overall.

Ladder Match: Hardcore Champion Jeff Hardy vs. Rob Van Dam - This didn't top their match at Invasion or live up the standards that the Hardyz set in ladder matches but it was still something to watch.  The only thing bad would be various blown spots as RVD tried to be innovative but the spots didn't go off as planned.  Good but sloppy at times.

Steel Cage Match: WCW Tag Team Champions Undertaker & Kane vs. WWF Tag Team Champions DDP & Kanyon - The Undertaker fued with DDP reaches it's climax & ends the same way it started & remained throughout the entire storying...with DDP getting completely destroyed.  WCW was made to look completely inferior here as Undertaker & Kane just beat up DDP & Kanyon who didn't get any offense in before they let Kanyon go so they could double team DDP & beat the living hell out of him.  Anyone who payed attention to this fued knew how this one was going to end & play out.  It's good if you are just a fan of glorified squashes but otherwise, it's nothing to watch as the whole match (and fued) was one-sided.

WWF Champion Stone Cold vs. Kurt Angle - This is a forgotten classic here as they told a great story of Austin being completely ruthless here & Angle was the hero that never gave up.  They went on for around 30 mins. & the match turned from Angle had to beat Austin to Austin could not beat Kurt Angle.  They ending involving the referees was kinda a jip but it didn't take away from the match itself as it was the match of the night & again, a forgotten classic encounter.

WCW Champion Booker T vs. The Rock - This match didn't come close to topping the previous one but it was a good choice to close the show.  The people's champion of the WWF meets the guy alot of people concidered the people's champion of WCW...who both just happened to have the same finishing move in the Rock Bottom/Book End.  These two had a fast paced match that had some entertaining moments including one where the APA come out & get revenge on Shane McMahon by giving him one of the stiffest lariats I've seen from Bradshaw.  This gave the fans what they wanted as The Rock returned to PPV & became the WCW Champion.

Overall, this along with Rebellion & Survivor Series were the best PPV's during the whole Invasion period of the WWF.  Every match here was solid (except the cage match) this DVD is worth the price.  I recommend.",1181001600,,3513,4.3842592592592595

WWF Intercontinental Championship

Lance Storm (c) vs. Edge

I rarely enjoy the opening matches of wwe pay per views because nine times out of ten they are pretty boring. Although this match was fast paced and solid that quickly grasped my attention. Edge and Storm matched up really well with each other a lot of great manoeuvres displayed by both of them making it really hard to determine the victor. Christian's interference did not discredit the match at all I though it placed more excitement into it making Edge's victory more greatly deserved. 8.5/10

Spike Dudley & the APA vs. Test & the Dudley Boyz

A brutal and solid six man tag team match resulting in Spike being brutally double teamed throughout the match. APA did their best although Shane O Mac comes to Test's aid and saves the day for the alliance. Good Match 6.5/10

Light-Heavyweight championship vs. Crusierweight Championship

X-Pac vs. Tajiri

A great high flying match between these two in which I did not expect. X-pac to me is an average wrestler although here in this match he really impressed me with picking up the win. 8/10

Rhyno vs. Chris Jericho

A very solid match between these two that was better than expected. Rhyno gores Jericho as he was flying in mid-air on the outside. Steph gets lip-locked off the apron that leads to Rhyno tapping the walls of Jericho. 7.5/10

WWF Hardcore Title Ladder Match

Rob Van Dam vs. Jeff Hardy (c)

Two great hardcore competitors meet in the first ever ladder match for the WWF hardcore championship. Ladders were used in a variety of fashions such as Suplex of the ladder, power bombs of the ladder and leg drops on ladder etc. Fantastic match! in which where the crowd did not care who won because they are both fan favourites. 10/10

Cage Match for WWF tag team championships vs. WCW tag Team championships

Kane & Undertaker vs. DDP & Kanyon

Not a great technical match although a hell of an ass-kicking of a match. Undertaker & Kane dominated the entire match and then finally let Kanyon go and the two brothers beat the absolute crap out of DDP. A match to only see WCW gets the hell beaten out of them which is still entertaining enough. 7/10

WWF Championship Match

Kurt Angle vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin (c)

This wasn't a wrestling match it was more like a street fight. Angle gets all bloody from getting thrown into the ring post about 8 times. Austin receives a couple of suplexes on the floor and Angle gets about 4 stunners throughout the match and still kicks out. Also about four referees get taken out by Austin and then finally he gets dq by WCW ref who gets the ankle lock by Angle. 10/10 One of Stone cold's best match and Austin does not get angle slammed off the top rope which some reviewer said in their review before.

WCW Championship Match

The Rock vs. Booker T (c)

Great match between Booker T and the Rock in which where we see the Rock bottom vs. the bookend. Shane O Mac appears gets clotheslined by Bradshaw and then rockbottomed on the floor by The Rock. I love the ending where Booker T had everything going for him and then suddenly ROCKBOTTEM!!!! Great match although Austin vs. Angle should've been the main event. 9/10

1. WCW Tag Team Championship

 Hardy Boyz vs. Hurricane Helms and Lance Storm

No Mercy kicked off from the Savvis Center in St. Louis with WCW Tag Team Championship action, as the Hardy Boyz defended against The Hurricane and Lance Storm. The Hardys were accompanied to the ring by Lita, while Hurricane & Storm were accompanied by Mighty Molly and Ivory. Hurricane showed off some of his Hurri-powers as the match began, but the Hardys battled right back with their high-flying, double-teaming tactics. But Hurricane & Storm roared right back with some double-team tactics of their own. Soon Hurricane put on his cape and leapt from the top rope all the way to the outside, taking out his opposition! The challengers isolated Jeff Hardy, but Jeff soon battled back, nailing Lance with a breath-taking corkscrew moonsault. Moments later, he tagged Matt, who cleaned house. Soon it was an all-out brawl in the ring, with several near falls. Matt went for the Twist of Fate, and the challengers hit a double thrust kick, but Jeff saved his brother from the pin at the last second. Lita got involved soon after, getting into it with Ivory and Mighty Molly. Jeff then hit Ivory, and Lance Storm snuck up on Jeff to get the half Crab. But Lita hit Lance with a hurricanrana. Matt then hit a Twist of Fate on Hurricane, and Jeff hit the Swanton Bomb for the win!

Winners and still Champions: Hardy Boyz

2. Kane vs Test

Two of the biggest, baddest dudes in sports entertainment went at it when Test battled Kane. The match marked Kane's fourth anniversary in the Federation, as he made his debut at the October 1997 ""Badd Blood"" Pay-Per-View, right in St. Louis! Test went for his flying elbow, but Kane moved just in time and came back with a neckbreaker. Kane then drove Test down with a suplex, but Test just got the shoulder up at the last minute. A Kane clothesline sent Test over the top rope, but Test recovered to ram Kane into the ring post and hit him with a big boot to the face! Once back in the ring, Kane narrowly escaped defeat. Test measured for another boot to the face, but Kane caught him in a chokeslam! The two then traded blows until Kane caught Test in a powerslam. Kane then ascended the top rope but missed a flying clothesline! Amazingly, Test caught the 300-plus pound Kane in a pump-handle slam, but Test again narrowly avoided defeat! Test then went to the outside to grab a chair, but Kane hit a dropkick against the chair and into Test's face! When Kane went to use the chair, referee Nick Patrick grabbed the chair and took it away! Patrick's interference opened the door for Test to finish the Big Red Machine with a big boot to pick up the win! After the match, an angry Kane chokeslammed Patrick not once, but twice, and then sent Patrick down with a powerbomb!

Winner: Test

3. First Ever Lingerie Match

 Torrie Wilson vs. Stacy Keibler

The two sultry divas strutted down to the ring, ready to show off their stuff. Torrie unveiled her lingerie first, a mouth-watering red number. Stacy was slower to disrobe, instead stunning the crowd with some spins and kicks. Stacy then took off her robe to reveal a stunning black number, before slapping Torrie across the face. She then took out a whip, and whipped both Torrie and the referee! From there, the catfight was on, and the two women even rolled right over the ref! The women traded several near falls and then Torrie hit Tajiri's handspring elbow to score the pin, spanking Stacy after the bout!

Winner: Torrie Wilson

4. Intercontinental Championship Ladder Match

 Christian vs. Edge

Two years after Edge & Christian battled the Hardy Boyz in the Ladder Match that put both teams on the map, E&C met up one-on-one in a Ladder Match for Christian's Intercontinental Championship, as it was brother vs. brother! With the title hanging above the ring, the fight started on the ramp way. It didn't take long for the ladder to become a factor, and the two brothers even battled into the crowd. Edge took the early advantage, catapulting his brother into the ladder, but Christian battled back, dropping his brother onto it. With the ladder propped up between the ring and the barricade, the brothers battled it out on top, and Christian fell crotch-first onto one of the rungs! Edge tried to bring the battle into the ring, but a Christian dropkick knocked the ladder right into Edge's face! That allowed the IC Champion to set up the ladder and try and get his belt. But Edge knocked him from the ladder, and Christian clotheslined Edge in the process. Christian then trapped Edge in the corner with the ladder, as the ""Christian sucks!"" chants began. Christian got a steel chair and went to nail his brother, but Edge caught his brother and tossed him from the top rope onto the ladder, spine-first! Edge set the ladder up against the ropes and put his brother on his shoulders. He then tossed him off, and Christian landed on the ladder in a precarious position! Edge set up the ladder between the top two turnbuckles, but Christian reversed a whip, sending his brother into the ladder! Moments later, Christian slingshotted his brother right into the ladder! Christian brought another ladder into the ring and set it up, as Edge started to come to. Edge then set up the other ladder and slammed Christian from the top of both ladders, with both men putting their bodies on the line! Edge was the first to come to, and he ascended one of the ladders as the fans cheered for him. Christian attacked his brother from behind, and hit the I'm Prettier from the top of the ladder! Christian went to the outside and got a pair of steel chairs. He set his brother up for the one-man con-chair-to, but Edge knocked the chair back into Christian's face. Edge then went outside the ring and brought in a third ladder, propping it up on the two chairs. He set Christian up on the ladder, and then went to the top rope and splashed his brother with a thunderous crash! Edge started to climb for the title, but Christian used a ladder to the ribs to knock Edge from the ladder. Christian then propped up the third ladder behind the other two. Christian started climbing a ladder, and Edge went up to the top rope and speared Christian right off the ladder! The brothers then began to climb the same ladder at the same time, and as they ducked it out, their ladder fell to the outside of the ring, knocking both brothers to the floor! E&C were very slow in getting to their feet, and Christian got back into the ring first. He started to climb, but fell a few times, and he was clearly very sore. Soon Edge was back in the ring, and he hit Christian with a chair below the belt. Edge then manoeuvred the chairs and gave Christian a con-chair-to on the top of the ladders! Christian's prone body rolled off the ladders, as Edge grabbed the title and became the new Intercontinental Champion!

Winner and new Champion: Edge

 Dudley Boyz vs. Big Show and Tajiri

After putting Torrie Wilson and Spike Dudley through tables, the Dudley Boyz were wanted men in their title defence against Big Show and Tajiri. The Dudleys tried to isolate the Show, but the big man used his power advantage to gain control. Tajiri used his kicks in an attempt to score the Tag Titles, but Bubba soon nailed Tajiri with a Bubba Bomb. The Dudleys tried double-teaming Tajiri to soften up the smaller member of their challengers. Finally, Tajiri got the tag to Big Show, who dominated the Dudleys. The Show did his best Razor Ramon impression, and then signalled for the chokeslam, but the Dudleys knocked him out of the ring. Tajiri knocked the Dudleys down with kicks, and soon locked D-Von in the Tarantula. Moments later, he knocked the Dudleys down with a double handspring elbow! Tajiri went to hit Bubba with the mist, but instead hit the ref. Big Show then chokeslammed Bubba, but the ref was still out of it. Rhyno then ran to the ring and gored the Big Show to the outside. Tajiri then scored an enziguiri and a big kick to the face on D-Von, who barely kicked out of the pinfall. Moments later, the Dudleys hit the 3-D, and pinned Tajiri for the successful title defence.

Winners and still champions: Dudley Boyz

6. Undertaker vs. Booker T.

The most respected superstar in World Wrestling Federation history battled the most decorated superstar in WCW history as the Undertaker took on Booker T. The match started outside the ring with punches and kicks, as the two icons went at it. Taker went to work on Booker's left arm, and soon went old-school on Booker. Booker soon regained the advantage, as the fight spilled to the outside. Booker tried to hit Taker with the ring bell, but referee Tim White stopped him from doing so, and Taker regained the advantage as the fight spilled into the crowd. But Booker battled back as the fight went back into the ring. Booker went up top and nailed Taker with a missile dropkick. Soon after, he hit Taker with a big kick to the face, and a side suplex. Booker then telegraphed a knee to the face, and was about to go for the Spinerooni, until Taker got back to his feet. Taker rallied back with a big boot, but Booker reversed a powerslam and scored a near fall. Booker went to the second rope but was met with a big foot, and the two men slugged it out. A spinning heel kick by Booker was good for two, but Taker hit a DDT soon after. The fight continued, and Taker measured Booker for an avalanche. But Booker caught him, dropped him on the turnbuckle, and hit a kick, knocking Taker to the outside. Booker then hit the Spinerooni! As Taker went to get back in the ring, Booker hit him with a scissors kick, but Taker got his foot on the bottom rope. Moments later, Taker went for the chokeslam, but Booker powered out of it with a low blow, undetected by the ref. Booker punched Taker on the turnbuckles, but Taker nailed Booker with the Last Ride and pinned him to win the match.

Winner: Undertaker

7. WCW Heavyweight Championship

 The Rock vs. Chris Jericho

It was the biggest match of Chris Jericho's career, as Y2J challenged The Rock for the WCW Championship, looking to prove that he could indeed win the ""big match."" Rock -- who lost the Federation Championship last year at No Mercy -- was looking to defeat his motivated challenger. The two popular superstars laid into each other from the get-go, as the fans were clearly split in who to cheer for. Rock looked for the Rock Bottom early on, but Y2J powered out and went for the Walls of Jericho, but Rocky got to the ropes. Y2J then hit Rock with the second-rope dropkick, pulling out all the stops for this unique opportunity to snare WCW gold. He also hit Rock with a top-rope reverse elbow for a two-count. Y2J also scored a near-fall after a flying forearm. Y2J gained the advantage, and assaulted Rock with various manoeuvres, trying to wear down the People's Champion. Rock roared back with a clothesline, but Jericho hung Rock out to dry on the top rope moments later. After a bodyslam, Jericho went up top, but Rock caught him and crotched him on the top rope, and then superplexed him down! The men slugged it out, and Rock tossed Jericho down, and then nailed Y2J with a Samoan drop for a two-count. Running on adrenaline, Rock knocked Jericho over the top rope to the outside. On the outside, he knocked Y2J's head off the announce table, before tossing him back into the ring. Rocky continued to pound on The Rock, but Jericho battled back. Rock floored Y2J with a clothesline, but Jericho kicked out of the pin. Moments later, Rock tossed Jericho to the outside. Back on the inside, Rock scored another near-fall. Rock then tried to wear down Y2J with a sleeper. After battling out of the sleeper, Y2J went for a dropkick but missed. Rock hit Jericho with a slingshot into the top turnbuckle, and then hit a clothesline. Rock continued to dominate, and went for another top-rope superplex. But Jericho pushed Rock down, and hit Rock with a missile dropkick! Both men were slow to get back to their feet, and when they did, they slugged it out. Y2J scored with a neckbreaker and a hurricanrana for two. Moments later, Jericho hit Rock with a Rock Bottom! He then nailed a Lionsault, but Rock kicked out at two, much to Y2J's shock! Y2J then hit a bulldog on The Rock, and went for the People's Elbow, but Rock moved! Rock battled back, putting Y2J in the sharpshooter! Jericho screamed for dear life, and after what seemed like minutes, Y2J finally made it to the ropes, forcing Rock to break the hold! On the outside, Rock took the top off the Spanish announce table, and he and Jericho ascended the table. He then nailed Y2J with a Rock Bottom right through the table! Rock stared down his challenger, and brought him back into the ring. He set Y2J up for a Rock Bottom, but Jericho battled out of it. Rock then hit a spinebuster on Y2J, and went for a People's Elbow of his own. But as he was about to hit it, Jericho caught Rock's foot, and locked Rock in the Walls of Jericho! Rock reached for the ropes for all he was worth, but as he was about to get there, Jericho pulled him away! Suddenly, Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley ran to the ring and threw a chair in the ring, Y2J let go of the hold to knock Stephanie from the apron, and when Y2J turned around, Rock nailed him with a DDT. Rock then threw Stephanie into the ring, and hit her with a Rock Bottom! The distracted ref didn't see Y2J knock Rock's head into the chair! Three seconds later, Chris Jericho was the new WCW Champion! After the bout, Y2J mocked Stephanie. Rock grabbed a chair and snuck up behind Y2J. When Jericho turned around, Rock presented him with the chair, and Jericho held up the title belt and the chair!

Winner and new Champion: Chris Jericho

8. WWF Heavyweight Championship

Steve Austin vs. Kurt Angle vs. Rob Van Dam

This match was made all-the-more interesting by the fact that Commissioner Mick Foley made it a no-disqualification bout on HEAT, and also by the fact that there were many question as to what role Vince McMahon would play. Austin had some words for RVD prior to the bout, as Angle snuck up and nailed both men with suplexes. Austin & RVD soon battled back and double-teamed the Olympian. They knocked him from the ring, and Austin talked some trash to RVD, even giving him the middle finger. RVD gave it right back, as Angle snuck up behind RVD and attacked him. The Rattlesnake pounded on both men, even hitting Angle with a low blow. He went for the Stunner on Angle, who reversed it into an ankle lock before RVD kicked Angle, breaking the hold. RVD nailed Austin with a series of kicks, before Angle attacked RVD from behind. But RVD hit Angle with Rolling Thunder for a near-fall, broken up by Austin. As the ""RVD"" chants heated up, Austin hit RVD with a spinebuster, threw Angle to the outside, and gained a near-fall on RVD. Austin went to work on RVD's knees, and also pounded on Kurt. Stone Cold locked RVD in a half Boston Crab, until Angle broke it up. Austin threw Angle to the outside and locked RVD in a STF, until Angle broke that up too. Outside the ring, Austin slingshotted Angle into the ringpost, and then wrapped RVD's legs on the ringpost. With Angle and Austin down, RVD went up top. He went for the Five-Star Frog Splash, but both men moved out of the way. Moments later, Austin hit the Stunner on Angle, but RVD broke up the pin. RVD set Austin up in the corner, and hit the split-legged moonsault for two. Angle hit the Angle slam on RVD, but Austin broke up the pin. Austin knocked Angle from the ring, and then Stone Cold went outside the ring after him. Austin and Angle ducked it out on the outside, and Stone Cold took the top off the other announce table. He went to piledrive Angle, but Angle backdropped him onto the announce table, which did not break! RVD then scored with a leap to the outside on Angle, as all three men lay on the outside! Suddenly, Vince McMahon strutted to ringside. RVD & Angle were the first two men up, and they slugged it out inside the ring, where RVD hit Angle with a reverse heel kick. RVD then went up top, but Angle caught him with a top-rope belly-to-belly suplex! Austin finally got back into the ring, and hit another Stunner on Angle, but Angle fell outside the ring, so the Rattlesnake turned his attention to RVD. Mr. McMahon then got in the ring and nailed Austin in the back with a steel chair! RVD went up top and nailed Austin with the Five-Star Frog Splash, but an injured RVD couldn't go for the pin right away. When he finally did, Angle broke it up. Angle hit RVD with four belly-to-back suplexes and an Angle slam, but as he went for the pin, Shane McMahon ran down and threw Angle to the outside and into the ringpost! Shane and Vince then started going at it! Back in the ring, Austin hit the Stunner on RVD and pinned him to retain his championship, much to Vince McMahon's shock!

Intercontinental championship match, Lance Storm vs Edge: This was a good opener, both men show they have chemistry together. I liked it when they had good wrestling even in the opening matches. Edge wins. 8.5/10

Spike Dudley and the APA vs. Test and the Dudley Boyz: Nice six man tag team match. Spike even goes through a table on the outside. Shane McMahon makes an appearance with a steel chair on Bradshaw. WCW guys win. Good match and I miss the APA. 8/10

Rhyno vs. Chris Jericho: Great match between these two. Rhyno gores Jericho on the outside. Jericho was really great back then and Rhyno wasn't too bad either. Rhyno taps out to the Walls of Jericho! 8/10

WWF tag team championships vs. WCW tag Team championships
Kane and Undertaker vs. DDP and Kanyon, cage match: Its rumored that Kane and Undertaker will team up again against the two new weirdos at WM 21. Not that great of a cage match, but the WCW guys really get the crap kicked out of them. As you can tell, the WWF guys won. 7/10

WWf Hardcore Ladder Match, Rob Van Dam vs. Jeff Hardy: Two similar daredevils meet in a match of the year candidate of 2001. Ladders were climbed, and Jeff powerbombed RVD off the ladder! Great Match! 10/10 [Rvd's new DVd has the match with him vs. Jeff one month earlier than this ppv at Invasion. That was great too.

Light-Heavyweight championship vs. Crusierweight Championship
Tajiri vs. X-Pac: Nice high flying match between these two. I am not a very big fan of X-Pac, but even he managed to keep me interested in this match. X-Pac wins to unify the championships. 8/10

WCW Championship Match - The Rock vs. Booker T: Great Match, the Book end meets the Rock bottom. Shane McMahon and Bradshaw both make appearances in this match as well. Rock wins with the Rock bottom. 9/10

WWf championship match
Stone Cold vs. Kurt Angle: At WM 21 it is rumored that Kurt will face HBK, plus Stone Cold is expected to return then too. As for the match, wow, great match. Angle gets all bloody and Stone cold gets angle-slammed off the top rope.

At least 4 referees were taken out by Angle or Austin, and Angle even gave the Ankle-lock to a WCW referee after the match. Austin wins after getting DQ'd and keeps his title. 10/10

Great ppv, such a shame to see just how far WWE has fallen where it once used to be. By the way, it is really hard to find this on DVd, it was for me.",1107993600,,2650,4.456611570247934

Lance Storm (Chaampion) V. Edge
When you have two Canadian wrestlers in the ring at the same time, you are probably going to get a great match and this one was. Awesome, Storm's greatest WWF match and it was a lose. Edge wins the Intercontinental Title. ****

This match was good, but it wasn't great. The Dudleyz & Test win. **

X-Pac (WCW Cruiserweight Champion) V. Tajiri (WWF Lightheavyweight Champion)

Good match but, again, could have been better with Jericho winning. **1/2

Good Ladder Match with some great spots. Alot better than the Ladder Match Edge & Christian will have two months later at No Mercy. RVD wins back the Hardcore Championship. ***1/2

Steel Cage Match for the WWF & WCW Tag Team Championships:
DDP & Kanyon (WWF Tag Team Champions) V. The Undertaker & Kane (WCW Tag Team Champions)
Good match. Good thing it was inside a Cage because it would have been worst if it was just a normal match. Taker & Kane win the WWF Tag Team Championship. **3/4

WWF Championship:
Stone Cold Steve Austin (Champion) V. Kurt Angle
Awesome, Awesome match. By far, the match of the night, and maybe, match of the year? Nope, that honor went to the TLC Match at WrestleMania (should have been Angle/Benoit's Ultimate Submission match at Backlash). Angle wins! by DQ (damn). ****1/2

Booker T. (Champion) V. The Rock
Why is the WCW Championship the main event at an WWF event? Oh well. Good match and it could have been better. The Rock had a little ring rust, but he wins the WCW Championship. ***

1395733,5,B000055ZKE,"Great PPV put together by the WWF.  This PPV occurred about two months into the fued between the WWF and the Alliance.

1. Edge vs. Lance Storm (Intercontinental Title)

What a way to kick of the show.  These two went at it from the get go.  The action is very fast paced from the beginning right up to the very end.  Many close falls in the match.  It is too bad Lance Storm never got the respect he deserved in the WWE.  (9/10)

2. Spike Dudley & APA vs. Tazz & The Dudley's

Another very exciting match.  Spike takes a couple of nasty bumps in this match.  Surprsing appearance from Shane McMahon.  (8/10)

3. X-Pac vs. Tajiri (WWF Lightweight Title & WCW Cruiserweight Title)

Good match between two top notch cruiserweights.  There are currently many rumors that X-Pac may return to the WWE.  Entertaining match.  (8.5/10)

4. Chris Jericho vs. Rhyno w/Stephanie McMahon

Decent match.  It was not as good as I thought it would be.  The two put on a good show nonetheless.  Good beef between Jericho and Stephanie.  (7.5/10)

5. Jeff Hardy vs. Rob Van Dam (WWF Hardcore Title/Ladder Match)

Wow!! Great match.  This was at the time when the fans were cheering for both of these guys even thought RVD was in the Alliance.  It is too bad Hardy is not in the WWE and RVD doesn't get put in better storylines.  Great match.  The two competitors were very innovative in the use of the ladders.  The second best match of the night.  (9.5/10)

6. Undertaker & Kane vs. DDP & Kanyon (WWF & WCW Tag Titles/Cage Match)

Very disappointing match.  I was expecting a lot more.  Basically it was a set up to get DDP inside the cage alone with Kane and Taker.  (6/10)

7. Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Kurt Angle (WWF Title)

Unbelievable match.  These two put their hearts into this match.  Very emotional match.  You almost feel like you are there.  Great match, but be aware:  terrible ending.  It may have been best match of the year if not for the ending.  I would have given it a 10 if the ending was better.  (9.5/10)

8. The Rock vs. Booker T (WCW Championship)

This was The Rock's return to WWF PPV's.  These two had good beef going into this match, but the wrestling quality wasn't that great for a Summerslam main event.  Good presence by Shane McMahon.  Surprise appearance by the APA.  (7.5/10)

I definately recommend picking up this DVD.  Very exciting PPV.  Get this for the ladder match and Austin/Angle match.

While those were the two best shows of the year, Summerslam was definately not far behind. With the acception of one match, the entire card was enjoyable. The IC Title match between Edge and Lance Storm was very technically sound and suspenseful. The Cruiserweight Title match between X-Pac and Tajiri was fast paced and filled with non-stop action. Rhyno vs Jericho was one of the best matches on the card. The highlight of the match was seeing Jericho jump off the top rope and get gored in mid-air by Rhyno. RVD and Jeff Hardy were amazing in their Hardcore title ""Ladder Match"". It is filled with tons of fast paced high flying action combined with some brutal bumps. The Rock vs Booker T for the WCW Title was very suspenseful and fun to watch. The match that stole the show was Kurt Angle vs Austin for the WWE title. It had to be one of the best matches I have ever seen. It went back and forth until the very end. The ending is highly controversial and upsetting, which is the only downfall of the match.
Overall, Summerslam 2001 is one of the best WWE shows I have ever seen in the ten years that I have been watching wrestling.

Not a bad match...leads into the Edge/Christian feud nicely. The Dudley Boyz and Test defeat APA and Spike Deudley in a surprisingly good 6-man tag-team match. Shane McMahon's interference and Spike Dudley going through a table are high points in this contest. In a Cruiserweight-Light Heavyweight Championship-for-Championship match, X-Pac defeats Tajiri to leave with both belts. A pretty ordinary match, but not bad seeing that the cruiserweight division was really just being utilized at ppv. Rhyno and Chris Jericho was an entertaining rivalry and the match was decent as well. Stephanie McMahon's involvement added fuel to her feud with Y2J. Jeff Hardy and Rob Van Dam didn't top their Hardcore Title match from Invasion, but they did put on a show in the First-Ever Hardcore Ladder match. Undertaker and Kane vs. DDP and Kanyon was a dull steel cage match with both companies tag-titles on the line. It was really just a means of ending the long-running DDP/Taker feud.

1395751,3,B000055ZKE,"SUMMERSLAM 2001. LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR!!!!
THIS WAS NOT A BAD WWE PAY-PER-VIEW BY ANY MEANS. IT WAS COOL AND EVERYTHING BUT SHOULD'VE FEATURED BETTER HARDCORE ACTION.

  THE LADDER MATCH BETWEEN ROB VAN DAM AND JEFF HARDY WAS COOL. IT HAD SOME PRETTY TIGHT MOVES AND SOME NASTY BUMPS. THE T.L.C. MATCHES WERE STILL A HECK OF A LOT BETTER THOUGH.
  THE STEEL CAGE MATCH - UNDERTAKER & KANE VS. DDP & KANYON - WAS A FAIR MATCH BUT SORT OF STUNK. IT COULD'VE BEEN A HECK OF A LOT BETTER THAN WHAT IT WAS. UNDERTAKER TOOK IT TOO EASY ON DDP (DIAMOND DALLAS PAGE). THE MATCH NEEDED MORE BLOOD & GUTS, DAG NABBIT!!!
  KURT ANGLE TOOK ON STONE COLD STEVE AUSTIN FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP. AUSTIN & ANGLE STOLE THE SHOW AS KURT RECIEVED A BRUTAL BEATING FROM THE ""RATTLESNAKE"" AND CAME BACK FOR MORE! AUSTIN RAMS KURT ANGLE'S HEAD INTO THE STEEL RING POST NUMEROUS TIMES. KURT ANGLE GETS REALLY BUSTED OPEN. NOT FOR THE WEAK OF STOMACH. THE ONLY HUGE LETDOWN IS THE CONCLUSION OF THIS MATCHUP, AS ANGLE IS CHEATED BY EVIL REFEREE NICK PATRICK.
THE ROCK TOOK ON BOOKER T IN A PRETTY COOL WCW CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH. THE COOLEST PART OF THIS MATCH IS WHEN THE A.P.A. COMES OUT AND BRADSHAW CLOTHESLINES THE LIVING HECK OUT OF SHANE MCMAHON!!! I THOUGHT SHANE MIGHT'VE BEEN PARILYZED FOLLOWING THE ATTACK!!! THE ROCK FINALLY FIRES BACK WITH A ROKBOTTOM ON BOOKER T AND WINS THE MATCH AND THE WCW TITLE.
GOOD PPV.",1035417600,,1403,4.45703125
1395752,5,B000055ZKE,"This was the best PPV since WM17 when The Rock was suspended by Vince. There is no doubt that he was ready to return. My favorite match is BookerT/Rock cause it had everyone in the back watching to see who would win the WCW title. I enjoyed the other matches especially Austin/Angle cause everyone was watching that one as well. I recommend this to any hardcore WWE fan out there. Every PPV out on video/DVD I recommend as well. No one puts on a PPV like the WWE. Believe me, you will not be disappointed.",1035158400,,505,4.326315789473684
1395753,4,B000055ZKE,"Summerslam has been well known for being an outstanding event with quality matches and storylines. This one is no different. This PPV is right in the middle of the WWE/Alliance feud and is host to a double main event with Stone Cold defending his WWE Heavyweight Championship against rising star Kurt Angle in a killer battle, and The Rock tries to win WCW gold on defending champion Booker T in a suspense filled brawl. There is lots of good stuff on the undercard too, making the event worth the time and bother. I will run through the matches and rate each one out of five (...):
WWE Intercontinental Championship - Lance Storm vs. Edge: A blinding battle as Edge and Lance Storm do a great job of pumping up the crowd in a high energy opener. Excellent grappling and fast paced false finishes call for a brilliant brawl between two of the finest wrestlers in the WWE today. ...
Test and the Dudley Boyz vs. The APA and Spike Dudley (with Molly Holly): Decent enough outing, that exceeds most peoples expections. Some good action throughout and some nice spots leading up to the finish. What was not so hot was the screwjob finish though. **1/2
WWE Light Heavy Weight and WCW Cruiserweight Championship Unification Match - X-Pac vs. Tajiri: Not bad at all with some nice kicks by both men. Lots of false finishes and good counters also. Very enjoyable battle, where not a classic, is still very good and solid throughout. ...1/4
Rhyno (with Stephanie McMahon) vs. Chris Jericho: Fair match, but is marred by lots of botched spots, as Jericho slips of the ropes several times. Still, some good action and lots of excitement lead up to a great ending, but this is somehwhat dissapointing with all the missed spots. ...P>WWE Hardcore Championship Ladder Match - Jeff Hardy vs. Rob Van Dam: Solid, if again not dissapointing clash between the two highflyers. Still a very good match by normal accounts though, as there are lots of rough ladder spots. Some missed spots aside however, another solid effort, with plenty of crowd participation. ***/3/4
WWE and WCW Tag Team Championship Unification Cage Match - The Undertaker and Kane vs. DDP and Kanyon: Awful match between the two teams, which thankfully ends a disturbing storyline. Sloppy and boring, this has the honour of worst match of the night. I did not enjoy it at all. *1/4
WWE Championship - Kurt Angle vs. Stone Cold: To sum it up in one word - fantastic. Compelling action and suspense all the way and they scorch up the heat in a blood filled brawl. Best match on the card by a wide margin, definately worth getting the tape just to see this. Good, good, good match. ****3/4
WCW Championship - The Rock vs. Booker T: Good stuff here, but this match was fairly short and did not really have much time to develop. Still, excellent effort by both men and another good match in a series tonight. Not a patch on the battle beforehand, but then again, that was a match of the year candidate. ****
Overall, a excellent event. It starts off hot with a scorching opener, and finishes with two fantastic outings. With a solid card in between, you have a near perfect event. It gets four stars, as opposed to five as there are a few minor glitches to be found, such as the cage match and the slip ups in the Rhyno/Jericho. But overall, one of the best Summerslams in recent history. If you want an event even better than this (which must mean its good) go and dig up Summerslam 2000, which gets the perfect score of five stars in my opinion. But this is without a doubt worth a look.

1395755,5,B000055ZKE,"The 2001 WWE summerslam was real good because the rock had retuned after being out of action for nearly 4 months. Here are all the matches and how they were....
#1 WWE Intercontinental Championship: Lance Storm vs Edge: Good opening match that got the crowd's attention. It was the perfect match to start the ppv event.
#2 Dudley Boyz & Test vs A.P.A. & Spike Dudley- Really great match. Spike Dudley proved that he may be small but he is tough. What I thought was pretty much exciting about their rivaly was that the A.P.A. wanting revenge on Test after he costed them the WWE Tag team Titles.
#3 WCW Cruiserwight/WWE Lightheavweight Championship: X-Pac vs Tajiri- Great perfomance between two lightheavywights although it was kind of wierd having 2 WWE superstars fighting each other when the Alliance was around.
#4 Y2J vs Rhyno (with Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley)- Awsome match because Y2J was putting all he can to beat Rhyno(Which is something he has never done)and Y2J also got to put a lip lock on Stephanie!!
#5 WWE Hordcore Championship Ladder Match: Jeff Hardy vs RVD- Proved to be a worthy rematch from INVASION and it is one of the greatest ladder matches I've ever seen. These two superstars proved to be hardcore!
#6 WWE/WCW Tag Team Championship Steel Cage Match: Undertaker & Kane (With Sara)vs DDP and Kanyon- This is one of my favorite tag teams championship matches, considering the fact that there were titles garranteed to change hands and this time there was no way for DDP to away the Undertaker. This time Undertaker was able to do anything he wanted to DDP and there was nothing that DDP could do about it because he is surrounded by steel.
#7 WWE Championship: Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Kurt Angle- The best match where I've seen Kurt Angle in. In this match he definetly used his 3 I's (Integretty, Intensety, Intelligence)It was great to see Kurt withstand 3 stunners and put forth all he can to bring the WWE title back to the WWE. The only thing dissapointing was the end of the match.
#8 WCW Championship: Booker T vs The Rock- The Rock had his eye on beating up Austin but Booker T decided to go in his way which led up to this match. The match was great, lots of good moves were used, Rock withstanded interfearence, and the WWE was counting on Rock to win this match. The end of the match was great and made up for the ending of the WWE Championship.

Stone Cold vs. Angle- This was a great match. Good chemistry between the two.  Weak ending hurts, but not too much.

Edge vs. Lance Storm- Good technical action. Enjoyable, from two good wrestlers. Storyline development is there and the match is fun to watch, and really picks up as you go along.
Spike and the APA vs. Test and The Dudley Boyz- Okay for a six man, but nothing special. A very unimportant match, subpar but not terrible.
Tajiri vs. X-Pac- I loved this match. It was very entertaining with great in ring action. Very enjoyable and watchable, definitley the sleeper of the card.
Rhyno vs. Jericho- This was okay, but I was expecting alot, and with the sloppy missed spots and below average working from both competitors I found it dissapointing. A good match, but it should have been great.
DDP and Kanyon vs. The Undertaker and Kane- TERRIBLE. I mean this is painful to watch. It is a sqaush cage match with wrestlers who don't work well together. Brutal.
RVD and Jeff Hardy- Great showstealer. Amazing spots, but missed spots make it seem sloppy (I hear that there were problems with the ropes), and stop it from being classic. Very good match though.
Booker T vs. The Rock- Even though I was excited for his return, I must admit that I was reminded why I was never a huge Rock fan. Very average. Good, but not great. Rock matches all seem the same to me.
Stone Cold vs. Angle- This was a great match. Good technichal action, very suspensful. Bloody. I wish the ending hadn't been so weak, but still a great match.

The DQ finish of the Austin-Angle WWF title match was a bit of a downer but it makes sense within the storylines.

The 2001 SummerSlam kicks off with this impressive opening bout from 2 of the greatest wrestlers to come from Canada. Drawing down to the final minutes, Edge manages to reverse a half boston crab from Storm into his own. Storm manages to escape it, accidentally knocking the referee over for a couple seconds in the process. Christian runs down and tries to Spear Storm, but he accidentally ends up Spearing Edge instead, continuing to plant the seeds of the forthcoming Edge vs Christian feud. Christian gets taken out with a superkick from Storm right as the referee gets to his feet. Storm makes the pin but Edge unbelievably gets his shoulder up right at the close 2. In the end, Edge counters Storm's offense with an Edgecution for the win. After the match, Christian enters the ring and stares intently at the Intercontinental Championship and looks as if he's going to hit Edge with it, while his back was turned, really teasing Christian's heel turn. Instead he just hands the title over to Edge, gives a sarcastic hug and walks off to the back. This would mark the last PPV, Edge and Christian appeared at as a tag team, as they'd split just 2 weeks later. And while Lance Storm had the personality of a blank wall, he was a tremendous wrestler and this was a good opening bout

Michael Cole catches up with Test and The Dudley Boyz backstage and asks Test why he turned his back on the WWF. Test snatches the microphone from Cole and says the WWF turned their backs on him. Test says he marched with WWF when The Rock was coming back and got rewarded with a beating from The Alliance. Test puts over The Dudley Boyz as being the greatest tag team in wrestling and cements his loyalty with the Alliance

Elsewhere, Lillian Garcia gets Chris Jericho's thoughts on his match with Rhyno. Jericho says he's never tamed Rhyno and makes jokes about Stephanie McMahon sleeping around with everyone from the football team to the swimming team to French Club and the AV Squad! Jericho ends his promo saying he's going to leave Rhyno flat

2.) Spike Dudley w/Molly Holly and APA vs The Dudley Boyz and Test

Solid bout for the most part. The final moments of the match become chaotic and exciting with action happening all over the place. At one point Spike goes for the Dudley Dog on Test, but Test counters and throws Spike to the outside, through a table that the Dudleyz had set up at ringside. Bradshaw flattens Test with the Clothesline From Hell only to turn around and get attacked by Shane McMahon with his classic jumping steel chair shot. The referee never sees Shane as Shane O' Mac runs for the hills, re-enters the ring and Test pins Bradshaw for the win. Solid match with a chaotic final minutes in addition to a nice interference from Shane McMahon.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Edge is in the WWF locker room, being congratulated on his win by Al Snow, Hardcore Holly, Lita, and Matt Hardy when Christian walks in and awkwardly kills the mood by telling Edge Commissioner Regal gave him a European Championship match the next night on Raw against Matt Hardy--who was standing right in front of him. Suddenly, Christian gets a phone call from their grandma Edna who wants to talk to Edge. Christian hands over the phone to Edge who receives adulation from ""grams"" before giving the phone back to Christian, who wanted to talk to her, only to find out, she already hung up. Poor Christian. So underappreciated. All he wanted was to talk to his grandma! Hilarious segment!

Shawn Stasiak walks in Stone Cold and Debra's locker room, with only Debra in there, looking for Austin, admitting he failed at trying to impress Stone Cold as of late and blames it on his pink tights with black and white stars with Mecca printed on the back of them. Debra, annoyed at Stasiak's presence, tells him that Austin is busy preparing for his match against Angle. Debra advises Stasiak that the way to impress Austin is by kicking butt, causing Stasiak to reluctantly leave

3.) WCW Cruiserweight Championship vs WWF Light Heavyweight Championship Unification Match: Tajiri (c) vs X-Pac (c)

It was WCW's Cruiserweight championship and WWF's Light Heavyweight Championship up for grabs in this interesting match with the winner, earning both championships. This was a fast-paced, hot, back and forth accelerating match. X-Pac gets the advantage over Tajiri in the opening minutes but Tajiri fights back and the momentum constantly shifts between the 2 going forward. X-Pac's X-Factor buddy, Albert creeps to ringside to watch the match. Just as Tajiri looks to finish Pac off with a Buzzsaw Kick, Albert leaps up on the apron but Tajiri spits red mist in his eyes for his efforts. While the referee deals with Tajiri and Albert, X-Pac sneaks in a low blow on Tajiri and capitalizes with an X-Factor for the win to claim and unify both titles. Awesomely swift match from these 2. This marked the last time the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship was on TV as it went defunct shortly after this PPV

We go to WWF New York Times Square with Perry Saturn who is searching for Moppy, claiming it---or ""she"" was kidnapped. Saturn shows a milk carton with Moppy's face on the back of it, claiming he's been putting her face all over milk cartons. It was a shame to see what became of Saturn. The guy was really over in WCW and by 2001, they reduced Saturn to nothing more than a comedy act. Sickening.

We go backstage in Rhyno's locker room with Stephanie McMahon giving Rhyno a pep talk before his match with Chris Jericho. Rhyno promises to end Jericho once and for all

4.) Rhyno w/Stephanie McMahon vs Chris Jericho

With the Jericho/Stephanie feud at an all time high in the Summer of 2001, Stephanie hired Rhyno as a mercenary so to speak to eliminate Jericho from the WWF. The match starts with ordinary action from the 2 but the most notable moment comes with Jericho diving off the turnbuckle to the outside, only to get caught with a Gore in mid-air, earning some ""holy sh*t!"" chants from the crowd. Jericho had recently been Gored through the Smackdown Ovaltron set by Rhyno, so Rhyno worked over Y2J's abdomen for most of the match with bodyscissors, surfboard stretches, etc. Jericho starts to make a comeback and manages to get Rhyno down for the pin but just as he makes the cover, Stephanie distracts the referee. Jericho confronts Stephanie and the Billion Dollar Princess attempts to slap Y2J, but he grabs her hand and plants a kiss on her. After a few more counters and shifting momentum, Jericho blocks a Gore and gets Rhyno in the Walls of Jericho in the middle of the ring. With nowhere to go, Rhyno taps, giving Jericho the win. Stephanie throws a temper tantrum all the way to the back

Commissioner Regal finds The Rock backstage and asks him if he's sure he's 100% after Booker T's assault on the previous Smackdown. The Rock tells Regal he's hurt but he's here and all Booker T did was piss him off. He asks if Regal can smell it. Before Regal can answer, Shawn Stasiak appears out of nowhere, charging at The Rock, only to miss and knock himself out by running into a steel door. Priceless!

5.) WWF Hardcore Championship Ladder Match: RVD vs Jeff Hardy (c)

To follow up on their brutally fascinating Hardcore Match at Invasion, Jeff and RVD were at it again for the Hardcore Championship, this time in a Ladder Match, which was sure to be a stealer. This is one match I could watch over and over again. Jeff and RVD go above and beyond in this match, using the ladder not only as a weapon but as a prop to do some of the most craziest, breathtaking daredevil dives to entertain the crowd. To put it simple it was hardcore warfare from these 2. In the end, after an incredible showing from both men, RVD manages to retrieve the Hardcore Championship to win the title belt. Marvelous and underrated is all that can be said about this match

6.) WWF Tag Team Championship and WCW Tag Team Championship Steel Cage Match: Kanyon and DDP (c) vs Kane and The Undertaker (c) w/Sara

This marked the ugly end of the ugly Undertaker/DDP feud---at least on PPV it did. It'd truly end the next night on Raw but more on that in a second. It should be no secret that DDP was not liked by Undertaker or Vince McMahon during the Invasion storyline. But anyways, following DDP getting beat down by Undertaker at King of the Ring, the story continued with DDP continuing to stalk and harass Sara. Kanyon would eventually join in on the fun and with Kanyon and DDP and the Brothers of Destruction being Tag Team Champions, it was decided that they'd defend their titles in a Steel Cage Match at the PPV. Want to talk about a squash match; this was it. DDP and Kanyon got in a few shots, but for the most part, Kane and Taker tossed them around like garbage bags. After a 5 minute beating, they let Kanyon go and then destroyed DDP. Taker gets the win with the Last Ride and just like that DDP's credibility was destroyed. Here was one of WCW's top superstars and he was reduced to an afterthought. Now really, this should've been a good match but it ultimately turned out to be nothing more than a glorified squash match that marked the last stand of DDP and Kanyon's career in WWE. DDP would get humiliated and buried the next night on Raw by Sara in 6 SECONDS before disappearing from TV for the next 2 months, while Kanyon would go on to become a jobber for the rest of his career. It was a sad time for DDP in the Invasion

7.) WWF Championship Match: Kurt Angle vs Stone Cold Steve Austin (c)

After Stone Cold turned on the WWF at the Invasion PPV the previous month, the WWF needed a new hero to lead Team WWF and Kurt Angle stepped up to fill that position. Angle had become really over as a face during this time and was undoubtedly WWF's second top babyface behind The Rock. The match starts on the outside of the ring, as Austin and Angle brawl on the walkway. Stone Cold works over Austin for a good portion of the first half of the match and even hits the Stunner early but Angle kicks out. Austin hits it again but Angle falls to the outside of the ring. Austin follows after him and slams Angle's head into the ring post, busting him open and does it at least 3 or 4 more times. Austin continues to work over a bloody Angle in the ring. Angle gets the momentum for a brief second with the Ankle Lock, only for Austin to escape it and continue keeping the match in his favor.",1440028800,,11764,5.08609958506224

7931547,5,B000055ZKE,"This is my review on WWF Summerslam 2001. Summerslam 2001 took place at the HP Pavillion on August 19, 2001 in San Jose,CA. This was a really great Summerslam. At the time the WWF was feuding with the Alliance. During the previous pay-per view Invasion Steve Austin betrayed the WWF and joined the Alliance.

1) WWF Intercontinental Championship Edge vs Lance Storm
This was a really solid match from start to finish. Edge took control with a clothesline and other offensive moves. Then Storm took control of the match, but Edge came back with a powerbomb onto Storm. Storm later regained momentum with a one legged boston crab. Edge grabbed the ropes, but Christian who was Edge's partner came out and tried to take out Lance Storm but accidentally speared Edge. Despite that Edge got the win with an edgecution. Overall this was a great match and the right man got the win. 8.25/10

2) The Dudley Boyz and Test vs The APA and Spike Dudley
This was just a regular six man tag match. The match started with Spike trying to attack Bubba Ray Dudley, but he was quickly thrown down. Then Test and Spike fought it out with Test taking control. Test was ready to throw Spike into a table but Spike didn't let that happen. Eventually Spike was thrown into the table. The match ended when Shane McMahon interfered and hit Bradshaw with a steel chair. Overall a good match but could have been better. 7.5/10

3) WWF Lightheavyweight Champion Tajiri vs WCW Cruiserweight Champion X-Pac
This match was a title vs title match to see who was the better of the two companies. All I have to say is this was a really fast match and very entertaining for the little time it got. X-Pac got the win with an X-Factor to Tajiri. 8/10

4) Chris Jericho vs Rhyno
The story for this match was that Stephanie McMahon was trying to get rid of Chris Jericho so she picked Rhyno to take on Chris Jericho hoping to end him. The match starts off with some back and forth action between the two. Chris Jericho attempts the walls of jericho early in the match only for Rhyno to escape it. Then Jericho kicks Rhyno out of the ring. Jericho tries to jump on Rhyno but Stephanie distracts him, so when Jericho jumped he got Gored by Rhyno in an awesome spot. Then Rhyno ended up taking control with a submisson around Jericho's ribs. Rhyno attempts a suplex and then Jericho got up and tried to pin Rhyno then there was more back and forth action. Jericho gains momentum with a Lionsault, but gets the two count. Then Rhyno performs a spinebuster on Jericho and then his own walls of jericho. Jericho escapes but Rhyno attempts a Gore but it was reversed into the walls of jericho. In the end Jericho made Rhyno submit. Overall a really great match. 8.5/10

5)WWF Hardcore Championship Ladder Match Jeff Hardy vs Rob Van Dam
This was a really great match and both of these men put on quite a show. This was a spot fest and a very good one too. At first the match starts off with regular wrestling. It goes on for like 2 minutes until Jeff Hardy takes Rob out of the ring and performed a springboard corkscrew onto RVD outside the ring. The two battle outside until RVD takes back control when he kicked Hardy while he was on the barricade. Rob brings the ladder in but Hardy jumps on RVD with the ladder. Then both men hit each other with the ladder. Then Jeff moonsaulted Rob while he was on the ladder. RVD then put Hardy on the ladder and performed the rolling thunder. As RVD tries to climb the ladder for the title, Hardy dropkicked the ladder while RVD was on it. With both men on the ground. RVD performed the five star frog splash, but misses. Then Hardy tried to climb the ladder RVD got up and suplexed him off of the ladder. The two go on the ladder again but this time Hardy sunset flipped Rob off the ladder. Then Jeff goes for the belt, but RVD removes the ladder with Jeff still hanging on. RVD eventually gets him off with an elbow. As Jeff goes for the belt again RVD tips him off the ladder and climbs the ladder himself. RVD ended up getting the win and the title. Overall amazing match. 8.75/10

6)Steel Cage Match Undertaker and Kane vs DDP and Kanyon
The story behind this match was that DDP was stalking the Undertaker's wife Sara. Obviously Undertaker didn't like it one bit so that's why this match happened. Not to much to say about this match it was just basically a beatdown on DDP and Kanyon. Kanyon escapes the cage and leaves while DDP is still in the cage. Undertaker and Kane got the win when Undertaker hit the Last Ride on DDP. 6.5/10

7) WWF Championship Kurt Angle vs Steve Austin
The story heading into the match was, because Steve Austin had betrayed WWF by costing Kurt Angle the WWF vs The Alliance match. Steve did this, because he was jealous of how Mr. McMahon was grooming Kurt Angle to being the next WWF champion. This match started with the two automatically beating each other up in the corner. Austin took control by targeting Kurt Angle's injured leg. Angle tries to get back up but he gets thrown out of the ring. Then Austin performed a multiple suplexes on Angle. Kurt takes back control with his signature three german suplexes, and continues to do four more suplexes. He attempts an angle slam, but Austin rakes Angle's eyes and throws him to the corner. Austin then performs a superplex off the top turnbuckle. Austin performs the stone cold stunner onto angle, but only for a two count. He tries another stunner knocking Kurt to the outside. Steve Austin throws Angle into the ring post multiple times busting him open. Angle is thrown back into the ring for a two count. The two take it back outside where Angle takes back control by throwing Austin over the barricade. Then Angle is suplexed onto the concrete. Angle then locks the Ankle Lock onto Austin outside of the ring. Angle brings Austin back for an Ankle Lock inside of the ring, but Austin escapes. The fight is taken to the outside yet again and Angle performs more suplexes on Austin outside. Austin is thrown into the inside and Angle moonsaults Austin and gets the two count. They get up and Austin uses the cobra clutch on Angle, but Angle reverses it by throwing Austin out. Stone Cold performs another stunner but again gets a two count. Then Angle performs and angle slam for another two count. The referee ends up getting knocked down by Austin, but another ref comes to count Angle's pin attempt, but yet again another nearfall. Then Austin low blows Angle and stuns the referee. Another referee comes only to be hit by the WWF Championship belt. Then Angle does another angle slam and covers Austin. Then referee Nick Patrick came down, but not to count the pin, but to disqualify Steve Austin. Angle ended up winning the match, but not the title. Kurt Angle then ankle locks Nick Patrick. Overall a really really good match. 9.25/10

8)WCW Championship The Rock vs Booker T
This match was not as good as Angle vs Austin, but still a good way to end the show. The match starts off right away with The Rock taking control. Then Booker T fights back with a few chops only for Rock to come back again. Then the two go back and forth and then take it outside. Then Rock put Booker on the announce table and low blowed him. Then Booker fought back when he atomic dropped Rock on the barricade. They fight in the crowd with Booker T in control. Booker tries to submit Rock but The Rock escapes both submissons and puts the sharpshooter on Booker T. Shane McMahon gets involved and Booker took advantage of it. Rock comes back with a DDT and gets a nearfall. Shane gives Booker a chair to distract the ref so Shane can hit The Rock. Little did Shane know the APA comes out and takes out McMahon, because of what he had done earlier in the night. Booker T performs the book end onto Rock and gets a nearfall. The Rock then comes back with a suplex only for a two count. The Rock then spinebusters Booker and the does The People's Elbow but as the referee counted Shane McMahon got involved. Then The Rock rock bottoms Shane on the outside. Booker spinebusters The Rock himself and did a scissors kick to The Rock. The finish came when Booker T did the spinaroonie, but The Rock kip upped and Rock Bottomed Booker T for the win and the WCW Title. Overall a great way to end the show and send the fans home happy. 8.5/10

Overall 8.25/10
This was a very good Summerslam and I'd recommend it to all hardcore fans of wrestling. I think this event is a bit underrated for what it is so it comes at a cheap price.",1342828800,,8496,4.455012853470437

7931549,4,B000055ZKE,"This is my 1st review ever. I used the star rating for my matches if you want to know. Now lets get on to SummerSlam 2001

1. Intercontinental Championship
Lance Storm(c) vs Edge
The match is fine for what it is. Nothing really that jumps off the card but its worth a one time watch. There is interference and fun in the end
(***)

2. 6 Man Tag Team Match
Spike & APA vs Test & The Dudleys
Just a normal short and fast paced tag match. Again worth a one time watch and watch for a huge chair shot at the end of the match.
(**1/4)

3. Light-heavyweight vs Cruiser-weight Title Unification
X-Pac(c) vs Tajiri(c)
Nice action here but not alot of highflying but still good. For the 3rd match in a row there is interference which i am not a big fan of unless it is properly used but it doesnt get in the way of what was a decent match
(***)

4. Rhyno vs Chris Jericho
This match had a nice story behind it with the gore through the titantron. Always loved that. Anyway this match has some really good spots and a really good ending
(***1/4)

5. Hardcore Title Ladder Match
RVD vs Jeff Hardy(c)
RVD was just brought into the WWF via ECW and brought excitement even though he was supposed to be the heel. This match was fun but there are alot of botches and isn't one of the top ladder matches that we were used to seeing in the beginning of 2001
(***1/2)

6. Tag Team Title Cage Match
Kane & Undertaker(c) vs DDP & Kanyon(c)
They main feud here was Undertaker and DDP with DDP stalking Sara( The Undertaker's Wife). The match itself felt more like a squash and made DDP look very bad here and would never recover. But not surprising since Undertaker and Kane weren't very good in 2001.
(*1/4)

7. WWF Championship
Kurt Angle vs Stone Cold(c)
Stone Cold and Angle were white hot around this time even though nobody liked Austin as a heel. This match was one of the top matches of 2001. The beating that Angle takes in this match makes him look like a star, and Austins facial expression help this match tremendously. Once again there is a shady finish but this is a damn near perfect match
(****3/4)

8. WCW CHampionship
The Rock vs Booker-T(c)
The Rock just came back a month earlier from making his movie and the fans were loving him. Booker was going to be just thrown to him since WCW guys weren't really made as much of a threat. This match is average for a main event. especially in 2001.
(***1/4)

Alright PPV, Bad Booking brings this down alot. WWF Title match is a must see",1300838400,,2475,4.293991416309013
7931550,5,B000055ZKE,"Edge VS Lance Storm: A good way to start off the PPV. Nothing to exciting but still good mat wrestling with Edge winning the IC belt in the end.

Dudley's and Test VS APA and Spike Dudley: A short but sweet match.

X-Pac VS Tajiri: A very good match between these two lightweights

Rhyno VS Chris Jericho: A very good story behind this match and the match was good. I prefered a hardcore match over this regular match.

Jeff Hardy VS RVD in a Ladder match: While this is not as good as Invasion, this match is still very exciting and well worth checking out.

DDP and Kanyon VS Undertaker and Kane in a Cage match: Kanyon and DDP were very good and exciting wrestlers but WWE wanted former WCW members to look as weak as possible. That being said, the match was decent but nothing worth going out of the way for.

Kurt Angle VS Steve Austin: Match of the night, maybe match of the year. A truly awesome bout that went all over the place and Angle was on his A game. The ending sucked but it really didn't take much away from this epic match.

Rock VS Booker T: Rock returns and wins the WCW world title from Booker T in a entertaining match. It wasn't good as Angle-Austin but still very good.

Overall, I enjoyed the Invasion angle even though WWF handled it poorly. DDP could have been a great heavyweight champion but he jobbed to Undertaker and hovered around the midcard. This PPV is highly recommend and Angle-Austin is one of the greatest matches you'll ever witness despite a crappy ending. It's true, it's damn true!",1259798400,,1525,4.402135231316726
