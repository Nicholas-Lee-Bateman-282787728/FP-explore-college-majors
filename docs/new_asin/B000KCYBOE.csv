8155688,3,B000KCYBOE,"I picked up this dollar DVD for the TV film ""The Christmas Carol"" only.  It runs about 23 minutes and seems complete, but in a half-hour time slot the story is very condensed.  It's an interesting little curio from the early days of TV.  The quality is good with only one noticeable splice.  The 1935 ""Scrooge"" is not worth watching as it is the horribly mutilated shortened version and a poor print also.  Image has the full-length version.",1246752000,,441,4.602564102564102
