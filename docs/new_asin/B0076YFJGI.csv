8511253,5,B0076YFJGI,Movie was in great shape and it was a great watch. Kinda creepy in some parts! Get it and you'll know what I mean. Great acting too! From the lead characters all the way to the dead girl! Awesome!,1358467200,2,196,4.051282051282051
8511254,5,B0076YFJGI,"Just when you think you have this movie figured out, you don't. I saw this movie on line in 17 episodes. It was like a very good book I couldn't put down. I had to find out what happens next so I had to keep clicking ""next episode"" until the last one. Buy the movie...it will save you all those clicks and recaps of the previous episode.

Well filmed, good acting, good music and an excellent story that makes you think you know what is going on and then you'll have to watch the movie again several times once you find out what is really going on.

This movie is worth having in your collection.

Great entertainment.",1348272000,2,618,4.264957264957265
8511255,4,B0076YFJGI,A must see sleeper movie with a surprise ending.  A lot of B movies are just just B movies.  This one is a good find and worth the purchase price.,1342569600,,146,3.8333333333333335
8511256,4,B0076YFJGI,Although there aren't any main stream actors in the movie it does have an intriguing story line and surprising ending.  Not an A list movie but certainly different and better than most of the other B type movies out there.,1340496000,,222,4.55
