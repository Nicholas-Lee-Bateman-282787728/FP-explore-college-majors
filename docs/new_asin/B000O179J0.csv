2789502,5,B000O179J0,"Wacky, hilarious and never ending entertainment!

Maybe these are old cartoon, but today, my 10 & 12 year sons are glued to the TV with Pinky and the brain (like me, old dad...).

A classic and apart from the bumpersticker title, there are many more themes you can think of. Enjoy!",1281830400,,281,4.490196078431373
2789503,5,B000O179J0,"make these review requests go away. The DVD is fabulous, the follow up annoying. Design the website for crappy slow third world service. Where's the submit button? How can I make this sloooooow web page go away? What a crappy design. You must be the red 'lectroids from the eighth dimension. Make the bells and whistles that chew up bandwidth go away.",1266105600,,351,4.67741935483871
2789504,5,B000O179J0,"If you are a fan of Pinky and the Brain then you need no review to know you must own these DVD's.  All the episodes are there, just as you remember them from the TV show.  And a few of the shorts that I wasn't sure would be there, such as the States Song are there too, attached to episodes.  I haven't watched all 3 DVD's yet, but I am hoping that Cheese from Around the world will show up too.  Great to have in any collection, Pinky and the Brain is going to be a cult classic.  Are you thinking what I'm thinking?",1261180800,28,517,3.9326923076923075

2789506,5,B000O179J0,"I had turned my Dad on to the show and purchased this set for him as a Christmas present.  I think it was his favorite present, its late January and he hasn't stopped watching it.

This was a great series, along with Animaniacs; with great adult humor undertones. A shame its not on the air anymore",1232323200,5,298,4.303571428571429
2789507,5,B000O179J0,"Great collection of all episodes on 3 DVD's. As I am a big fan of the series it was a must-have for me! Because I am Austrian I wanted to have a german DVD-box, but unfortunately there is none - so I decided to buy the english version.",1210723200,,235,3.9166666666666665
2789508,4,B000O179J0,"Pinky and the brain: seasons 1, 2, & 3.  They are just as delightfully insane as I had hoped.  The episodes on tv tend to repeat; this combo gets them all.  Great fun and sharp silliness. Some days you cheer for the brain, some days for Pinky.",1198368000,13,243,4.127659574468085

2789510,4,B000O179J0,A timely collection of classic cartoons designed to suit an adults sense of humour rather than children's in a clean way. Easy to sit down and watch one episode as a means of relaxation at the end of a long day or simply veg out for a whole day with the series.,1185408000,15,261,4.038461538461538

2789516,5,B000O179J0,"Animaniacs, which Pinky and the Brain are part of, are some of the best cartoons ever put on TV.  Sadly overlooked, they are brilliant in their humor for both adults and kids.  Pinky and the Brain are two mice who want to take over the world, and the adventures they go through while the Brain tries to implement his plan and Pinky...well, tries to go along, are hilarious!",1457827200,,373,4.470588235294118

I had grown up on afternoon cartoons, after this and the others left The WB, afternoon cartoons wemt down the tubes.  Get your hands on this collection, it will bring back great memories.

2789537,5,B000O179J0,"As far as spin-off goes, this is one of the best (originally characters from ''Animaniacs''). But just to specify, it does not include the continuing adventures in ''Pinky, Elmyra & The Brain''!",1409961600,,194,5.09375
2789538,5,B000O179J0,Gift receipient loved it,1406505600,,24,5.25
2789539,5,B000O179J0,This is a modern day classic cartoon series that provides the best ways to take over the world. I have learned so much from this series I recommend this for schools and churches. The input that pinky has provided is not equaled by any of the last four presidents. Brain could teach congress many new approaches to dealing with our society.,1403308800,3,339,4.573770491803279
2789540,5,B000O179J0,Both myself and my (6 year old) boy love watching this together. I'm a research scientist and work with lab rats so it's specially funny. A must for any 'young at heart' researcher's DVD library collection.,1399852800,,206,4.75
2789541,5,B000O179J0,This is an excellent classic cartoon series. You will enjoy watching this and can share this with your family. It is a very family friendly show.

It is definately work picking up on Amazon if it is still available.,1395100800,,334,4.234375
2789542,3,B000O179J0,"Seems like the primary concern Spielberg had when creating these discs was how to prevent people in other countries from having broadcast-quality episodes to pirate, because P&B volumes 1 - 3 look REALLY inferior even on a 40"" television screens. The scan lines are clearly visible, the colors are washed out and dull, and even my Sony upscaling DVD player can't do much with these discs because the source material was so overcompressed in order to fit this many episodes on these few discs. The quality episodes you watched on TV are NOT the low-quality episodes you'll be frustrated at watching in this series. Frankly, I'd wait for the Blu-Ray version of this series...",1394236800,7,673,4.912280701754386

2789545,4,B000O179J0,"First Brain reminded me of Napoleon, yet these animated characters were set in the late 1990's, along with the political events occurring at the time, making fun of their activities.

The product was in sealed good condition, apart from a slit, what appeared to be a knife mark on the case of the first season, however it did affect the disc. The service/communication from the seller was very good and clear. They immediately sent me reply and confirmation of purchase. Delivery was very quick and well before the estimated delivery time.

2789558,5,B000O179J0,"Got this for my brother who insisted on getting all the volumes of pinky and the brain! The price from this seller was unbeatable. I normally try to get Amazon prime eligible items so i can get them quickly, but the same product that was amazon prime eligible was $20 more. Plus it was for my brother n he didn't want to spend that much. When I got the confirmation email it told me that I wasn't getting this item till April 5, 2012. I got it today March 20, 2012.
