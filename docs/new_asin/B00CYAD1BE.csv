8587472,3,B00CYAD1BE,"I have to confess that I've become a Blu-ray snob. Blu-ray's superior picture and sound quality very closely approximates the concert hall experience (and in some ways -- thanks to close-ups and audio clarity -- exceeds it). Nowadays, the only non-Blu-ray DVDs I buy are of historical performances with relatively primitive picture and sound, because these would benefit little from the format upgrade.

Being given a review copy of this DVD provided me with an opportunity to see if I could be satisfied with a non-Blu-ray of a recently captured performance. I found the picture quality to be surprisingly good, only a couple of notches below Blu-ray and certainly better than an HD TV broadcast. The DVD sound (PCM 2.0) was very good but two dimensional. I really missed the surround-sound effect of 5.1 or 5.0. If you only have two speakers attached to your TV, though, you'll be more than satisfied.

Now, as to the performance itself. First up is what I consider one of the greatest symphonies ever, Tchaikovsky's 5th. In the DVD notes, veteran Charles Dutoit is described as ""an efficient conductor."" If that appears to be a less than ringing endorsement, this performance bears out the assessment. He keeps things moving along, but there's little fire or sense of existential angst. For that you have to experience Valery Gergiev conducting the Mariinsky Orchestra:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tchaikovsky-Symphonies-Nos-4-6-Blu-ray/dp/B005HK8KXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tchaikovsky: Symphonies Nos. 4-6 [Blu-ray</a>]. Unfortunately, that Blu-ray has the worst picture quality and direction I've encountered for an orchestral performance.

But back to the DVD at hand. Things heat up considerably with the Brahms Symphony No. 4, conducted by Manfred Honeck, an Austrian conductor who's been around a good while but is new to me. It's an energetic, muscular performance that better suits the Verbier Festival Orchestra, which consists of very young musicians.

Although the conductor and orchestra whip up a good amount of excitement in the Brahms, the competition on DVD for this symphony is very stiff. Putting aside a number of older performances (with titans like Carlos Kleiber, Karl Bohm and Leonard Bernstein conducting) that are limited in picture and sound, there is, for example, another EuroArts DVD:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brahms-Symphony-No-4-Double-Concerto-Wagner-Prelude-to-Parsifal/dp/B00354XVI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brahms: Symphony No. 4 & Double Concerto / Wagner: Prelude to Parsifal</a>. I haven't seen it, but it's Simon Rattle (an exceptional conductor) and the Berlin Philharmonic (my favorite orchestra), in surround sound. It would be hard to beat that. If it were to be released on Blu-ray, I'd be the first in line.",1372464000,,2858,5.862980769230769
