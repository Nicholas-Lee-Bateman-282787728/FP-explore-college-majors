2258140,5,B0008EN6L8,"Maintaining my health and fitness is important to me.  Fortunately, I found ""Chi Kung for Health, Volume I"", with Terence Dunn.  The exercises are not complicated and do not require postures that are difficult to maintain.  Initially, I was skeptical of the stated health benefits of ""Chi Kung for Health, Vol I"".  But after 2 weeks of daily practice, I did experience a natural boost of energy.  Now when I exercise I find that I have a reserve of energy and more stamina.  I highly recommend ""Chi Kung for Health, Vol I"" with Terence Dunn.

2258141,5,B0008EN6L8,"I had been suffering from insomnia for more than 2 years. I often spent 3 to 4 hours just trying to fall asleep. I tried many things - running, weight training, different types of yogas. All of them worked somewhat but their effects did not last long. I first tried this DVD last January and the insomnia stopped on the first day. After six months the insomnia did not come back and I feel better in every aspect of my life.

The exercises here are quite strenuous at first but become easier as you accumulate more energy. This DVD shares some similarity with Zhan Zhuang standing meditation. Reading ""The Way of Energy"" by Lam Kam-Chuen and doing some basic exercises there helped me do exercises in this DVD better.",1214265600,21,717,4.558139534883721
2258142,3,B0008EN6L8,"Qi gong, like yoga and tai chi, depends upon breath. Deep, sustaining breaths. I couldn't get all the way through the CD since this is sinus season. I can only hope, as I get further into the CD it will show the slow, sustained movements I'm used to. I have to say I was slightly disappointed; but I admit I've only seen a small part of the exercises.

2258143,3,B0008EN6L8,Good for people who want to no how to do the movements of chi gung. This dvd is missing the main aspect of chi gung. There is very little on how to breath with the movement and there is nothing on what the breth is about. The inhalation is the chi. This dvd should have explained how the chi is collected in the body to rengerize the body throw the movements. It is still good if you want the movements without the understanding,1184544000,8,428,4.168674698795181
2258144,5,B0008EN6L8,"These videos are the product of up to a decade and a half of refinement and are still the best on the subject. I have been practicing chi kung using Terence Dunn's flying phoenix system since 1994. At that time they were on VHS and difficult to navigate. He has now delivered them on DVD. The benefits are palpable and powerful from the first day of practice. To obtain maximum benefits, one has to be conscious, consistent and conscientious.

It is a science, because the results are reproducible. You will have results if you practice. You do not have to believe anything. Just follow the instructions. About the reviewer who wants more active movements, I urge him to be patient. Master this first basic series. It is the foundation for the other videos. The piece de resistance is the 20 minute long form meditation, which is quite complex in its movements and very powerful in its effects. I expect Mr Dunn is rendering that into DVD about now.

This series is probably all the chi kung that the majority of people would need.",1166227200,33,1031,4.628415300546448
2258145,5,B0008EN6L8,very well presented and easy to follow i started practicing tai chi using his dvd for the yang long form and liked it so much i decided to try the chi kung. i workout regularly with tae-bo and low/high impact aroebics and found the tai chi and chi kung a perfect compliment. the music and the way he instructs are calming and informative enough to give you background to appreciate what your doing.,1162339200,15,398,4.465753424657534
2258146,5,B0008EN6L8,"This DVD instruction on Chi Kung standing meditations is excellent. It is a high quality presentation that is expertly done. The demonstration and instruction are easy to see and understand. It is a more demanding workout than it may appear at first glance, but it is well worth it. I highly recommended this DVD to anyone looking for a set Chi Kung excecises that are demanding without being strenuous. It is clear and easy to understand set of meditations that is well worth the price. It is also a good introduction to Chi Kung excercises.

However, this is not a dynamic workout, and the movements are slow and tranquil. The background music is also a soft easy going set of new age tunes, and this is not an excercise set for someone looking for a fast and high paced workout.

It is a calming and relaxing series of excercises that is soothing and meditative. It is also a fun set of excercises that are invigorating and relaxing wihout being too demanding and strenuous.",1141516800,70,977,4.641618497109826
2258147,3,B0008EN6L8,"These meditations are about 50 min with 10 min intro & slow, Qi Gong warm-up made with some of the fundamental movements & postures.
All movements are done standing or in a small horse stance which should not be hard on anyone even with limited mobility as long as they can stand normally.
There are only 2 movements one of which is ""Monk gazing at moon"" that your arms move at all & the last one, ""Wind above the clouds"" which includes mild stretching down to one foot at a time.
All other movements are held still for 5 min though he encourages you to hold it longer on your own.
All movements proceed with breathing beforehand such as inhaling, exhaling only 50% then only 30% then only 10% with normal inhale/exhaling in between each modified exhale. They do feel good, helping you to breath deeper into your belly for better oxygen like babies do.
Any movements are also done super slow, slower then even most Qi Gong dvds I own.
I did feel calmer doing it, but since my mind is always racing, I had trouble holding the postures & sitting still. Other people may not have as much trouble & get more out of it then me. I like other Qi Gong where there are more arm movements to keep my mind occupied.
The background nature is beautiful to see and adds calming effect to the mind as well. Terrence Dunn does have great energy and this a beautifully done dvd.",1138924800,53,1361,4.383399209486166
2258148,5,B0008EN6L8,"I have found these Chi Kung exercises easy-to-follow and very effective at increasing an awareness of chi and its flow.  Terry's explanations and demonstrations are very clear, and he takes the instruction at a nice, leisurely pace.  The production of the DVD is excellent, also.

Chi Kung is much easier to learn from a video, than Tai Chi, and produces benefits quickly.

The only addition to Terry's instruction that I would like to have seen is something about the more ""esoteric"" elements of the movements.  For example, when your hands pass near certain areas of the body, you are bringing fresh chi into those areas, in effect recharging them with energy, or redistributing energy.  However, this is something you can intuit when you become adept at the movements.

To help with learning the relationship between chi kung movements and this ""recharging"" with chi, I would recommend Wen-Mei Yu's book on chi kung.  Studying this book will give you a good ""feel"" for how movements recharge the body with chi.

All in all, Terry's are the best chi kung video/DVDs I have seen.",1134777600,51,1080,4.8901098901098905

Instructor Terence Dunn, who has more than 30 years of experience in the Flying Phoenix Celestial Healing Maiden discipline of Chi Kung developed over 400 years ago, guides the viewer through exercises designed to release tension, promote mind-body harmony, and encourage the fullness of energy. In Chi Kung For Health, viewers learn five basic standing meditations: Monk Holding Pearl, Monk Gazing At Moon, Monk Holding Peach, Bending the Bows, and Wind Above the Clouds.

2258153,5,B0008EN6L8,"Sifu Dunn puts together a set of standing qigong exercises that are specifically geared for healing and recovery.  The great thing about these exercises is that once you complete the breath sequence, one-pointed concentration is not critical for the movement phase of the exercises.  His instruction is very straight-forward and the video quality is very good.  The Flying Phoenix system delivers a lot of health benefits for a very small investment in practice.",1317254400,3,462,5.301369863013699
2258154,5,B0008EN6L8,"This is in fact about the copmplete series for Chi Kung for Health:

I am 49 years old and have some yoga and taichi background. When I came across these series a year ago, I was amazed to see for the first time  very noticable increase in my energy levels in a very short practice span, like a week. I have been doing at least one exercise a day since then, and dropped almost all of other practices as I found these series very satisfactory replacement for that kind of energy work.

The series are:

-Very simple to follow and straightforward to learn from a CD

-Very energising. You actually rest while doing the exercises with minimum effort, and when you start doing them right (you figure it out easy by the energy output) each stance is like a dynamo generating and cycling lots of good energy in your body. Some of my muscles was used actively for the first time, so I had a little fatigue after some exercises in the beginning, but it passed after about 2 weeks.

-Promoting real health. For 7 months, I did the exercises daily with another mild half-hour work out,which I had been doing for years, and did not even sneeze once during this period. Then I had to drop the workout, but continued doing these exercises, flues started again, but my recovery times are much shorter now, and my chronic migraine disappeared, hopefully for ever. I seriously recommend doing these exercises with a mild physical work out as they supplement each other and really boost the immune system.

-An excellent solid road to walk into inner spiritual work. These are not just physical exercises, that's why I believe you get results you are looking for rather quickly.

Sifu Terry Dunn has excellent support for all of my questions on line, and there is a nice documentation covering almost every aspect of the system you can find on an internet forum. Just google it.",1315612800,16,1862,4.604229607250756
2258155,5,B0008EN6L8,"I've been practicing various forms of Chi Kung for the past few years and I've purchased over a dozen different DVDs, but I have seen nothing else like Sifu Dunn's Flying Phoenix Chi Kung.  The most notable difference is the breathing instructions.  He doesn't just tell you when to breathe in and out, he expains a more sophisticated method of percentage breathing that I have never seen before or since.  I'm not sure how it works, but there is something special about this breathing method.

The meditations themselves are very simple, but also very powerful.  If you have practiced Tai Chi/Chi Kung style meditations before, I think you will find these to be an excellent addition to your practice.  For me, they have become the cornerstone of my meditation practice (along with the seated meditations in volume 2).

If you are a beginner, I can think of no better program to start with.  The meditations are easy to learn, and fast acting.  The very first time I tried them, I was amazed (albiet somewhat startled) with the rapid results I experienced.  Over time, these meditations have helped me to become more grounded/rooted in my Tai Chi practice.  They have also helped me to feel and relieve muscle tension that I was not previously even aware of.  Additionally, my leg strength and overall health have improved.",1315526400,17,1324,4.835555555555556
2258156,5,B0008EN6L8,"For quite a while i've been looking for dvd based chi kung that i can do at home in my spare time.
I found the Flying Phoenix series and started practicing in the spring of this year.

Even though I have no background in martial arts I found working with the DVDs easy and effective. Instructions are clear,
concise and easy to follow which, in may case, produced increase vitality and better health within weeks .

2258157,5,B0008EN6L8,"Ok so first off I have heard of Terry Dunn before. Of course his Tai Chi videos are everywhere and if you have looked into Tai Chi videos at your bookstore or library you most likely have seen his material out there. For some reason I had him pigeon holed there without realizing he also had some very good Qigong videos.
Ah, but they are not just average Qigong videos. This is the Flying Phoenix Chi Kung system which is a very simple and effective Qigong style passed down to him from Grandmaster Doo Wai.
Ok, so I don't know much about Grandmaster Doo Wai, but I do know that this set really works really well for me.
It is fairly simple in it's execution but very effective and also incorporates some simple breathing formulas which really add something good to the practice.
I have added a couple of these to my regular routine and have found myself sleeping sounder, dreaming better, and generally being in a more relaxed and energetic state.
If you like this DVD you should check out the second in the series. It is really similar to this one but with sitting exercises that really compliment the standing.
I have studies many Qigong systems, and I am now to the point where I am feeling that there is great depth in simplicity. The exercised presented on this DVD are simple to learn and practice, and in my opinion are very effective and a great add on to ones Tai Chi or Gong Fu practice.
I give it 5 stars because it is filmed well, easy to follow and learn from, and very effective. I couldn't really think of a way to improve it.",1281225600,20,1543,4.379790940766551
2258158,5,B0008EN6L8,"I have been practicing different forms of Qigong (Chi Kung) for nearly 8 years, and have practiced a number of really fine Qigong systems.  That said, while the other forms of Qigong I have practice have been beneficial, I can honestly say Terry Dunn's Chi Kung for Health series is the most powerful I have practiced.

The ""secret sauce"" of the Flying Phoenix Chi Kung system is a unique set of breathing sequences to begin each exercise.  This breath sequence has never before been revealed.  I can tell you from experience that the breath sequence coupled with the movements of each exercise are amazingly powerful.

I have been practicing every day for five months now, and the results have been outstanding.  I have felt significantly more energy as I go through my work day, I feel less stress, I have sharper mental acuity and creativity and a more positive attitude.  Also, I've had a number of people tell me I look younger, more refreshed.  I'm in my 50's, so this is a good thing.

The Flying Phoenix style of Chi Kung as taught by Master Dunn is esoteric, and generates a higher level, and extremely positive Qi energy.  Also, the results of practicing Flying Phoenix are cumulative.  The longer you practice, the more energy the forms generate.

The DVD's are well presented and are easy to follow, with nice outdoor scenery as a backdrop.  The benefits of this Chi Kung are actually *understated* by Terry Dunn.  You will be pleasantly surprised by the practice, and don't be surprised if the actual benefits you experience go above and beyond your initial expectations.

One reason I began practicing Qigong nearly 8 years ago was the promise of ""rejuvenation"".  This is the first form of Qigong that I can honestly say delivers on the promise in spades.  In as little as 15 minutes a day, you'll see tangible results.  If you practice longer, say 30 minutes to an hour a day, you'll be astounded with the results.

I can only thank Terry Dunn for sharing this powerful form of Chi Kung on his ""Chi Kung for Health"" Series.  After buying and practicing this first DVD, I found the results so strong that I went back and purchased them all.  Master Dunn's Chi Kung Series DVD's are real treasures.

There's also a very serene and focused state that comes over the mind when engaged in these practices, so calling them 'meditations' is not at all inaccurate.  Production values on the DVD are what you might call ""professional indie"" -  nothing fancy, yet totally charming (and who wouldn't love the 'Zen Bear?').
