1964992,3,B00011V872,"Derrida does what so many other monographs on famous people does, alienates the subject and gives us an interesting, stilted look into his/her life.
I attended a screening of this movie this afternoon in my university's english department, this afternoon.  The question-and-answer period that followed, however was anything but tame, and that's when I, perhaps, realized the value of this film, to get people to ask questions.
The whole idea of a biographical picture on Derrida seems almost unnecessary, considdering his feelings on the subject of biography (which are made clear almost immediately in the film).  So we must ask the question, why this film, why is it necessary?  Moreover, the crew spent a considerable amount of time shooting the philosopher so the fact that they included such insipid questions raises a question in itself...why are they there?  Perhaps they are there to show that Derrida can inprovise better than he claims he can.  Perhaps they are there to remind us that deconstructionalism cannot be defined.
Whatever the case, it will certainly spark lively debate, however, I'm not quite sure if this film is really a serious profile of the philosopher or something of a slightly cruel burlesque.  After all, we often find ourselves unintentionally laughing at his attempts to answer questions with the restraint and rigour that philosophy demands.
And finally, an observation, while the english muffin has often been cited as the film's one look into his ""true life,"" I'd like to propose yet another alternate title, ""Derrida's Joke"" (which references one of the early scenes in the film when he makes the joke about the philosopher falling in the well while looking up at the stars).  These few moments allow us to see his tastes outside of the cloak of rigour that he wears, almost definsively throughout the movie.  They help make the film worthwile.",1077926400,6,1882,5.087662337662338
1964993,5,B00011V872,"I really enjoyed this one. It would be especially good to see right after reading Derrida's own Archive Fever, which this film draws from both by quoting some of its passages, and by ""deconstructing"" the filmmakers' own efforts to get at who and (or perhaps versus) what Derrida is. I agree with a reviewer for The Guardian, who wrote that the filmmakers ""produce an enthralling, playful film that constantly frustrates our desire to know the 'truth' about this man, while deconstructing the very format of the biography in a manner that Derrida would doubtless give his blessing to."" And on the DVD's extra features, he does just that, at a New York opening of the film.
Those looking for penetrating and critical analysis of Derrida's work and ideas should go elsewhere. As Derrida basically says at one point in the film, such people should ""do their homework"" and go READ. The music works very well, and many of the ragged, unedited edges purposely left in the film extract a playfulness from Derrida, and from his philosophical methodology itself. So in that sense it's about Derrida and his ideas, but it's also about how biographical efforts themselves (which we all make when we ""get to know"" anyone in our lives) are fraught with illusions and impossibilities.
My favorite parts were about love; the filmmakers ask him to say something about it, and he says he can't, but then he does, nicely deconstructing the question, of course, separating ""who"" we think love from ""what"" we love them for. Sure, the film is a hagiographic portrait, but ultimately, I think we're being asked a good question: what do those who revere Derrida love him for? Shouldn't they separate the two? but if they do, how well can they do so?
Good companion film: Notebook on Cities and Clothes.",1077062400,11,1778,4.832786885245902
1964994,1,B00011V872,"Agree with the prior customer views, big time. On Derrida's resistance to the project, he gets no complaint from me. He clearly gave extraordinary access and tried very hard to cooperate, but the crew was so intrusive and inefficient with lights and mikes and the questions so insipid, that he just seemed constantly amazed at what he was being subjected to. Alas, name it Derrida Butters His Toast if you want to do some self-inflated student art project. I learned close to zero about Derrida the thinker, other than he seems to be a nice old French fellow with a long standing marriage and a successful practice in teaching and writing.
Taking on a project with this potential, spending years with this level of intimate access, and calling it Derrida, suggesting breadth of content, but bringing little insight about his thinking to the screen outside of mostly silly gimmicks, is a sad sad thing.",1076716800,16,901,4.857142857142857
1964995,3,B00011V872,I like the way this meta-documentary shows Derrida reflecting on the film itself. It shows how hard it would be to produce a stereotypical biography of a philosopher who is still alive. The film would definitely have been nothing like this if Derrida was dead.,1075939200,3,260,4.8
1964996,1,B00011V872,"This mockumentary is guaranteed to attract some interest, since Derrida, whatever the audience may know of him, is rather telegenic. Unfortunately, he gets the Ozzie Osbourne treatment here - the philosopher as the slightly uncooperative star of his own reality show, unable to shake the camera crew for long.
You learn how he finds his house key, how he prepares a snack, and how he puts on his coat. You see his wife, some of his friends, tight smiles, trying to stay out of the picture. What you don't get much of is the man doing what made him famous - and even less an exploration of his career. Who or what does he read, talk about, care about, when he is not forced, by the insistent camera, to answer slightly embarrassing questions?
To give him credit, Derrida works hard to contribute something intelligent to the show, as for instance when he reflects on the impoliteness of philosophical biographies. Indeed, this stalker movie makes you wonder what they actually wanted from Derrida. Kirby Dick never got any of the dozens of people he filmed to tell a good Derrida joke, and Amy Kofman's flirtations with the tan and trim thinker will make the audience squirm.
If you want to see Derrida talk about film, watch 'Ghost Dance' or his television interviews with Stiegler. If you want to hear him reflect on his career, watch the French documentary Safaa Fathy made with him. But if you ever wondered what might happen when you put a professor into a kind of reverse witness protection program, as Warhol did with Ondine, then watch this DVD. Beware though: the heavy-handed use of voice-overs may make you sad that the years of footage and access Amy Kofman and got in the end amount to little more than having the fan put the master's words into her own mouth.",1074729600,44,1772,4.664536741214057
1964997,3,B00011V872,"Derrida (Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering Kofman, 2002)
Kirby Dick (Sick, Private Practices) and first-time director Amy Ziering Kofman take a look at, arguably, the most important and influential philosopher of the twentieth century, Jacques Derrida. And perhaps ""take on"" is the best way to understand the dynamic of this film.
Kofman's intention was to get away from the philosophy, for the most part, and get to the quotidian existence of Derrida's life. Which is all well and good, except that people who go to see a film about Jacques Derrida are going to want the philosophy. But looking at it strictly from the slice-of-life aspect, the film still comes off looking like a student project. (Co-director Kirby Dick, who came in after the start of production, mentions the ""naivete"" of the footage that had already been shot in interviews. Indeed.)
It probably doesn't help that Derrida keeps throwing monkeywrenches into the works himself. It's not as if he feels uncomfortable with the camera, though his reactions at times may be mistaken for such; it is more that Derrida feels an acute sense of being filmed, which at times makes him reluctant and at times makes him somewhat mischievous. (Kofman is from Los Angeles; during a lecture, for example, Derrida mentions that the last film the class looked at from LA was footage of the Rodney King riots, and goes on to pull the parallel out farther.) The end result being a documentary with no finesse about a subject who is reluctant to be a subject.
One thing of note, though: the wonderful score by Ryuichi Sakamoto (Wild Palms, etc.). It is brilliant, and perhaps does a better job of underscoring things here than does the direction. Lovely.
While a look into the life of Jacques Derrida is a rare and wonderful thing, and needs to be treasured, I wish Dick had been the author here, or a similarly gifted documentarist. What we have could have been-but wasn't. ** ",1074643200,20,1922,4.8419452887537995
1964998,2,B00011V872,"I was really excited when I saw trailers for this film but the finished version left me wanting something more.  There was no mystery, no build up, nothing to make you want to watch this film to the end.  You get to see Derrida going about his daily business, eating, dressing, speaking, walking around various cities, and watching him be interviewed.  I had just read some of 'The Truth About Painting' and wanted to learn more about this man and his theory of Deconstruction.  But this film wasn't what I was looking for.",1184112000,,523,4.591397849462366
1964999,5,B00011V872,"If you've followed Derrida's work then you may really enjoy this. I found the narrater, narration really annoying. If you can leave that aside then it is quite interesting seeing the late Philosopher.

It's more a look at Derrida's life than how to do deconstruction.

If your an anti-deconstructionist then you may be wasting your time.",1170720000,4,337,5.0
1965000,3,B00011V872,"I cant believe this movie brought up the problems with autobiography, then proceeded to construct the most hip, glamourizing image of derrida. ""He lived, he thought, he died."" All along with press following him, images of cameras following him around, and hip, computor-altered narrative voices listing all the ""cool"" parts of his childhood.  Sometimes when he actually employs deconstrucionism to the actual interview process and starts to show with the value of getting out of cultural-assumptions, a narrator pops in with some over-simplification. Overall this is a pretty cool movie and makes derrida look really cool, but mostly by attaching a lot of culturally ""cool"" baggage to derrida and not really getting at the kind of honesty that deconstructionism is all about. It seems like the incredible focus on imagery was more important than expressing things honestly. There must have been a lot of money involved.",1163808000,3,919,5.294520547945205
1965001,5,B00011V872,"Around a half century ago the Jesuit priest Teilhard de Chardin was often uttering pure gibberish.  Peter Medawar perspicaciously pointed out that  ""A good deal of Teilhard is nonsense, but on further reflection I can see it as a dotty, euphoristic kind on nonsense...""  Teilhard's adoring fans, Medawar added, naively embraced ""the comical fallacious syllogism that runs `Profound reasoning is difficult to understand; this work is difficult to understand; therefore this work is profound.'""  Alas, our present era we have the works of Jacques Derrida,  Paul De Man, and others within the deconstructionist movement to entertain us.  Derrida says bewildering stuff like ""So there is a real future beyond this other known future.""  Huh?  Needless to add, it is not the only time when Derrida will make you laugh.  This is an inadvertently humorous film.  So much so, it well deserves five stars.  Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering Kofman are also to be congratulated for alerting the general public to the shenanigans occurring in many liberal arts departments of our major universities.  They are, to be blunt, stark raving lunatic asylums.  Shockingly, many of the less than admirable academics who worshipped the ground Derrida walked on---earn six figure incomes!  Something is definitely wrong.

Was the late Jacques Derrida as profound as Britney Spears?  Could he truly begin to intellectually compete with her?  Wow, that's a rough call.  It may be best to flip a coin to resolve this existential mystery of the universe.  I am personally betting on Ms. Spears.  Derrida was essentially a nihilist unable to think and follow a logical argument.  The previously mentioned Mr. Dick is also responsible for putting together ""Sick: The Life and Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist.""  Oh my goodness, what will be his next project?  I'm almost afraid to find out.

1965002,2,B00011V872,"27 bucks? Even used at 17 is questionable. Americans love to elevate certain regular ""Others"" to superstardom - this is true. I almost died for Derrida watching this film...what was with all the incessant following him around? How many times do we need to see him walk down the street as if being followed by paparazzi? Yes, we got the point but the filmmakers never moved on...probably because, like so many of the other reviewers have said here, they lacked the depth and knowledge to do so.

...the questions were indeed amateurish and a waste of time...the parallel to Seinfeld was especially embarrassing and I was pleased to see Derrida deflect it by saying that if one was really interested in the matter at hand they wouldn't watch such sit-coms.

...and I do agree that the narrator's blandness was most unpleasant and contrived.

...and no this film absolutely did not stimulate my curiosity on deconstructive thinking...it only made me want to deconstruct the flaky, shallow American filmmakers who made it.",1156464000,3,1018,4.976470588235294

Even though the hollywood-driven glorification of Derrida as a superhero of philosophy was annoying -- if not furiating at times, the video did, however, suceed in unveiling fundamental character traits of the philosopher. Namely, the documentary revealed that Derrida reserved himself from idiotic probing into his personal sex life which, needless to say if granted, the editors/director would exploit by marketing to stupified masses (The same masses who only buy-into the dramatized or ""controversial""). For that reason alone - that Derrida himself recognized this and, to counter it, distanced himself from exploitative questions - it was worth watching.

Since I have not read any of Derrida's work YET, I simply can not say anything about his philosophy. However, the overly sensationalized/dramatized voice reading passages of Derrida's philosophy did offer some incredible insight into his thoughts.

*******Update, May 4, 2007.

I just watched this film a second time. Why? I don't know. Curiousity, perhaps. I thought maybe after several months I would find something new in it. But I found nothing. IN fact, I reafirmed--even strengthened--my original stance that this film is an idiotic, hollywood attempt at cashing in on philosophy. I feel ashamed for the film makers, and empathetic for Jacques who had to suffer such idiotic probing. I hope he never watched this film. He must be turning in his grave.",1156464000,3,1434,5.364444444444445
1965004,5,B00011V872,"Derrida said about this film: ""It will either be a master piece or a catastrophe!"" The film deserves five stars for various reasons, yet convincing him to allow it to be produced is reason enough! (Derrida was against the project, until it began).

The producers superbly deal with the aporias of authorship - between the effacement of biographic fixity (as explored by Derrida and Foucault) and the violence of signature in text production. The producers' brilliant solution was to reflexively expose and play on this tension, rather than ignore or succumb to it (- otherwise, there would be no DVD!). the title was going to be ""Chasing Derrida"", how pertinent, but dropped for whatever reason.

It seems then that Amazon reviewers - both favorable and negative - miss the point: this film is not about providing philosophical depth or biographical richness. It is about creating an aesthetic piece that stimulates our curiosity about deconstructive thinking, not as authorship or questioning, but as an investigation of the trace of alterity: the engagement with the Other which so much fascinated Derrida.

As such, while the film provides glimpses of Being slipping between trivia and deconstruction, I totally agree with Derrida's own opinion: ""I love this film!""",1148688000,4,1268,5.205882352941177
1965005,5,B00011V872,"Derrida is a philosopher who focuses especially on the implications of the fact that reality has a future.  In other words, the ultimate state of things is not yet settled--and never will be!  This is equally true of reality as a whole and of an individual life.  The central question of human action is how to live in a way that addresses this futurity.  How in dealing with ourselves, and how in dealing with others, can we both respect the specificity that our lives, our reality, has already taken on, and simultaneously be open to the indeterminateness and unexpectedness of the future, a future in which we may well be confronted with circumstances that require of us that we radically transform ourselves, that we change our expectations and prejudices in order to address what comes.  How can we responsibly address the singularity, the specificity and the openness of a life, or of our world?  These are the deepest and most demanding questions of philosophy, as they are the deepest and most demanding questions of life.  This film, engages these questions by taking the singular life of the man, Jacques Derrida, as its theme.  The film presents (so far as a short, non-technical film can) the thought of this man--a central dimension of his specificity--juxtaposed with other specifics of his life (his family, his home), and with the mortal, personal singularity of his existence, as a way of invoking these philosophical questions about the nature of a life and its meaning.  This film is provocative, intelligent and moving.  I recommend it highly, and I especially recommend it for use in university courses that touch on these philosophical themes.",1140048000,6,1665,4.978339350180505
1965006,5,B00011V872,"'Derrida' is more than a chronical of the philosopher or his life. To do justice to the theory that he has become most famous for, deconstruction; the filmakers used a stylized approach to capture the philospher's life. I don't think that the film or the subject matter are so esoteric that it is inaccessible.

The bonus features are also fantastic. Derrida has surprising humor and predictable depth. For me, this film has immense value in that you cannot just watch it once and forget about it. You have to watch it a few times and on each viewing you gain new insights into life.",1123545600,7,583,4.605769230769231
1965007,5,B00011V872,"Of course, a primer on deconstruction in the form of a movie for the consumption of the general public, or even an educated subset of that public would be a hopeless task.  So what can we hope for?  We get a taste of Derrida's quickness and playfulness and the everyday sequences may go a long way to dispelling the foreboding nihilistic spectre that those who wilfully wish to be blind to any understanding of Deconstruction have sometime constructed of him.  For those with some understanding, hearing Derrida speak, and work on ideas on the fly is a wonderful experience.  The interviewers focus may not have been on issues that seem to me more central -- there are quotes, perhaps such as from Margins on metaphor that might perhaps have been more interesting a focus -- but they are interesting nonetheless.  I do wish they had more footage with interview of others on Derrida.  The filmakers apparently claimed to want to avoid glosses on Derrida, but the selection of scenes, questions, times and editing of the filmakers are a gloss of the most obvious and intrusive form.  Apparently they interviewed Spivak -- I can't help believe that this would have been wonderful material even if put into the special feature component of the DVD.  Her take, focussed by her obvious deep understanding might have done much to allay the qualms of those voicing complaints about a lightness on the philosophy.

I found the scenes in which selections from his works are read in voiceover to be both lyrical and appropriate to the ""action"" taking place in the film.  Those who are expecting ""an Introduction to Derrida""--a film of a series of lectures and seminars which explain or summarize his thought--will be disappointed with this film.

1965009,5,B00011V872,"This is an incredible dvd about an extraordinary philosopher.  Derrida, the man, comes across paradoxically as robust and vulnerable.  In private moments he seems almost sad, lonely.  Dick and Zierig Kofman did a great job editing the film and the cinematography is challenging.  The narration includes quotes from his works and are truly beautiful passages, many from Archive Fever: A Freudian Impression.

The film is touching, as when his wife, Marguerite (a psychoanalyst), kisses him as she leaves to work and the film shows her leave.  Another moving moment is when Derrida is lecturing in South Africa and a student challenges his concept of forgiveness.  Certainly the film has its humorous moments.  But death, justice and the Other are undercurrents which are not lost on Dick and Zierig Kofman.  If you liked or respected Derrida when he was alive you should see this film (dvd), made all the more poignant now that he has ""left us"". But he has not left us with only loss...he leaves us with a corpus of work that will endure the ages and give his name a place among the greatest thinkers the world has known.  ""Deconstruction is already [and always]at work"".  This does not change because he is gone.  It merely keeps the work[s] in motion.

In one of my two favourite scenes, Derrida points out the inherent tension between the viewers' expectations that they are 'seeing Derrida', and the fact that he is not the same when viewed by a camera.  My other favourite scene is Derrida's response to question about which philosopher his mother would have been.  This was probably the only good question in the whole film.  Other than these two scenes, the film is filled with banal shots of Derrida's life that tell us little about Derrida the person and reveal nothing about his intellectual thought.",1101600000,5,679,4.886956521739131

This was certainly their prerogative, and in some ways, ironically, a more fitting experiential sort of primer; but it seemed to me squandered access to one of our time's most celebrated minds.

  20-30% of the movie was shot by a 3rd or 4th camera with the primary camera in the picture blurring lines of story teller and subject and there were protracted segments of Jacques buttering bread or walking down the street that were thick with irony.  However, it seemed this film was more about the cleverness of the filmmakers than the thoughts of a powerful mind.  There is little discussion of deconstruction and the interviewers get him to talk at length about topics clearly not central to his program.  Eventually the ubiquity of the unsteady cam shots and ""decentered"" (yes, I know, another artistic representation of Derrida's method) visual focus became a distraction.  There is some footage from seminars that is outstanding and periodic quotes are helpful and appropriate.  On the whole I have to rate this DVD highly because there is nothing like it - but it represents a bit of a missed opportunity - there is no reason 2 weeks of access to this man should not result in 5 stars.  85 minutes of compiled lecture and seminar clips would be a more helpful introduction to Jacques Derrida",1095552000,10,1436,4.848360655737705

1965015,2,B00011V872,"I recently attended a showing of ""Derrida"", a biographical documentary on the French philosopher, Jaques Derrida, who is famous for ""deconstructionism"". A californian film crew follows Derrida as he gives lectures, answers interviewers' questions and discusses aspects of his life and philosophy. It's not often that we get to see documentaries of famous living philosophers in America, so I was quite enthusiastic about viewing this film.
Derrida observes towards the end of his film that this documentary will have more to say about the film crew than about him, Jacques Derrida, because it will be the film crew to edit the shootings and decide ""which Jacques Derrida"" is to be presented. If that is indeed the case, then the movie tells us its creators were young, inexperienced, not well-versed in philosophy; they missed a golden opportunity to meaningfully explore the life and philosophy of the last great post-structuralist.
At regular intervals, difficult passages from Derrida's writings flash on the screen, leaving us little time to ponder them. Sound bytes don't work well for Derrida! The interviewers questions are haltingly broad, ""What do you have to say on the subject of love?"", haltingly personal, ""Tell us about how you fell in love with your wife?"", or haltingly stupid, ""which philosopher would you have liked as a mother?"". To his credit, Derrida either refuses to answer such questions, or reformulates them into intelligent ones. At one point Derrida begins to make interesting comments on the myth of ""Narcissus"" and ""Echo"", obviously alluding to the relationship between ""source"" and ""simulacra"", but the interviwer fails to ask penetrating questions to draw him out on the matter.
After a family lunch, Derrida himself, turning the tables, asks an overly broad question of the interviewer: ""What did you think of my family?"". ""Il sont tres gentils, tres chaleureux"" is the response. I wonder if the irony of this was lost on Derrida and the film crew.
We see Derrida eat, get a haircut and meet friends...a warm fuzzy to remind us that Gallic philosophers are, after all, just like us. In short, if Americans suddenly took more interest in the lives of French philosophers than Britney Spears, this film would be on ""People"" magazine's recommended list. Tant pis.

The graphics the cinemagraphic feel(s) are fantastic the opening of the movement in a car it what looks like on-his-way-to work Paris it has a wonderful rhythm,the overweight apartment buildings (Six High, Ten across) slowing gliding on (the unseen road) like a wave. Derrida even probes the idea of ""archive"" what is testimony in the very act of making a film. He kindly explains to his Parisian class on this intrusion with a film crew to his left, "" a gauche""
We see his library to the ceiling in a modest part of the home, the entire place is small,cramped, more contemplative.
""Did you read all these books?""
No ""I read about four five of them, but I read those five very well""
We see him buttering a bagel or English muffin with sometransparent-like light-green/brown jelly anda large cup of black coffee,gently then returning the glass lid  to the butter container: some breakfast! then saying good buy to his wife Marguerite also off to work.
Derrida has a wonderfully elegant glass office,computer dominating the desk with typical assortment of books mixed with writing ledgers with tablets,hard ansd softcards, scrap paper (S)outside; well with a glass ceiling and glass walls/windows to the front off his yard, no flowers just green; with interesting green elegant plants placed, mostly inside.
He visits Nelson Mandela's cell of 18 years on Robyn Island South Africa. Quite powerful boat ride. Then discusses ""forgiveness"" to a primarially white student body. Derrida believes in ""irony"" that it should challenge the commonsense, what we expect. We are always compelled to give the answer everyone already expects to hear. So ""improvisation"" is also important for it disrupts the stereotypical discourse we hear everyday.
We see him ""thinking"" as well, When asked a question like ""Can/If your mother could have been a philospher and if she was how would that have changed things""
""Give me a moment. . . .""  . . .  it is a good question. . . ""
There can never be ""pure forgiveness"" but ""to forgive"" to further a cause, or fashion change through forgeveness some part of reality,of time or the future(l'avenir) Derrida endorses.
There is some walking in this film as well as the opening crossing a street ""Watch Out! Derrida exclaims (not shouting) to his hosts in New York University."". . .  like the philosopher looking at the stars while falling into a well. . . ""
If you are unfamiliar with Derrida, this is a good place to start, there are well tthought of excerpts spoken over the images and motions and movements, amnay from ""Archive Fever""
His exposition of Echo and Narcissus was also interesting,, ""all speech is blind"" for it stops whatever else can be thought. And what then of philosophy, that it has wandered through history that it has always fed on its own anxiety, its own pain.
""I would have liked Hegel and Heidegger to speak about their sex lives""
Why?""

8005207,2,B00011V872,"How strange it is see the banal paired with the almost Talmudic elements of Derrida's thought:  this pairing, this humanizing of Derrida in Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering Kofman's documentary that shares his name is, in an subtle way, the mystification of abstract thoughts.  The idea that one must humanize the philosopher still implies a certain alienation from abstraction that one sees here in Derrida.  The key moments on the speech on forgiveness and all the Heideggerian and structuralist jargon with Derrida twists and turns into his maze of Deconstructive readings which can be frustrating, but as also illuminating.  Derrida does play with the film makers at times, reflecting on how rude the biographies of philosophers can be, or what the sex life of his precursors could have been, but that doesn't save this film.  One can also feel Derrida's discomfort with the camera and lights, and with the flirtations of idealization of philosophy.

The idea that we need the quotidian to off-set the ""special"" abstract still puts in place the special abstract:  for no one doubts that a mechanic eats his lunch and can love his wife, but so for the philosopher?  An inversions of banal cliche is itself a way to perpetuate that very cliche that it wishes to problematize.  What is interesting is that the thin line the documentary takes on humanizing Derrida, it does not particularly do a good job at humanizing him and as I said about, Derrida's acute sense  of the camera makes the entire humanization seem forced.

Perhaps a biography of Derrida will correct this now that Derrida has pasted and more of his lectures are being published.  We shall see.",1341878400,,1656,4.91726618705036

8005209,5,B00011V872,"To begin where I saw this (since I do not own this yet) it was in my philosophy course after reading his ""Letter to a Japanese Friend.""

-------[Spoilers in what is said from here in.]

I honestly don't know Derrida or his life well enough to comment on what it is or isn't. Even if I did, Derrida would probably of rejected that idea as he stated within the movie ""as Aristotle once said, a philosophers life can be summed up in his birth, his belief, and his death.""

Though there are great grievances about Derrida in this film (felt ""Ozzy Osbourne"", uncomfortable in front of camera, young, inexperienced, etc.) I felt they did a relatively good job. It was interesting to say the least, and what is asked of the film is the same that Derrida himself states as irrelevant. In his relation he sticks with the ""superficial"" matters, and even the constant ""knowing the camera crew is there"" feeling of it adds to it. Derrida states that it is very artificial to begin with, almost coming off as film in general is artificial. Then someone suggested knowing more about his life, his work and all that. But within the film Derrida says that's the wrong way to go about anyone's biography. He says if you want to know the life of someone, taking all the information provided and creating a biography is the wrong way to go, and instead take a portion of what was written and expand there. Which is what the directors seemed to be trying to do. The entire ""felt young, inexperienced"" with constant showing of the camera crew and all that was there attempt to say to the audience, in my opinion, ""we know it's fake, we know what we are deriving is only a small portion of who he is, but we don't want you to forget that while watching this.""

The film felt like more of an attempt to tackle the idea of deconstructionism and what it is and how he works into it, then it was a documentary about Derrida. But don't get me wrong, some of the things stated within the flim felt foreign to my glorification of a philosopher. There is a point where he is asked ""this is your book collection?"" Or something along those lines and he answers yes, and they ask if he's read all these books and he says ""I've understood quite a bit. I've read three of four. But of those books, I read them very well.""
----------[END SPOILERS]

Overall, it's a movie I would recommend wanting to know more about Derrida on a almost personal level, but if all your interests lie in is facts, then look elsewhere. I enjoyed it, but one has to enter it with an open mind. So would I recommend it to everyone? No. Just a certain percentage of the people I've known.",1270598400,,2629,4.412371134020619
8005210,5,B00011V872,"Sure, this DVD is not Derrida speaking all the time about his major works, but there is a reason for that. It would be quite impossible to go over all of Derrida's work in a 80 minute film, however, all these conversations that Derrida has with the film makers, give a very important and interesting glimpse at how the man thinks about all things, his work often included. If you want a full blow out 'Derrida, ONLY works"", then read his books, this movie is part biography and part thought, plus the bonus material is quite good. Overall a very good film.",1266969600,5,556,4.46078431372549
8005211,2,B00011V872,"Let me begin by saying that Derrida's philosophy has influenced me above all others.  I am fascinated by his thinking, but this movie was a travesty.  I had hoped to see a film in which Derrida's thought would be expounded upon by the man himself.

This film failed on many levels.  The questions asked by the interviewers in awful French were juvenile.  You could see the great thinker's disgust with the artificiality and facile nature of the questions.  Derrida on more than one occasion attempted to make the question asked by the interviewer into a better, more philosophically relevant question before he answered.  The best example of this moment is when he was asked about ""love"" (amour).  Derrida, playfully asks the interview if she meant death (mort).  He then goes on to tell her that he cannot answer such a question. He then turns the question into a question about the nature of loving, whether one loves someone as an irreducible singularity or the aspects of that person.  Love then becomes a question and ""who"" and ""what"" and thus tied to questions of being.

Overall, thus film is a terrible.  It does however, despite its poor directing and frustration do reveal something about Derrida.  Though as Derrida remarks, it is a filmmakers edit of Derrida and not him himself.

I recommend it to persons interested in Derrida.  If you are not familiar with him and his thoughts, it will leave an ill picture of the man and his thought in your mind.",1262131200,3,1463,4.75
8005212,3,B00011V872,"Q: So what do you do with a guy who has challenged every philosophic assumption upon which the western thought-world is premised?

A: Film him putting jam on bread.

The filmakers can't decide whether they want to take a reverent look at this legendary philosopher & his unique contribution to western thought or whether they want to deconstruct him. What they decide to do is try to get Derrida to deconstruct himself, but their efforts are so transparent that they usually just put Derrida on the spot & in the awkward position of trying to be gracious to them and their fumbling crew while still defending his privacy.

To be fair to the filmakers, Derrida is the one who gives the filmakers the idea for this strategy when he comments on the tendency of western philosophers since Aristotle not to include details from their personal lives in their work, and, later, when he mentions that he would like to know about the sex lives of Husserl & Heidegger etc...
But, when asked these sorts of questions himself, Derrida refuses to reveal anything, so what we have here is a kind of cat & mouse game where the filmaker/interrogator attempts to trick Derrida into talking about something that he refuses to talk about, himself. To be fair to Derrida, however, one reason for this reluctance to talk about his personal relationships is a respect for the privacy of others, ie his wife & family. It is readily apparent that for Derrida there is a definite separation between what he perceives to be his professional responsibilites to the filmakers and to his public and what he perceives to be his personal responsibilities to his family and himself. But, in true Derridean fashion, the decision whether to speak or not to speak is forever deferred. Whether he speaks of it or not, however, it is  apparent that Derrida and his psychoanalyst wife, Marguerite, are extremely close and share a very intimate bond.  Even if Derrida is reluctant to discuss his personal life, we do get to observe that personal life firsthand.

So, although the get-Derrida-to-deconstruct-himself strategy doesn't exactly work, the documentary, nonetheless, does allow us unprecedented access to him and it allows us the freedom to take our own measure of the man based upon observation if not upon Derridean self-critique.

As far as autobiography goes, Derrida does talk about his Algerian youth & his expulsion from school for being a Jew, as well as his loathing of having to then go to a school exclusively for Jews. Judging by what Derrida says, it would seem that a certain self-distancing occured at this point in his life, and, although Derrida does not say so in this documentary, it was at this moment in his life that he began his study of western philosophy. This rare moment of openness certainly sheds some light on Derrida's way of theorizing absence/presence, self/other, origin/trace but the filmakers do not capitalize on Derrida's invitation & really miss an opportunity to get him to expound upon the relevance of his personal life to his work. Mostly what we get here is a very gracious Derrida, wife by his side, going about the business of being a lecturer and fielding questions from either the painfully uninformed (one American girl claims that she read one of his ""novels"" over the summer and wanted to see him in person so that she could better understand what she'd just read) or the boorishly informed (after Derrida gives a lecture in South Africa on the topic of ""forgiveness"" in which Derrida argues that true forgiveness is not possible because to forgive something is to say that that something is forgivable, one graduate student delivers her own mini-lecture on the topic). Going by the evidence of this documentary, the success of an academic (or at least the success of an academic celebrity) is largely determined by their capacity to suffer fools graciously. To his credit Derrida rarely loses his patience or temper with anyone. If nothing else, we do at least get to see that Jacques Derrida is a decent human being.

I think most viewers will rent this because they already have some knowledge of Derrida's way of thinking and are curious to see the man in action, but these viewers will most likely be disappointed as there are very few philosophical exchanges captured here. Derrida does improvise a bit on Narcissus & Echo, but before he really explores the full implications of the myth (in which he sees an autobiographical resemblance: ie Narcissus can only see himself & Echo cannot say anything original even though the sound of her voice alters the original iteration) he stops short, as if looking in a mirror and then, before the recognition can be registered, looking away. Its not clear whether he is resisting the image or refusing to share it. The (possible) meanings of the scene are easily lost however because the filmakers simply move on to the next scene. Its unclear whether the filmakers don't know what they have or whether they know very well and see no reason to underscore it. I don't think the filmakers can be faulted for this, its just that Derrida is a slippery presence & much more subtle than an obvious entertainer like Slavoj Zizek (who delivers his revelations like a comedian delivering punchlines). Unlike the grand showman Zizek, Derrida is at his most interesting when carefully negotiating the trespasses of thought with the written word. Derrida's preference for the written word over the spoken word is well known and so, not surprisingly, the most intriguing parts of this documentary-essay-portrait are the well-selected quotes from his many works.

I also suspect that we rent DVD's of thinkers like Derrida because we expect something to happen while he is being filmed. And nothing really does happen while he's being filmed, or not enough happens. Its not just that the filmakers lack an understanding of how best to use film & Derrida together, and not just that their questions are not particularly good ones (although both of these contribute to the overall blandness of this portrait), because they do film others asking Derrida questions as well and these questions also fail to get the kind of response that a curious public wants (even though the, often sardonic, answers that are provided will amuse Derrida devotees). For example, to her credit, one enthusiastic American intellectual tries to draw him into a discussion of Seinfeld's ironic universe and how everything on the show from kitchen cabinets to the existence of God is treated with equal gravity. Its a perfect set-up question for a philosopher-celebrity like Slavoj Zizek (the reigning champ of shoot-from-the-hip discourse) and one that Zizk would run with, but Derrida is not someone who cares about celebrity, nor is he someone who is prone to riff on a random topic, nor is he interested in the intersection of pop culture & poststructural philosophy in the way that Zizek is. The question just seems to annoy him. Ultimately, its hard to say whether its the filmakers (and the public's) fault for failing to understand their subject or if Derrida is simply not a very captivating subject (I suspect the problem is with the filmakers).

Though a select few will enjoy the subtleties of nuances of Derrida's attitude & ongoing critique of the proceedings, this is a portrait of a gentleman philosopher that really doesn't have much to recommend itself to a general viewership, other than the fact that it is the only one available on DVD. It should be mentioned that Derrida does have a small 5 minute part in a movie that he co-wrote called Ghost Dance in which he plays himself talking about ghosts--he thinks of himself as one--and cinema. Though its only a brief cameo appearance, Ghost Dance does understand how best to use film & Derrida together.

In one of the excerpts from his works, Derrida is quoted as saying that the self is visible to others but not visible to the self. The question I would have liked to ask at this point is whether he glimpses his self while reading his own work (even though Derrida often says that the self is never at one with itself it would be interesting to know if he recognizes himself in his discursive traits & style). Readers of Derrida's work know him as a textual ""presence"" or, in Derridean lingo, they know him as an ""absence"" and he fosters, as well as parodies, this image of himself as a kind of ghostly aura haunting the interstices of various discourses, literary & philosophic, looking for an originary presence (deity, logos, self) where, most likely, there is none to be found (strangely enough, the topic of religion never comes up). Ideally, of course, a philosopher's actual presence is valuable to the extent that the reader can ask questions of the philosopher and engage him in a lively debate as well as correct their own misreadings & misunderstandings (a particularly acute problem with Derrida's writing which has been called ""obscure"" even by his former teacher & friend Michael Foucault). For this reason it would be an excellent idea to archive the lectures & seminars (along with the papers) of great academics like Derrida. I'm sure that this will begin happening very soon. Imagine what it would be like to watch Derrida deliver one of his famous papers like 1966's ""Structure, Sign, Play in the Discourses of the Human Sciences"" or to watch him engage in one of his many heated exchanges with fellow academics. But this isn't what is captured here. After watching this DVD, my impression is that the best of Derrida is in print, and Derrida seems to think this as well. His advice to the woman who attempts to parse post-structuralism with Seinfeld or vice versa is to stop watching sit-coms and pick up a book. I am guessing that, were he still alive, his advice to potential viewers of this DVD would be to put down the DVD and pick up a book.

Not an ideal portrait, but a few interesting moments will make it worthwhile for the attentive reader.",1218412800,5,9971,4.851938895417156

"" [...] the so called Cinema Verite is devoid of verite. It reaches a merely superficial truth, the truth of accountants."" (Werner Herzog, Proposition 1--Minnesota Declaration: April 30, 1999).

""This film, in the end will be more about the film makers than about Derrida.""

The film is 'edgy' enough to feel contrived, and superficial enough to be marketable. Derrida, despite itself, comes through the holes in the sails with strong wind. The banality almost adds to it, as contrast. What would have been preferable may have been the interviews uncleaved in their entirety, but that is not what is given. To prove the impossibility of making an adequate film as such, somehow Zeitgeist studies finds it appropriate to film a 'tribute' despite the axiomatic acceptance of mediocrity and inadequacy. The film in-itself is too self-aware to get beyond itself. They film scenes of Derrida watching sequences just played to the viewer, and his response. The camera man has the professional qualifications of a home movie grip. Although they seem to have trapped the man himself within the horizon of the motion picture, as far as documenting his thought on camera, this remains elusive. The narration of Derrida quotes, combined with the soundtrack circa 'Apocalypse Now'-meets ""World"" music makes the viewer fear for the impending murder or disappearance of Derrida over the course of the film. The woman's dictation of the quotes is eerie enough on its own, and frighteningly boring; one is impressed with the idea that a person hearing the narration alone and out of context would believe he was listening to a pseudo-science cult indoctrination film.

From the unanswered questions, the comments and the face impressions, I just thought that Derrida was incredibly bored and yet amused at Kirby. Also, the questions asked by Kirby were too...high school? And too broad.

Kirby tries to turn the tables on Derrida and ""deconstruct him"" by showing each of the facets of a man and that he is a man, just like the rest of us.

The movie is itself supposed to show how it is impossible to really do a movie like the one it's apparently supposed to be. I don't know that I learned anything though.

The film has excerpts of Derrida's text read to us as music plays and we watch various scenes. Whatever these are to mean, undoubtedly most people will not be sure. I wasn't looking for just a lecture, but was hoping to experience in this unprecedented glimpse at the famous philosopher some more light cast on his difficult ideas.
