8430611,2,B004ICDLA2,"I have been using this video in the early evening during kidney time (5- 7 pm. standard time). I have noticed in an increase in my energy from this daily practice. The video is simple to follow and not long and complex. I would highly recommend this video for anyone with Kidney Energy issues (as described in Traditional Chinese Medicine) I have only been working on this several weeks so I will need to follow up. There is some disparity between what sound the Master is saying and the translator. I just try to copy his sounds. It could also be improved for English speaking audiences by lowering the Master speaking Chinese and allowing the translator to speak over him. Of course, his may be a wider audience of both Chinese and English speakers. This is not a crucial aspect.

After using this DVD for over a month, I quit. I have been using Matthews Cohen's DVD's on Qigong. I bought his DVD here on Amazon. His style is easy to follow and definitely increases vital energy and health. Master Zhang's style on his DVD became difficult to follow. His style is much more visually oriented. I am not so good visually. Also his voice was not soothing and it was difficult to concentrate day after day using his video. I have the opposite affect with Matthew Cohen's video. I never feel that I will be glad when it is over. If you need a less visual style of Qigong, then I would not recommend 5 Element Qigong Water by Master Zhang.",1377993600,3,1457,4.50188679245283
