8256434,5,B0014VPFUO,My granddaughter wanted the 3 tapes on hoopla.  She can't watch them often enough. I bought her a portable DVD player so she didn't have to wait for a an available TV in the house. She loves them.,1410739200,,196,4.157894736842105
8256435,5,B0014VPFUO,"Hopla is so sweet, and our toddler is entranced by it. The makers of this series understand how children learn... and the focus is on learning... so none of the attention-deficit-inspiring zip and flash of some other shows directed at kids.",1333324800,,240,4.878048780487805
8256436,5,B0014VPFUO,"My son loved Hopla. Started watching it at 3mos through 2yrs Very educational.  Teaches then colors, shapes and creativity.",1305504000,2,123,5.473684210526316
8256437,5,B0014VPFUO,"This is a cutesy first DVD to keep your child's attention.  I bought this because it was featured at the end of his Word World DVD and he just loved seeing this little rabbit jumping around and started pointing and telling me what stuff was.

My son is 2 now and still loves it and it also holds the attention of my older niece's and nephew's as well.",1298764800,,351,4.147058823529412
8256438,5,B0014VPFUO,"My 2-year old loves to watch Hopla before going to bed. We watch it together and name all the animals and things we see.  My daughter learned a lot of new words this way.  We are raising her bilingual.  Since the video does not have any words, it is convenient to narrate it and discuss it in any language.",1284249600,,306,4.1525423728813555
8256439,5,B0014VPFUO,"My daughter has been watching Hopla since she was 2 months old. We were introduced to them free through our Netflix subscription and absolutely fell in love. I've heard the warnings about exposing babies to TV very early, but here's why Hopla works for us:

1 - Each DVD is broken down into 5 minute segments, with 10 segments total. Each segment has a ""beginning"" and an ""end"" so you know where to pause when your child has seen enough. We watch Hopla before nap time and sometimes one segment is enough. If she's awake and happy watching, then we continue with one more segment. Now at 9 months old, my daughter and I wave hello and goodbye at the beginnings and ends so she knows when the segment ends.

2 - Each segment has 4 or 5 ""skits"". Some are puzzles, or a short story of bunny and some of his pals. They are so well done and slow enough to allow you to give your baby vocabulary or narrate what's going on.

3 - The melodies are wonderful! Some are cheerful, some are ""sleepytime"" music, and others are simply charming. As a matter of fact, my husband put Hopla on our little Ipod and when we take longer trips in the car, we play it and our daughter just listens to the music without seeing the video portion.

In my opinion, there is no reason why you couldn't use Hopla with small babies and let them grow up with it. Use it appropriately as a learning tool with your guidance, and use it as something that they become familiar with and enjoy. If you only want to start with one DVD, start with this one Hopla: Let's go.",1267488000,,1534,4.279310344827586
8256440,5,B0014VPFUO,"Hopla is terrific.  It's my little niece and nephew's favorite new  series.  They are 3 and 4, and they just LOVE these DVDs.  They get so excited about all of the matching games and their favorite is the ""predicting"" parts.  (An object slowly starts to form and gives the kids ""clues.""  My kiddos go crazy yelling out guesses while the object materializes.  So fun!)
I wish there were more of them!!",1220745600,,400,4.549295774647887
