Getting Started on Congas: Technique for One and Two Drums"" is one of the best videos on the market for learning Congas. The reason is, Bobby gives very clear explanation of the rhythms by slowing it down how the pattern is played with good camera shots of the hands. This video is for an advance player already familiar with different Conga strokes, like open, slap, bass and heel toe. You have the Tumbao, Guaguanco, and Bembe broken down by different drum parts in an ensemble situation plus how to play the rhythms on two and three Congas. I was especially impressed with Boby Sanabria's demonstration of how to played the Patato Tumbao and Bembe on three Congas. The Candido interview and performance in itself worth the price of this video. Every Conga drummer should have this video! It's really a shame this is not available on DVD?",1268784000,2,923,4.775
7863405,4,6304159242,"Bobby Sanabria's ""Getting Started on Congas 1 & 2"" is one of the better conga instructional videos available. He uses a bilingual approach, but both English and Spanish speakers should find the instructions easy to follow. He translates from English to Spanish while demonstrating each lesson which can be a bit cumbersome but worth the effort.

  This tape is the second in a series of three by Sanabria: ""Conga Basics"", ""Getting Started...1 & 2"", and ""Getting Started...2 & 3"". His method of teaching is patient enough for beginners and informative enough for the more serious player. Each video builds on the previous one so, for best results, the entire set is recommended. However, if you are at least acquainted with conga drums, this is a good place to start. The tapes take you through a history of conga drumming, body and hand positions for obtaining the basic tones, and some basic tumbaos and cierres (rhythms and breaks) as well as how to play with the clave, which is common to virtually all types of latin music. His style is relaxed and encouraging. The tapes end with Sanabria and his band playing a song. Then the song is repeated for ""play-along"" practice. All in All, one of the best teaching tapes for conga that I've seen. (Worth 4.5 stars)",1064102400,22,1262,4.779816513761468
