8315570,5,B001KNSRRO,Truly eye-opening video to see what happens to typically trained gunfighters at close range with simulated knives.  You see the problem through Force-on-Force drills and then get the solution to the close range knife problem.  Aptly named DVD because this material could definitely save your life.,1320192000,,297,5.434782608695652
