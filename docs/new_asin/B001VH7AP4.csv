But I'm sure it would have been an awfully expensive school as most TM products are.",1270339200,3,247,4.391304347826087
8346425,3,B001VH7AP4,"I would like to see a review from someone outside the movement.
No need to wear emerald glasses like the Wizard of Oz or something.
 Does everyone really flourish, getting all A's and winning all the athletic contests?
 I don't think that is realistic.",1253750400,2,252,4.704545454545454
8346426,5,B001VH7AP4,"I loved watching and listening to these children. There are also talks by Dr. George Rutherford and other educators and administrators who have implemented practice of the Transcendental Meditation technique in their schools during designated quiet times. The results are quite remarkable.

I highly recommend this video to parents, teachers, and administrators. It presents important information for today's education and dispels possible misunderstanding about meditation in schools.",1249084800,5,485,6.2388059701492535

I'd be much more impressed by a film that shows what's really going on out there.

The TM people say that they want to achieve world peace by teaching everyone TM, but then they want $2500 out of you first, for about 4 hours of instruction, with little or no overhead.  I don't know if the price has gone up by now as i was out in Fairview about 3 or 4 years ago.  In Mexico it costs $600 (or thereabouts).  Why?  Because they feel they can get more money out of Americans.

So they basically wouldn't let me be a part of world peace because I didn't have the money.  Their recruiter asked if I myself taught anything.  I told him that I tutor math.  He challenged, what would I do if  student couldn't pay?  I told him that I often tutored poor students for free, it was never an issue, my only qualification was a desire to learn on the student's behalf, no matter how much money they had.

Well, the Maharishi needed my money still.  You see, he was raising the money to bring together the top 13 or so meditators in the world (why it costs so much to bring them together was never explained) and then these guys, once meditating together would bring about world peace.

Isn't elitism beautiful?  World peace will come about without your participation, because you're just not good enough.  How do they know this?  I don't know, just some special powers they have tell them so.  You wouldn't understand.  Although the TM'ers never seemed to question this so perhaps once you learn TM it all becomes clear, and I'm just not yet enlightened enough to understand?

One TM'er also told me that if he came up with $8,000 they would teach him to ""fly.""  That's why the locals of Fairview, IA, lovingly refer to them as the ""flyers.""

Oh, if only I had enough money to be a part of world peace... or if I had enough to learn to fly!  That would be a beautiful thing!

I wonder if they can teach invisibility too?  That would be cool!

David Lynch is my favorite filmmaker, but I'm not too crazy about the TM people who come off to me as scammers.

I'd like to see them address the points that I have brought up.  They might try with vague double talk, but I've never been able to get straight answers out of them.",1245196800,13,2285,4.285714285714286
8346428,5,B001VH7AP4,"Thank you for checking out SCHOOL OF THOUGHT with David Lynch.  You can see the first eight-minutes of this documentary  for free at:  [...] .

When I first met the students at the Maharishi Schools, I was blown away by their confidence, intelligence and presence.  They know that happiness is the key to a harmonious, stress-free school and that through Transcendental Meditation, they become calmer, more focused and have more energy.  I saw this first-hand and wanted to share what I discovered with anyone who was interested in helping to create a more peaceful world.

The film has been selling out Film Festivals everywhere when it first premiered in November, 2008.  It is still making the rounds through all of 2009.  I attended some of the screenings and really enjoyed the comments and questions during the Q and A.  People had no idea this school existed and many wanted to learn meditation right then and there for themselves and/or their children.  Very cool.

I am not associated with the Maharishi Schools and learned TM during the research for the making of SCHOOL OF THOUGHT.  Now that's research that has stayed with me and continues to make my life fuller and richer in ways that I could never imagine.  - T",1237075200,5,1226,4.776190476190476
