6590255,5,B00MNCVW8C,Very Good Movie!,1426550400,2,16,4.666666666666667
6590256,4,B00MNCVW8C,"Not a movie for everyone because of the content. At the same time, it will definitely draw you in if you want to see an odd-looking, really good kid get taken advantage of because of some circumstances, many prejudices and a dumb mistake, this one will do it. Connor Jessup does an awesome characterization that will win you over.",1419724800,4,330,4.610169491525424
6590257,5,B00MNCVW8C,"This movie was riveting and stuck with me. Alternately satisfying, heartbreaking, and frustrating. If you like movies with multi-faceted characters in a nuanced and unconventional story, this is for you.",1419638400,3,203,5.8
8673179,1,B00MNCVW8C,Nobody in this story appeared to have more than two functioning brain cells.,1510876800,,76,4.923076923076923
8673180,4,B00MNCVW8C,This movie was really good and  I would have rated it a 5 stars except the way it ended was so crappy that it pissed me off.,1501372800,,124,3.5925925925925926
8673181,5,B00MNCVW8C,"Emotionally charged... very real portrayal of the inner pain and struggles of the abuses children may grow with. touched on several different areas of abuse, fear and needing a real connection to cope..",1492819200,,202,5.151515151515151
8673182,3,B00MNCVW8C,"I watched this film for only one reason - Connor Jesspup. I've been VERY impressed by the honesty of his ""acting""! Here, again, he is wonderful. For me, and the reason I gave this film only three stars, the story seemed to miss great, golden opportunities to address the issues that was the heart of the story; the ramifications of posting threats, whether intended or not, to any of the social media outlets, and the effects of bullying. In addition, the ending was like a tire going flat, it just deflated and became flat. Those things notwithstanding, the film did keep my attention, so I don't consider it a waste of time. It's just that it could have been so much better.",1485302400,3,676,4.549180327868853
8673183,4,B00MNCVW8C,Would watch again. A pretty decent movie.,1468627200,,41,5.0
8673184,5,B00MNCVW8C,"I thought it was great. Connor Jessup is very talented. It was a different take on the school shooting subject. I loved that his father supported him. Although the court proceedings against Jessup's character and prosecution seemed unlikely and simplistic, it was an interesting little film and a testament to the power of the human spirit.",1464220800,,340,5.089285714285714
8673185,5,B00MNCVW8C,"Great movie that illustrates the dangers of social media. Everything posted online can be scrutinized and interpreted however people want. The movie also makes a statement that shows how someone dresses or presents themselves doesn't make them bad or dangerous. To be fair, the panic of the community regarding perceived threats of violence on students should not be taken lightly. Connor Jessup does an amazing job of portraying the main character.",1455321600,2,449,5.338028169014085

8673187,2,B00MNCVW8C,"This movie was utterly pointless. I like Connor Jessup, but this movie and his performance were painful to watch. The pacing is really slow and I found myself looking at my watch with about 49 minutes to go. The actor who played the father was pretty dreadful. Sean's (Jessup) ""girlfriend"" was annoying and vapid. I don't understand why Sean continues to be motivated in pursuing a relationship with someone who is at the center of his troubles and conflicts. In other words, she's not really a likeable person.

There are moments throughout the film where nothing is really developing in a way that keeps the viewer engaged and interested. During these times I really felt my attention slipping away. Overall, the plot of the movie is somewhat believable, I just don't think it was developed enough to really create an entertaining film. And I think this is mostly due to a fairly weak script and poor directing. Lastly, I would not recommend buying, or even renting this movie, especially not at the rental price of $3.99.  I would suggest waiting until it's available for free on prime.",1430438400,,1089,4.818181818181818
