This film is so good that it should be a part of every Christmas, along with 'It's a Wonderful Life'. ""Truce In the Forest"" (produced by the Baptist Sunday School Board and reviewed now by a Mormon) I believe is unquestionably one of the best short films ever made. (Not just an idle comment. I spent a good part of my life in motion pictures on both sides of the screen and I am now 77 years old.) This is a true story from the Battle of the Bulge in World War 11.

Soldiers who were killing each other in the war were accidentally brought together on Christmas Eve and spent the night together in a Germain farm house. Through that Holy Night, and through the miracle of service wherein a German medic removes a bullet from an American soldier to save his life, men who were mortal enemies and killing each other just hours before, came to feel an unbelievable love for each other. Remarkable but true. We learn from this well crafted, magnificent, true motion picture 'Truce in the Forest' that we can even love our enemies, if we serve them and do good to them.

If the belief (taught by Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount) that we can even love our enemies by serving them, seems too simplistic, we need to know that the doctrine of loving our enemies is a belief that separates Christianity from all of the other World's great religions.

We should love those with a different point of view and even our enemies. As difficult as this seems, it can be done by doing good for those we dislike and then praying for them. This lesson taught by Jesus escapes most Christians even to this day. When have you ever heard a prayer for Al Qaeda, the Taliban, Hamas, Hezbollah, or for Muslim Terrorists?  Have you ever heard a prayer asking Heavenly Father to heal the enmity between Ishmael and Isaac (between Islam, Judaism, and Christanity)?

Man will not change and the world will never become a better place unless we learn this lesson about loving our enemies. To become the children of our Father in Heaven (see Matthew 5:43-48), we must return good for evil and replace hate with love or face the destruction of mankind. Indeed,loving our enemies is the way we become like God. After Jesus tells us to love our enemies and tells us how we can create love even for our enemies, He says, ""Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect."" Would Jesus admonish us to do anything that is not possible?

7788105,5,0570088933,"""Though the death and destruction of the infamous Battle of the Bulge threaten just outside her door, Gerta is determined that she and her daughter will take time to remember and celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. When two American soldiers ask her to hide them and help their injured friend, she cannot refuse them. Her love for Christ compels her to protect and care for them despite the risks. Only hours later, German soldiers appear at the door seeking shelter and rest after a long day's search for the American infiltrators. Gerta finds herself faced with a horrible dilemma -- she won't sacrifice the lives of the Americans but she cannot turn the Germans away either. Trusting in God, Gerta bravely confronts this potentially explosive situation. She appeals to the soldiers to forget their differences and lay down their weapons in the name of Jesus. Can these weary soldiers put aside their weapons and work together to overcome their fears, hatred, and injuries? Will they learn to care for each other enough to join in honoring the Savior's birth?"" [From back of box.]",1192320000,4,1083,4.891304347826087
