8291656,3,B001D5C1OY,"Although this is supposed to be a classic steamy horror film, I found it to be too confusing and randomly edited to really satisfy.  It has it moments, but doesn't really deliver.  I gave it one extra star for the quality of the camera-work and the production values",1441411200,,266,4.520833333333333
8291657,4,B001D5C1OY,"Though this film, Watcher in the Attic, has received a lot of critical lambaste, I was really surprised by how well made it was. First of all, I love Rampo Edogawa novels. I thought his novel ""Japanese Tales of Mystery and Imagination"" was amazing, plus this is one of the few films where even though his character is the villain of sorts, his character is still sympathetic. In 1923 Tokyo the landlord of a boarding house spys on those dwelling below beneath his roof.

Though almost all of the characters excluding Minako Sayanomiya/Saburo Gouda and the landlord are two dimensional, it doesn't really hamper the film since it works best as a glimpse into the landlord's tortured and torturous life.

If you're a Rampo Edogawa fan, then you immediately need to get this.",1386547200,,772,4.796992481203008
