8473118,4,B005HIBW84,"There's some sort of plot out there in this poverty row musical. Mostly it's an excuse of some pleasant enough, upbeat tunes, a fun enough group of actors, a short enough movie, and nothing too taxing. It kills an hour with no great strain.",1490140800,,240,4.4772727272727275

8473122,4,B005HIBW84,"not a bad print, considering the vintage. The music is good, and Gale Storm sings her little heart out. The requisite college hi-jinks are very camp, so bad, they are good! I also enjoyed glimpses of the old Monogram studio which served as a stand in for a college campus, and of bits of UCLA buildings, which are still standing today. Nostalgia is my thing! Bring on the musicals, please!",1405900800,,389,4.571428571428571
8473123,3,B005HIBW84,"Those familiar with Monogram Pictures are aware that the scrappy Poverty Row studio had built its rep on its hard-nosed B-noir thrillers, and them rowdy East Side Kids, and on its B-westerns (a chunk of which featured some up-and-comer named John Wayne). Back in the day, Monogram harbored aspirations of becoming a major player and so took time to create and nurture its own catalogue of stars (remember the British Olympic figure skater, Belita? No?). Well, Monogram showcased Gale Storm in crime dramas like Foreign Agent (1942) and Cosmo Jones, Crime Smasher (1943), and in comedies like G.I. Honeymoon (1945), and in musicals like Rhythm Parade (1942), Nearly Eighteen (1943) and in this one, Campus Rhythm (also 1943). So those who'd only ever delighted to Gale Storm in her 1950s TV sitcom ""My Little Margie,"" well, you're in for a treat because she very much had a silver screen career before her stint on television.

In Campus Rhythm she plays Joan Abbott, an underaged radio songbird nicknamed the ""Crunch-Wunchy Thrush"" after the program's breakfast cereal sponsor. Joan is popular enough that she draws in twenty million listeners and the station is rarin' to renew her contract. But here's the rub: Joan has been in show business all her life, has supported herself and her spineless uncle/guardian/agent (Douglas Leavitt) all her life. She's only ever attended school in snatches; she's missed out on fun activities like sororities and proms and, oh yeah, book learnin'. Joan's been looking forward to enrolling in college once her contract expires. But her uncle owes five grand to the station's top brass. He extends her contract without her consent.

A furious Joan tears away, escaping to modest Rowley College under the pseudonym ""Susie Smith."" There, she begins to live her college dream, rubbing elbows with her sorority sisters and getting mired in a love triangle with the easy-going college band leader (Robert Lowery) and the stuffystudent editor (Johnny Downs). It's all good in the 'hood until the station launches a national campaign to root her out.

It's a campus musical and runs around an hour long. I rate it 3 out of 5 stars mostly on the strength of Gale Storm's being in it. Campus Rhythm coasts on very light material, bolstered by comic relief courtesy of the expressive GeGe Pearson and Candy Candido whose novelty act (froggy voice) may occasionally wear thin. I thought Robert Lowery was charming but didn't care at all for Johnny Downs as he comes off as this insufferable snob. Sadly, the songs - and there's a bunch of 'em - are forgettable, although I did like Gale's renditions of ""Walkin' the Chalk Line"" and ""But Not You."" Her singing voice is sweet and natural, and I'm only surprised that it took until the 1950s before she landed a record deal. What strikes me strongest about Gale Storm is that she brings an effortlessly classy, down-to-earth presence. The crazy campus shenanigans are made more palatable merely because she's in the room, generating class and stability and good common sense. She's good at selling believability. She just about validates the movie.",1394323200,,3120,5.007707129094412
8473124,4,B005HIBW84,"From 1931 through 1953, Monogram Pictures Corporation was known to create films in Hollywood on low budgets.  But from their films, there were a few that became big stars.

One of those stars was a singer named Gale Storm, once an actress for RKO Radio Pictures, but when she moved onto Monogram Pictures, although not a big name in Hollywood, because of her musical vocals and her acting, she would catch the attention of moviegoers.

One of those films from Monogram Pictures that would showcase the up-and-coming starlet was the 1943 ""Campus Rhythm"" and from then on, after several films later, she would become an American icon in the 1950's, starring in the TV series ""My Little Margie"" (which lasted from 1952-1955) and then her own show, ""The Gale Storm Show"" which aired from 1965-1960.

While probably known for the Monogram Pictures film ""Swing Parade of 1946', there is no denying that her talent as an actress had gotten better since making her acting debut in 1940.

And the film ""Campus Rhythm"" has been selected for release under Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's ""Limited Edition Collection"" which is the company's MOD (Made-on-Demand) series, similar to Warner Bros. has done with Warner Archive and Sony's Columbia Classics.

The films do not have special features, nor have they been remastered, fixed-up or gone through any expensive restoration work.  If anything, a lot of these films are targeted to a nice group of movie fans and collectors and are typically not the big giant titles that movie studios would want to promote.

And because Monogram Pictures films were low-budget films and the fact that interest in classic Hollywood is waning, fortunately, there is a niche group of movie fans, such as myself who value these films, high-budget or low-budget, just the opportunity to watch them brings happiness to us.

But with that being said, because these films are not sold for cheap and are sold typically under $20 with no special features and nothing but the film, this group expects a good print with no major problems with the disc.

So, before I go with my review for ""Campus Rhythm"", the question many will want to know first is... ""Does it play?"".  I played this DVD on my Sony PlayStation 3 with no problems whatsoever.  No stalling, no shadowing, no errors.  It played perfectly.

As for the film, ""Campus Rhythm"" begins with popular NYC radio singer Joan Abbot (played by Gale Storm) performing.  But while she is singing, which is supposed to be her last performance for her sponsor, company owner, J.P. Hartman (played by Herbert Heyes) wants to resign Joan under a new sponsor for six months.

But her Uncle Willy (played by Douglas Leavitt), who has power of attorney over Joan doesn't think it will happen.  But because he owns Hartman $5,000, Hartman tells him that he has two choices, to pay the $5,000 back or if not, he can go to jail...unless he signs Joan to a new 6-month sponsorship deal.

So, Uncle Willy has no choice and signs the contract without consulting Joan.

When Joan finds out, she is livid.  She has been saving her money to go to a college because all she has done during her young life is perform and now it's time for her to get away from the business and go to college.  Of course, Hartman reveals what is at stake for her Uncle Willy.

While upset about the situation, when she runs into Hartman's secretary Susie Smith (played by Marie Blake), Susie tells her about graduating high school and having dreams to go to college.  And immediately, Joan gets an idea.  Why not leave and go to a college under a different name...Susie Smith.

So, Joan...now going by the name of Susie Smith enrolls at Raleigh College and the first person she meets is Buzz O'Hara (played by Robert Lowery, who would later play Bruce Wayne/Batman in the 1949 serial), who is smitten with her.  But with the big dance coming up and already having a date, he tries to get his bass player Harold (played by the well known radio performer, bass player Candy Candido) to bring her to the dance, but Harold is dating Babs and the only one that Harold can think of bringing Susie to the dance is the school reporter and frump frat member ""Scoop"" Davis (played by ""Our Gang"" star Johnny Downs).

The first meeting between Scoop and Susie was not that great because he perceives her as your regular girl just wanting to be with any guy but when she starts taking interest in journalism, he begins to warm up to her.

Meanwhile, sorority member Cynthia Walker (played by Claudia Drake) is not so thrilled that Susie is getting the attention of Buzz and the guys.  So, she starts to look at Susie with disdain.

While Susie is enjoying college life at Raleigh, in NYC, her Uncle and J.P. Hartman are stressing out because Joan Abbott left and worry they will lose their sponsors and radio listeners.  So, knowing that she wanted to go to college, they come up with an idea by having a release printed in newspapers across the country that the popular singer Joan Abbott has attended college and a ""Crunchy Wunchy Thrush"" contest if one can write in of what college that Joan has attended, and it turns out to be true, they can be a winner.

Needless to say, Susie Smith becomes popular among the men and women at college but when she shows her musical and singing skills, she becomes to go to gal!

And hearing her voice, Cynthia Walker who has read the article on Joan Abbot wonders if Susie Smith is actually her, going to college with an assumed name.  And because Cynthia is so jealous of her, she decides to enter the contest and notify J.P. and Uncle Willy that Joan Abbott is possibly attending Raleigh College.

MOD PLAYABILITY:

Part of the worry of viewers who had bad experiences with MOD DVD's are the printing quality.  There are some who can't get them to play and are literally now just coasters.

With ""Campus Rhythm"", its printed quite well with printing on top of the DVD, it's not a plain silver disc with letters.  If you didn't know it was MOD, you would think it was an actual DVD release.

As for playability, I played it on my Sony PlayStation 3 with no problems.  I then played it on my Mac, no problems whatsoever.  .

VIDEO AND AUDIO:

As far as picture quality goes, the film has been manufactured using the best source available.  But its important to remember that Monogram Pictures Corporation films were created with a low budget and these films have not gone through any major restoration.  With that being said, you can see the dust and scratches on the film, as well as mild flickering but other than that, the film is watchable and I personally had no problems watching this film, considering some Monogram Pictures films that I have seen were also not in the greatest shape, but compared to those films, ""Campus Rhythm"" is watchable, no blurring, no ghosting.  Just scratches and dust.

As for audio, only in the beginning of the film's opening credits is where the audio sounds its worst, with a lot of crackle but after those credits are over, the majority of the film sounds good.  Dialogue and music is clear and had no problems after the opening credits.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

MOD's or Video on Demand DVD's most often don't carry special features.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Charming, fun and hilarious, ""Campus Rhythm"" is a short 1940's film that showcases the talent of Gale Storm, before she became the American 1950's TV icon.

""Campus Rhythm"" has elements of what people enjoyed back in 1940.  Young adults in college, having a good time.  There is plenty of music and also cool dancing showcased in the film.  But for those of us who grew up with the young adult, college 1980's frat films... ""Campus Rhythm"" is quite interesting as you can see how frat and sororities were displayed in American cinema back then.

Although Monogram Pictures was known for its action films, for a short time, they knew how to entice viewers with music and dance and this film surely displays that.  Gale Storm has a beautiful voice and the music throughout the film is actually quite entertaining and fun.  And possibly the most hilarious part of the film is seeing Candy Candido play the role of Harold.

Candido is known for his low voice, but in the film, he talks with a super high voice, which changes to a normal voice and then to a very low voice.  It's his signature voice that made him a star and I just found his scenes so funny and his songs so hilarious to listen to.

Granted, the film is quite short at 61-minutes long and of course, it is a bit farfetched as a popular radio singer would be able to attend college without one recognizing her, but once again, it's a low-budget film and you can only hope the overall film is good and I can easily say that I had a fun time watching it!

And you also have other fun supporting actors in the film, from future talent Johnny Downs and Robert Lowery who would go on to big things.  Also, one of the few films starring veteran radio actress Gege Pearson who is best known on ""The Red Skeleton Show"" as Sara Drew back in 1945.  Everyone in this film contributed to the overall fun of the film.

Granted, none of these talents were huge stars at the time, but as mentioned earlier, that is what I love about watching classic Monogram Pictures because there are a lot of films that are actually enjoyable gems.  And part of the fun with ""Campus Rhythm"" is its music, dance and crazy characters.  The storyline is also quite enjoyable and for the most part, I had a great time watching this film.  Even my eight-year-old who watched was having fun and laughing at Candy Candido's voice whenever he spoke.

Overall, ""Campus Rhythm"" is an enjoyable Gale Storm film.  If you are a big fan of her, ""My Little Margie"", ""Swing Parade of 1946' or just looking for a fun comedy from the early '40s, I recommend ""Campus Rhythm"" a try!

And for those who are open to watching Hollywood low-budget films, in this case, a Monogram Pictures comedy, just because it's not made by a major studio doesn't mean it's terrible.  In fact, I'll go far to say that this is one of those rare low-budget gems from the past and call it a ""popcorn comedy"", I had an enjoyable time watching it!",1335571200,5,10167,4.6171396772398445
