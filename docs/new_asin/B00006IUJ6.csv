1777629,5,B00006IUJ6,"Masterful work of Italian neo-realism by the grand old man, Roberto Rossellini and filmed in war-torn Berlin and widely regarded as the precursor to Rossellini's 50's masterpieces.

A young boy is manipulated by his teacher who later turns out to be an appalling Nazi sympathizer who manipulates the boy into murdering his father.

Mesmerizing and always stylized and breathtaking form. This film conveys the horror and destructive inevitability of war far better than the gross Hollywood extravaganza's of the Longest Day variety.

Rossellini was criticized by the neo-realists for injecting greater melodrama and lighting control than was though appropriate, but the film still exists in a magnificent documentary style, and it runs circles around DeSica's Umberto D.",1137283200,4,769,5.555555555555555

I have seen them all these in the last two months and I can tell you with all the possible objectivity. This is another magisterial masterpiece of the Italian Realism. There is no way out along this struggling and gradually increasing tension. A true slap in the face that will make you think around a lot of things.

The image quality is so wretched, so absolutely horrendous, that it makes watching this masterpiece of a film quite literally impossible. The pixellation, at times, eats up not just individual shots, but entire sequences of the picture.

Actually, I've long found that a number of DVDs from Image Entertainment have this problem. Ecstasy (by Machaty) suffers from it as well.

It should not be legal to sell a disc whose image quality is this atrocious. I'm aghast that the company can even stay in business if they are marketing pieces of garbage like this DVD release.

Bottom line: Germania Anno Zero is a magnificent film. But avoid buying it on DVD and shoot for the VHS instead. Only that edition is watchable.",1116633600,36,795,4.664285714285715
1777632,5,B00006IUJ6,"Some of the greatest movies of all-time have the ability to make us care about their characters as if they were real human beings. We forget they are only characters, we forget it's only a movie.

 I've always said the greatest movie I've ever seen was ""The Bicycle Thief"" because it, more than any other movie, displayed the passion I'm talking it. The first time I saw that movie I was amazed. I had not seen many movies that could touch me in such a way. The only one that may have come close was Bergman's ""Wild Strawberries"".

 All of these feelings resurfaced again as I watch Roberto Rossellini's ""Germany Year Zero"" easily one of the greatest films I have ever seen. All of the emotion, the human drama needed to make a great film is here.

 This was the first Rossellini film I had seen at the time, since then I have seen ""Open City"", ""Paisan"", and ""Voyage in Italy"", but none of them seemed to touch me and provoke the power I thought this film had.

 The movie is set after WW2 as a family tries to get by and rebuild their lives. A young boy, Edmund (Edmund Moeschke) feels it is up to him to provide for the family since his father is dying, his brother may be wanted for war crimes, and his sister, he suspects has become a ""working girl"".

 They way these events are played out, the way Rossellini presents these characters to us our hearts have to go out to them. I was completely absorb while watching this film hopefully many more will feel the same way I do about this masterpiece.

 Bottom-line: Easily one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. A masterpiece by Roberto Rossellini. He is able to make the viewer forget it's only a movie us our hearts go out to the characters.",1096502400,16,1704,4.3575949367088604
1777633,4,B00006IUJ6,"GERMANIA ANNO ZERO is a film made in the Neo-Realist tradition by the Neo-Realist master Roberto Rossellini. It tells the simple but powerful story of Edmund - a boy trying to survive between the ruins of Berlin right after WWII. His family is as ruined as the city he lives in: his father is confined to a bed, his older brother fears prosecution for his Nazi past and his sister is a prostitute. Just like everybody else, Edmund manages to get some money from selling the things he finds here and there on the ruins; until one day he runs into his old school teacher: an old man who still preaches the Nazi ideology and defends the elimination of the weak. Influenced by those ideas, Edmund poisons his own father.
This is a powerful film that shows like no other the horrors of war (and the Nazi insanity) that inevitably destroy the lives of the ordinary inhabitants of the city. Rossellini, with his keen eye for detail (and his unique taste in composition), makes an impressive portrait of a chaotic city of empty ruins and basic survival.
GERMANIA ANNO ZERO is the third and final film in Rossellini's famous Neo-Realist war trilogy and is as strong and poignant as the others: OPEN CITY (ROMA CITT APERTA) and PAISAN (PAIS).
...On the down side, this is a film that (like many european masterpieces) badly needs a restoration. There are print demages and the sound sounds like it was recorded a decade before.",1033776000,38,1417,4.649402390438247

Germany, Year Zero is the third installment in famed director Roberto Rossellini's war trilogy which began with Rome Open City, followed by Paisan. While the first two films were set in Italy, Rossellini filmed this one in bombed out Berlin and cast largely local, non-professional actors giving the narrative a heady verisimilitude. When they began shooting, the screenplay consisted of only 15 pages; eventually, through improvisation, Rossellini completed the film in a very compact 1 hour and 15 minutes.

Rossellini cast Edmund Meschke, an 11 year old acrobat from the circus, to play the part of his protagonist, Edmund Kohler. Meschke bore a striking resemblance to Rossellini's recently deceased son, Romano.

Rossellini's story reflects what was going on in Germany after World War II. It's not a pretty picture with multiple families assigned by the Housing Authority to live in cramped tenements. The black market is thriving and everyone is desperate to purchase small items that might make their life slightly more comfortable. Rossellini illustrates this when he depicts the owner of Edmund's apartment building, Mr. Rademacher, instructing Edmund to sell a scale for cash. But Edmund is ripped off by a man on the street who trades the nave boy a couple of unappetizing cans of low grade meat instead.

Edmund and the men in his family bear the scars of Germany's defeat. Edmund's father, Mr. Kohler, a veteran of World War I, is now bedridden and bemoans the fact that he's become a burden to the family. Mr. Kohler concedes that he knew the Nazis were bad as they rose to power, but like others of his generation, did nothing out of fear or indifference. Worse is Edmund's older brother, Karl-Heinz, who fears he might be arrested as a war criminal since he fought in the Army to the bitter end. Failing to register with the authorities leaves the brother without a ration card, placing an additional burden on the family. Eva, the older sister, at least refuses to become a prostitute but scrounges for cigarettes by going out with American soldiers.

Rossellini does very well in depicting the spectre of Nazism still hovering over a defeated Germany like a plague that never goes away. At one point a construction worker utters on the street that we were once ""proud National Socialists"" but now we're ""just Nazis."" When Edmund runs into his former teacher, Henning, who is still a disciple of Hitler, it also becomes apparent that the man is a pedophile who has young Edmund in his sights. The now hardened Edmund takes Henning's admonitions to sacrifice the weak so that the strong can survive literally.

For Rossellini, the Hitler Youth is alive and well, as Edmund decides to poison his father--who indicates he would like to commit suicide but does not have the courage to do so. After his father dies, Edmund returns to Henning who claims he never told the boy to kill his father and now wants nothing to do with him as he fears he might be implicated by the authorities for egging the boy on.

Rossellini's denouement unfortunately is weak. He has Edmund jump off a building as he watches the hearse pick up his father's body across the street. Edmund becomes a symbol of the Nazi legacy and his ""sacrifice"" represents punishment for the German people in generalit is the ""sins of the fathers"" that corrupt a mere child who is unable to reconcile the hatred imprinted upon him with the contrasting true feelings of love for his own father.

There is also the question whether Edmund, who appears to have accepted the Nazi philosophy (even at such a precocious age), would actually go ahead and kill himself. It might have been more interesting if the boy rejoined his family for the funeral and acted as if nothing happened. Instead of growing up haunted by nightmares, he could have easily morphed into a psychopath, committing crimes in the new Federal Republic of West Germany or its more sinister counterpart in the East.",1482624000,,3995,4.882005899705015

7969572,5,B00006IUJ6,"GERMANY YEAR ZERO, (1948), (78 minutes), is one of a trilogy of World War II films by the towering Italian master director Roberto Rossellini.  It is available as a free-standing DVD, like this one, or in the recent release of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roberto-Rossellini-s-War-Trilogy-Rome-Open-City-Paisan-Germany-Year-Zero-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B002U6DVQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roberto Rossellini's War Trilogy (Rome Open City / Paisan / Germany Year Zero) (The Criterion Collection)</a>&nbsp;that presents us with clean, remastered copies of these three memorable films. GERMANY YEAR ZERO is, like the other films in this trilogy, in black and white.  In the trilogy, we can see Rossellini invent Italian neo-realism on the screen; he had to, as, at the time he was working, Italy and Germany were nearly destroyed by World War II bombing, there was very little infrastructure left, and it was hard to get  film, filmmaking equipment - and everything else.  Thus, the director worked with natural light and sound.  The trilogy also presents many informative extras: interviews with Rossellini's actress daughter Isabella; interviews with many of the films' actors, and film scholars, and ""Once Upon a Time . . . Rome Open City,"" a 2006 documentary on the making of Rossellini's most influential, important film.

GERMANY YEAR ZERO was filmed on location in Berlin shortly after war's end.  It was financed by German firms, and gives us a horrifying snapshot of the misery of civilian life in war-ravaged Berlin shortly after the war.  The concluding chapter of the war trilogy is devastatingly intense and effective, a portrait of an obliterated Berlin shown through the eyes of Edmund Kohler, a twelve-year-old boy whom Rossellini told interviewers strongly resembled his own son, who had been dead for a year at the time of filming.  Edmund lives in a bombed-out apartment building, where ten families have been jammed into one apartment, with a  bedridden father and two older siblings.  His older brother Karl-Heinz had been in the German Army and fought up to the end, the corner of the block on which they live, so is afraid of reprisals for this, and accordingly has never registered with the postwar authorities.  Therefore, the family of four has only three ration cards.  Edmund's pretty older sister Eva gets dressed up to go out every night drinking and dancing.  But she does not pursue these evenings to what a viewer would expect to be their obvious conclusion, and therefore comes home every night with only a few cigarettes, rather than cash money, to show for her time. This leaves handsome young Edmund as the sole breadwinner for his family.  He is mostly left to wander unsupervised, seeking to bring back money and/or food to these hungry people.  Edmund  gets involved in the black-market schemes of a group of teenagers.  He also comes under the malign influence of a Nazi-sympathizing former teacher of his, whose ideas sway him in anti-social ways.  Rossellini seems to be telling us that the boy's former teacher is probably homosexual, and therefore immoral. By the way, as this movie is in German, it is fully subtitled, thank goodness.

Rossellini (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/STROMBOLI-1950-With-Ingrid-Bergman-NTSC-Imported-for-All-Regions/dp/7885881512/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">STROMBOLI (1950) With Ingrid Bergman (NTSC Imported for All Regions)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Europa-51/dp/B001IKVWZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Europa '51</a>) had limited film, and so had to piece together  bits and pieces he'd begged from the city's photographers.  He wanted to create and release his films as soon as humanly possible after the war's end. Therefore, he built no sets, and, for the first time in Italian cinema, filmed his story entirely on the actual streets and in the actual buildings of Berlin. (He thereby established the Italian cinema protocol of realism, or neo-realism, as they preferred to call it, which held sway in Italian film for several decades.) He also didn't take much time in composing the composition, the lighting - he used natural light--or the shadows of his film, nor in worrying about its sound.  Dialog was largely improvised.

If you are interested in history, World War II, or Italy and/or Germany, you probably should see these films, though they certainly can be downers.  No contemporary audience can quite imagine how powerful these films were in their time, but, believe me, they are still tremendously powerful, and will certainly live a good long time because of their overwhelming performances and documentary value. GERMANY YEAR ZERO is a gut-wrenching human experience; by no means pleasant or fun.  Still, if you can take such an unvarnished look at life in a defeated nation after a monumental war, it is not to be missed.",1368144000,,4957,5.629032258064516
7969573,5,B00006IUJ6,"This is the third in a trilogy of like films by director Roberto Rossellini. It is a masterpiece, if only for its unflinching look at devastated post-war Germany. Filmed in 1948 in Berlin, one can see the aftermath of war with all it privations, inconveniences, and hideous consequences.

The film focuses on one family and the impact that the war has had. A sickly father, two sons, and a daughter have survived the war and each day is a struggle as they try to rebuild their lives. They live in a cramped, dilapidated apartment with six people in the wasteland of the war torn ruin that is now Berlin. Their collective apathy is palpable.

Food is scarce and no one has enough to eat. Edmund, the youngest son, is only thirteen, but he seems to be the only one trying to make sure that they continue to be able to exist, forgoing school to forage for food and other needed items. Yet he seems to get little gratitude for his efforts.

The story of Edmund is heartbreaking. Unappreciated by his family and taken advantage by others because of his young age, he looks for a way out of his struggles. Falling under the thrall of a former teacher, whose suggested predilection for young boys may be the cause for his no longer being able to teach, Edmund's mind concocts a solution for his family's troubles that is truly horrific. When he realizes the enormity of what he has done, what happens to Edmund will cause the viewers hart to break.

This is a haunting, superlative, and powerful neo-realist film on the far reaching consequences of war. The version that I saw was in German with English sub-titles. Unfortunately, the print quality of the film was extremely poor, as it was grainy and very faded. It is in dire need of restoration. This is one film that should not be lost due to the ravages of time.",1362960000,,1810,4.542944785276074
7969574,4,B00006IUJ6,"Germany Year Zero is a great film, and it resembles the similarly themed great French film by Robert Bresson, Mouchette, made two decades later, in which a female child has to deal with the death of a parent, poverty, sexual indiscretions, and ends up dead. But this film is anything but dead; it is the embodiment of a clich, though, in the best sense, for although clichs are often oversimplifications, they are also often based upon truths, and Germany Year Zero is an exemplar of the maxim that less is more. Yes, perhaps developing some of the other characters may have made the film more saleable to the public (it was a bomb upon its release), but its focus on the black and white mind of an impressionable and troubled child in extremis is a rarity, and makes the film not only a companion piece to Mouchette, but also to two other magnificent films that depict the lonely lives of children, Robert Wise's 1944 The Curse Of the Cat People and Inoshiro Honda's 1968 Godzilla's Revenge, which also features an industrial wasteland, criminals, and a possible pedophile. That's quite good company for this film to keep, as it bridges Neo-Realism with child-based psychodrama to produce one of the most unflinchingly brutal, yet tender, films in cinema history, as well as a rarity in film trilogies, a trilogy wherein each film is better than the preceding film.

7969577,5,B00006IUJ6,"Filmed amid the spectral ruins of Berlin in 1947, and cast with actual residents of the rubble-strewn capital city, Rossellini's harrowing portrait of war's catastrophic impact on everyday people is a haunting classic of Italian neo-realism. Of particular interest is the character of Herr Enning, an ambiguous figure with vaguely pederastic leanings, whose worldview has been unalterably twisted by Nazi ideology. When he gives Edmund a set of tapes--speeches by Hitler--for him to sell on the black market, he also dispenses a bit of corrosive advice about the weak and the strong that Edmund takes, tragically, very much to heart. ""Zero"" in on this brutal, yet heartrending drama.",1182470400,3,683,5.333333333333333
