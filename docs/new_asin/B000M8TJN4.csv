8167392,4,B000M8TJN4,"Just a fair to good Walt Disney TV production. Actually I think A Tomorrow Entertainment, Inc. production produced for the Disney Channel. I have a copy of it for the simple reason that Annette is in it.
Martin Mull (Frank Maris) and Annette Funicello (Julie Maris) quiet literally go on a winning streak. Then crash when it ends. It's very watchable, but lacks that little something that Walt put into the Disney movies.
I think of this movie every time someone ahead of me buys a lottery ticket at the gas station. And no I don't buy lottery tickets or scratch offs. As my Mother once told me, we can't afford any more of that free stuff. LOL.",1229212800,,645,4.47457627118644
8167393,5,B000M8TJN4,"When the Disney Channel was young and aimed at making quickly available family movies to show on the budding cable network, Lots of Luck (starring Annette Funicello and Martin Mull) was a memorable movie for me.

Annette's family is overworked and struggling, but smiling and getting by.  Their youngest daughter enjoys entering sweepstakes contests through the mail and Annette enjoys playing the lottery with her hair styling co-worker.  When her character wins the lottery - a ticket from the one day her co-worker didn't play - Annette's family successfully wins a million dollars!

They soon find out that some things are better for their winnings, but other things are worse. They keep at their jobs, but eventually lose their jobs due to the spectacle of their winnings.  They suddenly start winning sweepstakes contests hand over fist and their little house gets crammed with their winnings.  Eventually they go on a little spending spree, and the Mom and Dad take a trip to a tropical resort.  When they return from their trip, they are surprised to find out that the family's quick spending combined with Uncle Sam's taxes for the additional - make that MANY additional - things they win leaves them broke.  In the end, they decide they're okay with losing the money, and in order to earn a little extra money back to buy a small business for their future, they team up to enter an auto race where they have to cross town on one gallon of gas.  (A nice idea considering today's gas prices!)

Tracey Gold (from the 80s series Growing Pains) is one of the family's children, and Polly Holiday (Flo from the 70s series Mel's Diner) plays the excentric Grandma living with the family.  My husband and I enjoyed watching them in new roles, and my kids (who are oblivious to the previous parts) enjoyed all the characters and roles involved in this movie.

This fun plot shows a very idealized America, full of good friendships and problems that never really get anybody down.  The acting is basic, but nice.  The plot isn't deep, but it's fun.  Overall, everyone in my family enjoyed it enough to watch it over again.

I bought this movie specifically to watch it with my own husband and kids.  I figured they would like the movie, but what surprised me the most is how much my kids enjoyed all the 80s commercials about 70s movies ""now available on home video cassette"".  Many of those movies are not in our current Disney collection, and overall, I think they enjoyed watching the commercials just as much as watching the movie, if not more.  For my husband and I, we enjoyed watching everything as a nice flash back to a simpler, less cell-phoned, internet, mp3d time when producers took 5 minutes to sell a movie instead of 30 seconds and movies were about feeling good, not how much sex or divorce you can cram into an hour and a half.

If you're looking for controversy or deep plot, this isn't the movie for you.  If you want a flash back look into the Disney Channel archives, find a copy and enjoy!",1218412800,3,3012,4.666666666666667
