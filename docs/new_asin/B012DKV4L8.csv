The Neil Young In his own Words DVD catches the great man across eight different interviews (tallying up to over two hours of conversation). The recoding commences with a Q and A session as British actor and Reservoir Dogs star Tim Roth leads the analysis. Along the way Young opens up and comes across as totally focussed on his work but he can let that artistic intensity drop and he shows himself to be an engaging character-although, he is never far removed from his professional persona. Nonetheless, he can let down his guard and display a wicked sense of humour with the casual observer not necessarily expecting this quality. The star man is an artist who has taken chances and shown chameleon tendencies. Young is seemingly  always looking elsewhere for new ideas and fresh impetus-and, that can even mean ways to re-interpret the past to forge an alternative present. An eighties concentration also Neil celebrate the work of a number of acts that would not necessarily dovetail with his output but who have influenced his train of thought. Henceforth, The Clash, Human League, Devo and even Flock of Seagulls (who had a massive US fan base) get namechecks. There is also respect for other solo stars and 1988 diatribe puts Tracy Chapman on a pedestal and the inspiration of Woody Guthrie is perhaps more evident in elements of the canon of work that Neil has collated.

The acclaimed producer Daniel Lanois also joins the proceedings-and, it becomes evident that Young is a student of sonic scenes and that sparks his own genre hopping and the effect he has had on many other performers. The opportunity to hear his views offers a great deal of entertainment. Obviously his Crazy Horse band are renowned but perhaps not as well known are the stories about his crazy hearse! Check the chat because somewhere along the line even if you are not an obsessive you will have marvelled at one or more of his tunes. Whether it is Buffalo Springfield; Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young; solo: with a group; or collaborations this guy has some CV!

Neil Young never sleep! Watch this work and discover more about the man who has continued to deliver music over half a century. From Young to older, Neil has not burnt out or faded away!",1472860800,,2266,4.753180661577608
