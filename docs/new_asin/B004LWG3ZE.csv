8434963,5,B004LWG3ZE,"I've been a huge Royal Ballet fan ever since watching Yuhui Choe's ""A Day in the Life"" video on Youtube and then the first masterclass they posted for World Ballet Day. They've got such an incredible group of dancers from all over the world. I bought this DVD as a birthday gift for a friend because we LOVE McGregor's work. Seeing Eric Underwood on the cover is also a plus because we love seeing such a beautiful black dancer's talent being celebrated. I hope they keep making DVDs so we can replay these performances over and over.",1524355200,,534,4.515463917525773
8434964,5,B004LWG3ZE,"Wayne McGregor is re-writing the book of modern dance. These three pieces were choreographed for the Royal Ballet where McGregor was artist in residence from 2008-2011. The choreography-the movements-are elegant, lyrical, profoundly sensual, and the sets are stunning in their stark simplicity. All this set to musical scores perfectly pitched to enhance the dramatic impact of the ballets. These pieces may change the way you look at dance and human movement itself.",1443139200,3,467,5.5
8434965,4,B004LWG3ZE,"This is twenty first century ballet--computer generated images, the bodies torqued in gymnastic adagios.  Those for whom the lyricism of Ashton or the heady neo-classicism of Balanchine is de rigeur will not be amused.  While I much prefer the work of these masters, I found myself fascinated with McGregor's work here.  There seemed to be not an uncritical embrace of technological post modernism but a complex not always readable comment on it.  The work of the dancers permits no disagreement--it is startlingly good.  Even when you're not sure what they're up to, they emphatically do.",1443052800,3,589,5.157894736842105
8434966,5,B004LWG3ZE,"Wonderful dancing and an exciting, creative choreographer matched with modern music. Saw the ballet in London and immediately bought the blue ray disk",1389052800,3,150,5.565217391304348
8434967,5,B004LWG3ZE,"Wayne McGregor is a movement genius.  I have seen several of his works and come away inspired each time. His work takes me on an emotional roller coaster; I experience the entire spectrum of emotions when I witness his works.  I can't wait for ""Borderlands,"" his commission for the San Francisco Ballet, to come to DVD.",1365206400,5,319,4.678571428571429
8434968,5,B004LWG3ZE,"One thing about McGregor, nobody could be confused about who choreographed these dances.  The moves in each have a lot of elements in common, the stamp of McGregor is all over them.  I don't think I've seen men move in quite this way before ... it's intriguing, and that's an aspect I noticed immediately.  The costumes have a lot to do with redirecting the way we might view men in motion.  Some great choices in music, my favorite of the three is Infra.",1359849600,6,455,4.445783132530121
8434969,5,B004LWG3ZE,"Wayne McGregor's Triple Bill for the Royal Ballet is an exciting, intriguing, and intellectual sampling of the best of contemporary ballet. Enjoyable to both newcomers and ballet fans alike, the three works are something of the extraordinary. At first glance, these ballets are little more than hyperactive and seemingly random movement. However, the way the ballet reflects the music is alone something to marvel at.
Chroma, the first ballet in the program, is by far the most well-known. Winning several awards in 2007, the ballet, McGregor says, represents ""a freedom from white."" The set itself is a work of genius, a minimalistic white box that covers the Royal Opera House stage and features an ever-changing aperture in the back, from which dancers enter and exit. The music is very diverse, featuring Joby Talbot and orchestrations of the band, The White Stripes. The choreography and dancers are phenomenal, representing hypersexuality, homosexuality, and interracial love, all on the backdrop of our modern, monochrome world.
Infra, also having won several awards, is (to paraphrase McGregor) 'the idea of inferences of the human condition.' With tearful and touching choreography, Infra sheds light on the range of emotions individuals can procure. After displaying their emotion, they walk back into the pedestrian-esque march of people. The backdrop for this ballet is also especially unique, a strip of projectors that omit small white lights that draw pedestrians in various speeds, showing the monotony of our world.
Limen, the final ballet, 'explores the thresholds of dancers in relationship to light and music.' Omnipresent throughout the ballet are timers ticking randomly, with a beautiful and diverse cello concerto.
All of the dancers, the music, backdrops, and choreography are remarkable. Although watching the DVD in one sitting without knowing exactly what to expect and make the entire three ballets somewhat dry, separately, they are even more appreciable. After having seen this DVD several times, I still find new nuances in the dancers and choreography that I hadn't previously noticed. Also available on this DVD are introductions to each ballet, which prove useful for the choreographer's initial setting of each. I recommend this ballet to both newcomers and lovers of contemporary ballet.",1318032000,20,2324,5.4404432132963985
8434970,5,B004LWG3ZE,"Having a LARGE collection of dance films and movies, this one is One of my Favorites.  INFRA is one of the BEST pieces I've seen on film.  Choreography is EXCELLENT and the dancers are VERY good!",1317513600,13,195,4.388888888888889
8434971,5,B004LWG3ZE,"This DVD is fantastic because, if nothing else, it really is a great introduction for anyone into the world of contemporary ballet. Wayne McGregor has reached a great deal of popularity, and choreographing these three ballets was perhaps the best decision he's made. I am particularly attracted to Chroma. This particular DVD includes an introduction before each ballet, where McGregor discusses its creation and underlying ideas (which I love!). Chroma's flowing, bold, and very sensual movements fit the supremely fascinating music perfectly. His decision to create skin tone costumes and play with the idea of tonality works perfectly, and turns already beautiful choreography into ideas that get your mind working. Overall, a wonderful DVD, and I would recommend it even if it was only just Chroma that was included. The recording quality/filming is great, and the addition of intros by the choreographer make it all the better. What a delight!",1317254400,12,948,5.326666666666667
