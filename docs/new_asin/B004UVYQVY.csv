4471129,5,B004UVYQVY,"This charming film is about a group of singles who are trying to find themselves and accept themselves as they really are.  One of circle of friends is Annie who has alopecia (an autoimmune condition) and holds a party to explain her lack of follicles.  Sam, the main character who connects with all of the others, suddenly finds that he is in charge of a kid who follows him off the subway and initially does not speak to Sam.  The child has left his foster care placement.  The characters are all loveable and this is definitely a feel good movie with happy endings.  '",1309910400,,571,4.451923076923077
4471130,5,B004UVYQVY,"Simple, smart, honest, fun.  Vignettes of young people in New York City.  The city was allowed into the film, giving it's whole texture, rhythm.

One way to find interesting movies is to look for ""written and directed by"".  In this case Josh Radnor (who also stars).",1309737600,,266,4.717391304347826
4471131,4,B004UVYQVY,"I measure movies by a single rule - when it was over, am I glad that I watched it. With this movie, the answer is yes. I fully enjoyed the characters - and their lives.

Three friends come to the fore in this movie, each one is approaching a crisis in their lives. As each one faces it, we discover the meaning of friendship and loving support. In the beginning, each one has lost their way and facing an uncertain future. Although the movie only covers a little out of a week in their lives, we watch how as they face the crisis, they are able to move forward from this point. A very positive and very real movie.

What surprised me inside of the movie is that while Rasheen played a part, the focus was on Sam and his growth through knowing Rasheen, instead of this being a kid-centered movie. And yes, as Sam discovers in the movie, there are consequences to taking a child home with you, and facing these consequences helps Sam to face his own crisis.

It calls itself ""The Best Date Movie of the Year,"" and I can see both men and women enjoying it - and even more, talking about it afterwards.

The movie is rated ""R"" for adult themes including sex and drinking, and a bit of rough language. However, there is nothing explicit, and the language is minimal. Probably the most invasive part is the alcohol - with one scene including Sam clicking his beer against Rasheen's coke can, and them both burping afterwards.",1309737600,,1419,4.404580152671755
4471132,4,B004UVYQVY,"I liked this movie, however I did not love this movie. Its not a moving, or super deep bring tears to your eyes type film, its also not the type of movie that has your face hurting from smiling and laughing. BUT it was still not bad, and the plot was I think well thought out for what it is. Its been done many times already so nothing new or exciting... some parts were pretty cute though, I liked the 3 day sleep over and that the child was very artistic and encouraged so strongly in that. I wouldn't buy it, and I wouldn't spend money to watch it again but I don't regret the money I spent renting it :) I give it 3.5 stars.",1309737600,,628,3.992063492063492
4471133,5,B004UVYQVY,"I'm not going to summarize the story. Plenty of that already out there.  My thoughts about the movie are that if you like movies that focus on the characters and their relationships rather than a linear story, this movie is a rare treat.  Extremely well thought out.  Bad title almost kept me away.  Glad I took a chance.  I thought it was fantastic in all areas.  Interesting relationships with likable people, many life lessons mostly well presented, good production value, score was beautiful, smart character studies, perfectly understated delivery by the actors.  Found myself pausing to think about what was presenting at the moment.  Clearly the best of the current bunch playing.",1308960000,41,687,5.071428571428571
4471134,4,B004UVYQVY,"""What if you don't know whats best for you?""  After struggling writer Sam Wexler (Radnor) takes in a small child who is left behind on a subway he begins on a course that will change his life.  Stuck in a posisition of what's more important between the kid, his book or love life, Sam is left trying to find out who he is.  This is the type of movie that I have talked about before, a movie that because of no CGI and small budget gets forgot about by the studios and does not get the advertising it deserves.  This is one of the best movies of the year, and will continue to be one of the least scene.  Very dissapointing considering more people have seen and will continue to see movies like ""Drive Angry"".  Taking away the fact that Radnor both wrote and directed this, Malin Akerman is a huge surprise in this one.  Much like Milla Jovovich in ""Stone"" she is the definate break out acting star in this one.  In a drastic change from her usual choice she far and away steals the movie and proves that she is a joy to watch even with her clothes on.  Besides Akerman, the acting all around is excellent, but the fact that the budget is under $100,000 and no comic book hero or a car that becomes a robot this will not be seen by the audience that it deserves.  This is the type of movie there needs to be more of, but because of greed the studios refuse to take a chance on interesting movies like this one in favor of the next comic book hero, or the next sequel that doesn't seem necessary.  Overall easily one of the top ten best movies of the year so far. I give it an A.

Would I watch it again? - Yes, I would.

4471135,4,B004UVYQVY,"Written, directed and starring Josh Radnor, HAPPYTHANKYOUMOREPLEASE is a pleasant romantic comedy enhanced by a likable cast, clever dialogue and some nice songs by Jaymay.

Radnor plays an aspiring novelist who meets a young boy, separated from his family on the subway.  When the boy refuses to let Rador take him to the police or social services, the writer, foolishly, lets the kid stay with him, a decision that could result in kidnapping charges.

Yet, despite this intriguing storyline, HAPPYTHANKYOUMOREPLEASE is, essentially, a movie about a bunch of neurotic New York folk who have relationship problems, either committing to or even recognizing the right person when he or she comes along.

Radnor, for example, meets the woman of his dreams (Kate Mara), an wannabe cabaret singer, but avoids meeting her needs, while his best friend (Malin Akerman), who keeps getting involved with ""a**holes,"" tries to shun the nerdy perfect guy (Tony Hale) who is pursuing her.  Still, another of Sam's friends (Zoe Kazan), because of her insecurities, tries to ""deep six"" her long term live-in relationship with her boy friend (Pablo Schreiber) when he announces he wants to move to Los Angeles and, also, marry her.

 Everything turns out just fine in HAPPYTHANKYOUMOREPLEASE, a marvelous date movie.

Development of two plots (young boy in foster care and two co-workers looking for a relationship) were kept simple for the amount of time and diversity needed; and still felt genuine. Always love Zoe Kazan's portrayal of any character she plays and her counterpart (Pablo) was well played.

4471173,2,B004UVYQVY,"I'm a big fan of How I Met Your Mother, so I was excited and curious to see this. Mistake. The only character I cared about was the kid, who seemed to be a somewhat pointless afterthought written into the show. Were the couples interesting? Nope. They are a bunch of middle-aged whinos whose stories (so-called problems) are trivial and beyond boring. What took the cake was having a girl named Mississippi sing a sub-par-sounding Broadway-ish number. What the Chuck?!

This really could've been knocked out of the park. The kid should've been the catalyst in bringing everyone together in different ways according to their relationships. While the script may knock the ""red"" states, I'm sorry to break it to you, but if you've got a character named Mississippi, you need to be able to have said character sing some kick-ass jazz or blues......anyone can do a Streisand rendition of a song.......y'all just can't have a 16 oz. soda to go with it (jes kiddin....someone with some sense rescinded that ""blue"" state order in June.)

4471185,3,B004UVYQVY,I would actually rate this movie 3.5 stars (and would have given it 4 starts if it hadn't been for the circumstances involving a child being introduced early on under some extremely strange circumstances that totally distracted my attention from the plot development).  The only other weakness involved the female romantic lead who wasn't quite right (her over use of eye liner was super distracting) and her singing was pretty lame.  All of the secondary character actors were superb:  the strength of this movie.,1404604800,,514,5.095238095238095
4471186,2,B004UVYQVY,"I Love Great Indie Films BUT This Isn't One Of Them!!!!! Instead of wasting my time retelling what's already been told regarding this film, I suggest you read the other 2 Star reviews and especially the 1 Star review by Tyson. I didn't hate it quite as much as Tyson but there are numerous other indie films that are far more enjoyable. In addition to those other reviews I would add the following: It's obvious that Josh Radnor loves Jamay's music and it's fine BUT I HATE WHEN MUSIC IS PUT IN A FILM AT EXCESSIVE VOLUME TO BEAT ME OVER THE HEAD AND TELL ME HOW TO FEEL!!!!!!! The last film I can recall that totally turned me off for the same reason was a Dennis Quaid film entitled ""In Good Company."" Also the timing (color timing) is WAY off on several occasions...very dark to overexposed in a split second and vice versa. If you want to see a film with excellent timing, watch anything by David Lynch. Sorry Josh. Better luck next time.",1403136000,,942,4.388571428571429

So it was a little hard to get too excited to hear that Josh Radnor, the actor who plays Ted wrote, directed, produced, and stared in a movie.  It also did not help it had an overly pretentious title: Happythankyoumoreplease.  My keyboard did not jam, there is actually no spaces in the name.  The title is (almost) explained in the movie, but still annoying for how it is presented.  If this were How I Met Your Mother, the other characters would be holding an intervention for Ted.

The movie follows six New Yorkers, three of which are friends, as they struggle to find, or keep love.  It is filled with so many young middle class white people problems, it is hard not to think of that other sitcom actor turned writer.  Really it is anti-depressants, death, and a move of a couple miles south away from being Garden State.  Well that and the soundtrack is not nearly as cool.

But the performances are solid.  As usually Radnor is the least interesting as a failing writer who inexplicably picks up a young black kid on the subway and decides to take care of him while trying to pursue Kate Mara (Urban Legend: Bloody Mary), a waitress and wannabe singer.  Malin Akerman (The Watchmen) is a woman who cannot grow hair who has terrible taste in men, and cannot tell when a good one is right in front of her, even Tony Hale (Buster Bluth!).

4471262,4,B004UVYQVY,"Seriously.  I'm not even saying it!  Luckily the quality of the content makes up for the lousy title.

It's a love story that actually manages to keep me -a 31-year old man who normally HATES love stories- interested.  That's impressive!  It's about three different couples with their own dilemmas.  This is a drama, not a comedy.  I guess if there is any comedy, it's not really the kind you want to laugh out loud at.  It's more like ""Oh, haha"" and that's it.

One couple contemplates whether to live in either New York or Los Angeles and the tough obstacles associated with such a tremendous decision.  This was easily the weakest of the three stories.  I didn't really care for anything this couple did or said the whole time.  The second story -arguably the most important and biggest one- involves a single man who inadvertently kidnaps a young kid because for some reason he doesn't know what to do when he sees the kid stranded (which might make this guy the most clueless and irresponsible person in the world when you think about it) and eventually impresses a girl he meets at a bar while dragging the kid all around town.  He tries to ditch the kid a few times but ultimately -thanks to regret usually- it never happens.

The final story centers around a bald-headed woman (maybe she had cancer, maybe not- was never really sure) who constantly makes terrible decisions and hooks up with the wrong men that only leave her feeling emptiness inside.  This final one is the most underrated of the three storylines because, in my opinion, it has the best conclusion and actually makes me feel somewhat emotional and satisfied... remember, I'm NOT a fan of these type of love movies so simply allowing me to feel anything at all is a tremendous piece of writing in my eyes.

With all that said, there never really was a purpose or a moral at the very end.  Basically it's 3 relationships that develop fairly normally with the occasional awkwardness at other times (a kidnapped boy sleeping in a room while a man is trying to impress a girl in the other room isn't particularly normal, heh) but I suppose if there *is* a moral it's that all men around 30 years old (like me for example!) are really childish (yes, I am!) and don't know how to take relationships seriously (once again, it's like watching a spittin' image of me on screen, lol).  Overall however, I was actually entertained and even grew attached by such simple writing and characters, and I can't help but recommend it.

Oh and on a final note- the soundtrack is AWESOME!  I'm not really aware of the current music scene and instead stick to my mid 70's German rock music (Tangerine Dream anyone?) or rockin' down to GFR (tell everybody you know you got some rock 'n roll soul!) but these songs are really melodic, upbeat and amazingly sung.",1347494400,,2813,4.610441767068273

4471264,2,B004UVYQVY,"If you had never seen Seinfeld, and after 10 years of it being on the air you suddenly watched an episode you would have no idea about who the characters are and why their dialogue only makes sense to a fan who watched it day after day.  You would have no idea why a Kramer entrance would be funny, nor would you care.

That pretty much sums up ""Happy Thank You More Please"". It is a slice in the life of people you don't know and have no reason to care about.  The writer/producer (who also couldn't think of anyone good enough to play the part of himself so he cast himself as the lead character) offers absolutely zero character development.  There is an ensemble cast straight out of daytime soaps who do three things ... have sex with each other, argue with each other, make up with each other, all intertwined with another musical bridge from Jaymay.  Repeat. Then repeat again until the viewer is ready to scream.

It is difficult to imagine a cast of less attractive people.  This was probably done intentionally so we could ""relate"" to them but it more often added to the viewer feeling of not caring about their petty little problems.

The women are all shallow and delusional and easily seduced by anything that wears pants. The men are equally stereotyped as crass, cheating and dense.  They screw each other over (physically and emotionally) yet are drawn back to each other like musk ox in heat.

Other than the aforementioned screw/argue/makeup rituals (with obligatory musical bridges from Jaymay) of several couples who kinda know each other there is almost nothing that happens in their lives.  So it really makes the viewer ask ""why make a movie about them?""  An important component of the movie to the writer/producer seems to be the mandatory inclusion of a poor cute kid who doesn't even know how old he is.  But his relationship with the primary character, like the rest of the movie, is shallow and vapid.

Bottom line, this movie is about as clich&eacute;d as they get, full of self-pitying angst.  The person I watched it with falls into the age range of what this movie is supposed to be about.  Here's that person's take.  ""Tonight I wasted 98 minutes of my life watching Happy Thank You More Please ... I sure as hell wouldn't buy it. Bored me to tears.""

4471266,4,B004UVYQVY,"To me independent or ""indie"" films can either be really good (I really enjoyed The Visitor) or really, really, REALLY, make-you-question-why-you-even-tried-the-film bad (Just about every indie zombie film out there).  I guess in my older age of 28 I'm becoming harder and harder to please with my cynical take on life.  However, in the tradition of being an objective reviewer I gave... the movie with the really cumbersome title the benefit of the doubt when given the opportunity to go over it.

Having watched the film with my trusted test audience, my drinking buddies with a full compliment of PBR, we came to the following conclusion and I quote: ""Meh, It was OK.""

The story isn't anything new as it follows the trials and tribulations of a handful of New Yorkers trying to figure things out (Rent, anyone?).  In the middle of it all is a writer taking in a foster child, something unique but not exactly heart warming.  In fact, we found that the film tried waaay too hard to be sentimental with all the mushy gushy moments that are not quite plot twists.  It's just too darned quirky to be believable, almost as if it was taking place in an animated world or something by Tim Burton as my test audience and I kept on shouting, ""Oh, whatever"" at the screen.  It just wasn't that believable.

Pertaining to my earlier reference to the ""twists,"" simply put, there are none.  The story almost flows like a ""dear diary"" during the mundane parts of someone's life.  Yes, the hardships the character, who weren't really that well elaborated on, went through genuine hardships that plague the lives of anyone not living in a cave and/or their mom's basement but... it's mundane and overdone.  All their problems have been examined waay too much in other films or just aren't that interesting.  It'd be like me making a film about my normal day consisting of meetings and time on the sales floor: it would only be interesting if I included six months of quirky customer stories into a 30-minute episode on TV... *LIGHT BULB*

Not to say the film with the odd title wasn't well done, everything else in production and post wasn't bad at all given it's an indie title with severe hotties.  Problem is that the writing killed the film or made it not so good for those in the general audience that want a good experience.

All in all, a rental.",1334707200,,2340,4.656934306569343

4471278,4,B004UVYQVY,"Josh Radnor, of ""How I Met Your Mother"" fame, penned and directed this likeable indy dramedy.

Here's the scoop. You have six people in NYC. Two who are in a relationship and the other four who are working on it. The main story is Radnor, a short story writer, who takes in a young boy who has been run around the foster system. He's also coming to grips with the fact he might have commitment issues. Another couple is at a crossroads in their relationship and they need to make that next hurtle. In the third story, a girl in a publishing house seems to always pick the wrong guys to date. The guy who adores her, and might be Mr. Right, seems too unlike her. He needs to convince her otherwise.

Radnor seems a decent sort and he writes himself that way. His character, Sam, has a good heart but suffers some issues he needs to address. He spends the movie working on things. Kate Mara, as Mississippi, is his 'hope to be' love interest, if he can can resolve things with his demons. Malin Akerman is better than I've ever seen her as Annie, who needs to see that she's worth having a guy who will be good to her. Someone whom she won't need to babysit. Bram Barouh and Zoe Kazan play Spencer and Mary who are working to get to the next level in their relationship. All do a fine job. This is very viewer friendly. Maybe too much so. Radnor is from TV world and it shows here. He felt a bit too much need to resolve all, or most, of the stories.  But you do like these people and root for them. They are all maybe a bit too self aware but they know who they are both in their strong and weak suits. They know what they need to do.

Josh shoots New York lovingly. He doesn't show you the down and dirty. He shows you the sunny and nice. The soundtrack is of the singer/ songwriter, indy variety which suits things just fine. If you liked ""Garden State"", you'll probably enjoy this as well.",1326931200,,1891,4.2154696132596685

4471283,3,B004UVYQVY,"If you're reading down here, and made it past the review title, then apparently my question sparked your interest... perhaps in the same way the fact that this movie was 'made by' Josh Radnor has sparked my own interest.  Well, that and the fact that this film also includes Kate Mara whom I happen to find irrestibly cute.  Anyway... hmmm, there was a question back to there somewhere... oh, yeah, why?  Why couldn't I make it through this film completely before breaking down and writing this review.  Really, this is the first time that I recall writing a review of film without watching it completely, though I suppose I could be wrong there as I may have written a review of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fred-Claus/dp/B000YABV7W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fred Claus</a>, a film that I just couldn't stomach after the first 30 minutes or so... (I can't imagine it ever getting better, despite my hoping to find some good in it... I had to admit that every now and then critics seem to be right in panning certain films.)

Anyway, I really do try to watch all of any movie that I'm going to review, and I will try to get back to watching the end of this film at some point.  I might really enjoy it, though I just don't know there.  Actually, one other time that I recall nearly giving up on a film that I later found myself enjoying was in sitting with my first wife and watching the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Australia-Blu-ray/dp/B001PPGAIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Australia  [Blu-ray</a>].  In that particular case it was entertaining enough to keep me watching, but left me wondering just what the film was trying to be over the first third or perhaps half of it's running time.  That film did get better in the later portion and I found myself happy to have sat and watched it.

In this particular case though... I just don't know.  If I find myself thinking differently, I'll come back and edit/update this review and/or add a comment here, but in the end I'm just so indifferent about this film that I can't find the inertia to get started watching the rest of it.

I know full well there are plenty of people that will find this one to be one of the best films they've ever seen and I wouldn't tell them they are wrong, but I think my own experience with it offers a decent explanation as to why it seemed to fly by below everyone's RADAR.  It just doesn't rise to the level that makes it an unforgettably enjoyable experience, at least not for me, an average Joe (who could probably use some time at the gym in this very humorous film:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dodgeball-A-True-Underdog-Story-Unrated-Blu-ray/dp/B00193F304/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (Unrated) [Blu-ray</a>]).

Really, if you are looking for a decent independent film that has flown below the RADAR but still merits watching, I'd offer up this alternative instead:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Finder-s-Fee/dp/B0000C2IQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Finder's Fee</a>, a very surprising film from someone that is normally recognized as a reality TV host, rather than an accomplished writer/director.

Another couple of interesting films that are worth a look:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Special/dp/B00283UPQ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Special</a>&nbsp;or try:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Be-Kind-Rewind/dp/B001B6PBLU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Be Kind Rewind</a>.

4471284,4,B004UVYQVY,"This is a pleasant little diversion, if you can overlook the implausible and ill-advised idea of taking in a runaway foster child. One wonders why intelligent people don't think ahead- is this going to be trouble, much less illegal? It can be irritating to see this lack of focused actions on the part of screen writers and actors, instead of presenting solutions...but then again perhaps this is some peoples' realities.

We do have a wonderful acting on the part of Malin Akerman who we ache for in her pattern of unsuccessful romance- her story could have been a whole movie.

There are extras included of audio commentary with Josh Radnor and producer Jesse Hara. It does not have subtitles. There are English and Spanish subtitles for the movie itself.

4471287,2,B004UVYQVY,"What exactly are the thought processes that lead a screenwriter to think that giving your film a title like ""Happythankyoumoreplease"" is a good idea? I presume it's the same thought processes that led this film's screenwriter to think it was a good movie.

The story concerns Sam, a freelance short story writer who is dissatisfied with a career that's enabled him to have a nice apartment in New York City. One day while riding the subway, he sees a young boy get separated from the people he's with. He makes a half-hearted attempt to get the kid to the police and reunited with his legal guardians, but after a token resistance from the boy, he gives up and take the kid home to live on his couch. Yes, this actually happens in this film. Oh, and he also meets a woman named Mississippi. Indeed.

Intercut with his story are two others, one of which is boring (a woman and her boyfriend are having relationship issues that seem to exist entirely within her head and might have to move to Los Angeles. Did you know that hip, New York-dwelling twentysomethings hate LA?), and the other of which is interesting (a hairless woman is courted by a man who isn't her type). Had the film focused on that second story, it might have worked well.

Aside from that one plot, which isn't really much more than an afterthought, no part of this movie works, and its riddled with indie film cliches. Ironic New Yorkers hate Los Angeles! People in their twenties are scared of relationships! Not shaving for a week makes you look cool and interesting instead of like a twit who can't afford a razor. About the only cliche it manages to avoid is gay cowboys eating pudding, and if they'd had a hip and ironic way of working that into the story, I'm sure it would have been there.

There's nothing really original or noteworthy here. The plot is pretty unrealistic. None of the characters are especially likable, except possibly Sam 2 and Anne. None of them are people I want to spend five minutes with, much less 98. The filmmakers clearly meant well, and there's enough talent on display to keep me from loathing the movie, but I certainly didn't like it.",1314576000,5,2142,4.584856396866841

I thought About a Boy was a real treat and the cast to this movie was great so if you put two and two together, this movie could have been great. But it really wasn't.

The real problem is the three plotlines. This movie is a little over an hour and a half, so there really is a lot of time to deal with three separate romances. You just don't really get invested in the characters because you don't have any time to. By the time you really feel like you know who these people are, it's already time for the end.

I would've cut the romance involving Zoe Katan and Pablo Schreiber. The characters get the least amount of screen time and their whole story is incredibly generic. Tony Hale and Malin Akermann were surprisingly charming and I would've liked to have seen their story get a little more attention.

The main plot is a little far-fetched but that's kind of what you sign up for when you watch a movie. I did not have a problem with the plot, it's just poorly executed. There just isn't enough time.

 I like to see more out of Happythankyoumoreplease, but I can't really review what could've been. Frankly, since there likely won't be anymore, I cannot really recommend that you watch this movie.

In a significant side note, the deleted scenes on the DVD add a tremendous amount of depth to the characters' stories and personality, especially Rasheen's too-good-to-be-true little kid.

The movie opens with Sam (main character) stumbling onto a little boy on a train.  Suffice to say that the slacker Sam doesn't do a very good job getting the boy to the authorities, and instead lets him hang around for the better part of a week (totally implausible!)  There are a few moments like that sprinkled throughout the movie (things that are hard to imagine, things that are too tied up too neatly in a bow).  As a result, it is worth the watch, but missing anything particularly amazing - adequate plot, adequate acting, etc.  Worth the first watch but hard to justify a repeat.",1313452800,,733,4.564885496183206
4471302,3,B004UVYQVY,"Just finished watching this with the hubby and I'm wondering if maybe we're not the target audience. We're in our thirties, been married ten years with a toddler sound asleep in his bed upstairs. We're so far removed from the life portrayed in this film that we couldn't relate to many of the characters.

The main character, Sam, is a freelance writer who mostly does short stories. He has trouble with the longer, form, the novel, and his life mirrors that since his relationships are mostly short-lived (with the exception of his best friend.)This is a movie about Sam and his friends growing up.

The good things about the movie are that there were some moments that made us laugh. Also, I thought I thought the ideas were original. If this is Josh Radnor's first jaunt as writer, he should do it more often.

The bad things however, outweigh the good. I had a hard time really liking any of the characters. I felt like they were making obviously stupid decisions. I also had a hard time buying Radnor as Sam because every time I looked at him, I saw Ted Mosby. His mannerisms were the same as Ted, he was just a much more irresponsible version of him. I also thought some of the dialogue was awkward, especially in the bar when Sam is flirting with Mississppi.

So we'll probably not watch this a second time, but again, I don't think we're the target audience. Perhaps younger people would enjoy this.",1313280000,2,1407,4.571428571428571

4471304,4,B004UVYQVY,"HappyThankYouMorePlease is one of those ""feel good"" movies that you want to love. And, if you can stay along for the entire journey, and are willing to overlook a few completely implausible assumptions, this movie ends up fulfilling its promise. Josh Radnor (""How I Met Your Mother"") wrote, directed, and stars as the main character - Sam Wexler, a likeable, if aimmature aspiring writer with his 20-something circle of friends in New York City. Sam's best friend Annie (Malin Akerman), who has propecia (loss of hair), struggles with her romantic partners and sense of self-worth. Mary (Zoe Kazan) and Charlie (Pablo Schreiber) are torn between a move to LA and staying in NYC. And Mississippi (Kate Mara) - the waitress and singer that Sam courts, only to question his own goals in love and life. If there is any standout in this cast, it's Tony Hale (Arrested Development) - who plays a self-described nerd who aims to show Annie what true love is all about.

At the very start of the movie, Sam befriends a young boy who is separated from his foster mother on a subway. And while Sam attempts to immediately re-unite them, his efforts are thwarted. And this is the biggest plot point you have to overlook throughout the entire movie. Because instead of taking the boy to the police (he gets close), he befriends him. This does eventually bring consequences, but who could imagine NOT immediately getting the police or authorities involved to assist?

If you can imagine to get past the implausible, having a new young friend gives Sam a new perspective.

In the end, this movie leaves you smiling, although it certainly won't win any Oscars along the way.",1312675200,,1659,4.814035087719298

4471306,3,B004UVYQVY,"This film presents a solid ensemble of actors (including the film debut of a child actor) exploring their roles in life and how they perceive themselves and their peers. With multiple interconnected sub-plots occuring in the film some of the characters don't get developed too fully, though overall this film is driven by characters, their thoughts and feelings about themselves and others. This film is satisfying, though not exceptionally memorable. The ending felt like it could have been expanded some, while it seems like it offers a pleasing bit of closure for viewers. The film's title comes from a sort of self-help spiritual mantra of saying to the Creator/Universe ""thank you, more please"" in developing a positive, grateful attitude. That's something we can all take from this film - becoming more grateful. This film may not make your list of all-time favorites but I'd recommend it for a satisfying drama about life and self-discovery.",1311811200,,948,5.162337662337662

It just didn't have anything that will make it memorable to me years from now. Perhaps I'm missing the message because I'm not from this generation?",1311120000,,406,4.611111111111111
4471311,4,B004UVYQVY,"Sam Wexler is a lonely, struggling writer living in Manhattan.  While rushing to make it on time to an interview with a publisher, he rescues a cute orphan boy, Rasheen, who is lost on the subway.  The interview is ruined.  To complicate matters, Rasheen won't allow Sam to take him to the police.  Sam falls in love with Mississippi, a gorgeous waitress who is a struggling singer.  Sam's best friend, Annie, has low self esteem because of an autoimmune deficiency that has left her bald; she is attracted to losers like a magnet but has been deflecting the advances of a successful, kind-hearted lawyer, Sam 2, who works in her company.  Sam's other friends, Mary-Catherine and Charlie, who live together, are afraid of taking their relationship one step further to the marriage altar.

  An evangelist once taught me that Christians should have an attitude of gratitude.  In other words, we should always be thankful for what we have been given.  When Annie once stepped into a cab, the Indian driver told her she had the potential to be very happy if she always said ""Thank you"" and followed it with ""More please.""  Charlie once told Mary-Catherine that LA was a blank canvas that reflects one's attitudes.  If you believe you're going to love LA, then you'll see it as the best city in the world.  From watching ""HappyThankYouMorePlease,"" I've learned that, in order to achieve success, love, happiness, and all the other good things in life, one must believe in oneself and have a positive attitude that one will obtain them.  This is a spiritual concept that is prevalent in most religions.

  ""HappyThankYouMorePlease"" is a sweet, quirky, uplifting film that is fun to watch.  It will encourage the lovelorn not to lose hope in finding someone special and eventually having a family.  I believe that Sam's reluctance to surrender Rasheen to the authorities is the product of his subconscious desire to have a family.  He is pushing thirty and his biological clock (men also have them) is probably screaming for him to begin reproducing.  As soon as Sam finds the adorable surrogate ""son"", he finds the adorable surrogate ""wife"", Mississippi.  He barely knows her when he practically begs her to move into his apartment.  Mary-Catherine and Charlie are close to the altar but are having commitment issues.  Several surprises help spur them onward.  I think Annie is extremely attractive (I love her wardrobe); unfortunately, she doesn't.  She soon learns after dating the witty, sincere lawyer that true beauty comes from within.

  The soundtrack is excellent.  Much of the music, provided by singer/songwriter Jaymay, contains lyrics that complement the film's drama.  The DVD contains a short featurette that focuses on Jaymay.  Also, the DVD has deleted scenes that further explain what is transpiring in the film; they are essential viewing.  They include one disturbing scene in which Rasheen kicks and beats on a boy who purposely walked into him.  When Sam scolds him, Rasheen asks him if he's going to beat him.  This scene hints at the abuse the little boy must've suffered at the hands of his foster parents and why he doesn't want to return to them.  Without this scene, the film does not contain any violence.  Neither does the film contain graphic depictions of sex.  There is only the frequent use of the four-letter ""f"" word, which gives it an R rating.

  Anchor Bay Entertainment has provided an excellent presentation of ""HappyThankYouMorePlease"" on DVD.  As mentioned before, it has a featurette on Jaymay and deleted scenes; it also has a theatrical trailer and audio commentary provided by Producer/Writer/Director/Actor Josh Radnor (star of the hit television series ""How I Met Your Mother"") and Producer Jesse Hara.  The film is presented in its theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1 and has English and Spanish subtitles.  Thank you Anchor Bay for providing subtitles for those of us who are hearing impaired.

  ""HappyThankYouMorePlease"" is not a raunchy, hormonally driven sex comedy.  It is an emotionally uplifting, inspirational, teary-eyed romance that gives people like me, who've been single for a very long time, hope that there is someone out there for them.  Though it is not totally realistic, it does, however, provide excellent advice on having a positive attitude towards one's self image and self worth.  In order to be loved, one must first love oneself.  Remember Whitney Houston's hit song, ""Greatest Love of All.""  The greatest love of all is learning to love oneself.  How very true.  In conclusion, I must state that this film has made me very Happy.  To Josh Radnor, I must say, ""Thank You.""  Furthermore, I beseech him to please make more movies like this one.  ""More Please.""

4471312,3,B004UVYQVY,"This was one of those movies that was good enough to generally hold my attention, but not so good that I'd ever want to watch it again, or listen to the commentary on the DVD. Nothing really stood out for me, either good or bad, although there were some significant implausibilities in the story line (including one of my pet peeves - skirting the issue of the economics of living in NYC).

I would say it is a somewhat promising start for Josh Radnor (the writer/director). Hopefully, he can continue to hone his skills on his next film.",1310947200,,538,4.489795918367347
4471313,3,B004UVYQVY,"""happythankyoumoreplease"" is a solid first effort from writer/director/star Josh Radnor (of ""How I Met Your Mother""). He plays Sam, a struggling writer who connects with Rasheen, a lost boy, on the subway. At first, Sam wants to help the boy get home, but after learning Rasheen is in foster care, he lets him stay at his apartment for a few days. Meanwhile, Sam's best friend Annie is rejecting the advances of her odd-yet-sincere co-worker, and his cousin Mary Catherine faces major changes in her life.

The story of Sam and Rasheen flows through the whole film while three subplots--Annie and her co-worker, Mary-Katherine and her boyfriend, and Sam and Mississippi (the waitress Sam falls for)--cut in and out. I found Annie's story utterly charming, and anytime Michael Algieri's Rasheen was on camera, he stole the scene. The one story line I couldn't have cared less about was Sam and Mississippi. While Kate Mara was quite likeable as Mississippi, I didn't sense any chemistry between her and Radnor. As the movie progressed, I realized I only cared about what happened to Annie and Rasheen--the rest of the stories were fine but unmemorable. I also kept asking myself when the film would turn dark--after all, though Sam had good intentions, his keeping Rasheen in his apartment was essentially kidnapping--but Radnor easily smoothed things out once the authorities became involved. Nice, but completely implausible. But put that aside, and you have an enjoyable--if forgettable--film.

If you enjoy quirky indie films, you'll probably like this one.",1310601600,,1560,5.186507936507937
4471314,3,B004UVYQVY,"Personally, I don't really like most of the ""Summer Blockbuster"" type of films.  I have friends who line up for those movies and tell me, ""I just want to see something where I can turn my brain off and eat some popcorn.""  Not my thing, but fair enough, I suppose.

""Happythankyoumoreplease"" is the indie film version of that.  If you turn your brain off and want to watch a feel-good film, then this is what you're looking for.  Why turn your brain off?  Well, not a single character in this movie actually acts or reacts to their situations in a way remotely close to how a person would react in the real world.

""Happythankyoumoreplease"" is about a group of happy and creative people living happy and creative lives in New York.  One of the happy and creative people, Sam, is a little less happy because he's having trouble breaking his writing career to the next level and has commitment issues.  Sam ends up caring for a boy separated from his family on the subway and learns lessons about being selfless (and also makes him seem like less of a jerk when you see how he treats women).  Another happy-creative person wants to move to L.A. to further his career, while his artist girlfriend wants to stay in New York (stereotypical L.A. bashing lifted from a Woody Allen film ensues).  The optimistic girl with alopecia who volunteers for non-profits keeps dating the ""wrong"" kind of guys because she can't get over her superficial standards (base irony: girl with a disease that affects people's physical appearance judges people for their looks).

So, there you go.  The movie is a week in the life of those people.  I did have a few laughs during the film, and it's a mostly harmless little flick.  Most of the characters are mildly pretentious and don't give the viewer much to grab on to, as far as personality (a point made by the film itself in a scene when a publisher is criticizing the Sam's novel, but really making a meta-criticism of the movie). I wonder what other titles they were working on for the movie?  ""FirstWorldProblems""?  ""TrustFundArtistsSlightlyVexed""?  ""There'sNoWayThesePeopleCouldAffordTheseApartmentsInNYC""?

Regardless, this is a harmless flick.  At least, I suppose there's no harm in turning the brain off and watching a the indie feel-good film version of a popcorn-flick.

4471315,2,B004UVYQVY,"HAPPYTHANKYOUMOREPLEASE is a very paint by numbers movie that does little to add anything original to the movie landscape.  This movie borrows heavily from two movies that you wouldn't necessarily put together:  Big Daddy and Singles.  Sam Wexler (Josh Radnor) takes young Rasheen under his wing when he gets separated from his foster family on the subway in New York.  However the story lacks the Sandler brand of comedy to make this compelling.  What you get instead from Sam is someone fond of the one night stand who tries to get a little more serious with Mississippi (Kate Mara) who is a bartender/cabaret singer.  There are two other sets of couples in different stages of relationship crisis (the Singles angle), but it is difficult to find any sympathetic characters in this hodgepodge story.  The best performance comes from Arrested Development favorite Tony Hale as Sam #2 - a subtle nod to his onetime AD love interest who was known as Lucille 2.  Otherwise there is little that is memorable about this movie.  I would recommend skipping it all together.",1310083200,3,1067,4.916201117318436

Just on the preview I took the chance, and I am so glad I did.  Its a cumulation of scenes in the lives of New York, late 20something, city dwellers, exploring friendship, love, relationships and their convoluted, unfulfilling views on all of it.

This is a WINNER on so many levels.  The acting is low key but touching and excellent.  The storyline(s) very moving.  I love the men in this movie, Josh Radnor rocks!  But Sam#2 has got to be my fave, amongst the men.

As it seems with other contemporary films, the women always seem to be the heroic saviors of the messed up men.  In this film however, under very low radar, the men turn out to be the heroic saviors of the messed up women.  This was such a sweet aspect and done so subtly, that it wins you over with its charm.

For me this film comes down to the EXCEPTIONAL writing.  There were no cold spots in this script.  It was clever, imaginative, honest and compelling.  It covers the standard human quest TO LOVE AND BE LOVED but in a very fresh and  sincere way.

No car chases, no shoot'em ups, no sweeping, fancy apartments, just dialogue and interactions that make you listen and THINK.

I know I have tried to be more gracious in my dealings with others since I watched HAPPYTHANKYOUMOREPLEASE.

That said, there is not a lot of other things going on in this movie that will probably not stick with you very long. The main character ""finds"" a little boy on the bus and decides to ""keep"" him. The boy, Rasheen, is absolutely adorable and he steals every scene he is in just by his facial expressions. I wanted to keep him, too.  Other than that this is just a pleasant, non-offensive movie that is suitable for most audiences. There are a couple of adults-only sections, but they are  few and far between.
