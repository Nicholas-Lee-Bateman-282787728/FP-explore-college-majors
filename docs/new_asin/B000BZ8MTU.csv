8094672,2,B000BZ8MTU,"Jensen probably means well, but I found some of his suggestions to be negative to the sport.  When teaching the return of serve in doubles for example, he suggests ""pinching the box"" in order to ""throw your opponent off"".  He actually suggests you stand to receive the first serve of the match on the Deuce side, and have your partner who is standing on the Ad side of the court step in and return serve by surprise!  Seriously?  And I don't  believe it's legal for your partner to sit on the sidelines and get a drink while your team is returning serve.  I never want to hear a pro talk about how to ""drive (an) opponent nuts"" or about ""messing around with their heads"".  These tactics are acceptable in certain circles I suppose, but not the example I would set for my students.  This DVD was a bad purchase.  When I expressed my dissatisfaction to the seller, they told me they'd never had a complaint before, and I would have to contact Amazon.  I did, and Amazon quickly resolved the matter.",1238025600,,996,4.45303867403315
8094673,5,B000BZ8MTU,"This 10 DVD Tennis series offers terrific insight into the game. I like Pro Jensen's teaching method of building your game from the ground up. He is always interesting and keeps your attention throughout each program. I really thought I had a decent game until I went through each of these DVDs. It was nothing but eye opening about how off my techniques really were. With the help of this set I've made numerous simple adjustments to my strokes, footwork and court strategies that have brought my game up many notches. For example the simple punch stroke as he calls it in the Volleys DVD has made me a much more consistent and accurate net player. This simple stroke keeps my ball in play where before I was constantly over swinging and hitting my Volleys out. This technique alone was worth the price of the series. I have easily come away with 5 or more game improving techniques from each DVD and when added up make for 50 plus improvements to my game. I am elated with my better play and all I can say is get the set and see for yourself how fast you can improve.",1144108800,,1069,4.404040404040404
