6937638,5,B00RZXWWQA,"The bleak tale of an outsider with no real joy or anything significant to look forward to other than getting high on pills and weed.
When we first meet Kim he's casually sitting with his dad in their tiny house cutting up a shopping bag to package small amounts of weed that he sells to skaters at the skate park. From there he makes a sale,walks around reading some of his insane poetry before spraypainting the name of his alter-ego,Shadow Zombie,on the wall of an abandoned car wash. The character of Kim/Shadow Zombie is an interesting one. Here is someone that has been doing drugs their entire adult life,is alone the majority of the time,yet seems to be a nice guy that keeps to himself and despite his unhappiness doesn't let the world stop him from being an individual.

Though the majority of the film is imbued with a desolate and depressing vibe,i don't find it depressing to watch,quite the opposite. There are things haunting Kim that never really leave. When we see him doing pills in his room and directly afterwards rather than listening to music or doing anything fun he just lays down on his bed with the fan blowing on him and does nothing with his eyes closed,i think it says a lot about the severity of his pain. When a persons misery grows so unbearable and drugs are the only escape and it reaches the point where all they want to do is get wasted and not do anything or even think. He comes to want an outer reflection of his painful situation and this is when he paints his face,gets pilled up,and becomes Shadow Zombie.

 Not sooon after becoming Shadow Zombie he sees a weird girl who also paints herself up named Cookie. He doesn't talk to her right away. He stumbles into a party in someones backyard where he meets an amputee named C.C who talks with and is nice to him,but eventually she leaves. The next day he gets the nerve to approach Cookie and they seem to hit it off. Turns out that Cookie knew him from when he was in a band called Table Snot a long time ago. They hang out for awhile and have fun seeming to connect. But Cookie appears more troubled than Shadow Zombie and pushes him away not long after they start to know one another. From this point on,with the promise of potential love or at least understanding gone,both characters sink deeper into their torment than they previously had. I don't want to give too much away but from here on out some very dark events occur.

 The music adds a lot to what is already a very interesting and original film. With a haunting almost dark ambient vibe the songs accentuate what the characters are expressing or feeling. This is something more film makers need to focus on - music that benefits the scenes and characters of the film,not just some stupid song that's popular that most people know. I think there needs to be more films like this that explores outsiders and shows the world that you don't have to be exactly like everyone else in society to be worthy or valid. Though its up for interpretation depending on who watches it,i think the idea that ""Shadow Zombie"" is trying to communicate is that while life can be utterly excruciating,especially for those that don't run with the crowd so to speak,there is power and beauty in being yourself regardless of whether others approve of you or even if they hate you your entire life.

I absolutely love this film. The plot,the music,the concepts,the actors,Shadow Zombie reading his F&*$ed writings,everything about it. I pre-ordered it before it came out after reading the description and was not disappointed at all after viewing it. I've since watched it at least 20 times. I look forward to more films from Jorge Torres Torres and/or films with Kim Filth.",1438214400,,3703,4.594553706505295

6937640,3,B00RZXWWQA,"I like this view of rural/small town poverty-striken America, grimy and desperate but trying to have a good time. I wish the scenes with the girl who dresses up like a clown were animated. Like wobbly line style on a black background. The scenes with her feel fake and take you out of the delicate reality the film creates. Then the really quite sweet love story between Kim and the woman with the prosthetic leg would feel more sincere.",1436227200,,437,4.544303797468355

6937644,4,B00RZXWWQA,"Shadow Zombie is a weird and very unique vision of a reality based character study with an underlining aspect of personal horror. Almost a documentary of insanity, or persona's lost inside their own ways. Its a film that is very hard to explain. I don't really know how to describe it, and for me being without words to describe a film is unheard of. This is equal parts surreal and equals parts imaginative.

Your main focus is Kim, who spends his days smoking weed, sniffing painkillers and selling dope. He dresses himself up in white and black makeup and calls himself the Shadow Zombie. He meets a girl who dresses as a clown called, Cookie. They hit it off, but soon Cookie has a darker side. Both characters specifically Cookie is slowly spiraling out of control into her own personal demons.

Odd and strange visions of darkness and dead people cloud the reality of both Kim and Cookie. The special effects of the visions are amazing and really look great. This is a twisted, visual experience of a dope heads, ultimate trip.

Something that ultimately shines in the film is the narration and poetry read by Kim. His character writes and reads aloud what he has written, adding an interest aspect to the film. Most of the film has the character of Kim or his alter ego, Shadow Zombie, walking around, selling weed, watching people, interacting with persons at a party. Its filmed in a documentary style that just adds to its unique appeal and often odd atmosphere.

6937645,4,B00RZXWWQA,"This was part documentary part fiction. Kim Filth is a weed smoking, pill snorting loser who lives with his father. He writes poetry and quotes it thoughout the film. I found his poetry to be depressing but prolific. If and when Kim was acting I couldn't tell. Either most of it was real or he's that good!

Some might find this rather boring or mundane but I was mesmerized by Kim Filth/Shadow Zombie ""his alter ego"" and the strange unfortunate people that we're introduced to. There is some disturbing imagery that somehow ties into the story but there was never enough explanation to know exactly what the full extent of the images were.

One of the images was explained at the end of the film, the one dealing with Kim not the bloody images that Cookie/Brandi was seeing. Brandi is a very disturbed girl who dresses up as a clown named Cookie .Shadow Zombie and Cookie have a brief stint as boyfriend /girlfriend until she loses it. He also has a love interest who is an amputee and lets him suck on her stump!

I guess I liked it so much because Kim is a real person. One with rotten teeth, a very thin frame,he's highly disfuctional and really has nothing to look forward to but more tragedy ,yet he keeps on keepin on. This isn't for everyone but if you're into realism and character studies I think you will be intrigued.",1429574400,4,1329,4.483471074380165

8696535,4,B00RZXWWQA,This movie was very enjoyable.  If you are able to relax and pay attention I think most people will become absorbed in it's strange meditative drone.

8696538,5,B00RZXWWQA,"this was a good dysphoric film telling a a story about how people try to exist, survive, cope with loss, find joy/love/meaning in the setting of a rough background (small time drug dealer living with his dad)",1454198400,,208,4.648648648648648
8696539,2,B00RZXWWQA,"All in all it's not a horibble film but it isn't good either. The story is better than the film making and that is unfortunate. The acting is subpar but expected in this sort of thing. The one truly brilliant thing in the film is the highly understated use of special effects. I won't spoil it for you but suffice it to say that the effects are definitely not what this film is about, but they do highlight it amazingly well.",1448064000,,425,4.2592592592592595
8696540,5,B00RZXWWQA,"This film deserves more attention than it is getting. By all means, it falls into the mumblecore genre and explores its usual themes of ennui, alienation, slacking, and so on. The difference is that while mumblecore films tend to be self-indulgent exercises begging the audience to relate to the woes of being an upper middle class white dude, this film is a sympathetic portrayal of someone at the margins of American society. The poetry voiceovers are angsty, crude, and adolescent, yet the film manages to effectively convey their authenticity and transmit their sentiment to the audience through exploring the subjectivity that produced them. It is by the fact that we follow Kim drifting through his fruitless, hopeless search for meaning that we get to relate to the raw angst, to both the frustration and the defeat conveyed by the narration. This is a character study that forces the audience to love the sort of character whose place in our media is often reserved for scorn and ridicule (Jerry Springer exists on the premise of turning these sort of tragedies into jokes). Shadow Zombie is a humanized portrayal of people we often refuse to look at as anything more than trash.",1446422400,2,1187,4.94
