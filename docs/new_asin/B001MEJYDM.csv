8321158,5,B001MEJYDM,"Rick procides a fantastic array of keyboards.  Gone is the Mellotron and the Hammond B3. Instead he uses a rare GEM which not only can recreate the traditional Hammond sound, but nail the large pipe organ palate.  Exciting!  Using an array of Korg and Roland keys he creates all of his other ""patches"" perfectly.  Not so fast though, he has two Mini Moogs, one in lower octaves the other in the higher. Is there any sound left?  Apparently not!

This DVD has an excellent setlist that nicely crosses Wakeman's recorded output.  Then there's the band.  This band crushes.  First, the bass player is truly otherworldly.  He messes so perfectly with the drummer whose finese on the skins and cymbals really clinches the rhythm section non-parieliel.  The guitarist is truly up to the challenge all of these masters lay down. I could go on and on...You get it though.

The only thing I could wish was better was the 4:3 aspect and the fact that this kind of sonic spectacular demands DTS-HD sound.  Forget those picky shortcomings though as the concert is filmed masterfully and the sound is definitely crystaline within it's limitations.  If you are a Wakeman fan this is an absolute must.  If you're a prog-rock lover this is simply a no-brainer.  And, if you have no previous exposure to Rick Wakeman's music this could be a real watershed moment because in the realm of prog-rock this is one definite high-point.  Rick Wakeman is a true master, a latter-day Baroque master.",1394755200,5,1473,4.781746031746032
8321159,5,B001MEJYDM,"This dvd is so good I don't know where to start. Superbly shot by a cuban TV crew at the Karl Marx Theatre in La Habana, Cuba in 2005. While the picture is 4:3 only and not better than a good normal-def tv broadcast, the fact is forgotten as the show progresses (pun intended) because the show is so emotional and the musicianship so virtuoso (with a special mention for bassist Lee Pomeroy). Rick gives the music-hungry cuban audience a sonic and visual feast they will never forget : a 140' hyper-intense show; man this dude is like 70 ? and he doesn't get tired, ever ? Got to love him !

The sound is almost flawless but for the fact Rick's keyboards come out from the left channel only which I found so annoying I switched the amp to mono to get a better sonic field, which worked out just perfectly. The 5.1 mix has considerably lower volume than its 2.0 counterpart and there's even a DTS sound option I didn't get to try. The setlist is very good, mostly old, well-known material intercalated with some obscure gems thrown in for good measure make this one of the most interesting RW DVDs ever released IMHO (although I'm still waiting for Six Wifes Live to arrive in my mailbox)",1257984000,6,1187,4.420091324200913
