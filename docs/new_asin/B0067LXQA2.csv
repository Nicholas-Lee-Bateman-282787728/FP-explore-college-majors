It begins in 18th century Spain. A beggar arrived in the town square on a public holiday. Some complain of their taxes. The beggar goes to the Marquis castle and asks for charity. The nobles mock him and give him wine; then put him in a dungeon. Years pass. A servant girl displeases the Marquis and is put in the dungeon. She cant call for help. Later she is given to the Marquis, but defends herself. She fled to the forest. She is rescued and given shelter. Afterwards she has a baby boy, then dies. A dead goat is found with its throat torn out, it must be a wolf. The hunter is ordered to kill the wolves. At night Leon went outside and was hurt; he has bad dreams. A priest explains how an evil spirit can enter a human body, such as a werewolf. Is there a cure?

People talk about a full moon attracting a werewolf. The hunter creates a silver bullet to shoot a werewolf. Young Leon is grown up and leaves home to find work. He loves the daughter of his employer but she is promised to another. Leon visits a sporting house on a Saturday night, but he feels ill (the full moon). What will happen now? Leon does not remember what happened that night. Must he be chained night and day? He runs off, the police question him. Leon wants to leave with Cristina. But the police arrest him for murder! Cristina arrives, does she know about his affliction? Will a silver bullet save Leon? The full moon causes a change in Leon! He tears down the bars and escapes jail. A crowd pursues him, he climbs a roof of the church. The bells ring, a man fires his gun and kills Leon.

Is this the worst werewolf movie youve ever seen? It was based on The Werewolf of Paris by Guy Endore, which few have read. I read that the movie legends of werewolves was created by Curt Siodmak, a screenwriter for many horror films of the 1930s-1940s. The opening scenes of the nobility remind me of The Hound of the Baskervilles.",1492387200,,1944,4.291553133514986
