6085982,4,B00GM473M6,I discovered this series on Youtube and fell in love. The quality of the dvd's also do not disappoint. The viewing is clear and sound is great. I wasn't as happy with the constant obstacles Cat and Vincent face in Season 2. The scenes with them having quality time together seem to decrease as the series progress which may have contribute to it's downfall. The chemistry between these two is great.,1469750400,,399,4.633802816901408

6086005,5,B00GM473M6,"This season was just a fun as the first one.  Also, any lingering issues or mysteries from Season 1 are quickly wrapped up in the first few episodes.  This season also keeps you guessing until the end.  It also has a satisfying ending, so you can buy it without fear of cliffhangers, and it still leaves room for a third season.",1446508800,,328,4.344262295081967

6086018,5,B00GM473M6,This is a good season filled with a lot of what it's and why's. But but I have to say I like it more towards the end of the season when Vincent and Catherine get back together with each other.  They truly belong together and seperating them is never a good idea to go.,1439510400,,268,3.962962962962963

6086022,3,B00GM473M6,I think that the writers when to for with the love triangle. it cause the show to loose views. that was not based on the original series. we loved the show because it was based on love between two different individuals that complemented each other.  the writers destroyed the integrity of what true love is about.i don't understand how the network always promote other shows but not beauty and the beast. they promote stupid shows like a grown woman chasing after a man. If it was not for beauty and the beast I would not watch cw network,1437955200,,538,4.489795918367347

6086028,5,B00GM473M6,Enjoyed this season.  I love Beauty and the Beast.  I loved the exploration into Vincent's reprogramming but disappointed that Cat didn't learn how they programmed him.. I think she would not have been so hard on him.,1436572800,,217,4.837837837837838

6086040,5,B00GM473M6,"As a huge fan of the show, I have to admit that I really wasn't a huge fan of the first half of season 2 when it was originally being aired.  However, I found that the second time around (watching it on DVD) was a much better experience because you could see more clearly what the writers were going for as far as an overall theme for the season (who am I?).  I really loved re-watching the second season and re-watching Catherine and Vincent figure out who they are as individuals and as a couple.  I think, even though I really didn't like when they were apart, that they became a much stronger couple because of it and that was clearer for me to see as I watched the second season again.  I love this show so much!!!!",1434672000,,720,4.195652173913044
6086041,5,B00GM473M6,"I first caught this show several months ago on Netflix because it was trending.  I didn't realize there was a more current remake of this classic story, but with a really cool twist!  I binge watched the first 2 seasons and thought to myself, ""I have to own this on DVD!""  I love getting to watch the deleted scenes as well as the bloopers/outtakes.  This show has a perfect mix of action/suspense and love/romance.  The lead couple are such a joy to watch together and what else can I say?  I'm completely hooked!  I just caught the season 3 premiere this past Thursday night and this show never disappoints.  I'm excited to see what's next for Catherine and Vincent, my only complaint is having to waiting a week between episodes lol.",1434326400,,736,4.564885496183206

The cast and crew are a perfect ensemble the two lead characters Vincent Catherine played my Kristin Kruek andJay Ryan are the perfect modern day epic power couple. The chemistry is off the charts. As well as the supporting cast members Nina Lisandrello and Austin Basis add the key element of humor that is the glue to this awesome show.

6086050,1,B00GM473M6,"I love this show, but I HATE that the publishers don't have even enough respect for fans to release the series on Blu-ray.  Here it is 2015, this show was filmed in high-definition, and there we the viewing public have spent a lot of money supporting the Blu-ray standard.  How dare they ignore the most loyal fans, those who respect the material enough to watch it in the most pristine format as it was originally intended?

Much like Modern Family (another series I love), I will not be purchasing more of their goods until they give me a decent HD release.  Enough is enough.

Just for the record, I OWN (i.e., I HAVE PAID GOOD MONEY FOR) almost 4,000 titles on DVD and Blu-ray.  I own a several region-free Blu-ray players, simply because so many titles are published in Blu-ray format in Europe and Asia that are ignored by their creators here in the U.S. (And what the heck is up with THAT?)  As Blu-ray editions of my favorites are released I buy them to replace the DVDs.  I would guess that something like 35% of my titles in Blu-ray format were originally released on DVD and later had to be RE-PURCHASED in BD format.  A few years ago I just gritted my teeth and took the hit, but at this late date, my friends, it is just plain wrong.

Ok, I've said my piece.  If you agree please add your voice to this message.  Best regards, Delta Foxtrot",1423180800,4,1353,4.389558232931727
6086051,4,B00GM473M6,"Why does Amazon still not have a release date for season two - ? - This was listed on another website in November:

The DVD will be out on March 15, 2015 and the product details can be found on Walmart.
Stuart Gillard, the director of Beauty and the Beast, recently revealed a new black and white image of Vincent (Jay Ryan) and Catherine (Kristin Kreuk) in action.
Catherine To Get A New Partner In Season 3
The director threw some wit into his caption for the image stating, ""it aint always black and white."" He followed this up with a different tweet revealing that shooting for episode 7 was underway and things were moving pretty fast.
Gillard has also been pretty good about keeping fans updated with behind-the-scenes images from the set of filming for season 3.
Recently he revealed new pictures featuring Vincent (Jay Ryan) and J.T. (Austin Basis).
In one of the images the duo are seen prepping for an ""intense emotional scene,"" while describing the other Gillard jokingly states that they're having a face-off.",1421884800,2,1021,4.735955056179775

6086053,5,B00GM473M6,I have loved this show since the pilot. I think it was well thought out and has dynamic twist and turns. I love to re-watch the episodes and look for hints and clues that I may have missed when it originally aired. Katherine and Vince's characters are so awesome and I love how they always find a way to come back to one another. Can't wait until the second season's DVD is released. I'm reading that they are cooking up a third season. I CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!!,1418515200,3,456,4.313953488372093
6086054,5,B00GM473M6,"Aside from ""Arrow"", this was the other show that was broadcasted on the CW in 1080i HD and 5.1 surround sound that peaked my interest in their network.

Unfortunately, it baffles me why ""Arrow"" has a Blu-ray / DVD release and yet ""Beauty and the Beast"" Season 1 and 2 have not received their Blu-ray release.  Was it to not confuse customers from the Disney Blu-ray release?  I doubt it.  I think fans and customers should let CW know that we want a Blu-ray version of the show.

Most shows released today are dual format released or Blu-ray / DVD combo packages.  People who have not seen the show in HD TV will probably not know what they are missing in terms of picture and sound quality which draw you into the story more.

Bring the Blu-ray release of this show for Season 1, 2, 3 and future seasons.

Don't make this into another DVD only release and then vanish off the air leaving us with second rate quality nostalgia.  This show deserves more respect and the crew who painstakingly spent the time on making this show deserve it to be seen in the best picture and sound quality.

Season three should be just as exciting and I truly hope we will see more episodes and seasons to come. It really is a good show give it a chance you will see. I have already had 5 friends become addicted to it like I have just by starting them on season 1. We have had weekend marathon's in order to get them up to date. Now they are anxious for S3 to start.",1414800000,,533,3.767857142857143
6086056,5,B00GM473M6,love this show!!!!!,1412553600,,19,5.666666666666667
6086057,5,B00GM473M6,"Of course. Beauty and the Beast is a classic scenario that cannot be denied.

Obviously I loved Season 1, or I would not be here commenting on Season 2!

As most of the reviewers say, the direction of the story line in Season 2 was not very well appreciated. This includes me. I kept issuing threats in my head to stop watching, but the wonderful writing team managed to resolve the issues bothering us and get the story back on track. (Side Note: This also happened in the 1980s series, and I often found myself chanting, ""I believe in the Brotherhood of Pain."")

If you haven't seen Season 1, please do so first. This second season's twists and turns will mean much more to you if you have Season 1 under your belt.

As should be said for both seasons, Kristen Kreuk (as Catherine Chandler) is an amazing actor, who has been undervalued in the past. I know that her first famous role on that Disney show didn't really require that much of her, but her years as Lana Lang on Smallville seasoned her and proved she has excellent range and talent. We see more of this in Beauty and the Beast.

Catherine's Beast, played by Jay Ryan, is a character of interest and depth played well. The chemistry between the two is amazing. Worth every minute of your precious time.

This series was based on the 1980s version starring Linda Hamilton and Ron Perlman, but be warned that the only similarities are 1. the location (New York), 2. the two main characters' names (Catherine Chandler and Vincent). Instead of an attorney in the DA's office, Catherine is an NYPD detective. Instead of a classically educated gentle man with a beastly face, Vincent is a doctor who volunteered for a special military project which was intended to create super soldiers. His face and eyes change when he has his beastly rage fits, both of which change back when he calms. I guess you could say that he's kind of a mini-Hulk. The only other similarity is that 3. they spend some time underground to avoid the mundane world and it's majority of inhabitants. Though I love this version, I don't really appreciate the names being the same, because the characters and their situations are quite different from what I can see.

B&Bs best friends are terrific characters, who stand by their friends and work hard at staying only acquaintances with each other. Of course that eventually fails and they become closer as they work together more to help keep their friends alive. JT is the resident tech genius, university professor and research biochemist. Tess is Cat's partner at the precinct and a very strong cop who does her best to get the bad guy and find justice. Tess and JT are pretty much two people you would never think to put together, but they eventually find their stride and get the job done.

I recommend this series and I hope you will be willing to check into the DVDs... or some other format of keeping this series in your life. i still go for DVDs to save hard drive space and so I can play them anywhere. I may be dragged into the current century with Blu Ray soon, but for now I am sticking to DVDs.

Be careful out there!",1409011200,10,3110,4.529411764705882
6086058,5,B00GM473M6,I love this.show! But I have to admit I hated how season 2 started and stopped watching but after a bit I started watching again and now that Kat and Vincent are back together I cannot wait for. Season 3. Was it necessary to go that far w season 2 a lot of people I know stopped watching and like me got back into it when Kat and Vincent were back in track.,1407888000,,357,3.904109589041096
6086059,4,B00GM473M6,"Honestly when the season started I was annoyed, I did not like the direction they were taking the show... But the writers knew what they were doing and brought the show back in the direction the fans wanted. I loved the humor and action this season had. The chemistry between Vince and Cat was fantastic and steamy. The Tess and TJ story line, seemed like it wouldn't work at first, but I love where it went. And Gabe... Wow! First off he was lovable and adorable and horrible all in one season... Not many characters can pull that off.... Super happy with how season 2  kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Can't wait to get this season on DVD! Can't wait for season 3!",1407628800,3,680,4.271317829457364
6086060,5,B00GM473M6,"Best show on the CW channel,we're on hiatus for now but we have a season 3 coming. Season 2 starts out slow with Vincent not knowing who Catherine is ,but the chemistry is there,he knows there's a connection between them but he just can't remember it, Catherine tries to jog his memory of who he was before Muirfield captured him. There's alot of ups & downs in season 2 & what we patiently waited for we finally get from episodes 16-22,well worth the wait. Gabe shows who the beast really is at the end of this season. We see Vincent & Catherine doing normal for a change in suburbia,somewhat awkward but funny. JT & Tess are a great couple in this season, we see how well they work together also. JT confesses to Vincent that he's the reason he became a beast. I absolutely love season 1 & season 2 & can't wait for season 3 to start.",1407024000,4,836,4.2974683544303796
6086061,5,B00GM473M6,"I have been a UK-based fan of this show since about mid-season 1. Thank God for the internet as I was able to watch the episodes I missed online and keep up to date with new episodes as they aired in Canada. Amazon's description really relates to season 1 and it's difficult to review Season 2 without 'spoiling' Season 1 but I will try.

Season 2 begins with a reunion between Detective Catherine Chandler (Kristin Kreuk) and former doctor, Vincent Keller (Jay Ryan) after a 3 month separation. Unfortunately, it's not quite the reunion Cat was hoping for due to the 'proceedures' done to Vincent whilst he's been missing. However, in true BATB style, the pull between the two is just too strong to fight and despite new baddies, beasts and ridiculous love triangles, they begin to find their way back to each other. Ryan and Kruek are well supported by the rest of the cast, namely Austin Basis, who plays Vincent's best friend J.T. Forbes and Nina Lisandrello who plays Tess Vargas, Cat's BFF and partner at the Precinct. Sendhil Ramamurphy has way too much screen time as the ambiguous A.D.A. Gabe Lowan but does a great job as the man you love to hate (for a variety of reasons). Is he a reformed character trying desparetly to make amends or 'do beasts only get worse?'

Is their love destined or is it personal choice? That is the debate. But one thing's for sure. The sizzling, on-screen chemistry between the two leads is not bettered by ANY paring on TV, ANYWHERE. It's what keeps the extensive, loyal, international fanbase watching this show. Social media, blogs and fansites abound so, if you're suffering from the off-air blues, there's plenty of gossip and tidbits to keep you going until filming starts for season 3 in late August and the sneak peeks and spoilers start being released.

If you have not seen the show, what have you been doing??? Begin with season 1 and just sit back and enjoy the most romantic show on TV right now. Watch, re-watch and wait for Season 3.",1407024000,25,1988,4.642045454545454
