8096065,5,B000C6EU58,Great series on Bible stories for kids.  Not a lot of hype and hoopla involved but the biblical truths are sound.  Long enough for my kids to watch after nap while eating a snack.  Can be pricey to buy but I only buy a few at a time.  Worth the money for sure.,1516147200,,260,3.849056603773585

8096073,5,B000C6EU58,I've been teaching my 3 year old about some of the best loved Bible characters. Among them all her favorite so far is Daniel and she asked me to get her a DVD. We have not been disappointed. The content is short enough for a 3year old's attention span yet entertaining enough for me. The message of Daniel's life is beautifully told in a way to inspire young and old time and time again.,1341014400,4,387,4.243243243243243
