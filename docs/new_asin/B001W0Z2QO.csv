8346843,5,B001W0Z2QO,"A thorough examination of the controversy surrounding the discovery, treatment, and rebuilding of the African Burial Ground in lower Manhattan. This documentary works well for the researcher, the professor, and the student alike--you can enter this narrative and learn from it regardless of your historical training. I personally most enjoyed the third part of the documentary for its archival footage of the diverse group of people who fought tirelessly to have the ground designated as a memorial.

I found this during my own graduate studies, and I am grateful now to be able to share this with my own students.",1481414400,,614,5.14

8346849,5,B001W0Z2QO,"Found this video to be a wonderful educational tool for myself and my children, and I will share it with other adults and children.  Being a native New Yorker, I was facinated with the views of ""New Amsterdam"" in the area where I worrked for about 20 years of my adult working career.  Seeing the sheep meadows, farmland and plantations was a world away from the financial district and the Wall Street of which I am very familiar.  I was also very impressed with the artistic renderings that were done for this video by my cousin Charles Lilly.",1363910400,2,544,4.530612244897959
8346850,5,B001W0Z2QO,"A solemn but great day to discover such deep history of my ancestors in my very own backyard. My 10 yr old daughter was with me and she was in awe and doing her own thing of writing her note and video taping but I was in my own moment and did not know what she did. She even voluntarily wanted her own book and picture to take back to school to share with her class.
I am glad the people fought for a burial ground to keep the memory of our people but I am also sad to know the many bodies that were dug up to build our great NYC. I pray my people will find rest for their soul. 3/6/11, a great day for me, visiting The African Burial ground with my 10 year old and my 18 year old foreign exchange student. Great DVD. Will treasure, a great keepsake, history on DVD and I will definitely purchase more as gifts for my friends and family. Love, love, love.",1299456000,3,855,3.9767441860465116
