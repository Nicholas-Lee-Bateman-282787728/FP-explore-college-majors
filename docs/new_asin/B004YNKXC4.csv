8448622,4,B004YNKXC4,Easy to understand and has a lot of information. I was able to create a website that looks professional within hours by following the instructions. It also shows the methods to customize the website to the way I want it.,1306368000,,220,4.525
8448623,4,B004YNKXC4,I think that this product is very helpful.  Some of the paragraphs/chapters are a bit long but otherwise the information is quite useful and most interesting. I look forward to getting involved with this product on a permanent basis as it is extremely hard to find work out there and if you have to pay bills you can only depend on yourself for the income.  This seems to be the new way of earning.,1305504000,,398,4.364864864864865
8448624,4,B004YNKXC4,It's hard to make money in these times. It is hard even to make money with your money in these times. The only way to get out of the slump is to have more things to sell that people would like to buy. This DVD shows you how to have one more service you can sell. More customers to you ='s more money in your pocket. Webplus is very easy to use in my opinion and the author does explain software very well. Some of info can be retrieved on Webplus support site but author gives reasons and ways to use functions to the bring in $$ and it is all on one disk. There are lots of chapters and I have not seen all of them; only the ones that I wanted/needed to see. I give it 4 stars because it is what it is described as; I take a star away for lack on indexing. Some chapters have info you could use but you would not think to find it in chapter under chapter title in question. But I don't think you could break down chapters to such a micro level but it would have been nice.,1305417600,,973,3.8944723618090453
