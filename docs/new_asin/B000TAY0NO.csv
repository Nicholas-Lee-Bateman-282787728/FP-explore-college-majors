8582255,5,B000TAY0NO,This program provides an excellent workout and utilizes the ab-doer very well. I would recommend this to anyone who has had the ab-doer and not used it often. The program is done every other day which makes it is easier to keep on track with the exercises.,1318896000,,256,4.468085106382978
