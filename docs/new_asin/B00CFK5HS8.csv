5721427,1,B00CFK5HS8,"I know these ladies have to make a living but do they have to be so filthy and degrading? I'm under 50 and still remember great female comedians like Gilda Radner, Jane curtain, and Lucy. These ladies try to get their laughs talking about their anuses, messy periods, and how they always have relations on their first date. I felt sorry for them. The Nikki lady just copied Amy's style of ending a sentence with an unexpected outcome.

Remember how the classic Lucy chocolate episode or seeing Phyllis Diller on the Tonight Show made us laugh out loud and put a smile on everyone's face? Well, here's some of the rich and timeless humor from this DVD you'll want to share with your family! ""I was walking down the street and a guy asked me for a picture. Oh, I showed him a picture alright . . . A picture of my BUNG HOLE! And let me tell you, I sure am glad I had gotten her bleached!"" So sad.",1438819200,,894,4.258823529411765

Amy Schumer is clearly the best of this lame bunch of women comics. Assuming she had something to say about choosing them, she did the rational thing and chose women who pale by comparison with her.",1432425600,,200,4.4324324324324325

5721446,2,B00CFK5HS8,"Amy Schumer's bit is as uproariously funny as you would expect from her: a mix of cutting commentary packaged as a vulgar, dim-witted sexpot, making her essentially perfect. Feinstein was not as funny as I expected; I have seen far funnier material from her, and her ""Anne of Green Gables""-voiced character is just flat out annoying. Nikki Glaser was not particularly amusing (standard girl-and-sex jokes are boring, and rape jokes are exceptionally difficult to pull off -- and she does not). Marina Fraser was just utterly forgettable.

So: Good production value plus Amy Schumer for only $5 at time of purchase? Totally worth it. Too bad the worthwhile material only lasts 15 minutes.",1406851200,4,687,5.079646017699115

5721451,4,B00CFK5HS8,Love women that can get down and dirty just like the boys when comes to humor. All the ladies were fun just thought Amy schumer set was a little shorter than I would have liked.,1402704000,,177,4.085714285714285

5721455,5,B00CFK5HS8,"So here this beautiful girl with a killer smile, wow.  She is not just the best current female comedian, she is surely the best female comedian ever and is the best current comedian period...male or female.  Her material is super racy and cutting edge which makes it all the funnier coming out of this oh my gosh i wanna nail girl next door.  The catch which i think makes it even funnier is its all a put on for the show....she obviously is the beautiful girl next door you dream of having.  Amy, when you are ready to settle down so am I.",1392595200,,540,4.213592233009709
5721456,5,B00CFK5HS8,"This is a one hour of stand up comedy and not the grindhouse film I was hoping for. Amy Schumer was by far the best in the group. She had funny one-liners that used classic misdirection. She kept me in stitches. The main problem with her act was her dress which she had to adjust after every line. Advice: Buy something that fits, you have the money.

Nikki Glaser tells jokes using a similar misdirection, but has to set them up.

Rachel Feinstein is a typical New Yorker who incorporates a Shirley Temple voice into her act that is hit and miss. With a writer she could go places.

Marina Franklin was the last and I thought weakest of the four. She had to use race in her humor with nearly every joke. She should have never been the closer.

Worth a rental. Occasional F-bomb.",1388275200,2,779,4.3517241379310345

5721459,3,B00CFK5HS8,"Schumer is hilarious, but these other women should have been directed much better and trained.  Gotta' start somewhere, but that somewhere is NOT on a show folks will pay for.
