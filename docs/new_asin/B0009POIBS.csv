8137473,4,B0009POIBS,This is a good video but it is way over priced and needs to be updated for current tools.,1409443200,,89,3.736842105263158
8137474,5,B0009POIBS,"Bill Burke lives and breathes off road driving. and as an off road driving instuctor extrordinair and camel trophy winner he is uniquely qualified to present in such a video. Informative and entertaining getting unstuck hits the nail right on the head. His rigging and winching technique is spot on. Even an old dog like me learned a few new tricks from watching Bill's presentation.  He did us all a favor by producing it.

My favorite section has to be on recovery with the Hi Lift Jack. Bill shows how to use this tool as a hand winch, which could save your butt, and save you from buying a winch!",1118016000,2,335,3.926470588235294
8137476,5,B0009POIBS,"My wife and I watched the DVD and it is great! Really informative in an easy to understand format. The concepts presented provide a very positive influence on how to approach a stuck situation and will also be a great reference piece for the recovery items one does not use that frequently.

Recently we were able to practice what we learned. We were with a group and had to winch a Defender from a stuck situation. It was pretty obvious after seeing a few people standing by a loaded wire winch cable that the group really wasn't too aware of how to safely extract the Rover. Using the 3 ""Ps"" learned from the DVD, we were able to get the Rover underway again in a safe manner.

Eventually anyone going off-highway will get stuck. How you get unstuck is the key to a fun day. The DVD UNStuck is another tool in the box to make this possible.

8137477,5,B0009POIBS,"Anyone who plans to take their 4x4 or SUV off the pavement (and why have one if you don't!)will benefit from this great DVD.  Bill Burke is a renowned off-road expert and he does a great job walking the viewer through various scenarios where you could get stuck and how to get out. A nice overview of all the various recovery equipment on the market, what it does, and how to use it..safely.  Burke's video also has great scenery from Moab, Utah to the beaches of the East Coast.  Get this DVD!",1117584000,,494,4.3478260869565215
