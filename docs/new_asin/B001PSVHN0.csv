3760526,5,B001PSVHN0,"This is a very good value for the money - Dennis Miller's seven (7) HBO Specials on three DVD's.  Some of these have never been on DVD before, and it's pretty convenient to have them all in one package.

I'm giving it five stars, mainly for value and for the inclusion of the two key specials: Mr. Miller Goes to Washington (1988), which is the very same show that (more or less, with a couple of edits) was released as the classic ""Off-White Album"" on Warner Bros. Records - this LP was a staple of my college years.  The other absolute gem here is ""The Millennium Special"", which I think was up for an Emmy or two.  It's one of the greatest comedy specials you'll ever see - consistently firing on all cylinders, hitting both highbrow historical references and some pretty lowbrow laughs (with Norm McDonald, who is a riot with his `guest' appearances throughout).  I taped this off HBO and must've watched it around 12 or 15 times over the years, and always wondered why it wasn't out on DVD.  The other specials included are ""Black and White"" (1990), ""Live From Washington DC"" (1994), ""Citizen Arcane"" (1996), ""The Raw Feed"" (2003) and ""All In"" (2006).  All specials are basically 45 min-to-one-hour in running length, ranging from very good to just ok - the two recent ones are just ok; some good gags but I'm of the opinion that Miller was a lot funnier before he decided he was a Republican, post-9/11.  He used to be a pretty acerbic equal-opportunity offender, leaning somewhat left, but in ""Raw Feed"" and ""All In"" he pretty much comes off as a hard-core Bush Republican: for better or worse, depending on your political leanings, it's preserved here for posterity.

 The picture and sound on all these are excellent - very sharp, better than other video'd standup concerts I've seen from the same era.  So despite any misgivings that some might have about his metamorphosis to the right, as of late, it's still a very worthwhile collection to have if you like(d) him and/or collect standup on DVD.  If you get this, you can skip buying the few specials that were already on DVD, and you'll have everything in one package.  Ok, Baboo?  That's just my opinion, I could be wrong.......",1240790400,18,2192,4.6450777202072535
3760527,5,B001PSVHN0,"It is about time!!!  My VHS copies of these specials are about to wear out.  Every single one is smart, funny, and full of the most obscure references you will ever find.  With DVDs of most of all the SNL Alum being released all the time, it was about time we Dennis Miller fans get some love too.  Can a Special Edition Director's Cut of BORDELLO OF BLOOD be too far behind???",1235779200,12,377,4.194444444444445
3760538,5,B001PSVHN0,I've always enjoyed Dennis Miller. Been laughing at his stuff for decades now ...... and decades to come.,1406851200,,105,4.888888888888889
3760539,5,B001PSVHN0,"After having seen most of these at various times over the years, I thought that I would enjoy having them on DVD. Nice decision on my part! I thoroughly enjoy Dennis' humor. Being a relatively ""old guy"", most of Dennis' cultural references are not lost on me, even in the earliest recordings. If you find Dennis Miller remotely entertaining, this is a good set and a real bargain. Hihgly recommended.",1389830400,3,400,4.728571428571429
3760540,5,B001PSVHN0,Dennis Miller is brilliant and so funny! He targets the issues and tells it like it is! I love this guy.,1386028800,,104,4.0
3760541,5,B001PSVHN0,Dennis Miller is an old favorite and it's been interesting to watch his transitio from liberal to conservative. These old specials will be fun to watch!,1375228800,,152,4.884615384615385
3760542,4,B001PSVHN0,"I do like Dennis Miller.  He does have a sharp wit.  Most of the material was great, some not as good, but overall, it was good.  As always I get the best service through Amazon.",1370390400,,178,4.0285714285714285
3760543,4,B001PSVHN0,"This is what i expected from the most intelligent stand-up out there, ever.  Dennis Miller ranges from the absurd to the insane as far as references go and although sometimes his references are so obscure it distracts from the purpose of comedy - to make us laugh - he more than makes up for it with punch-lines you never see coming.  And what would an hour with Dennis be without the obligatory rant?  These diatribes are classic social commentary that should be admitted to the Smithsonian.",1367366400,,492,4.6976744186046515
3760544,5,B001PSVHN0,This was a gift for my husband. We both love watching & listening to Dennis Miller. We were very happy with our purchase.,1358467200,,121,4.304347826086956
3760545,5,B001PSVHN0,"All of his quality work in one place. I thought some of the early footage was a bit ""grainy"" of course I'm compairing it to the new clear HD. It's HBO, it's raw, if you like dennis buy it.",1343952000,,188,3.8461538461538463
3760546,5,B001PSVHN0,"Like other topical humorists, some of the jokes need to be remembered in the context of the time.  But being less generic makes the humor proportionally funnier.  DM is an American Treasure.  The HBO collection is an awesome set.",1331424000,,229,4.82051282051282
3760547,5,B001PSVHN0,Great set of Dennis Miller DVD's.  A great value for your money.  Highly recommend to Dennis Miller fans.  A welcome distraction from the cares of the day.,1329868800,,155,4.666666666666667
3760558,5,B001PSVHN0,This is the good stuff.  Back when those who are now conveniently gushing over him were actually bashing him.  Oh well.  So goes the convenience complex of the audience he serves today.  Black & White and Washington DC are my favorites on here.  Would have paid the $17 for those two together.  They're that good.,1326672000,,313,4.6
3760559,1,B001PSVHN0,"Dennis MIller is a cop out.  I use to listen to him in the late 90's and enjoyed his rants.  Now he has succumbed to the ignorant right and his dialogues are the same stuff you hear on Rush and Glen's show.  Sorry Dennis...but your canned Obama slams suck, and so do you.",1290297600,2,271,4.0754716981132075
3760560,4,B001PSVHN0,"in a twenty year (almost span) we can now watch Dennis Miller de-evolve right before our very eyes. Please, someone send this set to Christin O'Donnell.
I loved Dennis and was a major fan and follower in the 90s. He was one of my top 3 heroes that I wanted to meet or be like. He was the smartest of the smart asses. And every season on HBO I was right there with him. I even have a collection of episodes from the run of the show, having few early ones, but all of the seasons in 97, 98, 99 and 00 and a few of the later seasons.
It was painful to watch Dennis shift to right of center, then further right after his HBO show ended. I can't blame an entertainer for making the call to go to the side where he thinks his bread will be better buttered.
But if you watch his HBO show, and now if you watch all of these specials back to back, you will see that by the end, something just doesn't ring true. People don't really change that much. But as a comedian, we all should have known that a lot of it was an act.
Lewis Black has replced Dennis as my favorite comic working (but then again, Dennis isn't really working that much anymore, now is he?). Black fills the void that Dennis left behind.
I miss my old hero Dennis, but at least I have the dvds of his HBO show, and soon I will have these all too.",1287273600,,1305,4.003831417624521

3760562,5,B001PSVHN0,"This is a good comedy...it is great to see Dennis Miller's progression from the beginning to now. Be warned though, sometimes Dennis makes a series of intellectual connects that only the most mentally adept can follow...he is one of the few comedians who does not depend exclusively on bathroom humor.",1252800000,6,301,5.04

Finally in one place,you now can enjoy the one and only Dennis Miller. I enjoyed watching all the dvds included in this set most of them I had never seen before

I have watched this dvd set multiple number of times and you will too. A must have for your collection.

Worth every penny I payed for the set,If just for the 1st Dennis Miller special which is included in this set.

3760565,4,B001PSVHN0,"Dennis Miller is an entirely different comedian from what I was used to when I began watching his HBO series on a regular basis.  I loved his intelligent rants.  I absolutely loved his material and his series.

Having the series and the specials on home video was always a goal of mine.  I never recorded any of it on VHS, so thankfully someone at HBO used his head and released these on DVD.  They did a good job with it.

Now, if only they could bring the series to DVD.  ;)  I know his topical humor doesn't resonate quite so much today, but things haven't changed THAT much in the world since Miller went off air.",1246406400,3,617,4.258620689655173

3760567,3,B001PSVHN0,"I love Dennis Miller as is or has become. Sort of an X-generation Mort Sahl with the O.E.D. and Rimbaud memorized. The first concert was great, then it became rather tedious, like Mr. Cool showed up, so applause and chortle. The final concert was back on track. It really seemed, politics apart, that it is a question of intellect and imagination in the service of belief as opposed to self-congratulation.",1243209600,2,406,4.814285714285714
