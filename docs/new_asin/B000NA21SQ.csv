2761905,5,B000NA21SQ,Hubby really loves the Duke and has been trying to collect as many of his movies as he can.  One more down!,1368316800,,107,3.8636363636363638
2761906,4,B000NA21SQ,"The instant video version is the colorized version.  It has background music that was the standard type in a lot of westerns, but not the type for this time period of western.  The original did not have this type of music.  The film is a bit choppy at the beginning.  However, it is the same movie with nothing cut out (at least not from what I remember).  I used to have the original movie as part of a boxed set, but I don't remember the company.  With either version, it's still a good John Wayne movie.",1363219200,2,506,4.21875
2761907,4,B000NA21SQ,"The only thing this historical movie by John Wayne (Marion Michael Morrison, who is an historical icon to this country!) lacks is length to make it one of the greatest. As it is it is a very enjoyable John Wayne movie made better by colorization!",1237334400,,246,4.488888888888889
2761908,5,B000NA21SQ,"Cold Vengeance is another in the infamous Lone Star Pictures series of B-quality Westerns, featuring the soon-to-be legendary John Wayne.  Anyone who has seen a Lone Star title before should know what to expect: a delightfully clichd plot, acting and special effects.  And you know what?  This is precisely what I want in a Western.  At the end of the day, even some of the excellent newer stuff like 3:10 to Yuma pales in comparison to Wayne's Lone Star period, precisely because these 1930s movies have so much personality, imbued by the very things these later masterpieces ""correct.""  When you sit down to watch a Western, you expect a simple plot, lots of action and a smoldering love interest.  So, grab your popcorn and your six-shooter and let fly!

One of the greatest features of this particular DVD package is its inclusion of both the newly re-mastered and colorized version and the original black and white, Dawn Rider.  This way, you don't have to choose between respecting tradition, indulging that nostalgic experience you remember from childhood or trying an innovative new way to enjoy classic films--everyone wins.  My guess is that you'll watch the film both ways, then marvel at just how distinctly different each experience feels.

All in all a winning package for the Western buff and the young cowpoke alike.",1228176000,6,1332,4.95945945945946
