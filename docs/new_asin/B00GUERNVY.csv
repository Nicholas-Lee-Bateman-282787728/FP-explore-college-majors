8627600,2,B00GUERNVY,"The film is claimed to be based on a true story...""My name is Mike and this is me story."" Mike narrates the story, dies 19 minutes into the film which doesn't prevent him from continuing to narrate. He turns into a zombie. He is killed for having killed a transgender prostitute. In fact the plot moves aimlessly along, seeming lacking direction. Troma effects. Nothing special.

If a person is dead, their heart is not beating, therefore blood sprays are not possible. Last time I watch a Guy Moore true story.
