5111339,5,B007V973KI,"Another winner!  The color is spectacular.  It's wonderful to see these programs as they were originally broadcast and not cut and peppered with commercials.  And it's so great to again hear interviews, see behind the scenes photos and the other special attractions. Not too many releases of this era have these features.  Look forward to the release of Season 4 in October and all future seasons on a timely basis.",1343088000,8,415,4.885714285714286
5111340,5,B007V973KI,"There's been many a time that I was tired of waiting and wanted to order these episodes from another source, but watching them now in full living color as I first saw them so many years ago Sunday nights on NBC makes me glad that I waited.

BONANZA is one of the greatest television series of all time, and this set is an excellent example of why. I won't comment on the quality of the many outstanding episodes as far as story, acting, direction, etc. (because all that goes without saying), but I will say if all you know of BONANZA is edited episodes you've seen on TV Land or time-compressed episodes on MeTV, or other broadcast or computer sources, you are missing out.

Each episode here is newly restored from original 35mm film materials complete with the original theme song and that beautiful peacock (at the beginning of every episode)! Most every show has extras like extensive photo galleries, and there so many special features and commentaries by performers who worked on the show that make it all worth the extra time it took for CBS Paramount Home Entertainment to release this set. The color is true (Lake Tahoe locations look spectacular!) and the sound is crystal clear (you can hear saddles creaking!).

Starting with the third season, BONANZA moved to Sunday nights and Chevrolet sponsored the entire hour. (You've heard of the expression, ""Mom, apple pie and Chevrolet""? Well, for many years, it was ""Mom, apple pie, Chevrolet and BONANZA!"") There are so many wonderful, ""cast commercials"" in this set. (If you've never seen the ""Cartwrights"" away from horses - and most of the younger fans never have - you're in for a special treat when you see the gang each take the wheel and tool around the ""Ponderosa."") So far my favorite is the commercial where they all drive up in the 1962 Chevy cars. Lorne (in the full-size Chevrolet) and Michael (in a Corvair) drive up first, Pernell is in the Corvette sports car and Dan (in the Chevy II) is saying that his is man-sized. (I believe it, too. I still drive a Chevy, by the way.)

There's another wonderful bonus I loved -- a humorous skit that Dan Blocker does with Henry Fonda and Cara Williams (a gifted comedienne who had her own TV show; she was billed as ""the next Lucille Ball"" at one time) that will take you all the way back to 1962 live television. And I love the special Christmas music and the numerous behind the scenes photos.

Watching these episodes makes me feel as though I'm a youngster again sitting in front of the TV. The easy to navigate DVD menus give me a choice between watching each complete and uncut episode without interruption or watching with the original intros (""Chevrolet Presents . . . Bow -- nan -- za!"") and Chevrolet commercials. The official release of Season 3 is well worth your money - it's a must have!

Here's a list of many of the magnificent extras, also well worth the wait and the price of this set:

Audio commentaries --
Sue Ane Langdon talks about ""The Many Faces of Gideon Flinch,"" and she still sounds as adorable as ever!
Lisa Lu narrates ""The Day of the Dragon"" and reveals the fascinating plans producer David Dortort had for her.
Audrey Dalton, ""The Lady From Baltimore,"" explains filming techniques and what it was like to kiss both Pernell Roberts and Michael Landon!
Diane Mountford shares her precious memories of the cast and her experiences working on the beloved Christmas show, ""Gabrielle.""
DVD Executive Producer and historian Andrew J. Klyde explains so many fascinating details about Pernell Roberts' favorite episode, ""The Crucible"" (and many fans agree with him; this commentary makes one of the very best shows even better).

""Tales of Nevada"" radio show excerpt - Andrew J.  Klyde again discusses the series, as does Lorne Greene's son, Chuck Greene, who lives near Lake Tahoe, Nevada.

""The New March of Dimes Presents: The Scene Stealers"" - a very funny skit with Lorne Greene and Dan Blocker (in costume as ""Ben"" and ""Hoss"") and comedy greats Buster Keaton and Ed Wynn (Wynn later guest-starred in a delightful BONANZA episode).

Photo Galleries - So many I don't know where to begin! In addition to scores of photos (many in color) taken on the set of almost every episode, you'll see pictures of Pernell Roberts and his stand-in, Betty Endicott, looking like twins (almost), shots of Dan Blocker and Pernell Roberts with an antique car they were trying to restore (not a Chevrolet!), and some of ""the Cartwrights"" making a personal appearance together at a rodeo and parade.

Thank you, decision-makers at CBS Paramount Home Entertainment, for restoring and releasing these episodes in BONANZA: The Official Third Season, and thank you, Andrew J. Klyde, for doing such a great job overseeing everything. This is the treatment all classic television programs deserve, and it doesn't get any more classic than BONANZA!",1343001600,42,4863,4.79689366786141
5111341,5,B007V973KI,"I now own all 3 seasons that have been released.  I pre-ordered Season 4 this week.  I received Season 3 this week and am so impressed with the quality and the content.  The picture is so sharp and clear.  I noticed little details that I hadn't noticed in watching the show on air.  The extras are pictures and interviews never heard or seen other places.  Whether you are already a fan or new to the show, these dvds are excellent.  I look forward to more to come.  I am so glad to see them being released on a quicker time table now!!!!",1342742400,4,538,4.205882352941177
5111342,5,B007V973KI,"When I was growing up, Sunday evening was always associated with the depressing feeling that the weekend was over and it was back to school the next day.  One of the redeeming graces of that day was ""Bonanza,"" which was a staple of viewing in our home during the early years of its network run.

The casting was cleverly geared to all demographics.  Older viewers loved watching silver-haired Ben Cartwright (Lorne Greene) impart fatherly wisdom to his sons each week while recognizing that they were adults, not kids.  Adam (Pernell Roberts) was the introspective oldest son.  Hoss (Dan Blocker), larger than life with that amazing Stetson, was a favorite of kids.  He was a gentle giant with a heart of gold, and a ready champion for the weak and/or defenseless. Little Joe (Michael Landon) was the cute youngest, often impetuous son with a quick temper but a winning smile for the ladies.  The beauty of the show is that it was a terrific ensemble piece with four major characters (itself unusual for TV Westerns of the time).

The stories took place, for the most part, on the sprawling Ponderosa ranch and nearby locations in the Nevada territory.  Assorted characters crossed paths with the Cartwrights week after week, providing drama, action, humor, as the show tackled a number of social issues, working them into solid stories rather than force feeding ""messages"" to viewers.

The third season marked the first season the show was broadcast on Sunday night (it was shown on Saturday night during Season 1 and Season 2).  In its Sunday slot, ratings soared, and the show ranked Number 1 for three seasons between 1964 and 1967. The show holds the distinction of being the first Western broadcast in color.

""Bonanza: The Official Third Season"" is a nine-disc set containing every episode from the 1961-1962 season. The show chalked up 430 episodes in its 14-season prime-time run, second only to ""Gunsmoke"" as the longest-running TV Western.

Guest stars in Season 3 include Lee Marvin, Inga Swenson, John Carradine, James Coburn, Jeff Morrow, Herschel Bernardi, Robert Culp, Arnold Stang, Dean Jones, and Vic Morrow.

Special features include original Chevrolet commercials with cast members, a clip from the ""Perry Como Kraft Music Hall,"" photo galleries, and an excerpt from the radio show ""Tales of Nevada -- Past & Present: Bonanza Days.""",1341964800,18,2352,5.012853470437018

This third year established the show""s iconic look. In the fall of 1961 nbc moved it from 7:30 sat nights to the biggest spot on the schedule...Sun 9pm. I even had to get special permission from my parents to stay up until 10pm in order to watch the show until its end. After all...school was the next morning...With this season they assumed the outfits they would wear until the end of the show's run in 1973. To help the parent company rca sell color tvs the Cartwright clan wore dozens of different colored apparel in the first two seasons.

The official release is in act the real deal, not the watered down version shown on Retro TV Network et al, which I believe are public domain copies. I love the first few seasons with a special fondness, so it is nice to have these episodes on DVD. if you love the show, get these, maybe one season at a time, but get it.  BTW, I had a time getting this. the first order, along with some other items, was stolen from my house before I retrieved  the package. someone apparently walked up pretending to live here and deliverer gave them the package.
