1551944,3,B00005JP09,"This movie could have been better. Even the story could have been better. Here is the scoop, I have adored Garfield since he was a little kitten in the comic strips when Jim Davis first started him. I read him all the time. I have some comics from Garfield saved. I went and saw this movie. I liked the original Garfield better, however the actor Bill Murray, Jennifer Love Hewitt, and Brecken Meyer come back from the original movie (Murray is the voice of Garfield, not the twin in Europe that looks like him; Hewitt plays the veternarian and Meyer plays John Arbuckle, Garfield and Odie's owner). Now, one more actor should be noted for his voice in this movie and that is Mr. Tim Currey, who voiced Prince, the European rich fat cat that looks just like Garfield. Tim Currey played in such movies as ""Clue,"" ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,"" and in the cartoon series ""Captain Planet and the Planeteers"" as Mal.

So, do I recommend this film? I am buying it, but I love Garfield. So, what I recommend is that you see it before you buy it. Just don't have your expectations to high for this movie. Hope this review helped.",1156550400,8,1125,4.434782608695652
1551945,1,B00005JP09,This was absolutely one of the worst movies ever made.  Even my 10 year old daughter was looking for the exit about half way through.  Don't waste your time or your hard-earned money!,1152748800,4,183,4.515151515151516
1551946,5,B00005JP09,"While on vacation, my husband and I decided to take our 5 children to a movie - and the newest Garfield movie was their pick. Each of our children, ages 2 - 8, enjoyed the movie thoroughly! Of course, any movie that includes talking animals is a big hit in our family - and there were plenty of them!

The scenes toward the end of the film when the two kitties are working in cahoots are the best. And you've gotta love the happy and romantic ending - just the thing to lift your spirits!

Our whole family gives this film a big ""thumbs up"", and we can't wait for the DVD release!",1152316800,25,580,4.123893805309734
1551947,4,B00005JP09,"INTRO:Garfield the fat cat eating lasagna is the funny creation of Jim Davis and is known around the world. Garfield started as a comic book in the late seventies and got into t.v show,animated movies and now real movies. Its not the first time a comic book is being made into a movie(superheros especially)and it aint the last time either. This being a sequel is i good?Has Garfield stopped eating lasagna?read on to find out.

STORYLINE:The movie starts with Garfield`s owner Jon Arbuckle going to London to ask Liz for wedding. Garfield and the dog Odie

hide in Jon`s suitcase just like in the comic book. Jon finds them and they have to stay at the hotel room and they someway get out of it. Garfield and Prince(another cat who has got a rich heritage)look exactly like each other exept their lives are different. Prince lives in royalty and Garfield in medium class. They both get lost and when they are found they are mistaken for each other,Jon takes Prince for Garfield...until Odie founds a newspaper and on it there is a picture of what appears to be Garfield living in royalty. Jon then realize that the cat he has aint Garfield and goes to get him back. Meanwhile

Lord Dargis tries to kill Garfield to get his heritage(if he woundnt have been there Dargis would own everithing).

REWIEW:I like Garfield and has always been a fan of him(i received a toy of him when i was a baby)i have books,seen t.v show,animated movie and the real movie. This second Garfield movie is funny at many ocassions and will be a hit this summer. It is a movie that families can go see and about everybody will like it. If you're looking for a fun summer comedy movie i think you got one right here with this one.

Bill Murray once again voices Garfield for this movie and does a good job. Beckin mayer is again Jon and Jenifer love-hewitt is once again Liz they do a good job and support actors as well.

There a definetly a few references that were took for this movie for exemple the animals/things/persons being mistaken for each other isn't new but they took that idea and refreshed it with something cooler.

MONEY,MONEY:The first Garfield movie was released at the same time as other`BIG TIME`movies like Shrek and didn't hit real big exept when it was released on dvd. The second one appears just before some other big time movies like `click`,`superman` and might not be that much competition for other movies. While it may not get that much money at the box-office it is still an enjoyable movie and its dvd release should be getting some attention.

OVERRAL:A fun movie of Garfield a good sequel and a very good movie if you like Garfield comic books,t.v shows or even the first movie you will like this one too the story is good and its funny.",1150675200,7,2747,4.569105691056911
1551948,5,B00005JP09,"First, I am owned myself by a cat, so I naturally enjoy anything having to do with Cats.

Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties is a happy, funny, silly movie. It is much funnier than the first Garfield movie. I think this is mainly because of Billy Connolly, who is hysterical as the ""bad"" guy in the movie.

Garfield ends up in London, and gets switched with a cat who looks just like him, and who is a Prince and has a vast estate. Billy Connolly's character wants the estate, and wants to get rid of the cat. Silly fluffy comedy then follows.

I really enjoyed it. It is light, fun and happy. Yes, it is made for children. But I think any animal lover would also enjoy this movie. Just go to see it knowing it is pure fluff, and you will have a good time.",1150588800,5,753,4.108843537414966
1551949,4,B00005JP09,"Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties, is the live-action (plus 2 animated cats) sequel to the 2004 movie basic on the 80's comic strip cat. Like the original this one has Bill Murray (A Life Aquatic, Ghostbusters, etc.) replacing (with distinction) the late Lorenzo Music, who provided the cats voice on the animated TV series and specials. Also back are the cutie but clueless would be couple Garfield's owner Jon Arbuckle, played perfectly bland by Breckin Meyer and Liz the Vet, played by Jennifer Love Hewitt.  In spite of the Dickens subtitle spoof, this one is loosely Mark Twain's Prince & the Pauper. Jon follows Liz to London, England where he plans to propose to her. The fat cat stows-away uninvited and in the perfunctory identity swap Garfield finds himself mistaken for his UK double Prince (voiced by the great Tim Curry) and lording over posh castle of four-legged subjects in his stead. The evil Lord Dargis, played by Scottish actor/comedian Bill Connolly, is next in line to inherit the estate, have evil designs to get his evil hands on the royal fortune.

This one is worth seeing if only for more Murray as Garfield. Although it is surprising that the sequel  was a theatrical release when the original opened for made most of its revenue from DVD sales. The studio is counting on the summer family pickings being slim until Superman Returns, but Garfield: ATOTK is still rated PG for some tame bathroom jokes. The studio also feels that when John Cleese is unavailable Tim Curry (Rocky Horror & the voice of Lemony Snicket's audio books) is the go-to-weird English guy, for the other pampered cat-currently-called Prince. I have no problem with that Curry is a delicious pansy-cat and  Billy Connolly (Lemony Snicket's movie, Head of the Class) is always fun. I also have no problem with the use of recycling of (classic) plots, knowing where the stories going from the get-go makes any departure or twist that much more fun.

This one, like the original is goofy, but entertaining.",1150502400,24,2000,4.853372434017595

While this movie isn't in the same class as Ice Age 1 or 2, it's still rolls right along with it's kid-centric silliness. Between Murray's sarcastic Garfield and Meyer's long-suffering Jon, the movie works. It's nice to be able to take a kid to a movie like this now-a-days knowing that no one will get shot and that the language will stay reasonably clean. There will be some folks out there who will bored by this sort of thing but then again, they should remember that this is a KID'S MOVIE. Enjoy it for what it is.",1463270400,2,661,4.338709677419355

1552507,3,B00005JP09,"I watched the first film on an airplane out of boredom, with very low expecations. I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't a painful Howard The Duck-like experience. In my life - oh, man - I have seen MANY movies that are really the pits, and the first movie hardly came close to any of them. Now, my son wanted to see the new film, and I expected that it would be quite bad - if the first one wasn't awful, surely there's a much higher chance that the sequel would be, right? Well, wrong again - the second movie was pretty all right. Taking the concept of ""sequel"" for all it's worth, the second film has two Garfields. Blasphemy? Well, apparently all of this ""the Prince and the Pauper"" stuff is worth recycling, and Garfield may or may not be related to a royal cat called Prince (if you're expecting gags riffing on his Purple-ness, there's only one - when the imposter is revealed, someone says ""he's not even `the cat formerly known as prince.'""). For the sequel there's plenty of gags on duality, two, doubles, etc. Even a great copy of the much-imitated Marx Brothers mirror gag from one of their films (A Day At The Races? A Night At The Opera? Duck Soup? Help me out here...). Of course, by the end it's all very dull, but the film is only 80 minutes long. Zen laughed his head off when Garfield farted.

1552601,4,B00005JP09,"I haven't watched Garfield part one, so I sadly have no base for comparison on this one. If I were to guess, though, I'd say that this film (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Garfield/dp/B000I9VZDY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Garfield</a>) seems to capture some of the Garfield humour of the books and cartoons, but somehow isn't the whole ticket.

Don't get me wrong - this film is very watchable, indeed I watched it all and it is basically quite a good film/ family comedy. But if you've seen a few Hollywood blockbusters, you can recognise a film that is popcorn fodder and this film definitely falls into that category.

That said, this film does have one redeeming feature - the performance of Billy Connolly. Where most of the other bits are nothing particularly special, Billy Connolly gives one of his best charactor performances as Lord Dargis. Where many of the comedy scenes involving Garfield and his doppleganger Prince would be fairly funny for children, Billy Connolly provides a performance that turns a rather dry villain into one that is genuinely funny.

And, to be fair, the plot is at least original, in that the idea of a cat inheriting an estate hasn't really featured in many films, although the 'wife swap' scenario of the plot definitely has.

So, if you're lazing about on a Sunday afternoon and this film pops on TV, it is definitely worth a watch. But is it worth renting or buying? Sadly no. Go and watch the original cartoons (e.g.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Garfield-As-Himself/dp/B002JPF9NM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Garfield: As Himself</a>), where the crafty yet slovenly charactor comes across much stronger than in the 2D version portrayed here...",1327017600,,1779,5.626865671641791

1552691,2,B00005JP09,"Yes, I was very disappointed with the first Garfield movie, but I saw both movies for a reasonable price so I bought them. While I watched the first movie again, and my opinion hadn't changed, I'd heard good things about the second Garfield movie. Plus, it's got Billy Connolly in it - where can you go wrong there?

The one plus point about this movie is Breckin Meyer doesn't appear very much. I like Breckin, but I just don't think he's the right actor to play Jon. It doesn't match what I see in my head, or the cartoons. Neither does Odie, but don't even get me started on that.

The basic, simplistic plot line goes like this: Garfield ends up in Jon's suitcase, when he follows Liz to London to propose. Garfield ends up going to see the sights, and gets confused with a rich aristoCAT (voiced by a very posh Tim Curry). The rich aristoCAT gets confused with Garfield, and each go to the wrong homes. Cue lots of mishaps, some funny moments, although few and far between, and Billy Connolly being quite unfunny.

The best thing about the DVD? The extras. You get to see THE Jim Davis draw Garfield, Odie & Pooky, and show you the steps of how to go about drawing them. He also draws a DVD exclusive comic strip, and it takes FOUR people to ink it, colour it etc. WOW! For one, three frame comic strip. The rest of the extras include your standard games, and a featurette about the animals/trainers involved in the movie.

Am I disappointed by both movies? Yes I am, I hope to god there's either not another movie, or it's a lot better. Because quite frankly, I so prefer the books or the TV shows. You just can't fault them.",1204675200,,1631,4.372937293729373

1552693,4,B00005JP09,"It is quite rare in the movie biz that a sequel surpasses the original, but this movie is an excellent example of that exception.
The movie ""Garfield: The Tail of Two Kitties"" is directed by Tim Hill. Garfield (Bill Murray) Breckin Meyer, and Jennifer Love Hewitt perform the comic genius that is Garfield 2.
Garfield is based upon the character ""Garfield"" in the Sunday strip created by Jim Davis. Much of the movie is based upon the comic book, other parts are not. For you avid comic strip readers, you'll notice many similarities between the comic strip Garfield, and the movie version of Garfield. Among them you will notice, Garfield's affinity for lasagna, his hatred of Mondays, and of course, the common, kicking of Odie off the couch. Some things strayed away from the original character version. Such as Jon Arbuckle. The comic book character portrays Jon as the nerdy, country boy kind of guy. In the second movie, Jon is portrayed as the now mature version of an 80's metal-head with a mullet. I must admit that the movie does have some flaws, but overall, this movie is an amazing adaption and of course, is fun for the entire family.",1197763200,,1148,4.7164179104477615

1552862,4,B00005JP09,"Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties is what it is, a thoroughly predictable, light-hearted comedy constructed around the old switcheroo, one of the oldest story tricks in the book.  It has no aims whatsoever beyond merely entertaining the reader for the relatively short running time of 76 or minutes.  So, yes, it's all pretty stupid, but it's also quite entertaining, and I imagine most kids would certainly love it.  I mean, who doesn't love talking animals?  And even good old Odie gets a chance to shine before all is said and done.

Here's the story in a nutshell.  Jon (Breckin Meyer) takes off to England to surprise his girlfriend Liz (Jennifer Love Hewitt), who is speaking at a conference there, and finally ask her to marry him.  Garfield and Odie manage to stow away for the ride, as Garfield is determined to put the kibosh on any wedding plans Jon might have.  As a result of some bizarre circumstances causing a case of mistaken identity, Garfield soon finds himself living as Prince, the lord and heir of Carlisle Castle.  The real Prince, meanwhile, finds his way to Jon's hands, having survived an assassination attempt by Lord Dargis (Billy Connolly), who is in line to inherit the castle after Prince's death.  Knowing that their fates are sealed if Lord Dargis takes over the castle, all the animals on the estate work to keep the charade going, just hoping that the real prince, who really is much easier to live with, can somehow make his way back to them.  Plenty of animal hijinx ensue.

I only watched this movie because of Jennifer Love Hewitt, who doesn't get all that much screen time, so I was certainly happy to discover that the film itself isn't half-bad.  The animation of Garfield is quite good, another saving grace of the film, but I much preferred watching the acting of bonafide animal performers such as the bulldog Winston (Bob Hoskins).  Still, the cast as a whole is quite good, with Tim Curry supplying the voice for Prince and Bill Murray once again standing in as the voice behind Garfield.

The film will definitely appeal more to youngsters than adults, but I don't think many adults will begrudge the time they spend watching it.  Garfield: A Tale of Two Cities is basically just fluff, but it does succeed in being entertaining fluff.",1167350400,,2281,4.736708860759494

1552866,4,B00005JP09,"Mindless but witty, silly but fun, this sequel to the first is actually a little better, thanks to a more friendly atmosphere and the antics of the barnyard animals.

Garfield is off to England when Jon decides to propose to Liz who has gone there for a sabbatical.  Just so happens he has a twin there who is veddy British, very rich and very spoiled.  When Prince inherits the castle, the dastardly relative plots to kill him and claim the prize.  Of course, Prince escapes into the sewers and is mistaken for Garfield, as is Garfield mistaken for the Prince.  They switch lives and discover the grass or litter isn't always greener.

Bill Murray is back as the voice of the irascible lasanga lover, while Tim Curry voices the elegant Prince.  They're both fine and add a lot to their roles.  Breckin Meyer and Jennifer Love Hewitt return as Jon and Liz, but their roles are so small they hardly make a strong impact.  Billy Connolly is fine as the villain, with Roger Rees and Ian Abercrombie providing regal support.

UNLESS, they too are cgi. because here is the problem. for kids that are new to garfield, they probably won't care, but for kids like me (and i'm 30), i grew up with garfield as my favorite comic strip. i watched the xmas special and i'm used to everyone in the comic having that certain big eyed, cartoony look to them. here, all you have is garfield that resembles anything from the comic strip. odie, while being a cute dog, IS A REAL DOG! ok, i have to go, so here's my point: make the entire cast CGI and take some of the stories from the comic strip and you could have a seriously long running franchise that will actually be enjoyable. i give it the 2 stars because the team of animators for garfield did EXCELLENT work. the rest of the cast is as annoying as nermal....",1161043200,2,1165,4.276018099547511
1552968,3,B00005JP09,"In spite of its underwhelming results on the US box-office, the second live-action `Garfield' is better than the first one made only two year before. CGI of the titular cat has become more refined, and the voice acting of Bill Murray is spot-on as ever. Plus, this time you got an impressive list of voice actors from the UK - Jane Horrocks, Rhys Ifans, Bob Hoskins, Richard E. Grant, and Vinnie Jones.

The film's story, which is directly from Mark Twain, is nothing great, but still serviceable as a new setting about TWO ""Garfield""s. Yes, this time we have two big, fat, laziest cats in the world, Garfield and Prince (voices from Bill Murray and Tim Curry), the latter being the heir to the vast estate, AND moreover, these cats are two exact look-alikes. When villainous Lord Dargis attempts to kill Prince, these two cats switch their places without knowing anything about each other until they join forces (with the animals on the estate) to stop Dargis' plans.

Some die-hard Garfield fans (and I am not among them) might hate this film for it is made for kids, always going for safe options. At least it looks like that when we see slapstick jokes and sight gags which are funny, but have nothing to do with the personality of Garfield. Sure, you can hear Garfield say he hates Mondays, and like eating lasagna, and so on, but he is never a cynic that you might see in comic strips. Still that is not all bad, and the gags themselves, which are borrowed from somewhere else, are pretty funny (especially the one about the `imaginary mirror' sketch, seen in one Marx Brothers classic).

Breckin Meyer and Jennifer Love Hewitt come back as Jon and Liz, the same characters they played in the first film. I know they are good actors, but I must report that they are not required to do much here. Among the humans who appear on the screen, Billy Connolly is very good as a baddie with the mannerism of comic relief, both pompous and silly at the same time, making us chuckle several times.

But the real star of the film is none other than Garfield himself as you see, and the seamless mixture of CGI-created cat and the live-action background is simply amazing. `Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties' may not be the greatest family picture or film based on the comic strip, but it is still fairly engrossing and amusing.",1160870400,3,2321,4.585542168674698

1552971,4,B00005JP09,"The plot of GARFIELD -- A TAIL OF TWO KITTIES is really overdone, but somehow the movie sparkles at times and in places.  Jon is getting ready to propose to Liz, the vet that Garfield can't stand.  On the eve of the Big Question, Liz tells Jon she has to go to England to deliver a speech.  Jon goes after her, and Garfield finagles a ride, with Odie along, of course.  In England, Prince XII -- a cat who looks suspiciously like Garfield, or else the plot wouldn't work -- discovers he's inherited a castle.  That immediately makes him the lifelong enemy of Lord Dargis, who's set to inherit everything after the cat is dead.  Then, in the middle of everything, the cats switch places.  And confusion of a most amusing sort ensues.

Garfield is the creation of cartoonist Jim Davis, and all America has fallen in love with the lasagna-loving, unkind, self-serving cat.  Voiced by Bill Murray in the previous movie, Murray returns again and does a splendid job.  Garfield was also featured in a successful Saturday morning cartoon run before becoming a computer animated series of movies.  Those cartoons are now on DVD.

The movie is an even mix of humor that soars or falls flat on its face.  There are even a few feel-good moments, such as when Garfield teaches Winston and the other animals to make lasagna.  A lot of the English landscape tends to be stock footage, but there are some good bits.  When Odie gets the attention -- and the displeasure -- of one of the royal guards at Buckingham Palace, you can't help but laugh out loud as the guard pursues Odie and Garfield, with Garfield yelling, ""The British are coming!  The British are coming!""

GARFIELD -- A TAIL OF TWO KITTIES is a good film to bring home for the kids for a Saturday treat night or a lazy Sunday afternoon.  Or even to pop into the DVD player while running back and forth on errands in the family van.  Well worth adding to the family movie vault.",1160438400,,1926,4.514450867052023
1552972,3,B00005JP09,"Garfield the Tail of 2 Kitties is surprisingly entertaining after the first film was pretty lame. This film has it's lame parts but it's a lot less lame and a lot less dead in the water as part 1 was. Bill Murray is back and with his talents wasted once again as the voice of Garfield. At least he's not 100% wasted this time though. I mean the first gave him so little to work with that he was pretty much embarrassing himself.

  In this one Jon (Breckin Meyer) goes to England to follow his g/f Liz (Jennifer Love Hewitt) who he plans on asking to marry him. Garfield and Odie  hitchhike in Jon's luggage ""of course they do or we wouldn't have a story"". While another cat who just happens to look like Garfield just got a palice left to him his owner's will. Billy Connolly plays a jealous relative that is 2nd up for the place if anything happens to the cat. So of course he trys to get of the cat. While the cat is gone the butler finds Garfield and brings him to the palice. There Garfield meets cute talking animals such as a ferrett. They know Garfield isn't the Prince as they call him but they want him to pretend so they don't get stuck with Connolly as the owner for good.

  The result is a harmless film that kids should love. Besides Murray doing a voice, you also have other talented actors such as Tim Curry, Bob Hoskins, Richard E. Grant and Vinnie Jones. This a cuter film and a better made one than the first. It's not perfect but it's less comparable to kittie litter than the first one and is almost as good as a Babe film.",1160438400,,1545,4.216949152542373

Jon Arbuckle (Breckin Meyer) wants to propose to his girfriend, Liz the vet (Jennifer Love-Hewitt), but she is moving to London to do animal rights work. Jon decides to follow her, rent a hotel and catch her there. His pet cat Garfield (voiced by Bill Murray) decides to come too, stowing away in his luggage. Meanwhile, at a famous Hall 40 miles from London, a cat named Prince (voiced by Tim Curry) has just inherited his owner's estate, chosen over the late Lady's closest living relative, her nephew Dargis (Billy Connoly). Dargis, knowing he'll inherit the stately home when the cat dies, dumps poor Prince in a river, and he floats downstream into the London sewers. Garfield and Prince have a close encounter, idenities are mistaken and lives are swapped. It's all very ""Prince and the Pauper"", except there's a giant lasagne in this story!

It's not a perfect film, not at all. The dialogue isn't spectacular, Jennifer Love Hewitt unintentionally steals the scene whenever she enters a room (in a bad way), and you can see most of the jokes coming. Still, I kind of liked it, in a so-silly-its-good kind of way. There are talking animals, great british locations, and Bill Murray (via Garfield) gets to sing, which I don't think I've heard before. Even though it is a little weak in places, it's kind of fun, I thought.

Worth a look if you're interested. Still prefer the comic strip, though.",1159660800,,1575,4.699275362318841
1552975,4,B00005JP09,"This film is very convincingly made and extremely funny. The hero is of course, Garfield, but this time, he is also supplemented by a second version of himself who happens to live in a manor house in the rural English countryside, somewhere near London. Both cats, of course, call the shots in their respective homes, at least where their own well being is concerned. Garfield 1 rules over his owner, or primary care giver (played by Breckin Mayer), as Garfield calls him and his other little puppy, Odie, in a New York apartment. Garfield 2, also called Prince, rules over the manor house and enjoys a special status over the animals living there.

It so happens that Prince inherits the manor after its' owner passes on. This enrages Lord Dargis (played by Billy Connolly) who expected to be the heir. Dargis loses no chance to get Prince out of the way. But cats have at least nine lives, if not more. Both cats work together, in tandem with Jon (Garfield's owner) and his veterinarian girlfriend (played by Jennifer Love Hewitt), and a host of other animals, to finally outwit the villainous Dargis and take over the rightful ownership of the manor. The animals in the manor are saved from being sold, or eaten and can thrive under the benign reign of Prince. Incidentally Prince ends up getting to appreciate the taste of Garfield's favourite food, lasagna.

This ridiculously funny and slapstick film is mood changing. It demonstrates what we all know on a subtle level, but have collectively forgotten, namely, that animals have rights which need to be respected as much as our own, otherwise they can also unite and collectively defeat the toughest Goliath. That a little cat, with a strong ego, and a heart of gold can be a convincing David and do it, almost by a wave of the hand. For cats, as a species, have little doubt, over their own ability to handle tricky situations, even though circumstances CAN get a little unmanageable at times. According to them, there is absolutely no need to worship human beings for the care they provide as that degenerate species, passing for a man's best friend (dog) is won't to do. Humans are to be kept in place, and allowed to be useful, as a good care-giver, for instance. They should absolutely not be allowed to get out of hand. Only the refined skills of a 'Garfield' are upto such a delicate balancing act.

My children and I enjoyed the film very much. We recommend it strongly.",1159228800,,2435,4.697892271662764
1552976,5,B00005JP09,"While on vacation last June, my husband and I decided to take our 5 children to a movie - and the newest Garfield movie was their pick. Each of our children, ages 2 - 8, enjoyed the movie thoroughly! Of course, any movie that includes talking animals is a big hit in our family - and there were plenty of them!

The scenes toward the end of the film when the two kitties are working in cahoots are the best. And you've gotta love the happy and romantic ending - just the thing to lift your spirits!

Our whole family gives this film a big ""thumbs up"", and we are looking forward to the DVD release this Fall!",1157414400,7,608,4.1440677966101696
