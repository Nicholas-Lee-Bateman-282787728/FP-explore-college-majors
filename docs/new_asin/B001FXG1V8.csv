8303002,3,B001FXG1V8,"Well, I don't regret buying the DVD however, I wish History Channel would have done better. To give just two examples: The general problem was that there was often no real story behind or there were missing parts and no questions asked i.e. ""why?"". It was often the case that you simply got some facts without questioning or deep research. Also they missed to evolve on a given chapter. The other problem I had with this set was that they often reached out to some really low level ""experts"", such as an assistant from a University in the US I never heard of.
As I said history Channel could have done much much better in their research. They don't get even close to BBC documentaries.",1329696000,2,685,4.488
8303003,5,B001FXG1V8,This set has two dvds and has several 45 minute programs. It focuses on spywork from WWII to after the collapse of the Soviet Union.,1293667200,,132,4.32
8303004,4,B001FXG1V8,"This is a good movie on the subject of spying which covers a lot of old ground ( ie: WWII) to fill up space. Still, there were some revolations in that part of the movie that were new to me and for an amature historian like me, that's rare. The present day research was very good. This movie is worth the money.",1284768000,2,311,4.032258064516129
