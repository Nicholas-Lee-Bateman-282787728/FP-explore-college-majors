8296753,4,B001E6Q0KS,Incredible footage and a horribly sekected soundtrack. Find some time to watch this footage with the sound turned off.,1473552000,,118,5.2631578947368425
8296754,4,B001E6Q0KS,Interesting to see real footage from WWI. there is no dialogue but there is music. There are panels with text tellin the viewer what they will see. It is like a silent film of old. There are a few soldiers in it who appear to get shot and killed. No gore.,1473465600,,255,4.019607843137255
8296755,3,B001E6Q0KS,"Fascinating, if not redundantly numbing archival footage taken of British troops as they fortify, parade and assemble for the 1916 Battle of the Somme.
This version was compiled and edited for a so-called abridged edition, but even so, watching this, reminded me of an endless loop of the same clips running over and over for almost two hours. What is billed as actual battle footage was restaged for the camera. Duly noted. And the fact that the viewing quality is on a sub par with a VHS tape transfer, made me yearn for a better quality version.",1468627200,,548,4.65979381443299
8296756,3,B001E6Q0KS,The original film is an incredibly important and beautiful document and this version of it is pretty impressive to watch EXCEPT it is terrible marred by the presence -- for the entire duration of the film -- of a distributor's logo in the top right corner and a useless caption across the bottom of the screen. These tactless mistakes really put a damper on what could be a near-religious experience.,1466985600,3,400,4.728571428571429
8296757,4,B001E6Q0KS,very good.,1465948800,,10,4.5
8296758,5,B001E6Q0KS,"Very interesting. Was amazed at the teamwork shown working the guns and caring for the wounded. They did a nice job with the music. The most sobering parts of all are the men marching to the trenches, with the lines stretching back as far as the eye can see. So very few of them would have made it home. And the horses-very sad. I noticed a dog in almost every newsreel.  Very touching. I hope the Imperial War Museum in the UK has more films like this that can be made available to the public.",1463529600,,494,4.2

8296760,5,B001E6Q0KS,"This is a restored copy of the original newsreel movie shown in Great Britain not long after the events shown.  This should be required viewing for all students of the history of the 20th century.  This battle/campaign marks the defining transition from the 19th to the 20th century.  Considering the age of the film and the technology available, this is an amazing film.  I got this directly from the Imperial War Museum when it first came out and was very excited to finally see it.  An excellent companion to go with the film is Pen &Sword's ""Ghosts on the Somme: Filming the Battle, June-July 1916"".  After reading this book, I could not wait until the DVD arrived.  Both are highly recommended.",1397433600,9,699,4.7272727272727275
