7389012,4,B014DMSGVU,"So here's pragmatic, career-driven businesswoman Mackenzie Warren (Lori Loughlin) inheriting her aunt's beloved Northern Lights Mountain Inn in Vermont during the holidays. Mackenzie is a New York estate appraiser, been doin' it for twenty years, so she knows something about what it would take to renovate the ramshackle place. It's gotten so run down and so rarely frequented that it's cut down its staff to two people. Faulty wiring. Crap sound system. Rampant chipped paint. And don't even try to step into that wonky elevator. Mackenzie Warren surveys her inheritance, tamps down her childhood nostalgia, and determines to sell the thing.

But here's the rub. There are these enchanted outposts scattered throughout the globe that serve as power stations to fuel Santa Claus' sleigh as he makes his annual flight around the world. The Northern Lights Mountain Inn once upon a time was such an outpost before it lost its magic. Santa tasks a cheerful young elf named Clementine (Bailee Madison) with restoring the inn's magic. To do this, she must rekindle Mackenzie's Christmas spirit, make her change her mind about selling the inn. And maybe that surly handyman and single parent Ian Hanover (Dermot Mulroney) and his adorable daughter Jenny (Ava Telek) can help some.

Northpole: Open for Christmas, an entry in Hallmark's 2015 Countdown to Christmas, makes for a bright, upbeat sequel - Hallmark knows what it's doing. The plot comes regurgitated, but no matter. It suits them viewers in the proper holiday mood. We're aware that Mackenzie won't stay the skeptic. We suspect romance between her and the handyman, never mind that Mackenzie has a habit of being always on the move and nurses a healthy commitment phobia. To quote the handyman when one of those vexing dramatic conflicts surfaces and Mackenzie seems set to amscray for better prospects: ""Of course you'll have to leave everything behind, but that's what you're good at."" Veterans Loughlin and Mulroney manage to create sparks even though the storyline is entirely predictable. I will say that, early on, when Loughlin was scoping out the contents of her inn, visions of her Garage Sale Mystery sleuth kept flitting thru my mind.

Bailee Madison reprises her role of Clementine, that pointy-eared optimist, and I'll say again that Bailee has a presence about her. It's a lot of fun watching her grow up on screen. My one knock against the movie is that I feel, like I did in the first movie, that the North Pole comes off as a shade too gaudy and treacly. But maybe that's the dour cynic in me. The endearing performances make this movie. It's by Hallmark so you know it's wholesome family fare. The kids will love it. I certainly wouldn't object to a third movie. 3.5 out of 5 stars.",1448668800,8,2756,4.94816414686825
7389013,5,B014DMSGVU,Great Christmas movie for the whole family.  We enjoy watching over and over.,1448668800,2,77,4.923076923076923
7389014,5,B014DMSGVU,"Northpole:  Open for Christmas is the second movie in what I hope will be a Christmas series tradition on the Hallmark Channel.

Bailee Madison is back again this year reprising her role as Clementine  a special elf who is sent on a special mission by Santa to help Mackenzie (Lori Loughlin) find her way back to the magic of Christmas.  When things get tough and it looks like it will all go downhill, Clementine comes up with plan after plan to make things right.

Mackenzie's aunt has left her the Northern Lights Inn, a place that Mackenzie remembers as magical during her youth.  She was so caught up in the magic of the Inn, her father never let her return and years have gone by.

Mackenzie heads to the small town inn with thoughts of selling immediately.  Instead, she discovers that there may be more to life than just work  there just may be a new life with a special role to fill.

She also discovers that someone she wasn't expecting to find -  widower Jack (Dermot Mulroney) and his young daughter Jenny (Ava Telek.)  Jack is the master carpenter that Mackenzie's aunt had come to rely on and he, along with his daughter and most of the townfolk, want to convince Mackenzie to keep the inn and give a new way of living a real chance.

This was a really lovely Hallmark Christmas movie.  I so enjoyed last year's Northpole movie, I was concerned that this year's might not be quite as good.  Instead, I think it is just as good, if not better.  Ms. Madison is as sweet and charming as ever and both Ms. Loughlin and Mr. Mulroney were excellent and believable in their growing relationship.

Hallmark has become my family's go-to station for family entertainment.  We've enjoyed their movies over the years and each year the quality gets better and better.  I'm happy to be adding this movie to my holiday list and look forward to watching it many times.",1448064000,17,1866,4.532934131736527
7389015,5,B014DMSGVU,"Northpole: Open for Christmas, think of it as ""Northpole: 2, also features Bailee ""Clementine"" Madison in the
sequel. - - - - HIGHLY recommended! - - - -
THIS movie was promised in last year's ""NORTHPOLE"" release on a Hallmark Christmas Ornament insert.
Clementine is an elf on a mission by Santa, himself. When things get tough, the tough---er, ELF---gets goin'.
Hallmark makes more than just Christmas ORNAMENTS---""They"" make memories... most often, in MOVIES.
I have re-written this SPOLER-free review because I wanted to commend Miss Madison. Bailee's ALWAYS
been MY family's favorite CHILD actress. She can be seen in, literally, dozens of TV-movies and TV-series.
She co-stars---most recently---in The Good Witch television series, and last year's ""PETE's CHRISTMAS""...
which was the last C=H=I=L=D-movie of its, out-grown, star (Zachary[ Diary of a Wimpy Kid 1-3 ]Gordon).
In THAT movie, Bailee literally grows from scene-to-scene. She's certainly got longer legs than ME, and I'm
6'5""!
It was a cheap-shot complaining that Bailee should act her age and not wear so much make-up... THOSE de-
cissions are up to her agent; make-up artist; and, her parents... in THAT order. She IS still a minor... becoming
a MAJOR star.
I dress up as THE Frankenstein Monster---as you can see by my Profile Pic---I have attached a pic with ME
and a six-foot-tall Christmas elf!",1444348800,6,1367,5.1900452488687785

7389182,5,B014DMSGVU,Another Powerful Christmas Movie just like the Original!!!:) The elf shows grownups the true meaning of Christmas and how they keep it every year the way it should be. I Love Christmas Too and I have the Christmas Spirit every year because I love to decorate and spend time with family and friends and the elf shows Lori that in this movie. I'm glad that I own this Movie!!!:),1450396800,3,376,4.463768115942029

7389186,4,B014DMSGVU,"A second unrelated Christmas movie based on the Northpole and a giddy-giggly elf on the tall side of TALL named Clementine (Bailee Madison).  In this installment, Santa has changed a lot and has no Mrs. in sight.  Theres another power problem only this time it involves power stations situated around the world that help power Santas sleigh (apparently, the reindeer don't do as much as we were taught).  One of these power stations is in trouble because its caregiver died.  All hope to resurrect it falls onto the niece of the dead sentinel.  Unfortunately, the niece (Lori Loughlin as Mackenzie) is a vagabond who doesnt like anything that ties her down, especially not an old inn in disrepair.  She wants to sell it and if that means tear it down, then so be it.  Its up to a lot of covert elves, a handyman (Dermot Mulroney), his daughter, and the sugary sweet elf Clementine to change her mind and save the inn and Santas ability to travel come this Christmas.

Pretty much what youd expect from Hallmark.  The romance goes the way of all Hallmark movies.  There are no surprises.  Its.........cute.  Very-very-very.........cute.",1449964800,4,1135,4.854166666666667

7389194,4,B014DMSGVU,"This sequel to North Pole was somewhat better since it starred Lori Loughlin rather than Ms. Thyssen whose performance was stiff and at times overacted in North Pole.  Ms. Loughlin always seems to bring a believable, homey kind of warmth to all the movies I have seen her in to date.  Even the story line was better and in addition to Ms. Loughlin, well acted by Bailey Madison.  The rating proffered here is the consensus rating of two teens, one pre-teen and a seven year old.",1449014400,10,478,4.534883720930233
7389195,4,B014DMSGVU,"A definite improvement from the first installment.  This movie seems to have found its way.  I liked it.
On another note, when Bailee is exiting the shed and Lori is zipping up her suitcase, did anyone else think it would be an excellent time to switch this to a horror movie? You can never leave after you saw Santa? Lol. Fine, it was only me.",1448841600,,344,4.276923076923077
