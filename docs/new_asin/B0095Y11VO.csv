8536349,5,B0095Y11VO,I really enjoyed this documentary. It is both humorous and informative. It is interesting to learn about how Iceland handled their financial crisis so differently from the US and how they recovered so quickly.,1374192000,,209,5.176470588235294
8536350,5,B0095Y11VO,"A documentary chronicling the contest to be Reykjavik's new Mayor. Using comedy and intelligence to change direction, Gnarr is a joy to watch. If only we could have a similar revolution in American and European politics. His laugh is infectious and his intelligence shines through. A thoroughly enjoyable romp. I wish him a stellar career taking some of the boredom out of politics. Hurray for lots of thing!",1364169600,,408,5.014705882352941
8536351,5,B0095Y11VO,"I saw this brilliant documentary on Icelandic Comedian Jon Gnarr recently, and came away impressed.  At the peak of Iceland's financial crisis, Gnarr and his friends form a political party called ""The Best Party"" to make fun of the ""kleptocracy"" that permeated Iceland's politics.  Campaigning on ludicrous platform ideals like ""a polar bear in the Reykjavik zoo"", ""free tickets to Disney for everyone"", ""a drug free parliament by 2020"", and ""Vote for us, or you will cause the destruction of Rejkjavik"", they take very little seriously.  Gnarr and his team succeed in taking down the established government, and starting a new lease on politics in the Nordic country where debt and corruption had caused massive scandals precipitated by the global financial crisis.  I came away inspired, and wishing we had politicians like this in the US.  Hilariously funny, and inspiring.  Icelandic language with English subtitles.",1347235200,5,920,5.310344827586207
