172619,2,0966579011,sorry but I did not enjoy this video at all.,955929600,2,44,3.5
172620,5,0966579011,I was half afraid to try this video after reading poor reviews. I had the goddess workout but felt that I wasn't quite understanding some of the nuances of Dolphina's movements. Joynan is an EXCELLENT teacher (I can only speak as a competant beginner). Her instruction is clear and leaves no doubt in the mind as to what each bodypart should be doing and feeling. Joynan's workout truly helps you master the basic steps before she progresses to faster versions of the same move. I am very happy with this! GET THIS VIDEO!!!,997056000,8,523,4.634408602150538
172621,4,0966579011,"I like all the dance routines but my favorite is the special dance. I was in awe with the movements and just uttered one word after watching it and that was ""WOW"".I actually ended up showing it to a friend who doesn't have any interest in bellydancing. Joynan also showed basic movements in all areas, from hips circles, arms movements, undulations etc. But if you intend to use it as workout video you will be dissappointed bec. it's not meant for that. In between showing the steps and putting it together is her dance routines. This video will be helpful if you want to use it as guide to creating your own routine. She also included the use of the cymbals and double veils on her dance routines. Joynan is an inspiring figure in how to age gracefully, she looks great for being in the fifties and my desire to learn more about belly dancing intensifies just so I could look great when I reach that age. But I don't use it that often bec. I'm into working out and I use Shamira's senseous workout, The goddess workout and The Badisha's slim down video workout. Those videos will give you a good bellydance workouts!",990921600,19,1118,4.485294117647059
172622,4,0966579011,"Joynan is a patient, easy-to-follow teacher. She demonstrates the basic belly dancing moves that will be built upon as one progresses.
I really liked her performances that punctuate each lesson - they are semi-cheesy but extremely entertaining!
Joynan made me want to learn the basics so I can move on to more complicated instruction - this is a great place to start!",984700800,4,367,4.935483870967742
172623,1,0966579011,"I dont' know if it's because I was raised as a child in the early 80's NYC Middle Eastern club scene and grew up watching some of the best bellydancers there are....but I found this tape almost laughable! First of all, aside from the dancing, the production looks like a bad public access show with distracting ""special effects"" during her ""solos"". One thing I will give it is that she shows the very *BASIC* moves and only having taken about 3 or 4 lessons on my own, I felt beyond the level of this video...I am simply a firm believer that one has to be a good DANCER to be a good teacher and well, Joynan really isn't a good dancer. Her body seems stiff at times, not really fluidly moving and undulating like it should be, even in basic moves. I wouldn't NOT recommend this video at all. Sorry Joynan...",979603200,5,807,4.3509933774834435
172624,5,0966579011,"I am new to bellydancing, having taken my first live class this past year. I am in love with this form of dance - the hypnotic movements, the way it works even the very small muscles in the back, the flexibility it encourages and the way it makes me feel during and afterwards. ""Languid"" is the best word I can come up with for it. I received Joynan's video very recently and am enjoying it immensely. She gives wonderfully clear directions concerning the basic moves, and shows them at a variety of speeds so you can see what it looks like once you have mastered a move. I also like that she puts several moves together at the end of each segment into a little dance allowing you to see it as you might use it. I also love her lessons in the use of zils and veil - areas where I really wanted some instruction. I am really looking for more of her tapes with some of the more advanced moves to add to my library. This tape was well worth the price!!",978739200,16,949,4.163043478260869
172625,2,0966579011,"Absolutely basic, it has a small sticker that says ""Basic Elements"", you don't see this until you get the video, the title should be complete"" THE ART OF BELLY DANCING WITH JOYNAN: BASIC ELEMENTS"" Dissappointing.",970012800,5,212,5.085714285714285

172627,5,0966579011,"WOW!  Can this lady really be a grandmother?  All of us here at ""Deal"" have started following the wonderful instruction in hopes that we will look like that when we are grandparents. Some of us are going  to purchase the rest of her videos, if just to watch.  Joynan - give us  more!",964310400,,283,4.264150943396227
172628,5,0966579011,I have several friends who come over to my house once a week and we work with this video.  We love it.  We intend to purchase her other 5 volums from her TV show when we master these basics. What a great teacher!,964137600,4,212,3.9069767441860463

7793900,5,0966579011,"This great, lovely woman is, indeed, one of the best our country has ever brought forth.  Joynan is graceful, elegant, talented, and a show-stopper.  She has performed world-wide to great acclaim, including in Egypt (before they banned this beautiful artform.)  Being from her area, I had the great opportunity and honor to learn belly dance under her expertise. Joynan's skill with everything from the basics to zills and veil, intricate hip movements, combinations, and isolation are second to none!  I cannot tell you how valuable this will be to your experience and knowledge base.  Buy the entire series!!!",1365379200,,611,5.1938775510204085
7793901,2,0966579011,"While Joynan does seem to be a nice, pleasant person, I really can't say that her video was for me. I have never done any belly dancing in my life, and I found it difficult to follow along with her. In the first segment (which is the only part of the video I viewed) she wears a long navy blue skirt which makes it difficult to see her hips, legs and feet and what she is doing with them. I think this video would be better for someone who does know the basic core moves of belly dancing and just wants to improve or refresh themselves on it. Probably not good for a person attempting to learn belly dancing for the first time.",1079136000,21,627,4.105691056910569
7793902,4,0966579011,"I bought this is as a beginner video.  She does explain things well, but the cabaret dance is real cheesy, so I always fast forward through it.  The production isn't the greatest either.  A good way to watch this video once you have the basic moves is to put on real belly dancing music and mute the sound on the video.  But overall still a very good beginner video to learn the basic moves.  I think putting an actual dance together requires another video that I'm in search of.",1050451200,12,479,4.337078651685394
7793903,3,0966579011,"I think that there is a problem here with everyone's reviews. No one should have put down the lady who said this video was utterly ridiculous. Because clearly there is a problem here. I bought this video expecting zil work and veil work after reading everyone's reviews. This video (which is of the same title and same photo's on the front and back) had absolutely no veil or zil work. It did include the part mentioned about the boom box and Joynan rewinding it during filming. It was of lousy production quality, and had the most horrible music I have ever heard (Well- I kind of got use to it after an hour of being subjected to it. lol).
It was also more for intermediate/advanced dancers, a beginner would be so lost if viewing this video.
On the positive side, I like Joynan. I had never been exposed to her before I bought this video and I really liked her personality. She was kind, you could tell just by listening to her. I also loved her dancing ability. I didn't think she was sloppy at all. She was very informative and the dance routine she put together for us to do (in 3 different segmants- broken up) was really quite lovely and professional looking IMO. I think the more involved with dancing we get, the harsher we judge other dancers. But, if you whipped out the choreography she did (to diff. music, please) to an audience who were not dancers themselves or even beginners, you would knock their socks off!
The segmant on Tahitian dance was fun to watch, not instructional. The Japanese dance was hmm, boring I would have to say (not instructional). Sahra REALLY stood out (though I thought she acted really space cadetish) when she did her (I would say middle eastern dance but she made it a point that belly dancing is NOT middle eastern dance when she did finally speak) dance, it was great. She was fun to watch! And her tummy coin trick was superb.
Over all, I don't regret adding this video to my library. And I definatly will be learning the choreography that Joynan does. This is NOT one of the first 5 video's I would suggest buying as a beginner, but definatly worth the price if you have just graduated from beggining classes, and are not so Neena and Veena professionally pampered that you can't grin and bear the shoddy filmanship and horrid music.",1040428800,10,2282,4.527845036319612
7793904,5,0966579011,"I have been teaching beginners for some time and we have been using this video to enhance our classes.  My students love it and I must say that I have changed my teaching style some since watching Joynan. She has helped me get over my insecurities about teachin my own classes, I just follow her instructions.
  We love this and can't say enough about it.  We bought it due to the great reviews and were very happy with the purchase.  We have gotten more than our money's worth.
  The reviewer who didn't like it must be looking at some other video or is jut interestd in promoting another group, as we can't
imagine what she is talking about. no one who has sen it in our group has anything but raves.
  We want to know how to get more advanced intruction from Joynan

7793905,4,0966579011,"I enjoy this video a great deal. It amazes me that Joynan's a grandmother and looks so great. She explains the moves clearly. Each teacher/video offers a slightly different approach, and her explanation clarifies some things that I was missing on other videos. She is very clear and has a patient, gentle and encouraging way of describing the movements and correct posture. I also like how she has segments of how to use a veil and zils, and there are a couple of dance segments, which are great. She doesn't dance or teach in cheesecake costumes, which is wonderful. My only real complaint would be I didn't care for the video effects during the dances. It was a bit too-eighties, though slight (fortunately) and I felt it didn't fully showcase her moves as well as it could have.",1016668800,4,781,4.666666666666667
7793906,4,0966579011,"To me this video is very clear, I like the fact that she took the time to show everything little by little so the student can see in detail her steps.  This helps a lot and make me fell secure that what I'm learning is done properly and make you want to go to the next level with confidence. Very well done, thank you.",1015286400,,318,3.96875
7793907,5,0966579011,"I have been a belly dancer for 12 years and over the past 5, have been in a situation which has limited the extent of continued tuition. I came across this video which had good reviews and subsequently bought it. Joynan's instruction is clear and concise. The video deals mainly with basic steps and gives an idea of how to layer move upon move once the basics have been mastered.  A useful tape for beginner aswell as for the more experienced dancer to get back to basics with.
Personally, I would like to see more symbal work",999648000,13,527,4.43298969072165
