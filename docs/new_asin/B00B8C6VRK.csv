5563043,4,B00B8C6VRK,I listened to the radio show in the 1940's. It brought fond memories of my childhood. This is not the cup of tea for those born after 1960.,1362960000,15,139,4.0
5563044,5,B00B8C6VRK,"It seems that there is a antural affinity for movies of he forties when you like old time radio (OTR) and vice versa. Gildersleeve had years of funny radio shows and it was natural they would lead to this series. If you liked the radio shows, get this.

It is fun and funny and Peavey is a scream",1362355200,30,296,4.103448275862069
5563045,5,B00B8C6VRK,"I am going to start by saying I am only 40 years old. I didn't grow up in the time of Gildersleeve but I did hear re-runs on AM radio every once in a while so I was hooked. Love the radio shows. It's a wholesome show! As for the movies? They are a bit cheesy but good none the less. Peavy is in a couple of them, and Horace Hooker is in one of them (the real Hooker from the radio show). The other Horace Hooker is in the other three I believe.",1450137600,2,444,3.734042553191489
5563046,5,B00B8C6VRK,Harold Peary and Freddie Mercer. Pure delight.,1444262400,,46,5.714285714285714
5563047,5,B00B8C6VRK,Simply too much fun on-screen to pass up.,1442534400,,41,4.25
5563048,5,B00B8C6VRK,I was skeptical of the manufactured-on-demand aspect of this collection but love Gildy so much that I decided to risk it. I was very happy to find that the prints were just fine and that even the packaging was at a professional standard. I am very pleased with this collection and urge any who are interested not to hesitate. You will almost certainly be very satisfied.,1441584000,3,370,4.621212121212121
5563049,5,B00B8C6VRK,This is one of my new favorites! I was introduced to Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve while listening to old radio shows on XM radio while driving on an 8 hour trip. I later looked it up hoping there would be movies and am not disappointed. If you like comedies from the 40's then give this a try.,1431043200,4,293,4.25

5563053,5,B00B8C6VRK,"I was born in 1941 so I certainly did not get to see these films in my local theater but my parents probably did.  Additionally as I grew up in the radio era The Great Gildersleeve was tuned in regularily on the family radio.  Years back I saw some of these films on television and hoped someday they might appear on DVD.  Warner has done a fantastic job gathering just about every film carrying the Great Gildersleeve's name into this collection.

If you've ever wondered how early television came up with the ""sit-com"" format, here's a chance to see the theatrical equivalent in some excellent prints featuring great picture and video quality.",1423699200,4,645,4.732142857142857
5563054,5,B00B8C6VRK,"The quality is nice for these.  They are not restored, of course, but as good or better than the TCM airings.
Harold Peary is an acquired taste these days.  Somehow I got hooked on the Gildersleeve radio show and fell in love with all these characters after going through all those episodes.  I had  a vague memory of watching the short lived TV show, but the original radio episodes are excellent.
The films do not seem to have the flavor of the series at first, but by the second film GILDERSLEEVE'S BAD DAY and with the original Mr. Peevy on board, these movies just took off for me.  I ended up wanting more.  There are a few films not in this set which had Peary as Gildy more or less as a gust star.  SEVEN DAYS LEAVE is one of these and it's here.
GILDERSLEEVE'S GHOST was a lot of fun for me.  If you like TOPPER RETURNS and the excellent ape suit from MONSTER AND THE GIRL, this is a must!
But again, this is not something you go into cold.  I enjoyed at least 8 seasons of the series before watching these so they were gold to me.
By the way, all the existing radio shows are easily found all over the internet.  Put them on a cdr and play them in your car on the way to work and you will get hooked like I was if you give it a chance.",1413763200,23,1245,4.044897959183674

5563057,4,B00B8C6VRK,Lots of fun to see these old movies. The quality is excellent.,1404864000,3,62,4.25
5563058,5,B00B8C6VRK,"This is a bunch of classic movies that will hold the attention of even young  people because there funny with little side  jokes  that something take a little time to hit your funny bone ,but a real good time will be had by all who like these movies from the past",1400284800,5,263,4.117647058823529
5563059,5,B00B8C6VRK,"The Great Gildersleeve came from the Fibber Mcgee and Molly radio show.  Gildersleeve is one of my favorite comedy shows from the old time radio shows.  Their were two different actors that played Gildersleeve, Harold Peary, or Willard Waterman.  These movies have Harold Peary, he was my favorite.

5563060,4,B00B8C6VRK,"I bought this for my husband because he loves listening to old time radio and really enjoys The Great Gildersleeve. We watched one movie (this is a set of 5) and found it to be just like listening to the show. If you're a fan, you will have fun with these movies!",1390521600,3,263,4.076923076923077
5563061,3,B00B8C6VRK,"I was looking forward to seeing the Gildersleeve movies, I love the radio show and thought these would take off from that.  While the characters are the same and some of the actors are the same, Gildy just didn't make it on the big screen.  The stories and acting are pretty forced and actually hard to watch.  In two of the movies they even brought in Richard LaGrange to play his Mr. Peevey character and after a while his ""Well, I wouldn't say that"" gets old and tiring.  Honestly, I'd leave it alone.",1386806400,,504,4.387096774193548

5563063,5,B00B8C6VRK,"My family tuned in ""The Great Gildersleeve"" over NBC every Thursday evening.  The show was a favorite of mine, and the movies contained in this set bring back fond memories.  Crisp, clear transfers.  Recommended for fans.",1373587200,16,221,5.083333333333333
5563064,3,B00B8C6VRK,"Interesting and a must for radio followers but the movies were made on the cheap and are not as much fun as the radio series
Nevertheless, if you are a Guildersleeve fan, you need this.",1370908800,2,185,4.314285714285714

8564090,2,B00B8C6VRK,"The packaging is professional and sealed well. The videos play at a reasonable quality for the time period. However, only four of the videos contained play. The last one, Seven Days Leave, will not play in any of my systems. I tried calling it in a computer, in a dedicated DVD player and an external DVD player attached to a different PC and it errors out. For that reason and the fact that Amazon keeps missing my Prime two day delivery guarantee. (Four times in a row in the last two months) forces me to give this product a two star rating.",1514160000,,544,4.3431372549019605
8564091,5,B00B8C6VRK,I already had 3 of these flicks and was worried about the 'Ghost' one because it seemed to me that Gildersleeve would be dead ? It had to do with his ancestors which are briefly in the film. I thought the other 3 were great but the 'Ghost' one may be the best. And you get a 5th bonus movie. All these films are very entertaining and funny. A BIG 5 STARS !!! P.S. The Great Gildersleeve was my favorite radio show as a child. I have a huge collection of the radio program's. I even supplied radio stations of old radio programs.,1504569600,2,528,4.135922330097087
