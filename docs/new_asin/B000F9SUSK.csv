8119441,3,B000F9SUSK,"These are movies created by amateurs with little or no budget.

You might find some scenes entertaining or humorous, but that
might depend on how much you paid for this 6 movie pack.

I paid exactly $1 (about 16 cents per movie) at a garage sale.
Considering the recent collapse in DVD and Bluray prices, paying
anything over 25  cents per movie in this collection, would be
somewhat of a ripoff.

Mill Creek offers movie packs that are much better than this one.
Their Pendulum Pictures movie packs are definitely the bottom
of the barrel.",1344902400,,540,4.652631578947369

8119444,1,B000F9SUSK,"I've got nothing against low budget horror films, but I have a hard time with any movie that's shot on video rather than actual film.  It just makes them look incredibly cheap and amateurish.  All six films are shot on video and look more like a group of buddies made them on a drunken weekend binge.  Lots of shaky camera work, poor sound quality, bottom rank special effects, and terrible acting.  OK...there is a lot of gore but so what...these really are not the least bit scary.  You laugh a lot at the beginning because they look just so very bad but after the first 20 minutes you end up just being bored to death.

Each movie runs around 75 minutes or so and you see a lot of the same actors turn up on these films and the other films from Pendulum pictures.  I'd really like to see them cut down on the number of movies and try to make one semi-quality film.",1170979200,10,867,4.25
8119445,1,B000F9SUSK,"We absolutely love ""b"" horror movies, but these movies are just bad. This entire collection is boring, not entertaining at all. I bought every movie in the collection & returned them all after watching 2 of them since they were so slow & ridiculous.

I'm not exaggerating when I tell you it seems as if a group of junior high school kids produced these movies. The movies were shot in a 7 foot tall basement with a video camera they must have bought at Walmart and makeup from a halloween store.

Sometimes these ""home horror"" movies can be cool- but these were not.  Seriously, I wouldn't even waste $5.00 to purchase the movie.",1170547200,5,629,4.548672566371682
8119446,5,B000F9SUSK,"These 2 disks are great. It starts off with the movie ""Slaughtered"", which is the reason I purchased this DVD in the first place.. ""Slaughtered"" is by far the best movie in this pack. It's branding a whole new catagory of horror B movies.. Goth/horror. I strongly suggest picking up this pack, it's highly entertaining and you can't beat the price!",1151539200,4,348,4.721311475409836
8119447,5,B000F9SUSK,"You need to pick this DVD up, just because it has the movie DEAD BODY MAN in it.  Its the funniest damn thing, I've ever seen on the indie level.  Pick it up and check it out.",1147910400,2,175,3.7027027027027026
