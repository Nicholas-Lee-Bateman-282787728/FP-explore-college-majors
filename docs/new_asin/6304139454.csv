804212,5,6304139454,I loved Oy to the World and I was able to see and tape it the first and only time it was shown on TV back in the 90's.

804403,5,6304139454,"As a longtime Nanny fan, I was so glad to finally see seasons four through six on DVD. This season is a little bittersweet given that its the final one,  but its a good conclusion to the series. I  also liked that all three of these seasons (4-6) were packaged the same way with an episode list and synopsis.",1519084800,,308,4.203389830508475

804407,2,6304139454,The Nanny really ran out of steam in its final season. I didn't like the direction Niles and C.C.'s characters took and pregnancy plotline wasn't a whole lot better.,1518048000,,165,4.724137931034483

804409,5,6304139454,"This set is beautifully packaged and has a bonus DVD in it that contains a conversation with Fran Drescher and Peter Marc Jacobson discussing how The Nanny was created and a chance meeting with Fran Drescher with the President of CBS on a plane to France. The discuss Fran's vision of how The Nanny should dress, the characters and the difficulty in finding the right actor's to play them, how the set should look and so much more. It was fascinating. I am so glad to have this complete set to treasure. The Nanny was so well written and so well presented. If you enjoyed The Nanny when it was on television, you will really enjoy this set.",1517616000,,640,4.432203389830509

804454,5,6304139454,"If your a fan of The Nanny and have wait for years and years for this!! You were properly as excited as I was when this came out!! Brilliant in every way possible packaging spectacular the series was finally given the release fans like me had been waiting for!! Cannot thank Shout Factory enough for finally  releasing this!! I actually had began to lose hope, after Sony abandoned releasing the remaining seasons. Could never understand why this show was so popular!! They did something similar to Just Shoot Me! as well! Began to release it got to season 3 and stopped and the releases were so far apart? Anyway again Shout Factory you guys cannot thank you enough!! The only criscism I have of the set is that on some episodes, not many only 4-5 I think due to copyrights, in the first 3 seasons some of the original audio has been changed. Like on the episode Vals Apartment Celebration by Cool and The Gang is replaced by something else? And on the episode Having his Baby the hilarious The Flinstones theme which fits so well with that scene where Fran chases the toddler in the toy car around the house is changed which makes the whole scenes much less funny. True Nanny fans who will remember the original audio will notice those changes. But other than that everything from season 3 onwards is exactly the same I believe. Anyway Im just soooooo happy to have the full show would of loved to have it on bluray but for now Ill cherish it on DVD!!",1514764800,2,1453,4.483018867924528

804580,4,6304139454,"The fashionably faultless Fran Drescher is back to bring the whole schmear to a close in this 6th and Final Season of this sitcom that ran on CBS, from 1993-99.
In addition to this 1998-99 Season, Fran finally marries the dashing British Broadway producer Maxwell Sheffield (Charles Shaughnessy), the former Miss Fine is a nanny no longer! But just as soon as Fran and Maxwell settle into marital bliss, they each announce a big production that will change the lives of the Sheffield family forever.

THE NANNY regulars co-stars Daniel Davis, Lauren Lane, Nicholle Tom, Benjamin Salisbury, and Madeline Zima join Drescher and Shaughnessy for this one last ride off into the sunset. Complete your Nanny-riffic collection with this hilarious Final Season collection which offers all 21 hilarious episodes, including the hour-long series finale that ended THE NANNY's 6-year run on CBS.",1502668800,,883,5.21830985915493

I got a bootleg from Amazon Marketplace. Like Cody Clarke's review says, check the size of your DVDs. I pulled one out, and it was 4.20 GB. For 200 minutes of video!

804801,5,6304139454,"This is the series as you know and love it, so I won't make any comments about that. The packaging is bright and vibrant, and although it may be an eyesore next to the more demure bindings of other films, it fits the Nanny's theme perfectly. The set comes well packaged, with the six seasons split into three cases, plus a handy guide with synopsis to find any episode you're looking for. Each case houses a separate partition for each DVD, rather than stacking them together.  The box is a hard cardboard and may be prone to scratching over time, so don't get too rough with it. The DVD quality is somewhere between 480p and 720p. It doesn't come off as granny and fits naturally on a flat screen, but doesn't get into the finer features of HD. Also, because it's DVD, be careful with scratching, because one wrong move can ruin a disk. Overall, I'm thoroughly satisfied with my purchase.",1491264000,,889,4.521739130434782

Where for art thou Fran?  What is this?  That widow's peak and those eyes, and all the sexy costumes changes that indicate an income miles above the salary of any real nanny?  And an atomic daughter?  Wonderful butler?  No telling people's bad taste?  These are not questions for polite discussion.  I just love watching her and all of  them.

805284,5,6304139454,"I bought the Complete Series set in May 2015, when it was first released from a different seller. At the time, I payed $93 for this set, plus tax with free shipping. This set is amazing! It has all 146 episodes, all 6 seasons, plus special features and beautiful artwork! There are 3 cases holding 2 seasons in each case (6 disks), plus a 4th case holding the bonus disk, and a beautiful booklet, that tells about each episode, and beautiful pictures throughout the show! All 6 seasons are remastered to their best quality, and are sharp and are excellent quality! No one could have played this role, other than the incomparable Fran Drescher. When I was a girl, I watched this show and was hooked after watching the first few episodes! Each of the cast members have equal opportunity in the spotlight! My only complaint, is I wish that  this show ran longer and had more seasons. They should've done atleast 9 seasons. I highly recommend buying this set! Don't think twice about it, and just buy it! I would also recommend buying a few extra copies of this Boxset, so you will always be able to watch it and enjoy! DVDs do wear out, and get scratched up after so long (even if you take care of them like gold.) So, I strongly recommend making buying the set, and an extra copy or two!

805460,5,6304139454,"It is simply impossible not to love ""The Nanny"" I became a huge fan in re-runs, seeing the first run episodes only seldom, although loving it. When the complete classic series starring Fran Drescher finally came out it was a must have. I sat down and watched all the way through as I have had with many series I fell in love with post run. The Nanny has all of the elements of a classic sit-com. Here are some details of what is included in this boxed-set:

Fran Drescher and Peter Marc Jacobson tell the real behind-the-scenes story of The Nanny in a new never-before-seen interview
Pilot  Commentary with Fran Drescher
Imaginary Friend  Commentary with Fran Drescher
I Don't Remember  Commentary with Fran Drescher
The Making of the Nanny

Fran Drescher brings to life of ""Fran"" from a door-to-door sales girl to an evolved, mature woman but never loosing her girl from Queens knack for making us love her. The supporting cast, most notably, Renee Taylor as Sylvia, Fran's mother is a hoot. She, too, evolves from the cartoon cut-out she started as into something more substantial. Guest stars abound. Joan Collins is memorable as is the Dynasty spoof. Laine Kazan as cousin ""Sheila"" chews through scenes as only she can.

Peter Mark Jacobson is both clever and genius-like in his creation, direction and production. He loves this woman, real and imagines and it shows in every single frame. I love the interviews and behind the scenes and I watch episodes again and again. No matter how down I might be on a particular day, it is never anything an episode of this outstanding series can't wash away.",1468108800,,1602,4.744604316546763

I've grown up watching The Nanny and The Golden Girls and I have always wanted to have this on DVD but it wasn't available until this past year and they both pitched in and bought it for me. Thankfully! It's so nice to finally have to chance to watch this show now as an adult and from start to finish and watch the characters grow and go through many changes. This is such a good comedy as well as romance involved. Everyone is very funny in this show and the characters are interesting. I highly recommend this show! It can be hard to watch for some people because of how different shows were back then as well as filming styles but I love this so much and will never get bored of it.

The theme songs also catchy and this show brings back so much feelings and memories from my childhood when I'd watch this with my grandparents.  It's just one of those shows that you hold on to.",1459900800,2,949,4.208791208791209

805977,5,6304139454,"To describe how thrilled I am to finally have all of the seasons of THE NANNY is beyond words.  My son & I use many of The Nanny phrases in our everyday life; One phrase that I particularly adore is:  when someone tells me;  hey, you are not laughing;  I very quietly respond:  I am too, laughing. on the inside..; where its dry.  (Season 1; Episode 10:  A Plot for Nanny)

And, how fun it is to find the bloopers in the shows:  remember the cans of food that Fran won on Jeopardy?  (Season 3, ep: 2: Franny and the Professor).  In one moment the stack is NOT even, however, when she finally counts them in front of Maxwell, the stack IS even.

OK one more, mostly because I am thrilled to be the first person to review The Final Season on Amazon.  Season 5; Episode 11:  Rash to Judgment: Fran is at the hospital, getting her shot for her allergic reaction  for her terrible itching and rashes over her body,  In one scene Frans dress is simple and black;  in another scene her black dress has fancy sequence beading on the top portion.

Thank you EVERYONE for making all the seasons of The Nanny available.  And, Fran, if you are reading this, please never forget how much your Fans STILL love you.  I own every single movie that you have made.  I wish you happiness and good health.  Congratulations on your marriage to Mr. Ayyadurai.",1458777600,8,1337,4.349593495934959

806386,3,6304139454,"I was very excited to receive The Nanny as a complete set.  It's a funny show that I have always enjoyed in reruns.  That being said, the quality of the discs themselves is excellent.  Each show is masterfully done and is fun to watch all over again.  Who could not laugh over the antics of Niles, C.C. or Miss Fine!  The bonus disc has cool extras about the show itself and the Reunion Show. Shout Factory did a great job in that area!  As for the ordering and product and receiving it, flawless.  Really great.

The issue that I have problems with, however, is the design flaw of the DVD cases.  Two seasons are housed in plastic cases making a total of three cases plus an additional case with a bonus disc. On mine, the outer plastic is torn on the outside of two of the cases and the holders inside are falling out.  It is not a problem if they are just going to sit in a family room DVD collection.  But I could not give this as a gift because of the poor presentation nor would I feel comfortable loaning them out unless they were put in a different case.  We own other Shout Factory complete series but they are packaged much differently and this is not an issue.

I think it is important for people who may want to purchase this set to be cautious and know the package design is rather flimsy. Know that and know you're getting an incredibly fun show to watch!",1452038400,6,1369,4.25968992248062

806531,5,6304139454,"I have been waiting for years for this compete set to come out.  For years we only had the first 3 years of the show out on DVD.  The Nanny is probably my favorite comedy show of all time.  Before the show aired I happened to be at a Star Trek convention and saw Daniel Davis (played Moriarty on ST:TNG and Niles on The Nanny) and he said he was going to be doing a sitcom and asked that we watch it.  I watched the first episode and fell in love.  Fran Drescher is the funniest woman on television since Lucy. She does so many of the facial expressions that made Lucy so funny but with her own spin on it.  The whole show's ensemble cast is so good.  The casting department deserves a high five.  While I loved the pairing of Mr. Sheffield and Fran I was just enamored with the possibility of Niles and CC becoming a couple.  They hated each other so much and their quips and digs at each other had me in stitches.  Niles and CC had so many great moments; from Niles dancing a la Tom Cruise in Risky Business to them waking up drunk on the sofa with Niles having lipstick all over his face and caught by Fran and Mr. Shefffield.  Probably the one scene though that makes me laugh till I cry even now though is when Mr. Sheffield has surgery and Fran is thought to be a nurse and is ordered to shave his pelvic area.  She can't get out of it so she has the can of shaving cream under the covers and it looks so risque.  The crowning moment is when Niles walks in, looks at what's going on and says with a straight face, ""Bucking for a raise?""  Funniest thing EVER!!  Buy this set of DVDs.  You will have a such a great time watching and re watching this great show!",1451260800,4,1665,4.092592592592593

806536,4,6304139454,"Thank you Shout for releasing all six seasons of this great show on DVD.  However, there is a problem and that is with the first three seasons of the series -- the seasons that Sony released commercially a few years back. Most likely due to licensing issues, many of the original music cues were replaced with inferior ""stock library"" tracks.  In many cases, some jokes are lost due to this change -- for example substituting the original theme of ""That Girl""  that was used in an episode with some generic tune.  This really ruins so many truly funny moments.  However, seasons four through six, released here for the first time ever, seem to be completely intact (to the best of my knowledge) with all of the original music cues that were used  when the show first aired on CBS in the 1990s.",1450137600,10,793,4.549295774647887

806629,5,6304139454,"Finally we have the complete set of this great show.  This is one of the best put together box sets I've ever seen.  The quality is great, the discs and transfers of the episodes as well as the sound quality are all perfect.  All the episodes are full length and unedited, which was awesome, there were some moments we had never seen before.  The packaging is fantastic, if you've ever bought a complete series box set before than you know that sometimes the packaging can really suck.  Sometimes it can scratch the discs, sometimes it won't sit on the shelf right and end up getting damaged, I'm sure you all have your own horror stories when it comes to this subject.  The packaging for this is not like that.  The seasons come in modified regular DVD cases, two seasons for each case, all the discs have their own spaces.  And all three seasons cases and the bonus disc as well as the small booklet are held in this great really thick cardboard box that's pretty much perfect and it's the size of regular DVDs.  I know first hand that it can stand to be dropped a few times with no damage.  When it comes to special features, while there's a bonus disc, there's still not a lot.  They got Fran Drescher to do some episode commentaries, it's only on three episodes though all of which are in the first season.  I wish she had done some more on episodes from other seasons.  The bonus disc does indeed have the Nanny Reunion A Nosh to Remember special, oddly enough as a bonus on the bonus disc.  Along with three behind the scenes features.  It's nice to have the special even though Daniel Davis isn't in it.  The features shed some light on what went on behind the scenes and how the series was picked up by CBS.

It's a great show, with great jokes, and anyone that puts the actors down for their performance in this television show has clearly never watched a 90's sitcom in their lives. It's no worse than the acting in Full House. The bonus disc does include ""A Nosh to Remember"", which wasn't really what I expected it to be, but it's still worth a watch, it was nice to see all of the actors together again (except for Daniel Davis :( ) . Fran Drescher is a role model for me, possibly because she reminds me a little of my deceased mother who was raised in Brooklyn (and eventually went on to live in a two story house on Long Island ;) - although not Great Neck). Definitely worth the purchase, I would recommend this set to anyone who likes sitcoms or Fran. It arrived as expected, right on time with no damage and great packaging. The quality was not updated for the DVD release, it was the same quality that you would expect from the 90's, but much better quality than YouTube.",1442880000,,1051,4.340101522842639

807131,5,6304139454,"Things I liked about this set...  Season 4 to 6 finally released...  I believe there are a few issues with music rights.  So a few episodes might be cut...  But for the most part I haven't noticed anything...  The box set comes with a extras DVD.  It has two interviews, the Making of the Nanny from the Season 1 DVD box set, and the Nanny Reunion.  The reunion is not mentioned anywhere.  So I think it was a last minute addition.

What I didn't like was the 3 audio commentaries, I think are the same as the original DVD Season 1 box set.  So that was disappointing.  They could have a least done a new one for the series finale.

So that being said, if you already have seasons 1 to 3 on DVD, and can wait, grab seasons 4 to 6 when they come out individually.  Or if you get the box set for under $80, grab it.  The individual season 4 to 6 will probably be more than $80 with shipping...

Second, it completely screws season 3 music. Val's Apartment and Having his Baby are the two worst offenders, and completely ruins the gag in the latter. Having His Baby is SUPPOSED to use the opening to The Flintstones (but does something else completely), and Val's Apartment also takes a hit.

On the flip side, the good thing about this set it it includes the animated Oy to the World (which I can't find anywhere, and it's never shown on T.V.)",1438819200,3,592,4.5327102803738315

I immediately went to season three to check to see if all of the crappy music replacements that Sony used in their release were still there. Sadly, the answer is yes, they same music replacements are still there. ""Pen Pal"", ""Val's Apartment"", ""Having His Baby, ""Shopaholic"",  ""The Hockey Show"" and ""A Pup In Paris"" all have music replacements BUT season 4 so far seems to be all intact! ""An Affair To Dismember"" HAD to have that Andy Gibb/Bee Gees song in it because you could tell that's what Fran was thinking when she was about to leave Maxwell to marry Nigel. The youtube versions had that song muted so I was worried. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the music changes. I must admit though, the changes are there ONLY because the original Sony season 3 release had those music changes. I HATE music changes!!

It even features ""A Nosh To a Remember"" - the reunion at Fran's house.  It is not mentioned in the advertising so it was a nice surprise.  They are complete shows.  I've been watching The Nanny on reruns on TV Land and you tube and of course portions of the shows were deleted to shorten the time.  I had forgotten what the whole shows were like.  With the original shows it now ties them in together better because you can definitely see the gaps on the reruns.  I didn't have the first 3 seasons so this was a gift to myself and definitely with it.  I pre-ordered from Charlie Shaughnessy's Amazon site so portions of the sale goes to the Diabetes Research (check out his website, it's great).  I previously ordered The Nanny (before this was announced) from DVD Entertainment and was so disappointed.  The quality was not good.  It's like they just videotaped the shows and put on disc.  It was about half the cost so you get what you pay for.  As soon as I knew this was out I ordered and was not disappointed.  You will not be disappointed by buying this!!  If I have a complaint it is that in a couple of the shows the music is not the same, but it does not take away from,the show one bit.  They inserted appropriate music.  It's just that I knew what the music should have been.  I asked Peter Marc Jacobson and he said it was probably because of music license issues.  Maybe too because Sony did not put these out.

What I like too is that they included the Season 3 Valentine's show ""Love Is a Many Blundered Thing"" that is never on reruns or you tube.  And....on you tube the shows have muted parts which I never understood why.  Now, everything is as the way it was shown on T V.  It's so sad the show had to end but Peter and Fran explain why on the bonus feature.

The packaging is great, the DVDs are packaged great, there's a booklet that explains each episode with pictures if the shows.  Shout did a great job and I would definitely buy from them again.",1434067200,9,2132,4.30478589420655

807799,5,6304139454,"I had only seen a few scenes of this show before purchasing the series, but after watching the first few episodes of this DVD set I was gob-smacked by the high quality appearance of the episodes. They are as close to HD as you can get a DVD to look. The sets are lavishly decorated, beautifully color coordinated, and so sharp and clear in both foreground and background objects that it is also close to a 3 dimensional look. I have had a check look at some scenes from each season and the high standard is maintained throughout.

I like the characters from the beginning and am looking forward to enjoying the complete series. This is a series reproduced to the highest standards possible in DVD.",1433894400,7,697,4.531746031746032

Another  one was the two part episode where Fran and Maxwell got married. Like I said this is a funny show and a good show. You should get it.,1433721600,,361,4.028169014084507

Now, if Shout Factory will get the rights for all 9 seasons of The Beverly Hillbillies, my life will be complete. This Boxset contains ALL 6 seasons of The Nanny, Beautifully remastered on 18 DVDs, plus a Bonus DVD with hours of material, and a booklet with a description of each episode!! Even if you did buy the original 3 seasons from Sony, this Boxset is so worth the price for the quality, the episodes are uncut, and it is worth 10X the asking price. If you haven't got this set yet, GET IT!!!!!! It's Binge watching. I received my set on the 26th, started on Season 1 again and am already in the middle of Season 3.

807856,5,6304139454,"""The Nanny named Fran"" is the genius creation of Fran Drescher.  Nobody else could play Fran Fine, the delightful sexy nanny that we have all grown to love and love more.  She is sweet, not always the brightest thinker, very beautiful and sexy, has a nasely voice, looks great in the shortest colorful dresses ever, and a big heart of gold.  If you do not fall madly in love with Fran Fine in the first episode, you are dead inside.  If you do not laugh through every episode, you have no sense of humor of any kind.

Fran Drescher may have been the main character, but the entire cast were equal as stars.  Every cast member had memorable lines and center screen positions to give each one an equal shot at the spotlight.  The show would not have been the same if any one of them had left the show.  The Nanny was one of the few comedies done with intelligent humor that made sense and produce the funniest dialogue that TV has not shown us for many years.  They don't make comedies like this anymore.

I have to give a shout out to Shout Factory for their expert packaging of this series.  Every disc is clean, Every episode is in crystal clear sharp picture with vivid color and perfect contrast.  Every episode is in full Dolby Stereo 2.0 with the highest audio quality.  The audiophile and videophile in me is very pleased with the DVD quality.  The series was done in the old 480 line, 4 x 3 standard video and 2 channel stereo sound.  And they were transferd to DVD so well that certain scenes come close to HD quality

The packaging is also genius.  Two seasons per DVD box.  Three discs per season in a regular sized DVD case with 2 flip trays that hold and separate each disc from the others.  Easy to access and they can not get scratches  Three DVD cases holding all 6 seasons in one very nice and solid cardboard box sleeve.

There is also a bonus disc with the making of the Nanny.  Plus a full color booklet showing every episode title and a program description of each episode, with photos.  You can not ask for a more professional packaging.  Shout Factory should teach the other video producers how it is supposed to be done right.

Thank you to Shout Factory for giving us the Nanny with such high quality standards.  And thank you to Fran Drescher for her wonderful creation and warming our hearts for the original 6 years of the show.  And now she will warm our hearts for many years to come thanks to Shout Factory.",1433289600,14,2437,4.381696428571429

807858,5,6304139454,"I can't believe they FINALLY came out with this box set....I haven't had a chance to watch it yet but it's a beautiful box set! There are separate DVD holders that have 2 seasons in each PLUS a special DVD with a SPECIAL Behind the Scenes Bonus Disc as well as a little booklet that tells you every episode shown on each disc! Sturdy DVD holder and just an over-all lovely set!! I happened to have Pre-ordered this box set which anyone who buys a lot of DVDs from Amazon knows they DO STAND BEHIND their policy that you WILL get the lowest price at the time of release. When I Pre-ordered this box set earlier this year, it was over $110.00 & by the time it released, it was just a little over $80.00 so again....if you truly love any DVD, single or Box Set, it is a VERY GOOD IDEA to Pre-order them since the prices can & will jump up again a day or two after release, but rest assured....they will come down in price again, you may just have to wait a bit.  Overall, I couldn't be more pleased with this box set!",1433203200,3,1014,4.147208121827411

The box set is very cute and I'm happy they included a booklet with the episode names (which are also on the DVD inserts) and episode summaries.  The cases are cute and well put together, and the box is sturdy.  My -only- teeny tiny let down was that the only bloopers we see are a few at the end of select episodes.  I was hoping they would put bloopers together on the bonus disc, but no. v_v  Otherwise, The Nanny encompassed my whole weekend after I received it in the mail, and I have no regrets!

I also watched all of the bonus features which include about 50 mins of new interview material.

If you have never watched it, It really is a must see.
This was one of the top shows from 1993 til 1999.
Wow, a time before a lot of computers on the internet which was opened up in 1990.
A totally different world back then.
I did not get a computer til much later so I had plenty of time to watch the classic tv shows like this one.

They are neatly separated. Also, each box contains artwork inside just adding to this colorful set! There is also a bonus disc with behind the scenes and never before seen interviews and a  pamphlet with a description of each episode and photographs of the actors and guest stars throughout the series.

808058,5,6304139454,"Now I have not watched the first three seasons on the set since I have the previous releases, but I have watched seasons 4, 5, and 6.  Overall, they are very nice.  The video and audio are decent (I'm not that picky on that), and the show is just as good as I remember.  It is a good set for the price and even comes with the lifetime reunion as an unlisted bonus feature.  My only complaint is something went wrong when they transferred season 4.  Most season 4 episodes have something at the top of the screen (some lines or disfigurement like you would see on a vhs tape).  This is noticeable on widescreen tvs but not on full screen tvs.  It is a little annoying but it does not take away from the video.  It is basically a minor distraction.  This is why I gave it 4 stars.  Overall it is a great set, even with this minor problem.  I love it and am thrilled to finally have the whole series on dvd.  Thank you Shout Factory for making this possible.

Note 5/2017: I wanted to note something new I noticed.  The picture disfigurement problem is only on some tvs.  I got a new widescreen tv and the problem no longer exists.  Due to the fact the problem appears to be the tv I upgraded my rating to 5 stars.",1430784000,19,1211,4.155172413793103

Another partially owned set abandoned by the distributors after mega profits then fans are expected to pony up money to complete the set while paying for product/seasons they have already paid more than market value for.  This is where i draw the line...The Nanny was a fun show its first three maybe four seasons but it as they say 'jumped the shark' somewhere in season four if not before.

While I may have purchased individual seasons to complete a collection I refuse to again be made to duplicate purchases because SHOUT buys the rights or these final seasons from the original distributor.",1429401600,4,766,4.7443609022556394

I DVR'd all episodes I could find, missing several that weren't aired as reruns. Now with release of entire series, I couldn't be happier. I do agree it's a rip-off having to buy the entire series, but I suppose they are taking advantage of a situation. Should we expect more from Shout! Factory or any other company that sees a way to screw the public for profit? No, corporate ethics are dead. I'm just happy to get Seasons 4-6.",1426377600,4,600,4.31858407079646

For those complaining that they already own seasons and have been waiting for just the last three, I'd argue that this series is finally getting the treatment it deserves with great looking packaging, and most likely great transfers from Shout Factory. Price wise, the series was cheapened before with it's $5 re-releases from Mill Creek Entertainment and full seasons being shoved onto two discs. Each season should be spread across on three discs, averaging around 8 episodes a disc, or <3 hours of content per disc, which should increase quality. This is for collectors and die hard fans. Shout Factory isn't going to release individual seasons that are unlikely to sell because they know that most people are more than likely just going to purchase the entire series.",1423440000,14,905,4.915032679738562

I'll probably end up buying the whole set if individual seasons aren't released in a reasonable timeframe but come on Shout, release the last three seasons as a box set and a lot of fans will buy them immediately and we will be Shout fans for life.",1421366400,9,558,4.157407407407407
808453,5,6304139454,"YES! Thank You, Shout Factory for getting the rest of the rights for The Nanny. Hopefully Shout Factory release the rest of the episodes un-edited which was the reason why Sony didn't release season 4-6 because of rights issues and Season 3 DVD had music/minimal edit. Wishing for bonus features (interviews, commentaries, behind-the-scenes) or at least get The Nanny reunion which aired in 2004 but not getting my hopes up. Can't wait for more Nanny Fine, C.C., and Niles!

EDIT:

The Nanny Reunion is included!!!! It's on the bonus disc (hidden feature) because it wasn't mention on the press release.",1421193600,28,603,5.02
