Natalia Makarova and Anthony Dowell are mature dancers who have spent a lifetime deepening their interpretations of this ballet.  Makarova has a tendency to overplay the legato sections of the adagio pas de deux to the point of distorting the music, but she makes up for it with her beautiful plastique.  However, the music should not be degraged to accommodate her.  This should not be seen as a negative to buying and enjoying this wonderful performance.  Basheva",1012953600,10,528,5.022988505747127
218752,5,6300175170,"There have been many performances of Swan Lake by various corps, and this Royal Ballet version is outstanding among them.
I didn't realized how much more dancers could shine when they meet the right partner, until I saw this Swan Lake.
Makarova and Dowell were truely there for each other. Thanks to their wondeful partnership, the second act was beautiful and the third act was bewitching.
I've read some articles describing their excellent partnership in Giselle, and I only wish I could have had a chance to see more of their performances.
Well known story, very familiar music, and popular images of swans donned featherlike tutu.. but that's not everything in Swan Lake. And that's why every performance of Swan Lake is unique.
In this Royal Ballet version, Makarova and Dowell made unforgettable portraits of Odette/Odile and Siegfried to be remembered and cherished by all Swan Lake lovers.",1003190400,25,897,5.0675675675675675

Emotion between the two lovers is the fundamental element in such a romantic story but it has almost been forgotten by other dancers, including the famous Fonteyn and Nureyev.

218756,5,6300175170,"This was the first ""Swan Lake"" I ever saw and one of the greatest revelations of my life. The story of the enchanted Swan Queen and the prince who fails to save her because of the interjection of the evil sorcerer is absolutely incredibly set to ballet with the Royal Ballet's matchless dancers. In the leading dual role of Odette\Odile, Natalia Makarova is spellbinding. As Odette, her fragility and tenderness--not to mention her impeccable dancing--always bring a catch into my throat, and her resemblance to a swan is remarkably realistic; as Odile, she is a sinuous, leering seductress who makes me tremble as she triumphantly entraps her helpless partner. The said partner, Anthony Dowell, is a truly remarkable Prince Siegfried. His famous cleanliness and precision of movement cannot be mistaken or ignored, and his dramatic abilities are prodigious. This pair is so wonderful that they dominate the ballet--the first-act dances never seem boring, but once the connection is made between the leading couple I am so enthralled that I can hardly sit through anything else from an eagerness to see them again. I must admit, though, that the swans' dances are the most exquisite example of corps de ballet dancing that I have ever seen. The first time I saw this video, my heart and breath were stopped; now, about a hundred times later, it still has the power to move me profoundly, although I know it by heart. This video is a true example of classical ballet at its greatest and a wonderful first ""Swan Lake.""",987811200,15,1516,4.902723735408561

218955,4,6300175170,"The 1990 film of Swan Lake starring Yulia Makhalina and Igor Zelensky and conducted by Viktor Fedotov is valuable for its superb performances, for presenting Swan Lake as it was staged during the years of the Soviet Union, and as a document of how effectively and thoroughly Stalin controlled ballet and film as propaganda for the state.

Because this Swan Lake originates from what was then known as the Kirov Ballet in what was then was known as Leningrad, and because it is a film rather than a live performance, the dancing and orchestral execution score a perfect 10. With the retakes afforded by film and the downtime allowed between filming sessions, Makhalina has no trouble twirling off Odile's 32 fouetts, to cite but one obvious example.

The absence of a live audience, however, results in uneasy silences when poses are held at the end of numbers -- silences that would ordinarily be filled by applause but which here leave an awkward void. This might bother some viewers more than others.

What bothers me more is the production's so-called ""happy"" ending, made ""traditional"" during the Stalin era. The conclusion of the 1895 Petipa/Ivanov revival of Swan Lake -- the real traditional version -- ends with the suicides of both Odette and Siegfried. Having Siegfried and his Swan Queen instead live happily ever after is like having Romeo and Juliet miraculously come back to life.

How did this new ""traditional"" ending for Swan Lake come about?

Politics and ballet have been inextricably entwined in Russia since the Imperial Russian Ballet was established in St. Petersburg in the early 1700s.  As Jennifer Homans says in ""Apollo's Angels: A History of Ballet"" (2010), ""classical ballet had always been a state-supported art whose purpose ... had been ... to promote and glorify kings and tsars."" The Bolshevik Revolution's success, however, demanded that all things imperial be banished, and so the Imperial Russian Ballet required a new name. It was known as the Soviet Ballet; then, in the 1930s under Stalin, the Kirov. (In similar fashion, St. Petersburg was renamed Leningrad.)

With the instincts of a shark, Stalin recognized it was more valuable that art be tamed, not banned -- as Plato wished in ""The Republic"" -- and used as a tool by the state to keep the masses contented. Artists were, as Stalin termed it, ""engineers of the human soul."" And those whose engineering went off course put targets on their backs. The terror Stalin brought down on composers such as Shostakovich for daring to compose music that thumbed its nose at the Party line and encouraged individual thought is widely documented in volumes devoted to that subject alone.

Less well known in the Western world, perhaps, is Stalin's use of film and stage as propaganda. The Great Leader's manipulation of entertainment consumed by the public, and his puppet-mastery of those who produced it, make other propaganda machines of the time look like crude child's play. During the long nights of the Stalin era, a multitude of movies extolled the triumph of the good workers' state over the evil forces of individuality and ""formalism."" Any and all plot conflict was resolved with an enforced happy ending in which fairy tales became real.

Because the public art form of ballet was the genre in which Russia dominated -- ""the de facto official art of the Soviet state,"" as Homans says -- it came under special scrutiny and manipulation by Stalin and his henchmen. Therefore, a revised ""happy"" ending for Swan Lake became the new normal, presented in an idealistic glow in which reality turns into a fairy tale.

This revisionist libretto of Swan Lake also required that the evil bird of prey Rothbart be defeated, thus unfortunately creating the inappropriately laughable ""feather flop,"" as shown in the Kirov film. With one wing ripped off in his fight with Siegfried, Rothbart expires writhing on the stage like a fish on land gulping for air. In addition, we are plagued in this version of Swan Lake with the annoying jester slipped in by Alexander Gorsky in a 1901 Bolshoi production, supposedly to enliven some of the routine action. More's the pity.

The Soviets' use of ballet for propaganda didn't cease with Stalin's death in 1953. When Khrushchev came to the United States in 1959, it was ballet with which he mocked the U.S. as inferior because it had nothing to match the excellence of state-supported ballet in the Soviet Union. Ballet, Khrushchev declared, ""is our pride."" This Kirov film of Swan Lake shows why.",1409270400,7,4521,4.959048877146631

Siegfrieds black tights in act two made his leg movements difficult to see, there should have been a lighter background or perhaps the camera angle was at fault. I detest the awkward ugly unlovely stretched out hopping on one foot in scene two. Aren't there other steps that would work better? Lighting in act one scene two and act three was just ""that"" much too dark. The audio was only two channel stereo; in this day of five and seven channel surround! No extras. What's up Kultur?

  Likes: The large stage allowed the dancers room to maneuver. The costumes were not overdone nor were there any obtrusive stage sets.(Royal's 2009 version comes to mind).  Lighting other than those noted was fairly uniform. Some costumes in act two were colorful. Still, monotone ruled. Rothbart consigned to the edges of the stage and not interfering with Siegfried and Odile allowed Odile much more stage time. During one effort she goes from light hearted to full leaps when the music swells.(excellent). Overall I believe, the dancing was much more graceful than some other versions. Even the hated hopping on one foot.

  Third act: instead of a simulated battle between Siegfried and Rothbart, all three dance until Rothbart(lit with a red baby spot) concedes and fades off stage. Much more pleasant to watch. One thing missing was the more dramatic pleading of Siegfried and final forgiveness by Odette found in other version. Overall, I liked this better than some other versions due to the more graceful dancing and the third act ending.

 May 3. Watched again today and while still impressed with the dancing, I was even less impressed by the lighting which is too dark. Adjusting the monitor brightness upward ten points helps tremendously.",1335398400,2,2253,4.820779220779221

This version of Swan Lake has absolutely beautiful staging and production values, wonderful photography, lighting and sound, beautiful costumes and fine choreography. It has some narration in it for those not familiar with the story, which was very nice.  The only thing I wished it had was an audience.  The recording seems like a recording of a dress rehearsal, not a performance, and it's amazing how much one misses that.  It has a dead quality.  I don't mean to say that the dancers and everyone else didn't appear to be giving their all, because I believe they did, but one did miss an audience to energize their performance. Yulia Makhalina is a very beautiful woman and a wonderful dancer, no question about it, and makes a very pleasing Odette/Odille. Igor Zelensky dances wonderfully and I appreciated his strength and fluidity but definitely no chemistry between he and Yulia.  That killed it a little bit but still, it's a very fine performance.

It is an intelligent and artistic combination of the Tschaikowski's Swan Lake with (let's say) the Bolshoi Ballet, the Circus of Moscow and the Canadian Cirque du Soleil (acrobatic circus). And all this magnificent arrangement having as background the traditional Chinese culture.

It is impossible to describe in words the ballet spectacle produced by the Chinese, mainly the very difficult accrobatic show presented by the artists.

The swan, the artist Wu Zhengdam, won the toppest prize in Russia. The director is Zhao Ming, and the prince is Wei Baohua.

219219,5,6300175170,"Historic performances must be evaluated utilizing entirely different criteria from those applied to contemporary works. To judge a recorded performance from the past using modern audio-visual standards is to entirely miss the point of historic art preservation. Even precious snippets of performances, however poor the quality, enable us to time travel back to an earlier era in which artistic practices were markedly different from today's. These differences, however, in no way diminish the gifts and genius of earlier talents.

These older and sometimes extremely rare artifacts are a spectacular opportunity for those of us who appreciate having these otherwise lost cultural treasures salvaged and preserved.

In this case, we have the legendary Maya Plisetskaya - youthful, beautiful, and phenomenally flexible, charismatic and dramatic, in the quintessentially Russian Swan Lake.

The sound and picture quality are by no means inadequate. It is a stunning experience just to be able to see Plisetskaya in her milieu at the Bolshoi, creating two completely different characters - one vulnerable, magical, the other seductively evil and predatory. Her gracefulness, her almost supernatural ability to incarnate the soul of a bird, make the cuts and audience shots irrelevent.

In fact, for those who truly appreciate history - cultural and political as well as artistic - this video is priceless. We see the Soviets at their propagandistic best. It's as if we're seeing two videos - one an historic ballet performance starring one of the 20th century's immortal artists, the other an adroitly executed and subtle propaganda film - in which the well-groomed, appreciative audience from all classes in this classless society is as much a part of the performance as the dance.

Besides Plisetskaya, the other stars of this film are the audience and the stage crew: beautiful young intellectuals mingle with sturdy loyal Party members. The less elegant but apparently no less artistically informed workers, both in the audience and behind the curtain, seem to appreciate ballet as much as the intelligentsia in the boxes. We even see Maya, behind the scenes, relieved and gratified to receive the loving approval of the woman who helps her change her costume. After all, in this vast social experiment, all comrades are equal....

The conducting of the Bolshoi orchestra is excellent. The conducting often makes a huge difference in ballet, although it's not often commented on.  Historic ballet performances can have faster, more propulsive, rhythmic conducting, while contemporary ballet orchestras can be so slow and agonizingly boring.

The dancing is in this Swan Lake is consistently superb. The jester has the outstanding athleticism and power we associate with the Russian school. The Rothbart plays out his death scene with such dramatic potency that the audience explodes with spontaneous applause.

Yes, there are cuts; yes the film quality is not Hollywood. But to have the opportunity to view Plisetskaya at the Bolshoi, in her radiant youth, and in the stellar role of her career is priceless. I highly recommend her autobiography ""I, Maya Plisetskaya"" which, with candor and passion tells the story of the grinding struggles that even artists at the highest levels were forced to survive in the Soviet Union.",1226448000,49,3324,5.352490421455939
219220,5,6300175170,"This is one of my favorite Swan Lakes. Yulia Makhalina is one of the most beautiful ballerinas I have ever seen. She is also as technically accomplished as any ballerina I've seen. Now, I do not know anything at all about the techniques of ballet, but I do know beauty when I see it.

The theater had no audience and there was no sign of a live orchestra, although it had very good stereo sound. I doubt if it was a live orchestra because there was no sound of ballet shoes on the stage. Costuming and sets were spectacular. As usual for a Russian performance of Swan Lake it has the so called happy ending, but the Russians should wake up to the fact that the sad ending is better, which is how Petipa and Tchaikovsky designed it to end. The emotion is there in the music for the sacrificial ending, and after all that is a happy ending, for how could there be a more romantic ending than a love living forever in paradise?

Typical of Russian ballets, there is very little if any mime used in this production. I like to see mime used in ballet. I believe it was the Russians who invented it, yet now they use it the least. It is a beautiful art form in itself. The arm and hand motions go very well with all the movements of dance. See the American Ballet Theatre for excellent examples of mime in Swan Lake.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tchaikovsky-Swan-Lake-American-Ballet-Theatre-Murphy-Corella/dp/B000AYEI9A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tchaikovsky - Swan Lake / American Ballet Theatre, Murphy, Corella</a>&nbsp;It was the ABT who showed in mime that the lake the swans inhabit was formed by their tears.

219222,4,6300175170,"A glorious 'Swan Lake'.

This is a movie version of Tchaikovsky's 'Swan Lake' filmed in 1990. The performance is done by the Kirov Ballet and stars Yulia Makhalina and Igor Zelensky.

There are many positives regarding this DVD and only one minor negative...let me explain.

The good:

1.)This is one of the most beautiful renditions of this ballet I've ever been privileged to witness. Makhalina is a vision of loveliness and her skills, designating her as a prima ballerina are not hard to spot. Her spins and balance are flawless and her sense of timing with her partners is perfection itself.

2.)Prince Siegfried is danced by Igor Zelensky (a dancer unknown to me prior to this performance). I felt his emotional response to his role was a little flat, BUT his spins and leaps (especially in his solo in Act II) were breath taking. The height and hang-time of his leaps were reminiscent of Baryshnikov in his prime; his leaping spins were exquisitely performed and fully completed.

3.)The costumes and sets; simply sumptuous...enough said.

4.)Camera work and position of shooting angles was, with a couple of exceptions, well done and resulted in visual pleasing presentation on this DVD.

The Negative: (singular)

Whether you like a recorded performance with or without a live audience is, of course, a personal preference. However, I felt this work sorely missed the spontaneous response that is only obtained with a live audience. Within this DVD you'll be witness to some of the most incredible skills in the form of a pas de deux or solo dance(s); but then, the music would end, the dancer(s) would hold their finishing poses and...nothing...just dead, disquieting silence. The camera then faded to black and the next scene started.

It's hard to express in the written word how much the applause and the shouted 'bravos' add to a performance such as this. To me, the lack of audience response slightly diminished the overall effect of this otherwise magnificent ballet; I really felt that the performance was incomplete...something was missing. One can only wonder how it could not have affected the dancers themselves; hard to believe they'd not have 'given' more before a live audience.

Conclusion:
One of the finest productions of 'Swan Lake' I've seen, featuring two of the world's best dancers in their prime. It's unfortunate it wasn't recorded in front of a live audience; one can only speculate about an even better performance than in this movie version.
5 Stars for the music, dancers, sets and costumes. 2 1/2 stars for the movie format.",1217289600,95,2563,4.992957746478873

I'll tell you just how common I am. I had to look up the spelling of common. Another thing is when I saw Nina's last name it looked a lot like the city I used to live in, Nashville, Tn. I thought to myself, now I  should be able to remember her name, Ananiashvili sounds a lot like Nashville.
 Well anyway, it may surprise you to know that there are some Tennessee hillbillies who really do love classical music and do not care that much for the Grand Ole Opry style of music, not withstanding the fact that country and western music put ""The Music City"" on the map.

 I've just started my collection of classical ballet and cannot claim to be an expert but I'm learning. I now know how to pronounce fouette, and I think I know what they are. It's hard to believe just how beautiful they are when done by someone as good as Nina Ananiashvili. This DVD is filmed in front of an audience and it was plain to see there were no clips in the film to suggest that she might have had time to rest before she did them, or to do it over in case it wasn't quite right. I know that sort of thing takes place, because in ""Don Quixote""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Minkus-Don-Quixote-Ananiashvili-Fadeyechev/dp/B000BZIT7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Minkus - Don Quixote / Ananiashvili, Fadeyechev</a>&nbsp;one can see that her fouettes were inserted later as there is no Don Quixote sitting in the chair behind her, as there should have been. The very next scene shows him seated in his chair with his sidekick Sancho. But no matter, she was just as beautiful in Don Quixote as she was in Swan Lake.

 When Nina is ""in character"", as when she is Odette, one can see that she is a very unhappy Swan-Maiden, and one can also see that she cannot lose that composure even when members of the audience are yelling and screaming their bravos. Except, that is, until she becomes Odile. Then there is a completely different Nina on the stage. A completely different personality. Saucy and mischievous and deliciously beautiful in her Black Swan outfit. Prince Siegfried isn't the only one who fell in love with her, I did too.

 Nina has the best balance when she is en pointe than any ballerina I have seen so far. I do not know what the pose is called (it's shown on the back cover of the keep case from Kultur). After she releases  Fadeyechev's hand she holds her balance for an eternity before slowly slowly lowering her leg without a moment of imbalance until her foot is beside the other, (yes I meant to say slowly twice). I look at that over and over again, it's so remarkable. I lose my balance just trying to put my pants on unless I lean against something. Hey, I'm 77 years old.

 Even if this was a Japanese orchestra, it sounded very good to me, and it sounded just as good (to me) as the Kirov Theatre Orchestra, when they performed for their Swan Lake production with Yulia Makhalina and Igor Zelensky.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tchaikovsky-Petipa-Swan-Lake-Kirov-Ballet-Yulia-Makhalina-Igor-Zelensky/dp/B000G1ALF2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tchaikovsky, Petipa - Swan Lake / Kirov Ballet, Yulia Makhalina, Igor Zelensky</a>&nbsp;Yulia is another gorgeous creature, by the way.

219249,3,6300175170,"I must first acknowledge up front that ""Swan Lake"" (SL) is not my favorite ballet, and of the three most famed full-length ballets set to Tchaikowsky's music, I prefer the other two, not least because the music itself in ""Nutcracker"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"" is far superior (in my opinion) to the pedestrian, repetitive score the composer did for SL. Act I is an outright bore - Baryshnikov once said that as a youngster when he was sent off to see productions of SL at the Kirov, he would sit there thinking to himself, ""Isn't it over yet?  Why isn't it over yet?  When is it going to be over?""  Out of four acts, there is really only about 45 minutes of dancing worth watching: the Act II lakeside scene, the famed Black Swan pas de deux in Act III, and a few moments in the rather short final act.  The rest is filler, and to less than inspiring music.

All that said, great dancers in the leading roles can make SL worthwhile, especially if you can push a button and skip Act I and everything in Act III until Odile arrives. . .  In this particular version, the Royal Ballet serves up its excellent corps, a mature but still technically sound Natalia Makarova in the title role, and Anthony Dowell as the feckless Prince Siegfried.  Makarova was born to dance Odette - her lyricism, beautifully articulated feet, back, and arms, and Kirov style are in perfect soulful sync with the choreography.  Although close to the end of her career here, she is still just about fully in command of her technique and shows that her fame in the role was justly earned.  I have never found hers a particularly sympathetic persona but in this performance her occasional inability to conceal her awareness of her gifts did not intrude.  She is less successful, but only slightly less so, in Act III as Odile.  Makarova was never a brilliant classicist, and the bravura dancing required of Odile is generally not her strong point.  In this dilemma she is not alone, as few ballerinas combine the extraordinary lyricism required of Odette AND the brilliant, diamond-hard classicism required of Odile.  In fact, originally, the ballet was conceived for two ballerinas, one dancing Odette and another Odile. The same ballerina doing both parts was a later development.  Nevertheless, Makarova does well in Act III, considering its choreography does not play to her strengths.  She travels practically all the way downstage during her 32 fouettes, but she gets them all done completely and, at the age of 41 and in such a taxing role, that is saying something.  Her balances (which were curiously lacking in security when I saw her years earlier in ""Sleeping Beauty"" - Aurora was definitely NOT one of her better roles) are marvelous and this is, ultimately, a very satisfying performance.

Dowell, by contrast, seems curiously bland emotionally - perhaps his natural reserve paled even further next to Makarova's Kirov emotionalism - although he executes his few solos beautifully - one forgets what beautiful, elegant, legs he had - with high jumps and clean turns.  His partnering is, as always, faultless, but, like the Prince in ""Sleeping Beauty"", this is mostly a thankless part.

The Royal Ballet's corp performs beautifully, the production is completely traditional - and one of my favorite dramatic dancers from the Royal's past, Derek Rencher, is wasted as von Rothbart (who is NOT wasted as von Rothbart?!).  You want to see Derek Rencher as a biting Tybalt in the first of these recorded, live full-length ballets from the Royal, the Czinner production of Macmillan's Romeo & Juliet, filmed in 1966, with a very mature Margot Fonteyn and a young Rudolf Nureyev - but that, as they say, is another story.",1198800000,3,3696,4.818037974683544
219250,5,6300175170,"I avoid ABT vs KIROV because it sounds too competitive.  I merely want to say why the ABT production also deserves a five-star rating.

A few months ago I bought a DVD of Swan Lake by The American Ballet Theatre even if I wasn't so sure whether Angel Corella would fit the role of Prince Siegfried; I was even less sure about Gillian Murphy because I never heard of her.  To my surprise, Angel is terrific.  He moves elegantly and his stage deportment and poses befit a prince despite his rather undersized stature.  And Gillian Murphy, the moment she appears on the scene she is the incarnation of Natalia Makarova I don't mean she is the copy of her I mean they are of the same caliber.  The ABT has excellent dancers; therefore, I need not spent time to elaborate on it.  It is a very beautiful and interesting production.

I had been suspecting that the Kirov production is the same one that I bought many years ago on layser disc format and indeed it is when I saw it yesterday afternoon a few hours after I received it from the mail,  It was issued by Sony then.  It is of course a very beautiful production and Yulia Makhalina is superb, Igor Zelensky is too.  But to say that they are better dancers and or better actors than the ABT couple, I disagree.
Let's put it this way, They have different style.  They are all very good,
they all belong to the best.

Somehow, I still wish that Ethan Stiefel was in the lead role instead. I first discovered him in the film 'Center Stage'; besides being a fantastic dancer, he is also a good actor.  I also have the ABT productions of LE CORSAIRE AND VIRTUOSITY=a mixed bill.  From all these DVDs, to me Ethan is from top to bottom a princely image.  The producer who wishes to produce the new ABT Sleeping Beauty should really cast him as the lead role. May be Paloma Herrera would make an ideal Aurora.",1184025600,20,1853,4.374269005847953

219252,5,6300175170,"I'm not an expert but was a ballerina as a little girl and graduated into toe shoes in my early teens, so I know how difficult it is to dance ballet. Makarova is simply enchanting as Odette the Swan Princess. She was in her early 40's when this was filmed in the 80's. Her classical training in the Russian ballet program is very evident here. She's not perfect, but comes pretty close. This is a very demanding role for any ballerina especially one nearing the end of a fabulous career. Her legendary reputation is certainly solidified by this magnificent performance. Her beautiful, fluid arm movements are absolutely mesmerizing. Her facial and physical expressions add to a beautiful, dramatic interpretation. I have yet to see another ballerina emote and bring forth such dramatic intensity as Odette. Dowell is a very talented dancer and quite handsome too. I enjoyed his pirouettes and he has amazing balance. I thought he was quite sensitive as Prince Siegfried. They seemed to have very good chemistry. The Swan maidens were wonderful, but lacking the exact precision of the Paris Ballet or Kirov corps. Film was beautifully shot and has held up well considering the age of the original master tape. Overall, this is still my favorite Swan Lake performance on dvd simply for Makarova & Dowell's performances. At the curtain call, it was charming to see Makarova kiss a single red rose from her bouquet and present it to Dowell for a job well done.",1177113600,11,1456,4.85140562248996
219253,5,6300175170,"I do not know much about ballet and started enjoying recently. I saw Swan Lake by ABT and NYBT live but this was the best. I enjoyed it so much and watched it over and over thanks to Yulia Makhalina's excellent performance.

Although I enjoyed ABT and NYBT's performance, it was the first time that I felt like watching a real Swan in this Kirov's Swan Lake and could feel sadness and beauty of Odette. Makhalina performs Odette so beautifully and sadly and performs Odile so sexy and confidently at the same time. For odile part, I liked how she expresses in her eye before doing spins. I loved how Odette appears and dances in the lake for the first time. I also liked the part where Siegfried looks for Odette to ask for forgiveness. I don't know why nobody mentioned about this Swan Lake DVD. Please try it!!! You will really enjoy it.",1170115200,40,839,4.4480519480519485

To me,she is currently the most accomplished classical ballet dancer.( hopefully she does not retire soon ).She has solid foot-works and always dances with great confidence. Her upper torso is so soft and expressive. This performance is of no difference.

The only criticism I have is that the recording/video quality is not the best I've seen. It's ashamed that none of her performances of full length ballet at the ABT was recorded. That would have left us with important documents of what great classical ballet dancing should be.

Brava Nina.",1152057600,3,621,5.019417475728155

Fadeyetchev as the Prince, although not dancing with the emotional intensity of a Malakhov or Nureyev, nevertheless presents his ballerina almost with his own self-effacement. He knows what he's there for, and it's not to show off himself. And, at the least, he is beautiful to look at. The corps is well rehearsed, and again, defers to Ms. Ananiashvili, who doesn't simply dance the Swan Queen, but becomes her so truly that one cannot help but suspend disbelief.",1145404800,14,695,5.105263157894737
219256,5,6300175170,"I bought this dvd to see the principals perform one of my favorite ballets and I was not disappointed, much. Both Ananiashvili and Fadeyetchev give wonderful and accurate performances.  This version is pretty much a traditional one, with most of Petipa's ideas.  I was a little disappointed that there was not much very new, exciting, and technically challenging, as one should expect at this point in ballet history.  The prince does not dance much in the first act, but they have given him a new solo adagio, which was refreshing.  Another refreshment is the fourth act which uses some music that is often cut out.  All the acts are a nice full length.  Aside for the sedate principal dancer's choreography, everything else is well done:  the costumes, sets, group choreography, and the character dancing.  Maybe this would not be my first choice in traditional Swan Lakes, but if you have a collection, as I do, this should find a place in it.",1140307200,7,946,4.796296296296297

The rest of the company-- and I dare say the orchestra (it's Japanese)-- is not world class but good enough, but it is the prima ballerina ""natural""  who rates five stars.  (Rothbart actually bops Odette on the noodle accidentally with his hand in Act 3.)  Particularly noteworthy are Ananiashvili's beautiful long arms, which undulate like fronds in subtle undersea currents.  She understands her characters, stays in character, and is charismatic.  See also her vivacious performance in Don Quixote.",1137456000,11,621,5.285714285714286
219287,3,6300175170,"Ms. Ananiashvili was very good, but her partner Fadeyetchev was very, very mediocre. I wonder why he was chosen as a lead performer. I'm sure he loves to dance, but he should not be a premiere in any ballet.

Although, i like Ms. Anaisshvili very much, I did not enjoy the production. The worst thing though was the last scene at the lake. The music was not the same music from Tschiakovsky's score that is usually played for that scene of the ballet. It did not fit at all!!!

If you have not seen Swan Lake, especially the German ballet version with Steffi Scherzer, then perhaps you will enjoy it. I have seen so many versions of this one-derful ballet, but this was the worst. It's not bad, but it's not good either.",1136419200,18,720,4.406015037593985
219288,5,6300175170,"I have watched many live and video performances of this ballet and this is the one version I find myself returning to time and time again.  There is something so dramatically compelling about the way Makarova and Dowell interpret their roles that my attention is held in a way that perhaps more technically proficient renderings of the roles could not.  Makarova and Dowell in the leads are ultimately the most satisfying interpretations I have yet witnessed.

Makarova's dancing is a wonder to behold; her magisterial, liquid adagio dancing in the Act II grand pas deux was of course, a given.  Makarova's dancing was possessed of a unique physicality, a way of moving that made it seem as though her arms and legs were radiating a plush and limitless stretch.  One could almost see an energy field originating from the centre of her body and pulsing out through her arms and legs and emanating far beyond her head, hands and feet.  There seemed to be a mysterious and boundless stretch to Makarova.  Baryshnikov too, had this ""mysterious stretch"" in his dancing.  And Makarova's hands,  what magical and bewitching worlds can be conjured  from a pair expressive arms and hands!  Watch, at the coda of Act II when Makarova's Odette runs towards Dowell's Siegfried, and is caught in his arms and lifted high above his head.  With a ripple of her arms, the well-timed arch of her back, neck and head, one could almost believe Odette would take flight right  then.  The moment is breathtaking and for that moment, time might as well have stopped.

What has continued to surprise me is Makarova's Odile. In this act Makarova, physically, becomes a whole other creature.  The same lambent grace is still there, the same palpable and mysterious stretch, but now her edges have sharpened and her dancing has taken on a hard, cold, obdurate quality.  I will never forget her baleful expression when she first turns towards Prince Siegfried to present her hand for the very first time.  This moment marks the beginning of the Act III ""Black Swan"" grand pas de deux, and what a spellbinding moment it is.  The whole ballroom now shines with a hectic glitter and now begins the ultimate dance of deception.

Unshakable bravura was never a hallmark of Makarova's dancing and I could quibble about her indifferent fouettes.  I prefer instead to revel in the splendour of her dramatic interpretation.  From start to finish, Makarova's Odile is a textbook example of how to enchant a Prince and an audience into believing completely, an evil magician's deception.  Even as Makarova negotiates Odile's treacherous choreography, her conviction and her hold on her dramatic portrayal is so unwavering that by the end, the Prince is utterly destroyed.  Makarova's Odile is so convincing that at the end of the pas de deux, the audience finds itself on its feet applauding not a ballerina, but for the total triumph of von Rothbart's diabolical creation.  As an aside, Makarova's pique/chaine turns at the end of her solo are so fleet and so delicious that I never again want to see another dancer stumping her way through this same variation.

I make special mention of Sir Fredrick Ashton's choreography in Act IV.  There's a particularly lovely and effective sequence where in small groups, Odette ushers away her swan sisters and returns to a kneeling Siegfried, bends down slowly and deeply into an arabesque penche and bestows her forgiveness for Siegfried's unwitting betrayal.  Almost no one does this ""forgiveness and reconciliation"" scene anymore.

The overall production values of the Royal Ballet's ""Swan Lake"" are somewhat inconsistent, the stage sets and costumes look like they were taken out of cold storage and the dancing of the corps de ballet could benefit from a more pliant use of the back and arms.

Natalia Makarova and Anthony Dowell's dancing are of a kind that informs an age.  I search in vain for a young Makarova or a young Baryshnikov that would bring the same magic and transcendent artistry from which their legends were made.",1131840000,111,4040,4.931952662721893
219289,4,6300175170,"This is an outstanding performance by the Royal Ballet.  The Royal Ballet is one of my absolute favorite ballet combanies.  Makarova is phenominal.  Her Odette is so dramatic and is filled with passion.  On the other hand, her Odile is creepy.  A perfect Odile in my opinion: wicked and bewitching.

I especially loved Makarova's facial expressions during the Adagio in act one.  They were so dramatic and filled with passion.  It was as if Makarova dedicated herself to her role.  Like Fonteyn, she can act as well as dance.  I recommend this ballet to anyone who loves ballet and romance.  It's a great ballet.",1122854400,8,612,4.788461538461538

219292,3,6300175170,"Is Odette a swan or a princess? I suppose that this has been a longstanding question for many balerinas. For my part I am inclined to think that she is first of all a princess! However Miss makarova portayed Odette as a BIRD throughout her career and won considerable acclaim for it. I must admit that no one since has been able to do this more convincingly. The first time I watched this video was 19 years ago. I was 17 years old and was mesmerised by her performance. Since than I have watched this video again along with other productions of the ballet and can not help thinking that this venerable ballerina uses way too many arm movements and that many of them are superfluous and uneccessary. I now think that this is bad taste if anything!
Miss Makarova is a great ballerina but she lacks elegance in her manner. This she covers up with her beautiful lines and delicate form. She is more suited for roles such as Don Quichotte and Romeo and Juliette where more dramatic expressivness is needed rather than regal restraint and otherworldly airiness.
Her portrail of Odile however is unparalled! She is bewitching.
The rest of the production is outdated and the renditions made by Ashton are not worth mentionning.
Inspite my criticism of miss Makarova's performance she is the only reason to buy this dvd IF, that is, you must have it!",1088640000,7,1342,4.619246861924686

219295,3,6300175170,"Makarova was, obviously arguably.... given some of the reviews below, the Odette/Odile of her generation. I have not seen a ""better"" one since. Therefore, this DVD is a must: it's the only visual record we have of her performance. And, notwithstanding criticisms by other reviewers below, I think her performance is a pretty eloquent one, in technique and style. I have seen her quite a few times in the role, and though this is a bit short of the magic I know she could generate, it is fairly representative. I consider myself lucky to have it.
Now, as to the rest and why I think, in general, this performance is disappointing. Dowell was a very fine dancer: crisp, clean lines, elegant and satisfactory virtuosity, all in evidence here, as is his natural reticence which is out of place in this piece....... There is no chemistry between him and Makarova. He might as well have been reading the phonebook as he danced. In some ways he struck me as the all-purpose, highly skilled partner doing his job for the visiting ballerina of the evening. Makarova had great partners in this role throughout her career, most notably Ivan Nagy. Together they could make the second act pas-de-deux a truly moving experience. It's a pity such wasn't the case here.
Another drawback to this performance was the Royal Ballet itself. I think it was in a rather fallow period at the time. The swans sleepwalk through their part and are off-and-on sloppy. The various dances in the third act are a bore, the Spanish Dance is particularly ludicrous. Though Wayne Sleep does a very good job in the Italian number, everybody else in all the other dances reek of mediocrity, particularly the women. There's no virtuosity, no command of line or technique.... Where's the zest? It didn't help that the conducting was somewhat feeble.
In short...... if you are interested in having a record of Makarova's Odette/Odile, get it.....It's a pity she wasn't helped by the framework she was given but c'est la vie. With that very restricted goal in mind, you will not be disappointed. If you are interested in Swan Lake proper and plan in having only one version, stick with the Kirov.
