2168089,3,B00064VQXK,"I realize I will only be repeating what Kim wrote but it bears repeating . . . I started collecting these before Nick was kind enough to release SBSP by Season so I am sticking with these compilation DVDs.  Sadly, Nick has started to repeat themselves and has thrown ""Ripped Pants"" onto this release, which is also on Nautical Nonsense.  Quite disappointing.  I hope it's a mistake and not the beginning of a pattern.",1104969600,6,417,4.608108108108108
2168090,3,B00064VQXK,"Yet another single-disc collection in the endless Spongebob DVD library. At my standpoint, collecting the season sets is much easier (Seasons 1 and 2 are available now, if you're interested), but if you've been collecting these discs prior to the season sets, then it's best to stick with these. Now we have ""Home Sweet Pineapple,"" a collection of 8 episodes. But, surprise surprise, Nick has started to repeat themselves. They've put on the disc ""Ripped Pants,"" which is already in the Sponge Buddies/Nautical Nonsense DVD, and ""Band Geeks"" which is on the Halloween DVD. Quite odd to put on the DVD two episodes that they've already released. So that's 6 episodes fresh to DVD, and with two more of these scheduled to release in 2005, we may be in for more repetition.

BUT, if you're buying this out of the blue just to watch a little Spongebob, then these are some fine episodes, my friend.",1104537600,9,894,4.767741935483871
2168091,1,B00064VQXK,"I must completely agree with ""Ripped Pants ? RIPPED OFF !!"" review. I own every piece of animation ever released by ol' spongie including the out of sequence $15.00 money makers Snick released one by one & this will be the 1st time I save the $15 bucks towards a nice dinner out with my wife. This is such a blatant excuse to try & make a buck that I don't even care if my collection is one DVD short because of it. As for ""Help Wanted"" [the pilot, and one of the best episodes ever]; I was told by ""someone"", & who knows how reliable this is, that they couldn't secure the rights to the Tiny Tim song ""Having A Wonderful Time"" for the DVD release. Whatever the reason, that 1st season is incomplete without this episode as far as I'm concerned. Looks like I'm now (im)patiently waiting for season 3. Hope it was worth it Tricky Slicky Nicky. I'm out",1110931200,2,850,4.253086419753086
2168092,1,B00064VQXK,"Nick - you thieving @#&^*%'s !  Why are you doing this to your most loyal fans ?  First you snare us into buying single dvd's with the episode orders all mixed up.  Then you bring out the full season sets (although how season one can be ""full"" without the pilot episode ""Help Wanted"" I don't know).  Having invested more than $100 in the single dvd's, we keep on buying those.  Now you bring out a new single dvd, but with 2 repeat episodes on it !  That's 6 ""new"" episodes for my $15.  With only a few unreleased episodes remaining, how many more repeats are there going to be ?  How much more money can Nick wring out of its loyal fanbase ?  I don't know .... I love the Sponge dude, but I'm sick of being ripped off.  Now that Spongie is nearing the end of his premium marketable life, it seems that Nick are trying to get as much money out of him as possible before the kids finally turn their backs on him.  I haven't taken the shrink-wrap off of this dvd yet, so I;m taking it straight back to the store.  Sure there are 8 great episodes on here, but come on - there used to be 10 on each dvd and no repeats.  I am so disappointed.",1108771200,12,1137,4.0675675675675675
2168093,2,B00064VQXK,"I agree with the other reviewers - This is no way to reward the loyal fans who have collected every DVD released so far - repeating episodes that are on previous DVD's!  And the special features are lame.  Lets have more of the behide the scenes of the voice actors.  Poor quality product here, Nickelodeon.",1107907200,2,307,4.545454545454546

2168095,1,B00064VQXK,"For the past couple of years I have always looked forward to getting new spongebob dvds. The periodic release every other couple of months was so very perfect to satiate my desire for the sponge.  This time has obviously come to a temporary end, and it is safe to say I terribly disagree with this release.  I would like to be able to buy ""NEW"" (unreleased and outside of the complete seasons) episodes in this manner.  This is one fan's point of view.",1105747200,2,452,4.421686746987952

8038586,1,B00064VQXK,"Dear SpongeBob Fan ""xaxexixoxux"".  Why don't you read the reviews properly, you berk?  The complaint isn't that we've seen 2 of the episodes before.  It's that 2 of the episodes are already on other single SB dvd's that Nickelodeon have released.  If you can't be bothered to read reviews properly before you criticeze them, why don't you keep your stupid fat mouth shut.  Honestly, you PRAT !!!!!",1128988800,,397,4.865671641791045
8038587,4,B00064VQXK,"I am not actually reviewing this yet (thus I only rated it 4 stars), because technically I haven't even got it yet, even though I've seen around half the eps on it, but I am here to make a complaint.
Just because you have probably seen 2 of the episodes before on DVD, doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it! What about those who have seen them before on DVD and enjoy it anyway? And what about those newer ones? I really expected better of you people.
Let me just clue you in on the ones I have seen.

Home Sweet Pineapple (I saw this one on the SpongeBob Marathon on Nick during half term).
Poor SpongeBob. A swarm of nemotodes have sucked all the juice out of his pineapple home, leaving only a pebble behind. What's a homeless guy and his snail to do? Whilst he thinks he can move back in with his parents (naturally, this is a big celebration to Squidward), Patrick believes there are other options. Like building a new house. Or becoming his rock mate. But both are easier said than done... I've only seen it once, so I can't make too big a leap when it comes to ratings. But since it has 2 big Squidward scenes, of which I am a huge fan (Squid, I mean), I must rate it... - 9 outta 10.

Band Geeks.
Let's face it, Squidward's kinda always had a dream to be a world famous musician. So he isn't likely to pass up a chance to perform, at the Bubble Bowl, with his arch rival from high school and band class Squilliam Fancyson watching, in a hurry. The problem? He doesn't have a band. So he recruits everyone in Bikini Bottom at short notice. Will the band flop and crush Squidward's one chance of happiness into little tiny bite-size pieces, or will it be a sweet sweet victory? Genius. Pure genius. Addicted from first watch. - 20 outta 10 (I tried to make the rating meter bigger, it was that good!)

Ripped Pants.
SpongeBob's always been a little jealous of Sandy hanging out with Larry sometimes. But when he gets the chance to impress both at the weight lifting section in Goo Lagoon (by lifting 2 marshmallows on a stick), he's humiliated when he accidentally rips his swim pants!! That is, until he finds out they're laughing with him, not at him. So if lifting weights gets a big laugh, then frisbee in face must kill, and surfing must knock them dead. But what about pretending to drown? It's got a song, which is always a good thing. - 9 outta 10.

Culture Shock.
You know Squidward. Stuffy, boring... well, that's how the public see him. But inside he's a squid with dreams at hitting the big time. So when Mr Krabs needs a gimmick to get customers back (the place has been deserted for a while), naturally Squidward gets the idea for a talent show; the chance for him to bring some culture ""to this cultureless wasteland we call Bikini Bottom; not to mention the money..."" But finding talent and keeping it isn't as easy as it looks, especially as over confident Squidward wants the whole thing to be about himself and his interpretive dancing. Unfortunately, the public don't feel the same way. Can Squid pull something out of the hat (or, um, tentacles), or is it all down to a star struck sponge with square pants and a mop with no underwear at all? I think this episode is the first episode in Series 1 (so really, like, ever) to show Squidward's passion for the arts. But I feel maybe Squidward suffered too much in this ep. Can't they take it easy on him for just 1 ep? - 9 outta 10.

So there you go. If you haven't seen them before, get it. If you have, well, get it anyway, and celebrate the quality of these eps. However, that's more than I can say, for I haven't even seen it. But when I do get it, I will edit my review and clue you in on the rest of the episodes. Until then...
Oh, and Lord Vader ""Anakin Skywalker""? First, it's jerk, not berk. If you wanna be a creep, do it properly. And second, when I say you've seen 2 of the episodes before, I meant on DVD. I have made the necessary corrections. So shut your mouth, you mediocre clarinet player.",1127001600,3,3977,4.318607764390897
