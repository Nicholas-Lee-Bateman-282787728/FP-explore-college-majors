2989222,5,B000WPJT1Y,"I was a kid with our first TV when I became a fan of The Range Rider.  Jock Mahoney (Sally Fields stepdad) is the perfect 50's cowboy.  He can ride and shoot and save the town and all in less than 30 minutes.  He and his trusty companion Dick West never swear or drink or break the law, its just like I remembered and I'm loving it.  Whoever put these together on DVD did a great job.  If you remember this show as fondly as I do I know you will enjoy it.",1248480000,20,455,3.849462365591398
2989223,5,B000WPJT1Y,"It took me a long time to decide to buy this offering of the Range Rider from Alpha Video. I have not had a lot of luck with past purchases. The transfers of some of the classic cowboy movies have been less than satisfying. But, in this case, my hat is off to Alpha. The prints are great. They look better than they did when I watched the Range Rider faithfully, through a snow-laden, vertically and horizontally challenged, nightmareish round hole we called a television.

Jack, Jock Mahony was more athletic and more at home in the saddle than any of the cowboy stars of that era. His sidekick, Dick Jones, equaled Mahony's prowess and added the comic relief, as well. I don't think I can count on one hand the number of times they used the left stirrup to mount their horses, Rawhide and Lucky. Back mounts, standing mounts, running mounts were the norm.

I never realized what a strong sense of morality and personal responsibility to do the right thing was woven into every story. When you're a kid it's the fighting, shooting and riding that count - and there's a lot of action in these episodes.

Here's hoping Alpha Video might make available the rest of the Range Rider series.

It's good to see my heroes ride again.",1239667200,37,1226,4.53393665158371
2989224,5,B000WPJT1Y,"The Range Rider was a western series in half hour format, during the years of 1951 - 1953.  There where 79 episodes, and you get 20 of them in this five DVD pack. I wish I had all of them.  The picture and the sound is very  good.  The Range Rider's character is played by Jock Mahoney, and his side kick, Dick West, is played by Dick Jones.  Both are excellent horsemen.  The show was taped on Gene Autry's ranch.  I highly recommend this DVD set.",1201737600,35,448,4.1395348837209305

2989228,2,B000WPJT1Y,"I was very disappointed in this 1-5 series because it was too much comedy interjected by side kick Dickie Jones who is not IMO humorous. I like action westerns with maybe SOME humor i.e. The Cisco Kid but I was sick of this purchase by the time I reached #4 out of 5.  Be prepared it is not your typical action shoot em up western, the comedy is not to my liking.",1398384000,,363,4.041666666666667

2989235,5,B000WPJT1Y,The reason I chose this 5 star rating is because I feel it should have one Pretty self explanatory. What did I like is that it is the original old Range rider from many years ago. What I didn't like is that back then the acting wasn't near as good as today. I still enjoyed it. I would recommend it to anyone old enough to appreciate this show.,1375920000,3,344,4.073529411764706

2989240,5,B000WPJT1Y,I love this show.  i have all these sets and a few others.  I am a big Jock Mahoney fan.  I love all the stunts in these shows.  It is obovious that he and Dick Jones do all of their own stunts.  I was very suprised to learn that Jock's daughter  in real life is Sally Fields  aka The Flying Nun.,1327190400,,296,3.7540983606557377
2989241,5,B000WPJT1Y,Nostalgic Range Rider DVD set was a GREAT gift.  Always fun to watch the old shows.  Shipped quickly.  Thank You.,1323561600,,113,4.55
2989242,5,B000WPJT1Y,I have enjoyed rewatching these westerns from my youth. Jock Mahoney was always a favorite action star with his natural grace and athleticism.,1312848000,,142,5.217391304347826
2989243,5,B000WPJT1Y,"I found these dvds to be in excellant condition. The movies are very easy to watch, no grainy transfers. The sound is also very good. If you like the range rider programs these dvds are a very good choice. Great viewing!",1311552000,6,220,4.390243902439025
2989244,5,B000WPJT1Y,"The Range Rider was a great show back in the day and it's still extremely entertaining today. After recently watching some of these episodes I have become a big fan. Why? Well Jack, (the range rider) is a true hero but the show sometimes gives us signs his weaknesses and human frailities. He's not perfect but he tries. He's got a great sense of humor and he's easy to like. Whats really cool is how athletic he was. Many times the camera shows the Range Rider jumping to roof tops and leaping fences without cutaways. These antics will earn your respect real quick!
There is a sense of real life at it's best that appeals to the viewer as the duo of Jack and Dick root out bad guys in a manner that seems it really could have happened.

Some may draw a similarity of the almost father/sun relationship Jack has with Dick on the show with Batman, but remember, this came out several years before Batman was even started.

If you like action heroics and good feeling endings, give Range Rider a try.",1287792000,12,999,4.423913043478261

8225122,5,B000WPJT1Y,The DVD's arrived quickly and the show itself is great.  I like anything that Jock Mahoney does and nobody equals his ability to do stunts.  You don't realize how the camera cuts away for just a second before action shots in other Westerns until you watch Jock in action and see that the camera never stops during his action scenes.  I love to watch him mount a horse - he does it so effortlessly!,1490140800,2,397,4.337837837837838

8225128,5,B000WPJT1Y,"""Home on the Range"" is a funny theme song for this since every episode opens with someone being chased by the bad guys with lots of shooting.
I understand they filmed this series on Gene Autry's ranch.
Range Rider  and his sidekick did all their own riding, fighting, and stunts.
Range Rider's sidekick is small like Batman's sidekick. He doesn't always do so well in fighting against the big guys, but he doesn't back down.
I have been watching this series and can't get enough of The Range Rider.
I think it's interesting that the Range Rider has no name just like the Lone Ranger. Even his sidekick calls him Rider.
Very entertaining. Wish there were more episodes.",1430265600,,668,4.661016949152542
