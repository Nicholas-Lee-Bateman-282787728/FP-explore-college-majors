8604363,4,B00EDVVMVI,"I have not seen this version but did recently see the  1960's Leslie Caron/Maurice Chevalier/ Charles Boyer version, called, Fanny.  It really moved me as well as entertained and delighted me.  I would like to see this French version (Marius & Fanny) but will need English subtitles which I don't see featured here on this BluRay.  I might just try it anyway and struggle through the french only language version.  I would love to hear reviews on this before deciding to spend the money.",1409011200,,487,4.75
8604364,3,B00EDVVMVI,"So, the French also do re-makes of perfect films of the past.  This is a pretty good version of the first 2 parts of the original trilogy, filmed in the 1930s.  However, it simply doesn't have the same spirit and salty texture.  The actors are quite good, there is just something lacking.

The story is one of young love.  Marius is a nervous young man, wanting to wander for a time and angling to join a merchant marine ship to see Asia.  A school classmate and friend, Fanny loves him and makes her feelings known.  They fall into each others' arms, in true love (I am a sucker for this, I admit), only for it not to work out for a variety of reasons.  I don't want to reveal what ultimately happens, but it is unexpected.

Recommended, but the original really is better.",1402012800,,773,4.34965034965035
