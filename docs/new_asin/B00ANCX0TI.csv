8554580,4,B00ANCX0TI,"This Firing Line Debate was not what I hoped it would be. First, WFB Jr takes almost a backseat in the discussions. The apporach to the debates in the '90s is to have 4 versus 4 with equal time to debate and represent their cases. Very balanced, very democratic. Because there are 4 on 4, each person has less time to talk and thoroughly get into discussion about topics. As a result, people are speaking hurriedly and often punctuate their points by giving minispeeches either while answering and sometimes while questioning their opponents. Because the opposition has less time to address what's being said, they find themselves forced to interrupt. Instead of a strong civil discussion, you have something which is much more contemporary (and undesirable to many) which is a lot of loud crosstalking instead of listening and responding. This is a universal criticism of this debate format for all of the debates I've seen from this period.

The debate over this issue is more academic than anything else. I remember Obama, while campaigning in '08 said he would draw back NAFTA but days later, when a Canadian official questioned the campaign about this, someone involved in the campaign assured him that the Obama administration would never do such a thing, and they haven't , and they won't, nor will any other president. The point is, while some do oppose the notion of free trade today, it will never be what it was during the period of this debate which took place in September 1992. At the time of this debate both leading candidates (Clinton ad Bush) were campaigning for more free trade.

Again, like the debate on the wall of separation between church and state, aspects of this debate are considerably dated. This debate took place in 1992 pre the technological inovations which led to home computers, the worldwide web ad eCommerce. Also, Japan was still riding its large technological (which was also economic) boom which started during the 1980's. This has changed because of the long term effects of the massive correction of Japan's markets in 1989. Much of this debate speaks of Japan's technological advances over the US and what should be done regarding the trade with a country which has that advantage.

This debate also predates the Chinese markets and their massive expansion on the world stage which continues to expand with the country's embracement of capitalism.

It's interesting to look back and revisit the arguments for and against NAFTA prior to its passing and going into effect on January 1. 1994. This is a worthy debate if you want to know about the history of the debate but feels obsolete with all that's changed in the last 20 years.",1365379200,,2674,4.87032967032967
