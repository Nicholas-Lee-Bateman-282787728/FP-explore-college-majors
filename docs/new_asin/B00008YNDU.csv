7988083,5,B00008YNDU,"I am thrilled that this series is now available on DVD.  I watched it several years ago on public television, and have been looking for it ever since.  The first hour presents the women living their upper middle class lives as wives of British colonial officials.  After that, everything changes, as they become prisoners of war to the Japanese.  As time goes on, the emotional bonding between the women is portrayed by superb script and acting.  Warning:  after the first two or three episodes, you will be hooked!",1152489600,4,515,4.795454545454546
