The story for Frankenstein's Monster came from a novel by Mary Shelley in the early 19th century. Stories about vampires and werewolves goes back centuries in folk legends that have no authors. One book said Frankenstein symbolized the Great Depression that plagued the nation and the world. Only by uniting could the people destroy the monster and the castle that produced it. The Ford Recession of 1974-75 was followed by ""Jaws"", the best-selling horror movie of all time. It was disguised as a pseudo-documentary. It too had its sequels until its audience dwindled. The horror movies of the 1930s to 1940s ended by 1945 when victory in war led to new interests.

""Frankenstein"" (1931) was the first adaption of the novel. The Monster is eliminated after the people attack the baron's castle. Baron Frankenstein's marriage promises happiness for the village (and another sequel).

""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935) tells how the Monster survived and how the village people tried to capture him. The body of a young woman is reanimated to provide a mate to the Monster. Can they propagate a new race of manufactured beings? Things don't go as planned. Will they survive the destruction of the tower?

""Son of Frankenstein"" (1939) tells about the new history of the Frankenstein family. The Monster is dormant and hidden away. Can he be revived? Ygor commands the Monster to kill his enemies. Where is the Monster now? Baron Frankenstein seemingly eliminates the Monster.",1505347200,,1497,5.122950819672131
