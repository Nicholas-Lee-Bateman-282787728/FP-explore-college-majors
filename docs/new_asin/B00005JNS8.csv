1546763,5,B00005JNS8,I grew up watching re-runs of this show. It was one of my favorite shows. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD.,1108944000,10,113,3.56
1546764,4,B00005JNS8,"Smart. Maxwell Smart. The dumbest spy in the world, who fights on behalf of the forces of goodness and niceness, and succeeded in making democracy vs. communism a lot more entertaining. With the comic trio of Don Adams, Barbara Feldon and Edward Platt, this hilarious spy spoof is still funny today.

Don Adams is Agent 86, Maxwell Smart, a not-so-bright spy with an endless arsenal of strange devices and odd sayings. The bumbling spy at a top-secret government agency called Control, which is responsible for keeping the free world free. Backing him up is his beautiful partner/love interest Agent 99 (Barbara Feldon) and his long-suffering Chief (Eward Platt) who puts up with Smart's constant mistakes.

Together with 99 and the Chief (and his faithful dog Fang), Max battles the forces of badness and rottenness -- namely, the anti-Control called KAOS. Among the enemies the Control agents face: the dwarfish ""Mr. Big,"" the fashion forces of evil, a likable killer robot, a Chinese mastermind called the Claw, and explosive paintings. And that's only the start...

""Missed it by that much!"" Maxwell Smart's catchphrases and goofy confidence made him the perfect antidote to the suave James Bond. Unlike Bond and similar movie spies, Max succeeds out of luck and bumbling more often than not, but he still succeeds.

The comic timing is a little awkward at the very beginning, but rapidly gets its footing. What's really funny is the endless spoofery -- Max is given all sorts of weird gadgets, including the legendary ""shoe-phone,"" and he faces off against all sorts of cartoonish villains.

The political clime of the mid 1960s is all over the series, especially in the form of KAOS. But fortunately they don't get preachy -- KAOS is merely a big evil organization, no more. Some references are dated, and this definitely debuted before the era of political correctness (there's a bizarre episode about American Indians threatening the US government, and the Claw is funny if un-PC).

Don Adams MAKES this series, with his quirky facial expressions, nasal voice and odd body language. Hard to tell how he could keep a straight face throughout many of the lines he says. Barbara Feldon is the least quirky of the cast, but does a good job as the brains behind Max, while Edward Platt is just wonderful as the long-suffering Chief, who always looks slightly frayed.

Though some of the 60s-era references are a bit dated, ""Get Smart"" is still gutsplittingly funny. You'll roll around on the floor, laughing yourself sick... and... loving it.",1102204800,147,2545,5.002364066193853

1547125,4,B00005JNS8,"Would you believe that Mel Brooks helped create a classic sitcom?  You may find that hard to believe, but it's the truth.  He's the co-creator of Get Smart, a spy spoof that is still as funny today as it was back in the 1960's.  I certainly enjoyed the first season.

The show follows Maxwell Smart (Don Adams), Agent 86 for CONTROL.  Unfortunately, he's not the smartest spy in the world, so he needs help along the way.  Usually helping him out is the beautiful Agent 99 (Barbara Feldon).  Both of them answer to The Chief (Edward Platt).  Even if Max is a bumbler, these three (and various other agents) seem to track down the agents of KAOS and save the free world.

Just what are some of their cases?  Well, it always seems that dangerous plans are being smuggled out of the country, sometimes on a ""Ship of Spies"" and sometimes in clothes.  Multiple times an agent is killed and Max must figure out what they had just learned.  There's a KAOS agent in the CONTROL spy school.  A doctor shows up with an invisibility ray.  (Oh, you know what I mean.)  And an assassin even pretends to be the Chief to get close to his target.  Along the way we've even got such clever deadly devices as a gun that turns people into manikins and a phone booth that fills with water to drown people.

This show is still a cultural landmark thanks mainly to Max's legendary shoe phone.  Of course, that's not the only strange phone Max uses.  There's the tie, the painting, and the gun phone, to name three.  Catch phrases such as ""Sorry about that, Chief,"" are also still popular today, although we don't hear Max say ""Missed it by that much"" very often here.

If you are familiar with the spoof of Mel Brooks, you pretty much know what to expect here.  Anything silly goes.  There are lots of puns and slapstick humor.  Since Max will mess just about anything up, the possibilities are endless.  It's very easy to find something to laugh at in just about every episode.

One thing Mel Brooks fans won't find here is his crude humor.  This was TV from the 60's after all, and he couldn't get away with much of what he did in his movies.  Frankly, I find that a refreshing change.  Likewise, even the violence is toned down.  Yes, there are gun shots and people die, but you rarely if ever see any blood.  Realistic?  No.  But this is a comedy, remember?  This is a clean comedy that the entire family can enjoy together.

Like with most shows, this one took a few episodes to find it's feet, so the first few aren't as funny or entertaining.  Another draw back to the show is the laugh track.  Since this show requires stunts and effects, it wasn't filmed before a live audience.  The canned laughter is a bit distracting at times, but it's a minor issues.

While the writers may have been feeling their way, the cast pretty much jumps into their roles right from the start.  While the humor gets funnier as the season progresses, the acting is always top notch.  They make the comedy seem effortless.

I mentioned the effects.  Some things are obviously dated, but for the most part things still work.  Suspend some believe, and you'll be just fine.

Season 1 of the show consisted of 30 episodes.  The pilot was filmed in back and white, but the other 29 episodes are in full color.  They are presented here in their original full frame ratio and stereo sound.  They may not be flashy by today's standards, but they are restored so the picture and sound are the pretty near perfect.

Extras?  Well, that just depends.  If you buy the seasons separately, you'll get no extras, but these four seasons on four discs.  However, if you buy the complete series, you'll get three audio commentaries and a fifth disc of behind the scenes information and promo materials.  Also, each episode gets a brief (30 seconds max) intro by star Barbara Feldon.

Even though the time period is the Cold War, the humor of Get Smart is timeless.  If you enjoy puns and slapstick, season 1 will have you in stitches.",1432339200,,3982,4.4860335195530725

1547127,5,B00005JNS8,"its brilliant and amazine, back when this kind of genre was so common, they came out with a spoof of the spy shows.  most tv shows were westerns or spy shows.

99 is a fashion statement.  the early episodes had the dry humor then they got better;  by the 5th season when they get married it got more goofy and  they didn't care as much about the storyline.  not a single profane word.",1426809600,,384,4.191780821917808

1547283,4,B00005JNS8,"A classic tv show, long overdue for it's dvd debut. The episodes look very clear and sharp. However, in a minor nitpick, if you zoom in on the picture, you can tell that the picture is noticeably jagged and interlaced. I'm not sure if this was originally shot on film or video but while this is not something anybody would notice on a regular viewing, when you boast ""Digitally Restored and Remastered"" on the box cover, you really should end up with better quality than simply ""as good as it looked on tv.""

My biggest complaint with the set is that you don't get any extras (other than Barbera Feldon's voiceover intro to each episode) when you purchase each season of Get Smart separately. You have to buy the big expensive box set of all 5 seasons to get the fifth disc for each season that has the extras. This seems like a shady way to try to get people to buy the whole show when they may have only liked some of the earlier episodes. And since the disc of extra features were already made, it's not like it should have cost much more at all to put them in the individual season dvd sets.",1395705600,3,1095,4.315533980582524
1547284,5,B00005JNS8,"Would you believe the 2nd greatest? How about an honorary Eagle Scout? Yes, it's Maxwell Smart, a.k.a. Agent 86, employee of the secret government organization known as ""Control"", who uphold the forces of right & goodness against the secret evil organization KAOS, who stand for badness and rottenness.

Assisting 86 in his capers is the beautiful Agent 99 (Barbara Feldon), Agent k-13 (also known as Fang), Agent 44 and the much put upon Chief of Control, Thaddeus (Edward Platt), who always seems to get a headache on special occasions; those occasions being when he's with Smart.

One of the more well known & perhaps controversial villains by today's standards is the Claw (not the Craw, the Craw!) who makes 2 appearances during Season 1, but I guess I'll have to wait until Season 2 before Bernie Kopell shows up as Siegfried.

Overall, Season 1 of ""Get Smart"" was very good & succeeded in wetting my appetite for the following seasons.

The show is truely a comedic masterpiece from the minds of Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, but is taken to another level by the wonderful cast.

1547802,5,B00005JNS8,"I hadn't seen ""Get Smart"" since the 1960s but I must say it hasn't lost any of its' humour or inventiveness. Sprung from the fertile minds of Mel Brooks and Buck Henry this award winning series still packs a humourous punch.
The series quickly put into the /60s pop culture dictionary four main catch-phrases:
""Would you believe?"",""Sorry about that Chief"",""Missed it by that much(with the accompanying index finger over the thumb) and "".....and loving it"".Fact is I find myself to this day periodically saying one of these phrases. I'm not sure what that says about me OR the show(:-)) but that is the impact it had,and it still does.
The show is a huge send up of the then popular spy genre/Cold War theme then front and center, courtesy of Sean Connery and the Bond pictures.
It involves the exploits of one Maxwell Smart,Agent 86,played absolutely brilliantly by Don Adams and his fellow agent,Agent 99,done by Barbara Feldon. Somehow Max in the end manages to solve the cases he is assigned to but more often than not,it is usually in spite of himself. In the process he often sends his beloved chief,played by Edward Platt,into fits of apoplexy,or in the very least supplies him with numerous and recurring headaches!
It is not very hard also to spot alot of Stan Laurel-like facial expressions and reactions in Adam's character,along with many similar gags used throughout the series;which helps explains why the material over all has stood the test of time. And not too surprising to see Laurel and Hardys' influence there as they were hugely popular on TV at that time.
The series won an Emmy Award in its' very first year with the two part ep ""The Ship of Spies"";a take off on the 15th Century book/allegorical story ""A Ship of Fools"".
For those that think this show is a continuous running series of gags and other comedy routines,will be shocked to realize that there are many serious or semi-serious moments that occur throughout. However we know,as the creators remind us subtly and not so subtly,that it is all done tongue in cheek so there is no mistaking what you are watching.
One very funny and recurring set of gags to watch out for throughout this series is Max's dealings with the various devices and paraphernalia he is given to thwart his evil CHAOS opponents with and the many items he talks into which are subbing as phones. The humour is very visual,it can be subtle,but it's always hilarious.
These shows have all been digitally remastered and the transfers are well done. Each ep has an introductory blurb spoken by actress Barbara Feldon(Agent 99) herself(with the option of listening or going right to the ep);like Robert Conrad in the first season of ""The Wild,Wild West"".However I hope,unlike the ""Wild,Wild West"",that Ms. Feldon will continue her spoken intros throughout the series to come. It was so nice to hear her voice.
The original b&w 1/2 hour pilot is also included here;with the rest of the eps all in colour. This is another first for me as I had never seen any of these shows in colour until I viewed them in this set. And the contrast and the colour itself are like they were shot just yesterday. Wonderful.
For anyone of you who have read some of my reviews you will have noticed that since the beginning I have stressed and made special mention of any show that pertains to being of a""family"" nature;that is those that are suitable for family viewing,a rare commodity these days. Well lo and behold for the first time anywhere that I have seen,the back jacket blurb to this set mentions this show as one perfect for ""families"".Are the companies finally catching up? I fervently hope so. I also hope it continues to be a trend. As there are no shows anymore that an entire family can sit down and watch together without fear of a sexual reference or bad language,a show like ""Get Smart"" is the perfect tonic for our times. Universal humour that the whole family can watch,laugh and enjoy TOGETHER.What a concept!",1221177600,,3959,4.747460087082729
1547803,5,B00005JNS8,"I must admit that I didn't grow up on this series.  It was before my time.  Out of all of the comedies out there, this is by far my favorite.  Don Adams as Get Smart is perfect for his role as the spy who can't do anything right in a time period were James Bond reigned supreme.  The perfect antithesis to the spy genre yet so suited for its role. Barbara Feldon adds a bit of common sense to the picture but her constant need to bail Max out of a sticky situation keeps her mixed up in the craziest of antics.  I can watch the episodes over and over again, and they are just as funny as the first time.
  If you are a fan of the 2008 release of Get Smart in theatres, but you have never seen the original series you will fall in love with this disk set.  It gives you the context for phrases such as ""Missed it by that much"" and ""Sorry chief"".  Season 1 features Agent K13 - Fang, which was written out in later season.

This was my favorite show as a kid, and I feared that it might be a mistake to go back and watch it again 35 years later (I saw all of these in early 1970's reruns). Sometimes childhood memories are best left alone. Not so in this case. Yes, there are some lame sitcom elements to the show, but the material still holds up.

The show greatly differs from modern sitcoms--there's obviously not as much emphasis on the ""generates X laughs per minute"" formula. Someone expecting Friends and a zinger every 11 seconds might find themselves bored. Even in the first few episodes you can see character growth, and the shows are centered as much around the stories as around the gags.",1220832000,,947,4.5321637426900585

The show had all kinds of goofy devices: a phone entrance to Control Headquarters, a shoe phone communicator, the ""Cone of Silence"", etc.  Clever catch phrases like, ""Would you believe?""

At the time of this writing, 48 out of 50 reviews, are 5 stars.  That is a strong, positive statement.

There are a few nice cameos in the series too.  ( No spoilers! )

Though I'm 24, I have loved this show FOR-EV-ER since I was 8.  I got the much-coveted gem in the mail the day before yesterday and have watched the first three episodes already.

Don Adams plays Maxwell Smart-Agent 86 of the fictitious Cold-War Era CONTROL, a top-secret Washington-based spy organization whose mission it is to eliminate threats to U.S. society.  Maxwell Smart does not come across as very bright, which makes up the comedy of the show as he makes the most comediac of mistakes (For instance, in the second episode of Season #1, he burns up a secret code BEFORE he is to memorize it) and the Chief, played by Edward Platt, tolerates him.  Barbara Feldon plays 99, the beautiful brunette who tries to amend Smart's mistakes and adds to the comediac atmosphere.

900 minutes (aka 15 hours) of entertainment with spectacular introductions by Barbara Feldon herself.  Completely recommended.",1218153600,,1002,4.9226190476190474
1547934,5,B00005JNS8,"As others have written, this is an abbreviated version of the season 1 and full series being offered by TimeLife.com  but some have not properly noted the EXTRAS on this set. I have both the full set and just picked up this handy season 1 version which surprisingly enough doesn't mention all the BONUS FEATURES on  its packaging.  This version DOES have the pilot  episode in Black and White with both Buck Henry AND Mel Brooks commentaries!  Its a great episode and features Michael Dunn (the diminutive star from  the Wild Wild West!)...this set also features the wonderful episode introductions by Barbara Feldon...so it appears to be exactly the same as the more expensive versions from TimeLife.  The ONLY difference is the bonus DVD..which each season on the timelife version  has...and they are chock full of amazing goodies...from new featurettes, to bloopers, and rare tv appearances from other shows to Emmy Award telecasts..and for me are a MUST.
Super fans ( I  loved this  show  as a child) will want the TimeLife full  set..and  its stunning packaging...casual fans will be thrilled with this more  inexpensive version and may even become super  fans...

I'm only reviewing the DVD and not the series...that's been done very well by others...it was and is a classic and the failure of the big screen version recently only reinforces that fact!!!  I will also add that the episodes look stunningly sharp and colorful...very well presented.

Don Adams was a comic genius and Barbara Feldon played her part with equal parts deadpan humor and adoration...brilliant stuff from a childhood to be cherished..I'm not sure if you didn't experience it the first time how it will hit you but I forgot how  much I loved this show until watching these again...and the classic lines we all said in school...'missed it by that much' ..."" and loving it"" ..""I told you not to tell me that""....wow...how  fun to revisit childhood.",1217894400,25,1927,4.94392523364486

1547938,5,B00005JNS8,"""Would you believe Get Smart Season One hits stores the first week of August?""

""I find that very hard to believe""

""Would you believe all the bonus features have been removed from the Time Life set?""

""I don't think so.""

""How about a cheap version of Season One with all of the great episodes and no extras for $24.99!""

Yup, that's what the dim bulbs at HBO are doing. Season One, bonus feature free, comes out August 5th. Now the episodes are priceless. I know from the Time Life collection that the picture quality is nothing short of stunning. But the bonus features for this series are what really set it head and shoulders above other vintage TV releases.

Here's what's NOT in the retail release of Season One:

1. Buck Henry interview
2.""The Secret History of Get Smart""
3. Adams TV appearances (6 of these)
4. BLOOPERS
5. Excerpts from the Get Smart Reunion Seminar (2003) with Adams and Feldon plus producers, directors and Bernie Kopell talking about the show.
and, probably, no commentaries. And there are 2 on this set.

This is hours of content not included. Wouldn't surprise me if they are saving all this stuff for the big series collection after all the single seasons have been released.

It's a shame they have to remove all this great stuff.

But the show is fantastic and finally on DVD. Completely remastered. I know from having watched all of Season One (I just finished Season Three) that the picture is stunningly clear and sharp. They went to town on the episodes. And Season One has the original pilot that is not shown in syndication because it was done in black and white.

Great show! Better than the lame ""re-imagining"" that's coming on Friday.

Get Smart hitting stores should be joyous news, but with this bare bones edition, it's a bit of a downer. I can't recommend the show highly enough though. And the Time Life version is a darn near perfect DVD release.",1213574400,24,1896,4.626865671641791
1547939,4,B00005JNS8,"Get Smart was one of the funniest spy spoofs ever produced. There's no doubt about that. This set includes every episode of the first season, and they're all beautifully presented. But no spy is complete without his extra gadgets, and that's what's missing from this set.

TimeLife has exclusively offered a FIVE-DISC set packed with bonus features for some time now (users are selling it used & new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/here/dp/B000NI9W30/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">here</a>), but this FOUR-DISC set is the stripped version.

The 4-disc edition does have episode introductions by Barbara Feldon and commentaries on two episodes; but in addition to these, the 5-disc version includes a FULL DISC of extras that includes a featurette, long lost TV appearances by the stars of the show, and excerpts from a Get Smart seminar with several cast members (including Don Adams, himself), to name a few.

If all you want are the regular episodes - which are fantastic, to say the least! - then you'll be happy with the financial savings from buying this set.

Barbara Feldon was very fetching as ""99"" and I think she still is (if she will forgive me of my expression). I can't think of a better sidekick for Agent ""86"".

I enjoyed the extras that came with this DVD set. Some of it was a little lengthly for me but I enjoyed it none the less. It was well worth the money to buy this.

1548024,5,B00005JNS8,"Smart. Maxwell Smart. The dumbest spy in the world, who fights on behalf of the forces of goodness and niceness, and succeeded in making democracy vs. communism a lot more entertaining. With the comic trio of Don Adams, Barbara Feldon and Edward Platt, this hilarious spy spoof is still funny today.

Don Adams is Agent 86, Maxwell Smart, a not-so-bright spy with an endless arsenal of strange devices and odd sayings. The bumbling spy at a top-secret government agency called Control, which tirelessly works to keep the free world free. He's accompanied by his capable partner/love interest Agent 99 (Barbara Feldon), and overseen by the long-suffering Chief (Eward Platt) who puts up with Smart's constant mistakes.

Together with 99 and the Chief (and his faithful dog Fang), Max battles the forces of badness and rottenness -- namely, the anti-Control called KAOS. Among the enemies the Control agents face: the dwarfish ""Mr. Big,"" the fashion forces of evil, spy college, violinists, lethal toys, the Orient Express, fat Arabs, vampires, a likable killer robot, a Chinese mastermind called the Claw, and explosive paintings. And that's only the start...

""Missed it by that much!"" Maxwell Smart's catchphrases and goofy confidence made him the perfect antidote to the suave James Bond, especially since he never has enough money and his gadgets don't work very well. Unlike Bond and similar movie spies, Max succeeds out of luck and bumbling more often than not, but he still succeeds.

The comic timing is a little awkward at the very beginning, but rapidly gets its footing. Most of the comedy comes from the endless spoofery -- Max is the most inept secret agent in history, and he still faces off against all sorts of cartoonish villains with overly elaborate plans.  The dialogue becomes progressively funnier as time goes on: ""I may never get to play with the Philharmonic, but on the other hand, is Leonard Bernstein licensed to kill?""

The political clime of the mid 1960s is all over the series, especially in the form of KAOS. But fortunately they don't get preachy -- KAOS is merely a big evil organization, no more. A few of the references are dated, but most of the humor remains intact. (And fans of political correctness should skip episodes about the Claw and the Indians, funny as they are).

Don Adams is the heart of the series, with his quirky face, nasal voice and odd body language. Hard to tell how he could keep a straight face throughout many of the lines he says (""And loving it!""). Barbara Feldon plays the straight woman to Max's goofiness, while Edward Platt is just wonderful as the long-suffering Chief, who always seems on the edge of either melting down or exploding.

Decades after it was made, this clever spy spoof is still gutsplittingly funny. You'll roll around on the floor, laughing yourself sick... and... loving it.",1175126400,15,2863,4.9376299376299375

The pictures and sound are very clear.  There are lots of bonus features, including commentary on the pilot episode by creators Mel Brooks and Buck Henry (an individual commentary by each).  Barbara Feldon does a short introduction of each episode if chosen through the Episode menu (as opposed to Play All).  I won't go into all the bonus features here, as they would take up a LOT of room.  You can see those on the TimeLife site.  Order up and get ready for some belly laughs.",1164931200,19,657,4.319672131147541
1548026,5,B00005JNS8,"Not too long ago I wrote a review of the book, The Get Smart Handbook written by Joey Green. In the review, I basically made a plea to the universe to bring this show out on DVD. Well, would you believe on November 15, 2006, I will get my wish?

Time-Life is offering The Complete Get Smart Collection. A 25 disc collection featuring every episode digitally remastered. I guess it is selling for approximately $200. It could be $2,000 and I would still buy this classic show.

I have friends' that tell me I am stuck in a time warp because I watch very little television that is actually new. For some reason or another the writing of the older shows far surpass the writing of today's television shows. I watched a rerun of Friends' the other night and I was literally dizzy after watching that show. There were like four stories going on in one show? Have we become that much of an ADD society where we can't just have one show with one plot for thirty minutes? It seems as though everything today is so ""extreme"" and so in your face. I actually get offended at some of the things I have watched and I'm not easily offended.

But this show, Get Smart, conceived by certified ""Wack Jobs"" Mel Brooks and Buck Henry is in a class all by itself. This show is brilliant in every way. The writing, the acting, the production value. It did get a little cheesy when Maxwell Smart and agent 99 got married, but even those episodes were funnier than the stuff that's out there now.

The only thing that I really feel saddened about is that this release is coming after Don Adam's death. For a very long time, Don Adams was my hero. While other kids on the playground pretended to be the Six Million Dollar Man or Batman, I was Secret Agent 86. I used to purposely forget my homework so I could do the ""Would you believe?"" shtick with my teacher.

Mmmmm..it was always funnier on the show than in real life.

Well, I know one of my Christmas presents this year because I am going to buy this collection for myself.

Finaly,I heard that Don Adams died and I hope I'm wrong but stations run weekend marathons on those shows when one of it's stars die(tv Land??.What happened with Get Smart?No Marathon but they don't even air the show,why?Maybe it's about time they Get Smart!!",1146441600,4,911,4.181818181818182
1548171,5,B00005JNS8,"As a classic tv fan, I'm hoping this will be released very soon and also by seasons, not just a ""best of"" type deal.

We agree with the above statement.  Why can't our children enjoy Get Smart too?  A show that is not only extremely funny, but not dirty or in poor taste.

We are turning blue just waiting for it's release  :-(",1146355200,9,327,4.126984126984127
1548172,5,B00005JNS8,"Just to throw it out there, even though it first came out 20 years ago, it's a show for everyone.  I'm a 20 year old college kid and enjoy present day TV shows like Family Guy and South Park, but my favorite TV show of all time, and there is nothing, NOTHING that I would like to have more on DVD, is Get Smart.  No matter who you are, you'll find it funny. Period.  Thank you Don Adams, thank you TV land for showing the reruns (that's where I saw them,) and let's hurry up and get the DVD out shall we?",1133654400,13,504,3.9215686274509802

1548174,5,B00005JNS8,"Here's a show that deserves to be on DVD.  This show was consistently funny and goofy and great.  We showed episodes to our kids when they were 10 & 11 (a perfect age to start appreciating it) and thank you TVLand or Nick at Nite or whoever.  Now we need the DVD.  Siegfried and ""plastic lips"" and my favorite, Hymie the robot.  My husband and I have a gardening tool we can never refer to as anything but ""the Craw"".  It's been fun to read the Amazon reviews to see what other people remember best.  Not every old TV show was a good show, Get Smart was in a class by itself.",1127779200,10,575,4.080357142857143
1548175,5,B00005JNS8,"It's about time this classic was released especially with the passing of Agent 86. RIP Don - and thanks. Let's just hope these are from the masters and not a poor quality made in somebody's home. But, then, maybe Siegfried und Kaos got there first!",1127779200,9,248,4.533333333333333
1548176,5,B00005JNS8,"I think it's about time this series was immortalised on DVD, to leave it in the cone of silence would be criminal! Countless one-liners, sight gags, great cast, this is a fantastic show that I've grown up on, and loving it!

Unfortunately, the 1989 movie and the remake of the TV series missed it by that much, but hopefully from the sad news of Don Adam's death today, will come the old ""sentimental DVD release"" trick.

RIP Don, thanks for the laughs.",1127779200,11,453,4.512195121951219
1548177,5,B00005JNS8,"The Cold War may be over, but this spy series had a combination of fine casting and comedic timing that make it fresh every time I see it.  Lovable heroes and villains bumble their way through running gags and never fail to satisfy.  Just say Cone of Silence, ""Sorry about that, Chief"", or ""Zis is Kaos!"" and I smile.  It's way past time for this masterpiece to be immortalized on disc.",1124323200,6,386,4.408450704225352
1548258,5,B00005JNS8,This is the funniest old show I have ever seen.  I've been waiting a long time to see this on DVD.  Some of the funniest episodes are in the first season.  I hope they release it soon I really want to watch it.,1121990400,5,210,3.8372093023255816
1548259,5,B00005JNS8,"Get Smart will always hold a spot in my heart. I originally watched it in my middle school years on Nick At Nite. I managed to get some friends interested and we would quote Agent 86 during our lunch periods. It's just one of those shows which is best enjoyed with friends.

From the opening ditty as Don Adams strides down the hallway of doors to the final punchline, ""Get Smart"" is always a pleasure to watch. The jokes are still funny, the gags still hold up, and Maxwell Smart's famous, ""Sorry about that, Chief"" will still bring a smile to your face. With Don Adams, Barbara Feldon, Bernie Kopell, Robert Karvelas, and (of course) Edward Platt, it's a cast that can't be beat. This is easily one of the funniest television series I've ever seen.

Now all we need is a DVD release. For those that are interested, an online DVD petition can be found at wouldyoubelieve dot com.",1120953600,11,880,4.49375

1548261,5,B00005JNS8,"With all the crappy shows being released on DVD, why isn't Get Smart! yet availible? It is one of my favorite old sitcoms from my childhood of Nick at Nite addiction. So few shows capture the perfect blend of physical and verbal humor that Get Smart! does. I recently found a novel based on the show, and reading it I became so nostalgic for those sliding doors, telephone booth elevator, shoe phone, and all the great gadgets, cars, and secret agents. Release the series, there's tons of fans who want it! Please!!!",1118102400,12,516,4.619565217391305
1548262,5,B00005JNS8,I really need this on DVD so I can fully explain 'The Cone of Silence' to my boyfriend.....he has never seen the show so my weak attempts explaining do nothing w/o a visual backup ....so lets get on this so all my references to this classic don't sound so lame.,1116979200,9,261,4.24
1548263,5,B00005JNS8,"The show was very funny but perhaps the one thing that I was most impressed with as a child was Maxwell Smart's shoe phone and all the other gadgets.

During the 1960s, a telephone was a telephone and it was not supposed to look like anything other than a telephone. The idea of a shoe phone was in itself a revolutionary idea and perfect for comedy. Even more impressive was the ""sock phone"" in case Max had to remove his shoes before walking on an expensive carpet.

It wasn't too long afterward that the novelty phone industry came about .. and I'm willing to bet it was this TV series that inspired the entire industry. There is now a beer can telephone, a bowling pin phone, a Darth Vader phone to commemorate Star Wars, and there is even a football phone.

What they need now is a phone shaped like a slice of pizza so Maxwell Smart and others can make a phone call during a pizza party. Imagine holding a slice of pizza to your ear. Why not a KFC piece of chicken phone, or perhaps an ice cream cone phone. That would be a ""cool"" idea.",1116547200,7,1042,4.252525252525253
1548264,5,B00005JNS8,"Get Smart is my type of humor. Don Adams as Agent 86 leaves me laughing so hard i'm breathless. This series relied very heavily on ""sight gags"" that Adams has down pat. I have waited for years for this series to come out on DVD while I see a constant stream of little known, seldom watched shows being released on DVD. I hope that ""Get Smart"" is soon to be released as i'll be first in line to buy it. R.G. Hooper",1115942400,6,413,4.048780487804878
1548265,5,B00005JNS8,"My first introduction to Get Smart came from watching reruns on Nick at Night and then on TVLand.  I was in high school at the time and thought that the show was hilarious.  The episodes are a perfect blend of gadgets, action, romance, humor, reoccuring characters, and memorable one liners.  I don't have a favorite season because I loved every episode!  Please release all 5 seasons on DVD ASAP!!",1115856000,3,398,4.72463768115942
1548266,5,B00005JNS8,"Why has Get Smart not yet been released on DVD? It simply boggles my mind because this is about the funniest show I have ever watched. I grew up with Get Smart and its good natured spy humor.

If you are like me, you think of Siegfried and not Doc Bricker when you think of Bernie Kopel. the only character that comes to mind when you think of Dick Gautier is Hymie the Robot. the great Edward Platt will always be The Chief and Barbara Feldon's character 99 will always be the ever faithful comic foil and love interest to Maxwell Smart, Secret Agent 86 of CONTROL.

All of Get Smart's legion of fans want to see the return of Leadside, and the Tequila Mockingbird, and the Craw NOT the Craw!, and Agent 13, and Stocker, and Harry Hoo The Famous Hawaiian Detective, and the Groovy Guru, and Destructo, and Mary Jack Armstrong the Strongest Woman Alive, and the lovable King of Coronia, and TBO The Big One, and well the list can and does go and on!

Please, please give us EVERY season of Get Smart on DVD! I am begging you PLEASE! PLEASE!! PLEASE!!!

7941271,4,B00005JNS8,Seller is great BUT the series as a whole is kind of 60's campy.  Some episodes are very good and some are just kind of redundant with the campy humor-it was only $10 so I wasn't out a lot.,1520121600,,189,3.8461538461538463

Which I didn't remember and then the rest of the shows are in color.  This is excellent.  Close to a perfect 5 stars.,1491177600,,448,4.127906976744186
