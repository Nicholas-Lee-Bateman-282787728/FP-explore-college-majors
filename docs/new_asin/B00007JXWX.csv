1815839,5,B00007JXWX,"I just got back from seeing this film at the theater, and I was just blown away.  The acting was brilliant and the story flowed very well.  The film is about a teen, Igby, who comes from a very disfunctional family.  He does horribly in all the schools he is sent to, and he decides to live with his god father's mistress secretly while avoiding another military school.  I don't want to give much away, so I'll just end here.  I highly reccomend this film to anyone who can appreciate great acting and an overall great film.  Go see this if it is playing in your area!",1032652800,,569,4.271028037383178
1815840,5,B00007JXWX,"Igby Goes Down is a splendid coming of age story that proves to be quietly moving and influencial. Kirean Culkin proves that the Culkin brothers can do alot more than just look cute as he plays a smart, independent 17 year old whose family values were torn early in his life when his unhinged father (Bill Pullman) and mother divorced, and all that followed was abuse, neglect, and drug use.  Underneath its darkness, the film manages to find sorrow and pitty in the hearts of its audience.  It never seems to sugar coat itself and turn into one of those sappy and unconvincingly sentimental dramas but remains poigniant and piercing.  Denfinitely one of the year's very best films.",1032652800,2,682,4.762711864406779
1815841,5,B00007JXWX,"Igby, how low can he go? Does selling [narcotics] to his third grade
art teacher count? Played by the irresistible Kieran Culkin, Igby is
a 17 year old (almost 18) boy on the verge of self discovery in
many ways. Sex, [narcotics], and the occasional beat down is what
he'll find along the way. After being expelled from multiple schools,
and escaping military school, Igby decides to take control of his
life, and no one was going to stop him. Not his dying mother, or
his adulterous Godfather/father. As a boy, Igby witnessed the
destruction of his father's mental health, including a heart-wrenching
moment in a bathroom shower. But he remained strong willed, until
the assisted suicide of his own mother brought him to tears of
emotional comfort and distortion. Love is only how you perceive it,
whether it be from life, liberty, or the pursuit of happiness, it can be
found in some shape, form, or way.
I really liked this movie. But not because it was an independent movie
that makes you reestablish your own existence, but because I really
enjoyed the performances by Culkin and Danes, as well as the crafty
story-telling that was involved in this low-gloss film. Dark it is, funny,
no doubt, essential viewing? why not? Makes you wonder if love is
truly meant to be found. ... One thing I learned from Igby is that you shouldn't be
afraid of change. You should actually force change to come and take
command. ...
Planning: I kept on thinking about this while watching the movie. Igby
really didn't have any plans, and the ones he did have would shatter in
front of him like his face to a fist. I don't have any direct plans in my
life right now. I do have a goal, but plans seem so awkward and sort
of obstructive. ...
But Igby manages to keep it all together, through all the drama, all the
heart-ache, and all the sultry $100 bills given away as bribes by is
Godfather/father. Susan Surandon was brilliant as Mimi, and Bill
Pullman was surprisingly convincing as the schizoid-angst father, Jason.
Claire Danes wore nothing but tight-stretch jeans, so she was certainly
not an eye-sore. All in all, I was very very satisfied with this film. Go
see it for yourself, or catch it on video.",1032566400,,2194,4.628205128205129
1815842,1,B00007JXWX,"Igby is a [similar character] Holden Caulfield.  Just like Salinger's hero, Igby gets kicked out of prep school and begins a descent into the gritty neighborhoods of New York City.  This is where the similarities stop, however, because Igby Goes Down is anything but a masterpiece. Instead, it's a rather sloppy and plot-less movie with flat characters who try too hard to be eccentric and original.
The title of the movie refers to the mental breakdown of Igby's father -- a breakdown that Igby has witnessed as a small child and which undoubtably haunts him.  In this film, ""Going Down,"" seems to be a type of feeling one gets when the world becomes too much. And for Igby, everything is too much, especially his cold mother (Susan Sarandon) and flat brother (Ryan Philipee) who are simply emotionless.  The only person he can connect with is a girl named Sookie who he runs away to New York with.
I wanted very much to like this movie.  But it was filled with rather spoiled teenagers who seem to be fighting about something that isn't really there.  I wanted this movie to end very quickly.",1032566400,4,1094,4.671875
1815843,4,B00007JXWX,"One of 2002's better films, ""Igby Goes Down"" presents a literate and entertaining look at today's preppie youth. Although the film touches on all of the painfully tired facets of this genre (drugs, sex, teen-angst), the intelligence and heart of this comedy propel it to the head of its class.
Igby is a troublemaking high-schooler with an institutionalized father, a selfish and drug addled mother, and a straight-laced brother. He rebels, runs away, falls in love, takes up with a liberal crowd, and searches for his place in the world. He meets colorful characters, has unpleasant adventures, and eventually finds an inner peace.
A top-notch cast perfectly delivers the film's dark humor. Susan Sarandon captures not only her character's selfish spirit, but also the emotional emptiness that drives her, and Jeff Goldblum gives one of his best performances as the cocky and morally corrupt stepfather who takes an interest in Igby. The big surprise is the witty and knowing performace of Kieran Culkin in the title role. Macaulay's brother proves a far more adept performer than his sibling, and captures Igby's intelligence, anger, and generosity of spirit, seemingly without effort.
Unfortunately, the talentless Ryan Phillipe is completely miscast as the over-achieving brother. He looks the part, but the young actor rarely seems to understand what he's saying, and therefore can only present the outline of an educated WASP and not a fully realized character. But, at the same time, the idea that someone as inarticulate as Phillippe could even get an interview at Columbia may be the film's biggest joke.",1032480000,2,1613,5.207692307692308

It's not an uncommon story in any way, and while all the pieces might not be in any one real-life story, they come together nicely here in the movie. Some might be reminded of the real-life story of the Menendez brothers, but the movie is a case of euthanasia versus the cold-blooded murder by the Menendez brothers.

1815929,5,B00007JXWX,"What I found ironic about this film is that we have this preconceived notion that money equates happiness yet Igby clearly demonstrates that that is clearly not that case. Money is a non-issue but tragedy still strikes and of course we can't chose our family. Igby shows us that bad things happen to ALL people, we are merely given a part to play, it is our duty to play it well (or poorly). It makes it clear that life isn't so bad because we are all in the same boat with different challenges that we all need to overcome. The best part is that this film doesn't end on a happy ending, rather a new beginning with more to come (hopefully). A movie worth watching.",1367971200,,665,4.328

The movie itself was somewhat entertaining, but as usual, it had a lot of filthy language, as hollywood thinks people love filthy language, but we do not.  I feel it would have been better without it. Also, Susan Sarandon, not a great actress, but since her role was limited in this movie, her presence in the movie did not take away from it too much.",1367798400,,583,4.243243243243243
1815932,3,B00007JXWX,"Looking at the environment central character Igby (Kieran Culkin) has to cope with, we cannot help but sympathize with him.  An over-ambitious mother (Susan Sarandon), a supercilious, well-educated brother (Ryan Philippe), an egotistical godfather (Jeff Goldblum), all conspire to make his life unbearable.  The film is a study in self-absorption, and how it can damage people: Igby is one victim, and so are the two young women Sookie (Clare Danes) and Rachel (Amanda Peet).  In the end Igby gains a pyrrhic revenge on both his mother and godfather, and finally understands why his father ended up in a Maryland mental hospital.  The film is full of prison images; bars on the windows, claustrophobic rooms, hospital wards staffed by over-enthusiastic nurses.  Even Gore Vidal turns up briefly at the beginning of the film as a Catholic priest, the principal of a repressive high school where Igby simply doesn't fit in.  Culkin gives a winning performance as Igby, displaying a virtuosity beyond his years.  The film has its comic moments, but its portrayal of a contemporary world set in and around New York is simultaneously very disturbing.",1363305600,,1145,5.1567567567567565
1815933,4,B00007JXWX,"I really love these weird independent comedies, that you have to be somewhat intelligent to understand. They are so much different from all the repetitive crap that we are subjected to over and over again. This is the story of a kid from a privileged family who just doesn't fit in. He sees the hypocrisy of it all and decides to run away to NYC, where he meets some unique characters that you'd only find in New York. The middle Culkin brother, Kieran, stars and was incredible. Simply put, sometimes the story is good, but the movie is made by its star, and Culkin gives one of the best performances I've seen in a film like this. Igby Goes Down has a ton of stars, it's a clever story, and you really connect to the characters. I really enjoyed this film, but be warned, it's not for everybody. I honestly believe when it comes to this type of film, you need a personality that relates to some aspect of the film. Without that connection, you might not get as much out of this film as others did.",1361577600,,999,4.347593582887701

1815935,5,B00007JXWX,"There are many films that attempt to capture the complexities of teen wonderment with biting sarcasm and emotional dramatics, and many of them fall on their faces.  `Igby Goes Down' is one that continues to fascinate me because it got almost everything right in a way that many teen films (or films merely involving teens) could only dream of.  The script is tight and memorable, littered with quotable lines that keep the audience interested and coming back for more.  But it is more than a barrage of one-liners that make us laugh.  There is a heart here that beats with paunch and poignancy.

The cast is a who's who of talent, and all of them prevail.  Susan Sarandon (one of the greats) takes top honors as Igby's overbearing and eccentric mother, but Danes, Peet, Pullman, Goldblum and especially Culkin really hold their own and create a unified ensemble that all make a desired impact.

For a film that presents a family so bizarrely entertaining they are far-fetched to the core, `Igby Goes Down' maintains the needed amount of intimacy and genuineness that makes it believable despite being improbable (if that makes any sense).  You are never turned off by the eccentricity because the film understands how to use it as an advantage to make the film feel whole and complete.  Young Igby's life lessons are delivered with a relevancy that transcends the surface texture of some heavily lauded works like `The Catcher in the Rye', a novel I find highly overrated and devoid of what it promises.  `Igby Goes Down' is a fun and fresh take on the world of the American teenager, a world that is far more complicated than one would imagine.",1344297600,2,1645,4.76056338028169
1815936,4,B00007JXWX,"Like ""Catcher In The Rye"" this is a blueblood teen who just wants to abandon his tedious and pointless life.  Having his father locked up as a schizophrenic obviously left him much less inclined than his older brother to play the game and pretend everything is alright.  Great acting makes this material seem richer than it is.  You understand everyone's desire to smack Igby but also understand his desire to avoid the smug superficial adults ordering him around.",1341792000,,464,4.923076923076923

The family does not connect, no warm hugs and love is there.  His cold fish mother ""MiMi"" (Susan Sarandan) married Jason, a father who is mentally ill (Bill Pullman), and cannot be a strong role model for his two sons. He has a mental breakdown in front of a 5 year old Igby that would faze anyone.  Igby's brother, Oliver (Ryan Phillippe) is three years older, and the perfect son, and handles the family issues best of all.  The movie's focus is when Igby is 17 years old.  Igby has never been able to live up to his brother's ideal.  Igby refuses to follow his brother's high achievement level.  His mother, Mimi, is constantly critical of his performance and berates him in front of Oliver.  Of course, Igby rebels against everything his mother demands of him.  Mimi is aloof, distant and cold, her sons call her ""MiMi"" not ""Mother"", even though she has a terminal illness.  Mimi is caluclating and uses all her determination and wit to get Igby to be the other ""perfect son.""

Igby struggles to find himself and escape from Mimi's manipulation and demands.  She fights Igby's rebellion by enrolling him in military school after being let go from fancy East Coast prep schools.  Igby refuses to be contained and escapes with his mother's credit card to enjoy a hotel spending spree.  His very rich godfather D.H. (Jeff Goldbloom) is sent by Mimi to give Igby direction and guidance until the next semester of school starts.  He takes Igby to New York City and Igby has many adventures and experiences with women and the cold cruel real world.  Igby meets Rachel (Amanda Peet) who happens to be the mistress of his godfather.  She is a dancer and choreographer and gives D.H. a break from his goofy, drunken wife.  Igby also meets Sookie Sapperstein Claire Danes) at one of his godfather's parties in the Hamptons.  She is also an outsider like Igby and they meet again after the party and become friends.

Igby succeeds for a while in New York, and loses contact from his family.  He lives in Rachel's loft and falls in love with Sookie.  He learns much from the school of hard knocks, but he also realizes he is not alone; everyone is dealing with problems.  He also learns he can't emotionally divorce his family when Mimi is on her death bed.  Facing his love/hate and being with his mother in her last moments gives him the emotional release he needs.

The movie is complex, dramatic, funny, wildly witty, touching and strangely positive.  Igby faces his past, resolves his angst and moves on to positively face his future.  The casting is perfect and Kieran Culkin does an excellent acting job on a very difficult character.",1261353600,,2780,4.699792960662526

The movie is something of a treatise on the emptiness of well-moneyed society (it's quite different from the emptiness of poorly-moneyed society). Goldblum moves with an inner light of vicious cunning and leering evil, all done up in Central Park West finery. And Culkin convincingly portrays a badly damaged kid, Igby, for whom failure should be not an option but the only possible outcome. Yet he shows an inner light, small and sometimes flickering fitfully, that could mean of all the lives we see examined in the story, it is Igby's life that does not go down.",1244937600,,641,4.889908256880734

Haunted by his father Jason (Bill Pullman)'s breakdown when he was little Igby lashes out at  his mother Mimi (Susan Sarandon) who is constantly putting her husband down. Mimi dotes on Igby's older brother Oliver (Ryan Phillippe) who is being molded in her image which causes resentment between him and Igby. Igby is constantly mouthing off which has resulted in his expulsion from numerous schools. His mother, in a last ditch effort to straighten Igby out, enrolls him in a military academy. Ingenious Igby finds a way to misbehave there as well and at the first chance he gets he escapes and hightails it to Manhattan where his rich godfather D.H. (Jeff Goldblum) lives. D.H. offers Igby a job for the summer and Igby meets Rachel (Amanda Peet) who is D.H.'s mistress. She rents a loft from D.H. and  Igby asks  if he can hide out there. Rachel hesitantly agrees as long as he takes the proper precautions to insure that D.H. will never know about it. Now that Igby is amongst the rich and privileged he attends his first Hamptons party where he meets Sookie (Claire Danes). Igby  teases her about her name but Sookie doesn't seem to mind. Something about Igby interests her and the two start hanging out and getting to know each other. Sookie wants to know why Igby is so mad at his family and what he plans on doing with his life. After much playful teasing and Igby's sarcastic answers he opens up to Sookie and tells her that he is scared of being alone and that he  wants someone to go with him. The two begin a romance that is very sweet to watch thanks to the brilliant acting of Culkin and Danes. With a spacious loft and a hot girl to take there things are  looking up for Igby. Igby's family eventually spoil things for him once again. Rachel o.d.'s at D.H.'s loft and in the process of getting her to the hospital D.H. learns  that Igby has been staying there. The next day Oliver pays Igby a visit and informs him that their mother is dying of cancer. While Oliver is in Manhattan he meets Sookie and he tells her what Igby won't about their childhood and their father's illness. Sookie falls for him which gives Igby further reason to hate his brother. All alone and with no place to go Igby has to find the strength in himself to forgive his family and move on with his life. Igby Goes Down is very similar to many a teen film that has come before it most notably the Graduate or Garden State but what makes this film stand apart is its brilliant writing and sensitive portrayals of the characters. The film is full of wicked laughs courtesy of Igby who uses his sarcasm as a shield against others and who can always be counted on for coming up with a funny put down. Balancing out the humor are very emotional and sensitive  scenes that deal with the effects that a serious illness has on a family. In the last act of the film Igby pays a visit to both his dying mother and his institutionalized father and the scenes are heartbreaking to watch. Even if a film tells a familiar story it can still be something special if it is done well and Igby Goes Down is proof of that.",1235692800,,3222,4.421585160202361
1815962,3,B00007JXWX,"Looking back, it seems American indie filmmakers in the late 90's, early millenial were just crawling over each other to find a way of representing the more dysfunctional family.  Igby Goes Down is a good movie, and has its exceptional moments, but time is already starting to drag on this one.

Igby is rich, he keeps getting kicked out of school, his father is insane, he hates his mother, his brother is a ""Young Republican"", his Godfather is Jeff Goldblum, and he just is feeling so darned existential all the time.  He runs around New York being phony (hence the thousands of people comparing him to Holden Caulfield), attends parties in which he feels alienated (hence the thousands of people comparing him to Ben Braddock), and purposefully attempts to make things awkward to get the attention of his mother (hence my comparing him to Harold Chasen).  He's also a teenager's wish fulfillment fantasy as he manages to sleep with hot women who are either not concerned with having a relationship or pleasantly reject him so that he can feel more alienated, run around New York being gloomy and hep, and, well, get his parents out of the way from time to time.

Hey, I'm not complaining: all of that is good justification for watching this movie.  However, not all of it was all that great.  One of the things that kind of ruined it for me was the character Sookie's relationship with Igby and his brother.  Now, I'm sorry, but who starts relationships with two brothers based entirely on their bemoaning hatred of their mother?  Really, who does that?  ""Oh, give me more of that angry childhood trauma, baby, you talk so sexy...""

Nonetheless, most of the beginning is funny, the scene that bookmarks the movie is really cool, and its episodic structure helps it keep moving (this movie is kind of like the weather: if you don't like the scene, it will probably soon change).

Anyway, cute film.

1815966,2,B00007JXWX,"Igby Goes Down (Burr Steers, 2002)

Igby Goes Down, the first film for director Burr Steers (who has yet to make a second in the intervening five years, which should tell you something), commits the cardinal sin of being a comedy that's not funny. It wants to be funny, but never quite gets there. It has some arresting scenes and some relatively witty one-liners coupled with some excellent performances, but the movie never comes together; it just kind of sits there like a failed souffle.

Igby (Kieran Culkin) is a cynical kid from New York City who has a pretty hard time fitting in. His mother (Susan Sarandon) is a drugged-out harridan, his father (Bill Pullman) is insane, his mother's new boyfriend (Jeff Goldblum) is trying too hard to be his friend, and his brother (Ryan Phillippe) is, in Igby's words, a young republican. Then, at a party, he meets two older women, Rachel (Amanda Peet) and Sookie (Claire Danes), and oh, here comes the beginning of teen angst. Which one does he have more feelings for? Etc.

The performances, in short, carry the movie. The wonderful, and woefully underrated, Jared Harris (b. Monkey), as Rachel's roommate, steals every scene he's in. This is the first time I've seen Susan Sarandon in a movie where I haven't loathed her in twenty-five years. Goldblum gives his best performance since The Fly, and Phillippe finally shows that the praise justifiably heaped on him after Cruel Intentions wasn't all wasted. That Danes is excellent should surprise no one at this point. That leaves Pullman, who doesn't get enough screen time to make much of an impression, and Peet, who's just kind of there (which is surprising, she's normally quite good).

Unfortunately, those performances sit atop a rather large mound of nothing. The script has all the wit, verve, and style of a Perez Hilton special on VH1 (and for those of you who may be misinterpreting that metaphor, let me spell it out for you: I hate Perez Hilton with the burning heat of a thousand suns). The plot is nonexistent, but there's not enough coherence for the movie to be character-driven, even despite the fantastic performances. There's no pacing to speak of, nothing remarkable about the direction, camerawork, or sound, etc. It's not thoroughly awful, but it's definitely not one for repeat viewing. **",1192060800,,2313,4.892857142857143
1815987,5,B00007JXWX,"Kieran Culkin should have exploded on the scene after this film was released, for his performance is one of those subtle acts of brilliance that doesn't so often come around, especially not with young talent who's soul obsession seems to be to star in those pointless teen comedies.  In this brilliantly scripted and superbly cast film, Culkin plays young Igby Slocumb, a confused adolescent who lives in the shadow of his schizophrenic father Jason (Pullman), eccentric and at times downright unbearable mother Mimi (Sarandon) and his pompous jerk of a brother Oliver (Phillippe).

Trying to avoid yet another boarding school, Igby seeks refuge in the loft rented by dancer Rachel (Peet) who just so happens to rent from Igby's godfather D.H. (Goldblum) who is also having an affair with Rachel.  Igby takes a liking to Rachel, but also to Sookie (Danes), a young beauty whom he meets at a party held by D.H. on evening.  As Igby struggles with what to do with his life, and how to best avoid his mother, he's brought to many crossroads with his relationships with these two women.

Kieran perfectly captures the sarcasm and teenage wit that surrounds Igby and serves as a prominent young star.  In fact the entire cast was perfectly placed in their assigned roles, each one bringing the right amount of themselves to each character to create a believable and enjoyable ride.  Who better to play the cocky older brother than Ryan Phillippe who just brings this arrogance to almost every one of his roles?  The leading ladies, Danes, Sarandon and Peet, all bring so much life to their characters, so much authenticity.  It was also neat to see Kieran's younger brother Rory getting to play Igby in flashbacks (that Rory is also a very talented kid, just see `You Can Count on Me').

`Igby Goes Down' is one of my favorite films of 2002, one that definitely breaks into my top five, and is one I'm sure most everyone will enjoy.  It's a nice detour from the average teen dramady for it has intelligence and originality and is wonderfully acted, littered with genuine talent, and will be a film that's remembered for years to come.  Why they can't make more films like this I'll never know!",1165881600,3,2188,4.774535809018568
1815988,5,B00007JXWX,"Kieran Culkin seems typecasted to play snotty brats, but in this movie it pays off as Kieran gives an excellant performance along with the rest of the cast(and shows excellent future potential).  Excellent, cold chilling performances are given by Goldblum, Ryan Phillipe, Sarandon, & Amanda Peet.  While Pullman & Clare Danes give performances of a warmer nature that help add a vital element of sympathy to the tale.

Many people seem to have written off ""Igby Goes Down"" for an odd intense dislike of the characters portrayed.  While some of the characters aren't the most likeable people, they never were meant to be, the movie isn't meant to be some perky teen drama filled with lucky how to do characters, its meant to show some more of the cold, intense and disturbing characters you'll find in real life walking down the street.

Igby maybe not be the perfect person, he's just a character trying to find his way in an also imperfect world.

The movie also does a bit of genre bending, although probably best considered a drama meets black comedy.  The dialouge is razor sharp, the characters (while not always likeable) are interesting in their own ways, and oddly enough I find the overall theme oddly comforting.  A ""at some point, whats real will shine though"" moral to end the film.

The ideology of the character is very similar to that of Holden from Catcher in the Rye, but this movie still maintains its uniqueness.  The main character is born into a world of privilege, but he is afraid to walk the path to success that has been laid for him because of his father's mental breakdown.  Rather than allow himself to eventually become like his father, he decides to rebel by quiting school, sleeping with older women, and taking drugs.

Look, I know everyone thinks Freud was wrong about homosexuality's derivation related to weak fathers and strong Ethel Merman like mothers, but this film is set up in such a way that I am convinced that the two brothers could not possibly be straight.  I think that is a defect in the plot.  Sexually they are normal, having sex with two beautiful girls, but, nahhh, I don't believe it from all the perversion of their world; why would they be straight?

Black comedies are by definition laughs from unexpected sources, but we at least have to like the characters in a film to care about their problems. By the end of this film, I wanted Igby to do drugs and die.",1139961600,3,974,4.773809523809524

Forget the stupid and idiotic reasons people gave for handing this movie less than 5 stars, the movie captures it's fair share of genres including, romance, drama, and yes comedy.  Did the director or screenwriters try and poke fun at certain touchy subjects like breast cancer, perhaps but inadvertently so.  It's a dark comedy in some aspects, certainly a coming of age piece and yet I found myself drawn to Igby.  Brash and immature yes, yet his sharp wit reminded me of myself, his nasty older brother  played by the acting genious or Ryan Phillipe, reminded me of the snobby private school types with lots of money whom which I unfortunately had the fate of going to school with, and don't forget Claire Danes in this bubbly performance, she takes your breath away with her beauty and grace.  The movie can relate to many people who have struggled to find themselves among the everybodys.  It may not be for heroine addicts however....

1815992,2,B00007JXWX,"""Igby Goes Down"" has been repeatedly compared to ""Catcher in the Rye"" and I really have to wonder why. Holden Caulfield struggled to find real people in a world filled with phonies and he failed. Igby Slocum on the other hand is a semi-sympathic [...] rich kid who fights valiantly not to make the transition from phoney-in-training to the real thing.

""Catcher in the Rye"" comparisons aside, ""Igby Goes Down"" is neither compelling nor funny. (With the exception of Igby's razor-sharp quips.) I didn't have any affection for the characters, but I must commend the actors for their perfomances.

Spoiler Alert! The film's worst moments come near the end.  The mother drifts into death and Igby's emotions come pourimg out,a mixture of deep sadness and searing anger. ""this is the only time I've ever felt somewhat close to her and she's dead"" Igby tells his brother Oliver, to which he replies ""you beat up her corpse"" I don't think the chuckle that remark elicted from me was worth robbing the scene of its dramatic power. Then it gets worse. Igby is assigned the duty of informing people of his mother's death. He starts out by introducing himself and the person on the other end inevitanlely asks to speak to his mother and he replies ""you can't she's dead"" As someone whose mother is a breast cancer survivor (the disease from which Igby's mother dies) I really didn't find this last bit funny.",1126396800,3,1397,4.764462809917355
1815993,5,B00007JXWX,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, probably because I hadn't even heard of it until it was old enough to be on TV.  I honestly wasn't expecting much...But now this really is one of my favorite movies. It's smart, funny, and actually portrays the dynamics of a dysfunctional family in a way that isn't cheezy, sappy, or overly cynical.  Igby is obviously a take on Holden Caulfield, but I think it's a well-done take.  There are similarities to The Catcher in the Rye (like Igby's ""I hate phonies"" attitude and how he's kicked out of multiple fancy schools), but this film has its own charm, too.  You can't go wrong with such a great cast, quirky characters, and dialogue like this:

Sookie: You call your mother ""Mimi?""

Igby: ""Heinous One"" is a bit cumbersome.

[Sookie nods]

Igby: And Medea was taken.",1117497600,2,812,4.669014084507042
1815994,3,B00007JXWX,"Like Salinger's ""Catcher In The Rye,"" this film is a study in upper class interpersonal dysfunctionality.  However, set in contemporary times and in cinematic rather than book format, it doesn't quite pack the same unified wallop of the novel.

Part of the reason why is because this film demands several sizable suspensions of disbelief, namely in the central anti-hero's sexual accomplishments with two women who are way way out of his league: Amanda Peet, playing a heroin-junkie of a paid girlfriend to his godfather, and Claire Danes, as a hilariously pretentious but overall decent JAP.  Besides severly testing the viewer's credulity, this also contradicts one of Holden Caulfield's most poignant traits: his total ineptitude with the fairer sex.  In fact, Igby's resemblance to Holden mainly lies in his getting kicked out of one private school after another, occasional attempts at fibbing, occasional bouts of profanity, and serving as human punching bag on more than one occasion (the martyr complex).

Kieran Culkin is a fine actor, but the script makes him into too much of a conventional hero rather than the prickly anti-hero of Salinger's novel.  The film is saved however by solid performances from the strong cast, especially Jeff Goldblum and Susan Sarandon, and many witty and well-written bits of dialogue.  I especially enjoyed Igby's explanation of the word ""vegetarian"" as a character description.

Lastly, one of the many pleasures of Salinger's novel is its totally open-ended, unresolved ending---in contrast to this film's quasi deus-ex-machina which provides for a bit more high drama bordering on tragedy and ties up too many loose ends.

Anybody else smell a focus group at work here?",1114387200,5,1715,5.275735294117647
1815995,5,B00007JXWX,When I first saw this movie I knew that it was one that I was able to relate to - Igby's struggle of not wanting to be a part of a government that has failed him and the few people he cares able.  It's surprising to me that the people I know who have seen this movie have not been able to relate to it even though they seem to come from simular lives.  I guess not many people are able to understand and relate to this movie so well.,1109548800,2,433,3.8
1816016,3,B00007JXWX,"I know the comparison is a too easy way to talk about 'Igby Goes Down' but I cannot help it.  Anyone who read 'The Catcher in the Rye' will never fail to recognise the disillusioned voice of that boy here.  And Igby, a rich, malcontent boy who keeps running away from establishment, is played by Kieran Culkin, who is good at showing this disillusion.  So why not compare?

The story begins with a slightly comic touch, and then changes the tone in the second half.  But as I said before, it is nothing original except one thing that you see at that opening (though that may not be as original as I think).  Anyway, the film is about Igby, 17-years old, surrounded by adults who just don't understand him, at least, so he thinks.  No school can interest him, as is the case with this type of film, and out of spite or whim, Igby runs away from the institutions to which his worried and high-strung mother Mimi (Suzan Sarandon) sent.

So, Igby goes down, involved with love affairs, or some chemical substances too (though the film's tone remains very understated).  And of course you see dysfunctional family of Ibgy too; besides Mimi, Bill Pullman plays mentally ill father, and Ryan Phillips appears as apparently icy, detached brother of Igby.

And of course, again, Igby meets many people in a big city; an elder and sexy lady Amanda Peet, a rich but shady gentleman in expensive suit 'D.H.' (very good Jeff Goldblum with oily speaking), a lovely girl Sookie (Claire Danes) who just doesn't know what she should do, or just doesn't care; and 'an artist' (so he says) Jared Harris.

So far, nothing new. The recommendable things about 'Igby' are, in my book, its great cast, and mostly good acting from them, especially Ms. Sarandon.  Even while she sleeps in bed, she can attract you with well-measured acting (and that's true, see the opening, like I said).

The film, however, is given little creactive energy, which is  found in Salinger's book abound, and the quirky characters including Igby himself, though they are interesting to some extent, fail to impress us much because, I am afraid, they are too self-involved.  They appear too unemotional, or apathetic sometimes, to make us care them, and the film itself as a result.

Mostly well-acted, 'Igby Goes Down' will attract you if you like Salinger's classic novel.  But I don't think the film added something new to say about the disillusioned hero of our time.",1101168000,2,2425,4.72209026128266
1816017,5,B00007JXWX,"For those days when your own family seems all wrong watch this movie! It is a funny, tragic and beautifully quirky look at family life with a fantastic cast to pull it off.

The writers for this film are very talented as they blend tragedy into a comic reality that somehow works. Igby (Kieran Culkin) just wants to grow up feeling important and ultimately loved. Unfortunately he belongs to a crazed and selfish family of mismatched efforts and gets lost in the entire dramatic shuffle. His mother (Susan Sarandon) is the ultimate drama queen only accepting what is right from her demented throne and harshly judging anything that falls short. Her husband (Bill Pullman), eventually cracks from the stress and breaks down right in front of poor young Igby's eyes. So life continues for Igby as he is shuffled from private school to military school and never quite grows up. Upon returning to New York he begins work for his eccentric and arrogantly obnoxious god father (Jeff Goldblum) and begins an affair with his god father's mistress (Amanda Peet), a drug popping dancer who never dances. Along for the rest of the ride are notables Claire Danes (playing a college girl on hooky) and Ryan Phillippe, as Igby's irritatingly perfect big brother. This cast is phenomenal with every actor playing their part to a tee and no one upending another.

I had no idea what to expect from this film but was pleasingly surprised as I related to the irony found in this misfit family. You may find characters that remind you of your own crazy relatives or you may be thankful for the lack of similarity as well! Overall this film is funny and sad sometimes exactly at the same time and you have to wonder how it all works.

1816018,4,B00007JXWX,"This unconventional film about a teenage boy struggling to escape the  crushing pressures in his life defies categorization.  While one could describe it as a dark comedy, it is funny only in places, and then in a desperate, cynical way.  But it doesn't take itself as seriously as a true drama.  ""Igby Goes Down"" works best as a film that is what it is:  the story of Igby (Kieran Culkin), who has been kicked out of every private school his mother Mimi (Susan Sarandon) has enrolled him in and who goes on the lam to avoid the next one.  Igby's father (Bill Pullman) has been in a mental hospital for the past six years, and his mother is a snooty matron dying of breast cancer who spends her time fiercely trying to get Igby into yet another school.  His brother Oliver (Ryan Phillippe) is  a snobbish self-important Columbia undergrad.  Igby's life is truly messed up, and no one can stand to be in his company for long before they feel like hitting him.  The one thing Igby has going for him is an often charming wit, and that, combined with so many things beyond his control, endears him to the viewer.
Culkin shows surprising range as Igby, moving convincingly from sarcastic to resourceful to desperate - and back again to sarcastic.  Claires Danes is spunky and perfectly edgy as the Bennington drop-out Sookie, and Amanda Peet is even better as the sensual non-dancer dancer and junkie Rachel.  Jeff Goldblum turns in a fine performance as DH, Igby's godfather, who, as Oliver says, is finely-tuned for only one thing:  making money.  Susan Sarandon seems to float through this movie until the end, when she, too, reveals astonishing aspects of her character.  Every last character is this film is quirky.
This is an offbeat, unpredictable film that mainstream film goers probably won't like as much as those who gravitate toward the unconventional.  Rather than being driven by plot, this is a character movie, with its strength resting in idiosyncrasies, smart dialogue, and acting.",1087603200,24,1994,4.803519061583578

Culkin does fairly well in his role as a precocious kid who school-hops more often than he change his clothes, hates his quirky family (mother, father, brother all roles played by A-list stars), and eventually goes on the lam.
On the run in the big city, he meets up with various eccentrics: he finds refuge with his godfather's trophy girlfriend, a heroin addict played by Amanda Peet and her arty, bizarre friends. When this relationship sours he finds better solace with Sookie Saperstein (Claire Danes), a bored, ironic college student temporarily on the run from college.
It may be flawed and occasionally embittering. It may be  (intentionally) artsy and ultimately obscure. But this stunning debut is an absolutely watchable treat that I'd recommend in a blink if you care about cinema that evokes thought.",1082246400,3,1068,5.0625

This movie combines this sad wistful spirit with an amazing sarcastic humor.  The Characters are wonderful, the story is amazing, the setting (NYC) is perfect and the soundtrack is perfect.

The obvious comparison would be with ""Catcher in the Rye"" but the action in that is compressed into a short period of time, whereas ""Igby"" has enough backstory and sequel story to fill a mini-series, much less an hour and a half movie! The film is truly exhilarating from the moment Igby jumps out of the limo to escape prep school to the moment he catches his Godfather with his pants down -- I would have liked to have seen the movie concentrate those months and not try so hard to paint a larger canvas. The filmmaker/writer can't resist a clever line or poignant situation until the whole thing collapses in melodrama. It's even untrue to the ""black comedy"" it attempts, backing away from the provocative first scene to make it almost sentimental and giving Igby a very mechanistic explanation for being so difficult.

The worst part is that this should have been good; I wanted it to be a good film, as there's a real lack of stories of this nature. The only saving grace was the performance of Jeff Goldblum, and a few snatches of nice dialogue that are wasted on the end result.

1816023,4,B00007JXWX,"When Igby Goes Down hit theatres last year it disappeared despite its stellar cast and positive reviews.  It's not really a movie to everyone's taste that's true, but this slice of Catcher In The Rye-type teenage angst is never short of compelling.  The story has Igby (Culkin) being kicked out of every school his mother Mimi (Sarandon) places him in, eventually dropping out to experience the boredom, despair and decadence of those around him.
The acting is pitch perfect.  Kieran Culkin makes you honestly believe that he was born to play a role like this, a young man desperate to never conform, terrified that any passion in him will be crushed in the same way his father's (Pullman) spirit was obliterated, eventually landing him in an institution.  Sarandon, as ever, lends the proceedings some class as the rich snobby mother who cares not one jot for her family.  Goldblum plays the confident man surprisingly well considering his past affinity at playing the nervous type in movies such as The Fly.  Ryan Phillipe impresses again in a role in which he's dangerously close to being typecast in - the upper-class snob.  His roles in Gosford Park and Cruel Intentions were great, and it's clear here that he should stick to fare such as this rather than trash like Antitrust.  I'd never seen Amanda Peet in anything before this but she plays her drug-addled character (really a symbol of the very depths of despair, something Igby wishes to experience but doesn't want to overrule him) so well that it can't belong before she becomes a bigger star.  Clare Danes seems to gradually be clawing a comeback with small roles like this and in The Hours.  She's perfect for the role and, importantly, we can see why Igby would be attracted to her charatcer.  A wannabe Bohemian rebel with a quirky personality, she's great value.  It's a cult cast really, filled with actors from cult movies such as The Rocky Horror Picture Show, The Fly and up-and-comers like Culkin and Danes.  Unfortunartely, despite its many qualities, it's doubtful that Igby will ever make it to cult status.  Released too soon over the admitedly far superious Donnie Darko, it's a little bit swamped by its presence as a movie that gained cult status in under a year and it's unlikely that Culkin will have the success that the Gyllenhaal siblings experienced in The Good Girl and Secretary respectively.  However, this is a real gem of a movie that deserves to be viewed and appreciated on its own merits and as such, it's really quite impressive.",1073606400,,2524,4.823665893271461

This movie doesn't simply lack a heart, it doesn't have a head, either. It pretends to be clever and edgy, but it's derivative without even understanding what it's trying to imitate. Try to care about the characters in this film--it's not possible. Don't waste your time with this steaming turd of a movie. Instead, read (or reread) Catcher in the Rye; or watch Rushmore, Tadpole, Harold & Maude, or Donnie Darko. Do situps in a dark room, or just watch bowling on TV while eating some pork rinds.

Susan Sarandon is delightfully sadistic and Jeff Goldblum, who hasn't been terribly busy lately is pitch perfect as D.H. Amanda Peet is a beast, but that was intentional. The only acting that stuck out as majorly sub-par was Ryan Phillippe.

this seems to be the accepted mould for fringe film-making these days - not really comedies, not really dramas - instead occupying some strange cukoo land where families are dysfunctional, sentences are broken and suicide is painless. in other words there is a wilful effort on the part of the film-maker to steer clear of the 'emotion traps' laying in wait for his characters at every turn but does this really reflect our lives? where did the heart go from indie filmmaking.....?",1068595200,4,1024,4.758426966292135

His character is so sad here, rarely appearing, but maintaining a strong presence in Igby's life.  There are at least six memorable characters in ""Igby"", and that's what makes a movie for me.

I was drawn in by two actors being involved: Kieran Culkin, who was great in The Cider House Rules, and Amanda Peet, who shined in Identity. Unfortunately, Culkin--who strikes me as trying to be too much like Tobey Maguire's (a former co-star of Culikn's in Cider House) character from The Ice Storm--is vastly outshone by his little brother Rory. Amanda Peet is thoroughly wasted on a bad role.
On the other hand, Jeff Goldblum does a very good job playing an immoral philandering lawyer. Likewise Ryan Phillippe turned in the surprise performance of the movie as Igby's hopelessly numb and conflicted older brother.

This all-star cast is perfection, but nobody stands out more than young Kieran Culkin, who is proving himself to be the next big-name talent. The scene where he breaks down over his mothers corpse is impossibly poignant and moving... I can't rave enough about this movie.
The humor is dark and understated, but definitely there.  The whole film has this subtle irony to it, especially when it comes to Igby's godfather.

1816107,3,B00007JXWX,"catcher in the rye?
  It has been mentioned that this movie is based on the Catcher in the Rye. Afterall they are both stories that revolve around a disillusioned prep school youth. However, this movie is not a film version of the book. Holden Caulfield's character is desribed foremost by his relationships and his thoughts on the people around him. He manages to find the fleshy side of all of his aquantances, even those who he despises. His commentary is thourough and critical, yet remains sympathetic  . Igby is desribed by his relationships as well, but with these interactions we almost only see his pessimism and sarcasm. His critiques are plentiful, but we never really see him as any more than a young boy carelessly lashing out at a world that is, by his standards, so ""f---ing  hypocritical"".He only seems to care about  others when he is interested in having sex with them. And whereas Holden is a character plagued by paralysis and pensiveness, Igby is  only too willing to sell drugs,run away, get expelled, and sleep with his uncle's mistress. In this way, the movie and book are different, and in this way, the book is far superior.
  cast and acting
  The cast that was assembled for this movie is for the most  part famous. The casting of was very appropriate, and impressive given the film's small budget. The movie is Kieran Culkin's vehichle and he plays the rich boy smartass very well. The rest of the supporting cast are impressive and charismatic, especially jared harris and jeff goldblum. Ryan Phillipe seems to be perfectly  well suited to the WASP character that he has already played in cruel intentions. The movie has some charm and its moments. The conversational sparring between Culkin and Harris in the New York, using a yoga ball as an illustrating prop was  interesting and funny (Money bags... take me away!) . The absurd shrink at ""Clipped Wings"" is a fun comic interlude, and seems to be improvised.

  Part of the fun of the movie is that, although it centers around pretentious people, It doesnt really take itself too seriously. There isn't revelatory. None of the characters change (except for dying) and the message seems to be less than clear. Igby is not a sympathetic character and it is hard to be sympathetic for him.

1816108,3,B00007JXWX,"Igby is a thorougly disagreeable 16-year old with way too much money, surrounded by thoroughly disagreeable parents and caretakers, so it is perhaps understandable that he drops out to live with (and sleep with) his godfather's drug-addict mistress and takes a job delivering drugs for her flamboyantly feminine dealer-boyfriend (a viciously homophobic stereotype who seems to be straight).  The only aspect of the adult society that he approves of is heteronormativity, which is fortunate because every woman in the movie is desperate to engage in statutory rape with him (but they always dump him for older/more powerful men.

1816146,4,B00007JXWX,"'Igby Goes Down' is an unsettling dark comedy about Igby (Kieran Culkin), a young man raised in the cold and hostile environment of the amoral super-rich. The only positive influence in his life is his father (Bill Pullman), a schizophrenic who rebels against the dictatorship of his wealth and his icy wife (played by the excellent Susan Sarandon), only to dissolve into a catatonic state. Taking after dear old dad, Igby makes one attempt after another to break free from his family's clutches and their ironclad expectations of how he should act and who he should be. Enduring military school and near homelessness in New York City, Igby experiences some of the more mundane aspects of a coming-of-age film (love, sex, violence).
But 'Igby Goes Down' is far from a mundane film. Igby is an imperfect hero, not surprisingly because he was raised by the original Ice Maiden. There are elements of this coldness in his own character, which makes it difficult to sympathize completely his plight.
For that matter, there is coldness in all the characters, save Sookie (Clare Danes). Jeff Goldblum is surprisingly perfect as DH Barnes, an indifferent wife-cheating ""friend of the family"" who treats Igby with only the barest of interests. Oliver (Ryan Phillippe) is Igby's perfect older brother, accordingly cold, calculating, and ever-opportunistic. Rachel (Amanda Peet) and Russel (Jared Harris) make up Igby's surrogate family in the City, and despite drug addiction and various dementias, actually seem better suited for Igby than his real family.
This film has been compared to the classic novel, 'The Catcher in the Rye,' and indeed, there are some similarities. Igby is a saner, heartier Holden Caulfield, who survives on wit and a callousness to the savage world around him. A stunning and often funny film, that, like Igby, just seems unable to pull free from icy wit into real brilliance.",1058054400,,1895,5.096463022508039

Even within this target audience, the movie has it's misgivings. The problems with this movie center around the main character Igby, which isn't good.
Kieran Culkin was not a good actor. I could accept him for most of the film, but in the final scenes of emotional release, his feeble acting job didn't quite bring the anguish his character should have been feeling.
Aside from the acting, the film also had some pretty weak dialogue. I get the impression that Igby's jokes were a little too pseudo-intellectual for me, I just didn't get the humour.
Overall, the film comes off as someone's life story, that while honest, wasn't interesting enough, so it got butchered by a screenwriter until plausibility was lost. This still would have made a decent movie if the lead actor could show more believable emotion in the very few scenes that required it.
I think this film is for younger kids who can probably connect more with lonliness and emotional voids in their family relationships. To the rest of us, this film while moderately entertaining, is an average comedy/drama movie in every way.",1056499200,,1396,4.796680497925311

1816150,5,B00007JXWX,"""Igby Goes Down"" is one of the most intelligent and inventive films in recent years and certainly a surprising accomplishment for the typically formulaic American movie industry. As a dark comedy and a social commentary, the genius behind this film ranks it with other notables such as ""Magnolia"", ""Rushmore"", ""American Beauty"", and ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"". While Igby features an all-star cast including Kieran Culkin, Claire Danes, Jeff Goldblum, Amanda Peet, Ryan Phillipe, Bill Pullman, and Susan Sarandon, their celebrity personae are thankfully overshadowed by the quality of the story and its characters. In subsequent interviews that are available on the DVD, many of the actors stated that they were so impressed with the screenplay (written by director Burr Steers) that they were willing to work in a low budget film for a fraction of their normally astronomical wages. As a result, the viewer is rewarded with a kind of performance integrity that is hard to find in normal Hollywood films. The actors really want to act, not simply to be their public selves on screen.
The story begins with two brothers, Oliver (Phillippe), and Igby (Culkin) Slocum suffocating their mother, Mimi (Sarandon) to death. It then backtracks to show us the tortured world of the Slocum family and the strange but radically different paths with which the brothers respond to it. Mimi Slocum is a despotic and dysfunctional mother who is prone to violent fits while her husband Jason (Pullman) is a schizophrenic. From an early age, Oliver internalizes whatever pain and anger he feels toward his family situation and becomes a highly accomplished student, dutiful family member, and a faithful employee. In fact, Oliver evolves into such an intense conformist that the only thing that makes him likable is the sense that on some level his life is a sick parody of itself even if he doesn't fully realize it.
Not so for Igby who contrasts Oliver's stellar behavior by becoming the family's problem child. Kicked out of one private school after another and finally ""on the lam"" as he puts it, Igby plunges into a series of increasingly outrageous situations and delivers some of the wittiest lines of the film. Brilliant, vulnerable, chaotic, and self-destructive, Igby is hardly self-deluded and is certainly no weakling. The fact that Igby is fully aware of who and what he is prevents even the most tragic and difficult parts of this film from being manipulative. Igby never allows himself to hide behind pity, sentimentality or false bravado, and as a result, he prevents the audience from doing this as well. We're stuck with Igby on his crazy ride and we're forced to view the world with his wit and honesty.
Much of the communication in this film is handled with a subtlety that is almost fragile. While Mimi remains a poisonous matriarch from start to finish, she displays incredible moments of humanity with little more than a slight change of expression. Where one might think that with all of his condescension and indifference, Oliver must really hate Igby, this is hardly the case. There is tenderness there, but Oliver has managed to bury it beneath his well-crafted layers of conformity, that he's not about to dismantle as part of some idiotic emotional denouement. And even Igby's suave and sometimes brutal god father D.H. is not as simple as he seems.
For a film of ideas, sarcasm, and gut-wrenching emotion, ""Igby Goes Down"" is an amazingly smooth experience that can be enjoyed on several levels.

That way, you can see Igby the way Steers does, as troubled but brave, and brazen, as a kid jerk trying to keep his head above the fray by his wits and fears.
Because I snuck in the back door, so to speak, I found Igby depressing and his sophiscation juvenile. I was like the shrink in the movie's opening scenes, who smacks Igby upside the head. You can't really like a movie that's this frustrating, can you?

The Holden Caulfield role in this case is filled by Igby (Kieran Culkin), who's been getting bounced from one ritzy school to another for years.  He doesn't want to wind up like his father, who suffered a nervous breakdown from the pressures of his career, but there are some obstacles in his way.  His mother is determined to shape Igby as she sees fit, and his smirky brother Oliver and bloodless godfather D.H. are only too eager to help.  The plot basically consists of Igby avoiding military school, resisting his mother's schemes, and getting close (both emotionally and physically) with his new girlfriend Sookie.  There is a lot to like about ""Igby Goes Down.""  The movie is filled with offbeat and sharply-drawn characters, and the actors invest them all with depth (especially Ryan Phillippe, who seemingly was born to play the role of Oliver).  The dialogue, as in many indie movies, is witty and realistic, and the relationship between Igby and Sookie gives the movie some much-needed tenderness.  And while the theme of the young nonconformist trying to find his own way has been repeated numerous times in the past half-century or so, it's still worth repeating.  If ""Igby Goes Down"" suffers from anything, it's that it's a bit too ""Indie.""  It's hard to explain, but the movie has a somewhat self-congratulatory air about it, as if it holds the key to the meaning of life and viewers should be glad that they're getting to witness such an important film.  In other words, ""Igby Goes Down"" comes pretty close to succumbing to its own hipness.  However, the movie still manages to succeed, thanks largely to its good humor and winning cast.  Hell, it's better than much of what passes for entertainment these days.",1050278400,6,2134,4.905292479108635
1816176,4,B00007JXWX,"""Igby Goes Down"" is one of those small, acerbic black comedies that some people find pointless and others love to the point of turning it into a cult classic.  I would have to lean toward the latter category.
Igby, honestly realized by Kieran Culkin, is an angry, aimless teenager rebelling against the cold, loveless world of his well-to-do but ultimately miserable parents (Susan Sarandon and Bill Pullman) and extremely wealthy godfather, D.H. (Jeff Goldblum, in a particularly good role).  The focus of the movie is his quest to find a place where he belongs, while his schizophrenic father wastes away in an institution and his cruel mother dies of breast cancer.
None of the characters in ""Igby Goes Down"" are very likeable, but they're REAL.  Culkin does a wonderful job of conveying Igby's lost, angry restlessness, Susan Sarandon is wonderfully hateable as mother Mimi, and Amanda Peet is particularly poignant as Rachel, ""a dancer who doesn't dance"" whose friend is a ""painter who doesn't paint"", and who is having an affair with Igby's godfather D.H.  There is a lot of rather unpleasant honesty in the lives of these miserable, screwed-up people, and writer-director Burr Steers succeeds admirably at peeling away the layers of unhappiness.  And in the midst of pain, this movie is brutally, bizarrely FUNNY.",1050105600,,1320,5.092592592592593
1816177,3,B00007JXWX,"A sarcastic, cynical, and at times psychologically brutal little movie that doesn't have one likable character to speak of. But the movie eventually grows on you, and all the good performances (esp. by Susan Sarandon & Jeff Goldblum) help flesh out the viciousness.  Sarandon, in particular should've won an Oscar (or hell, at least been nominated!) for her edgy role here.  She's perfect.  Ryan Phillippe though is out of his league here, barely realizing his character in an awkward performance.  The movie shocked me with it's oh-so-dark narrative, but it's is well done film-making, even if it falters a bit with it's balance of dark comedy and heavy handed breakdowns.",1049068800,2,673,5.090909090909091
1816178,3,B00007JXWX,"***1/2 Matricide, euthanasia, terminal cancer, alcoholism, drug addiction, adultery, attempted suicide - these are just a handful of the elements that comprise Burr Steers' latest ""comedy"" entitled ""Igby Goes Down.""  Steers, who both wrote and directed the film, steers a clear course between comedy and tragedy, never allowing one element to dominate over or obliterate the other.  In a courageous move, he has provided both an unconventional plot and a cast of characters who are not always easily likeable, but whom we come to like nevertheless.  He is aided immeasurably by a sterling cast consisting of such acting heavyweights as Susan Sarandon, Jeff Goldblum, Amanda Peet, Ryan Phillippe, Bill Pullman, Claire Danes, and Kieran and Rory Culkin, who play the title character at different stages of his life.
Steers' point seems to be that a world full of neurotic, self-absorbed and dysfunctional adults will lead to a world full of neurotic, self-absorbed and dysfunctional children - all caught in a cycle that will never end until some new generation steps in to stop it.  Igby, a senior in high school, is fast on his way to becoming a lost soul.  Though members of the upper class Manhattan elite, Igby's parents have failed to provide Igby with the kind of paternal support a child needs to flourish and grow.  He must endure a father whose response to the pressures of life has been to seek surcease in an emotional breakdown; a mother whose rampant drug addiction, domineering personality and general coldness have driven a wedge between her and her children; and a brother who, in some odd way, seems to love Igby, but who is more than willing to play by the rules to get to the top of the heap in the corporate world, a goal Igby soundly rejects as meaningless and empty.  Igby also has a godfather who seems more concerned with bagging a young mistress for himself than in providing the wayward boy with any real direction or guidance.  Add to the mix, two young women who are just as [messed] up and rudderless as Igby and you have a recipe for real disaster.  Yet, despite the fact that Igby indulges in a lot of rather despicable behavior throughout the course of the film, we get the sense that there is some core of value buried deep within his being that will ultimately allow him to disconnect from and triumph over the people and circumstances that seem to be conspiring to bring him down.
Despite the fact that the movie is touted as a dark ""comedy,"" the film ends up actually being more poignant than funny thanks to fine performances by Susan Sarandon, Clair Danes (who has dropped most of the annoying mannerisms that blighted some of her earlier film work and here has learned how to relax and go with the flow), and, above all, Kieran Culkin, who holds the center of the picture in his own youthful hands.  Through Culkin's performance, we get the sense that Igby, though lost and confused, is a pretty sharp guy and knows enough to reject the false values that the people in his life are trying to instill in him.  Although he is not above treating people with a certain amount of disrespect or doing what he knows may be wrong and hurtful, he also seems able to cut through the class-conscious phoniness and see life as it really is, which puts us on his side right from the beginning.  We sense at the end that he has come to some understanding of his own imperfections and will endeavor to make something of himself once he has cut the tie that binds him to this wholly dysfunctional world.
""Igby Goes Down"" isn't a film that provides a tremendous number of laughs and you may find yourself put off by much of what you see on screen.  But the film's genuinely anarchic tone and spirit, along with the many fine performances, go a long way towards mitigating its few undeniable weaknesses.",1048982400,5,3823,4.688059701492537

Igby fights with all of his might to free himself from it.  Neither one of the brothers is entirely winning their battle.  Mi Mi their mother is cold and superficial.

1816181,4,B00007JXWX,"""Igby Goes Down"", in the tradition of many ""teenage boy coming of age"" movie, bearing fair comparison to ""The Graduate"" and ""Catcher in the Rye"", with moments of the blackest comedy thrown in. It is an enjoyable film, mainly for the sharpness of the performances, as well as an equally sharp script that leaves no stone unturned, nor protects anyone.
It's the story of ""Igby"", so aptly nicknamed, as you will discover, whom cannot seem to get his feet firmly planted in his life. Yes, we've seen this story a thousand times, and a thousand times more. He wanders through his life, questioning everything, and everyone, under the sun; his pill-popping mother, distant brother, suspicious godfather and his trampy girlfriend, and even an odd love interest who is bitter yet reachable.
Fearing falling into the cliche trap, the script bops all over the place, making for some wonderfully surprising moments. Gore Vidal as a priest! Cynthia Nixon as a [substance] abusing former teacher! Were it not so believable, you'd be spending time waiting for the next celeb cameo. However, the strength of the writing is absurdly clear, both realistic and character illuminating.
Secondly, the performances stun and wonder. Kieran Culkin carries the film, making his angst believable but not overdramatic. Susan Sarandon can do no wrong, and makes the mother believable but not overdramatic. Ryan Phillipe irritates appropriately, Amanda Peet flutters through the film, and Claire Danes shines. Hook a film with a strong script and performances and you have a winner.
My only worries: we've seen the angst-ridden teenager before. It seems the beginning of the film flounders a bit as Igby flounders. It was distracting, but perhaps purposefully so. I found myself fighting to get into the movie, to even care about Igby, which I so wanted to do. He eventually comes around, and you do care, but it was like climbing walls.
Cheers to the filmmaker for this gutsy script, and cheers to Igby, hopefully by the end of the film, finding himself amongst the angst.",1048291200,3,2045,5.035398230088496
1816182,5,B00007JXWX,"It will be said repeatedly that this film or piece of literature is remniscent of the story of Salinger's rebellious Holden Caufield; in this case, however, it is true.  If literary fans will recall what made Holden so popular, it was his uncommon nature, which took the form of depression/failure/complexities; contrary to popular belief, it was not, in fact, the depression/failure/complexities.  The same can be applied to Igby--what makes him so wonderful is not solely the depression or the failure or the complexities, because every other movie has a main character who posesses all of those traits.  What makes Igby, and his story, so fascinating is the unusual circumstances his life takes place in.  I fell into a mixture of love and disgust when I saw this film--it's a feeling that you never tire of.",1047772800,,811,4.985185185185185

It's that kind of movie and it's brilliant.  Like a barb-wire version of RUSHMORE.  The performances are exquisite, with Susan Sarandon and especially the under-rated Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman making their characters as palpable as a slap in the face.",1047168000,,515,5.107142857142857
1816193,5,B00007JXWX,"Not every movie starts with a pair of teenage boys painstakingly killing their mother, and even fewer could make you like those boys. But ""Igby Goes Down"" actually manages to do this. It's a coming-of-age story (much as I hate the phrase) with humor and poignancy, and it's a hard role that the fantastic Kieran Culkin pulls off.
Igby's father (Bill Pullman) is in a mental home, his mother Mimi (Susan Sarandon) is a pill-popping harpy, his godfather D.H. (Jeff Goldblum) is humorously scruple-free, and his brother Oliver (Ryan Phillippe) is cold-blooded and mercenary. Igby himself (Kieran Culkin) is a perpetual dropout who deliberately fails at every prep school he's sent to, and then he runs away from a cab taking him back to military school. Free at last of his suffocating upper-crust life, Igby secretly moves into the loft apartment of D.H.'s dancer-junkie mistress Rachel (Amanda Peet).
At first, things are okay for Igby, especially after he meets and falls for a cynical, ice-cream-eating college student named Sookie Sapperstein (Claire Danes). But when his brother disrupts his love life, his godfather finds out about Igby's relationship with Rachel, and Mimi's cancer grows worse, Igby begins to go down... unless he can break away to freedom.
One of the most unique aspects of ""Igby Goes Down"" is that a concrete reason is given for the lead character to rebel. Most rebels don't have a cause. But Igby rebels not just out of unhappiness, but out of fear that he (like his father) will ""go down."" One of the most moving parts of this film is when a young Igby (played by Kieran's little brother Rory) sees his father come unglued in the shower. An equally memorable scene has Igby hollowly repeating his father's words at his own reflection.
The humor is mainly of the weirder sort, like half the people in the cast punching Igby (even his SHRINK!), Mimi sitting on the maid's head, or the disgruntled drag queen (""Lucky... CHARMS!""). The dialogue is witty and full of little quotable insults. Kids probably shouldn't see this movie -- there's nudity, a couple of bedroom scenes, cursing and a few scenes involving suicide.
Kieran Culkin is brilliant in this film, which has garnered some of the recognition he deserves. Susan Sarandon seems to revel in her role as the mother-from-hell, and while I didn't like Ryan Phillippe in ""Gosford Park,"" his cold acting fits the role of Oliver. Goldblum seems to be revelling just as much as Sarandon as Oliver's future self; Claire Danes, when she doesn't cry, is fantastic as the wannabe-cynic Sookie, who is obviously just as confused as Igby.
""Igby Goes Down"" is worth watching, if nothing else, because of Culkin's fantastic acting. But it's also witty, sad, weird, and quite well-written. One of the best indie films of 2002 -- and that's saying a lot.",1046304000,47,2820,4.901673640167364

The thing i really enjoyed about it was that unlike most movies these that have that everyone lives happily ever after ending, Igby Goes Down ends on with such realism and poignancy that you have to love it. The charisma of the actors and particularly Kieran Culkin as Igby is fascinating and endearing. And with fantasic wit and sarcasm the story of Igby is told with a straightforwardness and honesty that is scarce in most movies. It's an endearing piece, and i wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who needs something to perk up their day and lift their spirits.",1045958400,,732,4.638461538461539
1816195,5,B00007JXWX,"""Igby Goes Down"" was easily one of the best films from 2002. It storyline is perhaps not all that original: young, spoiled rich kid with family problems flees them by running off to the city to live in ""a boho version of the Island of Lost Toys"". But he winds up having to go home again to truly find himself. The End.
But there is much more to this film than that. First, there is unusual cinematography and great editing. There is a thumping, evocative soundtrack. But most of all there are great performances. Kieran Culkin officially gets my Most Underrated Actor of the Year award for this one. (While we're at it, let's award him the Most Talented Culkin Brother, By a Mile award as well.) For someone with comparatively little film experience, he holds his own and even steals some scenes from heavyweights like Susan Sarandon and Jeff Goldblum. Ryan Philippe should continue to play the stuck-up young Republican for the rest of his onscreen career--he has finally found a character that is suited to his wooden, deadpan style of acting. And Amanda Peet...well, who knew she could act? Maybe she, too, has found the character she should stick with from now on, but it seems to be more than that. I actually found the scene where she is covering her track marks to be one of the most emotionally affecting in the whole film.
There has been criticism that this movie is too unfeeling and dark for its own good, and that its emotional punch is lost in a mire of sarcasm. However, I fail to see how anyone could watch the heartbreaking scene between the young Igby and his father in the bathroom, when his father has his final breakdown, and accuse this film of having no emotional impact. It has also been said that the film rips off ""Catcher in the Rye"" but makes the hero an overprivileged brat. ""Catcher in the Rye"" was a great book, but it dealt with a class of people famous for overdramatizing their problems: teenagers. Holden's main complaint was that he just didn't fit in, which is a legitimate but somewhat immature motivation for all that follows in the book. Igby's character is just the same way: the film does not ask us to sympathize unconditionally with everything Igby does, and we are aware that many of his ""problems"" aren't really problems at all but are just things he will outgrow as he gets older. One can't blame Igby for being overly dramatic when be belongs to a social class that is constantly told they have no right to have problems.
This is not a feel-good film. There are some scenes that are a little weird, and the humor is not for everyone. But if you try and look at the protagonist as a kid not unlike yourself at his age, and root for him to outgrow his problems, the film can be quite affecting. It is a lucky person indeed who hasn't had a moment of utter despair like Igby has when Sookie tells him she won't go to California with him. Those moments force us to become adults, though, and I left this film thinking that in a few years, Igby was going to be just fine.",1045785600,,3013,4.48
1816196,5,B00007JXWX,"""Igby Goes Down"" is a dark comedy which echoes the best of the anti-establishment movies which thrived in America from the late 1960s through the 1970s. Some critics have compared it to ""The Graduate"", although the similarities escape me. Kieran Culkin may well be the next Dustin Hoffman, but the character he plays is someone I doubt that Benjamin Braddock, protagonist of ""The Graduate"", would have either understood or associated with. In tone and spirit, the movie reminds me personally of 1971's brilliant ""Harold and Maude"" [available on VHS and DVD]. Both films are acerbic and nihilistic on the surface, yet ultimately allow the main character to escape the harsh, utterly materialistic world into which he is born.
Igby [Culkin] lives in a world where social position and material possessions act as poor substitutes for love and affection. His father [Bill Pullman] is in a mental institution, perhaps driven there by his cold, shrewish mother [Susan Sarandon]. His brother [Ryan Phillippe] has adapted quite nicely to his environment and is headed for the top. Igby, though, is a tortured soul. At seventeen, he sees through the lies and deception which surround him and makes no effort to fit in. As in most dysfunction families, denial rules, and Igby is made out to be the problem. We watch, sometimes amused and sometimes horrified, as Igby plots to escape. Being a product of his environment, he is anything but a nice guy most of the time, yet we sense that there is much in him that is salvageable.
Culkin appeared in two of 2002's best independent films, ""The Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys"" and this one. He is a wonderful young actor, sort of a cross between Robert Downey Jr., and Tobey Macguire. Besides Sarandon, Pullman and Phillippe, the first-rate supporting cast includes Jeff Goldblum, Amanda Peet and Clare Danes.
While ""Igby Goes Down"" does not always succeed, due to some rough-around-the-edges script elements, it is a fascinating portrait of a young man caught in a web of diabolical materialism. Highly recommended for those who appreciate some of the ironies of American life.",1045353600,3,2112,5.01994301994302
1816197,5,B00007JXWX,"There's nothing new under the sun. This is a theme that's been tackled before but not quite so well. What makes this movie work is the performances--most notably by Kieran Culkin (and, as his younger self, by real-life younger brother Rory Culkin. (Is there a limitless supply of gifted Culkins?) With Bill Pullman offering a harrowing, entirely believable portrait of mental illness as Igby's father, and Susan Sarandon (who gives, sadly, the least believable performance in the film) as the pill-popping, relentless and utterly loathsome mother; with Ryan Philippe doing a convincing job as a driven, upwardly-mobile older brother, Igby doesn't stand a chance. Betrayal on all sides is the hallmark of his life and it's a testament to the character's intelligence and powerful life force that he doesn't crumble under the multiple assaults on his sensibilities. Igby lives in hope--something necessary to survival--and we hope along with him.
There are some hilarious scenes and some that are positively shocking in their unexpected brutality. Jeff Goldblum is flawless as Igby's super-rich godfather--helpful and seemingly feckless at moments only, at other moments, to reveal a cruelty stunning in its efficiency. Clare Danes (who, one must hope, will be around for decades to reveal more and more of her depthless talent) is lovely as Sookie--a layered, thoughtful performance with great substance. And Amanda Peet is like a live wire on wet pavement as Goldblum's girl-on-the-side.
Don't miss this. It offers a genuine insight into the mind of a bright, troubled (not without cause) young man and his innate resourcefulness in seeking something better and finer for his future.

1816199,4,B00007JXWX,"Igby Goes Down sports a fantastic cast, but its lead, Kieran Culkin, steals the show as a 17-year-old with no ambition in life.
Using a great combination of music and visual cues, Igby Goes Down captures the confusion of Igby, a social and family outcast kicked out of school after school. Though many of his situations are bleak, the film is never heavy in despair. Rather, it maintains a refreshingly upbeat rhythm as the spoiled Igby tries to find his lot in life. It's similar in theme to The Graduate, but with a more charming atmosphere. Igby's listless in life, but he's trying to appear that he enjoys it more then Dustin Hoffman's character did in the 1960s film.
Culkin shows that he has the staying power to becoming a great actor. He convincingly portrays a wide range of emotions, including the hard to achieve apathy that Igby shows the world. He even manages to outshine his co-stars, who include Susan Sarandan, Jeff Goldblum, Ryan Phillippe and Claire Danes. The accompanying soundtrack hits all the right notes, blending in perfectly with the visuals while avoiding clichd, obvious scenes.
Igby Goes Down is a splendid twist in the coming-of-age genre, with plenty of black humor, fantastic acting and great music to keep you going back for more. This one is highly recommended.",1045008000,,1296,4.868778280542986

This unfortunately seems to be the case with one of the best film releases of 2002, ""Igby Goes Down"".This pitch black comedy basically channels the spirit and the atmosphere of J.D. Salinger's classic ""Catcher in the Rye"" for the new millenium. In this case the 'poor little rich boy' is a smart mouthed, seventeen year old named Igby (well played by Kieran Culkin), who is on his way to being kicked out of every good private/parochial school on the East Coast. The source of Igby's rebellion is his wealthy, dysfunctional family, that includes a tyrannical, pill popping mother (suberbly played by Susan Sarandon), a cold, yuppie, older brother (Ryan Phillippe) and a mentally unbalanced, institutionalized father (Bill Pullman). To top it all off, he has an advice spewing Godfather (Jeff Goldblum in one of his best roles ever), who has a hidden vicious streak. Igby decides he has had enough of school and goes on the lam (in a pricey rehabbed loft) in New York City. It is here that he meets a variety of colorful, NYC residents (artists, junkies, drag queens etc.) as he tries to survive in the concrete jungle. Eventually Igby must come to terms with his family and it's past. Did I mention this was a comedy? This is a film that has both pathos and a very dark sense of humor, that will have you laughing thoughout. Writer/Director, Burr Steers has crafted a comical script that is both witty and literate. The conversations of these characters are infinitely interesting to listen to. This is also a film in which the casting is perfection. All the actors in this ensemble cast are performing at the top of their craft. The performances are funny, yet full of nuance. As mentioned before, both actors Susan Sarandon and Jeff Goldblum, put in excellent performances as some rather nasty characters. A special mention should also be made for actress, Claire Danes, who is very good as Sookie, a pseudo-bohemian college student (on break of course), who just might be Igby's only friend. The DVD to this movie is both crisp and clear. Extras include a Director's commentary track, a movie trailer, a featurette with actor interviews and a wonderful compilation of deleted scenes.

Igby throws together a bunch of unlikable characters and tries to get you to care about them.  But it's all too smug to draw you in.  The film is also a complete mess, jumping forward and backward in time abruptly, and never lingering in one place long enough for you to make a connection with any of the characters.

Of, course, the real credit goes to Mr Steers, who has created a Holden Caulfield for the new millenium. I cannot praise this work of art enough!-- Nicky Silver",1044576000,,469,5.171052631578948
1816226,5,B00007JXWX,"Igby Goes Down is a film about a lost youth, who fights with his perscription drug addicted mother(Susan Surandon), leaves or is expelled from all forms of school and ends up living on the lamb from family in an apartment in Manhattan with heroin addicted dancer who doesn't dance(Amanda Peet).  He falls for a girl who is the picture of a Boheimian(Claire Danes) and is ultamately left hartbroken when she leaves him for his older, better looking, but remarkably colder older brother(Ryan Phillippe).  This is a bare summary that sets the story, but shows you none of the profound truth and emotion that the film portreys.  Kieren Culkin is Igby, but he could easily be a young Robert Downey Jr.  You truely get a first glimps of an astonishing young actor.
Igby is not his real name but it is so fitting for such an original character.  Igby Goes Down is full of sophistocated and complex characters.  But they are all manage to be very different.  Films released recently that claim to draw an accurate portrate of the youth experience in today's society such as The Rules Of Attraction, are full of the same characters appearing in both sexes and all sexualities.  It is rare that a film can make characters relationships seem real if the characters are not similar.  Igby is the exception.  The film repeats no characters and all relationships seem realer for it.  The longest friendships in real life are not based on common interests, interests change.  Real relationships are built on differences.  For example the reason you fight so much with your mother is because you are so alike.  This is true of Igby's relationship with his mother, and the differences between himself and the others around him is what keeps the film and the relationships interesting.
No one should miss this truely brilliant, amazing, funny, and charming movie.",1044489600,,1845,4.853035143769968

Put away the Kleenex, do something you enjoy and make this world a better place. However, if feeling sorry for yourself is your thing-this is your movie.

Kieran Culkin plays Igby, a spoiled rich kid who has nothing better to do than whine and complain about how stupid life is.  He is a wannabe Holden Caulfield.  But while Holden was intelligent and likeable, Igby is just down right annoying.  Along the way he meets characters who are so pretentious by trying to be weird and strange.
I really wanted to like this movie.  The title is very interesting and the cast made me want to see it.  But I must tell you that I wanted to walk out of this movie thirty minutes into it.  It is so horrible.  Ryan Philipe is flat as the older brother and Susan Sarandon's talents are simply wasted.  A terrible, terrible film.",1044144000,2,735,4.385185185185185
1816229,5,B00007JXWX,"In the history of film teen angst films are a relatively recent genre.  The first classic teen film, in fact, might be REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE.  There have been a few additional good teen films, but most of them, by and large, haven't been terribly successful.  IGBY GOES DOWN is a spectacular exception, and takes its place as one of the finest teen films ever made.  Although it has many exceptionally sad, even tragic elements, it is nonetheless a comedy.  But even at its sharpest moments, the comedy is very, very dark.  At one point Claire Danes says to Kieran Culkin, ""You're funny"" and he replies, ""Then why don't you laugh?""  This could be emblematic for the film as a whole.
The movie begins with Culkin and Ryan Phillippe, playing sons of Susan Sarandon, placing a plastic bag over her head to kill her.  It sets the tone for the rest of the film as effectively as any I have ever seen.  Moving on from there, we are introduced to all the various broken individuals who inhabit Igby's world:  His horrific, unaffectionate, hyper critical, coldhearted mother, played magnificently by Susan Sarandon.  His loving father played by Bill Pullman, who nonetheless succumbs to mental illness and is institutionalized.  His amoral, cold brother.  His philandering godfather played by Jeff Goldblum.  Goldblum's mistress, a heroin addict played by Amanda Peet.  For a while, he apparently has a decent girlfriend, played by Claire Danes, but she ends up hurting him as much as any of the others.  It is indicative of how wretched his world is when perhaps his greatest benefactors in the film are the heroin addict and her drug supplier.
Igby is no saint, but by the end of the film, you end up thinking that, given his execrable upbringing and acquaintances, he has turned out far better than one might have hoped.  Kieran Culkin does a first rate job as the quick witted, verbally clever, emotionally messed up Igby.  In fact, just about everyone in the film excels in their role.  The true star of the film however, is first-time director/screenwriter Burr Steers.  His direction is excellent, but the screenplay is nothing less than stunning.
This film has received a great deal of critical attention, but it hasn't received the kind of general attention that it deserves.  I believe that over time more and more people will discover this film.  It is far too good to become forgotten.  Eventually, it should establish a significant base of fans, and could possible become a great teen cult film.  If not, it still is a phenomenal film that deserves as many viewers as it can get.",1043884800,38,2584,4.794117647058823
1816230,2,B00007JXWX,"I never write reviews on this site and I am reticent to trash anything, but I am bothered because this film purports to be a filmed version of ""The Catcher in the Rye"" (Salinger would never sell the rights, especially if he read this script, thus the name change).  I truly believe this film gets it all wrong and that Salinger's view of the world wasn't this cynical and dehumanizing.
Burr Steers' faux-intelligent translation to film is a pretentious mess with characters of no redeeming value. The humor is forced and tired and the performances are all over-the-top, a style of acting which is all too easy for any decent actor to pull off.
I hated sitting through this movie because I really indentified with Salinger's book when I was younger.  Once I realized that that was what this film was trying to emulate, I got angry.  Salinger's novel wasn't nearly this pessimistic.
That said, the soundtrack is decent so, for that, I'll give it two stars. If you must buy this movie, please ignore the dialogue and listen to the music.
This is why some actors shouldn't be given a camera.",1043107200,5,1087,4.651041666666667

1816244,3,B00007JXWX,"This movie was rolling along with irreverent comedic grace until it threw its playing cards in the air leaving Igby, the privileged, juvenile anti-hero, left to confidently fend for himself in a world that will surely eat him alive. Going down I suppose. In an attempt to fuse some moral substance into this misguided teen, the pat climax concerning a death bed emotional outbreak seemed forced upon the script and cruel. Too bad the movie weakens because I liked the drug addicted, money-grubbing Igby but are we to undertand his freedom and redemption is won only through the circumstances of the morbid death scene and a character whimpering in a mental institution? Kieran Culkin is amazing in the title role bringing believability to a character possessing a lashing intellectual wit who apparently never read a book in his life. Unfortunately Ryan Phillippe couldn't have been any less interesting as his preppie older brother and Claire Danes as a love interest seemed bursting at the seam with something just verging on acting ability. I guess you have to be really fond of Igby, I mean really fond, to see his character emerge as anything but a future fatality.",1037318400,2,1170,4.944162436548224
1816245,5,B00007JXWX,"""Igby Goes Down,"" written and directed by Burr Steers, stars Kieran Culkin as the curiously named title character (the disturbing story behind this unusual name is revealed during the course of the film). Igby is a troubled youth who has been expelled from several schools and is in constant conflict with his overbearing mother, Mimi (played by Susan Sarandon). The film explores Igby's interconnected relationships with his circle of family and friends in and around New York City as he gropes his way towards young adulthood.
This is a quirky story that is well acted by a stellar cast. Sarandon is a true force of nature as a mother-from-hell (who at one point is compared to Medea). Superb performances are also turned in by Jeff Goldblum (as Igby's rich, sleazy godfather), Ryan Phillipe (as Igby's annoyingly perfect golden-boy older brother), Claire Danes (as a friend of Igby's), and Rory Culkin (as the younger Igby seen in flashbacks). But the film is really Kieran Culkin's, and he is outstanding. He brings to life all aspects of this complicated character, from his ironic world-weariness to visceral pain.
""Igby"" contains some clever dialogue and features some great chemistry among the cast. Often funny, the film also has some really painful, harrowing scenes. Overall, it's a solid coming-of-age story that, I believe, well demonstrates Kieran Culkin's ability as a cinematic leading man.",1034726400,10,1406,5.171052631578948
1816246,1,B00007JXWX,"There is rule in formal debate, that is a basic element of storytelling: no new information in the conclusion. Another rule is ""show me, don't tell me."" This movie is the antithesis of these rules. All I hear from the dialogue is new information. It did not build any suspense because I either knew what they were going to tell me or I didn't care. Not to mention it left a lot out.
Why would Rachel (Amanda Peet) suddenly assault Igby, pin him down to the bed and have her way with him? Those crazy artists and their heroin. Why would Sookie (Claire Danes) sleep with Oliver (Ryan Phillipe) at all, other than he is her own age? Why would D.H. (Jeff Goldblum) beat the daylights out of Igby for reporting Rachel's OD? We are told that he was just doing business. That is the crux that this movie revolves around: we are told that this is so. ... Maybe something happened at the end of the movie that explained why the movie was all talk, no action and absolutely no plot, but I doubt it.
They should have done ""Catcher In the Rye"" with the same actors, save one.
Amanda Peet should be banned from movies for eternity. What kind of hold does she have on the industry? ... They should sick the Homeland Security after her and lock her up with John Walker Lindhm,...stop censorship...and free Mumia.",1034640000,,1297,4.430962343096234
1816247,2,B00007JXWX,"This is the sort of art house film that distinguishes itself by being more self consciously hip, cynical and caustic than any mainstream Hollywood film would dare to be. If this impresses you, you will think Igby Goes Down is one of the most brilliant movies of recent years. If, however, you demand plausible characters and story lines in your movies, you might be disappointed, as I was. I suppose Kieran Culkin gives a good performance in portraying the precociously world weary Igby. Susan Sarandon, likewise, ably plays Igby's detestable socialite mother. Igby has a smugly suave older brother who is almost more unlikable than Igby himself; Igby's father has had a psychotic breakdown. The fact that virtually all of the characters in this film are unsympathetic is not necessarily a flaw. However, I found their interactions lacking in any substantial qualities, including humor. Again, if you find it intrinsically funny to watch characters constantly one-up each other with high brow, sarcastic put-downs, then Igy will have you rolling on the floor. I found these exchanges rather tedious after the first fifteen minutes. Igby Goes Down portrays a New York City only experienced by the wealthy. Despite the fact that Igby is supposed to be roughing it (he's run away from military school) in a downtown artist's loft, he doesn't appear to ever inhabit the real city. There is a spaciousness to all the scenes that is very rarely felt in the real Manhattan. For example,when Igby is with a new girlfriend in Central Park, they seem to have the whole park to themselves. Other scenes show characters on rooftops looking down at the city. This would not be bad if the point was to portray upper class life, but it works against the film's pseudo-bohemian spirit. Despite all his supposed angst, Igby always seems like a sheltered rich kid. The central problem I had with Igby Goes Down is that it is ultimately more about Igby's ascerbic wisecracks than about the pain we are supposed to believe his persona covers.",1034553600,13,2022,4.932551319648094
1816248,5,B00007JXWX,"Igby Slocum (Kieran Culkin) is a smart-mouthed, obnoxious, spoiled brat rich kid whose only saving grace is his intelligence and his, what Ill call, negative charm and good looks. He hates his over-bearing mother, Mimi (Susan Sarandon) and brother Ollie (Ryan Phillipe) but seems to genuinely love his mental hospital patient father (Bill Pullman) mostly I think because his dad is a lost soul unable to cope with his life, however privileged it is. Dad ultimately lands in a mental institution when he irrevocably breaks with reality in a brilliant, harrowing scene witnessed by Igby as a small child.
In many ways, Igby is also a lost soul and he obviously recognizes his father in himself when he says, and Im paraphrasing here: Im just waiting to go crazy, also.
Burr Steers the director of Igby had a tough road to hoe as it were, in developing this story in that his hero has to be ultimately sympathetic if we are going to care at all about him or the movie hes in. Steers is not remaking Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer after all, even though so much about Igby and his behavior is negative, bratty stuff.
So, what makes Igby run? Some of this back-story is cleverly and swiftly revealed during the films title sequence. Smart and Witty. Also, Igbys scenes with his Mom are very well written and reveal much about Igbys place in the family Slocum. Susan Sarandon as Mimi is on the other side of the world, character-wise from her role in The Banger Sisters. Here she is the ultimate NYC Upper Eastside Wasp Matron dripping with superiority and condescension while Bill Pullman is heartbreaking as her weak husband and Igbys Dad.
Among the supporting roles, it is great to see that Clare Danes has survived the debacle of The Mod Squad with all her luminous qualities intact. But ultimately the movie can only succeed or fail based on the strength or weakness of the actor playing Igby. Kieran Culkin does a superb job of balancing Igbys obnoxious traits with his basic humanity and caring. Culkins Igby is, in the balance, more sinned against than sinning. Theres a real and palpable intelligence emanating from Culkin that cannot be faked. Watch him as he listenscheck out his eyes and more importantly what he is projecting from beneath his eyes.
Igby Goes Down is the blackest of black comedies with definite references to 50s style melodrama. Igby is what The Royal Tenenbaums aspired to be: a witty, sharp, brilliantly written dissection of a particular family at a particular time in its very specific life.",1034294400,14,2524,4.778032036613272

1816250,3,B00007JXWX,"The acting in this movie is very good, particularly Susan Sarandon as the just barely holding it together mother, and excepting Ryan Phillippe, who plays Igby's Republican brother as an emotionally dead automaton, but without the quiet emotional resonance that Kieran Culkin manages to suggest for his character.
  However, this seems to be a case where the writer should not also have been the director, because while the script had some good moments, it was not nearly as clever as it thought it was, but an innovative director might have made something of it. Instead, Burr takes cliches and stereotypes, and instead of playing with them, as you think at first he will, he seems to be entirely serious about them. For instance, are we really supposed to take seriously a romantic relationship between a 16ish boy and a college woman? (Particulary silly is the sex sceene, precipitated by the boy being beat up and the woman wiping the blood from his face. To make it worse, Burr makes the--thankfully brief--sex scene begin with a long, long sweep across the floor, pausing on each bit of the the discarded clothing. This camera sweep distracted me so much from the mood of the movie that I found myself consciously hoping that this was some sort of parody, that the end of the camera sweep would not find the two in bed, but of course it does.)
  The movie comes across as the fantasy of a teenage boy who thinks he is more interesting and important than he is, which would be fine if the movie were commenting on that fantasy in some interesting way, but instead Burr seems to be participating in it.",1033603200,3,1605,4.680851063829787
