As a result, any practitioner, regardless of style, even weapon-based like me as a long time Silat practitioner; would benefit TREMENDOUSLY from these DVDs.

They are simply highly recommended for any practitioner seeking for good self-defense against knife attacks.",1483056000,,468,5.3108108108108105

8187023,5,B000OWNJ5W,"James Keating is a recognized expert in knife techniques and tactics.  As a lifetime student of the martial arts, I have always maintained that in order to be able to defend against a weapon, one should have experience using that weapon.  Keating shows numerous effective defenses when unarmed against someone armed with a weapon.  Many of the principles are the same whether the weapon is a knife, club or gun. For example, if you cannot stay out of range of a weapon, the best place to be is inside the weapon holders body, so he/she cannot use that weapon against you.

Keating understands just how dangerous a weapon can be in a skilled person's hands, and he shows techniques and tactics that are for the most part simple and effective.  In fact, I have taught many of the techniques against a knife that he shows in this DVD.

 In conclusion, this DVD is for anyone who is seeking a simple and effective method to counter a weapon attack.
