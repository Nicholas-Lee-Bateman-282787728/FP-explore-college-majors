8088790,1,B000BM7Z4G,I understand that during this modern day resetion this movie is right on time I also have full respect and appreciate for the independant film circuit some the best and most revealing films have come from that format. But this movie was so bad I wonder how it got made I feel that the makers of this film dug down so deep to show you the pain and life changing losing your job can be that they forgot about artistry and presenting it became overacted overstated with no solutions or examples of survival after a set back just plan dispair.,1284076800,,539,4.4
8088791,3,B000BM7Z4G,"The movie shows that it was made extremely cheaply. I saw this film at a film festival about 5 years ago. I liked the storyline, but you have to deal with a slew of production problems most of which the average american is not ready for. At the festival, I met the director and he said that he was the only person behind the scenes doing everything from getting lunch to the lighting to the cinematography. The project shows the lack of help especially in the audio department. Many times you have to turn up the volume just to hear the actors, then you have to deal with the hum of the airconditioning and everything else just to understand it. For a one-person show to get made and distributed speaks volumes, however the overall movie is lacking.

I can't say it's a perfect movie, because it's not, and whomever decides to rent/buy will have to deal with lots production problems. But for a movie made for less than $10,000 and as a first attempt in filmmaking, I don't think it's that bad. It even went on to win the film festival!",1260921600,,1036,4.424083769633508

I hear that pain and affirm that there is an audience willing to see a quality film on that subject.  But this film and the word quality shouldn't even be said in the same sentence!
This film was full of bad acting.  The actors seemed like they were reading their lines off of cue cards.  Actors would start their lines one second too late.  There weren't enough microphones on set, so even if you turn your TV volume up, you may not hear some of what is said.  Hard economic times is supposed to explain why the main character's house and place of work barely have any furniture in them.  However, the clear answer is that this low-budget production couldn't afford that.  This film is ridiculously subpar and I think a film student would be expelled from graduate school due to it.  This film killed brain cells and I'd sue its creators if I had the moxy.",1245542400,,960,4.44
