There's always something new for me catch.  It's a beautiful expression of Truth, Simplicity and Love.

If at first you don't get it, watch again.  Repeat.  Dennis is _very_ down-to-earth.  You will get it, then repeat again.  Repetition, repetition, repetition is the key.  Thank you Dennis!",1426032000,,508,4.747126436781609
