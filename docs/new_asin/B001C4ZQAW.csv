3. Field of Screams Part 1 - Doctor Crowler duels against a vampire lady named Camula, where if he looses he turns into a doll! Crowler looses and Camula throws his doll self to the ground and turns into a bunch of bats and flies to a mysterious castle.

4. Field of Screams Part 2 - Zane decides to duel against Camula for revenge of Crowler, since he knew that the vampire wanted to duel him previously instead of Crowler. Camula steals Cyrus and uses him as a hostage where he might get hurt if Zane attacks him. Zane stands down in order to save his brother and lets the Cyber End dragon that Camula brought back from the grave to wipe out his life points. Zane turns into a doll, too.

5. Field of Screams Part 3 - Jaden, though still weak from his duel against Nightshroud, battles Camula. Camula is defeated and Zane and Crowler return to normal again and they all run out outside just in time before the entire castle collapses.

6. The Fear Factor - Jaden is troubled by a strange dream he had and is scared. Kuriboh takes him to the spirit realm where he duels Kaiba Man to overcome his fear of loosing.

9. Duel Distractions part 2 - Bastian is devastated by his loss from Tanya, who kicked him out since she did not deem him worthy anymore, and Jaden duels Tanya to prove to Bastian that he doesn't have to be in love to duel with passion.
