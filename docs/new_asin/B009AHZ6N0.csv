8538430,5,B009AHZ6N0,For a small budget film the quality is of a higher production level. This group of people that put this together are going to be one of the most priemer groups in the film industry soon. I would say its a must buy.,1355184000,,214,4.0

8538432,5,B009AHZ6N0,"""Unsearchable"" is a movie full of inspiration. I was a little leery about watching a post-apocalyptic movie, but this one was awesome. The storyline and filming were top-notch. I am amazed that it was all created by teenagers. Our family watched this movie together, and it reminded us never to take one another for granted.",1348099200,,324,4.909090909090909
8538433,5,B009AHZ6N0,"I'm usually that girl who chooses to watch chick flicks/romantic comedies or comedies on date nights at the movies. I also HATE sci-fi movies or post-apocalyptic movies too. So when I heard my friends were making a post-apocalyptic movie, I was excited and worried at the same time: excited to see a movie my friends made yet worried I wouldn't like it. The trailer looked awesome, which definitely helped with the excitement factor  With movies, if it doesn't hook me almost instantly, I'll lose interest. But with Unsearchable, it did not take long for me to be totally sucked into the movie! I was MORE than impressed, and I LOVE the movie! It has definitely been added to my favorites list. And although most post-apocalyptic movies are virtually the same, Unsearchable's plot has certain events that take place that set it apart from other post-apocalyptic movies. Great job, you guys!",1347580800,,890,4.933333333333334

I think it's the only movie I've seen where I didn't keep checking my watch and wondering - how much longer do I have to sit here?",1347580800,,249,4.1020408163265305
