3691629,5,B001LWBLWC,"This is my first time seeing burlesque with fans and it is a well-produced, well-directed DVD full of information, history, and gorgeous costumes!  This is a nice change of pace from the speed other dance DVDs I've been doing.  Out of the three demos and step by step routines, I very much enjoyed doing the veil fan section because veils were more handy.  Watching the demo (the full dance routine) a couple of times before starting, then ready to do the step by step with instructor Jody several times and then back to the demo at tempo.  The music is appropriate to help you with the moves, it's all in the arms, so footwork was not a problem.  The moves you'll do are listed on the bottom corner, never more than 5 or 6 moves. Pleased to have this addition to my fitness library.  We thoroughly had so much fun performing the veil fan section.  So have a girl's night, dress up, and dance!",1275523200,6,893,4.408536585365853

3691631,5,B001LWBLWC,"Jo Weldon returns with her second program, Silk and Feathers Burlesque Fan Dance.. Ms. Weldon is the founder of the New York School of Burlesque. This program is slightly over one hour long and is so captivating that it seems to sweep by too quickly!
The program sections are neatly arranged  with ease of navigating from one section to the next.
To begin, a candid welcome and short history and tribute to burlesque, Sally Rand and her dance career.
A brief chat on types of fans used in many dances.
A demonstration on ostrich fans allows the viewer the details in  fans and size, arm and hand positions, types of feathers and staves used, using the fans open or bolted,
The warm up is simple, set to slow tempo and Jo is comfortable in lingerie and high heels demonstrating  shoulder rolls, chest circles simple pelvic rotations
The instructional section follows with three  dance demonstrations . Here you will learn  to incorporate the beautiful fans into three  beginner dance routines. Each routine uses different fans and their basic arm and hand technique. The following fans are used in the routines:
 Large  Ostrich  fans which are glamorous and the moves such as layering reveal, pulsing, swirls, are used to conceal and reveal the body during the dance.
Small fans are used in  4 step by step combos in a saucy number with big attitude, framing the body and flirty.
Silk fan veils are used in the last 4 step by step combos. These are very basic  flutters that embellish the body in a sensual way,.The fans are used closed as well to accent drum beats.
Also included in this dvd is a  trailer from the video ""Honey and Spice Sensual and Fierce Burlesque"", also by Jo Weldon.
The music is fantastic new Orleans jazz  from Ronnie Magri's album.
This  is a captivating program, with beautiful costumes and backdrops. It is great  for personal enrichment,or to implement into established dance. The instructor presents her program in a concise, down to earth manner which makes all the routines easy to learn. I am hoping for more since I have bought all these plumes!",1241395200,12,2077,4.7465181058495824

8319941,4,B001LWBLWC,"DVD is very good. Breaks things down and provides good, clear instructions for fan dancing. International shipping took a bit longer than expected.",1437264000,,147,5.434782608695652
8319942,5,B001LWBLWC,I love it!!!!,1426377600,,13,3.6666666666666665
8319943,4,B001LWBLWC,"It's a good video but not great unless you got the honey and spice video first. Great instruction, nice beginner routines, could have used a little more explanation on what I'm doing with my torso while moving the fans.",1423180800,,219,4.641025641025641
8319944,5,B001LWBLWC,Learned all my fan dancing essentials off this DVD. The best!,1415750400,,61,4.636363636363637
8319945,5,B001LWBLWC,I have been a burlesque dancer for about 7 years now and I want to add ostrich fan dancing to my skills. I was in need of a very easy to understand instructional DVD that I could work with on my own time to perfect my technique. This was exactly what I was looking for.  I found the routine very easy to learn and with practice I've managed to put together a very simple act that doesn't look too amateurish. If you have worked with fans before this will be review but if you are brand new to the art you will find this a very good resource. There is also a very nice section on the history of the burlesque fan dance. I have shared this DVD with my entire troupe.,1396396800,,664,4.03030303030303
8319946,3,B001LWBLWC,"I purchased the whole Burlesque series-Honey & Spice, Striptease for Burlesque, Silk & Feathers by Jo Weldon, based on the clips I saw at the New York Burlesque school website. It looked like fun & I liked that she taught and that she spoke about about feeling sexy & good about yourself. So I was excited to try these DVDs out.

There is alot of good info on these DVDs, history, Burlesque as a art form, tips, positioning and basic instruction. Especially if you have never done this type of thing before. But I found the instructor's persona left me flat & it was hard for me to stay excited about learning the material all the way through, for she seemed to come across as hard & detached.

With Silk & Feathers, I wanted to learn how to dance with the Sally Rann type fans- there is lots of prep-how to hold, tips, history, what kind to buy, etc. but there weren't enough actual fan dancing moves taught in the routine. Jo did teach a step by step choreography with them- but it was really a series of short simple poses strung together. It looked ametuer to me. I could have figured out how to do this from what was offered in the reveal & conceal section. Maybe that's just me, I guess I expected too much.

The rest of what is taught is with smaller fans & fan veils (bellydance). I personally don't feel they have the same mystic & presence of the large fans, so the rest of the material wasn't relevant for me.

I will say there is alot of good information on this dvd. If you are looking for instruction on the large dance fans, this is a good introduction- but there's not enough here to really learn how to dance with them.

I wish there were more instructional dvds available on this topic...if there were I would buy them.",1388016000,,1737,4.348765432098766
8319947,4,B001LWBLWC,It was super easy and fun but also very short in duration. It's a great resource for the beginning fan dancer.,1386547200,,110,4.285714285714286
8319948,4,B001LWBLWC,"Some very good ideas, and movements. Could use more detail about types of feather fans. She is using clear stays, the ones I have are bamboo. Same techniques for most, but the dark bamboo does change the photo shoot.",1376784000,2,216,4.564102564102564
8319949,5,B001LWBLWC,"I ended up writing 3 pages of notes on this DVD!  In the first section of the video, instructor Jo Weldon gives a background on burlesque dance history and the ins and outs of the three different kinds of fans she uses in  Immediately I began thinking, ""gee I probably should have had some fans on hand if I was going to do this video...""  Duh!  But even without fans, I got a lot out of her technique lessons about where to place the fans to frame yourself best and a lot of little tricks that only a professional dancer would know, and also the names of the different positions which is very helpful when writing your own choreography.

I thought this video was well shot--the first section is on a burlesque stage from back in the day and the dance technique portions are on a more modern stage.  Her costumes are just stunning and unique--she's a beautiful dancer.  I liked how during the performance the names of the steps were printed on the screen--it helped me take notes and follow along.  This DVD generously contains 3 different routines with 3 different kinds of fans (large ostrich feather, small marabou feather fans and silk ""veil"" fans).  I just loved the New Orleans jazz music she chose!  While I may not ever perform her routines exactly, (and I can guarantee that I wouldn't perform striptease for anyone but my husband!) I feel like I learned a TON of technique from this, got some great tips on everything from costuming--how to ""trick"" your bra so it's easier to take off with one hand, what size fans to get, how to store them, and reminders on the importance of facial expressions.

If you are looking to burn calories while doing a sexy dance routine, then this is not for you.  But if you are a belly dancer/burlesque dancer/exotic dancer--even if it's only for an audience of one--then grab a notebook and watch this!",1373414400,,1845,4.557575757575758
