1206571,4,B00000FB1U,"In my review of 'Cabaret', I rather rashly claimed that Liza's turn as self-destructive Ingenue Sally Bowles was her 'once-in-a-lifetime' performance. That, however, was before I caught this 1969 Gem, 'The Sterile Cuckoo', on Sky Classics.
Beautifully-directed by Alan Pakula in that strange, isolated, stereotypical 1960's-flick style, 'The Sterile Cuckoo' tells the bittersweet, emotionally macabre tale of anally-retentive college freshman Jerry Payne (Wendell Burton), and his intense relationship with the scatterbrained, maniacal Pookie Adams (Liza Minnelli), an enigmatic and energetic girl with a sad past.
Liza's first Oscar nomination was very thoroughly deserved. Even as late as 1969 the Oscars were not yet the meaningless PR-Fest that we now know them to be, and it's nominations for odd, thought-provoking performances like Minnelli's, here, that restores our faith in that system. She's absorbing and heart-wrenching, infuriating and devastating, all at the same time. Her perfect foil comes in the guise of the extremely skillfull performance turned in by Wendell Burton, in the role of her hapless boyfriend Jerry. He's the ideal contrast to Minnelli's mania, and though we are oftentimes infuriated by his apathy, we can't help but simultaneously sympathise with him.
Pakula's direction is excellent. The vistas are beautiful; simple and isolated, with so much 'New England' jumping from the screen as to make you all but feel the leaves crunching beneath your feet. The sparse countryside, punctuated by violent outbursts of colour, is the perfect metaphor for the central relationship, and Pakula makes extremely clever use of this in the scenes of Pookie and Jerry's early relationship.
A classic slice of 60's ideal surrealism, this is a beautifully-crafted, emotionally absorbing movie that REALLY should be on DVD by now. Highly recommended.",1074902400,89,1866,5.620567375886525
1206572,5,B00000FB1U,"The first time I saw this movie it bothered me.  Watching the love story develop between Pookie and Roger was like watching a horror movie, I kept wanting to yell at the guy for getting into a relationship with this obviously unstable, needy, life-sucking parasite of a human being.  But the film haunted me (maybe because I couldn't get ""Come Saturday Morning"" out of my mind), so much so I bought the video.  It's really a different film that couldn't be made today.  The pace is different, the plot depends on the characters, Liza Minelli's performance breaks your heart.  I suggest this film to anyone who doesn't like the typical romance film of the ""Pretty Woman"" persuasion.  Watch it after you've broken up with somebody if you want a good cry.",1054598400,62,752,4.702290076335878
1206573,4,B00000FB1U,"It took me awhile to discover this movie. I was out of college by the time I saw it...but it made me want to reverse time and go back to that time in my life.
Liza's great, the cast is great and everything about it is so ""strained"" that it encapsulates everyone's feelings of not fitting in at one time or another. And it's got a great sixties feel to it that sits right on the very white-bread verge of the end of innocence.",1040947200,16,425,4.071428571428571
1206574,5,B00000FB1U,"This is one of Liza Minnelli's earliest films, and her first Academy Award nomination.  She is outstanding as Pookie Adams, a lonely girl from a family with a sad history.  She is highly intelligent and extremely winning, especially in the first scene, on a bus, where she manipulates some nuns into letting her sit next to the object of her desire, Jerry Payne.  They are going to near-by colleges, and Pookie pursues Jerry, cleverly winning him over, until he finally falls in love with her.  In my opinion this is the all-time best coming of age movie!

1206666,4,B00000FB1U,"I've always wondered about THE STERILE CUCKOO and was glad to finally find it on DVD.  I never knew what the title meant (and still don't) and viewed the movie with absolutely no idea of the storyline. I just knew this was Liza Minnelli's first starring role in a motion picture.

It's amazing to take a step back into 1969. Liza is young and vibrant and one can think of the career and the trials and tribulations to come in the next decades for Minnelli. THE STERILE CUCKOO looks dated immediately--the cars, the clothes, the photography, the setting and the music, yet there is something sweet and well-intentioned about the story. Liza stars as the eccentric Pookie Adam who will never fit in and does not want to fit in with the real world.  Pookie annoyingly latches on to quiet shy and boyishly handsome Jerry Payne (Wendell Burton) on a bus ride to their nearby colleges.

Burton and Minnelli are absolutely perfect as the mismatched lovers. Here we have a sweet story of young love and the paths two people take in their mutual need for love and acceptance. It's a beautiful story but THE STERILE CUCKOO is seriously slow moving and scene after scene of Pookie and Jerry running or playing can be long winded. Ultimately, it's a somewhat tragic love story of two very different people trying to make sense of their young lives.

Burton is the perfect Jerry to Minnelli's Pookie. I was curious about his career and think he should have been a bigger actor in t he 70's with his seriously real talent. As for Liza, we know what the future held for her. It's bittersweet to step back in time to see two actors in their youth and to revisit a very different world.",1483920000,2,1669,4.55

Was I like that as a young adult, when first love comes on so strong and you believe that you will die if you cannot be with that person.  Pooky went too far over the top and she was obsessed and probably needed a mother or mother figure.  But anyone who has been there can feel her pain and anguish and cringe at her mistakes.  You will not like this film if you do not cherish memories of you from long ago.  If you cannot remember eing that young and first ;ove, then skip it.  Otherwise, see it and enjoy it for the beautiful film that it is.",1476316800,4,586,4.043478260869565

1206746,4,B00000FB1U,"Liza Minnelli was continually fabulous in her portrayal of a needy, unstable girl looking for someone to help ground her.  Only a talented, committed actress could have pulled it off so well.  I saw this movie as a teenager and again decades later after having a lot of relationship experience under my belt.  As a teenager, I was moved and deeply saddened by everything she felt - the neediness, the unrequited love, the fact that she would not be made complete by yet another person in her life....all the drama that so many teenage girls go through at a time when love and romance feels like life or death.  But watching this film as an adult, I found her character self-involved, pathetic and wildly annoying and could barely stand to listen to her never-ending craziness.  I couldn't imagine why a guy would ever find someone like that remotely appealing, except for a physical encounter. And yet, the movie is so intriguing that you want to watch just to see what happens next.  It's like peeking at a car accident as you pass by.  All in all, it's a film well done and timeless as far as showcasing the vulnerability and naivety of youth.",1466380800,,1145,4.610837438423645
1206747,5,B00000FB1U,"To me the best performance Liza (with a Z) ever did.

1206869,5,B00000FB1U,"1970 was a VERY strange year for handing out the Oscars for 1969's Best.  Who knows, it may take a lot of decades for the BIGGEST blunders in Hollywood's history to ""sink in.""  But Liza Minnelli's Very First Oscar nomination for her Very First Starring Role (in ""The Sterile Cuckoo"") should have become her Very First Oscar .... because it was just as well-deserved as it would be a couple of years later when what should have been her SECOND Oscar was awarded to her for ""Cabaret.""  Certainly different types of movies and a different style of performance, but with Liza displaying the same brilliance, the same raw emotion and depth of character interpretation and understanding, in BOTH spectacular roles.  And that miscarriage of justice was carried even further when they gave the Academy Award to Maggie Smith, of ALL the other nominees, for delivering her polished but repetitious British ""schtick"" in ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.""  Liza Minnelli had been electrifying in every twist and nuance she delivered in her portrayal .... Maggie Smith had been .... Maggie Smith.
However '70 was the very same year they gave an Oscar to John Wayne for ""True Grit"" (or more accurately because he was dying of cancer.)  If ever an actor deserved an Oscar for his impressive BODY of work, it was the Duke.  But to honor him for that one forgettable film while DIShonoring the truly gifted acting of Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight in the Best Picture of the Year, ""Midnight Cowboy"" .... or once again ignoring Richard Burton (that year for ""Anne of a Thousand Days"") .... is just unethical.
But those are just my opening arguments!  Wait till I do battle with a MOVIE Academy Award being given to a Broadway star bringing her nightly stage show to a movie set (think, perhaps, of Judy Holiday in ""Born Yesterday"") instead of great movie stars in the MOVIE roles of their lifetimes (and you can give a thought to TWO of them .... Bette Davis in ""All About Eve"" or Gloria Swanson in ""Sunset Boulevard."")  I'll even be a little bit nasty about poor Shirley Booth, never meant for the movies, reprising her Broadway role for the screen in ""Come Back, Little Sheba.""  (Or don't.) While that year Barbara Stanwyck in ""Titanic"" and Jane Wyman in ""So Big"" gave much better MOVIE performances (but neither was even NOMINATED for Oscar!)  Just ... not ... fair.",1433376000,,2348,4.730392156862745

It is also interesting to see Liza Minnelli in such an early acting role.  She is very good, especially when bad acting was so prevalent in 1960's movies.  Lastly, the movie has a message about time and life that was though provoking.  I got that we might have to move further in our lives, but that doesn't necessarily mean that we leave the moments that went before.  I also liked that the stars of the movie didn't need to be part of the ""party scene.""

1207008,1,B00000FB1U,"I read ""The Sterile Cuckoo"" when it was published in 1965 and several times since.  Summary of the book:  Jerry Payne, stereotype WASP nerd, falls in love with Pookie Adams, witty, clever, eccentric middle American girl.  Their romance blossoms.  Jerry evolves, Pookie doesn't, the romance turns to crap.

The movie, which I just watched for the first time after buying the DVD, had many flaws, but at least it was consistent -- crap from start to finish.  The basic problem was the movie Pookie.  Dumbed down into a nut case.

The movie was made in 1969.  The DVD's technical qualities could have been 1929.  Color pretty bad.  Sound -- well, it was like listening to a 1969 car radio in a rainstorm.

Her character-Pookie is eccentric, but also a very guarded individual. Wendell Burton (Jerry Payne) plays the her significant other with a faithful and compassionate gesture in every shot. The relationship between the two main characters is ordinary and yet not ordinary. The difference is that the relationship is ""reality exposed"" because it is like watching two lovers taking slow steps to one another's weaknesses and strengths. Pookie's strength: She is like a ""wounded bird"" but she has this peculiar aura; we are not here to judge her. Her weakness: Her ""psychological wounds"" are not as transparent, so in all awkwardness she is unable to be a part of the environment she lives in...Burton's character, I believe, brings this self-awareness (although he is also trying to be a part of the environment he lives in ) out from the world of sterility and into the world of understanding and unconditional love.",1399939200,,1081,5.044692737430168

Jerry is repressed and inexperienced and blossoms from Pookies sheer life force, but is too young to be burdoned with the responsibilty of saving her.

The story reflects many attitudes of college students of the times, many of the typical situations students were involved in at the time.  Also the main character, played by Liza Minnelli, who was wonderful in the role, was an odd ball and had difficulty relating to her peers in almost every way.  It's a character probably every student can relate to, no matter what generation.  It's funny at times and sad at times.  She finds a boyfriend, who at first finds her odd, then gets along with her because he also feels out of place at college at first like she does.  Eventually he does blend in and he outgrows her, and he gently tries to break off with her, leaving her quite upset she can not handle it.  She ends up leaving college, and the viewer is left to wonder what will happen to her and hopes she adapts to life.  A great, great film, highly recommended.

""Oscar-worthy"" is overused but not here- she imports feelings and reactions that most people can actually connect with on some level, and considering that is from a place of loneliness and mental issues, it is all the more surprising.

""The Sterile Cuckoo"" has a soft-focus, mildly color-washed-out picture, likely due to the year of the film (1969) and thus some aging to the master. The audio is good. I'm very pleased with this purchase, actually, which is an upgrade to the DVD I already owned.

I've definitely seen several 1967-69 blu-ray films that look a lot sharper and better all-around (heck, my DVD--not blu-ray--of 1967's ""Bedazzled"" (Dudley Moore, Raquel Welch) looks much sharper on my HD TV than does ""The Sterile Cuckoo""!).  But, I suspect that ""The Sterile Cuckoo"" was not a big-budget film.

Today's generation may not identify with those times but I do and I bet many of my generation would still see what I see (I am 72).

1207209,5,B00000FB1U,"The Sterile Cuckoo, the first film effort by late director Alan J. Pakula (Klute, Starting Over) is a fairly straightforward, bittersweet tale of first love represented as a touching, coming-of-age character study. Soft-spoken biology major Jerry Payne (Wendell Burton) encounters bespectacled oddball, Pookie Adams (Liza Minnelli) as both are waiting for a bus to take them to their first semesters at neighboring colleges. The extroverted but socially awkward Pookie either misinterprets Jerry's passive malleability as interest or willfully disregards the possible indifference masked by his mostly silent countenance, and insists that the two share a mutual attraction (""We got along terrifically on the bus!"" she asserts). Pookie, an outcast who aggressively overcompensates and guards her lonely vulnerability behind the labeling of others as creeps, weirdos, or bad eggs, is clearly drawn to the nice, button-down sweetness of the biology major, but one senses that she's a type who habitually latches onto strangers. For his part, the overwhelmed Jerry doesn't so much warm to Pookies charms as succumbs to the force of her persistent will.",1363910400,6,1148,5.603448275862069

1207214,4,B00000FB1U,"Amazed that I have never seen this film from the late 60s. Minelli as Pookie Adams is quite incredible. A damaged teenager going to college,hooking up with reserved young student Jerry Payne(Wendell Burton).Her desperation from a lonely background and her desire to see all other people as `weirdos',drives her to be taken under some one's wing. She's kooky,she pursues Jerry with energy,animation and humour,helps bring him out of his shell in his 1st few months at school. He gives her a reprieve from her father who has held her responsible for her mother's early death. The film is shot with a straightforwardness and honesty and an indie charm that winds you in. The scene where they go to a motel,its cold and Jerry can't light the fire,he strips Pookie,folds her clothes up and puts them on a chair,and they snuggle up in a creaky bed. Pakula also stages a very funny and bleak fraternity party that turns into the sort of beery roughhouse, which to freshmen might pass for an orgy. Pookie embarrasses Jerry in public with her manic-depressive symptoms and attack on the `weirdos'. Also very good is Tim McIntire as Jerry's kind of typical frat boy loutish roommate. Jerry is getting closer to the `weirdos' and drifts away from Pookie as he makes his way into the world.

Need doesn't translate into true love,though it translates into lust for a while. Its also very moving like when Pookie makes the phone call to salvage what is left of their love or Jerry very gently has to let her down,still caring and enquiring about her. It uncomfortably reminds us of our own early experiences and search for love. There is a gentle wistfulness to the music Come Saturday Morning and the centrepiece is the landscape shot in upstate New York and in spring, summer, and autumn it is heavenly with the greens and autumn changes in the leaves. The sound mix suffers when Alan J. Pakula and company shoot outside (Liza Minnelli is nearly inaudible when Pookie and Jerry wander through the cemetery). Subtitles could have compensated for that loss. Pakula's directorial debut takes a done-to-death story template and revitalizes it with intelligence, maturity, and tenderness. A refreshing work that shows the quality of late 60s early 70s American cinema and Pakula's 1st,before the French took over.",1357171200,4,2297,4.920103092783505

Interestingly, I had difficulty watching this movie.  It evoked so many emotions that I was uncomfortable with some of my feelings.  This is especially true when Pookie was vulnerable - because I cared about her and I did not want her to be hurt.  Pookie is a conflicted character.  Underneath her outgoing behavior is a young lady in much pain - and I could sense her pain throughout the story.  Note that Liza showed incredible acting talent to pull off Pookie's inner conflicts.

Character-driven all the way, this is an important story that all young people should see.  And yet, many young people are now consumed with texting and empty-headed computer games - instead of feeling connection and love with each other.

I was put off at first by the fact that the title of the movie was wrong on the packaging - the producers, called Olive Films, had labelled it ""Sterile Cuckoo"" when it is actually ""The Sterile Cuckoo"".  A small detail, admittedly, but still...

also - the description blurb on the back cover is almost unreadable as it's white typescript on a yellow background - did no one at Olive Films catch that???

That aside, I was glad to see the film itself decently reproduced.  There are no extras at all, just the film and chapters, but that's all right.  My four star review is for the DVD itself, not the film, which I go back and forth on in opinion.  I've seen it many times since my first viewing in 1973, and can't seem to settle on a definitive opinion, so judge for yourself.  Keep in mind that 1969 was a different time than 2012, and while a girl like Pookie now would be put on medication, in her own time she was just marginalized by the ""cool"" kids and ultimately ""sent to the cornfield"" by her first boyfriend.

1207281,5,B00000FB1U,"Pookie Adams is an 18-year-old heading off to her first year at college. She meets another new freshman, Jerry Payne, on the bus. Jerry is a shy boy who will be majoring in biology with the intention of pursuing the study of insects. He is initially put off by Pookie's brash behavior and incessant conversation that flits from one topic to another like a butterfly. But she pursues him, visiting him at his college for a weekend and writing him endless letters. Eventually he is charmed by her smile, her wit, and her vivacious personality. They fall into an affair and life is briefly magical. But Jerry begins to realize that Pookie wants every minute of his life and attention all to herself. He sees that he is in a relationship that will suffocate him and he breaks it off as gently as he is able. In the heartbreaking final scene, he helps her board a bus that will take her home and watches sadly as the bus pulls away. Liza Minnelli's portrayal of the mercurial Pookie, who is haunted by the fact that her mother died giving birth to her, and that her father has always resented her for it, received a Best Actress Oscar nomination. Wendell Burton, who played Jerry Payne, is equally impressive as the inexperienced boy drawn into a relationship that he is ultimately unable to cope with. The goodness and innocence of both lead characters magnifies the pain they unintentionally inflict on each other. The movie's theme song, ""Come Saturday Morning,"" also Oscar nominated, seems almost to have been written for this story and adds beautifully to the magic.

That's unfortunate, because I think that I would have really benefited from seeing this movie as a young person--and gotten a sort of heads-up on the problems that come with a serious relationship.

In other reviews and descriptions of this film, the situation is described as one in which the reserved and quiet Jerry outgrows his kooky and impulsive girlfriend Pookie.  I think, however, that the breakup occurs for a rather different reason.  It is more that Jerry is worn down by Pookie.  He just can't take this kind of erratic behavior any more--especially since he is a college student majoring in a difficult subject (biology) and needs to study and get some work done!  The turning point, where he begins to realize that this relationship is ultimately untenable, is the scene in which Pookie has something like a manic episode at a house party given by Jerry's college friends and housemates.  Pookie berates and insults everybody she can think of, including Jerry's friend and roommate Charlie (who she sort of flirts with as well), which is terribly embarrassing and hurtful for Jerry.  A guy doesn't get over this kind of thing very easily!  If Pookie had done something as grossly embarrassing as this to him in public at an earlier stage of their relationship, the breakup would have come much more quickly than it did in this movie!  Once it happened, such an event would play like a Youtube video in his mind in a never ending loop--over and over again--especially when attempting to study dry academic subjects!

Pookie apologizes--but it was too little too late.  Jerry knows that Pookie's erratic behavior will continue.  And even when she appears stable, he has to be waiting for the next shoe to drop.  In the end, Jerry is not angry at Pookie--he still clearly cares for her--he just can't continue to deal with her day in and day out.  The continuation and temptation of an emotionally-intense physical relationship would also be troubling, as he would fear being held emotionally hostage by a person who might blow up at him any moment.  Essentially, Jerry decides to opt out of the relationship just to avoid being hurt any further.

It is probably true that Jerry benefited from meeting Pookie.  A reserved guy like him probably needed a girl who worked so hard to get his attention--and who refused to accept his desire to retreat and isolate himself.  After this relationship he would probably be able to respond to the more subtle overtures from girls who are less confrontational and better emotionally balanced.

In the end, I found this to be an interesting movie that does a good job showing how this kind of relationship plays out.  From other people's comments I gather that this kind of dramatic first love is fairly typical.  One's first deep relationship, however, can still be heart-wrenching without one's significant other being as unstable as poor Pookie!",1318636800,4,3101,4.8444022770398485
1207345,5,B00000FB1U,"In an odd little college, which I presume to be in Vermont or upstate Nueva York, two lost souls are slowly and surely attracted to each other by the power of the will of an eccentric young woman.
From the start we know she is clever and outspoken. And she is heartbreakingly fragile.
He's the opposite. Quiet and so unsure but firm as a straught arrow.

You could almost say this is just a plain old love story.
But it is about moods.
You never see a classroom at the college, only the dorms and the student boardinghouse, the bar and the surrounding countryside.

The mood is somber; as if that rural area excused itself from the world and settled down to leaf-strewn environs and navel gazing. The bar scene intrudes loudly into this atmospheric and quiet movie. But it is a jolt that is needed to again set the mood of a contrast and then settle back into a tiny community away from the world. And for two young, insecure people, they too are cut off from the world. They need each other but the mania of one creates a rift.

Dark, quiet, painful looks from Wendell Burton ahd Liza.
There is a magical quality you cannot quite put your finger on. It is the quiet, reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's moody movie ""5 Easy Pieces.""

Liza is the only one now in my mind who can play Pookie. Burton, forever the unsure virgin who learns and then regrets and then goes forth.
The sadness is that not every body can be saved. Sometimes, one has to go for one to be saved.

1207347,5,B00000FB1U,"I kind of all sorts of adore Liza Minnelli.  She has such a warm endearing quality.  She is spunky and witty and charming in a goofy sort of way, but she certainly doesn't lack in the sensual department.  Despite her unconventional appearance, she knew how to make herself more than appealing while in her prime.  Just watch `Cabaret' and tell me you weren't the least bit intrigued.

All that said, it took me quote some time to finally see `The Sterile Cuckoo', one of Liza's first big roles.  I sat down to soak it in a few days ago and I'm still giddy with amusement.  I don't mean that to make it sound as if this is a laugh riot because it is not.  `The Sterile Cuckoo' is far from a comedy.  It is a serious and deeply provocative film about the insecurities of a young woman and the mess they make of her relationships.  Sure, the film has its amusing (funny) moments, but they are peppered in over a series of poignant and meaningful interactions.

The film tells the story of Mary Ann Adams, better known as Pookie.  When we meet Pookie she is introducing herself to a shy young man named Jerry Payne.  They are both off to college.  Pookie is aggressive and abrupt, but she is endearing.  Pookie finds a way to weasel herself in Jerry's life, and soon the two are dating.  The first half of the film plays out almost like a romantic comedy, but as the second half begins to roll around we see the layers of this film begin to fall away, baring a soul we may not have expected.  As Pookie begins to exhibit strange behavior, her relationship with Jerry starts to fray.  She becomes possessive and spiteful.  She becomes controlling and jealous and erratic.  Jerry starts to pull away, causing a rift between the two that will prove nearly disastrous for young Pookie.

What I liked so much about `The Sterile Cuckoo' was that it didn't try so hard.  It simply allowed the audience to pick up on the subtle clues as to Pookie's behavior.  We are never outright told about her life, at least not in a direct `this has messed me up' type manner, but we are given little hints here and there that, when picked up on and spliced together, tell a complete story about this very complicated young woman.

I was telling a friend the other day that Pookie Adams may be one of my favorite film characters, ever.  She just has so many beautiful details that make her so relatable and sympathetic.  Despite her apparent flaws (and she has many of them) she is so likable.

That likeability comes almost directly from Liza Minnelli's brilliant performance.  The way she handles Pookie is flawless.  She understands how important it is to allow the layers to speak for themselves.  She never forces anything and she completely understands that Pookie's spunky personality is her shield, and she plays it as such, always inserting a manic sense of insecurity in her outlandish behavior.  You can always see that she is scared, even when she puts up the pretense that she is not.  Wendell Burton is also very, very good here.  He plays Jerry straight-laced and nave, but not so much that he becomes unbelievably dense.  Instead, Jerry comes off as insecure, just like Pookie; he just displays it differently.  I was very impressed with Tim McIntire.  With just a few short scenes he was able to create a very lasting impression.  With rugged good looks and a commanding sense of confidence, McIntire creates the perfect `wedge' in Pookie and Jerry's relationship.  What is also so fascinating is that you truly believe him when he allows his insecurities to be made known as well.

This is a beautiful film about finding oneself and rising above our past.  Pookie self destructed thanks to an innate need to be loved that was not being met.  Watching her crumble can be heartbreaking, but it is also tragically beautiful.

1207348,5,B00000FB1U,"Character-driven stories, when they are well-written and the characters are well-formed, tend to be more satisfying than plot-driven stories because although we can get excited about intricate plots, we have our strongest feelings about real people. And plot-driven stories tend to be inhabited by one-dimensional characters. This is not to say that plot-driven stories have no place. It's just that in plot-driven stories we care more about *what happens* than we do about who made it happen and who it happened *to*.

If there is a better example of a purely character-driven story on film, I haven't seen it. The character of ""Pookie"" is very well drawn, and her character drives the movie. We know less about Jerry. All we know about him we know by his reactions to Pookie. Obviously the author of the novel the movie was based on drew the character of Pookie extremely well. She dominates the story. This movie is an excellent example of how a single well-drawn character can cause a story to happen. The whole story is within Pookie. Even her relationship with Jerry is ultimately within her own mind, because she doesn't know how to interact with people. She interacts with who she thinks he is. And who she thinks he is, ultimately, is a ""weirdo"", just like she thinks all people but herself are weirdos.

Pookie sees the world in black and white terms. It's her against the world. That's how it has always been for her. It's all she knows. Jerry seems to be the first person she has ever really cared about. This presents her with an existential crisis. She must grow up fast, but she has precious little social experience. Before Jerry, she has always treated people with contempt. She tried to make a connection with her father, but it always went wrong. They don't understand each other. So she grows up isolated. And when she finally falls on love, it's not easy for her to switch gears and start seeing Jerry as a fellow human being, no matter how deeply she has grown dependent on him.

It's easy to miss what this story is all about. It's easy to think there is no story or plot at all. And that's what I think is so great about this movie. The story is so subtle that it's depth is easily overlooked. It's Pookie against the world, in her opinion. And when the world finally offers her something of true value---*JERRY*---she is too scarred, to scared, and too mistrustful to accept it as the blessing that it is. Consequently she makes a mess out of it.

And finally: this movie came out in 1969 and is very dated. I don't know why the term ""dated"" has become so derogatory. The fact that it is ""dated"" makes it all the more important, in my opinion. Filmmaking has gotten to be too precise of an art. Why shouldn't a good film capture an elusive moment in time? As time marches on, we become less connected to the generations of people who came before us. And it is vitally important that we understand them, because we are extensions of them. In order to fully understand ourselves we must understand them and the legacy they left us with. This is not to say that all the children of the sixties were as naive as the two main characters in The Sterile Cuckoo. That's not true. But the movie did an excellent job of capturing those two characters in their time---the year of 1969.",1272412800,7,3299,4.5864406779661016
1207349,4,B00000FB1U,"This is an absolute classic film with an Oscar nominated performance by Liza Minnelli.  The film was directed by Alan J. Pakula (who directed ""Klute,"" ""All the President's Men"" and ""Sophie's Choice"") - so where is the DVD?  What's the hold up?  There is so much garbage out there on DVD (and I'm talking foul smelling stuff that no one wants in their home) - so please, PLEASE, give Pookie/Liza her due.",1237680000,3,403,4.569444444444445
1207350,5,B00000FB1U,"I just got through reading a book about Liza the other today (the book was lousy) but it described ""The Sterile Cuckoo"" which I have never seen or heard of before. I looked online for it and all I could find was the used copies on this site for eighteen bucks. So imagine my surprise when it came on TCM this week. What luck, right?

Wendell Burton was the perfect actor to play the role of Jerry because he did everything I expected him to do and in a way he did everything that I wanted him to do. And Liza did such a first-rate job as Pookie because she gave this young lady life and body and comedy and character and sorrow. There was something very touching (and perhaps even rather tragic) to this creature. Because Pookie was the type of person that drew people to her with one hand (she craved attention and affection) while simultaneously pushing them away with the other. It was like breathing, she just couldn't help it.

My favorite part was the scene when they went to that little roadside motel. It was absolutely hysterical because Pookie was so into it and good girls (especially girls from the nineteen-sixties) were always supposed to suppress their feelings. To see such a brazen act on film was a real shocker. I love how she ordered Jerry to ""peal the tomato."" When I first saw Pookie with those black granny-glasses she totally resembled Paul Pfeiffer from ""The Wonder Years"". But after she hops into that squeaky bed I saw an innocence in her that otherwise went undetected. And after it was all finished she felt sad. No, not guilty-sad, but pensive-sad. Like Pookie explained to Jerry ""it's too perfect"" and as we all know there is no such thing as perfect.

The movie is very haunting, perhaps because there is something extraordinarily familiar about both Pookie and Jerry. Jerry reminded me of every guy I've ever known. And Pookie was like that crazy girl in college that never wanted to do what anyone else did and always showed up late everywhere and was always terribly disorganized but was still capable to cleaning up her act every once in a while.

It's no surprise that Liza was nominated for her first Oscar because her alter-ego runs the gamut of funny, obsessive, hysterical and desperate. The scene with her on the phone with Jerry, pleading to spend Easter vacation with him (while he studies because he received some ""flunk-notices"") really showed the type of person Pookie truly was. She was so terrified of being alone. She was downright afraid of being one of the countless causalities in this world that swallows people up whole and throws them away, without a second thought. I could feel her anguish and frustration as she begged and pleaded with Jerry. But Pookie really didn't need to say a word for the audience to get it because everything was clearly written all over her plaintive face.

The soundtrack music was incredibly penetrating. I don't know if it was original music for this movie but it sure sounded like a perfect fit. BTW the song included on the soundtrack is ""Come Saturday Morning"" by The Sandpippers. According to Wikipedia the song peaked at #17 in 1970. And, it is available on this&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CD/dp/B000006OM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CD</a>.

""The Sterile Cuckoo"" tells me so much. Not blatantly or overtly because both Jerry and even Pookie were more or less introverted when it came to sharing their true emotions and feelings. Sure, Pookie could run around and act like a clown because that was a lot easier than letting society meet that scared and insecure person that lived within her body and mind. You have to read between the lines though and everything is as plain as night.

There must have been a very pronounced part of Pookie that probably felt unloved and incomplete because she saw the world so differently. Everyone around her was weird and strange. I think that was her way of putting up a wall because she didn't know how to allow anyone into her world because deep down she knew that she was the oddball. She finally let Jerry see her like no one else ever did before. And he said he loved her. But did he really? Do any of them love any of us that much? Or do they just want to feel a warm body and hear a heartbeat?",1223596800,5,4277,4.709893048128342
1207351,2,B00000FB1U,"Despite it's Oscar nomination this movie bombed at the box office and for good reason.  The plot has little substance, is slow paced and ends with a big ""yawn"".  The story centers around (Pookie) a pathetically insecure college freshman determined to lose her virginity to the first boy she meets (Jerry).  Upon Jerry's rejection, Pookie assumes the role of a lying psychotic stalker to eventually get him in bed.  Her success is short lived however because Jerry is obviously more interested in his hunky roommate (Charlie).  Pookie and Jerry's relationship dies on the vine as quickly as it had started.  Jerry goes on with his life while Pookie falls into a creepy mental depression. Ironically, Pookies feels that everyone is a ""weirdo"" except for herself.  There is no real ending to this movie, it just stops and the credits being to roll.
As bad as the movie was, Liza did a wonderful job acting. She was 22 at the time and campaigned hard for this roll. She gave up a lead part on Broadway and put her concert schedule on hold for this film.  Unfortunately, her superb acting wasn't enough to save the movie. Fortunately, they decided not to make a sequel.",1201737600,9,1164,4.727722772277228
1207352,5,B00000FB1U,"This lovely, heartwrenching film is the sort of story that just doesn't get told today -- perhaps the innocence & honesty required just isn't there any longer. More's the pity, because this is a beautifully tender story of first love & its inevitable ending, which deserves to be seen. Liza Minnelli is unafraid to play the eccentric, lonely Pookie as needy & infuriating when required. Yet we never lose our sympathy for her, especially as we realize that Wendell Burton's shy, introverted Jerry is gradually outgrowing her. She's exactly what he needed to break out of his shell, and he clearly understands this ... but he sees that they're destined to go different ways before she does (or before she'll admit it to herself). Minnelli & Burton are superb together, utterly convincing in their wistful, somewhat lost, always searching way. And Tim McIntire's supporting performance as Jerry's boastful roommate, who surprises us with a heartfelt confession on a night drive home, is a small gem in its own right. ""Come Saturday Morning"" is the perfect song for this small but deeply affecting story of first love, lingering in the memory along with the characters. Highly recommended!

But two stand out and are the best in the film.  The scene where Pookie and Jerry are going to have sex for the first time is sweet and honest and absolutely hysterical.  Liza's telephone scene ranks up there with Louise Rainer's in ""The Great Ziegfeld""  and Barbra Streisand's in ""The Way We Were"".  It will tug at your heart strings like no other scene in any movie in recent years.  Liza should have beat out Maggie Smith for the OSCAR for this one for which she was nominated.

He was such a nice person even as he realized his mistake in getting involved with her and trying to extricate himself from her. It was well acted since I felt I was watching real people.
I recently saw this movie listed on TV. I decided to watch it again since sometimes I change my mind about a movie after time has passed. Unfortunately, not true here. I still did not enjoy it for the exact same reasons.
