Now, during their one year of high school together, Ted will realize there are troubling aspects to Truck and his party-hardy gang, The Kings. Bravo, Bravo, Bravo. Ted is a Freshman and Ted wants desperately to have his brothers acceptance and that of his friends. What a Wonderful movie, Wonderful actors, Wonderful dialog....Wonderful, moving stirring....you name the adjective and it fits.  If you love a good story here is a movie for you. Alex Frost as Truck and Lroenzo James Henrie as Ted (Bug) are magnificent. The story is compelling and the support cast is superb. Do you get the impression that I love this movie. I won't tell you the particulars of the story of Ted, Truck and the Kings but it is shocking and still has heart.",1459209600,,887,4.72258064516129

8520766,3,B007PWNV6G,Honesty a very good movie throughout the whole picture. your really into it and all there's so much going on and it flies by for 3/4s of the picture. they leave alot out though they don't explain little things and also the ending completely ruined the movie for me. awful awful ending makes no sense at all and leaves multiple things unexplained. otherwise the every thing leading up to the ending was good.,1401926400,,407,4.589041095890411
8520767,3,B007PWNV6G,"Definitely for the younger crowd. Almost Kings is no different than many good films dealing with the subject of peer pressure, sexual encounters, and all the rest that entails being a young person these days. The acting is not too shabby, and I would assume many in the audience that it belongs to, might learn a good lesson or two in a critical moment, specially the one where some compromise who they are for the avid desire to belong, in this case to the kings.
After a while, we felt that perhaps the subject matter was below our pay grade, or to be more blunt still, our emotional IQ considering none watching the movie was under 30. Wrong selection of an otherwise decent movie, that might mean more to a certain demographic than the one the took the plunge. So many choices, once in a while a slip of this kind is understandable, but will leave the teen dilemmas for its rightful audience. 3.5 Stars.",1401494400,,907,4.503030303030303
8520768,5,B007PWNV6G,"If you read the book, this movie follows it down to the dialogue.  I loved it! It was a really sad movie but the plot and acting were superb.",1344556800,4,141,3.8620689655172415
8520769,5,B007PWNV6G,"I viewed this feature at the 2010 LA Film Festival and am excited that it's now available to watch again! As someone who works with teenagers, this movie is about as authentic as a teen-coming-of-age movie gets.  ""Almost Kings"" rings true to teen life throughout, from the brotherly banter, to the high school hierarchy, to the desperate need for identity and belonging. It also doesn't hurt that the casting and resulting acting is top-notch; Lorenzo James Henrie delivers his role as Bug in a quiet way that is both endearing and mysterious.  If you want to see a movie that dumbs down our youth in predictable ways, then don't bother here. But, if you want a genuine and rich movie experience that will connect you to today's youth, then don't miss AK. Films like these just don't come around that often.",1337644800,7,807,4.716312056737588
8520770,5,B007PWNV6G,"Almost Kings made the festival circuit rounds in 2011 and was one of the best American independent films I'd seen the entire year. The script, by director Philip G. Flores and Max Doty, which won the Netflix ""Find Your Voice Competition"" is compelling, and though it's hard to pinpoint, there's something in the DNA of Almost Kings that makes us feel like we've not seen a coming of age story quite like this.  Strong performances from its cast, particularly Portia Doubleday, Billy Campbell (The Killing) and Lorenzo James Henrie, combined with gorgeous cinematography make Almost Kings hard to ignore, even when you'd rather look away. Don't miss it!",1337472000,5,652,5.037037037037037
