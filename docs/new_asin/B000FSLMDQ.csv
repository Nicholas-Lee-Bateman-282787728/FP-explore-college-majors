The disk and my DVD player will not remedy this issue and this movie is a ""silent"" film for me.  If your a Toshiro fan I still recommend it highly.",1236038400,16,314,4.571428571428571

8126131,5,B000FSLMDQ,"Toshiro Mifune is well-known to any fans of Japanese films, and is probably one of the greatest actors of all times.  He is best known for his collaborations with Akira Kurosawa, including ""The Seven Samurai"" which is arguably on of the finest films ever made.

This box set collects five of lesser known Samurai films, made with a directors Kihachi Okamoto and Hiroshi Inagaki, both masters of the genre.  It is a good deal for the price, which would cost considerably more if buying all the DVDs individually.  Anyone looking to add five great films to their collection at a good price will find this box set a treasure.

The films in this set include: (Note that many of these films carry different translations for the original Japanese titles.  These are the titles as currently available for their individual DVD releases)

""Samurai Assasin"" - Director Kihachi Okamoto - Based on an actual historical event, Mifune is Niiro Tsuruchiyo, a ronin who makes a last bid at greatness by joining in a plot to assassinate a Shogunate elder.  A dense, political piece, it is heavy on dialog and short on action, but is considered on of Mifune's greatest acting roles.

""Incident at Blood Pass"" - Director Hiroshi Inagaki  - One of the two non-Kurosawa films where Mifune portrays the ""Yojimbo"" character, this time he is a bodyguard drawn into a multi-leveled contest with betrayal at every stage.  Co-staring Shintaro Katsu in a break from his famous Zatoichi character.

""Zatoichi Meets Yojimbo"" - Director Kihachi Okamoto - The 20th film in the ""Zatoichi"" series, this film also features Mifune in the ""Yojimbo"" character, this time facing off against Shintaro Katsu's blind warrior Zatoichi.  Truly a meeting of giants.

""Samurai Banners"" - Director Hiroshi Inagaki - Mifune is Kansuke Yamamoto, one of the greatest generals of Takeda@Shingen. A great big epic, this film is full of brilliant costumes and massed samurai battles.

""Red Lion"" - Director Kihachi Okamoto - Mifune is a poor servant who impersonates an Imperial Army Officer by wearing his Red Lion mane helmet.  Quickly caught in a web of his own lies, Mifune must navigate his way to prosperity and safety.",1156636800,102,2172,4.958563535911602
