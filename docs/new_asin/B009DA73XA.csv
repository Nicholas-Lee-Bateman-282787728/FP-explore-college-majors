5319473,5,B009DA73XA,I enjoyed the series a lot but some of the smaller stories were not carried well (being a German spy).,1380758400,,102,4.15
5319474,4,B009DA73XA,Good movie to view the background of the birth of the Titanic. It gives you a different perspective of the Titanic story.,1380672000,5,121,4.545454545454546
5319475,5,B009DA73XA,This is a docu-drama that focuses on the building of the ship along with all that goes with it. It's definitely a different perspective. If you are into the Titanic you owe it to yourself to watch this a few times.,1376784000,3,214,4.2439024390243905
5319476,3,B009DA73XA,"Titanic Birth of a legend was ok. The reason I gave it 3 stars: I had hoped ithat it was ""more"" of a documentary with some original pictures of the Titanic like photos of the boiler rooms , staterooms and steerage class accomedations and Harland& Wolfe shipyard  where the Titanic was build.",1367452800,,291,4.596153846153846
5319477,3,B009DA73XA,"liked the background story on the building of the titanic. it makes the fictional ""Titanic"" more interesting. the acting of both male and female leads were boring. derek jacobi made the movie worthwhile to look at. the ending doesn't even show the ""end"" of the titanic passengers.",1361577600,,280,4.9787234042553195
5319478,5,B009DA73XA,"is a pretty awesome docu-drama, you see stuff in a different perspective. this one is more about the people that work on constructing the Titanic before her final days.",1361232000,,168,4.827586206896552
5319479,5,B009DA73XA,I have always been a Titanic fan. So naturally how it was constructed appealed to me. This was an excellent documentary.,1357344000,11,120,4.761904761904762
5319480,5,B009DA73XA,"This docu-drama is far better than the fictional miniseries along the same lines, ""Titanic: Blood and Steel.""  The docu-drama has been edited much more closely and has a tight-knit pace to it.  ""Titanic: Blood and Steel,"" on the other hand, is a ponderous soap opera dominated by endless bickering and unpleasantness.  Both productions show how the labor and political unrest in Belfast influenced building of the ship and perhaps lent to its faulty completion.  Nevertheless, the docu-drama, masterfully narrated by Charles Dance, tells us the story without the use of characters who either didn't exist or whose fate we don't care about.

Each of the good documentaries on Titanic seems to give us information and clues to the ship's sinking that we may not have heard about before.  ""Titanic: Birth of a Legend"" is no exception in this regard.  Lord Pirrie was the head of Harlan & Wolf, Titanic's ship builder.  Apparently, he above anyone else was responsible for the decision to limit the number of lifeboats to 16, rather than the 64 recommended by the ship's first designer.  To his credit, the designer resigned over this decision despite having worked for the company over 30 years.  Lord Pirrie also advocated home rule for Ireland which became his undoing.  He had to flee to England in order to escape angry mobs who wanted to keep Ireland fully part of the United Kingdom.  Lord Pirrie, as the story goes, never saw the completed Titanic set sail and when it sank his fortunes went down with it.

This 2005 docu-drama only runs 75 minutes, in contrast to the many hours one must invest in watching ""Titanic: Blood and Steel.""  Much better to get this docu-drama and match it to James Cameron's 1997 blockbuster, ""Titanic,"" for a comprehensive look at what happened with the great ship and why it was doomed to sink.  Other fictional supplements might include ""A Night to Remember"" and the 1953 movie, ""Titanic,"" starring Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck.",1355270400,23,1969,4.924242424242424
8540184,2,B009DA73XA,"This disc is destined for the depths of a trash heap.  Poor quality... skips, freezes. It's going back.",1511740800,,103,4.722222222222222
8540185,5,B009DA73XA,great!!!,1503964800,,8,8.0
8540186,5,B009DA73XA,"If you really want to know the full background of the Titanic saga you really need to go back to her birth place. Belfast Ireland and the shipyard Harland and Wolff. And this DVD tells you all about her conception, birth, construction, launch, fitting out, and sea trials and the men who built her.
I've seen this before on youtube and again on TV but didn't know you could get it on DVD so when I found it I jumped at it. Only slight inaccuracy in this and that was Thomas Andrew's was onboard Olympic for her Maiden voyage not at the shipyard overseeing Titanic's fitting out.",1469923200,,578,4.411214953271028
8540187,5,B009DA73XA,"Absolutely Loved this film!! Although, would've like to listen to the American version as well, but this English version is very well done, nonetheless! Awesome!! :D",1468022400,,165,5.384615384615385
