3659802,5,B001JV5BAS,I have only caught on to Benny Hill in the last year (2012) on PBS.  Bought the DVD and am very happy with it.  He sure was a genius at comedy.,1359504000,,143,3.5806451612903225

3659804,4,B001JV5BAS,Given as present Receiver said she really liked even if she had seen some of the skits before. Really thinks Benny Hill is funny,1349827200,,128,4.375
3659805,1,B001JV5BAS,Very disappointed in this DVD. I watched all of his programs years ago and had alot of laughs. I found this disc did not provide the material he was so famous for,1244937600,8,162,4.09375

3659807,4,B001JV5BAS,"This brought back many memories and more than a few laughs for me from growing up in England in the 70's and 80's
Picture and sound quality are not the best, but considering the age of the material I wasn't expecting HiDef.
Not really the ""best"" of Benny Hill in my view, it wouldn't be possible to condense 30 years on television into an 87 minute DVD, but you certainly get a flavor of his material, and talent.
I suppose you could term The Benny Hill Show, an amalgam of slapstick, burlesque and double entendres in a format that included live comedy and filmed segments, and the selection on this DVD represents most of that.
Some of the material has aged better than others, and for a US audience some of the ""British"" aspects of the comedic value may be lost.
I purchased this for $5, and it is often available from aftermarket sellers for as little as this.
If you're a fan and want a walk down memory lane, or if you just wanted to know what people are talking about when they wax lyrical about the old days and Benny Hill, then this is a good place to start.
Features a couple of classic ""run off"" sketches to the familiar tune of Boots Randolph's ""Yakety Sax"", which is so strongly associated to the show that it is commonly referred to as ""The Benny Hill Theme"" - you can Google it!",1476403200,4,1293,4.347107438016529

3659809,4,B001JV5BAS,"I grew up watching Benny Hill on American television. I find it a little easier to understand Benny Hill now than I did then. This disc is just a small fraction of Hill's career. Yet you can see his astonishing talent in each vignette. His songwriting skills, his many ridiculous characters, his charisma are all on display. If you've never experienced Benny Hill's comedy before, this is a pretty good place to start.",1471824000,3,418,4.739726027397261

3659827,5,B001JV5BAS,"The Best of Benny Hill is a very funny overview of his long running show. It highlights some of the best excerpts and skits compiled over the early years. We thoroughly enjoyed it. It's hilarious, and illustrates just how ingenious Benny Hill was. It's such a tight production, that it was like actually watching one show, but you know that its really a compilation of some of Benny's best performances. Loved it !",1435104000,,414,4.684931506849315

Growing up I saw Benny Hill prior to my military years: '69-'91. I felt this was a good place to open a scrapbook, as-it-were.
The show contains slapstick; burlesque; live, and filmed skits. This DVD captures what it CAN in 90-minutes. Some of the
collected bits-and-pieces require an Englander-slant to appreciate; other stuff just didn't age well. It's NOT wine, it's Benny
Hill: you like that ""Yakety Sax"" song by Boots Randolph... or you will like this even less.
As an OLD [I'm 68] fan, I wanted a stroll down memory lane; this gave me a taste, and I'll pick out MORE... some stuff is
really funny some, really....not.",1496966400,,1037,4.550802139037433
