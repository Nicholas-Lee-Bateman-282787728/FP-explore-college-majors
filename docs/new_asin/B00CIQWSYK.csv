8582159,5,B00CIQWSYK,"I purchased this item so I can prepare for the IM exam, and I'm already loving this set! And just so you know, ALL my discs worked perfectly fine with no flaws. The syllabus came in perfectly packaged and in mint condition. So far I'm already about half way through the entire book. I recommended this for anyone preparing for the medical field. Tons of valuable information. This item came with a 90 day money back guaranteed. So your defiantly will get your moneys worth!",1390521600,,473,4.576470588235294
8582160,3,B00CIQWSYK,"Unfortunately I bought this from amazon for the same price as buying from Medstudy. Why did I do this? It was an impulse. You know when you look at something so long and then just finally pull the trigger on buying it?
A few of the discs are damaged and skip. Unfortunately there is so much material to cover that I didn't figure this out until after the date which it could be returned. *sigh* It doesn't appear to be a bad copy. It seems to be from Medstudy given how it was sealed, so maybe if you get them from Medstudy it's the same.
The content is good though.",1388361600,,566,4.154545454545454
