8138005,5,B000HBL25E,"It's true; the interview contained on this DVD ain't the best, but only because Charlie Rose is in over his head with our man Noam.  However, it is worth a laugh, if you find the idea of watching ol' Charlie grasping at straws (oh, the way his face just plummets when Chomsky corrects him on the subject of exactly how many political parties are operating in American government!) amusing, then this disc is for you.  However, it is way over-priced, making its availability on YouTube all the more attractive, unless you want this video for a classroom.

By the by, it is the typical language of the overfed to refer to any views not wholly in support of either America or Israel as either anti-American or anti-Semitic.  Both assertions are false, rooted in the very narrow-mindedness they claim to despise, and plague more than a few people who are satisfied with the current balance of world power.",1207094400,3,901,4.719745222929936
8138006,1,B000HBL25E,"Chomsky tries to appear as mild- mannered and reasonable. But at the end of the interview when Rose dares to question one of Chomsky's absurdities in which he claims that the U.S. really did not wish to dislodge Saddam Hussein Chomsky's true one- track pedantic fanatic character is revealed. He changes the subject and begins using the word 'Wolfowitz' as key- word for evil. This is the only time in the interview when he does not get away completely with turning the truth completely on its head.
Earlier in the interview Chomsky gets away easily with palpable falsehoods. He claims that Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 in order to allow Palestinian terrorism from Lebanon to continue so that Israel would not have to make a peace settlment. As one who lived in Israel at the time and knows how the whole operation was directed against Palestinian terrorism the absurdity cries out to high heaven.
Chomsky has this Stalinist method of systematically distorting the truth and fitting it into his own hateful anti- American view of the world. Instead of challenging Chomsky Rose by and large nods his head. He even tries to flatter Chomsky by expressing his admiration at Chomsky's vast 'knowledge' this for Chomsky's saying something about politics in Brazil. Sickening.
This interview illustrates the limitations of Rose's 'the interviewee is my friend' approach. That approach can work in many cases. But when one is facing a controversial figure like Chomsky an interviewer should be tough, and courageous.
Rose however tells Chomsky that there is so much to talk about he just has to have another show to hear more.
The pits.",1194048000,,1630,4.9743589743589745
8138007,3,B000HBL25E,Well as usual Chomsky has the answers and history to back up his view of the world. What I did not like was the scattered and seemingly random topics that Mr. Rose would bring up without discussion. Mr. Rose admittedly interrupted and changed topics over and over in a way that I found distracting. Each topic is important and should have had debate. Instead of Debate Mr. Rose would just change the topic. Annoying to say the least it was like someone asking you a question and then before you could answer ask another unrelated one as if not listening to the answer. Did Mr. Rose do his homework? Did he research and plan this valuable time with Chomsky? I realize time was short but to try and fit in the huge amount of random topics instead of narrowing the focus for a great show left me unsatisfied. The only thing about this program that is good is Chomsky was full of facts and history and that is why you should purchase this program. I have never seen Charlie Rose in action before so if this incomplete and unfocused discussion is any indication of his style I probably will not again. What I really like about Chomsky is he is not trying to change your mind but to inform and create speculation. Lets face it people like Chomsky have the knowledge and the capability to articulate and enlighten people. This alone gets more people to take interest in our troubled world even if you agree with him or not.... and that is a good thing. I just wish James Lipton of the Actor's Studio interviewed Chomsky and not Mr. Rose at least Mr. Lipton does his homework and stays to a plan that works.,1163030400,5,1599,4.442176870748299
