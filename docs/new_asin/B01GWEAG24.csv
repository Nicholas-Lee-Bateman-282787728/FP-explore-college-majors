8764246,5,B01GWEAG24,"In Brujas mgicas (Lovely Witches from 1981, and directed by the one and only Mariano Ozores), one has yet another perfect example of the Spanish ""sex comedy,"" by the ""grand-daddy"" of the Spanish sex-comedy himself; Mariano Ozores. In this send-up of the Spanish Inquisition, one gets plenty of bawdy humor (just like the British and Italians, the Spanish are also very good with ""puns,"" ""double entendre,"" and phrases), and lovely female beauties (of the natural kind, I should add), who spare no time in disrobing for the camera! The lovely beauties; whom show us their natural attributes are: the young and beautiful, Azucena Hernndez, Pilar Alcn, Mara Casal, and Alexia Loreto, whose generous but firm posterior, will have you salivating faster than dementia (....yikes....)!! But then again, ""Don Ozores,"" always hand-picked and selected most of the female cast in his own productions himself. Special mention must be made of the always funny and hilarious Antonio Ozores (brother of Mariano), whose timing and delivery were always ""on cue."" He was almost like a Spanish version of Milton Berle!

Now, it goes without saying, but if you don't speak Spanish, you'll be wasting your time, unless of course, you just wanted to ""ogle"" some fine looking nude ladies, and I don't think anyone will fault you for that, at least, I wouldn't!! And, please keep in mind, that this is a ""sex comedy,"" so if you're looking for something that's ""intellectually stimulating,"" go spend the night with Dr. Stephen Hawking for God's sake!

BTW: I consulted with the world renowned, Dr. Karl Von Leckendiegrossenhaarigemuschiundstrucher,  who is something of an expert and authority in the field of the ""Euro sex-comedy,"" and just plain expert in anything to do with natural and sensuous ""female beauty,"" and he rated this one a 5, on the ""peter meter"" scale (....yikes....)!

The DVD picture and sound quality is excellent. DeAPlaneta Home Entertainment is doing a thoroughly fine job, in fully restoring and re-releasing many of these forgotten and long neglected iconic film-comedies, that were once part of a thriving Spanish ""popular subculture."" PAL format, Spanish (no English subtitles), FFN, NR, 83 mins. (BTW: I purchased the DVD through Amazon.es for 15 euros.)

Love and Peace,
