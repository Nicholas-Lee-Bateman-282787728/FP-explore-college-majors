2397176,5,B000AYEITU,"I forgot how much good material they turned out...in particular, the 2nd season would have to rate as their best for me, so if you only buy one of their seasons, go with Season 2...By Seasons 4 & 5 they were getting more experimental and expanding the logic and length of their pieces, which is more toward's Bruce's writing (sausages, wigs, etc.)...less funny, but more cinematic in nature...Season 1 was basically sketches in front of a live studio audience, and not much planned in a television-show sort of mentality...I know these thoughts are somewhat random in order, but hey, that's how I watched the boxed set...",1171929600,5,621,4.867924528301887
2397177,5,B000AYEITU,"There really isn't much that needs saying. The Kids in the Hall are best ensemble comedy group to ever come out of North America. It's a real treat to see the shows as they were originally broadcast in Canada. Aside from the regular episodes there are two ""best of "" compilations on disk four, both with very interesting and amusing commentary from the performers. There is also footage of a live performance that pre dates their television program.

Any Kids fan will want to own this and every other Season Set.",1140652800,6,513,4.637362637362638
2397178,4,B000AYEITU,"The thrust of my thoughts regarding this season are as follows--there are many episodes/skits that are so witty and absurd that I reacted not with laughter, but with more of a ""hmm, that is insanely clever."" With the first and, in particular, the second seasons, this was not so much the case. I found myself 'enjoying' these first two seasons in a much more 'traditional' way--of course, this word really doesn't have any business in association with 'The Kids in the Hall,' but there it is. Very funny, but a tad too cerebral at times to be laughed at instead of 'appreciated.' There are, of course, some very classic bits, as well as some that are new and already beloved by me, such as Dave Foley's bits about himself. Basically--glad to own it, hope that it 'hits me' more on second viewing.",1135814400,3,796,4.612676056338028
2397179,5,B000AYEITU,KITH are one of the best comedy troups in the history of comedy....saturday night live has nothing on the Kids..... It seems as though they learned much from SCTV and in turn have heavilly influenced the Upright Citizens Brigade...... This is a classic season for Bruce.......just buy it u freaks,1130976000,5,296,4.94
2397180,5,B000AYEITU,"While some considered the 2nd season to be perhaps as funny but slightly less daring than the 1st, this time around everything seems to work perfectly. The concepts are as bold as ever, the insights at times are biting and cynical, the concepts are hilariously absurd yet often executed with nuance (a tough feat) and the boys just seem to have found the perfect chemistry. Their intelligent brand of oddball sketch comedy is now fully mastered coming off smoother than before while thankfully never losing the raw edge of the earlier work.

The 4-disc format of the package remains exactly the same as the first 2 seasons with the actor commentary, compilations of favorite sketches, rare never-seen performances from the Rivoli Theater and cast bios alongside all of the episodes. It's a very solid set of added material though not a total home run in terms of extras; however it's what we've come to expect for the series at this point and the consistency is fine.

Obviously this is a must for fans and I think you'll find this to be the most enjoyable of the 3 sets so far. For newcomers I think this is an easier place to dip into the weird world of KITH since the entire act is a bit more polished.",1126742400,25,1205,4.574074074074074
2397214,5,B000AYEITU,"I bought this show for my moms birthday and she can't stop watching it! She watches it every day and has even met dave foley. Over all this season is by far her favorite, and we own every single one.",1364428800,,199,4.0
2397215,5,B000AYEITU,"I enjoyed this season as usual . The case and sketches are well done.
Recommended

If anyone has any questions about this please don't be afraid to ask me. I'd be more than happy to answer any and all of them.",1362700800,,209,4.097560975609756
2397216,4,B000AYEITU,"I'm crushing your head!!!! So good, worth buying. Nothing but good to say. Worth checking out! No complaints. Buy it! Nothing much else to say.",1358553600,,143,4.76
2397217,5,B000AYEITU,"Just wait, the day is coming when someone who is much smarter, richer and better looking.  And they will say ""Like in that 'Kids in the hall?'""  And you will just have to sit there looking stupid.  And I mean REALLY STUPID.  Can you afford to look that stupid.  But seriously.  No, if you do not collect this series.  Your just stupid.",1262649600,,335,4.306451612903226
2397218,5,B000AYEITU,"I am watching this as I type this right now for the second time.  Being a huge fan of the comedy troupe I can't say anything bad about this dvd.  Even though I know what to expect from memorizing their sketches I find myself laughing so hard I shake the bed.  As their season progresses they get bolder with their comedy.  Their comedy is one of a kind, very very original.  With season 3 you get chicken lady and the bearded lady drinking at the male dance bar blowing her feathers over rooster boy, you get the introduction and slaying of the flying pig, Kevin McDonald in a very revealing bathing suit. I highly recommend this dvd because everytime you watch it you will be laughing hysterically.",1255046400,,699,4.47244094488189
2397219,4,B000AYEITU,"Defintely worth a purchase for those folks who find SNL a little on the obvious side. If your tastes are dry and extremely dark, this is the sketch comedy troupe for you! Classic Gavin, Gordon & Fran, Geralds sketches inside.",1246233600,,225,4.65
2397220,5,B000AYEITU,"Having just revisited the third season of Kids In The Hall again after many years had passed, it just makes me miss these guys even more. Caught them on their most recent (and hilarious) live reunion tour as well as the previous one. Many outstanding sketches abound in this consistently funny third season and it's clear that they were at their best when they clearly pooled their resources for truly original and edgy comedy sketches that still hold up fifteen years later. Not sure we'll see the likes of them again.",1216598400,,519,4.714285714285714
2397221,1,B000AYEITU,"I expected a funnier season. Most of the stories I found boring and annoying. I don't know, maybe I just get older.  KITH were still young and had a lot of freedom to do any stories on any topic. That's cool when you are young. I think season 1,2 were much better. All of them are older now despite that seasons seem still fresh. I wonder if they would still do same episodes or they would cut some of them out now. Mark McKinney is my favorite kid in the hall and it's a fact (though ""It's a fact girl"" segments got on my nerves).",1194912000,,531,4.057142857142857
2397222,5,B000AYEITU,Back when I used to watch the Comedy Channel in the by-gone days of the 90's I had two favorite shows. One was MST3k. The other was The Kids in the Hall. Season three was when they really started to get it right. I've found almost all of my favorite sketches on this collection so far and I couldn't be happier about it! Highly recommended.,1193961600,2,340,4.246153846153846

8080548,3,B000AYEITU,Season 3 is where the Kids start getting weirder and less funny. So if you can buy this cheap go for it.,1450396800,,104,3.772727272727273
