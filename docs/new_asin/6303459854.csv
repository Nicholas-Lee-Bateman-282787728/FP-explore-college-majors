7847781,4,6303459854,"I managed to obtain this tape along with volume 2 for a song, and it has been the bargain of the century.  Our 2-year old son loves to watch the footage of parent/baby animals and birds.  The film quality is a bit old fashioned but the shots are well selected and edited:  there is NO animal getting killed in this video -- a big plus in my opinion.  The narration is informative but kind of goofy, like those nature shows we had in elementary school.  However it's a good tape to have on if you just want something pleasant in the background, and it's not so captivating that one is glued to the TV -- my son can break away and do more productive things, like playing with his toys (unlike when he's in front of Baby Einstein).",1151539200,,728,4.246376811594203
