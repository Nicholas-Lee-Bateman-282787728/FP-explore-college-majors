5374413,5,B009ZWLA2Q,FANTASTIC AND EXACTLY LIKE DESCRIBED!!,1404604800,,38,6.8
5374414,4,B009ZWLA2Q,"I always loved the 1st film ""Basket Case"". Part 2 is a decent followup to the first (with extra humor?!:). Part 3 Just gets pushed as far as the story could go I suppose. All 3 are very interesting with the 1st being the best! Certainly a great Trilogy to add to your collection, I will always be proud to have in my library forever! Are you a (Good) horror film fan? If so then I strongly recommend picking up this inexpensive historical BASKET CASE TRILOGY! .....it's awesome:)",1403481600,6,479,4.454545454545454
5374415,4,B009ZWLA2Q,It came by delivery today.  It got here earlier than expected. It arrived in excellent condition. I've seen the first two: Liked the first one a lot.  Liked the second one ok.  I look forward to seeing how this trilogy ends.  I didn't even know there was a third one until I accidentally discovered this a couple of weeks ago - and immediately ordered the set.  :),1399852800,2,364,4.373134328358209
5374416,5,B009ZWLA2Q,"Love the movie series! Check out Basket case trilogy, if you love B horror movies you'll love these titles .",1391731200,,108,4.45
5374417,5,B009ZWLA2Q,"This is a brilliant set of classic movies, all 3 basket case movies in one beautiful looking steel book all region free too! The picture quality is great especially on the original 1981 version which is uncut too and is practically the same as the import DVD version and has great features too, parts 2 and 3 have no features, this is a nasty and gory set of movies especially the original, all are creepy and have amazing creature make-up effects, a must have for your retro horror collection, well worth the money!!!",1382313600,5,518,4.580645161290323
5374418,5,B009ZWLA2Q,"This is a beautiful set from top to bottom.  My friend found it and bought it from Kim's for $70 (and I would have done the same had they had 2).  The next day, I ordered this set from amazon.co.uk, because, after conversion rates and shipping, it came out to just under $36 dollars.  I suggest you all do that as well, because this set is worth it, and it's worth the 2 weeks wait to save $20.

Seriously, go out and buy this now.  You won't regret it.",1370131200,4,453,4.044943820224719
5374419,3,B009ZWLA2Q,"This was an weird movie.  The guy in this movie carries around a parasitic twin, in a basket, which was removed when younger.  The normal twin cannot do anything without his twin.  Also, they're telepathic, so it just makes this move kind of silly.  I ordered parts two and three, but my DVD player did not recognized the DVDs, so I sent it back.  I think the parasitic twin gets married or something.  Like I said it's silly, but funny to watch.  Very low budget movie.",1427932800,,470,4.395348837209302
5374420,5,B009ZWLA2Q,Basket Case freaked me out! I watch it now and it's janky. Basket Case 2 & 3... That makes me... I've chuckled in my later years. This box set is worth it if you're a fan!,1424822400,,171,3.7777777777777777

5374422,5,B009ZWLA2Q,"These are the most disturbing, hilariously stupid movies known to man. So naturally this is what my brother asked for, for Christmas. The box set is pretty nice, and he was really happy with this. Glad he was happy...good product.",1423612800,,230,4.775
5374423,5,B009ZWLA2Q,Thanks didn't know they made three of them,1422921600,,42,4.375
5374424,5,B009ZWLA2Q,One of the most beautiful steelbooks I have ever seen. The transfers are INCREDIBLE. This trilogy was one of my first introductions to horror as a child! Got it signed by Kevin Van Hentenryck and is a prized possession in my movie collection.,1422835200,,242,4.651162790697675

5374426,5,B009ZWLA2Q,"Being a long time fan of this franchise I was excited to see a special edition Blu Ray steelbook release.
It is not just a ""thrown together"" release to make a quick buck, but rather a definitive BD release with an amazing transfer and great special features.",1416700800,,258,4.51063829787234
5374427,1,B009ZWLA2Q,"I was looking forward to watching these classic movies for Halloween. Shipping was quick however when I tried playing them in my Blu-Ray, they wouldn't play. My Blu-Ray is a Magnavox built 2009. First issue I had with it playing a DVD.",1416528000,,235,4.619047619047619
5374428,5,B009ZWLA2Q,"basket case trilogy on blu-ray (steelbook).
picture is awesome considering the film is pretty low budget but yeah transfer is really great! the case is amazing and all three films are inside on individual discs. its region free and works on my u.s. sony blu-ray player perfectly. totally worth owning.",1405641600,,301,5.04
8545810,3,B009ZWLA2Q,"Basket Case 3 was a real struggle to get through, it's just a crap film in every way. Thankfully I've now finished the Basket Case Trilogy box set but my appreciation for Frank Henenlotter has grown immensely after watching the feature length documentary 'What's In The Basket?' filmed in 2012. He admits BC 3 was a bad movie and takes full responsibility for it. I really appreciated how open, honest and frank he was discussing all the ins & outs of the three movies in that doco.

 It was such an interesting and enjoyable documentary it's probably one of the best 'special feature doco's' I've seen.",1463702400,,603,4.679245283018868
8545811,5,B009ZWLA2Q,Love this collection. Got this from another place but its the same dvd collection. All 3 movies work just fine on my xbox one blu ray player.,1459382400,,141,4.2592592592592595

8545813,3,B009ZWLA2Q,"It doesn't work in any of our DVD players, and I went back and saw that it mentioned that it may not, as it is imported.",1453161600,,120,3.6538461538461537
8545814,3,B009ZWLA2Q,"The art work on this is probably the best Iv seen for a horror steelbook but is it worth $80? Only to a extreme fan of the films. If you can find it cheaper, go that route.  I paid $4.99 for the original Basket Case DVD put out by Something Weird Video and not much more for 2&3. The qualities are good and, to me, these are not the kind of films that scream extras. The problem is these are low budget grindhouse film, especially the 1st one, and I'm not sure they need a Blu Ray upgrade. At least not at this price. You really are paying for the cool new artwork here. If you're not a rabid collector of steelbooks or huge fan of these movies, stick to the DVDs.",1438732800,,664,4.03030303030303

8545817,5,B009ZWLA2Q,"The first time i saw Basket case was on standard dvd over 10 years ago now
i was freaked out for sure, i'm usually a fan of Slasher Horror films like Halloween & Nightmare on elm st, Texas chainsaw massacre etc

well now i've found out U.K. Distributor second sight has released all 3 Basket case films on blu-ray for first time ever
so i bought this 3 Disc blu-ray out of curiosity reasons only not because i'm a Huge fan which i'm not
plus there's also new special features on this 3 Disc blu-ray
so i thought well if i'm going to check out all 3 basket case films & also check out the new extras
then it makes sense to buy this 3 Disc blu-ray set from second sight which is ALL REGIONS, can you believe it.
and i tell you what it has been worth the money for sure, no Doubt about it
Disc 1 has the first Basket case film in 1:33:1 full screen ratio only
apparently writer/Director Frank Henonlotter prefers this 1:33:1 ratio instead of a 1:78:1 widescreen for this first film
so second sight respectfully only added the 1:33:1 ratio only
U.S. blu-ray Image entertainment has both ratio options actually
so i went ahead watched basket case for the first time on blu-ray in many years
and the new HD transfer does look fantastic, very nice sharp & clear picture quality, hardly no Grain or Dirt
being 1:33:1 full screen ratio there are black bars on left & right side of my widescreen TV
well luckily i have screen ratio change button on my remote so i had no problem removing the black bars actually
to make the picture seem Widescreen instead of Full screen which is what i prefer
i don't know if all widescreen TV'S have that option to change the screen ratio, i know mine does.
i cannot say the same for the sound quality, it's only a Master audio stereo mix
Disc 1 also has all the special features old extras from the Image entertainment blu-ray plus new extras aswell
a new 80mins making of Doco- WHAT'S IN THE BASKET which covers all 3 films
the first 30mins is a retrospect on the first Basket case with writer/Director Frank henonlotter, Producer Edgar levins
and Actors kevin Hentenryck, Beverly Bonner and other behind the scenes crew are interviewed aswell
the next 20 mins covers Basket case 2, and the rest of the Doco is about Basket case 3 and the Legacy of all 3 films
very interesting Documentary for sure
all the extras from the Image int' blu-ray have been carried over aswell
Audio commentary by Frank henonlotter, Edgar levins & Beverly Bonner
also rare outtakes & behind the scenes footage filmed during 1980-1981
new Video intro by Frank henonlotter
also 2 theatrical trailers & TV spots, radio spots
Gallery of behind the scenes photos
all this on 1 Blu-ray Disc,incredible!
Disc 2 is the sequel in 1:77:1 ratio, no extras
Disc 3 is the 3rd sequel in the same 1:77:1 ratio, again no new extras
i think the trailers for the sequels are on Disc 1
so second sight decided to put all the special features and trailers, & tv spots, radio spots, behind the scenes Photos on 1 Disc so that's why
basket case 2 & 3 have the exact same HD transfer treatment as Basket case 1, only difference is the screen ratios
which means the picture quality does look sharper & clearer for sure & the sound is stereo mixes only
no 5.1 mix option on either Disc
the packaging is a steelbook, standard blu-ray case packaging was never produced by second sight
so if you love all 3 films but don't like steelbook packaging & prefer standard blu-ray case packaging instead
well bad luck you'll have to buy the steelbook anyway if you want all the content
5 stars for this new blu-ray trilogy, based on lots & lots of special features time to upgrade for sure",1433289600,,3659,4.453055141579732
8545818,5,B009ZWLA2Q,"The artwork for this release is bad ass! It comes with all 3 Basket Cases. I love Basket Case, but 2 and 3 are not that great,but I bought this anyway because of the cool art,and its a steelbook. Make sure you watch Henenlotter's ""Frankenhooker"" and ""Brain Damage"".Those are awesome flicks as well!",1429833600,,298,4.6415094339622645
8545819,4,B009ZWLA2Q,Nothing like good 80s horror movies.,1429315200,,36,5.166666666666667
