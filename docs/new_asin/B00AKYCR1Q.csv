It has a great cast, it is quite funny; but they do tend to step on each other's lines.  For this reason, and simply due to their accents, you will want to get a normal copy of this rather than to download the episodes from somewhere (as they will lack the subtitles).

The language too often disrespects God; but it is not constant, like an HBO or Showtime series.

The subsequent series is also very good. but it is better to view this one first, to know the characters and their backstories.

If you want to get an idea for the humor, there is a clip you can find on YouTube which can be found by searching for the moody's in court.

Two big negatives: (1) each series is one disk of 6 episodes only; and some okay extras.  (2) If you are able to purchase a disk, it will probably not be of the region where you live.  So, you must have a region free DVD player in order to view these.",1515283200,,973,4.08421052631579
