7049779,5,B00UKSXN60,"The film ""Black or White"" is a moving story that drives home that love truly knows no boundaries but the love of a child when it is centered on what is really best for that one little girl, Eloise. Elliot Anderson (Kevin Costner) is the grandfather of Eloise (Jillian Estell) and is suddenly in the position of raising her alone after his wife unexpectedly passes away in an accident. He has loved this young girl all of his life and is also being challenged for custody from her paternal grandmother, Rowena Jeffers (Octavia Spencer) with the aid of her brother, Jeremiah Jeffers (Anthony Mackie). The trouble is that both families deeply love the granddaughter. With Eloise now being torn between the families that she loves who are struggling with their own flaws, things may get complicated in this based on a real events story.

Elliot is a loving and a settled down family sort of man while having a particular maladaptive vice of his own. His family, including his daughter and the mother of Eloise, are caucasian. Because she died while giving birth the child was in her grandparent's care. He can be gruff with an 'interesting' sense of humor and wit, but his adoration of his granddaughter is very clear to see, feel and know. The father of Eloise had been an irresponsible man at that time although his side of the family is deeply rooted and large while also being in love with her and wanting her living with them. While they both have her best intentions at heart, they will not deny their legal claim to her and this does become a battle. This father's family are African American having certain things unfolding throughout that deepen your emotional pull toward a gruff Elliot and Eloise staying a close family. Eloise inevitably goes through changes from being pulled between both her families while we watch her become saddened and swing back and forth from being the loving carefree child to becoming conflicted with their decision and how she should feel toward both of her 'families'. She does truly love them both. While each side does decide to fight for her, they also have to dig deep to explore their own opinions about race and racism along with their stances on the deep and powerful subject and with which family she should belong with. They must all look into understanding the best situation for Eloise first as she is absolutely the heart of the matter and with that comes much understanding and subsequent forgiveness of the pain caused throughout it all.

There is some gorgeously done dialog within this story that is incredibly real, heartfelt, poignant especially by Octavia Spencer and even humorous in places. The families take this to court in front of the sitting Judge who may cause feelings if you are solely looking at her ethnicity that the deck is definitely stacked against Elliot. She is the one to decide the matter of little Eloise. Things get heated and accusations fly about Elliot being a racist, and it appears damaging when it is tossed around a bit much. The father's side of the family begins using tactics of words, viewpoints, and presumptions while the film does succeed in trying to avoid cliches. It could be harmful to them to actually look back at themselves, but they cannot see into their own dysfunctional lives as well as Elliot needs to for his own sake also. There are problems concerning both families including love. Things get moving and the reasons why come out more so when Elliot takes the stand in the case. Just when you believe all the things will swing one way or the other, the facts come out more so towards the end of the story.

There is humorous care included in this film and a strength of character in Elliot and Rowena which is easy to see and appreciate from both. Their love of Eloise takes a giant leap forward in its importance. Writer and director Mike Binder gives us the story of a family for Eloise with a huge amount of heavy emotion. He treats his characters with an obvious ability to forgive, a certain grace, an abundance of grit including all the foibles and the misgivings of imperfect people who are accepting the flaws in their own lives. The film itself is not about the legal battle or the custody so much but about the two assumed different worlds where nothing is ever black or white - but overwhelmingly gray. This is what makes this powerful film so worth the watch.",1428796800,31,4377,4.689206762028609
7049780,5,B00UKSXN60,"Heres an Oscar-worthy performance by Kevin Costner in a fairly subdued and glum role, totally believable, with strengths and weaknesses of character and a situation that would make anyone feel sympathetic toward him.  His acting style in this movie resembles Gary Coopers late stage of acting, with subdued emotion, a wry sense of humor, a lot of heaviness from burdensome experiences, and yet still at heart a decent guy.  In this story, he is suddenly made a widower after his wife dies in a car accident.  He is raising his biracial granddaughter, the product of his daughter who died in childbirth and an irresponsible black man, but the illegitimate fathers black family wants custody over the child.  A protracted court battle results.  There are details about the interfamilial conflicts which continue to unfold through the movie and increase the emotional attachment we have to Costner and his granddaughter.  His granddaughter goes through a drastic change from happy and optimistic to tormented about whether she wants her grandfather (Costner) or her black father more, and her relationship with Costner plays out very powerfully.  There are few movies with as authentic of human interactions through the whole movie as this oneno artificial moments that remind me Im watching a movie, just a lot of real dialogue and realistic plot developments which make me really care about the outcome.  I am pleased to say the ending is truly satisfying.  There were times I really feared it wouldnt be.  I am glad this movie was made because it provides inspiration that things can have good results even if the journey is long and complicated.

As for the title, there is a somewhat political tone to the movie also, in that the black family is determined to use charges of Costners racism against him, even though hes not racist, so that they can gain custody.  They are so blinded by false assumptions about the old white guy vs. the black victim that they don't care what they're doing to Costner, nor see the deep dysfunctionality in their own family.  Complicating it further is the fact that its a black female judge whos hearing and deciding this case.  On the surface, the odds are totally stacked against Costner, and his struggle with drinking his problems away makes the tension even greater.  Youd have to see the movie to find out what happens!  (You could read a synopsis, but its not going to be nearly as powerful as seeing the movie.)

The complexity is admirable in that you don't view Costner or the black family stereotypically.  They each have pros and cons.  It's interesting to hear one of the black people say at some point that if they don't shape up, they'll be proving the stereotypes true.  Kevin Costner was passionate enough about its noble theme of getting along with people who are different from you, that he funded it with his own money.",1426809600,100,2874,4.862422997946612
7049781,4,B00UKSXN60,"The film centers around a court battle for custody between a rich white alcoholic grandfather and a black  crack-head father.  Kevin Costner plays a poorly scripted drunk who loves his granddaughter Eloise (Jillian Estell) and wants the best for her. When his wife dies, he must care for her himself.

For some reason they decide to give us the background information late. His daughter was the mother who died in child birth while dad did time in prison. Octavia Spencer plays the paternal grandmother who feels she is also entitled to custody having a large family on the South Side.

The film is humorous, heartwarming, and gritty as it takes a more realistic view on race and the race card which climaxes near the end as Costner takes the stand. A far more realistic look at race relations than ""Dear White People.""

Terrific cast lead by Costner and Spencer but the two young actors playing Eloise and Duvan are flawless.

While a lot of the legal points in the movie are off-base, I still applaud this film for creating incredibly complex characters and for not using a stereotypical plot. These days, it's rare not to be a biracial family to some extent, and we can probably drop the ""biracial"" tag and just say family. I think the movie makes this point at the end, but the characters have to experience a lot of humility and forgiveness before they reach that conclusion.",1465171200,,501,4.640449438202247

And Jillian Estell who played Eloise thumbs up. Kevin playing the devoted grandfather Elliott has been thru hell and back first his daughter dies at 17 giving birth, Then his wife just a few short years later. And now possibly losing his granddaughter in a custody battle to his granddaughters crack head father and his mother. He turns to drinking to cover the anger and pain. I can imagine this happening in many family's. I don't want to say to much as I said A must see movie. This movie makes you frustrated and sad.

7049942,4,B00UKSXN60,"I personally did not hear about this movie nor any advertisement of it until I saw it at the public library.  Black or White, written and directed by Mike Binder, is an interesting story of not only interpersonal relationships but race and cultural relationships. Oscar Winners, Kevin Costner (Elliott), and Octavia Spencer (Rowena aka Weewee) plays the grandparents of Eloise Anderson (played by Jillian Estell) who lives in two different worlds, black and white.

Each grandparent must decide as to how to raise their grandchild, Eloise.  Elliott is a drunkard attorney that feels challenged due to the loss of both his wife and his daughter (Eloise's mother that died at birth). He despises the connection with Rowena and doesn't want anything to do with her nor her side of the family.  Rowena is the matriarch of her family and doing really well for herself.  She provides not only emotional support but financial support as well for her close-knit and extended family. It is her passion to have Eloise be joined with her and her family.

Elliott and Rowena begins a struggle to determine who has the best interest of Eloise, let the journey begin.",1454025600,,1153,4.917525773195877

7049946,5,B00UKSXN60,"The thing I admire most about this film is how truthfully it portrays the racial divide in this country by not painting it in extreme hues but showing it for the immense gray area that it is.  The custody battle at the heart of the film serves as an appropriate metaphor for the current national mindset. Avoiding clich the complexity of director Mike Binder's script and lack of finger pointing and fairness to all sides present in the narrative is commendable.  If I were to fault the film it would be that after raising so many cogent points and posing so many intriguing questions it wraps things up a little too neatly for my taste.  The ending seemed tacked on like it came from a lesser Shyamalan film than from a compelling social drama.  Regardless, the film is a success on so many levels not the least Kevin Costner's sterling turn as the loving but troubled maternal grandfather that I would be remiss not to give it a virtual wholehearted recommendation. This is not to diminish the work of Octavia Spencer as the fiercely independent paternal grandmother and the rest of the talented ensemble but the power of Costner's performance permeates the film.  Definitely one of last year's overlooked gems.",1453420800,,1213,4.757142857142857

I was expecting to see something way more humorous and I think if I knew exactly what it was I wouldn't have picked this to watch.  3 stars because the trailer seemed somewhat misleading.

7050004,5,B00UKSXN60,"Writer director Mike Binder has created one of more sensitive films dealing with racial issues yet to be made. He has produced a story, directed it with such sensitivity with an outstanding cast that it absolutely serves not only every ward the film industry can give but also the recognition of everyone working for equal rights.  The script is brilliant, rich in humor and pathos, and very, very intelligent.

The synopsis is too brief but offers the flavor of the film: BLACK OR WHITE is the story of a grandfather Elliot (Kevin Costner) who when his wife Carol (Jennifer Ehle) is killed in an automobile accident is suddenly left to care for his beloved granddaughter Eloise (Jillian Estell)  a child born to their daughter impregnated at age 17 by an African American junkie Reggie (Andr Holland): the daughter dies in childbirth and who died in childbirth. When her paternal grandmother Rowena (Octavia Spencer) seeks custody with the help of her brother Jeremiah (Anthony Mackie), the little girl is torn between two families who love her deeply. With the best intentions at heart, both families fight for what they feel is right and are soon forced to confront their true feelings about race, forgiveness, and understanding. Anchored by an all-star cast and based on real events, the movie is a look at two seemingly different worlds, in which nothing is as simple as black or white.

In addition to the brilliant cast listed above there are cameos by some rather extraordinary actors  Paula Newsome (a gifted and rising star who plays the judge), Mpho Koaho who plays Eloises tutor, and Joe Chrest  Elliots attorney partner and best friend.

The film belongs to Costner, Spencer and Estell  and it could not be in stronger hands. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, November 15",1446854400,,1782,4.936454849498328

Not only is he faced with raising his daughter's little girl alone, he is faced with losing custody of her.
The ""other Grandmother"" comes into the picture, with the return of her son, the child's father. She is
hoping her son is ready to step up to the plate and help raise the little one. The Grandmother is a lovely,
caring and wonderful person. Both the individual Grandparents want the very best for the precious child,
but can only see their own point of view. In the play out of this story, I feel justice is done, and most
important, the little girl is reassured she is loved and wanted by both sides of the family.",1442102400,4,731,4.503759398496241

7050177,4,B00UKSXN60,"Kevin Costner stars in a film that presents thought-provoking themes on race particularly differences between Caucasians and African- Americans in the United States.

The story presents a story of a grandfather who is unexpectedly left to care for her granddaughter when his wife suddenly died. He starts to face problems with it as he lacks experience in child care and growing alcoholism. The grandfather starts to face even more problems when the paternal grandmother seeks custody of the child with the help of his brother. With the best intentions for the granddaughter,both families battle in court which brings into the picture themes on race and cultural differences.

While the film definitely provides entertaining with great acting from Costner and Octavia Spencer,too bad that the thought-provoking themes barely scratched the surface as they are being tackled in the film. It basically failed to explore the gray areas involved and took the tackled issues basically just like the film's title: either black or white. Also,the film explored too many themes that a central theme was somewhat forgotten.",1441065600,,1113,5.354285714285714

Him and his wife has been raising her from birth. Then the white Grandmother passes away. Now the Grandaughters other side are wanting her and are going to court over it.

7050311,5,B00UKSXN60,"Very well-written script with believable characters and storyline. The issues portraying racial prejudice and substance abuse were scenes that invite reflection and conversation. The bottom line is that prejudice exists on both sides and addictions destroy lives and relationships. Excellent acting.

7050342,5,B00UKSXN60,"This was a wonderful family movie; heartwarming, tear-jerking, and a slow and steady build up of one white  guy and his 'mixed race' darling little girl and one considerably large black family who thinks this child should be given to her grandmother (and the rest of the family) as  the loss of the young girls mother precipitated a whole new ball game.

I thought somewhere I saw this was a true story or based on a true story but it be true or not it most likely will hit home to other families in this situation.

Suitable for children; even men though I don't know if Kleenex will be involved.

See for yourself! Just sweet and nice predictble maybe but who the hell cares-KEVIN COSTNER...you just can't go wrong!!!...well you could but you won't!",1438819200,2,751,4.574626865671642
7050343,4,B00UKSXN60,It started off a little slow for me. But it caught my attention. I don't really want to give the plot away. But I will say I was able to see both sides of the stories of the families represented. I could sympathize with both. After the movie was done I looked at my husband and told him that is the way our society is now and we need to learn to embrace it. This movie will make you think.

7050350,5,B00UKSXN60,"I am not a movie/book critic, but this is one movie (after watching on Amazon) that I will add to my collection, and purchase for my children ,as it is an awesome movie in mpov.  A movie that I would love to be certain that my grandchildren, and great grandchildren have an opportunity to watch as there is much to be learned/gleaned from movies such as this.
 This movie invoked so many thoughts, feelings and emotions for us (mostly me). Even down to the wire with abusing alcohol as a means of dealing with the death of loved ones.
~Death of a child (done that, still there, never gets any easier for me)
~Racial prejudice..... I refer to John Lennon (Imagine) and Ozzy (Dreamer) for inspiration on that. Yes, I most often find myself relating to a familiar song helps me deal with an emotion (or 10).
~Absolutely LOVED KC comments while he was on the stand/in the hot seat!
 My fav quote from the movie:
  Maybe this guy is NOT an alcoholic; maybe this guy is just a seriously angry MoFer; maybe he is just hipped up on anger.
PLZ watch the movie and realize the context of that statement before posting a personal pov.
Remember I am not a critic, Im a simple human, who understand and knows from experience much of what this movie explains on the big screen.  Great movie in mpov/my opinion.",1438646400,,1296,4.447257383966245

7050406,3,B00UKSXN60,"Having just watched McFarland USA with Costner which I think was a good movie, it was tough for me not to compare the two movies and Costners portrayals a bit.  Costners plays his flawed character well although his portrayal feels a bit more subdued than I expected.  To me though Estill, who played the little girl Eloise, really played her role well.  This is a movie that tries to tell a story that is a shade of gray and not clear cut with everyone involved having some character flaws of their own.  There are some emotional moments but at times the movie feels a bit flat and slow moving and the story failed to really connect me to the characters and pull me at the heartstrings that I expected it to do so.  It almost seemed to me that they tried too hard to be a bit grey in their story at times with the lack of character development that made it feel a bit superficial. Maybe it was because I watched McFarland USA and I am comparing this too much, I don't know.  This is not a bad movie by any means as it is a good family movie that can start a conversation but it does seem to lack something that could make it more.

7050481,4,B00UKSXN60,"Possible spoilers.  Rather than just make a movie about child custody issues the old fashion way, director and writer Mike Binder (""The Upside of Anger"") tosses in generation gaps and race relations into the mix.

Kevin Costner stars as Elliot Anderson, a well to do attorney who has just lost his wife to an automobile accident as the movie opens.  The couple have raised 9 year old Eloise (Jillian Estell) since birth, complications of which killed their 17 year old daughter.  The girl's father, Reggie (Andre Holland), a black man who has been in trouble with the law, is a drug addict, has spent time in jail and has never shown any interest in his daughter.  Reggie's mother, Rowena Jeffers (Oscar winner, Octavia Spencer) now wants shared custody of her granddaughter.  Elliot balks, but also has no clear plan as to how he will continue to raise his granddaughter on his own.

Angry at the world and the cards he's been dealt, Elliot takes up drinking.  You just knew he had to have some vices, otherwise he was just too nice a guy.  The booze, the anger, his child care frustrations and the legal action taken by Rowena and her attorney brother, Jeremiah (Anthony Mackie) are becoming more difficult to face.  Where the film loses me is the fact that Rowena has to even go to court.  She is clearly a caring woman, living in central L. A. with a house full of shirt tail relatives.  And when Elliot visits, he seems to like everyone, and they him.  So what's the beef?  A little time with Grandma Rowena would seem to be an easy accommodation.

When Rowena brings Reggie back into the picture, Elliot balks and prepares for a fight.  He has clearly never gotten over the fact that a then 23 year old, Reggie impregnated his then 17 year old daughter and he was never aware of any of it.  Some of the best scenes are in the courtroom.  In a long scene, Jeremiah questions Elliot about his relationship with black people.  As we begin to squirm, he provides an answer that would seem to be honest from most people's perspective.

The movie is far from perfect.  For one thing it jumps uncomfortably back and forth between being a comedy and being a drama.  The scene where Elliot has to tell Eloise that her grandmother has been killed is just plain uncomfortable.  With custody at issue, couldn't Elliot curtail the drinking?  After all, he's not an alcoholic, he's just mad at the world.  Taken as a whole, there are some strong performances especially Costner and young Jillian.

The Blu ray disc comes with 1080p video resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The presentation is excellent and typical of the great video we see these days on modern films.  Strong color, terrific detail and deep black levels are evident and consistent throughout the film.  Some of the color tone and hues seem a little too Hollywood, eschewing reality but that would be a filmmaker's choice not a problematic transfer.  The audio is excellent as well with a fine DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  This is a film heavy on dialog and it is well presented, mostly centered and up front.  A few scenes like the pool party at Elliot's house provide some excellent surround opportunities.  Not much coming from the .1 as you might expect.  Subtitles are available in Spanish and English SDH.  Extras include a ""making of"" short, a trailer and a couple promos.  Recommended.",1436918400,,3359,4.67235494880546

7050491,3,B00UKSXN60,"This movie is racist. Most of the adult african-american characters are cast in a bad light. Even I, who am often a bigot, was offended by those portrayals. I often was thinking: Who writes this s**t. Why does Costner's character have to be wealthy? Why does he have to be alcoholic? I can see that he might be bitter about his daughter, but with that lovely child being in his life for 10(?) years that feeling has to be damped. That girl is his daughter's - she is his daughter, almost literally. He lost his own child but got her back with Eloise. The acting is very good except for Costner and unfortunately the child actor, who appears to have no acting tutors/coaches at all. I'm not a screenwriter but if asked to do a rewrite or assist in one, this story wouldn't include Costner.",1436832000,,788,4.441379310344828

7050506,5,B00UKSXN60,"A  very tastefully done theme about a sensitive subject. It was more than the name implies. It is more than race dealing with addiction, death of a loved one, parent  and grandparent roles, dysfunctional on both sides of the family. It made you laugh and cry all at the same time. The acting was superb with Kevin Costner and Octavia Spencer as the leading roles. However, the little girl who is the central character the movie pivots around stole the show. Black and White is one of those movies you could actually watch more than once and come away with something new each time.

It did outline the different cultures/heritage of the Caucasian and African American communities, but I think it only touched the surface.  To have those differences is important. One is not better than the other and because of that sometimes it is difficult to mix them.  That is becoming an increasing dilemma as more and more interracial marriages occur, which also is fine. People should be seen as people first and the other parts of them are what they bring to being themselves and to the friendship/relationship.  I suspect the director was timid about going deeper, that it would turn away some of the box office. Occasionally, someone needs to be brave and do it anyway.  Sometimes through movies we can learn what to do in real life less painfully.  Please do watch the movie and keep the conversation going.",1436745600,2,948,4.9

7050520,3,B00UKSXN60,"More like 3.5 stars but this is a very predictable story about two families who only want what is best for their mixed race granddaughter.  Based on true events the story centers mostly on the court case with family services and the home life of the two families.  Performances were good.  No one brings attitude better than Octavia Spenser and the little girl was cute as a button.  I also thought Costner's explanation about race on the stand was good.  At 2 hours, this movie is 30 minutes longer than it needs to be and given that, I still thought the ending was a little rushed or too convenient.  For me, there was too much cussing to call this a family movie.  OK rental but don't bother buying it.",1436572800,,705,4.4186046511627906

7050543,4,B00UKSXN60,"This was a good watch. It exemplifies the roles of racism in the world today as we attempt to come to terms with who we are as a divided people attempting to unite. There remain underlying tensions and assumptions about the diverse groups represented in this film, and I think the film suugests that we all must look deeper.
With that said, I think Costner is an iconic actor, and Octavia Spencer was a good choice for his antagonist. Heis character is not an easy protagonist to like, but they had an excellent on screen dynamic. The mutual respect, and dare I say love, potrayed between them was moving. I do think, however, the plot line falters at the end, and I'm not sure why Spencer's character gives up so easily in court. That is, I felt the climax just didn't reach the power and symbolism it could have. I'm not suggesting an attempt to solve race relations, but an attempt to make the resolution more clear would have been nice.
Overall, I liked this movie.",1436400000,,969,4.511363636363637

Like the judgment of a drug addict from a drunk, both are a problem but one just looks more serious than the other, but both cause damage to family and lives. The other issue that was very well addressed is race, often it is not about race but about life issues but race is brought up. We all know racism still exists on all sides but often people who really are not racist get called racist to win in court issues. This movie talks about family and the human condition and how we could all do better by setting aside of differences and building on our strengths. The cast was wonderful and for once they did what is best for the child. I work in the medical profession and let me tell you that does not always happen and we need more of what is best for our children. I love the honesty of human weakness in this movie.

This basic question becomes more complicated as the viewer learns that both families are deeply flawed. The black grandparent emerges as a strong, stable overachiever, whereas the white grandfather has serious personal problems.  The strength of the film is that what begins as a black or white issue becomes an issue of what is best for the child, regardless of race.",1435536000,2,645,4.944444444444445

I don't think so and I think the movie was trying to get that message across too, even if not completely successful.

As a country we have invested a very large sum of our wealth to foster the change and the return has been very small and it has to get better quickly.  We ALL have to take responsibility for ourselves and not look to someone else or a government program to give us something that we are not educated enough to receive or do not work for other taxpayers moneys.

Costner showed great control and his young star really understood, so much more than her years should support.  She is very talented and has a great future in most anything she tries.

This is about more than just black or white, it is about unbiased love!  As a parent you have no control over who becomes part of your family, question is how do your respond when its not like you wanted it to be?  What are you made of; your morals, your values, your commitment as a parent.
As a person of mixed nationalities this movie spoke to me about the need in me to embrace who I am and be thankful that I had parents and grandparents who were committed to love and care for me. I needed the unity of diversity to be complete.  Olivia Spencer and Kevin Costner did outstanding job of presenting this and the social dilemmas we sometimes find ourselves in...on both sides of the fence!",1433462400,6,859,4.150602409638554

If the script is good, chances are the movie will be good. A sub plot about drinking and rehab is just an excuse to glorify booze. ""Black or white"" is a good trial movie about forgiveness and race.

7050970,2,B00UKSXN60,"This film is waaaaaaaaaaaayyyy over rated!  It was nothing more than a bad made for TV movie with good actors in it.  The plot was trite and predictable, and the characters were one dimensional, which made it quite boring.  I see how they were attempting to address issues related to race and class, but because the film was so full of stereotypes (wealthy Caucasian male vs. poor African American male), it accomplished so little of what it was trying to do.  In fact, the portrayal of the drug addicted, poor, young, Black male, was so prominent in the movie, that it likely set back a few years any societal progress regarding favorable views of young Black men.  In the end the viewer is left with the sense of a feel-good message of 'how lucky this little girl is to be saved from her Black family by this rich White guy,' which not a feel good message at all!!!  The 80's are calling, and they want their racist movie that is made to seem like it's not racist back.",1432944000,3,971,4.426966292134831

I thought this movie was very well done. It managed to tackle real world racial feelings without falling into the 2 common traps most films that do this fall into. It came off as neither preachy nor melodramatic.

The characters come off as real. The story is well written and entertaining.

The only down side is that it's slow. But it's a good movie.

A good effort, with good intentions by all the actors and the director.  However, as a previous reviewer noted, more ""back-story""...like how the daughter ended up 17 and pregnant by a troubled, lost soul would  have added depth.  Also, if the Kevin Costner character could recognized himself as a dysfunctional  addict just like Eloise's father...that would have been a poignant turning point.  He seemed too judgmental without any self-awareness that he had demons like Eloise's father.  Still, it's a decent movie...just wish the ending wasn't so hokey!",1432252800,,699,5.348623853211009

I thought Kevin Costner did an outstanding job in his role as the grandfather of a bi-racial child. He has to learn to become her main caregiver, deal with the emotions of losing his wife, help his granddaughter with her homework, deal with the child's extended family who decide to sue him, and try to cope with his drinking problem, which he denies is a problem. He may have a bit much on his plate most of the time, but he never loses sight of the most important thing: his love for his granddaughter. Octavia Spencer is perfect in her role as the other grandma who just can't keep her mouth shut in the court room. There were a few very emotional scenes, tempered by a number of very funny scenes.

7051262,2,B00UKSXN60,"Good acting but too stereotypical! The white protagonist has a drinking problem, but he gets a pass because he's rich and has gone through much tragedy.  In contrast, the drug addict who is the father of the grandchild will probably always be beyond redemption because he lacks wealth and riches, and by implication   character; and he is coddled by his mother, who is loud-spoken and inappropriate but lovable. For that matter, the whole family sings, dances, and eats through tragedy... And they even hug the white grandfather, who could use some ""sugar"" even though he is an admitted racist.

In court, the character of Kevin Costner gets the sympathy of the audience when he feels he has the right to make racist comments about the father of his grandchild.  I come away from this movie wondering if the majority of white people ever get it right. ( I am a white person)",1431734400,2,874,4.723684210526316

7051277,2,B00UKSXN60,"I really wanted to like this movie.  The trailers made it appear that the movie would be engaging, heartwarming, funny yet telling story on a socially conscious issue.  I was a bit confused from beginning to end.  Perhaps, not watching the movie at such a late hour might have helped.  The movie, while reasonably ""cute"" in a COUPLE of place, served little more than to put me sleep.  There were a couple of spots that truly earned a chuckle (I hate when they put all the funny parts in the trailer and then you don't realize it until you've watched the movie).

We start the movie with the grandmother dying (or dead?) in the hospital. Costner seems particularly detached, so much so, we are not truly invested in the character from the beginning. When he tells the grand daughter, again the scene seems so detached, a lack of genuine emotion.  When I watched this picture I don't see grieving widower, I see awkward drunk. It was also hard to picture a man like (crack-head) like Reggie with Elliot's daughter to create this beautiful child.  Perhaps the movie was so slow, I must have dozed off? And what exactly is cute about a child that wants to be yelled at to brush her teeth? I'm sure that I'm the only one that didn't find her soooo adorable.

What should have been an excellent vehicle for these great stars ended up being a strange movie because there was so little backstory, it was hard to become vested in any characters, or understand the leaps between the storylines and, with periods of such awkwardness, I wanted to look away in embarrassment. I gave it a two out of respect for Octavia Spencer and Kevin Costner.",1431734400,3,1632,4.561643835616438

More about his daughter who died...why she left home, who or what drove her out, why didn't they know she was in labor?

The real issue is how frail we are as human beings when we suffer loss, and whether or not we learn to cope in healthier ways with our loss.

Another theme that resonated with me is the one involving socio-economics and addiction. Some addicts have the luxury of having people around that can help them maintain some since of order until they check into rehab.

Costner's character, Elliot Anderson, did things no good attorney would do, such as give the opposition a large some of money for any reason. He would have know that this syrupy gesture would be interpreted as a bribe, The film simply brushed it aside. There was also no talk of shared custody, which would have been a credible move. The grandmother giving in and handing over total custody was another sappy gesture. The film's attempt to make this a race issue is ridiculous. Anderson's granddaughter is black, but he loves her with all that he has. ""Black or White"" played on emotions and not reality.",1431648000,6,649,4.803571428571429

7051370,5,B00UKSXN60,"Young Eloise never knew her mother . She died the day Eloise was born. Her father is a drug addict, so her Caucasian grandparents raised her from the day their daughter died. Now her Caucasian grandmother is dead and that leaves her grandfather to raise her alone. He is loving and caring, but he is drinking too much. Her African American grandmother wants full custody of Eloise . Eloise's father shows up at the custody battle and a battle it becomes .

As you watch this movie you will ask yourself so many questions. Who has the right to raise Eloise? What needs to be done in the best interest of Eloise now and as she grows up? Can grandparents in two different environments work together to nurture and raise this beautiful child who loved them all?

There are misunderstandings, the lack of forgiveness and then forgiveness, feelings of hopelessness, anger, sorrow, there is redemption, and lots of love. You will see two different family groups who love Eloise. It is a complicated matter, but Eloise knows all along who she wants to live with.

The movie is based on real events. It is an emotional movie and issue, but I think you will come away with a feeling that these family members are going to do what is right for Eloise.

7051443,5,B00UKSXN60,"One of the best movies i have seen this year.  Unlike other critics reviews, Kevin Costner is outstanding and believable.  Also, many of the Amazon Review Critics say that their Black friends are nothing like the ones depicted in the movie.  I feel this is because most of their Black Friends are upper middle class people.  But trust me, their are many more black families who would relate than not.  This is a movie that we all should study and in which should ask us a question about being different culturally in one aspect but having many similarities as humans.  I loved Octavia Spencer having all the kids that lived with her (this happens often in impoverished areas of the city) and yet she was an entrepreneur out of her own garage - we see this often in homes and on city blocks.  As one would say we can see each other as black or white but what comes next afterwards and who do you see, what you appreciate is what counts.  This movie shows that America is a great stew pot with many various distinctions, all of which can add their flavor and yet all being appreciated.  We had an alcoholic, a crack head, rich and poor, yet, all came together to try an solve a crisis for a little girl and in the process started healing each other.",1430956800,,1247,4.386956521739131

7051447,1,B00UKSXN60,"What a dumb movie.  They scapegoated ""Elliot"" for not wanting his grand-daughter to live with her ""other grandmother"".  The grandmother had so many kids living in the house already and a drug addict as a son.  Some parenting skills.  And she ran a full time business.  Like she would be there for the child with all that on her plate?  This was not a movie about race.  This was a movie about class.  Many many african american families have good manners and class.  This portrayal of the african american community did them a disservice.  None of my black friends are like that.  If I met families like that,  white, black, asian, indian, Urdu, whatever...I wouldn't let my kids hang out with them.  C'mon.  Get real.

Rarely does one witness in modern day cinema that, in the end, all characters opted to rise to the occasion and do the absolute correct and loving action while knowing their hard limits.  This is one that questions you really to take a moment and ponder how all of us could really improve our situations if we lead with our hearts/gut and not with our ego/brain.  I hope many more people get the chance to enjoy this GEM, it seems a pity that it was not more broadly viewed while in distribution but with any luck, people will take the time to view it in their own homes!",1430870400,5,736,4.375

A movie, a court case film to put next to films such as Germany Year Zero by Rossellini or Guess Who's Coming to Dinner by Kramer. Mike binder finds here a fertile and exceptionally interesting material to built a beautiful film filled with human dilemmas and questions that matters in today's world.

Costner is once again confirming how excellent of an actor he is and Octavia spencer is exceptionally great (as always) in this film. The scenario studies various path, various options and questions a lot the thin line between prejudices, racism and intolerance.

Smartly written, beautifully shot and definitely trying to stay away from most clichs, the film turns out to be not only an amazing piece of film making but also a mirror to ourselves and our society in the 21st century.

Him and his wife have been raising their granddaughter since she was born, but when her other grandmother Rowena (Spencer) wants custody things get ugly. Elliot must now fight to keep his granddaughter while struggling to put his life back together. I was very much looking forward to watching this movie. I am a huge Kevin Costner fan and the subject hit close to home with me. I have to say that I was not disappointed in this at all, and in some ways it was actually better than I was hoping it would be. The movie is emotional and will make you cry, think and get mad, sometimes all at once. This is really a movie I could just keep going on and on about but that would do the movie a disservice. All I will say about this is that this is a definite must see movie that shows off some of the best acting work Costner has ever done. I really highly recommend this movie.
