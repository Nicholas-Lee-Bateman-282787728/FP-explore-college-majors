However, this movie is about Wang Cong'er, a real-life Chinese heroine who became Supreme Commander of the Nine Armies of the White Lotus, and is the only movie about her I know of. Don't waste your money! Instead, buy the documentary produced by Lucy Lawless. More expensive, but you'll actually learn about this warrior. Google Wang Cong'er and you'll see what I mean.",1360627200,,530,4.760869565217392
