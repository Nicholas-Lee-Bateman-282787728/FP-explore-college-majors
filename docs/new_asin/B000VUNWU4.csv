8220123,5,B000VUNWU4,One of the good DVD's about Escrima.,1435104000,,36,4.285714285714286
8220124,5,B000VUNWU4,"Good fundamentals. However, the narration is a bit odd. I do not think that the man doing the narration is a practitioner. That being said, this series is pretty good. I have taken a few of these techniques and drills and added them to the system of Arnis that I currently study.

8220125,3,B000VUNWU4,"It was very interesting and entertaining, but not as detailed and explained as Volume 1. The Single Stick Disarms were interesting. The Knife Disarms were demonstrated but not explained. That would have helped to fully understand these techniques.",1432512000,,247,5.526315789473684
