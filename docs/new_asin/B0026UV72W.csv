One of the things I dislike about this show is how Sid talks like someone with a developmental disorder. I know there will be overly sensitive people out there who will call me ""rude"", ""insensitive"", whatever, but that's really what it sounds like to me, folks. I really put my foot down when my toddler, who had a very well developed verbal skills, started talking like Sid, with the stutters and inflections, and all - just like Sid. Made me cringe. So, yes, IMO the vocal talent is terrible.

The animation is probably the worst part of the show, however (once again, IMO). Remember when JHC pioneered in puppetry? Long before the days of incessant CGI, we had one lonely crusader in Hollywood who kept the torch lit brightly on how to make live-action characters, instead of falling back on cheap computer graphics. I was floored when I realized this was JHC. Without knowing what's going on, it seems to me the current owners of JHC are merely cashing in on the companies name while putting out sub-par product that pales in comparison to the creative genius it used to be.

Once again, that's just MY opinion folks. Don't get all bent out of shape over it! I know there are many rabid die-hard Sid fans out there who can't help picking fights with people who have anything bad to say about this show. But you need to get over it. Maybe you should all watch the episode about respecting other people's opinions, eh?",1356048000,,1588,4.526132404181185
8353617,2,B0026UV72W,"I bought this, thinking it would be a whole dvd of Sid the Science Kid, which my daughter loves. Instead it turns out that Sid is only the first segment; the rest are different cartoon characters and stories which did not interest my daughter at all. Disappointing.",1350345600,,265,4.659574468085107
8353618,4,B0026UV72W,"I love this show, and the show itself gets 5 stars. It's a great science teaching tool for kids under ~5. My kids love the information and the songs. The format of the show has just enough structure, with transition songs and the right amount of new information for them to learn. The repeated songs are catchy, as are Teacher Susie's clever songs, which are different each show.

Additionally, the characters are all respectful to each other. The kids are respectful of parents, teachers and each other. The adults are respectful of the kids, too, treating them as smart people with important ideas. It's relatively unusual to see a kid in a kid's show interacting with his parents at all. I love that Sid has two parents, who are both supportive, and the dad is not a stereotypical dolt like so many dads on TV. He is sometimes a little goofy for comic relief, but the mom also has a few goofy moments, so it really doesn't come off that the dad is a dolt while everyone else is brilliant. The show makes a point of stating how cool his mom and grandma are, and Sid frequently says how cool his dad is.

So why only 4 stars for this product? The main Sid the Science Kid DVD has four weekday shows. Our PBS station shows those Monday through Thursday, but there is a summary show on Friday. The summary show is not included on this DVD. I'm not sure why not. (Maybe they plan to sell them separately at some point in the future?)

Also, I paid a little extra to get the Front Row Fun DVD for both the Change Happens and the Bug Club DVDs, but the content is identical. I had been hoping to get a different Front Row Fun DVD with each Sid DVD. Front Row Fun contents:

Sid the Science Kid (Charts)
Will & Dewitt
Pocoyo
Word World (one 12 minute episode, not a whole show)
Dive Olly Dive
Animal Atlas
Tiny Planets
Hurray for Huckle
Hopla
Hermie and Friends

Only Sid, Word World and Hermie seemed to hold my kids' attention (ages 2 and 3), but they are familiar with the first two from our PBS station and with Hermie from the books.",1262476800,4,2033,4.339473684210526
8353619,3,B0026UV72W,"My kids seemed to enjoy this DVD, but the science is pretty simple and I find Sid to be a little annoying.",1260316800,,106,3.8636363636363638
8353620,5,B0026UV72W,"Sid the Science Kid is a great way to get your youngest children excited about science. My 4 year old loves the Magic School Bus, but it was a little over the heads of my 2 year olds. Sid was the perfect fit for all 3 kids! The 2 year olds understand what is going on and can follow the program, the 4 year old is learning a ton of new things, and the experiments they do in class we can easily re-create at home for our own scientific endeavours. A great program!",1255651200,3,464,4.0
