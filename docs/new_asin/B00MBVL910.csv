The whole thing is done in a small studio with the performers' friends stuffed around the sides watching.  Have to admit, I had a hard time understanding how some of the spectators could seem so sedate.  The music's awesome.  The extra features were a lot of fun.  Watching JG transport his B3 to the studio, and hearing Ben Elliott affectionately describe his studio equipment, you can't help but admire the professionalism of these two men manifested in devotion to their traditional ""tools of the trade.""

Pick it up.  You'll love it.",1448668800,,700,4.80672268907563
8671562,5,B00MBVL910,Well done DVD on every level. I bought the CD first and now being able to watch these great performances is like icing on the cake. Excellent performances by everyone involved. The bonus features are a nice touch too. I particularly enjoyed the one of John Ginty moving his gear as it gives one a closer look at the man and his personality. Highly recommended!,1447113600,,360,4.553846153846154
