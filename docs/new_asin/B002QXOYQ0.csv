8378124,4,B002QXOYQ0,"This is another challenging ride and pretty ride by Paul Gallas. I am spoiled by Paul's more recent videos, of which he has included some newer features, however it is a challenging ride with beautiful scenery. I will definitely keep it in my collection of great virtual rides to choose from and drip sweat over. Lori",1355616000,,317,4.678571428571429
8378125,4,B002QXOYQ0,"I purchased this last Feb or March when I was using my trainer and BORED to tears with the other ride discs I had.
Behind the bars with Paul, I think he uses BTBOP (fun acronymn) as his unique name is a great ride with fantastic scenery and a real hard core workout if you follow his lead. I would LOVE to know how fast he is going in real time, it has to be 40 plus mph as he rides cautiously up on the tail of a downhill rolling land rover!

I would have given it a 5 star but not until there is a way to synch his kick butt music w/ my iPhone so I can get amped up with full volume music.

I have another BTBOP DVD that is also great but the music on this one is much better.",1350345600,,678,3.701388888888889
8378126,1,B002QXOYQ0,I bought this video to use with my spin bike.  If you are a seasoned rider you might enjoy this. I enjoy the uplifting talk and music and this video did not have that.,1329091200,,167,3.911764705882353
8378127,2,B002QXOYQ0,Used the Carmicheal tapes for a few years and liked them but wanted to vary the workouts so I purchased 2 Paul Gallas tapes. I found them very boring. I guess I like the coach giving me instructions. I will be returning both DVD's.,1327363200,,231,4.2727272727272725
8378128,5,B002QXOYQ0,"I hold you folks completely responsible for my biking addiction.

I am a 66 year old criminal defense attorney and Law Professor in the Chicago Metropolitan area. Though we don't have any mountains (and only a few hills) we do have some impressive-for-the-area Rails to Trails pathways, but lousy weather winters. However, I have a son who has a mountain guide ,skiing, climbing business in Durango, Colorado (Klingmountainguides.com) whom I try to visit at least a couple of time /year. His wife is the HR person at Durango Purgatory Ski Resort. Of passing interest is that when my son Josh, now 30, was 15 he and a group of kids biked from Virginia to Los Angeles which is where we discovered Durango en route.

Through a number of trips to Durango and surrounding areas I began looking on line for biking videos in the region and found you folks. The rest is history. I have either purchased or been given as presents ""Indian to Girdwood,"" ""Evergreen to Red Rocks,"" ""E Rock Rocks,"" ""Training to Climb, Rattlesnake Bite,"" ""Laying Down the Hammer,"" ""Training to Endure, Front Range...."" and ""Bay Area Backroads."" I assure you my orders for the rest of your Colorado and the High Country videos are only a paycheck away.

I hold you completely responsible for my significant diversion from work and family, spending extra money for the videos, not to mention phenomenally better emotional and physical health and outlook and enjoyment of life in an otherwise flat topographically boring environment. I really appreciate your attention to detail, especially enjoy the narrated videos, and look forward to a long relationship. Have a great year.",1327276800,,1643,4.967272727272727

I am absolutely crazy about these videos. I cannot recommend them highly enough. If you ever start riding a bike indoors, get these videos. They truly are the best. They make you feel like you are on the road too. The customer service is above and beyond what you expect. I cannot imagine how hard it is to ride a bike, give instructions, and focus on the rode at the same time. Paul, you are amazing. This is quite a feat. Thank you for taking the time to do this and for risking a lot every time you go out there. Again, this product is incredible. All of the DVDs are wonderful. If you have any interest in riding a bike indoors, or a stationary bike, BUY THEM NOW!",1287705600,2,1140,6.0
8378130,5,B002QXOYQ0,"They didn't call this ""Training to Endure!"" for nothing. This is a tough, long ride through beautiful mountain scenery. I tried it without music this time and still had no trouble staying motivated. There is helpful information on the screen including a navigational map to show you where you've been, where you are, and where you still have left to go. The scenery was still viewable even with the information on the screen. There is an introductory section that you  can watch first to help you interpret all the information on the screen or you can just jump right in and wonder what it all means. I got a great workout and look forward to the next one.",1268265600,3,656,4.559322033898305
8378131,5,B002QXOYQ0,"I have purchased several of the virtual reality videos from ""Behind the Bars with Paul"" and this is one of my favorites.  The workout is plenty long enough, to give me a kick but ride.  The virtual reality of the ride brings you into the ride and you can forget you are not actually out on the road.  The heads up information that is supplied on the screen keeps you honest in your effort and you can make it very real and sweet buckets in doing so.  I would highly recommend any of Paul's videos to anyone wanting a great way to workout or just get in some indoor miles.",1261526400,3,571,4.163636363636364
