5903931,5,B00ECXJC28,"This franchise had such potential and it's incredibly sad that it's been canned. Then again, that's the case with most wonderful and creative television series. The ""Primeval"" production costs had the added burden that the show relied heavily on expensive CGI effects which led to the cancellation of the original BBC series despite a HUGE fan-base worldwide.
My chief confusion is that I've heard so many negative things about Primeval: New World which have no real substance. For one thing, this series takes place in an alternate reality from the original series - an idea which goes back to what happened at the end of Season 1 of the original. In this instance, Professor Cutter returned to a reality where many things were different - including the fact that Claudia Brown had never existed, but an identical doppleganger of her did. In this case, Conner (who only appears in the first and last episodes of the new series) is not necessarily the Conner Temple we know from the original series!
The one thing which brings this series down is the simple fact that we have have not just one cliffhanger (from the original series) but two which are and may forever remain unresolved.
The only other show to compare this one to is probably Doctor Who. This is because the fact of alternate timelines gives a perfect premise for periodically changing the entire cast and even the direction of the story. If an actor wants to leave the show, he or she can be safely killed off because there are probably alternate versions of the same character in alternate timelines which could ""accidentally"" land in the current timeline  - even if it's just for a guest-spot in a single episode. This is a plot-tool as powerful and useful as giving the Doctor the ability to regenerate since it means the series, barring other problems, could continue for a very long time. After all, Doctor Who is not only back from the grave but more popular than ever! I think the same could happen with the Primeval franchise.
By the way, I realize there could be a comparison between Primeval and the original Land of the Lost, yet the only thing they really have in common is dinosaurs in the plot. Land of the Lost is better compared to The Mysterious Island by Jules Verne.
Even though the story is unresolved, I would urge any fans of the original to make this boxed set part of their collection since it really is a well-produced series. The effects are as good as can be expected (by which I mean they are extremely well done) and the story, though complex, does make plenty of sense and would have made more sense if the series had continued. And if anyone complains about the difference in size and coloration of the Pteranadons between the two series, I would remind you that there were probably several species in the genus Pteranadon. And again, alternate realities.
Final comment: if you haven't seen the entire Primeval: New World, you have only got part of the story and really shouldn't comment on lt.",1383091200,6,2991,4.708015267175573
5903932,4,B00ECXJC28,"This show started slowly but ended with a bang. It's really too bad that it got CANCELLED by it's CANADIAN producers! I missed the last (2) episodes when I was in MONTREAL & QUEBEC on vacation. Several of my neighbors raved about the final (2) shows which prompted me to buy the complete first series. Evidently, the SYFY CHANNEL doesn't air discontinued series!",1382486400,11,362,4.761904761904762
5903933,1,B00ECXJC28,"I watched this for a while. I was an ineffective attempt to take a fantastcally  scripted British series and rercreate for the North American audiences.  We who wathched the show know what happened with the anomalys, in fact the guy who shut down the machine causing it all had a first epidode couple a scenes warning the Yank team, Can/USA  I don't know what locale it was supposed to be. Vancouver Or Washtington. As though his appearance lends credibilty to this farce which it dosent. The original series had the advantage of the British Wit and mannerisms and silliness and a great diversity of characters. Some like Danny the former cop were left in the Anomaly and never came back. One fellow who came in the show had a doppelganger that was never explained when the show ended. The producers were told that the special effects were costing too much.  What a shame. But more shamefull is too foist this on us. Just like they took the British Being Human and turned it into a P.C. version of Buffy the Vampire Killer. Dont waste your money on amateur scripts and cheap CGI.",1381708800,2,1079,4.604166666666667

5903936,5,B00ECXJC28,"This show is amazing, I just like the fact that Canada was willing to try to bring back a such a good show as Primeval, and they did a great job with putting their own spin on it. It is a show about dinosaurs coming through ""Time holes"" called anomalies and wreaking havoc on the city and Evan Cross and his team try to send them back to where they came from. I feel bad because just as the show was starting to pick up it got cancelled. But trust me, this show is great and definitely worth a purchase!",1377216000,5,503,4.04

5903938,3,B00ECXJC28,"I loved the original series and was annoyed when it was canceled.  Had high hopes for this one and bought the series and was disappointed and am only on the first disc.  Can't really connect with any of the characters, after the first episode with the pterodactyl and the Utahrapter which I liked it was downhill all the way with creatures I really don't recall seeing in any of my numerous dinosaur books and rather unnecessary gore (original series had some but this one overdoes it).  Was delighted to see an appearance by Connor Temple but that went down the tubes fast - he came off as unconvincing and with all the info (or lack of) he gave wonder why he was even there.

So perhaps the other discs will be better but if they're as disappointing as this one waste of money.",1477180800,,779,4.426573426573427

I loved this series when it was on and if any series deserved a second season it was this one! Hear that SCI Fi! Now, to the issue at hand, This is an Americanized version of the British series, beautifully written by the wonderful team of writers a husband and wife team, the Garfield-Reeves ( Yes that one) It follows the adventures of a group on this side of the pond with  anomalies that open up from different times into our present.

5903944,4,B00ECXJC28,"I'm a huge fan of the ITV original and decided I would take a chance on this series from Canada. While not as engaging as the original I really do enjoy it. I didn't feel the same attachment to the characters in New World, but they are pretty much believable. Connor from the ITV series does make an appearance in the first and last episode but it feels kind of forced and contrived. Otherwise the stories a good, the characters and dialogue are well written. The effects are very believable and that's what is really why we watch these any way. No 'B' movie stuff here.

If you're a fan of the Jurassic Park movies or the ITV Primeval series you will probably enjoy this. I'd give it 5 stars but I think another couple of seasons would have helped it evolve into a truly great show. As it stands it is a great beginning that never got the chance to fully blossom.",1459900800,,864,4.300613496932515

5903956,4,B00ECXJC28,"I like the series a lot and am sad that it was cancelled.  It's a lot more gruesome than the UK Primeval that it spun off from and has a special appearance by the one of the cast of the British show in the beginning.  The stories are intriguing and characters all young sex pots.  If I any complaints about the show at all is the it's youth centric filled with 20-somethings, the females wearing sexy attire.  If you're older and not very good looking at the beginning of the show you are going to get eaten by a dinosaur at some point, it's like the Red Shirts in the original Star Trek--only this time only the youth shall prevail.  It seems that these shows forget that there was an age of giant mammals that ruled the world for millions of years after the dinosaur extinction.  Nothing truly benign ever comes out of an anomaly--unlike the all too cute Rex in the UK version.  Well I'd read that this Primeval was ""darker"" but I think they confuse gore with darkness in the plotlines.  There were plenty of dark story lines in the UK series, but they didn't have to show us anatomically correct mutilated bodies in graphic detail.  I like the show.  I wish they had done an American instead of Canadian version--I don't think the dinos will faire the Canadian winters well considering their environments were tropical for the most part I think and neither did the show, which was too bad because I like it.",1441411200,4,1410,4.45136186770428

5903958,5,B00ECXJC28,"Primeval New World was a remake/continuation of the British tv series, Primeval. I liked Nial Matter from ""Eureka"", so it was fun to see him coping with primeval creatures in America. I liked the British show maybe a teensy bit better, but this new version was very entertaining, and I wish it had not stopped.  The premise is a rift of time dimensions opens a way for creatures of the past to enter the present time and wreak havoc in a modern city. A team of experts tries to capture the creatures and get them back to their time to avoid paradoxes occuring. But somethimes the frlightening creatures are killed. The back story is about the effect on paradox of time. So you've got a good scary monster movie series, with time travel and intrigue.",1439337600,2,749,4.548148148148148

5904011,4,B00ECXJC28,"When I heard about this new series, I had to buy it, having collected the original British Show.  Now I've seen both.  Yes, I have to agree with most of the other reviewers that this go round is a notch or two down the scale.  It starts out slowly, looking more like a rehash of the original and introducing the principle players of the story.  But it picks up steam as it goes along and develops new plot lines/conspiracies which depart  from the original British storyline.  I found that the characters grow on you in their own way and despite some other reviewer opinions, the principles' motivations are made pretty clear.  Two of the leads loose significant others to dinosaur  attacks at the get go and the two ""supporting"" leads are acting on loyalties forged to the lead hero (Evan Cross). He intervened in their lives earlier on, giving them a chance for a better life.
This takes place in British Columbia, Canada, which is made quite clear, and is supposed to represent a different approach to the anomalies problem as it crops up in the Western Hemisphere with barely any contact/expertise gotten from the British handling of the same phenomenon.  Yes, Conner Temple from the original shows up in the first and last episode here to ""stir the pot""  but is around more for context than for impact on events.  Basically, a private business owner gets sucked into forming a team to understand/battle this phenomenon under cover of his company and away from outside influences for the sake of security.  But, eventually the Government learns of the goings on and tries to take over from our hero's team.  We all know how a government run anomaly program would turn out, don't we?
The special effects are great.  The creatures are more limited in scope but provide some variety from the first series.  The issue of time travel paradoxes is flirted with here and adds some mystery as to why the action here was influenced so little by the British Series events/results.  This story ends with a doosey of a cliff hanger, which due to the show's cancellation, will never be resolved!  It leaves you hanging and wanting more.  That's a shame because I feel they were really hitting their stride.  None of the actors will be very familiar to American audiences, but they are good looking and do a tolerable job of acting.  We are not looking at Emmy Award winning categories with this show, but I could not help seeing it through and being left wanting more.  That's why 4 stars edged out 3 stars for me.",1389916800,,2505,4.660592255125285

5904017,3,B00ECXJC28,"I'd liked the British Primeval, especially the earlier episodes so when I heard this Canadian sequel existed, I wanted to see it too. I almost bought the British PAL DVD set but put it off and finally SyFy put it on. I watched every episode that I could, even checked SyFy's website out,  but was never quite as impressed with the characters or storylines. The dinosaurs I saw before our friends at SyFy started broadcasting at off hours- if at all- were better than some reviews let on.
Now I need to watch the DVD set to catch the episodes I missed on the viewer's marathon and to finally see the finale/ cliffhanger that I don't remember being broadcast (the trailer for it was on SyFy.com). It appears to me that the writers had a lot of loose ends (Connor Temple anyone?), too many for a good series to have.",1387843200,,813,4.42

5904021,3,B00ECXJC28,"Hi,

First let me begin by saying that I watched the British show for five seasons and really enjoye it. It was a little annoying as they kept killing off front line characters, and so you ended up in season five with only two original cast members who were both more minor roles, but you had to take the good with the bad. As you had to take the incredible scenes of empty city streets whenever a dinosaur went on the rampage.

PNW is not as good. It isn't terrible but it's limited.

The range of creatures battled is a long way down on what you saw in the British show. And that's important when in the original series half the fun was in working out just what the hell the team were facing in each episode. It lent the plot some twists. PNW leaves you really with just one plot - they're coming to eat you.

The characters are more mundane, less individual. Not many of them have deep dark pasts,and only one of them has some overwhelming need to be doing what he's doing. This steals from the drama of the show, leaving what could be a good character driven show a little flat.

There is a glaring plot problem in it in that the lead guy hunting down the anomalies is a private citizen with a personal reason for the hunt. And everybody else just falls in line with his quest for no really obvious reason. The plain fact of the matter is that if anomalies were showing up and there was proof, then the government would be everywhere. The British show covered this by having the Anomaly Research Centre as part of the government. This one just seemed to gloss over the whole problem, with only the black ops military people doing a sort of side research project and everyone else apparently just content to remain in the dark or allow a civilian to do the government's work.

Having said that this was a reasonable romp. Not up to the standard of the original but good enough to spend a weekend watching.",1385596800,17,1908,4.345505617977528
