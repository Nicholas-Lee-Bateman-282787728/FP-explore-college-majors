1719022,4,B000067J3O,"This movie consists of eleven snippets in the life's of eleven people with each snippet lasting from six to twelve minutes. Each snippet shows an interaction between two people, one of whom is in the next clip with another of the eleven people creating a string of connections between the eleven people. The two clips of each person also shows two completely different aspects of that person's life.

In all but two of the snippets the two people in the snippet have either a genetic connection (siblings or parent and child) or a romantic relationship (spouses or lovers), and in one of the two where neither exists it appears that a romantic relationship is beginning. One snippet has some flashbacks where some other people are involved in the story but other than that anyone else in the snippets are just people in the background of a public place with no direct involvement in the story. Most snippets are just the two main characters interacting with no one else present.

With the exception of the snippet with the flashbacks, the subject of each snippet is in some way the relationship between the two individuals in the snippet. These relationships include marital discord, adult siblings, a variety of parent child relationships (most with adult children but one with a minor child) and lovers (which includes heterosexual as well as male and female homosexual relationships). Overall the movie, as well as the individual snippets, are well done and interesting.

Three snippets include nudity. In one a woman is seen in full frontal nudity but in poor lighting. Technically a teenage boy is seen in full frontal nudity, but he is in the bathtub and the water movement totally distorts the view. Adult males are seen nude in all three of these snippets but only from the side or rear, but quite clearly in the side view and one of the rear scenes. There is also an oral sex scene between a fifty-year-old man and a man probably in his mid twenties (this is also the scene with the clear view of a nude male from the rear).",1414368000,9,2033,4.737288135593221

1719025,4,B000067J3O,"Or is that Woody Allen?
Ventura Pons weaves his Allenesque characters and their disfunctions through Altmas world of connected strangers, as frenetically as he weaves the camera through Barcelonas streets and highways.  From the warring couple, to the incestuous father and son, to the elderly women discovering lesbianism.
This film has many good things going for it; a sharp well written script delivered well by a talented group of actors; striking visuals and camera work that wouldn't look out of place in a Ridley Scott Picture.  It does however at times drift into the realms of melodrama but with the films scope that is to be expected.
Pons is up their with PT Anderson and Chris Nolan as young directors who wear their influences with pride.
Although not perfect it's pretty damn close and is a must buy for anyone with more than a passing interest in foreign cinema.",1039996800,2,877,4.879194630872483

I really liked the lead character because he was so feisty and the situations he got into were so weird, but he handled them all with perfection..",1441497600,,290,4.5576923076923075

7963497,1,B000067J3O,"In the blurb describing the film, I quote : ""- - eloquent topography of urban alienation and polymorphous.
sexuality.""  Could someone kindly decipher that ?  It seems to me the movies a lot of double-talk, making
no sense at all.  By the way, I love it when a reviewer, not understanding or following the meaning, in
their review states  "" it's OK"" or ""boring"" ! !",1486857600,,364,4.46969696969697

7963504,3,B000067J3O,Nothing special this anthology is a series of intimate (though not necessarily sexual) encounters which has a character from each installment carry over into a subsequent story line ending back up the first person to who we are introduced. The quality of the segments varies and there is little coherence between adjacent stories. Sadly there is no reason to like any of the featured characters so the further into the circle the viewer proceeds the more tedious it all becomes.,1465257600,2,478,4.9875
