8195717,4,B000QCU9V2,"I'd been hunting for ""Death Game"" for quite some time, so to finally own it for such an inexpensive price was a real treat.  A very creepy and disturbing film to say the least, this is a film that should be seen by all lovers of b-movie thrillers and bad 70s exploitation films.",1357603200,2,278,4.245283018867925
