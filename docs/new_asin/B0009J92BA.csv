8061835,5,B0009J92BA,The ONLY thing Rescue lacked was a laugh track. Put canned laughter on this and you would have a genuine hour and something long lost episode that was very funny. And Mary Ann was still hot.,1238544000,,190,4.305555555555555
8061836,2,B0009J92BA,"i picked this double feature from a $1.00bin at wal-mart because my family loves gilligan's island and dusty's trail. my wife and i if you have seen my other reviews show our two boys old shows we watched growing up rather than let them watch some of the junk that passes for family tv now.

  rescue from gilligan's island takes place 15 years after the show ended,and the problem is they waited to long to film it. what should have been a vist with old friends is just not as funny as the still try to do the slap stick comedy and the castaways are just to old to make it funny. it comes across as scary to see these older people falling and getting hit because you worry they may get hurt,so strike one.they take away some of gilligan's good natured sillyness and if you can believe it made him even dumber,strike two. and on top of all that the cast looks tired and just going through the motions(tina louise, who hated the show and felt it messed up her career didn't even show up so a woman named judith baldwin replaces her in the role of ginger)and the jokes are flat. even my young sons think this one isn't very good. a sad way to say goodbye to our friends.

the wackiest wagon train the west is the gilligan clone set in the west called dusty's trail(i have already reviewed that series in here), it's three episodes cut together to make a movie.stick with the almost complete first and only season dvd instead. for a dollar it's ok but anymore than that and your paying to much.",1143417600,,1491,4.333333333333333
