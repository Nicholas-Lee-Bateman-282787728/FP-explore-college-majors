2201284,5,B00076ONT6,"This DVD collection of Xena season 6 is an awesome series! Great fighting scenes! Great lessons to learn! Great visual effects and more! I love all the episodes in the series final year, season 6. Don't miss this DVD collection, a must buy.",1105401600,,240,4.604651162790698
2201285,5,B00076ONT6,"Season 6 was yet again another good Xena season. Loved all the travelling the trio did, good thing Eve went off to do her own thing eventually. Kudos to the producers for ending the show so controversially. Where's Beowulf?",1103846400,3,223,4.743589743589744
2201286,5,B00076ONT6,"I've been an unconditional Xena fan from day one & I'm convinced there will never be another show as noble, profound, rare and all encompassing as Xena: Warrior Princess was. With that, I own all 6 box sets & this season, hands down, is my FAVORITE for more reasons that I can express. The chemistry between Xena (Lucy Lawless) & Gabrielle (the brilliant Renee O'Connor) was always unsurpassed but they both just ILLUMINATED every adventure, every script, and every moment of this season like it was nothing. The acting was immeasurable and flawless, the plots were salted with idealism, stories of retribution and forgiveness, everlasting love, inexplicable sacrifice and unrelenting bravery, the profound depths of one's being exposed...EVERYTHING was touched upon this season. The special effects were top notch, the sets were lush and rich, the guest stars were excellent, the dialogue consisting of nothing but the best & their devotion to one another the strongest it ever was.

2201287,5,B00076ONT6,Very good show along with Hercules. It's been 15 months since Universal re-released season 5 (7/14). Don't know if they plan to re-release season 6???

This collection is better than the newer cheaper versions because of all the extras, if you like all the behind the scene action and interviews. If your willing to pay a little more for that then its worth every penny. The cheaper version of season six hasent been released yet, but will be like the previous five and just the episodes themselves which is fine also. But, I like the behind the scene items. Guess it's all in what you wanna pay for. Either way you go, can't go wrong with Xena.",1425686400,,544,4.396039603960396

2201305,4,B00076ONT6,A sad but wonderful last season of xena. The only thing I did not like about this sixth season was the beginning episode and the last final episode. I thought the first episode of heaven and hell was too much. I know this is about gods but I thought they should have left the heaven and hell scene alone. The last episode didn't make sense at all. It just did not seem like an episode of xena. I get they wanted xena to die but they should not have done it in that way. But overall the season was a really good season and I wish they would have went 8 or 9 seasons with Xena. I just did not like season 4 at all and think they really went too far with that one but overall all of the Xena seasons except season 4 was good.,1423094400,,722,3.9183673469387754

2201322,5,B00076ONT6,"Xena is my favorite TV show of all time. I watched it back in the 90's when it aired, but after seeing the final episode (FIN) my heart was broken. I had to put it behind me. Even though I told myself it was just a TV show, the horror of the last episode haunts me to this day.

Back then, I didn't know the Xenaverse existed! Recently, I decided I'd go back and watch X:WP again. I hadn't  realized how much I love this show, or how much my heart aches missing these two characters. There is no other show that comes close to the brilliance, the genius, the inspiration, or the chemistry that exists between the two lead characters (brilliantly acted by Lucy Lawless and Renee O'Connor).

X:WP is great for so many reasons, not the least of which it is so empowering for young girls and women. Even today, I read stories by adult women who relate that Xena changed their lives, is still changing their lives, whether it is because they are facing a major illness like cancer or supporting a friend through a difficult time like a divorce.

I wonder if anyone truly understands the ripple effect of Xena: WP! If you want a good idea, just check out all of the bards who found their voices and are published authors today. Many of them found their muse through Gabrielle on Xena. Honestly, I seriously doubt that anyone has truly understood the cultural phenomenon that Xena is. It was a major inspiration for the LGBT community who found an icon in these characters. I will always be grateful to Lucy, Renee, Rob Tapert, Liz Friedman and the rest of the Xena movers and shakers who embraced us, the fans, and encouraged us to love Xena in our own way. She will live on forever in our hearts.

What do you get when you buy the series? An amazing story that will tug at your heart strings and never let them go. Battle on fellow Xenites!!",1400976000,,1836,4.3882352941176475

You made a lot of fans so unhappy and disappointed and made Xena and Gabrielle so unhappy too as well.  Shame on you for ending the show this way.

2201352,5,B00076ONT6,"Xena:Warrior Princess is the best fantasy TV show EVER. I though Hercules with Kevin Sorbo would be but Xena was a LOT more tough, gritty, and VI-O-LLLLENT. One woman you do NOT want to get angry with you, EVER. Xena was the ultimate warrior in this series and often hinted at being related possibly to some deity biologically but which one was never revealed. She was an Amazon(that sounds like a familiar name), Valkyrie, and warlord rolled into one BAAAAAAAAD girl. Superhuman fighting skills and powers. A lot of characters from Hercules also appeared on Xena. The war with Dahak was literally Biblical and EPIC with Michael the Archangel and the Four Horsemen(not Ric Flair's version in past NWA wrestling days) helping to fight Dahak, a ""Satan"" like being bent on Earth's destruction. Action, action, action, action is Xena personified. If you like Beastmaster, Conan, Hercules, Legend(my all-time favorite with Beastmaster a tie), you will LOVE Xena. One other thing too although not quite as professional. The women on this series are GORGEOUS, especially Aphrodite. Why this woman is not seen more on TV is a low down, dirty, rotten shame. Easily the sexiest woman on TV in the last two decades. A good choice for the ""goddess of love"". Xena is a must-have for action/adventure/fantasy/martial arts fans of all ages. Highest recommendation possible!!!",1288915200,2,1360,5.075892857142857
2201353,5,B00076ONT6,"A number of years ago, I bought the first season of Xena.  Through a number of sources, the only way to get the rest of Xena was to consider buying the entire series as a box set.  Having the Season 1 Box Set at that point would then be pointless.  As I plan to also get Seasons 2 through 5, I decided to get Season 6 first and work backwards.  Many other retailers offering box sets of TV shows no longer carry older title box sets but Amazon.com retailers do.  When I am ready to get the seasons I am missing, I am going to Amazon.com to get them,  Xena was a fantastic series and it holds up to this day.  I was very happy that within days of ordering the box set, it arrived in my mail.  I want to be able to share the show with friends and now have a way of doing so.",1280620800,,772,3.872611464968153
2201354,5,B00076ONT6,Excellent action movie that you don't get bored of. Humour and romance are smoothly blended with interesting mysterious ancient legends and fast developing plot adaptations. The characters are addictive and they become your friends. The episodes are enticing and unforgettable. One of the best series ever.,1276214400,,306,5.673913043478261
2201355,5,B00076ONT6,"Xena can only be described as one of the most pivotal characters in television history - whether you loved or hated the show, she became a cultural phenomenon, the first true action hero that was a fully realized person with a sense of humor, flaws, and a sense of noble purpose.  The show built from a rather schlocky Hercules knock-off into a full-fledged original, and that's doing quite something.

As always in this series, shows are character-driven much more than plot-driven.  So while there's an over-arching story and mythology, if a story seems to illuminate or use a character to good effect, the story is presented.  Best episodes this season were ""Who's Gurkhan?"", the (creepy) cannibal story, ""The Abyss"", the excellent ""Rheingold"" arc (sort of a loose 3-parter), the very amusing and quite unexpectedly touching ""Old Ares Had a Farm,"" the amazing ""When Fates Collide,"" and the lovely, light ""Many Happy Returns.""  These episodes contain a lot of really wonderful moments between characters, and some in surprising ways.  ""Old Ares"" is a funny look at country life with the girls as they help a de-powered Ares hide from angry villagers - it is very entertaining.  And ""Many Happy Returns"" is the last fun moment of the series - Xena tries to get tickets to take Gabrielle to a Sappho concert for her birthday, and mayhem ensues, of course.  This episode contains the reading of a beautiful, authentic poem actually written by Sappho (or at least attributed to her), and while there's a bunch of silly stuff in the episode, the emotions are quite real here, a preview of what is about to happen in the finale.

""A Friend in Need.""  This one is very hard for me to even discuss.  Over the course of the six seasons the show ran, these characters sort of took on a life of their own for me.  I know they traveled all over the world, but having the series end in Jappa (Japan) was weird.  It was like the ending of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, in a way.  You know how it was about King Arthur and Camelot, and in the end, there are police cars and modern people all milling about with the knights.  Bizarre.  I would have much preferred to see this end in Greece, where it ostensibly began, so that it felt a little more like home.  I don't think I will be spoiling anything by saying that the death of Xena was painful to me; although I don't mind that she died, I would have liked to see Gabrielle go with her.  The need for her to remain dead rang a bit hollow to me, and I really didn't get that.  Still, the production values in this episode are gorgeous, and Xena is resplendent in her golden armor, although what it was shielding I'm not sure (the entire midriff and legs are bare - looks hot but not really very effective).

Overall, this season is just loaded with some great tv, and it is highly recommended.  The finale, while shocking and sad, at least does provide a fitting end to the Warrior Princess.  Xena and Gabrielle broke barriers in every episode, and for that alone, the show should be highly commended.  How clairvoyant were those writers to say ""...her courage will change the world."" ?  Because the truth is, it did - Xena paved the way for Buffy the Vampire Slayer, for Kill Bill, and for so many other great female lead roles.  At last, a strong woman who actually feels like a strong woman (and I include Gabrielle and the Amazons in this).  Too often, men writing women's roles seem to equate bitchy with strength, and it's just awful to listen to these shrill, emasculating bitches.  Once Xena came along, I think most writers collectively went, ""Ohhhhh... I get it now.""  So thank God for Xena!  Long may she live in syndication and on DVD!",1270425600,17,3688,4.562310030395137

And all is completely lost, in a panic from the staff that you can almost feel oozing from the screen as you watch this complete meltdown of ""HOW TO FINISH THE SERIES""!!!?? First, they take a show of SIX seasons, and take it to unfamiliar territory, with unfamiliar characters. Then, they SEPARATE all known characters. And in a quick flash, kill a character...but NOT with any sort of excitement or surprise that let's say, for example, Anya was killed in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. This was just plain POOR direction from a usually GOOD director, who will not admit to it... except to claim excuses of budget problems because of a musical canceled, blah blah.

It might appear that the producer was running out of steam up to this season and finally decided to put a close to the series. I was hoping that the end is where Xena and Gabriel were alive and they saw the result of their efforts to the humanity and finally decided to retreat to a seclusion, possibly or continue to lead a normal life thereafter.

2201362,4,B00076ONT6,"With the Olympian Gods out of the picture Xena turns her attention to the villains of the faith of Eli (i.e.: Jesus) and the angelic and demonic realms inhabiting the ever evolving heavenlies. Who could've guessed what a pivotal role the Warrior Princess was to play in the re-visioning of the new, reigning spiritual paradigm. How about starting out the sixth and last season of this highly entertaining though farfetched series with the ousting Mephistopheles from the throne of Hell?

This is only the first of many outrageous steps taken by the Warrior Princess. Not willing to ascend (on second thought descend is probably the more accurate word) to the vacated throne herself, she lures the proud Lucifer into assuming the position. Whether you're a hardcore Xena fan or just a casual viewer sooner or later you have to ask yourself the question ""is there no limit to what the Warrior Princess can accomplish in this world or any other for that matter? The answer is apparently not.

Yes, `Xena: Warrior Princess' is truly a television series for the ages. While her adventures and exploits may range from the absurd to the incomprehensible and the acting most of the time way over-the-top somehow believe it or not it was always tons of fun and the cast of characters where played to perfection by everyone involved.

2201365,5,B00076ONT6,"I've watched Xena since the very beginning.  Season 6 is probably my second favorite season (season 4 holds the top place).

The relationship between Gabrielle and Xena is as strong as ever.  Our ladies are TRUE warriors in every sense of the word.  From fighting various gods, monsters to just regular baddies, the Warrior Princess &
the Amazon Queen continue to fight for the Greater Good.

Lucy Lawless and Renee O'Connor were in top form during this season.  The beautiful story lines were back, and visually this season was great.

As far as the relationship goes, to all those who think TPTB (The Powers that Be)catered to the 'lesbian' crowd with season 6....

First, not everyone who is a subtexter/maintexter (someone who believes that Xena and Gabrielle are in love) is a lesbian.  Many of us are male, some are gay, some are straight.

Second, maybe it was TPTB that was catering to the 'shipper' crowd during season 5.

I feel TPTB finally got things back on the right track with season 6.",1198540800,,1001,4.728323699421965

2201369,5,B00076ONT6,"To read about people's dissatisfaction with the color, plus the blooper reel being a repeat from the season one DVD instead of one derived from the season six episodes, makes me wonder if I should avoid buying it unless they fix the problems. My main incentive for buying it: I'm surprised none of the reviewers have mentioned my favorite episode from the season, and perhaps the series, ""Path of Vengeance"", primarily for the incredible kickboxing battle between Gabrielle and Varia, which is Gabrielle's best choreographed and most exciting fight in the entire series (even though she gets knocked out).

The downside was having to endure the two-part series finale, A Friend In Need. If you haven't seen the last season and you're looking for a happy ending, DON'T watch the two-part finale, it will disappoint and possibly disgust you. It's a gory, pointless schlockfest which introduces Xena fans to a new character, complete with a time consuming backstory revolving around a character you can neither like nor justify the sacrifices made on her behalf. A sad ending to an otherwise wonderful series.",1149984000,16,655,4.8053097345132745

In the second to last episode, Gabrielle comments, ""What are we supposed to do, wander around Greece for the rest of our lives?""-or something to that effect.  I wished the impossible though.  The ending is believable but leaves unanswered questions.  The subtext in this last season seems to become the main storyline.  A must have for any true Xena fan.",1144108800,,427,4.702702702702703

However, killing Xena with an alluded finality in the end, when she had died and was resurrected several times over the course of the series, seemed nothing more than an attempt to get the fans' riled - which I believe they did.  The episode ""Old Ares Had a Farm"" is my favorite of this season.  Kevin Smith was a classic as Ares.",1142380800,3,406,4.246753246753247
2201373,5,B00076ONT6,"Xena has always been my favorite television series (among many others) when it was on. Though I had my disappointments with Season Five, the season finale ""Motherhood"" was a nice compensation for the let downs in that. Season six, however gave me more disappointments in what they tried to do with Xena and Gabrielle's obvious ""platonic"" relationship by riddling season six with ""crowd pleaser"" episodes for the large Lesbian cult following Xena had gathered since season two's ""Here She Comes Miss Amphipolis."" That aside, I thought season six was a pretty good way to end the long running series: The Story Arcs concerning more of Xena's past were completed with much explanation behind them.

The Comedic episodes were actually funny this time around, especially ""Many Happy Returns,"" -- that a was a side splitter majorly. The drama of Season six delivered in ways other TV series usually fail at with overbearing drama that you ultimately cannot stomach any more than a few minutes. Xena's drama was balanced out by the comedic episodes, the overall writing of each episode and the delivery of the actors in each scene. Many characters from previous seasons such as Alti, Joxer, The God of War, Ares (the late Kevin Tod Smith), and The Goddess of Love Aphrodite, all make their final appearances as the episodes near the finale. Gabrielle takes more an initiative, but not so much like she did in season five, behaving more like a warrior in the sense of the word while still retaining most the innocence and quirkiness Gabrielle had at the beginning series. Xena is a lot more kinder, as opposed to her character in the last five seasons. Although it can never be denied that the actor and actresses looked pretty bored playing their roles in the series (even Claire Standsfield - who hadn't been seen in Xena since ""Them Bone, Them Bones,"" looked bored in her role as the witch doctor type character. Xena and Gabrielle's chemistry in the more serious episodes seemed forced in a way to make you believe that they were at odds on a subject, especially in the Amazon oriented episodes. Kevin Smith managed to hide whatever scrap of boredom he had with his character and pulled of convincingly as always.

The DVD extras are plentiful, including bloopers which turned out not to be funny at all unless your merit a short lived giggled and frown afterward. I expected laugh my head off. The Cast interviews coulda been better executed in ways of editing and actor atmosphere: Lucy Lawless and Renee O'Connor looked completely beside themselves in boredom and uncomfortable silences broken my forced laughs in the cast interview for ""Many Happy Returns."" There are also season one promotional and a behind the scenes look at the ""A Friend In Need."" There are TEN DISC inside this box sets, which are also almost impossible to get out without the fear of snapping the DVD in two lingering in the back of your head. The final Disc contains the second part of the FIN and the director's cut of FIN (If I remember correctly), which is another positive point for this DVD BOX SET.

2201375,5,B00076ONT6,"Xena season 6 is one of the top seasons of all. Effects, colors, action, suspense,..... everything!!!! Very sad to see it go when it did, but it seemed to cover all ground and end appropriately. In other words it ran a beautiful course.

The manner of ending the series was without a doubt, the best avenue of the times they were portraying and it was great to see an illustrated (yet fictional) view of how things may have went on back then. To be honest, this season started my path in Spirituality and the Paranormal.

As far as other negative reviews in regard to Christianty,... I feel it is probably very close to what really happened. Christianity wasn't always the top religion and scenes dipicting that seem to be in line with that. As a very spiritual person I found it more interesting than insulting and just shows how this religion has endured over the centuries.

This series if definately for most people across the board and is perfect for individuals with different viewing tastes to come together via a show like this.

People into: Action/Martial Arts, Different Cultures,Mythology, Paranormal, Religion/Spirituality, Suspense and simply,..... beautiful people, can come together for a season/show like this.

This has been another Dragonfly Kingdom review. Enjoy!!",1121904000,6,1284,5.037735849056604
2201376,5,B00076ONT6,"Well, I must say, that as a borderline obsessive fan, I'm biased to say this is a great must have.  As usual, some episodes were flops, but most of them are absolutely great.  I've seen people say the color is off and all but I haven't noticed. I guess I don't pay much attention to that.  I was disappointed in the bloopers, and some of the commentaries, cause yes, it did seem that the actors just weren't into it, especially Lucy. But hey, I'd probably be bored the same way if someone forced me to watch something i did a few years ago and wanted me to comment on it.  This is actually one of my favorite seasons of Xena.  I must warn people who are only watching it for the first time, that this season really doesn't have lesbian 'subtext' like the previous 5 seasons.  Oh no, it's all maintext now. Xena and Gabrielle are obviously sexually attracted to each other in some eps., there are other obvious lesbians, and there is a definate kiss between Xena and Gab in the series finale (they only pretend it's a 5 minute long mouth to mouth 'water transfer').  So, if you have issues with this kinda stuff, prepare yourself. Other than that, it's worth every penny!",1121385600,4,1170,4.413953488372093
2201377,2,B00076ONT6,"Undoubtedly people will be upset with this review, but I want to warn (the very few) people who have never seen season six about some of the content.  While I would dearly love to get about half of season six on DVD, I morally feel like I can not spend my money to 'vote' for the things promoted in the other episodes.

In previous seasons, they kind of played the whole 'are Xena and Gabrielle lovers instead of just best friends?' thing, but it was generally subtle enough I could just roll my eyes at the supposed subtext.  In this season, we not only have Xena and Gabrielle blatantly sexually attracted to each other at times, but they had Aphrodite try to give Gabrielle a kiss.  The finale clearly had a kiss between Xena and Gabrielle.  It left me feeling like someone had hijacked my friends of old for a few cheap thrills.

(Just so you know, Xena's frequent sexual encounters with men she's not married to also bother me.)

However, the main reason I can't spend my money on this season set is because they treat Christianity like some mythos no one really believes, like it's totally okay to change and warp to fit whatever they want in the scene.  They were sensitive to 'The Way' controversy, but had no compunction against degrading and warping the message of a major religion repeatedly...and the sad part is very few Christians complained.  To have Xena trick a good (though proud) angel into becoming the devil, then to have a good angel portrayed in such a negative fashion...to have the Christian God just one of many gods and set on destroying all the other ones...to have a few of the old Gods (and the devil) as needed for a balanced universe (i.e. God isn't powerful enough and evil is necessary, not a perversion of good)...to have Christianity played as a cult only idiots would follow...  Well, it was insulting and offensive to me.  So I'm using my consumer's right to not spend money on it and my freedom of speech to tell other Christians that they might want to think twice about buying this set.",1120867200,25,2027,4.556473829201102
2201378,5,B00076ONT6,"In a collection like no other, the 6th season is simply astounding. One of the best action/adventure shows only gets better, but unfortunately to a close in the sixth installment.

2201379,5,B00076ONT6,"Season 6 has several great episodes and the DVD includes a lot more cast and crew interviews than any other, almost one for each episode, which I enjoy watching as a Xena fan.  The season 6 DVD of Xena has been claimed as the most exclusive yet and loaded with bonus features.  It includes interviews with the Interviews with the Actors, Producers, Editors, Writers, Set and Costume Designers including: Liz Friedman, Eric Gruendemann, Jane Holland, Michael Hurst, Lucy Lawless, William Gregory Lee, Joel Metzger, Renee O'Connor, RJ Stewart, Rob Tapert, Adrienne Wilkinson, and many more.  I love this feature simply because it was very informative and even funny, at times.  It is very interesting to see the actors talk about their roles and the storylines. Also, the various producers and directors comments give excellent and insightful background on what were the intentions behind an episode, the complexities and challenges involved in getting it done, and their perception on whether or not the attempted vision was successful or not.

This excellent DVD box set even includes never before seen footage of deleted and alternate scenes! These features are also the most enjoyable and most watched for any fans of a show.  They present several perspectives of how the story could have developed and they intrigue the viewers.  Similarly, the blooper reels are hilarious and so worth watching.  They show the ""human side"" of these ""supernatural"" actors/actresses and I love it so much.  Another feature that is worth mentioning is the photo gallery, which shows a beautiful retrospective of the characters of Xena.",1115596800,,1619,5.172413793103448
2201380,5,B00076ONT6,"Well. It had to come sooner or later. Season 6 of Xena offered all the best and the all worse the series producers had to offer.  They had some of the best episodes: Who's Gurkhan, Old Ares Had a Farm, To Helicon and Back; and some of the worst, Soul Possession and Send In the Clones.

The season 6 DVD offers extensive extras, such as commentaries and interviewss. But it also includes a behind the scenes look at the finale and some lost footage from the promos for the very first season.

If you're a fan of Xena or you're new to the fandom, this is definitely a buy.",1115164800,,571,4.220183486238532
2201381,5,B00076ONT6,"Lucy Lawless and Renee O'Conner are amazing to watch. In season six they had their characters down so well and they were so good at what they did. Gabrielle was really coming into her own; she was starting to take the lead a lot more (which would come in handy in the series finale). These episodes are some of the best. I really liked the Norse trilogy; I enjoyed watching evil Xena (she really was very evil!). Also there was the classic comedy ""Old Ares Had A Farm"". There are no duds in this season, in my opinion.

In addition to the wonderful episodes I am also really enjoying the commentary and interviews. Although I wouldn't mind having more extras, I am satisfied with what they gave us!

This is a great DVD box set for everyone to own!",1114992000,,748,4.374100719424461
2201382,5,B00076ONT6,"Xena Season Six was an extraordinary final farewell to our heroine Xena.  Epic battles, Exhilarating Drama, and life-long friend ships in our own hearts is the moral of the season. Seeing the DVD on sale on the official website, I knew it was a must buy for a fan like me, and anyone who enjoys action, betrayal, and remarkable storylines.

 In this season I would have to say that my favorite episodes were, ""Who's Gurkan?"", ""Old Ares had a Farms,"" and ""To Helicon and Back."" You see Gabrielle becoming a warrior, and finally actually being a legend, and actual warrior. The acting in the season six is outstandingly well. When I watch the characters ""Xena"" and ""Gabrielle"" I don't see the actors, but the characters.

 The DVD does not fall short of extras. Having Dolby Digital 5.1 very much improves the viewing. It has, along with the many commentaries, and interviews; it has photo gallery, bloopers, on set of the final episode, and the interesting ""Xena Convention 2004"", and MUCH more!

 Overall this season ranks 2nd in all of the seasons (6) of Xena. Five out of five stars! This is a must buy, and is an astonishingly beautiful yet heartbreaking end to our idol called ""Xena, Warrior Princess.",1114387200,,1205,4.7368421052631575

Season 6 is when Xena finally gets to do all those things that weren't allowed before. Grey areas get decidely greyer and the show definately goes from strength to strength. If all that fails to make you want to buy it, in Ares has a farm Kevin Smith spends a good deal of the time with his shirt off. :)

Do yourself a favour and buy this.",1114300800,,551,4.045871559633028
2201384,5,B00076ONT6,"I love season six of Xena; these episodes are so great! The drama is outstanding when it's meant to be, such as in `Coming Home', and `Who's Gurkan'. The comedy is also great! My favorite comedy episode of all times `Old Ares Had A Farm' is in this season; picture the handsome god of war, Ares (played by the late, great Kevin Smith), with no powers, on a farm with Xena and Gabrielle trying to get everything running smoothly while every warlord in the known world attempts to hunt down the former god. It's just a classic. This season is filled with great stories and wonderful action.

In addition to the wonderful episodes the box set also has some great interviews. Being a mega fan I would have loved to have seen more interviews, but I'm grateful to have what was given to us.

If your fan of Xena you shouldn't have to wonder about getting this or not.  All the epsiodes are good, besides ""You are there""  I think there running out of ideas for episodes.  I haven't had the time to explore the bonus materials, but will get to it.  This season is no different than Season's one through five.  If were lucky we will get a movie.  We need a movie desperatley.  Let's keep going at it, and it will happen.  Buy this DVD set to finish of the series.  It's no different.  Believe me.

Or maybe it's just me.

One disc 9, it says ""Bloopers."" Now, you've just bought season 6 on dvd. What season do you expect the bloopers to be from? Season 6? Beep! Wrong answer. The bloopers are from season one! Yes! I may be silly to like bloopers, but I was very disappointed. And I believe it must be a mistake. Some technician guy hit the wrong button. I've seen it before.

Tramp"" because some idiot hit the button for the season 2 episode  ""Warrior ... Princess ... Tramp"" instead, and no amount of arguing or explaining on the phone could remedy the situation? I stopped calling after the third identical video tape arrived in the mail. The problem eventually got fixed, but it took years. Seriously.

Also, the episodes themselves seem pretty screwed up with the color. The extras and interviews and featurettes are all fine--but the episodes! It looks like everyone took a bath in artificial bronzer, drank orange kool-aid and Renee ... oh Renee! What have the DVD gods done to your hair?!?

Can I get a resounding DISAPPOINTED?!?!?

Xena deserves better than this.",1110412800,8,1496,4.5390334572490705
2201391,5,B00076ONT6,"This season has several good episodes (When Fates Collide is one of my all time favorites) and the DVD includes a lot more Cast and Crew interviews than any other, almost one for each episode, which I enjoy watching as a die-hard Xena fan; it's like talking about your best friends with others who like them, too.

  The director's cut of the last episode is nicely done, plays like a movie.  However, the blooper reel is totally disappointing because there are only a few bloopers shown and all are from previous seasons; that the actors were so professional by the end that they made no mistakes, seems highly unlikely.

  Xena and Gabrielle have as many fun adventures as ever, I wish it didn't end.  I agree with the Kid (who reviewed the Director's Cut), I like to imagine that Xena and Gabrielle walked off into the sunset to new adventures and stories.",1110326400,,859,4.605263157894737
2201392,5,B00076ONT6,"The final season of Xena. The season where I think most fans dreaded each week. But not in the sense they didn't like it. Me, like most fans I think, dreaded each week because we knew that after the episode was over, it was one week closer to the final episode...the final battleground for the Warrior Princess.

I still can't watch the last episode again. Never before have I ever cried during a television show. But the powerful performances between both Lucy Lawless and Rene O'Connor were beyond words. The entire season went out with a bang. And the final episode, though I was a little disappointed in the ending, I do have to admit the final episode was worthy of this series.

Never again will there ever be another show like Xena. And never again will there ever be an actress of Lucy Lawless's talents on television.",1110326400,,826,4.574324324324325

8045010,5,B00076ONT6,"SPOILERS. I appreciate this series so much more now that I'm older. It really had a great feel to it, like a band that has fun onstage together. It was just obvious and came through on screen. The supporting characters were awesome, the campiness, the darkness (and it got DARK), the violence, the slapstick, and the romance, whether you were pro Ares or Gabrielle (knowing Xena, she probably had room in her heart for both) -- all served to create this amazing heroine. At the time Xena first aired, I think the only small screen heroine was Scully from the X-Files and maybe... Daria? But Xena was the answer to every inner tough girl wanting out and I haven't seen her like again. I don't think it would've been what it was without the infectious charisma of Lawless' portrayal. The finale, although sad, was fitting. She'd always expected to die with a sword in her hand and to have ended it in any other way would've been a disservice to the character. It only heightened the tragic story arc of someone who desperately sought redemption but was incapable of forgiving herself. Ah Xena, if you only knew.",1469750400,,1109,4.634517766497462
