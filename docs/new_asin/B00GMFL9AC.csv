8624577,3,B00GMFL9AC,It was decent for what it was. Nothing spectacular but don't regret buying it. Especially when it's a DVD that is not too easy to obtain. Good for a few jumps.,1458432000,,159,4.161290322580645
8624578,5,B00GMFL9AC,I have read the book based on the Skinwalker Ranch and this movie brings it to life. The movie follows the events at the ranch in a liberal manner. I was hoping for a more closely depiction of the actual events but this movie captures the frightening phenomenon that continues to this day. I would recommend watching this movie even if you are familiar with the unearthly encounters so familiar with the area.,1457481600,,409,4.616438356164384
