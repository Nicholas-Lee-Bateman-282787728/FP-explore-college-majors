2644476,4,B000HWZ4QG,"AIR BUDDIES is another take on the longstanding Air Bud franchise Disney DVD has pumped over over the last few years.  Air Bud was a dog (a Golden Retriever, no less) that could play baseball, soccer, football, volleyball, and basketball.  It only stands to reason that his offspring would be simply amazing as well.  This DVD tells their stories, and there are a lot of laughs along the way.

Patrick Cranshaw and Don Knotts were two of Hollywood's finest character actors, and they were good in this film.  They were joined by Richard Karn and Cynthia Stevenson, also veteran character actors and second bananas in top-rated shows like HOME IMPROVEMENT and DEAD LIKE ME.

The movie starts out with a bang, bringing the viewers into Air Bud's life as a dad with five incorrigable puppies that share his love of sports and his ability.  However, the puppies are too much for the family, as shown when they gang up on the nanny and tie her up.  At the same time, a villain sets his sights on their famous father, intending to bag Air Bud and sell him to a millionaire's spoiled son.  When the puppies run away from home to escape being separated and given away, they're used by the bad guys as bait.  Then, when their parents are dognapped, it's up to the puppies to save the day.

The humor is great, definitely jokes and physical comedy that keeps the younger viewers in stitches while providing an entertaining romp for the adults in the crowd.  This is one of those DVDs to buy for road trips in the family van because kids will want to watch this one over and over.",1167868800,12,1569,4.524822695035461
2644477,5,B000HWZ4QG,"Rosebud is my favorite, cannot figure out how they got those puppies to do

everything they did.  All AirBud movies are my favorites, but this one

with the ""talking"" is great.  It may always have the same story lines but

it is interesting to see how they get out of the ""fixes"" they are in.",1167782400,10,292,4.236363636363636
2644478,5,B000HWZ4QG,"Those puppies are awesome so cute! They all have their own little ways and really make this movie a must for anyone. Not just families, this will make anyone laugh.",1167091200,,164,4.5
2644479,5,B000HWZ4QG,"GREAT!!!  The children sat Q U I E T through the movie...however, the 4 yr old asked ""Why doesn't ""Sam"" (our dog) talk???",1166400000,,121,4.260869565217392
2644480,3,B000HWZ4QG,"If I could split my review, I would give it three stars from an adult's perspective but--based on the reactions of my sons (9 & 11 years old)--five from a kid's.  And I don't think it's just because we own a golden puppy.

Unlike the previous movies, the dogs talk in this one.  A couple of the puppies are really annoying when they talk (and will sound incredibly dated in about ... well, now), but the new conceit works pretty well for freshing up the series.

The best part of the movie, though, was the pleasant surprise of hearing Don Knotts' voice one more time.  He voices a (what else) deputy dog and it's like getting to listen to Barney all over again.  Half expected him to call someone ""Ange""!

Buy it for the kids, listen to it for the Knotts!",1165795200,27,756,4.319148936170213

2644777,3,B000HWZ4QG,"We don't have kids but have appreciated lots of kids' entertainment -- Hoodwinked, The Muppet Show, Harry Potter, Shrek, Blue's Clues, The Penguins of Madagascar. And we especially love dogs, but this was the first of the Air Bud series we had ever seen. It seems to not work on an adult level like those others I listed.

The acting was good in general, the talking puppies were very cute. If you are really into Golden Retrievers, maybe this will be enough for you. We found the storyline to be flawed, kind of silly and occasionally cliche'. Plus, one of the puppies is an African-American stereotype -- he wears a gold chain and likes rap, basketball, and questionable grammar. This maybe wouldn't be so distracting if they hadn't hired such an obviously white kid to voice his lines!",1381363200,,788,4.7101449275362315

2644803,5,B000HWZ4QG,"Air Buddies is a 2006 Disney direct-to-DVD feature film that was inspired by the Air Bud franchise. Directed by Robert Vince, this films tells the tale of Buddy(Tom Everett Scott, That Thing You Do), now retired, and his wife Molly(Molly Shannon, Saturday Night Live)became the proud parents of five cute and playful puppies called the Buddies. Each Buddy has their own unique personality, and their own style of getting into trouble. When a evil animal poacher plans to steal Buddy and Molly, it is up to the Buddies to save their Mom and Dad. Also starring Richard Karn(Home Improvement, Family Feud), Wallace Shawn(Toy Story 3, The Cosby Show), Debra Jo Rupp(That 70's Show) the late Michael Clarke Duncan(Daredevil, The Green Mile) and the late Don Knotts(Three's Company, The Don Knotts Show)in his very final performance, this spinoff of the Air Bud movies is a delight.

2644937,2,B000HWZ4QG,"My Grandson loves this movie but I had to stop letting him watch it because it models bad behavior, such as the villian ramming a stick onto a man's foot and shouting at him.  My little guy started doing the same behaviour. I do not understand why children's movies have to model such lousy behaviour and the story line was not very good.  I do NOT recommend this for toddlers.",1221609600,2,377,4.371428571428571

8141823,4,B000HWZ4QG,"Its  okay.  &  I  admit  it.  I  did  have  doubts  about  this  movie  before  watching  it.  Air bud  was  already  the  proud  father  before  these  guys  of  another  litter  from  movie  (Air bud world pup).  It  was  funny  watching  them  give  the  baby  sitter  a  hard  time.  Miss  Niggles  or  something  like  that.  So  someone  kidnaps  the  world  famous  air bud  &  Molly.  That's  true  golden  retrievers  are  worth  a  lot  of  money.  But  not  worth  near  as  much  as  going  treasure  hunting  on  the  Travel  channel.  What  were  those  3  goofs  thinking?  I  mean  give  me  a  break.  The  adventure  starts  off  as  the  Buddies  come  up  with  a  plan  to  rescue  their  parents.  &  start  out  with  Deputy  sniffer,  (Don Knots).  Rosebud  tries  getting  his  attention  but  he's  too  lazy.  They  go  to  the  movie  theaters.  Nice  of  them  to  drop  by,  eating  their  fill  of  snacks,  but  not  much  on  the  soft  drinks.  &  then  find  their  way  to  a  farm  where  they  meet  a  funny  looking  goat,  &  stop  their  pursuers.  Who  also  get  captured  &  caged  by  a  goat?  Weird!  Those  2  bumbling  idiots  were  supposed  to  capture  the  puppies  too.  But  fail,  &  wouldn't  call  them  the  luckiest  2,  getting  treated  like  losers.  I  would  have  loved  to  see  them  get  sprayed  by  the  skunk.  But  that's  not  in  the  script.  After  getting  skunked  Deputy  sniffer  is  on  the  trail  again.  Pew wee!!  I'm  glad  I  didn't.  &  tracks  his  way  to  where  Buddy  &  Molly  are,  who  manage  to  escape  on  their  own.  Then  they  return  when  the  Buddies  are  captured  shortly  after  their  arrival.  &  before  too  long  the  bad  guys  are  all  washed  up  with  grape  juice.  &  of  course  in  the  end  all  of  them  B Dawg,  Rosebud, Budderball  Buddha  &  Mudbud  all  find  homes.  They  were  just  determined  to be  with  the  ones  that  matched  their  personalities  which  is  understandable.  This  ones  worth  the  watch,  &  most  families  will  &  should  gain  a  lot  of  laughter.
Absolutely  hilarious!!",1522972800,,2140,4.351032448377581
