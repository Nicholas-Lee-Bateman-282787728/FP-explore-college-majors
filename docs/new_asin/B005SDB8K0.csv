Filmed live at The Heights Theater in Minnesota, this video can be enjoyed as a whole show or as individual clips without the crowd reaction. I prefer the live feel, but either way it's great stuff. Viewers of the first volume will welcome a return of Jack ""The World's Angriest RV Salesman"" Rebney in both his original thrilling masterwork, and in a new version where he goes just a little bit closer to completely insane getting so angry he runs out of curse words and starts replacing them with random wholesome words like ""fern"" and ""dock"". I have never seen anything like it.

Joe Pickett and Nick Prueher, the founders of The Found Footage Festival, host this event and provide background and limited commentary about these videos. You will be glad they sat through thousands of hours of instructional videos, cable access television, and otherworldly found footage to edit these gems into palatable morsels of cinema gone awry. A highlight of this DVD is the New York cable access show ""Stairway to Stardom"", which features a genial and avuncular host and a lot of amateur ""talent"". At one point this is described as ""'The Gong Show' without the gonging"", and that is an entirely accurate description. Watch especially for the song ""Hairdresser"" and the most painful rendition of ""You Light Up My Life"" ever heard.

The festival takes a quick detour into hip hop with ""Rap Montage"" that includes rapping about, among other things, acne and fire safety, and even contains rapping pirate ventriloquist dummies. Really. If rapping isn't your thing, settle in for ""Queens Home Movie"" which was found at a Queens, New York estate sale and is both jarring and revealing. I guarantee you've never seen a dance like this, though.

""Celebrities Who Teach"" features videos and public service appearances from stars in misguided roles. Watch for the Fonz discussing safety skills, Mr. T discussing recuperation methods, and a special song about the anus. (I didn't make that up.) Following that up would be difficult, but Nick and Joe offer up ""The Boring Montage"" which is funny while living completely up to its name.

After that there is a promotional video from the Bright Coop company, and it's one of the most terrifying things I have ever seen. It's called ""The E-Z Catch Chicken Harvester"" and it provides an automated method of getting your chickens from their coop to another area. Bear in mind this machine does not kill them or even harm them, but it takes them on one scary ride. ""It's like a roller coaster for chickens!"" This video really is a horror movie for poultry.

Switching gears from fowl carnival rides, we get to ""Public Cable Access Dance Montage"", which is stunning. Watch for the Dirty Dancing instructional put out by Patrick Swayzes mom! Also please note my favorite dance move, ""The Afro Tilt"".

All of this leads up to my very favorite segment of the video in which Harvey Sid Fisher sings astrology songs complete with interpretive dance. In fairness I had heard of Fisher years ago when his ""Aires (I Am The Ram)"" song was on a compilation CD of astonishingly strange music I bought, but I had never heard the other 11 songs of the zodiac. You will not be disappointed. Nick and Joe even got Harvey to come onstage with them at a show in LA while Joe did an interpretive dance as Leo. The photos of this are worth the price of the DVD alone. Bonus points to the hosts for the picture of Harvey's Volvo! (Watch it and see.)

""How to Seduce Women Through Hypnosis"" is both patently ridiculous and disturbing, but it does give Nick an excellent opportunity to model a relevant beauty product, segueing nicely to ""Health and Beauty Roundup"", which contains a bevy of unusual instructional videos for things like the Flowbee and a special gem titled ""An Introduction to Saline Nasal Cleansing"".

""This Week in Public Access"" starts out with the crowd-pleaser ""Unarius"" going on about the space brothers, a gentleman you might not want to take medical advice from touting his book ""Lyme Disease: The Untold Story"", a wonderful music video inspiring a great Captain Beefheart joke, and a Chicago kids dance show called ""Chic-A-Go-Go!"", which is utter chaos. As a special bonus, Nick and Joe visit a taping of ""Chic-A-Go-Go!"" and pandemonium ensues.

Every Found Footage Festival has an ""Exercise Montage"" and this one is more disturbing than most. My favorite is ""The Caveman Workout"" which apparently involves hitting yourself repeatedly, but there's also a great Russian workout, and if you want your workout a bit mellower, try the Pat Boone Workout. (No kidding.) What I recommend you not try under any circumstances is ""Disrobics"".

This is a great DVD. It's a wonderful concept presented perfectly. Some of the videos will completely astonish you, but I guarantee you've never seen anything like it! Highly recommended!",1451174400,,4952,4.870546318289787
8484781,5,B005SDB8K0,"Hilarious!  More Winnebago Man!  Watch out for the flailing penises though.  Naw, I'm just kidding.  There are no flailing penises in this video.",1384473600,,145,5.173913043478261
8484782,5,B005SDB8K0,a great DVD of funny VHS tapes. i love these DVDs they bring my back in time. they are great to have to entertain friends and family. everyone i show these DVDs too loves them.,1334880000,,176,4.057142857142857
8484783,4,B005SDB8K0,"What the first reviewer was saying was correct - these would have been more entertaining without the commentary from the hosts - most of what they're saying detracts from the hilarity of the videos however they did manage to get a couple funny comments in there.

I was laughing so hard at some of this stuff, tears were in my eyes. If it was simply just all the videos without the hosts in between, I'd give this a five. Some of this stuff is hard to believe - an actual ""how to"" video on how to hypnotize women to have sex with you. Gary Coleman in an industry video typing so fake it's laugh out loud funny. The cable access stuff is priceless - I could watch the ""Star Search"" type show from New York for hours. One girl is doing very simple dance moves and the host walks up and seriously says ""I understand you're self taught"" (I lost it there). One little kid sings a song from Sound of Music, then after jams his finger up his nose, the host says ""hey, don't pick your nose on TV!""

I am going to watch the other videos. A must see if you want to laugh.",1332892800,,1061,4.145631067961165
8484784,4,B005SDB8K0,"These guys watch and collect tens of thousands of hours of old VHS tapes to bring you the funniest and most bizarre collection of home movies, instructional programs, public access, infomercials, video dating, broadcast TV and outtakes from the 80's and early 90's. They boil it down to an hour and 1/2 of hilarious 1 to 5min clips minute clips of the best stuff. It's really funny, basically the funniest Youtube clips, before there was Youtube. As much as I love and appreciate effort and accomplishment of collecting, watching and selecting these clips the only draw back for me is the added commentary and the fact that the show is presented to a live audience for the Dvd's I would prefer just watching the clips without commentary, skits and audience reaction, but it's brilliant and hilarious all the same, highly recommended.",1332633600,,833,4.914893617021277
