8214381,5,B000UR9TAU,Each episode stands alone so you are not left with any clifhangers.  The quite and tranquill tones of the episodes are relaxing as well.,1389052800,,136,4.666666666666667
8214382,5,B000UR9TAU,"Mushi are living organisms in their purest form. Ginko is a Mushishi, a man that studies the Mushi. Not everyone can see Mushi. Those that can are either scared of them or fascinated by them. Ginko travels the country helping people who have encounters with the different varieties of Mushi.

Each episode of this series is a different story. Ginko's travels lead him to many people that need his help. I am blown away by this anime. The animation, music, and plot are all superbly done. I can't say enough good things about Mushishi. I hope you check it out. It's great that Funimation put this title in the SAVE edition. I think that's the cheapest way to buy the complete series, so I would go that route instead. It's a steal for the money.",1354752000,,744,4.511111111111111
8214383,5,B000UR9TAU,"Don't for a second think that this'll only float your boat if you enjoy other anime. It borrows none of the story telling devices or cliches, instead it's a series of vignettes that explore the physics of this world. And what a lush and beautiful world it is! So quiet and eternal, this show is calming in a way that reminds you that nature brings life and death, and that that's ok. This show doesn't compromise it's characters for wow factor, the ending of a show always makes sense. Might seem slow, but keep with it. Beautiful, worth a watch from anyone who appreciated the art of storytelling.",1285891200,,598,4.546296296296297
8214384,5,B000UR9TAU,"Mushishi is an absolute masterpeice. It's a fantasy/drama unlike any you'll ever find, and it's my favorite anime.

Each episode tells a different story. I thought I would be bothered by this, but I wasn't. This adaptation is very faithful to the source material.

Mushishi evokes many different emotions while viewing it. Some episodes may have a really nice ending, while others can be really sad. The beautiful background music amplifies these effects.

The music is very serene. Listening to the OST, something I do everyday, is the best way to relieve stress. It really works wonders for the anime, especially when considering the quality of animation maintained throughout all 26 episodes.

I have yet to see an anime series animated as beautifully as Mushishi is. Everything was so well done, you can tell they spent a lot of time translating this from the manga. The Mushi are reminiscent of the creatures you would find in a Hayao Miyazaki film, the Kodoma of Princess Mononoke perhaps. They have a certain magical aura, a mystifying presence, that makes you want to see more and more of them.

I suggest you buy the DVDs, which come in a very nice package with lots of extras. This is an anime which should be seen by anyone who enjoys anime.

This DVD contains episodes 11-14",1203292800,2,1286,4.796380090497737
8214385,5,B000UR9TAU,"Mushishi continues its episodic format, but sterrs clear of the ""Monster of the Week"" formula by concentrating on character interaction rather than finding the magic bullet. This volume is every bit as gorgeous as the previous two, a testament to the superiority of the cel painted characters and backgrounds, and the special attention in making what little CG there is fit the overall look of each scene.

Mushishi is all about setting the mood for each episode, and helping the viewer see the effects of the mushi through the character's eyes.

This series doesn't suck you in, rather, it invites you along to observe  Ginko's travels.

A must view even for those new to anime, and a must have for the collector.",1196899200,2,714,4.827868852459017
