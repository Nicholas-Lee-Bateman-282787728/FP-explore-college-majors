4602127,5,B0058YPH5G,"When I saw previews for this show I got upset. I assumed it would be filled with drama or become totally unrealistic. Listen, I watch Disney stuff and realized a lot of the work looks cheesy. But watching this show, the first time, became a new ritual. It's about family, loyalty, relationships, and insecurities. It took me back to when I was learning ASL (still having problems with that). I have to say, Constance Marie has blown my mind in this show. She's such a passionate actress. She plays the mother to Daphne, who happens to be deaf, a alcoholic, single mom, trying to make ends meet. The entire cast has something to bring to the table. Bay and Daphne (deaf) were switched at birth...the hospital fault. Daphne is willing and open to experience a new life with this new family while Bay is just this spoil brat who feels opposite from the world. Her brother (played by Lucaas Grabeel) has a gambling problem. His mother (Lea Thompson) cares a lot about her social status and dad is just being dad. I love this show for so many reasons. This is one show I wouldn't mind watching over and over. Its giving me more confidence, rather comfort in ASL than I've had before. As well as embracing the difference between my and the deaf culture. Honestly, I got excited when Daphne explain to the family that Deaf people rather be known as Deaf...I learned that in college",1313971200,,1374,4.566801619433198
4602128,5,B0058YPH5G,"This is my favorite tv show! It is soo good! It's not hard to follow even though a lot of it is done in ASL. Which is one of the reason's that I love it soo much. The lead actress, Katie Leclerc, is not deaf for real but she does have Meniere's Disease. So she is hard of hearing, and sometimes fully deaf. It's a disease that affects the inner ear. making some people deaf or just causes them serious pain. I know a lot about this disease because my father has it. He is 75% deaf. So it's hard to have a normal talk with him. He can't hear. He just recently got Meniere's. So I have a lot of respect for Katie. it has to be hard to work such long hours with the bad head aches and just terrible pain that this disease can cause. I didn't know a lot about ASL before watching this show. It has opened up a lot of things for me. I am now studying books and trying to learn whatever I can about ASL. It's just such a beautiful and amazing language I'm actually sad that I didn't know about it before now. I am trying to learn it so I can help teach my dad before he goes 100% deaf. Plus I could end up getting Meniere's. So I want to be prepared. I hope that other people will give this show a chance. It isn't like other shows, it's better.",1312848000,10,1239,3.9402390438247012
4602129,5,B0058YPH5G,"I saw a preview for this show before it premiered and I thought ""Hmmm, could be interesting) So I tuned in for the premiere and I've been hooked ever since! I got my mom & all my close friends hooked on it as well!

I love the entire cast, they're all so unique, but fit together so well! The concept and writing is phenomenal! This show is better than ""The Young and the Restless"" (and I've been watching that since birth practically, lol.)

I have good news to report from ABCFamily! The show is continuing ! They're are going to extend the first season into a full 32 episode season,it continues in early 2012!

I wish it wasn't such a long wait, but I'm so glad it'll be back! So thank you ABCFam. for such a fantastic show and thank you to everyone that watches!

I will definitely be buying this when it is released and I recommend it to everyone!",1312761600,,853,4.279503105590062
4602130,5,B0058YPH5G,"I originally saw the previews for this show and thought, switched at birth? this looks really cheesy and i assumed abc family would make it a syrupy sweet show. However, i randomly started to watch it and it is an awesome show. I am studying ASL (American Sign language) because i would like to be an ASL Interpreter. and this show sheds light on the deaf community, which i think is wonderful. This show gets 5 stars from me, i am definitely buying this dvd set when it comes out. I only wish the season was longer, and that it will hopefully last for many many seasons to come. So do us Switched at Birth viewers a favor and watch this show. Give it a chance maybe it'll surprise you like it surprised me.",1312588800,4,707,4.2835820895522385
4602131,5,B0058YPH5G,"My wife and I are both deaf. We personally thought, ""Switched at Birth"", was an excellent show! My wife and I agreed that some of parts reminded us of our experiences we went through with our hearing families. I felt this show would be a great example to help the hearing people understand better about deaf culture. Unfortunately, it'd shown on cable channel only instead of regular ABC channel. I am considering buying this DVDs for some of our families who need to learn about us. I hope it will give them a wake up call.",1312329600,113,524,4.46875
4602132,5,B0058YPH5G,"my mother nagged and nagged and nagged at me to watch switched at birth.  i am not a tv watcher.  im a book person, i movie person but tv, i just don't get around to it.  One weekend im sitting on her couch and she asks, since im not doing anything would i like to watch switched at birth (which she still had on the dvr).  Within the first couple of minuets i was glued in and by the end of the first episode i was at the point where i could watch it for hours and hours and hours.  it was just that great.  real people, real situations, great characters.  its not just about 2 girls being switched at birth but thats just a part of the story.  its about a wealthy mother (played by the wonderful leah thompson who you may remember from ""some kind of wonderful"" from the 80s) who never met her birth child having to learn to step up to the plate with her long lost deaf child ""daphne"" and get to know her.  its about ""bay"" whos trying to find someone who she can connect with in her own family until she discovers (hahaha puerto rican kids just don't usually come from red headed white families, sorry, hadda throw that in), its about a mother ""regina"" (she also played the mom in george lopez) a hair dresser from the other side of the tracks, who is just trying to get by the best way she can and being a great mother.  its about a teenage brother getting to know a sister he never knew and battleing his own demons.  and a father who is just awesome.  last but not least theres me and my moms pretty much mutual fav, the adorable red head whos had daphnes back through it all, her best friend ""emmette"".  he really does light up the screen.  you want somethin to happen good for this guy so much.
the show is having a short summer season.  i want it back.  i want it be a regular show with like 18-22 episodes.  people you gotta tune in.  it needs viewers to survive and ive yet to meet anyone outside my family thats seen it.  abc family, monday night!  im definatly buying this dvd.",1311206400,50,1988,4.154450261780105

4602238,3,B0058YPH5G,"I know that I bought this over a year ago, but I was watching a YouTube video related to the deaf culture and it made me want to rewatch the show Switched at Birth, and I looked it up on Amazon and read some reviews. And I was wondering if I had the whole season or just the first 10 episodes. As it turns out, I had found out that I got only the first 10 episodes, so, volume one does not really mean that you have the whole season. I am mad at myself for buying this, but I am not mad at the people who have been apart of the show for so long, the show is very wonderful and I wish that there were more people that could see how deaf people can be just like everyone else. And I am only mad because I should have figured out that I had only gotten only 10 episodes out of 30.",1470441600,7,777,3.773006134969325

4602595,1,B0058YPH5G,"the first season got me hooked.  I really appreciated what I learned about deafness.  Unfortunately as it progressed it turned into an orgy.  I could not believe an ABC 'family' show would promote teenage sexual activity - or should I say promiscuity.  Then enter the 'gay' agenda.  Ironically the one person on the show that appears to hold fast to some morals and dignity is the 'white male very conservative republican' senator.  I am so disappointed in this series - it had so much potential and turned into an R rated promotion of teen sex, drugs, violence, destruction of property, homosexuality, lying, cheating, you name it - it's all there.  And this is all wrapped in a 'family friendly' package.  Not for my family.

4602901,4,B0058YPH5G,"What do I enjoy about Switched at Birth: it's well-written(except for one character), well-executed, an intriguing hook, across the board good to great acting, and it moves along at a good pace. The secrets don't stay secret forever, and characters take action instead of letting things fester.
What do I not enjoy: Bay. The actress does a good job of conveying believability and dedication to the character. My problem stems from how she's written. Early on in the series, Bay displays a great deal of selfish, obnoxious behavior that didn't endear her to me as a viewer. Yes, Bay is 16 and trying to understand why she feels different or something is off. Totally understand, having been a 16 year old girl myself. However, Bay is so constantly about me, me, me, I, I, I, that she comes off more like a person who needs to have a reality check happen. Her decisions and questions become the impetus for the story, but she has no consideration for what she's doing/done to other people. Instead of trying to understand how she feels, I'm often left wanting Bay to be dragged to a therapist's office, preferably with the rest of her family to try and straighten things out.",1374883200,,1173,4.699029126213592

The worst thing is that I had to remove the plastic to find out it's not the complete first season so now I can't return it!  I guess Volume One is NOT Season one.  I was really looking forward to sharing this with my family and friends...now I can't because I don't have the entire season. Bummer.,1360108800,28,419,4.148148148148148

Of course it has the teen/family drama story line, but it also displays a lot of deaf culture and community! That was important to me and I love it. It really allowed me to see the world differently than a hearing person. Not only did I love this season but am currently hooked on season two. This show could be a great time killer for a new or old ASL student wishing to experiencing a little culture. However I am not sure how accurate it all is, it is after all a T.V show, but either way, I fell in love with the story  :)",1359417600,,619,4.073770491803279

Yes, the premise of two babies being switched at birth is far fetched, but the characters play it very genuinely, and yes, they make it believable.

I especially LOVE the scenes when the deaf characters communicate with each other. They force you to pay attention, and the expressiveness of the actors is captivating.",1354665600,,482,4.670588235294118

I was very impressed. The acting is superb. Bay does a nice job playing the rebellious heart-broken teenager who just found out her life, her mom, and dad, are not her real parents, and that her life as she knows it is not the true biz life she thought. I love Daphne's description at the end when her boyfriend asked who is that girl, meaning ""Bay"". Daphne, who thoughout the movie, portrays a very happy teenager who accepts life at it comes, thought about it for a moment--Bay is not her sister, but how does she explain who Bay is? She finally stated, ""she? that girl? She is me from a previous life. We switched."" It was beautiful. I highly recommend this show to hearing and Deaf--I have to applaud ABC for putting out a family friendly show that is heart-wrenching at times, funny at times, and over all an excellent depiction of true life struggles.",1350604800,,1076,4.609375

I'm between the ages of the parent characters and the grandmother on the show, so this is not just a show for teens or 'tweens, though I think would be great for either.  The material about deaf culture gives the program wonderful richness and the acting and dialogue are really good--better than you'd expect for a show on ABC Family.  The main characters/actors are very appealing and the show draws one in quickly.  It's reminiscent of another of my favorites, ""The Gilmore Girls,"" without the kitch-y comic bits.  Season 1 was created in two segments, so this fall of 2012, episodes airing are still considered part of season 1.",1348790400,,700,4.8

4603275,5,B0058YPH5G,"I have thought for a long time that sign language ought to be mandatory in elementary school and used throughout life.  There are so many cases where hearing people can use this (scuba divers for one) and I think it would help the deaf community beyond measure.  Too many times, a second language is thought of as a novelty, when speaking another language can really enhance the human brain and help so many others (even from hearing to hearing) people to communicate better.

I started watching this show right from the beginning and it hooked me right away.  The plots twists and the real people situations are done with a great deal of intelligence.  There is great depth in a lot of the dialogue - I absolutely LOVE the signing dialog as well.  Both my wife and I watch this together and I got my sister and mother hooked on it as well.  If only my own kids (all grown up) would pick it up.

There is so much garbage on TV, it feels so good to have such a wholesome and well thought out show that doesn't insult us but informs and teaches in such a remarkable way.",1347926400,,1068,4.331658291457287

4603278,5,B0058YPH5G,Another ABC Family Hit.  Quite different from the other series on television now.  I especially like that sign language is a part of the series on a regular basis. True to life.,1346976000,,177,4.5
4603279,4,B0058YPH5G,"My wife and I started watching this show and were immediately impressed. The acting is strong, especially the teenage characters, who convey a maturity far beyond their years. The production quality is very good. The soundtrack is usually a subtle piano but really adds a lot.

The show is obviously about two families whose kids were switched at birth. However, one of the daughters is deaf and so the show is as much about coping with deafness as it is about the switch at birth. Generally, the show handles deafness tactfully. It's not just the ""poor little deaf girl"". The deaf characters aren't saints and actually have their own foibles.

The show does suffer a bit in its plots. The writers seemed to want to give each episode crazy twists, a la Desperate Housewives, but it just doesn't work as well in this show. This isn't a comedy, it's a drama. There aren't that many funny moments. As such, the crazy, out of left field plot twists come off as poorly conceived rather than clever. If anything, it makes the characters themselves look stupid because they always end up making such horrible choices. The show has enough weight just with the acting and emotional drama. I think less ridiculous plots would add, not subtract, from the rest of the show.

Overall, this show is one of the more wholesome things on TV these days.",1344902400,,1335,4.696581196581197

I decided to watch the pilot on a whim, and was hooked from the first ten minutes. All of the characters are relatable, genuine and easily loveable. I finished the entire series in two weeks, and can barely contain myself to wait for the next season in the fall.

'Switched at Birth' is also a great family show, and if you have teenage children at home, watch this with them. Not only does it tackle coming-of-age issues and current events, but it also introduces them to the deaf culture. Before you know it, you will be hooked.",1338854400,,684,4.652892561983471

I needed something to watch and was out of movies and was also caught up on the other TV shows I watched so I went to the ABC Family web site to hunt for something I hadn't seen before.
I clicked on the site and found The Secret Circle the week before and loved it so I thought if they did Secret Life Of The American Teenager and The Secret Circle so well there MUST be another good series to watch.
Well, there sure was.

Switched At Birth is a fantastic series and well acted by several veteran actors along with some new teen faces in the crowd.  It can be a very heavy drama at times, but it's so wonderfully executed that you feel, laugh and cry right along with these people.

Thanks ABC Family for yet another fabulous show.  You keep giving us hit after hit.  Well done!",1337904000,,896,4.2976190476190474

4603354,4,B0058YPH5G,"""Switched at Birth"" is a unique teen drama series that manages to capture the life of the American teenager but also inclusion of storylines that center around those who are deaf.

The opening premiere gave the ABC Family network its highest-rated premiere with 22-episodes being planned for release in 2012, ABC Family is now releasing the first ten episodes on DVD via ""Switched at Birth: Volume One"".

""Switched at Birth"" is a series that focuses on two families, one family is the wealthy Kennish family featuring former Kansas City Royals baseball player John Kennish (played by D.W. Moffett, ""Thirteen"", ""Traffic"", ""Falling Down""), his wife Kathryn Kennish (played by Leah Tompson, ""Back to the Future"" films, ""Caroline in the City""), their daughter Bay Kennish (played by Vanessa Marano, ""The Clique"", ""The Brooke Ellison Story"") and son Toby Kennish (played by Lucas Grabeel, ""High School Musical"" films, ""Milk"").

The other family is the Vasquez family which consists of single mother Regina Vasquez (played by Constance Marie, ""George Lopez"", ""Selena"") and her daughter Daphne (played by Katie Leclerc, ""Veronica Mars"", ""Flying By"") and Selena's mother Adriana (played by Ivonne Coll, ""Lean on Me"", ""The Godfather: Part II"").

The series begins with Bay Kennish wanting to know why she looks so different from her parents. It has always bothered her but when she asks her parents for a favor to do DNA testing, her parents do just that and they find out that Bay is not their true blood daughter and that the hospital made a mistake and their baby was switched at birth with the Vasquez family.

So, immediately both families meet and despite Bay initiating the tests, she is not too thrilled that she is not the real blood daughter and to see Daphne, a redhead young woman being raised by a Puerto Rican mother.  She is also deaf.

Immediately, after discovering who their true blood daughter is and that their children were switched at birth, knowing that the Vasquez are not in the best financial state, offers to let the Vasquez family to live in the guest room.  Also, it can help the Kennish family get to learn more about their daughter.

But immediately, the Kennish family wants Daphne to go to the best school, consider having surgery to give her a chance to hear and a lot of parenting things that go against how Regina has raised her daughter and sure enough, this leads to various rifts between both Regina and Kathryn on how Daphne is to be raised.

Meanwhile, Daphne  starts to learn that she gets her fiery temper but also her interest in art through her real blood mother Regina.  And as quick as she found her real mother, Bay now wants to find who her real father is.

But because Bay tends to do things without thinking about if first, she and Daphne tend to clash. Especially when it comes to guys as Daphne starts to take a liking to Bay's ex-boyfriend Liam and Bay takes an interest in Daphne's childhood friend Ty.

Meanwhile, as the Kennish family are pursuing a lawsuit against the hospital and wanting nothing more but a public apology, they receive distressing news that their lawsuit may not go far, because of something that Regina has done in the past.

VIDEO, AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Switched at Birth: Volume One"" is presented in widescreen (1:78:1) and for the most part, the picture quality is satisfactory for this drama series. Also, it helps that the series features various settings, including many outdoor shots which definitely makes the PQ for the DVD much better.

Audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The series is front and center channel driven, dialogue is clear and understandable and music comes out quite clear from the front channels. The series is not the type of series that utilizes special effects or the use of the surround channels but if you have a modern home theater receiver and a 5.1 or 7.2 setup, definitely worth selecting audio on all channels on the receiver for a more immersive soundscape.

Subtitles are in English SDH.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Switched at Birth: Volume One"" surprisingly comes with no special features at all.

EXTRAS:

""Switched at Birth: Volume One"" comes with a slip cover case plus ""Switched at Birth"" iPod stickers.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I am definitely enjoying ABC Family's ""Switched at Birth"".  I love the characters but I also love the complexity of how things are between family and friends.

For example, to compare with another ABC Family show ""The Secret Life of an American Teenager"", I dislike how everyone from different circles manages to be stuck within their circle (including main characters dating each other within that circle) and everyone gets a long so perfectly.  As much as I have enjoyed the show, those situations tend to be a major pet peeve of mine when it comes to that series.

With ""Switched at Birth"", the writers are not afraid to bring in newer characters, even for love interests but then not afraid to move on without certain characters.  Also, nothing is hunky dory with these characters.  There is always drama and just when you think these families are going to click with each other, something will drive them apart.

If anything, life is not perfect and writers are not quick to submit to happy endings for these characters.

Also, it's interesting how they take on the characters that are deaf.  The series looks convincingly real and I thought that actress Katie Leclerk (who plays Daphne) was actually deaf, until she had a dream she was a normal girl and was talking perfectly.  So, for her to play a deaf girl and having that similar speech pattern, I was quite impressed.  She does a fantastic job playing the role.  As well as actor Sean Berdy who play the role of Emmett.  He may be able to hear, but he can't talk and if anything, his face really tells you what kind of emotion he is feeling.

But so far, casting has been spot-on with this series.  Both young and older talents of the series do a wonderful and believable job so far in these ten episodes.

While, there are some major developments that take place towards the final three episodes, it'll be interesting to see how the series will go, once the series comes back to television in Jan. 2012.  Things have not always been the best between the Kennish and Vasquez families, especially between Bay and Daphne....but obviously, how things ended in episode 10, you have a feeling that something bad is going to happen between these two characters?

But with ten-episodes, I watched each of these episodes in a quick marathon and was pretty captivated to the storyline from beginning to end.  I just wished there was more added to the DVD.  May it be interviews or even special features or gag reel, that would have been great to see.

Overall, ""Switched at Birth""  is an enjoyable drama series on ABC Family and I'm hooked!  If you are looking for a very good family drama on television, don't hesitate in giving ""Switched at Birth"" a try!

Definitely recommended!",1335571200,,8756,4.733817701453105
4603355,5,B0058YPH5G,"This show is awesome! It made me want to start learing ASL, which I did and find this language so intuitive and beautiful. This show really does explore into the deaf culture, which is something that hearing people (unless they have someone deaf they know) never think about or know about.",1333497600,,289,4.686274509803922

4603358,5,B0058YPH5G,"This TV show on ABC Family is about two teenager girls name, Bay Kennich (Vanessa Morano) and Daphne Vassquez (Katie Leclerc) who was Switched at Birth.  Bay grew up in a wealthy family, with her married parents and older brother Toby (Lucas Grabeel) .  On the other hand Daphne is deaf and is raised by a single mom and is living in a working class neighborhood.  Watch the TV Show on Tuesdays on ABC Family. You will love the show.",1327104000,,433,4.3875
4603359,5,B0058YPH5G,"I absolutely love Switched at Birth. I am an American Sign Language major in college, so I was interested in seeing this show. I was instantly hooked and the ASL is surprisingly good. I was expecting the ASL to be sketchy, at best, but I was pleasantly mistaken. I love how the three actors that play the main deaf characters are actually deaf or hard of hearing in real life. No one can play a deaf character than a deaf actor. I also love the chance to freshen up on my deaf culture a little bit and learn a new sign or two. I would recommend this show to anyone. In fact, almost my entire Sing II class is now hooked, including my professor! Give this show a chance, and I promise you won't be disappointed.",1327017600,,710,4.227941176470588
4603360,5,B0058YPH5G,"This is a wonderful show! In fact this reminds me of my life growing up in the deaf world and while I have now received Cochlear Implants done on both of my ears, that has changed my life forever and hear just like any normal hearing person. So by watching or buying this DVD show incorporates both the hearing & deaf world and the problems each encounters. You won't regret watching this!",1326931200,2,389,4.416666666666667
4603361,5,B0058YPH5G,"This is such a great show that incorporates both hearing and deaf cultures and the problems each encounters. Plus it's also full of juicy drama, great acting and all the other good stuff that gets you glued to the tv for hours on end. If you haven't watched it already you definitely should buy the dvd!",1325721600,,303,4.428571428571429
4603362,5,B0058YPH5G,"I also thought,oh - cheesy - but was in the mood so to speak; it would be OK if it were not that great.  But the acting and  the characters are really really well done.  Very sharp series.
Very glad it is continuing.  You can't - well, I can't - seem to settle on a favorite person.  All the members of the families are human - with some truly wonderful qualities and some difficult traits.  Very honest show.",1325635200,,409,4.17948717948718
4603363,3,B0058YPH5G,"I don't watch a lot of current TV, preferring some of the older, classic stuff.  But I became very fond of this show very, very quickly.  It's not without the occasional contrivances, and there are times when a ""situation"" is conveniently wrapped up in 45 minutes, but this is a TV show, after all.  All around, though, this program has some of the best characters - both written and acted - that you are likely to see.  The two lead actresses are really worth their weight in gold, but the whole ensemble cast is really well drawn out - not a bad actor among them.  I liked this show so much that I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop: For it to start out good and then turn silly, but so far it hasn't happened.  My only quip with this DVD is that it only contains 10 episodes.  Why not just include all the episodes from the TOTAL first season once they've aired?  But anyway, check this show out if you haven't.  You might be surprised how quickly you get hooked.",1325376000,,971,4.262295081967213
4603403,5,B0058YPH5G,"First of all, my complaint:  This DVD is only for the first half of season one.  I recommend that people stop buying these partial-season DVDs so that the producers get the message and stop ripping people off.  As for the program, I really like it that actors who play the deaf characters are really deaf (or hearing impaired)  and I enjoy watching the signing (even though I don't know ASL).  It's a beautiful language.  The only major complaint I have with the story is that Bay, who is raised in a very Wasp environment, is a ""graffiti-artist"" which is ""explained"" when she finds out that she's half Puerto Rican.  Talk about stereotyping!  I also think that Katie LeClerc (Daphne) doesn't really look like a sixteen year-old high school girl.  Perhaps that's because she's really 25.  But she does a terrific job so I can overlook the age discrepancy.  In general the show is great(if a bit too PC) and I'd recommend it to anyone.  Just wait for the full season DVD.",1323820800,14,970,4.608187134502924
4603404,5,B0058YPH5G,"Love love LOVE Switched at Birth.  The characters are so relatable and it is just sooooo good.  There is some really good sarcastic humor and I just LOVE to see the ASL banter.  Normally, I'm not much of a teenage-drama-mushy-abc family kinda fan, but this series is just so different and utterly enjoyable.  So funny, emotional and just feel-good fun. You're just craving to see what'll happen next week.  I literally laugh out loud at times. LOVE Daphne, Bay, Emmett, the moms, everyone.  My husband TOTALLY SUPRISINGLY, loves it too.  He just asked me the other day, ""So when does that deaf show start again?""  Can't wait til January for the next half of the season and for the dvds to come out. It's also making me want to learn ASL and teach my 10 month old son too.  In fact, I looked up some common baby signs to teach him after a few episods. LOVE THIS SHOW! WANT MORE! AHHHHHHH!!",1323043200,,888,4.46583850931677
4603405,5,B0058YPH5G,"I saw the trailer for this show but never actually watched it so I was excited to watch it for myself to see what I was missing. What I liked best about this show was that it incorporates characters and issues about being deaf into the show itself. Too often these days you do not see deaf characters in shows so the deaf culture in America remains invisible. I commend this show for bringing this into the show. Outside of this though I found the characters to be completely believable and the plot of the story was engaging and entertaining. You will find that the messages with the show are family friendly and that it does get into issues of relating adoption as well as family values, parenting and unconditional love. It was a great show and I hope that it continues in the future.",1322870400,,787,4.43448275862069
4603406,5,B0058YPH5G,"I love this show! I never knew about how it was for deaf people before I watched it. I looked up the guy who plays Emmet. He was born deaf. He's a great guy and very, very cute! I've been waiting and waiting for this show to come back on the air! When???",1321747200,,254,3.811320754716981
4603407,5,B0058YPH5G,"Okay, the title may seem exaggerated, but it's pretty close to being the truth. I don't think any TV show in the past which included deaf actors or focused on the deaf culture ever came as close to ""Switched at Birth"" (SAB) when it comes to the affecting the Hearing audience. The sheer number of Hearing people wanting to learn ASL and learn about the deaf culture is staggering. Even the celebrated ASL Comedian Keith Wann said that he and his business partner ""Wink"" have worked hard for years to try to bridge the gap between the deaf and hearing communities through their comic routines, but that SAB and the up-and-coming deaf teenage heartthrob, Sean Berdy, was doing it in mere months (if that).

ASL teachers all over the country were warned about the potential sudden increase in students signing up for ASL class, particularly the teenage female students. This is of course partly due to Sean Berdy, but the show itself is addicting.

The premise seems simple enough - two teenagers discover that they were switched at birth and their families try to sort through their lives with this new discovery. One of the girls is deaf. That's about the one thing that made this story even more interesting and one that brought the deaf culture into the series.

This show could very well be like a launching point for the movement to get more of the hearing community to understand that deaf people are not ""handicapped"" or ""impaired"" in any way, and maybe ASL will become more widely used to the point where a deaf or HoH person can walk into any store and be able to communicate with the sales clerks. OK so maybe that's a long ways away yet, but still, it would be a start!

I'm Hearing, and thanks to this show, both my hearing children (both under 10) are beginning to learn ASL. I think if all children took some ASL class in elementary school, maybe one day ASL will be like a second language in the U.S. And if that happens, ""Switched at Birth"" will surely make it into the history books!

Yes, it's that good. Watch the series!

22 more episodes will be coming in, starting in the first week of January 2012.",1318809600,,2119,4.548556430446194

Interesting premise and it's easy to imagine that it could happen, especially since there were a few cases years ago.  The characters are believable, storylines interesting and the acting is excellent, especially the girls who play Daphne and Bay.  The only problem I have with it is how fast Bay and her Mom seemed to learn sign language...I would imagine it is quite a long, involved process before you could really carry on a conversation like they do on the show.  Otherwise, great show and I am looking forward to it coming out on DVD and the next season.",1316390400,3,671,4.520661157024794

I love this TV shows and I felt this show would to give a great example to help the hearing people understand better about deaf culture as I hope they will give them wake up. I feel the same way as Daphane about her experience, but she is hard of hearing. I'm not hard of hearing but will do when I need a speech thraphy in the future. I really tired of the hearing people doesnt know how to communcation with Deaf people as sometimes I can't read their lip as fast as I prefer they use write the paper, but some people won't bring the paper when they keeps talking till said oh, paper and pencil.

It is enlightening for hearing persons to get exposure to life as a deaf person, several of whom are featured characters in this series.  ASL and captioning are used extensively so hearing persons should be prepared to sit and watch closely....no must-tasking. I learned a lot and plan to introduce the series to my grandchildren (tweens and teens).  The deaf actors starring in this series are excellent, especially the always-luminous Marlee Matlin. Deaf actor, Sean Berdy, is also appealing and excellent. By series four, unfortunately, the writers seemed to rely on one tear- fest plot  after another.
