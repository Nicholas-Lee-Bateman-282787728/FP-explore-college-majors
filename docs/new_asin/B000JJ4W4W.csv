8150796,3,B000JJ4W4W,Thr story itself is good but this particular RR episode feels disjointed. They didn't seem to know where to go with it. I would have loved to learn more about Mali and it's customs but the video talked about going to the dentist and then a 15 year old latina girls birthday. Very odd episode...,1490054400,,294,4.363636363636363
8150797,4,B000JJ4W4W,"My child lost a library DVD that is no longer being produced. Even though the DVD is several years old, the NY library system wanted $30 for it. I was able to buy another one from this merchant for less than half that. The shipping I opted for was regular mail, but I rec'd it with no problems. I would definitely purchase from them again.",1255651200,,339,4.230769230769231
