6120005,5,B00GVDCAWG,"Wonderful visuals, a clear, concise and engaging narrative, this provides a good introduction to the Harvey company's impact on marketing the Southwest  in addition to the story of the Harvey Girls.  I wish it had been longer, and had included information about the women who worked as guides for the cultural detours - the primary focus is on the women who worked in the hotels and restaurants.  Perhaps there will be a sequel...I hope so!

I live in the Upper Midwest so it hasn't been shown on my local PBS station.  I watched it on Vimeo.",1415923200,,542,4.604166666666667

6120008,5,B00GVDCAWG,"I found this DVD history of the life and work of Fred Harvey very interesting -- as a part of my (possible) family history. I remember the movie musical that told the story, but it didn't go into the facts.

6120010,5,B00GVDCAWG,"This is an amazing, engaging, and beautifully produced documentary about some incredible women in history!  My grandmother is one of the women featured on this dvd, and it was wonderful getting to hear her voice again!  Mrs. Zada Sharon said that working with the crew was a wonderful experience, and that getting to share her story with a wider audience was important to her!  I highly recommend this dvd to anyone interest in history, women's rights, or the WW2 era!  Beautiful story, beautifully produced! Thank you so much Mrs. Katrina Parks!",1390435200,4,546,4.967032967032967

Woven through the voices of Harvey Girls themselves, this documentary spans fifty years. A flowing account of how the Harvey Company transformed the face of pioneers, adding ladies to the menu. Stephen Fried is the film's balancing factor, cutting to the chase with insightful snippets clarifying the journey of America's most famous workforce, the Harvey Girls!",1385424000,5,454,5.791044776119403
6120012,5,B00GVDCAWG,"The Harvey Girls is a film that takes a significant in depth look at how Fred Harvey migrated from Europe to the United States and helped to change the minds of how women were perceived in the workplace. The film is artful, inspirational as well as educational with candid accounts from Harvey Girls who are delightful and teach you about how new roads were paved by their brave actions to join the workforce while so many criticized their decisions. You will be entertained and educated by this remarkable story. Accolades to Katrina Parks who proves herself as an incredible filmmaker.",1385337600,6,587,4.88
