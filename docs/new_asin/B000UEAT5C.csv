8213062,3,B000UEAT5C,"I have mixed feelings about this DVD. I bought it because I am trying to learn Italian and I like that it includes some tech-talk vocabulary. It does have some very useful vocabulary, and the speakers use excellent pronounceation, even if they do talk a bit fast during the phrases and dialogue. I don't mind the speed because all of my other Italian language DVDs seem too slow, and this one seems more realistic. I also like that it is easy to repeat segments. Another good feature is that there are several choices for the learner's native language. I am also trying to learn Japanese, and it was fun to listen to the intoductions in Japanese.

I don't like that it is very tedious to navigate through the tracks, especially for vocabulary. After each lesson, it stops and you have to hit the navigation button or forward button on your remote to go to the next track. For the vocabulary, this means that you have to hit the button after each word. I don't mind this feature as much when I really need to repeat a track, but it would be nice to have the option of just watching the lessons. For some reason the DVD player seems to have to hunt for the track each time I hit the forward button. It is slower than navigating through consecutive scenes in a movie. Another thing I am not crazy about is that the video portion is limited to still photos in some cases. The actual Italian pronounciation is usually in video, but not always.",1203465600,5,1438,4.446969696969697
