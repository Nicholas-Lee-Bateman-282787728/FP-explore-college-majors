6516782,4,B00LYHXGCC,"This was a good upper body and cardio workout.  I also like that I get to use my step which has been gathering dust. I am pretty fit and I felt my back muscles and chest the next day. I just wish there was a little more focus on legs and abs. Then again, it would have had to be a longer video. All in all, I recommend this workout to change up your routine.",1417910400,,358,3.7733333333333334
6516783,5,B00LYHXGCC,"I'm sorry some not liking this but for a good cardio burn and metabolism booster, this is awesome.  I do it in between my lifting days and I'm loving it.  Short, sweet and a lot of burn packed in 30 minutes.",1398988800,,207,4.024390243902439
6516784,4,B00LYHXGCC,"This workout is good for days I want cardio but also upper body weight work without having to do compound moves. It's true Tabata style in that Coffey-Meyer does the same move eight times in 20 seconds intervals with 10 seconds rest in between, so if exercisers find that type of thing too repetitive, they may not like it. But I thought there was enough variety to keep me interested. My only complaint is that there's no specific biceps work. I had to tack that on at the end. An abdominal session would have been nice, too, but overall I enjoyed this workout as I do most of Coffey-Meyer's DVDs. She's always motivating and encouraging.",1390953600,3,639,4.565217391304348
6516785,1,B00LYHXGCC,"Was so disappointed with this one-I had ordered directly from Kelly's website as soon as it came out because I have a bunch of her other strength dvds that I love. Not only did I find it pretty dull without her ""girls""in the background,but the jumping on and off the step I hated. I heard that a lot of people were also disappointed with her other latest dvd Trim Down. That one I passed on because I really don't enjoy boxing. I guess maybe Kelly is running out of ideas. I sold this on ebay after using it once-I actually didn't even do the whole workout as I was really not having fun.",1390608000,2,588,4.212389380530974
6516786,3,B00LYHXGCC,this DVD was 'ok'.  Unfortunately not intense enough for me (advanced exerciser).  Would be a good intro to those wanting a circuit or tabata style workout,1388534400,3,155,4.923076923076923

8669115,4,B00LYHXGCC,"I have several of Kelly's 30 Minutes to Fitness DVDs, and this one is the hardest. The tabata drills (I modified to do on the floor; did not use a step) are extremely challenging and your heart rate will soar. This is a smart way to work out. I give four stars instead of five as the weight work was all upper body (some worked your core as well)--I am sore from my waist up but there was no lower body weight work. The plyo drills for the cardio do work your legs, but it is not the same as strength training for your legs. I find Kelly always goes too heavy on the upper body, and this was true in this case as well. Would have been perfect if she had subbed in two lower body weight training tabatas for some of the upper body work. Also, no bicep work included. But still a very solid workout.",1449878400,3,797,4.050632911392405
8669116,5,B00LYHXGCC,"This is a tough workout but I love it. I am about 60lbs overweight. This is a challenging workout but If I can do it then anyone can. The jumps are killer so for now I modify them by stepping up and down instead. I work at my pace knowing that if I keep this up eventually I will get stronger. I love the Tabata workout, I don't get bored and actually look forward to working out w this video. The instructor is low key and encouraging without being annoying.",1447372800,,459,4.111111111111111
8669117,5,B00LYHXGCC,"Love this!! Good focus for legs and arms, but good full body work out.",1446076800,,70,4.071428571428571
8669118,4,B00LYHXGCC,"I do really like this new DVD. My only issue is that her warm up requires lots of jumping and she doesn't offer any modifications.  Once into the DVD and the workout, the exercises are pretty good and I can figure out my own modifications needed, but the voice that tells you when to start and stop is very SOFT and hard to hear. Overall a good DVD.",1444780800,2,349,4.132352941176471
8669119,5,B00LYHXGCC,"I have several of Kelly's workouts.  This one really keeps you hopping and sweating for the entire 30 minutes.  It gives a really well balanced cardio/weight workout.  I was not familiar with what exactly this workout would be before ordering, but be familiar with Kelly's other workouts I knew that it would deliver regardless.  Glad I took a chance and tried this one out.  If you are looking for something a little different to mix things up, give this one a try - you will not be disappointed!",1429747200,,497,4.6022727272727275
8669120,5,B00LYHXGCC,"I love Kelly's 30 minute workouts - I have several of them because I like the intensity and the 30 minute time frame, plus she's fun without being unprofessional or annoying.  This is one of my favorites - some people don't like that she's the only one exercising, but I actually like it.  It feels like it's just Kelly and me - and she's struggling along with me!  The workouts are great - it has become one of my go-to dvd's - and I have a lot of them to choose from!  The countdowns are fun.  I wouldn't suggest you use this as your only strength workout if you are advanced level - I use it in conjunction with more focused, comprehensive strength workouts at least once a week  - but if you push yourself and go heavy with your weights, this one will deliver a heart-pumping,very effective workout.  You get out what you put in with this one for sure.",1427673600,4,856,4.279503105590062
