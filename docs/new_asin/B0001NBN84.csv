8015913,4,B0001NBN84,"I remember watching this game when it originally aired and it was a GREAT game!  The Colorado Buffaloes won 10-9 over Notre Dame.  However, Raghib ""Rocket"" Ismail had an incredible punt return TD called back because of a clipping penalty.  Had the return counted, Notre Dame would have won the game.

I don't recall if the Colorado Buffaloes won the national championship as a result of this game... I only recall that there was some controversy over who should have won because Georgia Tech was the nation's only unbeaten team.",1207094400,2,528,4.833333333333333
