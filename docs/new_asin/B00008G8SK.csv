Sonny Chiba never had the charisma or fighting skills of Bruce Lee, but then he never pretended he did. He delivered something totally different - gritty, dirty violence; no posturing; bucketfulls of blood. As usual with Eastern movies, particularly of this time period, there's little by way of plot, so what gives this an edge is that Chiba's character is VERY unlikeable. So why root for him? Because he dispatches even more unlikeable characters in some very gruesome ways. He's your typical anti-hero.

So, if you like low plot, high violence movies (and you're curious why Tarantino was so desperate to get Chiba in Kill Bill), take a look at this flick - it really is cool!",1177804800,,788,4.837037037037037
