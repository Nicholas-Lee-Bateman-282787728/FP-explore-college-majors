8619111,2,B00FXAP4T4,"Philo Vance returns; a less than dynamic sleuth.

Surprise, another convoluted plot with a twist ending! It seems this genre fell into a rut of constructing stories to keep us ""armchair detectives"" in a state of confusion until the hero pulls it all together at the end. There's always the red herring and the murderer is always a character beyond reproach. We even get the comic sidekick.

Well, nothing new here. We're expected to accept the ""facts"" of the case without question. I can't give any detail w/o revealing the ending. It was too much of a stretch for me.",1531785600,,568,4.67

8619113,3,B00FXAP4T4,"The film is good, however this transfer has some problems. It is watchable but there is a issue about 3/4 the way that the video gets squeezed, there is a black bar on the right side of the screen. I hope a better version comes along, only buy it if you can find it cheap as I did.",1509926400,,281,3.8620689655172415

8619119,5,B00FXAP4T4,"GREAT PRC B picture, and very rare. However, this release from something called Mr Fat W Video, is a total mess. The print is fine, in fact it's beautiful. They ruined the how film by doing some very heavy DVNR which makes the image a total blurr. When the actors are still it's beautiful, but when there is any movement the image jerks and blurrs to the point that it gives you a headache.
Hopefully, someday a real distributor will release these great films.

UPDATE: My mistake. I was playing this on an older Sony player from 2004 which could not read the disc when scanning beacuse of the digital cleanup on the image. I ran it on a newer player and WOW BEAUTIFUL image! Get this by all means.
GOOD GOING MR FAT W Video!",1393977600,10,725,4.330882352941177
8619120,4,B00FXAP4T4,"This detective should have been called Boston Blackie, rather than Philo Vance, since there is little resemblance here to the Philo Vance mysteries that were created by S. S. Van Dine. He could be any private investigator. The plot is interesting with plenty of suspects and bodies falling on a regular basis. Philo's sidekick was supposed to be a Russian and he made the whole production more interesting. He truly was a comic relief. Enjoyable for fans of old murder mysteries.",1387238400,11,479,4.925925925925926
