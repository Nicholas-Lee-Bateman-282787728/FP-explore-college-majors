8071326,4,B000A0GXLA,"If you pick up an Irish Tin Whistle, you will soon be playing.  however, if you want to move on past ""Mary Had a  Little Lamb"" you will likely need some instruction.  This is a good DVD for just that purpose, especially learning some of the little ""tricks"" and 'insider' information on how to play some great Irish Music.

The camera work is fine, with nice close ups.  Although this DVD starts out for the person just beginning the Irish Tin Whistle, you will need to, as time progresses, pause the DVD and go and practice, and then return to the next ""lesson"".  The DVD does not break down and pause in a lesson form, so you will have to go at your own pace, and stop it when you need to break away, take a week and practice.

I learned from an excellent player this great tip:  because Tin Whistles are so inexpensive, leave one in your car.  He practices at red lights and in traffic!  If you live in a high traffic area, you will improve quickly on this little tid-bit.

enjoy the DVD and check out the other instructional DVDs from Homespun. com sold here at Amazon.  As a guitarist, I have built up a large library of Homespun's teachings.",1178150400,20,1146,4.328638497652582
