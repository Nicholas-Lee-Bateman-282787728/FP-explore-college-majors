8471147,3,B004YCKJ24,"I had seen ""Impostor"" a number of times before, but it was even more enjoyable now that I read Philip K. Dick's short story right before watching it again and seeing both the similarities and differences in the two media. I had never heard of ""Final Encounter,"" and there was good reason - epic fail!! Didn't even finish it and wasn't even curious enough about the ending to wonder what happened after I took the disc out of the player.",1528934400,,436,4.4625
8471148,4,B004YCKJ24,"I bought this movie strictly for ""Impostor,"" which is a good thing. ""Final Encounter"" is a pretty sorry excuse for a feature film. But, it's not like it was an expensive purchase, so if you liked, ""Impostor"" (or perhaps other movies based on Phillip K. Dick short stories), it's worth it.",1488758400,,288,4.666666666666667
8471149,3,B004YCKJ24,"if you're into sci-fi and haven't seen these two, then buy them. otherwise, you can skip it and move along.",1447113600,,107,4.4
8471150,4,B004YCKJ24,"Impostor is GREAT.  Worth the price. As a 'bonus', you get another movie 'Final Encounter'.  I was personally not impressed YMMV, but Impostor alone is worth WAY more than the price of the disc, quality is great, and one more DVD replaced in my collection!",1416614400,,256,4.666666666666667
8471151,5,B004YCKJ24,"Impostor is worth this purchase alone! Gary sinise and Madeleine Stowe make a believable and sympathetic couple ,but is he or isn't he a alien? Good drama and suspense!",1395014400,,168,4.827586206896552
8471152,3,B004YCKJ24,The product condition was great and the movies were entertaining but not something you would watch again and again. But was okay.,1361750400,,129,4.909090909090909
