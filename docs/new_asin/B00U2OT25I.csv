8704052,4,B00U2OT25I,"A quick word about the Blu-ray audio quality on offer here. In a word, it sounds much better than the Naxos CD. It is less brash, certainly more refined, atmospheric and spacious than the CD.

Naxos offers it in DTS surround sound and 2-channel PCM. The above comments apply to the latter. The surround format is even more spacious and lovely, as to be expected. But make no mistake, even in stereo PCM, this Blu-ray is much improved over the CD.

I found the performances somewhat disappointing when originally listening to the CD. This Blu-ray does nothing to improve that observation. These readings sound like, well, readings rather than performances. They remain just a touch too careful and buttoned-down - especially when compared to the likes of Leonard Bernstein and Arthur Fiedler in this repertoire. Worse, they frankly are not all that well played. The Blu-ray reveals even more glaringly than does the CD some less than stellar playing and unity of ensemble here and there. One might think this could add a sense of spontaneity; but rather, it instead tends to sound like they're sight-reading.",1529625600,,1107,4.946236559139785
