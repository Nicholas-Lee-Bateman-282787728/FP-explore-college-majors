5891969,5,B00E688B8A,this is a series that revolves around the romantic comedy genre. the character development is perfect and this series is very uplifting. it helps you feel relaxed and cheerful. at least for me. one of my favorites,1399507200,,213,4.783783783783784
5891970,5,B00E688B8A,"This is a greate season and if you watch kanon, clanad, angel beats play any of Kay games and like it you will love this show to it's more lay back then the others title more of a comedy funny situations but it still have the drama and hard braking part in it not so sad as kanon but a great story, lovely characters and if you know other titles you will see that characters are very simalear not only in the appirenc :} any way if you looking for a good anime comedy/drama this title is for you I watch it some time a go in jap audio and know it's out on blueray and in dub so what are you waiting for go and buy the 2. Parts when they will be out that's what I will do :}",1387411200,3,673,3.780141843971631
5891971,3,B00E688B8A,"Its generic anime. Very generic. If you've never seen an anime based on a Japanese adult game, you'll probably find it rather good. It does have some decent story moments. There is also a season two which is airing in Japan right now. But for those that have seen these before, you won't see anything new. Characters are very generic. The main character is bland and if it wasn't for the supporting cast there wouldn't be any story.

Busters also relies heavily on traditional anime storytelling tropes. Characters act in set patterns and you'll see a lot of moments that are just extremely predictable. Season two gets a bit better since the series starts to get plot elements which aren't that predictable. Things get interesting. But there is a high chance this release will not include season two.

My rating mostly reflects my experience with this genre. I personally almost let this series slide multiple times as it was airing just because I found many scenes just so cliche that I just about had it since it was combined with such generic characters. But, if I rate it without knowledge of other anime, it would be close to 5/5. So take it as you will. Its not bad on it's own. I can see why it was approved of getting an anime.

This isn't a waste of time like other anime series which get aired and you shake your head at what idiot approved them. For those that like it, I can't look down on you. By all means enjoy it. This series is worth a rental if not purchase. For those on the fence, watch some episodes online first to be sure if you like it, or rent it.",1385596800,5,1573,4.417241379310345
5891972,5,B00E688B8A,"I watched little busters the drama, tradegy, romance and i don't care what people said this anime fulfills my dream to get it on DVD On black friday i'll buy it for sure unlike everybody would, Little Busters comes out next week on November 19. I will buy it even it has 13 Episodes",1384214400,7,282,4.2407407407407405
5891973,5,B00E688B8A,"The rating itself is for the series, as it is far from the series' fault that the title is misleading and Amazon/Sentai haven't done a thing to change it.

The show itself is very funny, there's alot of cute girls wearing skimpy outfits and just genuinely being adorable for 26 episodes, i shan't give anything away, if you're interested look up the plot and characters on Wiki or something, but i assure you this is a VERY enjoyable and easy-to-watch series along the lines of the anime behemoth that is Lucky Star, K-On! and Azumanga.

My problem comes with the misleading title, and as i've stated, this won't affect my rating of the show itself, coming in at a total run time of 325 mins, this will only cover this first half of the first series, now this would be fine if Sentai had announced that the series would come in two separate parts, which, to my knowledge, they haven't, which makes me weary of if only having 13 episodes was intentional or if it was just a HUGE mistake on Sentai's part, none-the-less, i will not be buying until i can clearly see that all 26 episodes are available to purchase.",1383177600,5,1111,4.4950495049504955
5891974,2,B00E688B8A,"At only 325 minutes, this is only episodes 1-13 out of 26 episodes in season 1. It is most definitely not a complete collection. It's a good series which builds throughout as Riki adds more girls to the team. By episode 13 he was just started on that process, and some of the best characters become involved later. By all means, buy this set, as it is very worthwhile. I'll be interested in checking out the English dub, but it will be hard to beat the original Japanese cast. If this set has decent subtitles, I recommend at the least giving the original audio a try. And if you aren't completely sold on the series by the end of part 1, keep in mind that the best episodes are in the second half of the season.

This is a series centered on a boy who suffers from a severe type of narcolepsy, where he can suddenly collapse without warning and sleep for hours or days. As a result, he finds it hard to make friends, especially after his parents die in an accident. Some neighbour kids go out of their way to include him in their group, ""The Little Busters."" As he enters high school, the leader is about to graduate. He decides to create a baseball team centered on the group, and sets Riki the task of recruiting enough members. Riki has an uncanny ability to make friends with a variety of girls.

By the way, season 2 starts in January. It's called Little Busters: Refrain. I look forward to watching it as it comes out in Japan. I always try to buy the shows I like most, provided that they are licensed, which many of the best are not. That's why I don't wait for them to be released. Dog Days has never been licensed, but both of the seasons that have aired were highly enjoyable, and I look forward to season 3 soon.",1379462400,8,1725,4.288343558282208

8601802,2,B00E688B8A,"Unlike Air, Kanon, and Clannad (Which is arguably my favorite anime of all time), this one is made by JC Staff and not Kyoto Animation, and it really shows. There's a huge downgrade compared to those other three Key series The art style is cute enough, deviating enough from the game to be its own thing, but the animation runs from just being plain average to being abysmal. A lot of small short-cuts are taken in regards to the animation, which is such a shame because the other Key anime avoided such things. However, given that this is a show about high school kids doing random things together initially, I suppose animation isn't that important, so how's the story?

The first 13 episodes of this show are very boring!

It takes a LONG time to introduce each character (and there's a lot of them here!), with one of them not being formally introduced until episode 10, which, in my opinion, was by far the most boring episode of the show. In addition to that, there are a few episodes that are easy to identify as filler, even if you haven't played the game, simply due to the fact that the plot comes at a complete standstill during these episodes. There was also the feeling of it being rushed - there are two of them girl's routes in these first thirteen episodes, and both of them are resolved within three episodes. It wouldn't be so bad if they cut out some parts of their story, but they tried to cram as much of their plot from the game into those three brief episodes, and it results in it just feeling really rushed. I'll admit, I might be viewing it from a different angle since I've played the game first prior to watching this, so take that into consideration.

It's kind of sad that these first handful of episodes leave such a bad taste though, because the following thirteen are much better, since it starts to get into the more serious elements of the plot from the game, and Refrain - the second season - is leagues better than this. So if you can soldier through these opening episodes, you'll at least be rewarded at the end, but it's a real slog to get through this stuff.

That being said, there are good things. The music for one, is ripped straight form the game, and while some of the tracks are just 'meh', the opening and a few tracks that play are really great. It's one of the few shows that I stayed to watch the opening just because I liked the song so much. And like I said above, I do like the overly cutesy art style they went with this, I think it fits the game pretty well.

So final verdict: These first thirteen episodes aren't very good. They're downright boring, with episode 10 deserving a special highlight for nearly putting me to sleep. Only get this if you're buying all three Blu-Rays, because you'll unfortunately need to watch these episodes to follow along with what happens later.",1432857600,,2836,4.467181467181467
8601803,5,B00E688B8A,"The 4th anime series from the amazing Key Animation studio.  This collection contains the first 13 episodes, and like the previous series it features some of the most loveable and annoying characters in all of anime.  Having not seen the second part of the series, I can only comment on this one.  And I have to say this series is a lot heavier on the comedy than the romance and drama.",1425427200,,386,4.408450704225352
