4733592,5,B005LAIGSM,"""The Vow"" 2012 is a romantic drama with some comedic moments thrown in. Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum play a young married couple whose lives take a tragic fate when they suffer a car accident.

McAdams's character, Paige, isn't horribly disfigured or anything like that, but she suffers brain trauma which has blocked all memory of Tatum's character Leo.

Leo tries to get regain her memory by trying to have her fall in love with him again.

That's the movie. These romantic dramas get manufactured every year, and I have seen hundreds of them. However, I really liked the movie.

It's true that these types of movies aren't original, but that doesn't bother me too much as long as the product is good. Like I said, I liked it primarily because Rachel and Channing were very good in the leads.

It's true that perhaps the ""brain trauma"" aspect of the plot could have been worked a bit more, I mean Paige remembers a lot of things that you wouldn't expect someone whose had brain trauma to remember, so this part of the movie could come out as implausible to some people.

However, most people who have enjoyed the film don't care about that. This is a love story first and foremost, so it's more about seeing the characters going through the motions and trying to get those magic feelings for each other again

The performances are excellent. Channing and Rachel have great chemistry. The acting is never forced and the characters are believable.

Once we learn about Paige's past, we kind of understand why it's hard for her to remember Leo or at least not embrace it: Part of her life has been burdened by her overbearing father (played by Sam Neil) who doesn't quite respect her decisions, an ex-boyfriend Jeremy (Scott Speedman) who can't quite let her go, and other personal issues.

Rachel McAdams plays her character well. She is pretty, nice personality, but a little unsure of herself.

Tatum is good as the guy next door whose willing to put up with a lot all in the name of love. In fact, small parts of the movie are actually narrated by Leo as he tries to tell the audience what love really is. It's a nice addition to make the movie stand out a bit more from just being another movie. I liked his discussion of ""moments of impact"" in the film

All in all it's just a nice romantic movie. Some might find some issues with the science part of the movie or say it's predictable, but it's a movie that you see to make you laugh and feel good at the end.",1328918400,109,2469,4.513452914798206
4733593,1,B005LAIGSM,"There's a review on IMDb of The Vow that says the romance movie ""keeps its distance from clichs and cheesiness,"" and it just made me wonder just what in the hell this person saw that I didn't. The Vow is the story of Leo (Channing Tatum) and Paige (Rachel McAdams), a married couple that is very much in love. One evening, they get into a terrible car accident and Paige loses her recent memory meaning she doesn't remember the love of her life or their relationship. She basically still has a thing for her ex-fianc Jeremy (Scott Speedman) and doesn't understand why she doesn't have her family in her life. Leo does everything in his power to try and remind Paige of the love they once shared, but Paige is showing no signs of recovery.

The one good thing The Vow has going for it is that there is decent chemistry between Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams. There's at least a mild connection between the two and the scenes when they're alone are perhaps the most powerful this romance has to offer. That isn't saying much though since a good portion of their on-screen time together is devoted to them looking longingly at one another, laughing endlessly, or acting like Beaky Buzzard from Looney Tunes. Then when they do open their mouth, the most inane excuse of flattery comes oozing from their lips. You'll debate on punching yourself in the face in hopes of knocking yourself out to prevent seeing the rest of this monstrosity.

Why is it that every time there's a movie like this revolving around a brain injury NOBODY knows anything about it? They all play ignorant or gullible and basically have no clue as to what they have to deal with. You'd think that they would've seen the dozen or so romance films they borrowed from before actually setting out and ripping them off. Rachel McAdams has pretty much been trying to make The Notebook again ever since 2004. There have been some exceptions like Red Eye, Wedding Crashers, and Sherlock Holmes, but everything in between has been along the same lines. It's as if The Vow recycles every Rachel McAdams movie you've ever seen and tries to combine them with the concept from The Lookout or Vanilla Sky, but it feels so regurgitated and so familiar that it comes off feeling like it heavily borrowed from The Number 23 which is the furthest thing from a compliment any movie could ask for. Is there honestly much of a difference between The Vow and The Time Traveler's Wife?

In the meantime, you'll be groaning over every decision Paige makes after the accident. It's not as if Channing Tatum isn't to blame as well as his words and actions are just as mushy as the ones Rachel McAdams makes, but it's the way Paige saying she has to make decisions for herself only to wind right back where she started is what makes the entire concept, the actor's performances, and the entire movie totally and completely pointless. Channing Tatum plays guitar in one sequence that'll just make you hope and pray he doesn't break into song. Just because you have brain damage doesn't mean you have to be stupid. Is that a concept that's so hard to grasp? Leave it to a movie labeling itself as a romance being capable of triggering feelings of disgust, frustration, and hatred for fictional characters you probably haven't ever felt this strongly before.

The Vow IS extremely clich and cheesy. Emotions are forced, sappy scenes go on way too long, and the movie is nothing but a string of stupid decisions. The Vow illustrates that nothing stands in the way of fate and even if you had the chance to do things over again that you'd follow the exact same path even if it wasn't your intention. This point is idiotic. Given the opportunity, why would you want an important event in your life to go down exactly the same way? The entire movie comes off as a complete waste of time. The Vow is the prime example of regression, moving backwards in life, or perhaps standing still for entirely too long. The Vow is typical and forcefully romantic trite that will make you wish you get into a car accident on the way home in hopes of getting your own form of brain damage to keep you from remembering this God awful excuse of a movie.",1328745600,21,4173,4.589812332439679

4734103,4,B005LAIGSM,"Pretty decent film for a sappy drama.  The leads Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams did a good job holding my attention throughout by making this less dark than it could've been.  Most know the premise at this point.  A young married couple who are glued to the hip and forever overjoyed in love for years end up in a car accident.  It's not as horrific as it sounds and the film quickly speeds things along to get to the point, which is the Rachel McAdams character ends up in a temporary coma.  When she wakes up she has no recollection of the Channing Tatum character and that she's married to him.  Her last memories were with her parents played by Sam Neill and Jessica Lange, as well as her precious fianc.

The movie is basically the Channing Tatum character trying his dardnest to help the Rachel McAdams character remember her life with him, but she's pulled back into her life before she met him.  Her feelings are still with her previous fianc who she walked out on, but doesn't remember doing that.

In reality, I doubt there are that many people that would be disappointed to wake up to find that someone who looks like Channing Tatum is actually their husband, and to find out that he's also a caring compassionate guy on top of that.  Basically perfection.  In the movie, she's not that impressed by him and keeps getting pulled to her previous life before him.

I thought this story was a little ridiculous or far fetched, only to learn that it's loosely based on true events about a couple who had a similar situation happen to them.  They are allegedly still together today with two kids, even though the wife has no recollection of her marriage to her husband before her coma.  For what it's worth this was still an enjoyable film.",1502409600,,1749,4.528662420382165

4734109,3,B005LAIGSM,"Pros: I liked that the film had more substance than the trailer conveyed;

Cons: stripped away any mention of God in order to make it more Hollywood suitable

 The moment of impact proves potential for change

the plot

Leo and Paige Collins are a happily married couple, both artists living in the city of Chicago. They are young and mainly hang out with each other and their artsy friends. One night while driving home in the snow, Leo stops at a stop sign when Paige makes one of her sexual advances toward hIM. His eyes are fixated on her unbuckling her seatbelt in a sultry fashion and he doesnt notice the truck about to slide into them from the rear. The impact sent Paige through the front windshield; the two are rushed to the hospital where Leo learns that his wife is in a coma. When she wakes up she doesnt remember him or that he is her husband. She doesnt remember that she is an artist or lives in the city. But she doesnt suffer form total amnesia, she remembers her life from five years ago, living with her parents in the affluent suburbs, attending law school and engaged to an old flame named Jeremy.

Paige took the doctors advice and went home to live with Leo to get into her usual routine to speed up her memory recovery. She stayed a couple of days, but although Leo tried to remain patient, he eventually scared her off when he lost his cool and showcased his frustrations. Paige went back home to her parents house and told Leo that shell stay there to help her engaged sister Gwen until the wedding with plans and such. Meanwhile she enjoyed catching up and reconnecting with old friends, including Jeremy. Leo feels more and more like a roadblock instead of Paiges choice. Will Paige ever regain her memory? Can Leo win her back somehow?

the breakdown

The subject of romantic films that feature the subject matter of memory loss has been mostly tackled by the rom-com genre, in my mind anyway. Theres been Adam Sandlers 50 First Dates, Gary Marshalls Overboard, or even Regarding Henry starring Harrison Ford, although this last one had some more dramatic elements in it. For me, The Vows subject is a bit darker. The commercial and trailers give the impression that Rachel McAdams character Paige has lost her memory and Channing Tatum is burdened with the task of reconnecting with her. While this is true, there is a major development, she remembers the life that she lived before she met her husband. As far as shes concerned, this is five years ago, she is a law student, she is engaged to a dip named Jeremy and she has frosted blonde hair. She has no recollection of letting her hair go natural, getting a tramp stamp on her back, moving to the city, becoming an artist and falling madly in love with and marrying Leo. In fact Leo is now viewed as a barricade between her and her happiness. I liked the twist, and I was drawn into the story as the events were essentially relived by Paige, and as expected we await to see what had happened all those years ago to happen again to push Paige away from her family and back to Leo in the city.

While it didn't go down exactly like this, the plot had a couple of more twists to throw off the viewer. Rachel McAdams is a beautiful actress whose appearance helped her character cultivate validity. Her frustrated attitude and the way she jumped at nearly every touch from Leo was quite forceful. It also helped the viewer feel the frustrating demeanor he felt as he found that it was he himself that was the one standing in his own way and he couldn't do a thing about it. I never noticed this about Channing Tatum, but hes a dedicated mumbler much like Harrison Ford has become. He forces you to turn the volume way up. The casting was good enough, Sam Neill as the snooty, wealthy lawyer who thinks his daughter is too good for her husband. Jessica Lange looks extra old especially for her real age, she looks more like Paiges grandmother not her mother.

I haven't read the book, but on Wikipedia it gives a little background on the origin of the story. Just as the film alerts us is based on a true story. Its based on the real life trauma which occurred in the lives of the couple Kim and Krickitt Carpenter.  Yet, while Krickitt had lost her memory in an automobile accident, it was the couples shared faith in Jesus Christ and how they view the holiness of their wedding vows that bound them together through this rough patch in their lives. It bothers me that this story had to be secularized in order for it to be Hollywood ready. In fact, not only did they remove Jesus from the story, they changed the main characters into the opposite of a couple of Christians. No, Im not talking Simon LeVay here, but worse, secular folks who believe that God is last on their list, instead of first. Where Kim and Krickitts common faith and priorities may have helped save their marriage, the most important fact in the real story, Hollywood found unfit. How sad and pathetic.

I liked the film enough, although I found the reasoning behind some of Paiges life choices a bit weak. I was expecting ultimate betrayal, yet all we get is a judgment in morality. A bit too wishy-washy for me to believe that someone would alter their life so dramatically. The film wasn't what I expected in so many ways, the emotional pay-off was practically void, and the choices made as far as plot twists weren't always the right directions. The film was rated PG-13 for some mild language, Channings naked rear end, and a scene with McAdams in her bra and panties. There was nothing too overtly sexual, no f-bombs, in fact the worse verbal offense went by so quickly, and Channings incessant marble-mouthed mumbling made it almost inaudible. I give this three stars.

Rachel McAdams was given the thankless role of making an unlikable character likable, and until the very end it just didn't work.
Yes, she was wonderful in the Notebook, but that had a heluva great script and she earned her acting chops with it.
This movie has her lose her memory and at that point she runs from her husband and seems to want to live a life surrounded by her wealthy family and ex-fianc.
They wasted the wonderful actress Jessica Lange. She shone in a small bit towards the end. I wonder-why did she take this role?
This was based on a real story of a real woman who loses the last 5 years of her memory in a car accident and her husband tries to win back her love. From what I saw she was NOT worth winning back.

Also, I wish they had given a happier ending, since that's what actually happened in real life.  The ending they gave was optimistic yet ambiguous, which was only partially satisfying to the viewer.  This movie is good for a rainy afternoon.  Otherwise, just read about the true story on the internet, and you'll get a better idea of things.

4734692,3,B005LAIGSM,"I've read the book and watched the movie. They are very different. The main construct is similar but the details have been drastically changed to make it more like what audiences what to see instead of the true story.
Overall, the movie is ok. I really like that it doesn't follow the typical theme of romance movies where everything turns out perfect in the end. However, I never connected to the characters so it doesn't have the emotional grab other movies like The Notebook has. It might be because they start with the accident before you feel how much they love each other. The segmented way you learn about their love makes it harder to root for them as a couple. I wasn't rooting for them to overcome the obstacles but merely passively waited to see what would happen.",1483488000,,775,4.58273381294964

4734995,5,B005LAIGSM,"The Vow must be one of the most romantic and well feeling movies in history if it is not the one! Every romantic genre fan must have watched this movie and put it into ones essentials box. This movie is not only gorgeously filmed and enchants us with its beautiful story, but it also makes us believe in love again, especially, because it is based on a true story.

  As the movie starts off spotting the perfect and gorgeous couple Paige (Rachel McAdams) and Leo (Channing Tatum) walking out of a movie theater on a scenery and snow-flaky night, one instantly falls in love with the couple. As they approach the car to head back home, Leo creates a cozy environment in this cold winter night by showing more than just affection and blowing into Paiges hands to warm them up. Since the beginning of the movie there is a heartwarming and charming flair to it which connects one immediately to these two characters as a dramatic impact on life sets them apart.
The director, Michael Sucsy, does great job at delivering the movie, keeping the audience constantly interested. By providing flashbacks into the couples perfect life before the tragic incident we gain a better understanding of the story and it also fills up holes of the plot. He also manages to deliver the romanticism in a gentle way that is not too pushy and also not blown up, so one leaves the theater with a rather uplifting feeling than being overwhelmed by cheesiness and corny phrases. Also, the soundtracks provide a certain calmness and relaxing tone to the movie, creating a special flair, which underlines the romantic story, and delivers it in a smooth and light way.

  Tatum and McAdams portray this beautiful story in a passionate way, in which they bring in all their experience from past movies like The Notebook and Dear John. Tatum delivers Leos pain, frustration, and broken heart in a human way, holding back and not showing many emotions in the beginning, but then steadily increasing frustration arises in him. His feeling let down face makes one connect to him to an extend that one might recognize oneself in a relatively similar situation, and feel his pain. The climax of acting is at the wedding scene which sets the perfect location for this dramatic development of the story. As Leo opens up his heart to Paige, and lets her know that he is walking away he gives her The Look in which Tatum chooses to not overplay this scene but rather make the audience feel his genuine pain and the feelings behind the impossible decision of how he says How do you look at the girl you love, and tell yourself its time to walk away?. As this scene is decorated with a beautiful stage in the background full of lights, two gorgeous actors, and on top of that a dramatic and sad soundtrack, this scene manages to touch our hearts and fully feel empathy for both characters.

  I have to say this is the greatest romantic movie ever made and it counts to my favorite movies of all time. Not only that the director chose perfect soundtracks to underline the story in a gentle way, but also the camera did a great job on spotting the pain and heartbroken faces of both actors in their dramatic love story. On top of that The Vow is not a typically cheesy and dull love movie, but it has a fairly important meaning and background story to it, and shares a wise analogy of saying that life is defined by moments of impact. The fact that this is a movie based on a true story makes it so much more powerful. If you haven't watched this movie yet make sure to grab a blanket, get cozy and ready to shed some tears, but most important, feel uplifted and leave this movie with a glow in your heart.",1475539200,,3665,4.532526475037821

4735343,5,B005LAIGSM,"I love this movie.  My only complaint is that the speaking parts tend to be too low a volume, so I have to crank up the television and turn on closed captioning to understand certain parts.  I hate it when movies do that, as then other parts will blast you out.

This movie is about a woman who has a brain injury from a car accident.  The accident leaves her with no memory of the last 5 years, including meeting and marrying her husband.  Five years ago, she fit in with her rich crowd.  But the decisions she made with her life changed her and brought her to her husband.  She makes the same decisions the second time around, but her husband has to wait until she becomes the person that he knew before they can share a life together again.

This movie came with an UltraViolet (UV) digital version, which is a plus.  This means that you can put it in the cloud and stream it via your smart TV or a Roku device (which is attached to your tv) or other streaming device.  You can also access UV movies by watching them on your laptop or tablet.  (The UV offer may change, so check the verbage on the product page to make sure that the movie still comes with a digital copy.)  I am currently only purchasing movies with UV copies, so that way I don't have to dig through my Blu-ray or DVD collection to find a movie to watch.  But I still have the hard copy to watch when I lose internet connection due to storms, etc.

My other complaint is not with the movie, but that Amazon dropped the price right after I purchased the movie.  But for under $5, you get the DVD and the digital copy, which is a great deal.",1471651200,,1610,4.181818181818182

I was devastated when a tragedy occurred and Page was in a coma. She woke up and had forgotten most of her previous life. One of the things she forgets is that she is married. Her parents think it is a chance to rekindle the past with their daughter and the dreams they had  for her years before back before their relationship with her was destroyed. Page's parents will try to destory anything that stands in their way of getting their daughter to follow the dreams they have for their daughter. They won't stop at trying to destroy Page's marriage to Leo. While Leo want a nothing more than to rekindle the marriage he and Page once had. It is very easy to see how much he loves and cares for her. It hurts him to see what they have loss. These characters are very well developed. I couldn't help but to want to see them get back what they once shared. This story is emotional. The story is somewhat predictable but it's a journey I enjoyed and kept me hoping the whole time. It made me think about how easy life can change within seconds. I enjoyed watching this love story unfold as the characters gave it their best to get back the life they once knew and to see if they had enough of a connection to fall in love again.",1463529600,,1350,4.2734375

4735789,5,B005LAIGSM,"I had seen this movie before but cannot recall much of it yet bits and pieces though I remember it was based on a true story of a couple who went through the same thing but they re older than the couple Leo & Paige Collins in the movie.
To start Paige and Leo (five years into their marriage) come out of a theater in wintery Chicago and Leo makes a comment about the snow being more than an inch yet Paige says its beautiful then they get to their car and well the rest but how that accident happened was a salt truck with no plow on the front plows into their car, Leo with the seat belt on is okay (minor bumps and such.) yet Paige on the other hand is sent flying through the windshield and lands on the hood of the car. After Paige wakes up in the hospital; she has no memory whatsoever of the last five years she had; as in leaving law school, breaking up with her ex-fiance Jeremy, also finding out about her father's affair with a friend of hers as well. None of that is in her memory even about being married to Leo and attending the Art institute of Chicago along with living with him in downtown Chicago on the north side no less. Both Leo and Paige try to recollect as much as they can of her memories (pictures and other things.) throughout this movie but its when Leo realizes at Paige's sister Gwen's wedding that he cannot do it anymore; that he just gives up as in throwing in the towel because her memory of being with him and everything is completely gone never gonna come back yet later on in the movie Paige makes some startling discoveries about her father's affair with Paige's friend, how her mother didn't want to leave him along with that Paige confesses to her dad (played by the greatest actor: Sam Neil.) about wanting to leave law school and attend the Art Institute of Chicago and get an apartment in downtown Chicago as well. She also again breaks up with (now boyfriend not fiance.) Jeremy as well. I gotta say this movie will have you on your seat from the start to the very end and they've also got deleted scenes plus a majorly funny gag reel in which I must admit is hilarious!! This movie is a must see for anyone who is a couple and romantic!!",1462060800,6,2182,4.247596153846154

4736106,2,B005LAIGSM,"This could have been such a great movie.  I was immediately captivated by the premise described on the back of the movie case:  Shortly after their marriage, Leo and Paige are in a car accident.  When Paige finally comes out of a coma and regains consciousness, she has no memories of the last five years of her life - including her husband Leo or their marriage.  Leo now needs to win back his wife's love - or will Jeremy (someone Paige was engaged to years before) beat him to it?  And why is she estranged from her family, and has her life changed so much?

Sadly the film proved disappointing, and didn't live up to this wonderful premise.  *spoiler alert*  Several plot elements seemed entirely unrealistic (e.g. which husband would organize a big big surprise party for his wife on her first day home from hospital, particular when she's still suffering amnesia and trauma?).  And would a former fiance like Jeremy really capitalize on someone's amnesia and try to rekindle a romance, even though he knows she's mentally fragile and married to someone else?  What's more, the ending is very abrupt and premature, leaving many questions unanswered about what happens next.  The film also lives up to the PG-13 rating, with partial nudity, implied premarital sex, and a sordid extra-marital affair which is part of the background of the plot.

But the biggest disappointment is how little the marriage vow indicated by the title really functioned in the plot. Given that the film is inspired by a true story, I was intrigued enough to do some research about the real life couple that this actually happened to.  Meet Kim and Krickitt Carpenter, who were in an accident 10 weeks after their wedding, leading to Krickett being in a coma for four months, and waking up with no memory of the two preceding years of her life.  In one respect Kim and Krickitt's story is less beautiful than the film's: Krickitt's personality changed, and she was not an easy person to get along with or to love (she could barely stand up) - very unlike Paige in the film, who is beautiful, charming, and so unsurprisingly is the object of competing attentions from two men.  But in another respect Kim and Krickitt's story is more beautiful than the film's.  Krickitt resolves to love Kim simply because of her vow, even though she doesn't remember it.  And Kim resolves to love Krickitt simply because of his vow, even though she is now a very different than the person he married. The couple are Christians, and their true story shows the beauty of sticking to your vows no matter what.

Sadly, none of this comes out in the film - and the marriage ""vow"" isn't the real reason for the love of the film.  Paige doesn't want to love Leo (breaking her vow), even though she's married to him, and Leo even ends up divorcing her (breaking his vow) - something Kim and Krickitt simply ruled out given that it was inconsistent with their vows.  In an interview Kim and Krickitt said: ""You know what's sad, we are getting all of this attention for doing what we said we'd do.  That's the most wonderful part of their story, and sadly that's the very element of their story that Hollywood has purged.  The aspect of being true to your vows, even if the person you're married to changes or becomes difficult isn't really part of the story.  Instead, a wonderful story of genuine love in hardship has been turned into a typical love story of a guy chasing a girl he has feelings for but who doesn't return his affections. The love by which Leo pursues Paige is more about romance and feelings than about the love of commitment and sacrifice in the real-life story of Kim and Krickitt.

Not surprisingly, the film producers wanted to try to make the film appeal to as broad an audience as possible, but by sanitizing it of Kim and Krickitt's Christian faith and values, and turning into a love story that fits the usual Hollywood mould, they've ended up removing the very elements that make Kim and Krickitt's true story so powerful, and eliminating the very message which our culture so desperately needs.  Whether or not you enjoy this movie, do take the time to learn more about Kim and Krickitt, because their story is one worth telling and seeing - even if this film doesn't do a good job of doing it. - GODLY GADFLY (February 2016)",1454284800,,4310,4.6320630749014455

4737114,4,B005LAIGSM,"The Vow
 I was able to see this romantic drama with my sweetie on Valentines Day.  Romantic comedies are the film de jure on such celebratory occasions but I was pleased to try a romantic drama for a change.  I won't dwell on the story too much; you might want to see it.  Let me say that the romance is between a young husband and wife.  The wife suffers a brain injury (for better or worse, in sickness or in health.) that erases quite neatly all remembrances of her husband.  She can however remember quite well her former betrothed.  A complicated and worsening situation then unfolds.
 Channing Tatum, a genuine hunk in case anyone is interested, plays the grieving and aggrieved husband.  He must woo anew his life love.  Tatum is able to exhibit the frustration of a man who cannot reach the woman he has chosen for his lifelong partner.  Who can blame him for his frustration when his lady love is the lovely Rachel McAdams?  The confusion, terror and angst of the injured young wife are clearly conveyed by this fine actress.
 Two of the most respected actors in America play supporting roles.  Sam Niell and Jessica Lange play the estranged parents of the injured wife.  Their very presence adds gravitas and authenticity to this film.
 One of the things that occurred to me right from the opening frames of this movie is just how blessed we are in the expertise of our Hollywood magic makers.  This is not an important film, in the big picture.  But it is good entertainment, which is no small thing.  This is a very smooth, very professional, quite well done film from a technical point of view.  The camera shots are appropriate, the acting just fine and the direction unobtrusive but effective.  This is a fine example of good, solid movie making which makes no claims at greatness.
 The writer/director Michael Sucsy has made an emotionally satisfying film that will please many people.  This is not at all bad for a first time director and a first time writer.  He has reason to be proud.
 As good as this film is from a technical perspective and from an acting perspective, it opens no new ground.  Nor should it be expected to.  It is a date movie that delivers on that basis.  But that restricts it to a bland three saw blades.  It is nothing very special, in other words.  Not that the producers will care.  The film was made with a modest $30 million budget.  Thus far, it has captured some $69 million in worldwide gross.  Dont forget that it is a business and they make things we like to see.
 This PG-13 film runs a fairly short one hour and 44 minutes.  As a movie lover, I would watch it again just to see Sam Neill and Jessica Lange working at this point of their long and celebrated careers.",1427760000,,2719,4.502049180327869

It was a frustrating kind of movie for me. I didn't really connect and neither could I relate to the characters or their reactions to events seemed unrealistic.

4737803,5,B005LAIGSM,"This was such a beautiful movie.  I Luv  Rachel mcAdams. She is so sweet in this movie. I first saw her in Sherlock holms. This movie is about a couple that truly love each other and marry. Based on a true story. They get into a car accident and she looses her memory of the last 5 years. Her husband Channing who was very convincing in his role tries desperately to win her love back,  but she is living in the past. So he gives up with tears and leaves her to her old life. I will not give the end of the movie away but I will say true love and providence wins out. It is so refreshing to see a movie about faithfulness and though sadly God was not ever mentioned , I believe this couple was put together by God , and he blessed their lives together. I bought the movie and was very glad I did. I will watch it over and over again. If you like true love stories that have a happy ending you will love this movie.",1417824000,3,914,3.9565217391304346

 I knew the true story so I wanted to see the move. First of all I didn't think Channing could pull it off, I thought he was a body with no acting skills, so glad I was wrong. This is the best romantic movie, one because it's a true story and two because of the chemistry between Amy and Channing.

4737928,3,B005LAIGSM,"The Hollywood version of Kim and Kricketts story is so far off from the real-life memoir its a stretch to say its based on (I believe the opening credits say inspired by). Yeah, my writing is inspired by lots of things, but its fiction. I don't try to tell a factual story as fiction - which is what this movie does.

Although I thought the book was lacking in emotional punch (see my review), the movie was so Hollywood-ized that it lost whatever might have made it different and interesting.

Personally, I don't care for Channing Tatum as an actor; everything he does seems stilted and wooden. And I don't think hes that great looking (then again, neither was the romantic male in Safe Haven, so whats up with these chick flicks?).

If you hadnt read the book you might think this movie was OK but nothing youll remember a couple years from now. If you HAVE read the book, you might have noticed its not the same story.

The way the characters met and courted was nothing like the memoir (the real-life experience was unusual but not exciting enough for Hollywood Im guessing). The way the car accident happened was not at all accurate. One aspect of the book that I thought was really compelling was that the Carpenters were taken to different hospitals; Kim was badly injured yet LEFT the hospital AMA to get to his wife (whom he thought was dying). There was very little hospital time in the movie.

The months Krickett spent recuperating and relearning simple things (like how to walk) could have been compelling but were completely glossed over.

The family dynamics were completely made up for Hollywood; in actual life, both families were supportive of their efforts to rebuild their marriage.

And the most disappointing thing about the movie? It makes no mention - at all - of God or faith. Im sure thats a Hollywood thing. In the memoir, Kim Carpenter makes a big deal about the fact that they could not have put their marriage back together without faith (which I believe having been there/done that myself though not so dramatically). He also hammers home the fact that they did not consider divorce an option - thats the point of the title The Vow - and yet there they are in the movie, signing divorce papers.

I cant figure out why the Carpenters let this movie be associated with their story, since they were so adamant about the faith thing. Unless they hope it nudges people to pick up their book but if so, readers may be quite surprised (or disappointed depending on what they expected).",1415664000,,2510,4.6247191011235955

4738178,3,B005LAIGSM,"Guy reviewing chick-flick here:
Paige and Leo (Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams) are a cute young couple in love. They live in an artsy loft next to an artsy art studio in a cool trendy part of the city with cool trendy friends. Leo has a recording studio and Paige sculps in the studio. They have been together just under 5 years at this point. They get in a car wreck and Paige loses all memory from the last 5 years. She is instantly NOT a cool artist in a loft, but a rich status concious girl with wealthy parents engaged to a wealthy yuppy type and has NO IDEA who her husband is or why she would be living in such circumstances. I can get amnesia, but turning into a completlely different person seems a bit of a stretch. Leo is very hurt that his wife that he loves dearly has no clue who he is and doesn't seem very happy to be around him. Trying not to spoil things here - she runs off to her family that she had no contact with for the last 5 years. She eventually finds out why she totally changed her life and things head back to normal - The End. As a guy, you will just feel sorry for poor Leo. His wife might as well have had a brain transplant instead of a brain injury. Tatiana Maslany (sp?) from Orphan Black has a part as a recording engineer working for Leo. You would never guess what an amazing actress she turned out to be from this movie. 50 First Dates is a way more entertaining a movie if you like the Amnesia Romance genre.",1412035200,,1453,4.119718309859155

Turns out 'The Vow' is based on a true story. Personally, I prefer the scripted movie with Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore over the true to life.
The comedy/romance of Sandler's movie was understandably replaced with awkward drama and underlying tension that made you feel sorry for poor Channing. Even though Rachel McAdams did a good job, as usual as the charming romantic lead, there was really  not too much to feel good about until the end. By that time it just seemed too late as too much real life had sucked the joy out of the movie.",1399248000,,659,4.446280991735537

it's a feel-good romantic dramedy ""chick-flick"", plain and simple. It was based after a true story, and I have seen the documentary of the couple that this movie was based on somewhere here on Amazon.

Channing Tatum is hot in a devoted but sensitive hunk kind of way, and Rachel McAdams steals the scenes.

There's really not a lot left to say. It will absolutely make you cry, you'll laugh, you'll cry some more, and you'll want to throw things at your screen because life just isn't always fair.",1387929600,,554,4.52

Channing Tatum does a great job as Leo, the husband who is being left behind, and Rachel McAdams is gorgeous, as always, and is the wife Paige who loses her memory. Jessica Lange has a great part as Paige's mother. And of course Tatum isn't hard on the eyes.

4739598,3,B005LAIGSM,"This shows the devastation caused when a loved one receives a brain injury (amnesia in this case).  Rachel McAdams is in a car accident and receives a brain injury that causes her retrograde amnesia, meaning she can't remember the last few years of her life (which happens to include a new boyfriend (Channing Tatum) whom she married!).  He is at a loss of how to handle this situation.  Her parents, who were estranged from their daughter before, try to use this opportunity to get back into her life by trying to take her home with them.  Luckily, the doctor says taking her into her most recent environment may help jog her memory...but that isn't as easy as it sounds.

This causes some funny and some very sad situations.  Tatum's heart is breaking at every rejection from his impaired wife.  She begins to try to reconnect with her ex-fiance because he is a source of familiarity.  There are some great surprising twists we don't see coming.  This is a good romance film.

Hidden just below the surface of The Vow is a hint of a woman (Paige) in conflict, conflict seemingly centered on her father's unfaithfullness & how that clashes with the perfect world she's always known. In truth, however, one can see that Paige's father's affair really had nothing to do with her growing steadily away from the world provided for for her. Paige's husband finds himself in both her before & after memory-loss realities. The fact that Paige & her husband find their emotional ways back to each other is a rare glimps of how proverbial chemistry plays such an influencilal role in love.

Unlike my falling in love with Rachele McAdams, which is just a fleeting feeling, as ""falling in love"" always is, this movie is a story about true love.

You accepted me for who I am, and not for what you wanted me to be.""  Then he says, ""I just wanted you to be happy.""  That is true love, a love you can't fall into.

Disbite channing tatum being very believeable as a husband who losses his wife to amnesia who then makes her fall for him again just seams like another run of the mill love story.was  I don't think the female lead Rachel mcadams did a convincing job as well as she could have done. Therefore three stars seams suffice. Thank you still a good moviebut not great.,1360800000,,387,4.608695652173913

ALSO, THE ENDING DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE ENDING.  I KEPT WAITING FOR SOMETHING GREAT TO HAPPEN AND IT DIDN'T! I GUESS IF YOU'RE REALLY INTO ROMANTIC MOVIES THIS MAYBE ALITTLE BETTER FOR YOU, BUT IT JUST DIDN'T CUT IT FOR ME.  ONLY ONES (THAT DON'T HAVE COMEDY MIXED IN) WORTH WATCHING MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE TO ME ARE THE NOTEBOOK AND TITANIC AND THIS ONE REALLY REALLY DOESN'T COMPARE.

When she revives after an induced coma, she does not remember anything that has happened over the past five years. She recovers physically, and returns home with Leo...but he is a stranger, as are all their friends. The story is about the efforts by Leo to help his beloved wife, Paige, recover her memory of their life together.  Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum at their best.",1359331200,,622,4.706422018348624

I think they could have delved even more deeply into the story of this couple, but it is a movie and unfortunately there are time constraints and you can't always get everything you want!!

4740615,4,B005LAIGSM,"I'll be the first to admit that ""The Vow"" is not a prime example of cinematic genius or anything, but I think most viewers who choose to watch it will get out of it what they want- an inspiring love story with two good-looking actors and some very romantic and sad scenes.

The story follows Leo (played by Channing Tatum) who has a whirlwind romance with Paige (Rachel McAdams). In a freak winter accident, Paige flies through the windshield of a car and wakes from a coma with the past five years of her life completely forgotten due to amnesia. She has no idea how her life has changed so dramatically from the time that she remembers, and she has no recollection of her love for Leo. Though discouraged by Paige's family and friends, Leo is determined to remind his wife how and why she fell in love with him.

4740620,1,B005LAIGSM,"This movie is based on a facinating real life true story but something in it didn't jibe. The hole in it was not memory loss, but the non-appearance of God. This God did not need to be Catholic, and i can understand why, politically, it did not need to be a right-wing born-again Bible-thumping God....but no God, not even Hollywood's wishy-washy Higher Power (without those disconcerting issuesm of Sin, Suffering, Salvation)
Paige tells Leo she loves him after he has enthusiastically expounded his support of small businesses in a Greek Restaurant.  Couldn't they have touched on the Higher Power walking along Lake Michigan.  Did it have to be so....sanitized?
What held this couple together?
How could they morph from ""He/She makes me laugh"" to Leo standing by their relationship because there was more to their relationship.  The marriage vows are mainstream culture, aren't they?  Couldn't we have had them in some generic church with reference to Hollywood's own Higher Power God.  What kind of a vow was it if Paige was giggling and friends were taking a video that was Facebook level?  What kind of a vow was it if they were a group of naughty children in an art gallery the guards chased out?  Marriage then becomes something furtive, secretive, illlicit.  On what basis did Leo love Paige?
Paige was either a compliant rich Daddy's girl, following her father's wish to study law, or some giggly free spirit with a goofy grin on her face.  Where did she get the surprising moral fiber to be shocked by her father's affair, nay, even to make the startling decision to leave her family because of it?

4740621,3,B005LAIGSM,"I'm torn here.  The movie itself is a boatload of clich&eacute;s and corny moments that add up to one gigantic `gush' of romantic goo, but there is something genuine and likable about the film regardless of its apparent obviousness.  From the very first frame, McAdams and Tatum go WAY out of their way to create this depiction of puppy love at its most puppy like.  They make goo-goo eyes at one another and cuddle and act all cute and love-like and it made me want to roll my eyes because, well, it's just not realistic.  You let it go for a scene or two and then Tatum starts writing messages with food and you realize that this film is just NOT going to give it a rest.

And then, it kind of does.

The film is `inspired' by a true story, and I'd love to know how much of it is true since it really does turn into `The Notebook' after a while and I'm wondering how many liberties were taken in order to recreate McAdams most famed role.

Leo and Paige are deep in love, married and carefree, when they are in a car accident and Paige suffers from brain trauma and wakes up not remembering her life past Law School.  Sadly, she didn't meet Leo until long after Law School, and so she's back in college (in her head), in love with another man and deeply attached to her parents, whom she actually hasn't spoken to in five years but cannot remember why she ever stopped.  Her parents swoop in and try to convince her to leave her husband and come live with them.  Leo is adamant that she resume her life with him, but her life is such a contrast to everything that she remembers that it makes things extremely difficult for the both of them, and her parent's looming influence is weighing heavily on Paige's eventual decisions.

So, like I said, this opens with a rushing gush of laughably corny romantic notions, but once Paige leaves the hospital there is a break from the overly pushy lovey-dovey stuff and we get into the heart of this story; the real love.  We see Leo fighting to remind his wife of why she loved him in the first place and we see him struggle to break free of the opinions of many around him who seem to feel that Paige will never remember him.  Tatum is a force here, and really understands the depths of `love' his character is feeling, not to mention the frustrations and despair he feels.  The visual ideas that cover some of the scenes are a bit much (director Sucsy's decisions can make the film overly sappy in many moments) but Tatum sells everything with a realism that betrays the film's overall flow.  McAdams is less effective, and she stumbles in places, but she turns in a nice performance.

I have issue with some of the plot points.  Paige's parents and their depiction is rather evil and I just can't fathom a family actually treating their daughter's marriage and the son-in-law they don't even know with such contempt.  They are childish and selfish and heartless and when you eventually find out why Paige stopped talking to them it winds up being a far less offence than the one they are currently guilty of.  Couple that with the overt corniness of the film's core romantic moments and you have a film that leaves me seriously divided.

4740665,4,B005LAIGSM,"The Vow is a romance based on real events, in which a married couple are in an accident and the wife loses five years of her memory and doesn't remember meeting, dating, or marrying her husband.  Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams deliver the goods, I don't care what anyone says.  Their characters (Leo and Paige) are utterly believable throughout the movie, and Scott Speedman as Jeremy the ex-fiancee, Jessica Lange as Paige's mother, and Sam Neill as Paige's father definitely add to the story with their convicing characters.  I've seen all the tepid reviews and I'm not sure I get what the problem is.  This is a wonderful story of a man holding true to his vow of life long love, who is also mature enough to sacrifice for the happiness of the woman he loves.  It is also a story of hope, patience, and incredible love.  My only wish is that the ending had given us a bit more, because you are really rooting for Leo, hoping Paige will either remember or will just fall in love with him again, and it would have been great to have a little more to hang your heart on than the last scene (I will not give it away more than that).  I thought Leo's voiceover throughout added to the story, made it more personal and heartwarming, and I thought the frustration, anger, pain, sadness, love, and bittersweet moments were a wonderful emotional landscape to explore.  Don't let the naysayers dissuade you--unless you are really cynical, sarcastic and jaded, or you just don't like romance, I think you'll really enjoy this movie.",1344556800,2,1527,4.62962962962963

4740717,3,B005LAIGSM,"Rachel McAdams is saddled with the toughest job in this movie, playing an amnesiac, and has difficulty pulling it off consistently. Channing Tatum's character is always actively attacking the problem so he has a range of emotion and plot points to navigate. McAdams has to be completely reactive for most of the film and spends all her time in confusion, frustration, discomfort, trepidation, and aggravation - none of which makes her character particularly engaging or appealing and all of which look pretty much the same on the screen.

Yes, it makes her real. You squirm and fidget and get frustrated yourself while watching her - just like Tatum's character does - and that's exactly the effect the film wants to achieve. It deserves applause for achieving it in large part. But that realistic touch is a hard sell in a film marketed as romantic fluff. Right or wrong, it's not what most audiences want to feel while watching it.

It's funny reading reviews here by people who complain how selfish she is because she is frequently upset and isn't cheerfully embracing all the wonderful things her husband is trying to do for her. Um, HE'S A COMPLETE STRANGER TO HER. I think they figure, ""But it's Channing Tatum!"" Okay.

4740813,3,B005LAIGSM,"UPDATE:

I had to downgrade the rating for this product.

For gaming...I'll give it 5 stars. But for pixel display...I'll give 1 star. Videos are very grainy and my art program does not work as well as with other moniters (even old ones). Thus the reason I gave it 3 stars. If you're buying a moniter for gaming only, then this is your moniter. But for regular use....I'd look else where.

END of update.

Just received my benq 2420t. It took awaile to figure how to create a custom display setup. I found a very helpful tutorial on youtube. Type in ""Benq xl2420t color"" in Youtube search and click on the first video (after the ads) and there you will find a good tutorial if you haven't figured it out yet.

Also, I had to go into my nvidia control panel to make a few adjustments also....one being the refresh rate (in the resolution section) to change it from 60 Hz to 120 Hz.  I've been viewing videos and so far...I'm very pleased. I haven't tried any games yet...the Sims 3 being my favorite. But I suspect it will be a good experience with the extra refresh rate with 120 Hz, not to mention the beautiful rich color (although I would have to give some of the credit for the rich color to the Nvidia gtx 590 video card).

I Have to say....I LOVE the color and the clear font. The yellow is the first color I look at when buying any monitor or tv. The yellow is a deep rich golden yellow - just the way it should be. Usually, in my experience, when the yellow is rich, as it should be...the rest of the colors are rich also. I had a 27 in Dell UltraSharp U2711. The reason I replaced it, was that it was too big - especially for gaming. Also, I could never get the font to look right on the web pages or when using Notepad. And the Sims 3 game would sometimes drag (if that's the right term).

With the Benq monitor, the videos play more smoothly. There's no lag when viewing videos that have a high HD setting.

Another thing I noticed, which is very important....my video card is running at a cooler temperature. With the Dell...it ran at a constant 70c sometimes going as high as 80c. But with the Benq - it's running at a constant between 50 and 60c.

So far....I am very very very pleased with this monitor. For me, it is well worth the price. I give it 5 stars.

And Bravo to Amazon.com - for the excellent service. I received my monitor one day early. I love the convenience of using Amazon.com. I've never been disapointed with their service or with the prices they offer.",1341878400,,2486,4.2905982905982905

4740815,2,B005LAIGSM,"While this film is based on true events, I'm guessing Hollywood did a great deal of embellishment to sell this one to the date night crowd.  Certainly the leads are attractive enough.  Paige (Rachel Mc Adams) and Leo (Channing Tatum) are the perfect young couple.  She's a budding artist with a very cool studio any artist would die for.  He's a self-employed recording engineer who never goes to work.

Together they live in an eclectic apartment in a groovy Chicago neighborhood.  The one where The ""L"" glows in a beautiful light blue and quietly passes overhead.  It's winter in Chicago.  The one where the billowy white snow beautifully drifts down, lightly covering the ground.  The one where it's cold, but with no wind, so heavy coats and hats aren't needed.  Well, except for one ugly hat Leo wears to enhance his cool factor.  Paige and Leo are so in love that early in the movie they have to stop at a slick intersection, unbuckle and make out.

Little did they suspect the city would have a snow plow out trying to keep the streets clear.  Little did they suspect the driver of said snow plow would be unable to stop before ""plowing"" into the rear of their Volvo.  With Paige's head now through the windshield, she is taken to the hospital and put into an induced coma.  Once she is allowed to wake up, she forgets everything from the point of her decision to leave law school and become a sculpturess.  She doesn't remember Leo or her new friends.  Leo frets and fawns over Paige but nothing is helping.

She eventually goes back to her parent's (Sam Neill and Jessica Lange) mansion in a wooded suburban section of Chicagoland.  She runs into her old boyfriend (Scott Speedman) and almost goes back to law school.  Almost that is until she stumbles upon why she uprooted her life the first time.  The actors do what they can with this simpleton script.  In one scene, Paige rolls up the car windows just so she can enjoy one of Leo's farts.  Puleeze!  I'm not against romantic films or romantic comedies.  In fact, I like them.  At least those that don't overdose me with saccharine.

The Blu ray disc looks and sounds great unlike the movie.  A 1080p & 2.40:1 aspect ratio transfer.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  The video and audio are both very good and keep you into the film.  Hey, maybe that was the problem.",1341619200,3,2337,4.559036144578314

4740822,2,B005LAIGSM,"If this movie was made in the 1950's and trust me, many of the character sensibilities and melodramatic plot turns feel of that period, then this old-fashioned 2012 romantic drama would be marketed as a ""date movie"", one you would have seen in a drive-in as you try to figure out if you're going to make it to third base with your date. It would have starred Troy Donahue and either Connie Stevens or Suzanne Pleshette with plenty of picture-postcard scenes as they decide should they or shouldn't they.  Granted, this film goes well past that question but still ponders the enduring power of love against the odds of amnesia, overbearing parents, a snarky ex-boyfriend, and a bohemian lifestyle that still seems quite comfortable. Credited to no less than three writers - Abby Kohn, Marc Silverstein, and Jason Katims - and directed by Michael Sucsy, the story is based on the true experiences of a devoutly Christian couple who amazingly went through the trials depicted here, and even though the religious element could have brought an intriguing angle to a more audacious filmmaker, it's removed in this version to broaden its audience appeal. It also makes the whole venture feel more manufactured and ultimately generic.

Paige and Leo are an attractive pair of kindred artistic soulmates who fall desperately in love. Everything is beyond euphoric for them until a snowstorm forces a truck to skid uncontrollably and sends Paige headlong through their front windshield right after she unbuckles her seatbelt to smooch Leo. Paige later awakens from a coma to see Leo at her bedside and thinks he's her doctor. It turns out the collision has erased the last five years of her memory. She doesn't remember not only meeting and marrying Leo but also leaving law school to become an avant-garde sculptor and vegetarian. We find out she has completely forgotten her estrangement from her status-conscious parents who want to see her reunite with Jeremy, the businessman fiance she had dumped before even meeting Leo, a struggling music producer. Consequently, she starts to revert back to her earlier self, and it is apparently up to Leo to reignite the chemistry that brought them together in the first place. If the set-up wasn't based on reality, there could have been the makings of an interesting psychological thriller or even a dark comedy, but the whole story is played straight-up for maximum tissue usage.

Although I am beginning to appreciate his comic skills elsewhere (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/21-Jump-Street/dp/B0081L37Z0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">21 Jump Street</a>), the lunkish Channing Tatum has to work overtime to come across as anything more than this generation's Troy Donahue as the tortured Leo, but the by-the-numbers script, especially his psycho-babble voiceover, works heavily against him.

Her Paige whether in before or after modes is no exception to this increasingly tired pattern. The normally likeable Scott Speedman is relegated to the cardboard role of resentful suitor as Jeremy, while Sam Neill is all greed and bluster as Paige's father.

I have truly enjoyed her performances in many films and noticed that she has an uncanny ability to allow her authenticity to bleed into a scene.  She actually made the plot of Wedding Crashers feasible and realistic, despite the rampant abuse of shock comedy.  When I saw the previews, I just knew that she was going to bring something palpable through the screen.  I was a bit confused as to the selection of Mr. Tatum as her leading actor, but I just ~knew~ that if she signed onto this project, it was going to be well worth it.  Unfortunately, there was not a healthy balance throughout the movie.  There was no real angst, confusion, or despair that seemed to emanate from Mr. Tatum.  It felt as if McAdams was performing opposite a really bad intern.  Furthermore, there seemed to be little support offered from the people represented in his side of the partnership.  I was not looking for a sequel to ""The Notebook"", but I was not looking for the prequel to ""Magic Mike"" either.

4741017,3,B005LAIGSM,"THE VOW claims to be ""inspired by true events"" which usually means the basic premise is based on fact and the rest if all fiction. It is an interesting concept. A desperately in love couple is split apart after a tragic accident erases the past 5 years of the memory of the wife. Her husband is now a complete stranger. Her feelings are now with the ex-finance she dumped years ago. Time has stood still and everything that has happened in the past 5 years is no longer part of her memory or reality. Her family is back in her life as there is no memory of the rift that caused her to break all contact with them.

THE VOW certainly has good intentions even though something is lost along the way. Rachel McAdams as Paige is lovely as always and Channing Tatum provides the beefcake. They both try but the chemistry between them is not so strong. It is interesting to follow Paige's journey into a life she does not remember and her looking at pictures and videos that must seem totally alien. The story could have delved deeper into this journey.

Sam Neill and Jessica Lange are in the supporting roles of Paige's parents. It was sad to see how time has not been good to the lovely Jessica Lange who looks so much older than her ""husband"" Sam Neill. Paige returns to her parents' home since there is no memory of why she left and broke all contact with them and including her sister. She even broke contact with her sister apparently for no reason. When we learn the reason for the rift, it is anti-climatic. Is that all? That is the reason she left her family and broke all contact? It seems like the author could have found a more compelling reason.

At the end there is a brief reference to the couple who inspired this story. I was hoping there would be a bonus feature in the extras to tell more about this couple.

THE VOW is an OK movie. I was hoping for much more but it wasn't a total disappointment. A good film if you need a bit of light entertainment.",1338422400,4,1965,4.331521739130435

Most of the major events, including the ending (which I won't give away) are accurate.  The real story that the movie is based upon is already touching and captivating, making it very easy for the writers.  But the creativity stopped there.  Many of the elements in the movie feel tacked on in an effort to give the plot more conflict.  Sam Neill and Jessica Lange give great performances, but unfortunately, their characters aren't believable and seem more like the stereotypical movie villans.

The acting by Channing Tatum is just plain disappointing.  I'm not sure what the thinking was behind putting a ""buff guy"" in a tender character, but they still could have found a man with muscles AND acting ability.  Rachel McAdams gives a good performance, but it takes more than one good actor to make a good movie.

And finally, to leave a bitter feeling in the viewers mouth, the movie seems to end way to early in the story, and you're left wondering ""That's it?""  True, we do want some questions left unanswered, but we still need some sense of closure.

In a nutshell, the main reason why ""The Vow"" is a subpar romantic movie is simpler than just ""the acting was bad"" or ""the dialogue was poorly written"".

4741112,2,B005LAIGSM,"In The Notebook, an old couple are struggling with her dementia which has erased her memory of their passionate love story. Her devoted husband attempts to rekindle the spark with a diary she wrote describing their young love.  In flashbacks, we see Rachel McAdams playing the older woman as a young, fiery girl who is an artist, and  defies her rich, brittle mother's desires for her to attend college and marry into wealth and prestige.  Instead, she gives herself to a local poor boy, Ryan Gosling,  until they are separated by distance and parental conniving. She forgets her heart's wishes and  decides her parents' plans for her are best after all, including an engagement to a rich suitor and abandoning her art . Her lover, Ryan, meanwhile, never forgets , and plots and plans how he will be able to re-ignite their love one day by renovating a derelict house into a fabulous showplace as a monument to the lovemaking they performed there.  Gosling's smoldering passion is palpable and when you compare him to Channing Tatum's similar role in The Vow, Channing comes off looking like an amateur.  He is all hunk and no acting ability.  In The Vow, Rachel McAdams recycles her role from The Notebook, as a defiant daughter with lying, brittle parents who reclaim her from her husband after a brain injury erases her memory of their love, her art, and her parents conniving. Blah, blah, blah.
In The Vow, however, she loses her memory while still young and tries to remember how she got married to Channing by reading her wedding vows, written on a napkin.  An old boyfriend actually looks better to her. Also, she is not quite sure what to do with that discarded pile of clay she was once molding into something meaningful when she gave up law school to to find herself as an artist.
The Vow is like that discarded clay.  Everyone forgot what to do with it. The Vow's premise had promise but the execution is so flat.  Bad dialogue.  Wooden acting by Channing Tatum, bare bum and all.  Rachel McAdams who was luminous in The Notebook, faked every emotion in The Vow and just came off shrill.

I do have to address one thing.  People ranking this movie down because the director taking liberties with the story, specifically with the ""took the christian"" out of the movie.  Well, that's not all they did and changed.  The characters are hotter, ""hottness"" is like art, and Adams is fine.  While not a huge fan of Tatum movies, I thought he did really well in this.

4741182,4,B005LAIGSM,"Paige Thornton (Rachel McAdams) and Leo (Channing Tatum) are madly in love.  They meet by accident in a city office building and the chemistry is immediate.  They are made for each other and soon after they get married.  The romance continues until a tragic auto accident.

Their parked car is slammed into from behind by a massive truck that injures both of them but she is thrown through the windshield and endures massive brain trauma. She is kept in a coma to help her recover from brain swelling and injuries.  Leo lovingly stays by her side throughout the ordeal.  When she is finally awoken she remembers everything about her life from 5 years ago but nothing about her career, her art schooling or her love and marriage to Leo....

This is a classic love story that is tragically broken while at its peak by the accident.  Leo fights to regain Paige's love and to keep her meddling parents from taking over her second chance at life.  Paige forgets why she left her parents' home, left law school and she still loves her old boyfriend but doesn't know her loving husband and all the friends of the last 5 years.

This is a well written story line based on true events.  It is sad, sweet and brings back the meaning of your wedding vows that you committed for life.  It will make you smile and it will make you sad.  I like the fact that the two main protagonists seem to have real chemistry together and for me it made the movie.

The movie received poor reviews from the critics but it did well at the box office and it is well worth seeing.  My wife and I enjoyed the movie and I believe you will too!",1337385600,,1611,4.39527027027027

4741185,5,B005LAIGSM,"After watching the coming attractions, I was anxious to purchase the DVD. To my surprise, I was quite pleased with every aspect of what a good movie should be and this one was well-worth the purchase. Based on a true story, the lead characters, Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum fit the roles to perfection. The viewer could understand the trauma of the impact of an accident as described and in many ways can relate to such horror if it happened to you, a friend, or a loved one. At times, I felt deep sorrow for what Rachel had to go through, and very sorry for what Channing had to do to show his compassion. This movie is one incredible romance with no flaws from beginning to end, and there are hundreds of romance movies out there that simply cannot compete. There are moments you will laugh, moments you will cry, and moments of deep emotion you cannot forget. The acting is superb, the plot is excellent, and it tugs at the heartstrings! Most important, the definition of True Love shines throughout. Highly recommended for all romance lovers, and for all those seeking a movie with inspiration in a good love story.",1336953600,,1124,4.597014925373134
4741186,1,B005LAIGSM,"To the script writers of the movie ""The Vow"":

Way to take an epic, real-life story of heroic Christ-like love and strip the heart and soul out of it.

I know you Hollywood types are chronically incapable of comprehending anything remotely resembling true, unconditional commitment that never gives up for any reason, but just because you can't understand it doesn't give you license to pull it down to your level. This movie proves that Hollywood really can't tell true love when it's staring them right in the face in the form of the real-life couple that this movie is (barely) based on.

In summary: Deeply disappointed.

If you want to know the REAL story, Amazon.com sells the book authored by the real couple that actually went through these events AND chose to stay true to their vows, regardless of how difficult it was.  Kim and Krickitt Carpenter had a very rough beginning to their marriage, but Kim (the husband) never divorced Krickitt, there was no pressure from her father to do so, and there was no schism between her and her family.  This movie takes the real-life drama of a painful and difficult situation and replaces it with artificial made-for-Hollywood drama that was far less interesting.  And worst of all, they stripped out the very faith in God that is the core of their love for one another and which made it possible for them to work through their tragedy.

4741247,5,B005LAIGSM,"There are sappy romance films galore being released to theaters these days that have the most unbelievable stories behind them. So the biggest surprise this week is a romance that is unbelievable and yet based on reality. Not only that but the movie is touching, romantic and draws you in. That movie is THE VOW.

Channing Tatum and Rachael McAdams play Leo and Paige, a young couple deeply in love on their way home from a night out in winter. Stopped at a stop sign, their car is rear ended by a sliding snow plow, sending Paige through the window to suffer severe brain damage. Kept in a coma to decrease the severity of her injury when she wakes she has no recollection of the accident but worse still no idea who Leo is. It's as if the last 5 years of her life have disappeared.

Hoping that time heals all wounds, Leo stays with her even though she recoils from him, a complete stranger in her mind. Her parents (Sam Neill and Jessica Lange) show and try to encourage her to leave the hospital and go with them. Leo convinces her that the best hope she has of recovering her memory is to return to the life they had. She agrees for now with the idea that should things not work out she'll return to her parent's home.

Its slow going as the couple Leo tries to convince the woman he desperately loves that she loves him in return. The Paige from before she and Leo met is a completely different person from who he thought he knew. For some reason she left her home and friends to come to the city, but we never know why. The couple goes back and forth, trying to bring back their life together but eventually Paige's parents convince her to come home.

Helping her sister plan her wedding and still trying to find herself, Paige meets up with her ex-fianc (Scott Speedman). Her parents try to convince her that she still wants to go to law school even though she was an artist while with Leo. An old friend is shunned but others are brought back into the fold. And as Leo watches, hoping against all odds to reunite with this woman, she slowly begins to distance herself from him for her old self.

This romance involves not two young lovers meeting for the first time but two lovers who met and fell in love only to lose all memory of that. The only hope is for them to once more come together replacing those old memories with new ones. And the suspense of the film lies in that idea, of whether or not they can come together once more of will Paige slide back into the past that is all she remembers now. And what about that terrible secret that no one seems to want to talk about that forced her out so long ago?

The movie is supposed to be based on an actual couple that went through this trauma and after watching the film many will want to make a point of reading the book based on their life to find out just what is and isn't a part of their story. In the meantime this movie offers a completely entertaining night that won't bore you and actually won't make you break down and cry either, no matter how it sounds. This is a movie where you won't find yourself checking the clock to see just how much is left. It moves along at a steady pace and draws you into the story in steps.

The acting is amazing. Never once did I find myself wondering if I was watching actors or real people and that says something. The gift of a true actor is to make you believe they are the people they are portraying. McAdams and Tatum both do that to great effect here.  With the roles he chose early on many would have thought Tatum was nothing more than a muscle bound action star but he displays a depth of emotion here that is necessary for this story to be taken seriously. McAdams shows the frustration and fear in the character of Paige that makes her part of the story come alive as well.

Toss aside trying to place this film in the category of chick flick. It's a truly entertaining film from start to finish that will leave you waiting to find out if they get back together or not. This is a movie not only worth renting but worth adding to your collection as well.",1336953600,,4073,4.272373540856031

I thought this movie was really awesome. Even my husband, who I thought would totally think it's a chic flick and not really be interested in, watched the entire movie and actually said he thought it was really good and it should have gotten more than 3 1/2 stars. The movie is based on a true story about a married couple who get in a car accident and the wife loses her memory. It practically starts off with the accident but then shows some flashbacks of them together and how totally in love they were. Channing Tatum played an adoring husband who is so in love with his wife and is willing to do anything to get her memory back. I thought Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams made a cute couple and just watching how cute they were together just made me think of how much I love and appreciate all my husband does for me and just makes you think of how sometimes you just take things and time for granted. That may sound sappy but that is how it made me feel and it is a film that I would definitely watch again.

On the plus side ""The vow"" had likable characters, a solid plot, and AMAZING chemistry between Tatum and McAdam's. Aside from those positive points I was still disappointed.

The first half of the movie pulled me. I laughed, I cried, I enjoyed the romance between them. A big plus were the flashbacks, I felt that it showed the TRUE love between the couple.

The second half is where the disappointment started. For a long period of time the movie was basically at a stand-still, you didn't know what was going to happen to the couple. Would they stay together, split up, would she ever remember? Then, after all the back and forward between them, the movie just comes to an end. It happens unexpectedly, and basically leaves a lot of unanswered questions.

Basically this movie had the makings of an everlasting love story, but fell short somewhere during the second half. Although, it wasn't one of my favorites, everyone should be the judge for themselves.",1336694400,4,1163,4.747524752475248

He was truly the perfect gentleman. He even learned to love the cat. Great for a superficial story but not a great movie. I would have liked him to have had more voice to express anger even at her for lets face it ruining his life and not trusting him.

4741377,4,B005LAIGSM,"Romance movies (often times referred to as Chick Flicks) have a tendency to be fodder for Kleenex advertisements: too often these movies are judged by how many times the lacrimal ducts give a stimulus response instead of the nature of the film itself.  THE VOW for all intents and purposes seems and sound and looks like a Nicholas Sparks recipe film, but the fact that is NOT by Sparks should alert the audience that there may be more here than expected.  Based on a true story, rendered by Stuart Sender and Jason Katims and adapted for the screen by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein, knowing that the concept is based on reality helps ground the film. Director Michael Sucsy (Grey Gardens) manages to keep this overly long film centered and allows each of the characters to become developed as people rather than clones.

Leo Channing Tatum in his most sensitive role to date) and Paige (Rachel McAdams) are a couple who just got married. After an accident, Paige is left unconscious, and when she awakes she doesn't remember Leo. Her physician (Wendy Crewson) reassures her that her memory will likely return if she resumes a normal life. Her parents (Sam Neill and Jessica Lange), whom she hasn't since she and Leo got together, come and visit her - a rather strange situation since Paige has not had contact with her parents since she left law school (we later find out why the personal motivations) and moved to the city (Chicago) to pursue a career as a sculptor. For some reason Paige remembers her parents and her old friends (including a sister (Jessica McNamee)  with whom she broke ties five years ago, ditto an ex-boyfriend (Scott Speedman, remembered for his brilliant performance in 'The 24th Day') she abandoned. Leo and Paige's new family (Joey Klein, Joe Cobden and Shannon Barnett) want to bring her home with them but her parents demand she return to their expensive home to prepare for Paige's sisters wedding to a nice guy (Dillon Casey). She goes with Leo but when she doesn't recognize anything, she goes to her parents. When Paige returns to her parents she is puzzled as to why she left five years ago. Meanwhile Leo tries to win her back by courting her again. Secrets are uncovered and though Paige never regains her memory, her life does indeed change.

Though the film does indeed drag a bit at times and could have used a better editor, the actors bring this unusual story to life.  No, it is not a great movie, but it is a solid one.  Grady Harp, May 12",1336608000,2,2484,4.657534246575342

The story line is pretty good. Leo and Pagie gets into a car accident and Leo is fine, but Pagie has lost her memory. But, she only lost her memory up till a certain point in her life. She doesn't remember Leo, who is her husband. What she does remember is that she just about to go to Law School and she was with her old BF at the time. Pagie gives a shot to live with Leo and not with her parents, which she original wanted to do. But, after Leo convinced her and her parents that it's the better choice to come live with him because she could get her memory back that way. So, Pagie goes lives with Leo. Leo shows Pagie how she was when he was with her and that doesn't go too well. She ends up acting like her old pass self, which Leo has never met. To Leo, this is like a whole different person.

Now Leo wants to give this old Pagie a shot. He believes that if he could make the old Pagie fall in love with him, maybe the Pagie he knew will come back out. This doesn't go exactly how he wanted and they end divorced afterwards. They both then try to live their own lives without each other.

Eventually, Pagie starts to realized how come she changed so much from the old Pagie that Leo knew. She realized that she hated her parants and that she hated her old BF too. Pagie decides to leave her old life behind and build yet another new life. Leo doesn't knows this and continue on living without her and doing his own thing.

This is the kicker. Now, somehow, since this is a love story movie, these two meet each other at the end of the movie again. They decided to give it another shot. Pagie never got her memory back, but still gives hope that it will all work out at the end.

I believe this movie had all the right pieces to be a great movie, it just wasn't executed well enough to make me want to give it a higher rating. I didn't believe those two were in love on in their love scenes. These two didn't take me away and want to care for them. I wasn't happy or sad when they were together or when they left.

The movie is basically centered around Paige and Leo, a young couple that seemed to fall in love almost immediately and got married shortly after. The couple is involved in a car accident, with Paige, of course, not wearing a seat belt and being ejected out of her seat and through the windshield. The movie tells the story of how the couple met and fell in love, Paige losing her memories of her husband, and how Leo struggles with the fact that the love of his life no longer remembers him and really doesn't seem to really want anything to do with him.

I thought the movie was just OK. To me, this movie kind of fell short like the movie ""Dear John"". Who knows, maybe had they picked a different actor for Leo instead of Channing Tatum, I might of liked it a little better, but with the way it was and Channing taking over the role of Leo, it kind of fell flat. It's not something that I personally will be buying on DVD, but if it was to ever come out on Netflix, I might watch it again.

And for the film's starry-eyed target audience, no amount of dis will sway them. Still, somewhere, even the staff writers at Hallmark are rolling their eyes.

In wintry Chicago, Leo (Tatum) and Paige (Rachel McAdams) are a young married couple still very much in love with each other. After all, they wrote their wedding vows on the menus of their favorite restaurant, and that right there probably qualifies what they have as some sort of legendary love affair. But then a runaway truck smashes into their car, and there's Paige catapulting thru the windshield. Leo, who had his seatbelt on, is relatively fine. When Paige awakens from her coma, she discovers that she's suffering from selective amnesia. She can't remember the last five years of her life. She can't imagine being this in demand sculptor and living in the city and married to Leo, this sudden stranger.

I'm sure them womenfolk are swooning all over Channing Tatum (who also bares his behind in one scene, so, uh, yay). Tatum is rendered ridiculously sympathetic by his romantic gestures and by virtue of what he's put thru by the amnesiac Paige. Leo remains the sweet devoted spouse, desperately striving to win his estranged wife all over again. But it's tough, really tough. Once a free-spirited creature, Paige now seems like an entirely different person. One of Leo and Paige's mutual friends voices our concern: ""I'm just worried if she doesn't remember you, how's she supposed to remember she's in love with you?"" Somewhere, Nicholas Sparks is kicking himself for not thinking up this plot.

Not that Paige is purposely mean or thoughtless. She's experiencing her own bits of turmoil. And, me, what I found really interesting are those moments which focus on Paige and the scary stuff she's going thru. Rachel McAdams is quite good at conveying that sense of desolation and confusion and helplessness one must feel when stricken with deep memory loss.

From Paige's perspective, it's like this: She's never had a falling out with her rich, conservative parents (Sam Neill and Jessica Lange). She's still in law school and engaged to her old sweetheart Jeremy (Scott Speedman). Today, Paige can't comprehend what would compel her to move to the city or give up law study or not be on speaking terms with her parents. What made her break up with Jeremy? I remember getting mad at myself in the theater for getting suckered in by these concerns. But I found myself wanting to know what made Paige turn her back on her old life five years ago.

Watching the love of your life just slip away from you, no matter how hard you try to hold on - what's a more irresistible premise, especially on Valentine's Day? Channing Tatum's got a long road to go before he achieves real actor status. He still tends to be stiff and awkward. Except that, for this film, his awkwardness works in his favor. It makes him even more of an underdog, especially when pitted against the urbane Speedman and those old acting hands Sam Neill and Jesicca Lange. It's a shame, by the way, that Jessica Lange only gets that one scene in which to strut her stuff.

There are romantic beats in THE VOW that, for all their predictability and heavyhandedness, are still worth waiting for. And that's because McAdams and Tatum do create some sparks in their scenes together. Despite her newfound attraction to Jeremy, Paige gradually, cautiously becomes open to Leo's advances. She remarks: ""I married him. It must've been for some reason."" This then leads to probably my favorite sequence, which is their ""first date."" Since I'm a manly man, I won't swoon or have vapors. But I liked that sequence.

THE VOW is based on the real-life story of Kim and Krickitt Carpenter. Apparently, Krickitt never did recover from her amnesia, and yet they're happily married with two kids. Not that I'm saying that's what happens in this movie. In fact, surprisingly, THE VOW veers away from giving us a grand romantic gesture in the finale. I like that the resolution unfolds unexpectedly and messily and almost in anticlimactic fashion. But the way the last 20 or so minutes unfold feels more believable. I was glad there wasn't a mad dash thru the airport or a dramatic ""Stop the Wedding!"" moment at the twelfth hour. The clich&eacute; police are overtaxed as it is.",1330041600,56,4771,4.803897685749086
4741483,4,B005LAIGSM,"Chick Flick Alert! We love 'em and aren't afraid to admit it. Happily, this sudsy PG-13 romance is based on a true story and we see a photo of the real people involved during the closing credits.

What does a devoted husband do when the lovely young woman he courted, loved and married, is injured in a devastating accident? When she comes out of her medically induced coma, she has no idea who he is; she only remembers her OLD boyfriend and events from five years and earlier!

Here are the principal players:
  * Tatum Channing (""Haywire"") is Leo, a self-employed businessman who drops everything in an attempt to help his wife regain her memory. BTW, this actor does some of his best work with his shirt (and everything else) off. ...smile...
  * Rachel McAdams (""Sherlock Holmes"") is Paige, daughter of a prominent judge. She hasn't been in touch with her family for five years but can't remember why. Nor can she remember why she dropped out of law school, or anything about a marriage to this nice stranger.
  * Jessica Lange (""American Horror Story"") is Rita Thornton, our heroine's mother, who dashes to her daughter's hospital bedside, eager to bring her back to the bosom of the family.
  * Sam Neill (""The Hunter"") is Bill Thornton, the judge who pulls strings to get his girl back into law school. He is somehow involved in the underlying reason why she can't recapture those past five years.
  * Scott Speedman (""The Moth Diaries"") is Jeremy, the old beau. He is delighted to realize that his is the only relationship she remembers and he is yearning to start all over.

So now we watch family dynamics, with the parents happy to leave her past forgotten, our forlorn husband trying to woo back his wife, her confusion when confronted with her recent art work, and her reaction when she goes back to law school.

Only one person will sacrifice his own happiness to see HER happy. Who, you might ask? C'mon...it's a Chick Flick! I'll be happy when Amazon.com notifies me of the DVD release date.",1329782400,27,2008,4.651558073654391

4741486,4,B005LAIGSM,"Surprisingly enough, there is much to be said about ""The Vow"", the latest movie from writer Abby Kohn (Valentines Day & Never Been Kissed) and it isn't bad. Is the screenplay outstanding? No. It isn't. In fact, it's pretty typical romantic movie fair. Despite the fact that the movie starts and ends with a note that says it is based on actual events and shows a picture of the couple that inspired the movie, the movie could have very easily fallen into soap opera lala-land. It doesn't though, for many reasons.

First off, a quick explanation of the film and why it could have been, but wasn't, silly. The movie starts off with Leo, played by Channing Tatum (Dear John, Step Up) and Paige, played by Rachel McAdams (The Notebook, Morning Glory), leaving a movie theatre, smiling and enjoying a beautiful snowy night and they are obviously very much in love. Little do they know, they are about to walk into a situation that will change their lives forever. Moments later, they are both wheeled into an emergency room and Leo's injuries are far less severe than Paige's. When Paige recovers or awakes, days later, she has no memory of Leo or the fact that they are married and truly in love. This is where it could have been very soap opera, but instead, the movie is very real. We experience the dilemmas that both characters are facing and the director and writer handle it capably.

What truly makes ""The Vow"" a movie that will stand the test of time though, is the chemistry between McAdams and Tatum. The two of them are fantastic at portraying the unique bond that they have. Their relationship is truly unique and as the movie flashes back to their life and shows how they met, how they courted, how they got married and you know that they belong together. This isn't scripting. This is acting, because as the coin flips, both actors take that very same love they feel for each other and become strangers with different personalities.

I'm not sure that the movie could have been written any differently, but the story is a little bit clich' and done before, but hasn't it all by now. What truly makes ""The Vow"" a standout film is the performances by Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams. They prove that they are both stars to be recognized with in Hollywood and that they both know how to take an audience and shape them like putty in their hands. I think McAdams was always good at that and Tatum is getting better.",1329177600,,2424,4.580645161290323
