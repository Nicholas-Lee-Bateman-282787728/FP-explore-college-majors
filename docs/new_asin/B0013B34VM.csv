8249691,5,B0013B34VM,A great story and series which doesn't get enough recognition sometimes.

A great ending for a great series.,1388707200,,251,4.7272727272727275
8249692,5,B0013B34VM,"I was interested in the series which was view on TV. I enjoy collecting good anime, yet due to the economy purchasing the anime I enjoy from the retailer is not an option due to the value & price range of the items. I am gald amazon has reasonable prices & a wide range of sellers who can meet the buyers demand.  More impressed with the arrive time of the my order & how well the merchandise was package with care from the seller. Many times online purchasing can be rather hesitant but I am planning to make furture purchases with amazon & its vendors.",1360022400,,554,4.276190476190476

8249696,4,B0013B34VM,"Well ladies and gentlemen this is the final four episodes. In here you will find the conclusion to the Witchblade series. What finally happens to Masane and her daughter? Will the new leader of the NSWF kill Masane and take the Witchblade for herself? These will be some of the most emotional episodes in the series, and some of the longest fighting scenes also. If you have been watching the series from the start then this purchase is a must. If you have yet to see Witchblade, it has good action and a great story.
The destiny of the Witchblade continues...",1217289600,2,560,4.554455445544554
8249697,4,B0013B34VM,"This is a great series overall.  The way battles are balanced out against the story is very good.  There is PLENTY of fanservice if that is your thing, but it really comes earlier in the series as this disc closes the story of this Witchblade.

The changes Masane has expected with the Witchblade begin, and the last three episodes on the disc really tie together into one epic episode that views quite like a mini-movie.  The story builds in the first three episodes focusing on the relationships Masane has developed, and then in the fourth episode ""Light"" all hell breaks loose as the I-weapons, Cloneblades, and Witchblade all engage in a final showdown in the middle of Tokyo.  The end leaves plenty to the imagination, but watch beyond the credits because there is a bit more to be seen.

If you haven't purchased this series by volume, wait for the inevitable box set.  If you've been watching, enjoy the last volume.",1209168000,3,924,4.701863354037267
