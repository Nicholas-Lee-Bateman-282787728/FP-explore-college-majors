8055633,5,B00085ETP4,"This is great DVD but slightly over priced.
It is an overview of some major concepts in Indian music.
However, it doesn't really teach one how to play it on guitar.
Most of the stuff he does is too fast and advanced for us to
pick up by watching.  The section on Gamakka is only an introduction
and he does not reveal too much.  He only show 2 tricks and one of
them is just a regular pull off.  He says he will release a second DVD exclusively for Gammakas.  This is really just a showcase for his music and not too much about how to learn.  He talks about different scales but we can get that from any book.  The CD rom claims to have music sheets for everything he plays in the dVD but it is not tab.  ONly notes, you have to know how to read music.  There are some documents but that's about it.  I wish this stuff was in tab.  When he plays the Todi raga in Indian classical tuning it is rather confusing.  He claims Thodi is nothing but D phrygian but I mapped out D phrygian and even used his tuning but it seems he is using different notes or more embellisments.  Bottom line... you can't learn what he does from this DVD.  You can expand your music knowledge and maybe just maybe cop a little of what he is doing.  Most of it is way..way...way to fast to see what he is doing and he concentrates more on theory than technique.  But nevertheless it is great DVD and highly recomended! Most of it is mindboggling and makes want to throw down your guitar and stop playing!!!!",1206748800,5,1481,4.165492957746479
8055634,5,B00085ETP4,"This dvd gives a very good introduction to carnatic music raagas and talks about gamakas or the microtones. There are illustrations of the raagas like ""bilahari"", ""nalinakanthi"", ""abheri"" etc.. The dvd comes with scores for all the compositions played mostly where it is possible to express it using notation.

  The section about gamakas is really good. This could have been even more eloborate but still it does a good job. If you know  little bit of carnatic music and staff notation this dvd is for you. Other people can also buy the dvd but for novices and newbies this can't be recommended. It is impossible to compress a few hundred years of traditional carnatic music in a 90 mins dvd.",1144368000,4,693,4.75
8055635,4,B00085ETP4,"I am an avid fan of Prasanna and his Guitar. Through this instructional DVD Prasanna offers an insight into the world of Carnatic Music and how to play it on the guitar. Understanding carnatic to the musician steeped in western/classical tradition is difficult, as these grace note slurs and microtones, embellishments, improvisation based on a raga tend to confuse. But Prasanna manages to explain these nuances with ease.

This DVD is a must for anyone who wants to explore Carnatic music. As this is a barebones ""How To"" on playing carnatic on the guitar.",1140048000,3,558,4.9361702127659575
8055636,5,B00085ETP4,"I bought John McLaughlin's ""This is the Way I do it"" 3 set DVD

and this ranks right up there with it as a quantum leap for guitarists and any instrumental musician in general that wants to go outside of the box if they so desire; or, play somewhat within the boxes, with a different twist and flexibility.  If you want Indian music exposures with relationships to traditional Western hemisphere applications, then this is it!  For rockers, fusionists especially, jazzists, classisists and world music.  Guys! Do album w.violin,tablas/shock the world!",1124668800,5,551,5.088888888888889
