8246200,5,B0012J76L4,"Enjoyed this series when it was first shown on British ITV from 2002-2006; it was later shown on BBC America.  Robson Green (Touching Evil; Soldier, Soldier) convincingly plays the eccentric, Cracker-like psychologist.  He assists the police:  Hermione Norris (Spooks / MI-5) in the first three seasons and Simone Lahbib (Bad Girls).  Each disc has one episode which runs just over 1:30 hours;  three discs in the first series and four in all the others.  The stories are interesting but graphic - not for everyone;  but, they were shown on mainstream TV.  Glad I can watch these again.  See also series five and six and Prayer of the Bone.",1423094400,,640,4.851851851851852

8246204,4,B0012J76L4,"BOUGHT THIS OUT OF CURIOSITY AND FOUND THE STORYLINE DIFFERENT BUT VERY INTERESTING.
DON'T THINK IT WILL BE FOR EVERYONE AS SOME OF THE STORIES ARE A BIT MORBID OR DISTURBING.
THE MAIN CHARACTER GROWS ON YOU.",1346371200,2,208,4.648648648648648
8246205,4,B0012J76L4,"Just so others to whom this might be meaningful know: This gripping, well-acted series with intense story lines has no captioning. I watch everything with captions so I can catch occasional mumbled dialogue. I really struggle with this series on DVD, as the actors have fairly heavy accents and frequently do not articulate very clearly. I estimate that I'm missing (easily) 25 percent of what's spoken. I've no regrets about buying the set (I also bought seasons 5 and 6 and the episode that was released separately), but my viewing pleasure would be greatly enhanced if the DVDs had closed captioning. Given that the series is not that old, I was completely surprised that I couldn't access captions. Other than that (to me, significant) complaint about the set, the series is wonderful! If closed captioning was available, I would definitely give this set 5 stars.",1321574400,14,867,4.9862068965517246
8246206,4,B0012J76L4,"I often love BBC mystery/crime drama series. This is one of my favorites.  I have watched every episode in Seasons 1-3 at least 4 times in the past 2 years. I admit I am less fond of Season 4.  What I love about the series is that the scripts are intelligently written, topics of each episode are different and unusual--rarely ones I've seen on American television, very well-acted.  In Seasons 1-3, the dynamic between Tony Hill and Carol Jordan adds further continuity and interest to each episode.  Location shooting also further enhances the stories, such as the episode where Jack--a serial rapist, beater, and killer--harms the girls in a former chapel and buries their bodies either in the church cemetary or dumps them in nearby rivers.  The only reason I am not fond of Season 4 is that I didn't care for the character replacement for Carol Jordan when actress Hermione Norris left to go to Spooks (Roz Myers).  Somehow the feel of the entire show changed, even with many old regulars, and I never personally liked those episodes as much as the earlier ones.",1247270400,3,1067,4.7405405405405405
8246207,5,B0012J76L4,"Robson Green and a brilliant cast of pplayers bring process series to a new height in this classy psych series.  BLOOD IN THE WIRE eclipses the American versions of these kinds of programs.  Story lines are mature, intelligent, and explore the profoundly dark sides of human beings in a way that does not merely exploit but seeks to enlighten.  The quality of the writing and psychological insight each program brings the audience is a cause for discussion among adults, a group for which American TV rarrely writes.",1217462400,12,516,4.908045977011494
