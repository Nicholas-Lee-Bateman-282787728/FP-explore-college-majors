453420,5,6302277760,"As far as comedy films go, this is my all-time favorite.  While I think I have a pretty good sense of humor, there aren't many films that will make me laugh out loud.  This one does.  In fact, there are belly-laughs galore from start to finish.  I have recommended this film to many of my friends and everyone that has seen it has loved it.  Highly recommended.",1050796800,7,361,4.3283582089552235
453471,4,6302277760,"We love this movie.  This movie is a standard straight man vs funny man, like abbot and Costello.  Martin Short is very good as a clumsy, luckless person, where Danny Glover plays the straight man, and is just as good in the movie.  Most of us, fall within these two characters in life. So when you watch this and see yourself just give a good laugh and say that's me. It doesn't matter which type of person you are. Your still special.",1515628800,,436,4.2926829268292686

The chemistry between himself and co-star Danny Glover is palpable.  I had a vague recall of this movie while watching Siskel and Ebert and they pointed their thumbs down in unison.  Methinks the critics should let their guards down and admit they enjoy a movie instead of giving a kneejerk reaction to the films they are reviewing.  Note of trivia.

However when I got it I thought the picture on the cover of disc looked like something my husband would have made for a burned copy. Then the movie started immediately, no previews and I realized it must be copied from a vhs. I guess its legal, otherwise how could amazon sell it right? Just very strange to see it. (I have never noticed there was a DVD-R on the lists, which in fact do state they are recorded)I have just never paid any attention to that, I just thought it was illegal period so wouldnt expect it. The copy itself is pretty good, definitely not an great one but I don't think its worthy of the price. For a copy like that, I wish it had been 10 bucks or less. So if it ever goes on sale its a great buy, for now.....I'd wait.

There are a couple of swear words, but not nearly as bad as today's movies.  There are so many one-liners in this movie that we'll often throw one out here and there, and everyone gets a good chuckle.

I remember the clips from the talk shows when Martin Short was promoting it,maybe TV spots. It was the airplane scene flying over a jungle with a bee on-board,well even knowing what was coming I would laugh every time. Of course I'm all for comedy and if it's really great it's worth watching again,and again.
I just watched the French version of this,""Le Chevre"" and it was made ten years earlier than ""Pure Luck"".""Pure Luck"" follows the former film almost line for line,but with more energy and forward moving direction.
Often American remakes of some foreign films do fall short.""Dinner For Schmucks"" was taken from the French film ""The Dinner Game (Le dner de cons)"",and to compare them is almost impossible.""The Dinner Game"" ,was very funny yet a little poignant .Schmucks I thought was funny but bizarre,a tepid thumbs up.",1327708800,,1005,4.781609195402299

454143,1,6302277760,"So, I sought this movie out a few years back for my wife, who had fond memories of watching this with her childhood best friend.  I paid an arm and a leg for it on E-Bay only to get a VHS copy of the film that was visibly `worn'.  Despite the package it came in, the film played fine.  Sadly, I wish that the VHS tape had been broken and I didn't have to suffer through this horrid film.  I love Martin Short.  I guess I should take that back.  I like Martin Short usually, and can love him occasionally, but here he is just wasted on a hapless script that goes nowhere with gags that suffer from lack of any real wit.  The film just falls apart because it can't muster up a single ounce of originality or actual comedic timing.  I can't think of a single scene in this film where I even smiled; it was that unfunny.  Glover and Short are wasted here, and the film has zero redeemable factors, to the point where I really just wanted to turn it off but couldn't because I didn't want to hurt my wife's feelings.  I had to force a smile until the film ended and she told me that it wasn't what she remembered and I let out a sigh of relief as we both laughed at how dumb the movie was.  Basically, Short is reduced to a series of endless accidents.  He trips, he trips again, he falls, he runs into something then he trips again.

This Martin Short gem is probably my favorite movie of his (aside from the Father of the Bride series) and it seems to be so undervalued. I loved this movie waaaaay back when and I looooooove it now. So many bad things happen to him during this hilarious and irreverent movie and even after all my many, many viewings, I still seem to eagerly anticipate all his misfortunes. The way he just takes all his many ""accidents"" in stride is what I love about it. And Danny Glover's horrified fascination is also priceless and perfectly played.

The actual dvd itself leaves something to be desired, though. There isn't even a menu. The film immediately plays once you pop it in to the dvd player and once the credits have finished it just starts all over again.

454273,4,6302277760,"I have been waiting for Pure Luck to come out on DVD since they started making DVDs back in the 90s. Here's why I gave it 4 stars:

Pros - ""Pure Luck"" is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Martin Short is flat out hilarious in every scene, and Danny Glover is the perfect costar to balance out the comedy. My family used to watch ""Pure Luck"" on a regular basis, and I have searched everywhere for the DVD for years, and until now it hasn't been available. I ordered it immediately when it became available on Amazon.

Cons - Instead of the typical DVD format, I think this is merely a recording of the VHS version of the movie. The screen resolution has noticeably less definition than most DVDs. Also, there is no menu; it just starts playing when you put it in, and the menu button just takes you to the beginning of the movie. You can advance to chapters at least using the forward and reverse buttons.

Knowing this, I would still recommend buying the movie, as I doubt it will be released in another format if it hasn't been converted to DVD after all these years. It is clean comedy classic that anyone will love.

Amazon is currently the only place to get ""Pure Luck"" on DVD, and I wholeheartedly recommend that you buy it, because for some reason beyond my comprehension, this might be the only way to get it on disc.",1266364800,7,1335,4.328

The exasperated detective on the case (Danny Glover) is packed off with the chosen stooge (Martin Short), and the ultimate odd couple endure a series of hilarious mishaps as they literally stumble along the path of their quarry.

Slapstick that works!  It skips a lot of the clichs, isn't too obvious, and is largely situational - if anything can go wrong, it will.  Martin is a naive hothead who delivers physical comedy with style, and Glover is a hard-boiled P.I.-cum-babysitter who just can't believe this is all happening to him.",1254873600,,978,4.820359281437126

I kept telling her ""yeah, it's great writing - but you have to SEE Martin Short eating that salt while trying to pretend that it's no big deal.  HILARIOUS!""

This movie isn't on DVD?!?!?!?  Are you effing KIDDING me?!  This is one of the funniest films of Martin Short's career!  I have spent WAY too long (it's embarrassing, really) sifting through the Hollywood BILE that makes up the Walmart DVD bargain bin.  I'm utterly insulted that some of those titles were made into DVD and not this ridiculously funny movie.  I guess it must have been made by a small production company or there were legal issues or something stupid.  I don't know how Hollywood works, but to let a jewel like this slip through the cracks while making movies like the ones I see in the bargain bin into DVD's is a shame. A crying shame.

454357,4,6302277760,"Very good remake of the French film ""La Chevre"" (""Knock on the Wood""). First and last good film by director Nadia Tass.
Valerie (Sheila Kelley) is unluckiest women on the face of the Earth. She disappears in Mexico without the trace and nobody have any clue what happen. Her frustrated rich father taking his last chance with very odd team: ""Private Eye"" Ray (Danny Glover) and Eugene, unluckiest man on the face of the Earth ( Martin Short). The plan is simple: go to Mexico and let Eugene just be himself. Did it work? Sure it did, but you have to se how.
This comedy is 100% pure fun. The only one reason why I gave it 4 stars is the French film, which I've seen many times. No one can beat a  French team of Grard Depardieu and Pier Rishard.
