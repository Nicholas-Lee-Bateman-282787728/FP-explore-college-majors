8715252,4,B00X7HEILA,"If you're looking for a Nordic Noir fix; best to look elsewhere.  Okay, it involves crime(s) and the polices attempts to solve them: thus, we follow in the footsteps of the (almost obligatory) troubled young female detective and the somewhat hapless male partner she has foisted upon her.  But its a Nordic saga with a difference!

Basically, a child has gone missing from the same town from which said detectives own daughter disappeared some years before.  Being the daughter of the late indigenous captain of industry, who owned the local cellulose plant, she is home to sort out his estate.  But we soon become aware that there are some very strange goings on and this is not going to be a straightforward police procedural.  Instead it appears to be a rather curious melange of eco-nut/fantasy folk-lore/new-agey/anti-capitalist/police procedural type thing with vague undercurrents of science fiction (a la Day of the Triffids) and even a sprinkling of H. P. Lovecraft!

There are various potential minor irritations; e.g. the lead character does particularly silly things at various times you wouldnt expect of a trained, experienced police detective, but those aside, its a different, quirky and intriguing series with a bit more interest than the usual run-of-the-mill police procedural and well worth sticking with.",1442102400,6,1325,5.251184834123222
8715253,5,B00X7HEILA,"I was not sure what to expect when I started watching this series, as I knew only a little bit about the storyline. It turned out to be very unique and extremely absorbing to watch. It combines elements of fantasy and mythology in a very realistic way, making the storyline believable and easy to relate to. It starts out appearing to be a crime drama, but then it expands into a much deeper, mysterious storyline with fantasy elements and many unexpected turns. There wasn't a single character I did not like, and all of them are very complex. The acting is very well-done and natural as well, and every episode of full of suspense and drama that made me eager to watch the next episode. I was sad once I finished the series, since it is only 10 episodes and I have never seen another series quite like it. I hope there will eventually be another season made, and I highly recommend Jordskott to anyone who likes dramas, mysteries, thrillers, and fantasy. It is a very entertaining and thought-provoking story that I think everyone could enjoy watching. The version I purchased is the region 2 UK release, so it will not likely play on standard US region 1/region A DVD/Blu-ray players, but it worked for me on my all-region DVD player. The audio is in Swedish with English subtitles, and there are also a few special features that show a making-of video clip with cast and creator interviews.",1442016000,6,1394,4.625
