4229754,4,B003YJFALI,As an Aussie customer I have to say you would find a similar selection of women in any Australian capital city or even country town. Realistically portrayed. If you are looking for a realistic representation of various Lesbian lives.....Here it is ! and maybe the title says it all. Even if you don't really like individual characters you will enjoy the lives they lead.,1305331200,4,370,4.796875
4229755,5,B003YJFALI,"I absolutely love this series! It's really great to finally have a reality show that recognises a different society. If you are gay then it is definitely something you can relate to on a personal level and if you are straight, it is a great insight into the world and lives of the gay community. I love the women of the show and can empathise with so many of their experiences. Well worth the watch if you have ever wanted to know more about lesbian relations or if you are just interested in the lives of fellow lesbians. FIVE stars!!!",1298937600,8,536,4.37
4229756,2,B003YJFALI,"So I'm sure that this show is awesome, however I am not particularily happy about opening the package up only to find that ALL 3 dvd's were missing. This is the first time I've had a problem with Amazon. I plan on returning the item for a replacement and hopefully this time I get what I paid for. I am currently deployed so trying to find time to get to the post office with my schedule is going to be rough. Thanks Amazon.",1298678400,3,424,4.120481927710843
4229757,5,B003YJFALI,"Since the first episode I watched I was already in love with The Real L Word! It is true what the previews say, the women of The L Word teased us for 6 seasons so I'm totally happy that Showtime came out with a spin off! I do agree with one of the other comments that was made about this show, there does need to be more of a span on the actresses selected for these shows! Although The Real L Word was guaranteed success from watching the previews alone, the show needs more different cultures represented who are apart of the lesbian world!",1297468800,2,542,4.221153846153846
4229758,5,B003YJFALI,I love the show its what's television needs for out and proud lesbians only thing I do hope for is that maybe the producers or creator of the look at more african americans in the future.  The dvd came welled package got to my place on time and good condition I love making purchases from amazon never had a problem. The special features on The Real L Word were a little disappointing I was expecting more in depth of what went on with the ladies after the show.  I do hope to see Natalie again i loved her.,1295049600,5,507,4.163265306122449
4229759,5,B003YJFALI,The dvd set came in fast. The only thing I didn't like about the purchase is the season special features were not that great.,1293062400,,125,4.25
4229760,5,B003YJFALI,"Ilene Chaiken manages to hit another softball homerun with her spin-off series ""The Real L Word""! The show has six main characters, and a smattering of regularly appearing friends/girlfriends/family.  Each woman offers a unique insight to the lesbian scene in LA, and they all face personal triumphs and tribulations throughout the season.  I feel like the women are relatable to anyone watching, regardless of the viewers' sexual orientation.  Every woman is in a different place when it comes to her sexuality.  Whether it be Rose, who seemingly doesn't care what other people think about her lifestyle choices (including but in exclusively her sexuality). Or, Tracy, who's trying to balance her own mother's insecurities about Tracy's sexuality and developing a relationship with her girlfriend. Each episode offers mini-vignettes that occasionally intersect on camera. There are a few things that have raised concerns about this show: the main issue appears to be the lack of diversity among the cast. However, two cast members, Nikki and Jill are engaged and spend the season planning their nuptials, and their both Jewish; and that doesn't make up for the lack of diversity, but there is some, to be fair. Hopefully, with a more expansive casting for additional seasons, viewers will have an opportunity to widen their scope. The series is worth the price and your time!",1288051200,22,1376,5.212669683257919

4229766,5,B003YJFALI,"This review is one the second season reviews since I bought both at the same time from the same seller.

I bought seasons 1 & 2 from DvdBargainBuy. Great seller. Both seasons arrived early together, brand new and in perfect condition. I checked to see if there were scratches on the discs & there were none on any of them. All discs were there, both seasons (disks, cases) were free of any defects. I'm extremely satisfied.",1393977600,,423,4.565789473684211
4229767,1,B003YJFALI,"DVD sucked and couldn't resale it because, though it was a new DVD, the case was broken. Dont know what to do with it now.",1389916800,,122,3.92

4229769,3,B003YJFALI,"I received the first season today. I am disappointed in the packaging! The bottom corner of the case is broken. As soon as I opened it I had to check the condition of the actual DVDs. They are fine, no scratches or anything of that sort. So I don't find the need to send it back as it would be a waste of time to do so.",1374624000,,319,3.7761194029850746
4229770,4,B003YJFALI,Product came back obviously used but fairly new. Only problem is the disk holder was broken so l have to be careful when opening the DVD,1367366400,,136,4.269230769230769
4229771,5,B003YJFALI,best show on tv for sure. love it more than words. so glad we own the set now. for sure something everyone in the lgbt community would love.,1364601600,,140,4.035714285714286
4229772,5,B003YJFALI,this is an amazing show LOVED it.. i would rather see this then Washington heights.. would defiantly buy the second and future seasons,1359244800,,134,4.869565217391305

Cheers Kerryn",1359158400,,138,4.148148148148148
4229774,5,B003YJFALI,Make sure the kids are in bed asleep before watching this... Not too bad for a lesbian reality show ....,1355875200,,104,4.25
4229775,5,B003YJFALI,"I'll just keep this review short, because I have a lot more to say about season 2 (and I'm writing that review right after this).  This was a great reality show because it was multidimensional, classy, and intelligent.  The reality characters (actress isn't the right word I guess) are varied in their personalities, goals in life, ect.  And because of that, so were the situations in the show.  It was refreshing to watch this since there really aren't any lesbian reality shows, and at least half of the reality shows on TV are complete trash.  Bottom line, buy this and watch it.  Can't say the same about season 2 though.",1349481600,2,625,4.636363636363637
4229776,5,B003YJFALI,Highly recommended for anyone...gay or straight. Entertaining and you won't be able to stop watching until you reach the end lol.,1341792000,,129,5.190476190476191
4229777,5,B003YJFALI,I love reality TV and I love this series! As a lesbian I was so pleased to see a show that shows all different types of lives we live. I love this show and can't wait for season 3 to come!!!,1334620800,,190,3.658536585365854
4229778,4,B003YJFALI,"Without a doubt if you are a fan of the scripted drama The L Word, check out the reality show verison The Real L Word!  These ladies show you how LA lesbians have a great time.  With every good reality show, drama is not too far from the corner and you will be taken for a ride with it in it's opening season.  My favorite cast member is Whitney.  While she does have her fair share of drama with the same-sex, she's hot and makes season 1 intriguing.  This season has won me over hopefully it does for you!",1323734400,2,507,4.08080808080808
4229779,5,B003YJFALI,Arrived in good box everything was good but the quilty of the DVDs when playing the discs don't look that well it looks a littlebit blurry,1322352000,,138,4.346153846153846
4229780,5,B003YJFALI,"The Real L Word was an absolute joy to watch, and I liked that season 1 was very diverse between each of the couples. It shows how lesbians are just like anyone else, and it was just very interesting watching everyone during their everyday lives.

I received my copy rather quickly, a few days before the expected date.",1309564800,,319,4.5
