5108846,4,B007RKFXTE,"I collect mysteries from the 30s, 40s and 50s, so my standards may be different than the casual viewer- we are not talking Citizen Kane here, but if you are into the genre, this needs to be part of any comprehemsive collection",1350864000,25,226,4.404761904761905
5108847,5,B007RKFXTE,Great old mystery movie and the seller shipped quickly - if you are a fan (like me) of these 30s and 40s mysteries then you would do well to add this to your collection.,1350086400,17,169,4.0

5108850,5,B007RKFXTE,Love the access to old lesser known movies.  Good quality,1420502400,,57,4.7
5108851,3,B007RKFXTE,"For me, it was a bit underwhelming!  What I mean by that is it didn't have much suspense.  I was a bit surprised by the ending but other than that, it was just okay for a rainy Sunday afternoon when there isn't much to watch on the TV! If you like to have old movies for your collection, then I would say ""buy"" it but if not, and you like suspense,you may want to pass on it but everyone is different in their opinions..that is why i purchased it in the first place, based upon the other reviews.",1418601600,,496,4.051020408163265

5108854,4,B007RKFXTE,Not as good as I thought it would be but it is still better than most movies - new or old.,1409616000,,90,3.3333333333333335

5108856,5,B007RKFXTE,"I really enjoyed watching this DVD movie and once again, as with other movies/series that I have ordered, had not heard of the Black Parrot.  I purchased because I just love mysteries.  If, like me, you also like a good mystery, you will not be unhappy with this one.",1402876800,5,267,4.428571428571429
5108857,4,B007RKFXTE,"Ordered because of comments made by others.  Glad.  Felt like the side kick cop.  They were knocking people off so fast I didn't catch the alibis or names, before they were off the suspect list for good!  :D :D :D  I am surprised I hadn't seen this before....  Enjoyable.",1398729600,2,271,4.428571428571429
5108858,5,B007RKFXTE,"What a great mystery from the early 1940's.  I am addicted to these older black-and-white mysteries and this one does not disappoint.  A ""killer cabinet"" . . . a master thief . . . a handsome leading man in William Lundigan and the great addition of Paul Cavanagh who (whom?) many may be familiar with from his appearances in a couple of the ""Sherlock Holmes"" series with Basil Rathbone.  Since this is from the Warner Bros Archive series, you will need a DVD play-only or Blu-Ray player to view.  Have fun!",1393027200,10,507,4.538461538461538
5108859,5,B007RKFXTE,"I loved this movie, as an old classic movie, and I will keep it in my collection as one of the finest olsie suspense.",1384646400,2,117,3.9166666666666665
5108860,3,B007RKFXTE,"This is a good example of the noir style.  Enjoyed the plot, it reminded me of some of the old Charlie Chan plots.",1381104000,,114,3.9565217391304346
5108861,5,B007RKFXTE,this is a good classic noir...i enjoyed watching the movie...i like the classic mysteries...this one is no exception...if you like seeing a a good classic mystery movie...or just pure entertainment...this is for you.,1379894400,8,216,5.575757575757576
5108862,4,B007RKFXTE,"this was a classic B movie the imaging was not that good, I don't think the original film was not that well preserved",1378512000,,117,4.130434782608695
5108863,5,B007RKFXTE,This is a good mystery with some of those special twists so common and popular in movie mysteries of the 1940's.  This is an enjoyable hour worth of entertainment that is not too deep and yet not silly.  Its just a good black and white mystery movie.,1373241600,,250,4.297872340425532
5108864,3,B007RKFXTE,"Not the exciting, elusive detective film I had hoped for.  Its ok, the acting is passable but compare it to a Thin Man or even a good Charlie Chan and it lacks the charm or mystery.",1369785600,,181,4.027777777777778
5108865,5,B007RKFXTE,"My husband and I never heard of this, ordered it, and really enjoyed it.  The company we ordered from sent it right away.  I always feel safe with Amazon, have never been let down, even when a product was the wrong one twice.  It was quickly resolved.  Movie Mystery Noir fans will enjoy this.",1366761600,,293,4.37037037037037
5108866,5,B007RKFXTE,If you like the old Charlie Chan type mystery's you will like the case of the Black Parrot . It has been restored and the picture is very clean . A great surprise ending !,1361577600,,171,3.914285714285714
5108867,5,B007RKFXTE,"I enjoyed this picture on mainly two levels.  First, it is a well-done  ""who-done-it"" and the denouement is surprising. I didn't guess it. It was based on a stage play which usually is a good indication of quality. But my main source of pleasure is in seeing a very young and very handsome William Lundigan. He is truly beautiful in this picture and a fine actor as well. For Lundigan fans, this picture is a  ""sine qua non"".  As far as the technical quality is concerned, I think everything - the video and audio are fine.  A high recommendation for classic picture enthusiasts, Lundigan fans, or mystery buffs.",1355961600,31,612,4.62962962962963

8521380,5,B007RKFXTE,this was first time seeing this movie and it was very enjoyable.  love black and white movies/tv.  sometimes it seems that color detracts from the quality of the show.  this is a good mystery noir and one i'll be watching again.  glad it's part of my library and that i decided to buy it.,1468368000,,288,4.277777777777778
