7798782,5,1575238489,"This VHS videotape contains Episode #2 in the excellent four-part cable-TV documentary series ""Survival In The Sky"", which was released on VHS by TLC Video in the year 2000.

This mini-series, narrated with his usual perfection by Will Lyman, probes a variety of commercial aviation accidents that have occurred over the last several decades, including the five ""Deadly Weather"" airliner crashes explored in this installment.

Archival video and film footage is coupled with recent interviews featuring surviving passengers of the various accidents and interviews with crash investigators to help explain why these airplanes suffered their crippling malfunctions.

The five air disasters that are focused on in this ""Deadly Weather"" volume are as follows:

1.) The January 13, 1982, crash of ""Palm 90"", an Air Florida Boeing 737-200 which took off in near-blizzard conditions from National Airport in Washington, D.C., and crashed into the Potomac River just seconds after lifting off.

This famous air crash comes complete with extremely dramatic and heartbreaking video, as rescuers attempt to pluck the only five Palm 90 survivors from the icy Potomac. You'll see the footage of bystander-soon-to-be-hero Lenny Skutnik as he dives into the freezing river to save a female passenger who was about to perish due to the cold conditions she was experiencing. Incredible ""Live"" footage indeed.

This crash, I suppose, does belong within this ""Deadly Weather"" segment of the documentary mini-series -- but, while the snowy, cold weather conditions were indeed a contributory cause for the accident, those adverse conditions weren't the main reason for Palm 90 dropping out of the Washington sky.

Pilot error was the ultimate cause of this disaster, after if was determined (incredibly) that the pilots had failed to activate the 737's anti-icing systems before taking off. It was a monumental blunder that took 79 lives -- including 5 people on the 14th Street bridge in Washington, who lost their lives when the jetliner struck the bridge just prior to going into the river.

This video includes replays from Flight 90's CVR (Cockpit Voice Recorder) as the airplane took off and then slammed into the bridge. It's one of the most violent CVR cockpit recordings I've ever heard, with the sound of the plane impacting the bridge resulting in an enormous and ear-splitting ""bang"" on the CVR tape -- which came just an instant after this frightening exchange between the pilot and co-pilot:

""We're going down, Larry!""

""I know it!""

2.) The loss of American Eagle Flight 4184 near the small town of Roselawn, Indiana, on October 31, 1994. The ATR-72 propliner, carrying 68 passengers and crew members on a flight from Indianapolis to Chicago, nose-dived into a field after experiencing icing conditions while circling in a holding pattern prior to landing at Chicago's O'Hare Airport.

The ice build-up on the winged surfaces of the aircraft eventually led to an uncommanded rudder deflection, causing the plane to roll sharply. The pilots could not control the plane at this point and it plummeted to the ground at a speed of 450-500 MPH. No one survived.

-------------------------

3.) Chapter 3 of this program revolves around the crash of Delta Airlines Flight 191 on August 2nd, 1985, in Dallas, Texas. The widebodied Lockheed L-1011 Tri-Star jetliner crashed short of Runway 17-Left at DFW Airport while attempting to land during a severe thunderstorm.

After striking the ground, the crippled jet crossed a busy highway (killing one person in a car) and then smashed into two huge water tanks that held millions of gallons of water apiece. 134 people on board the plane were killed. 29 survived the crash.

One of the highlights of this Delta 191 chapter is footage taken inside an L-1011 simulator when a Delta training pilot attempts to re-create Flight 191's desperate plight. This is fascinating footage, as we see the simulator bouncing all over the place and the pilot struggling to keep his L-1011 in the air during the heavy thunderstorm that rages outside.

The southern-accented pilot talks to his airplane as well during this simulated attempted landing -- ""Wow! Look at the tailwind! We've got a heck of a tailwind here! Oh my God! Come on, come on, airplane! Come on, fly baby! Come on, you can make it!"" -- making this segment of the video seem even more surreal.

The pilot in the simulator did not manage to land his L-1011 safely. Just like the real Flight 191, the re-creation in the simulator resulted in the plane crashing short of the runway due to the intense weather.

If anybody thinks that landing a big airliner in heavy weather is a piece of cake, they should watch this amazing ""In The Simulator"" footage that TLC has provided for this documentary. Scary, but fascinating, stuff to be sure.

The 1985 Delta accident prompted airlines and airports to install more sophisticated equipment for detecting the dangerous phenomenon known as ""wind shear"".

-------------------------

4.) The fourth and fifth accidents examined in this program are related to one another -- exploring the mystery of why two different Boeing 737s suddenly dropped out of the sky for no discernible reason in 1991 and again in 1994.

The loss of United Airlines Flight 585 on March 3rd, 1991, began the 737 mystery. That Boeing twin-jet dove into the ground while attempting a landing at Colorado Springs, Colorado, in very windy conditions. All 25 souls on board died.

-------------------------

5.) When another Boeing 737 (US Air Flight 427) inexplicably crashed while on final approach near Pittsburgh on September 8, 1994, it raised a whole lot of eyebrows at Boeing. For it appeared that the 737, the most popular airplane in the sky, had some kind of major, undetected flaw.

The US Air crash claimed 132 lives, with nobody surviving the accident after the plane encountered a severe ""wake vortex"" air stream that had been emitted by the jet preceding US Air 427 into Runway 28R at Pittsburgh.

The wake turbulence caused an uncommanded movement in the 737's tail rudder (similar to what occurred three years earlier at Colorado Springs). Investigators finally came to the conclusion that the probable cause for the US Air crash was a faulty valve inside the plane's tail rudder system, causing the rudder to move all by itself.

If either of the 737s that crashed had been at a higher altitude, it's very likely the pilots would have been able to save each plane. But, as fate would have it, both jets were at a very low altitude when their respective unwanted rudder deflections occurred, with very little time (and virtually no altitude) to correct the situation.
