1179131,4,B000003KE0,"Based upon the radio play by Lucille Fletcher (it was originally performed with verve by the great Agnes Moorehead on radio), this film earned Stanwyck the last of her four Oscar nominations. As the self-centered Leona, Stanwyck gives a terrific performance as the constantly nagging woman who keeps herself bedridden because she believes herself to have a weak heart (she doesn't). Could Leona - perchance - be what is called a hypochondriac? Lancaster is good as her husband who learns the truth about his wife's ""condition"" from her doctor (he becomes enraged and decides to seek sweet revenge for all the emotional pain he's been put through due to Leona's hypochondriac fantasy). The photography is excellent, and while the simple plot is stretched into movie length, the performances keep the viewer watching until the inevitable conclusion. Lucille Fletcher adapted her own 22-minute radio play for the screen and in so doing created a complex background for the characters who bring the heroine to the point of the original.  This was often accomplished in flashback technique by the brilliant director Anatole Litvak.  Stanwyck couldn't have been better in the part of the neurotic and selfish wife who so dominates her husband that he turns to crime for self-expression.......Lancaster is grimly persuasive as the homicidal husband...........Many consider this to be one of Stanwyck's top performances; it seems to me that the film as a whole is underrated in that it IS indeed a filmization of a radio play; therefore it doesn't quite come off as everyone's cup of tea!  In my opinion, this holds up better, for instance, than the obvious and mechanical filmed play in which Hitchcock filmed in 1954 entitled DIAL M FOR MURDER!",960595200,,1738,5.112676056338028
1179132,4,B000003KE0,"""Sorry, Wrong Number"" has to be one of the most well-done suspense films to come along.  Adapted by the writer of the famous radio play that starred Agnes Moorehead, Barbara Stanwyck brings to life the  invalid socialite who overhears a telephone conversation that will send her  into a panic for the rest of her bedridden evening.  Burt Lancaster is well  cast as her neer-do-well husband, whom we learn is not as devoted as he  seems.
The story is told in a series of flashbacks by various characters  that Ms. Stanwyck encounters on the telephone, that one by one leads up to  the shocking climax of the film.  This film is perfect to watch with  friends and family on a Saturday night with the lights off, to experience  fear without the need for violence and gore.  Filmmakers of today should  take a lesson.",958694400,5,813,4.640845070422535
1179133,4,B000003KE0,"Though not quite as gripping as the original radio play,  this is nonetheless a fine exercise in suspense.  Barbara Stanwyck and Burt Lancaster lead a fine cast through the classic story of the sinister plot  overheard on the phone.  Indeed, the telephone is a major player in the  cast and plotline.  There are some better film-noir thrillers out there,  but this one is still a ""must.""  Highly recommended.",956275200,4,408,4.897058823529412
1179134,5,B000003KE0,"""Have you ever been to Staten Island, Leona?""  That's my favorite line (besides the clinching ""Sorry, wrong number"") in this engrossing vintage B&W melodrama.  Ride along at night on the  ferry to the deserted, moonlit far end of Staten Island as the mystery  unfolds in flashback. Or gaze out the window of Barbara Stanwyck's east  side apartment toward the Queensboro Bridge, now a silent, sinister prop in  a murder plot overheard on crossed phone lines.  It's a cold, very  disturbing (especially for 1948) murder plot and the tension builds  methodically, inexorably toward the climax.  As bedridden Leona, Barbara  Stanwyck turns in a patented spoiled rich girl act, and Burt Lancaster  makes a fine brooding, on-the-make husband.  Both characters are ironically  likable at film's end.  Not a whole lot of action but tons of 40s  atmosphere and great shots of NYC.",942192000,3,871,5.114285714285714
1179135,4,B000003KE0,"Barbara is not in this movie enough.  That's why I gave it four stars.  I also don't like Burt Lancaster, but you're not really supposed to.  The plot is well known:  woman hears murder plotted over telephone, could it be  hers?  Maybe. This movie is incredibly suspenseful, but I knew what was  going to happen.  I heard the radio version of the movie (with Burt and  Barbara, not Agnes Moorehead).  Amazingly enough, Barbara plays an invalid.  An invalid that walks around.  However, with flashbacks, you can see her,  chipper and spoiled as always.  Barbara starts to look rather disheveled as  her character gets more and more frightened.  It's quite effective.  That  and the fact that Barbara screams really well.  This is a good movie, and I  highly recommend it.",932342400,2,770,4.821705426356589

Was shocked to see that studio execs first wanted starlet Laraine Day to play the part of spoiled heiress Leona Cotterell.  Yes, Stanwyck was a bit long in the tooth to play her, perhaps, but she'd honed the acting chops needed to get viewers to care about the peril she is in and to realize her narcissism has damaged her even more than it has those around her.  Burt Lancaster is sexy and virile in one of his first starring roles as the long-suffering husband who attempts to break out from under Leona's thumb with dangerous results.  Also loved the young William Conrad as a Mafia goodfella (and Lancaster's nemesis), Harold Vermilyea as a chemist who becomes embroiled in a conspiracy that goes horribly wrong and Ed Begley as Leona's domineering Dad.  Loved it!  Franz Waxman's film score, which adds to the ever-growing tension in the film, is a big plus.",1482969600,6,927,4.656441717791411

1179532,4,B000003KE0,"Not all suspense films as is more and more the case these days have to depend of techno-gizmos, or weird plot shifts to throw you off the scent. Take the film under review, Sorry, Wrong Number, a black and white film from back in the 1940s. Most of the action, most serious action takes place in a well-kept bedroom, a bedroom with a single women beside a telephone, a telephone very useful to the plot line but also a hellish instrument when she overhears a seemingly unrelated to her telephone call about a murder to be carried out for unknown reasons that very night. And while flashbacks detail how things have come to this past the womans increasingly disturbed mental state, the womans bedroom which includes a panoramic view of passing trains, and its confines determine what is going on.

Maybe the operative lesson to be learned, a cautionary tale if you will, in this 1948 Anatole Litvak-directed film is that you should not marry the boss daughter, period (or if you are the boss daughter let your man find his own way in the world, period). Here Leona (played by a suitably fear-struck and frantic Barbara Stanwyck) as a very fragile and sickly young woman, although according to a confidential doctors report she is physically fine so the symptoms seem to be psychosomatic, whose father has doted on her all her life is attracted to rough-hewn Henry (played by Burt Lancaster). Now Henry is from nowhere, a working class guy whom Leona eyes at a dance (and steals away from another woman). They meet and she, used to getting her own way always, draws a bee-line for him. Being from nowhere Henry, whatever attractions she holds for him, is ambitious, has a million ideas about becoming his own man, can also see that she can through her father help him along in his ambitions to be somebody.

And that is where the boss daughter angle gets full play, and gets the story-line moving to its fateful end. Leona and Henry marry and settle down with her father. A big mistake. Henry desperately wants to be his own man at something and holding a job in the fathers company, a big time pharma operation and under his roof makes him edgy. Makes him want to get out on his own. Leona though, her fathers daughter to a tee, takes a fit when Henry proposes they move out on their own. That set her heart problems going full throttle until she had become so overwrought that she had become bedridden as we see from the opening scene.

Henry though has decided, come hell or high water, to make it on his own by fair means or foul. He gets involved, gets involved way over his head, with some bad hombres to whom he sells stolen chemicals from his father-in laws plant. They pressure him into signing an I.O.U. for big dough which he had not got when he tries to cut them out of the cycle. They, not the kind to be left standing with no dough, suggest that his sick wife has a big insurance policy issued on her life, a policy that should be come due very soon. Hence the conversation on the telephone that she had overheard as she pieces everything together is a plan to murder her, murder her that very night. As she learns more she gets more frantic, particularly when she hears a prowler downstairs whom she cant do anything about (or won't if you go by the doctors report). In the end despite a last minute call from Henry who tells her go to the window and yell bloody murder (almost literally) to save her life the villains work is done. Henry who had been under investigation about the stolen chemicals is as she is being murdered apprehended by the cops. Yeah, maybe it is best to just not marry the boss daughter and leave it at that. Sorry, Henry, sorry but your pleas were too late and you are going to take the big step-off on this one, no question.",1441411200,,3763,4.474526928675401

 I also liked that Burt's character actually did have some initial strong feelings for his wife, not just the usual gold digger type of tale.

Stanwyck was nominated for best female lead for her role as an invalid who believes she has been connected to a wrong phone number and hears a plot to kill an anonymous woman. Great thriller and part of our American film culture.  If you have never watched movies from the 20's thru the mid sixties you are really missing out.  As much as I love some of todays films, few come close to what was offered in those years in Hollywood. Barbara Stanwyck is now a legend along with so many other greats. She could do anything they gave her to do. Her range was truly amazing. From comedy in the movie Ball of Fire to heartbreaking drama in Stella Dallas she was flawless.  This is a wonderful thriller to start with if you haven't watched any of the older movies that Hollywood produced back in what some call the Golden Age of Hollywood.",1425168000,,932,4.375722543352601

1179659,3,B000003KE0,"I wanted to watch this again after a million years but really didn't enjoy it. While Barbara Stanwyck is an impeccable actress and delivered a stellar performance, the character she portrayed made it almost impossible to enjoy. I'd forgotten what a nuisance that character is! In fact, now I remember why I never really enjoyed her in much of anything. Most of the time it seems she plays irritating women -- something that Hollywood did a lot of back then. Women were either brain dead adoring, strippers, or bossy and irritating. The performance by Stanwyck gets 5 stars, but the irritating character only gets 3. If you can get past the dysfunction and focus on the quality of her acting, you'll enjoy it.",1424217600,,708,4.764227642276423

Atmospheric and taut. Not Stanwyck's best but a good chiller.",1424044800,2,392,4.535211267605634

1179699,4,B000003KE0,"There really isn't much to complain about when it comes to ""Sorry, Wrong Number"", except Barbara Stanwyck's constant bitching and many outburst of yelling at other cast members attempts to ""help"" her through a long night of fear and confusion to the situation she finds herself in, seldom letting go of her self-centered and complete selfishness in personal character, a major personality flaw that a saint would have a hard time dealing with.  But aside from her over-distraught brand of acting, this movie would not be nearly as good or a major classic without her, any other actress of the day could never take her place in this picture, or even half-way fill her shoes.  the main story is so well knows after all these years that it would be pointless to re-tell and would also be a movie spoiler.  A first class mystery all the way, most film buffs of this type of movie will not only enjoy this, many will even love it. Production is first class, everyone involved in the making of this film handle their duties with top efforts, and though the running time is only 89 minutes, it never seems too short in story content, overly fast in action, or light in character development.  As close to a memorable film classic, memorable story line as they come.

Lancaster is effective a her frustrated husband who is chafing at his role in her father's corporation who wants to branch out on his own, something Stanwyck absolutely shuts down every time he brings up the subject.

Yes, the plot is dated--woman overhears two people conspiring to murder someone and it turns out she is that person, but the actors give good performances and the ending is appropriately shocking.

I believe that it packed a punch in its day (1948) but today it lacks suspense and relies almost entirely (as many of her films did) on Babs Stanwyck's entertaining histrionics. The plot (original perhaps in 1948 but much copied since) involves a bedridden woman intercepting a call on a  crossed telephone line and realizing she has been marked for murder that very night. Oddly it does not make for very rivetting viewing. Barbara was nominated for her fourth Oscar (she never won but was awarded an honorary Academy Award decades later). Born Ruby Stevens and for eleven years married to actor Robert Taylor there were always rumours abounding that Babs was a lesbian.

To have recalled how suspenseful it was, after all these years, says something about its impact. Barbara Stanwyck plays a wealthy, spoiled, selfish woman who is used to getting what she wants and becomes ill when she doesn't. Her domineering father (Ed Begley), has her convinced, since her youth, that she is not well. He also dominates her relationship with her ambitious husband (played by Burt Lancaster), whom he disapproves of but controls by making him an executive in his firm. Burt's character wants a chance to prove he's worthy of his heiress wife, but knows he'll never get ahead under his father-in-law's heavy thumb. So, he gets involved in a dangerous scheme that ultimately endangers his wife. As the story begins in the present, Barbara's character is an invalid, alone at home in bed, waiting for her husband to come home from work. When he doesn't show, she makes a call to his office, only to overhear an outside conversation on the line, wherein the callers seem to be planning a murder. Eventually, through other phone calls she makes, she realizes that she is the murder target. Much of the story is told in flashbacks, paced briskly enough to stay interesting and, at times, gripping.

1179971,4,B000003KE0,"SORRY, WRONG NUMBER (1948)

This film originally appeared in 1943 on the ""Suspense"" radio program and starred Agnes Moorehead in the role of Mrs. Stevenson. In expanding the 30-minute radio play to an 89 minute film, Lucille Fletcher employed a flashback device which, IMO, oiled a riveting suspenseful tale, effectively carrying the action along. Each flashback episode was ignited by a phone call and allowed the camera (thankfully) to stray outside Leona's bedroom.

It was during the flashback episodes that the wonderful cinematography of Sol Polito is used to best advantage. And it is stunning, espcially in the train station sequence wherein Sally (Ann Richards) is tailing her husband to find out what she can about her ex-boyfriend's involvement in a crime.

Barbara Stanwyck once again proves her stature as one of the greats (she received an Oscar nomination for this role). It must have been a real challenge trying to get the audience to sympathize with a rather unlikeable character. I believe she succeded in this challenge. Leona is spoiled and headstrong. She has convinced herself of having a life-threatening illness and, while she professes her love for Henry (Burt Lancaster), it's really just a sort of Narcisistic possesiveness. She won't hesitate to use her imagined illness to tightly control her husband, making his life a misery.

So, a fine cast, with a superb perfomance by Stanwyck, capable, if not excellent, direction by Anatole Litvak and a fine screenplay by Lucille Fletcher add up to a very good suspense thriller. It's the kind of film that, if condensed to its original 30-minute length, would have been a perfect vehicle for ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"". I say that mainly due to its shocking (though inevitable) conclusion. I am sooooo glad that they didn't weaken at the knees and provide some sort of phony ending wherein Henry saves his wife at the last minute and everything is hunkey-dorey.

Henry set the wheels in motion to commit murder, and though it's understandable that he might be made miserable by his controlling, overwhelming wife, a stronger man would have found a more suitable way to solve his problems. Our D-I-V-O-R-C-E, etc. and all that Tammy Wynette jazz. His attempt at warning her did little in my eyes to mitigate his role in the whole sordid business.

OK, is it noir? My vote would be yes. Stanwyck, from her sick bed, is the overwhelming femme-fatale. Lancaster the scheming, weak-willed husband. Henry is reacting to pressures from all sides: mobsters wanting to get back their piece of a very lucrative business, a wife, though perhaps not consciously, driving her husband away with her insane jealousy, an ex-girlfriend who's obviously still enough in love with Henry and not quite faithful enough to husband and family to stay out of it. And murder waiting in the wings. The death of Leona is horrifying and inevitable. Any other ending would have not been quite as logical.

This story rather reminds me of the writings of Roald Dahl (Lamb to the Slaughter) and would have fit in very nicely with one of Hitchcock's marvelous collections of short stories such as ""Stories For Late At Night"".",1277683200,9,3166,5.019047619047619
1179972,5,B000003KE0,"Lucille Fletcher's gripping story of a bed-bound woman who overheard her own murder being plotted when her phone connection was crossed made for one of the most exciting edge-of-your-seat thrillers ever produced for radio. Originally airing on Suspense with Agnes Moorehead in the lead role, and later Barbara Stanwyck, it would be broadcast an unprecedented seven times due to its incredible popularity. It was a forgone conclusion it would make it to film, and when it did, those who had doubted the claustrophobia of the radio version would translate well to the visual medium were treated to something every bit as good as what they'd heard over the airwaves while the lights were low.

Hal Wallis would produce more than one excellent noir melodrama with Barbara Stanwyck in the lead, and Sorry, Wrong Number was one of their finest collaborations. Stanwyck gives a very brave performance for a star of her caliber, allowing the audience to see a selfish and controlling woman hard to like through most of this film. It created sympathy for Burt Lancaster as her husband, Henry, who may have been bullied too far, and be in on the plot to kill her. In those nail-biting final moments, however, when Stanwyck is stripped and vulnerable, we see that it was insecurity that fueled her behavior, changing our opinion and creating panic in our hearts, as someone makes their way up the stairs.

A telephone is the link between life and death when Leona tries to call her husband from bed and somehow overhears the detailed conversation of two men plotting a woman's murder at 11:15 that night. Not thinking for a moment it was her own murder they were plotting, she tries desperately to have the operator connect her to someone who can help. Through phone calls, flashbacks and inventiveness on Livak's part, everything prior unfolds until the viewer is hanging on the next scene, wondering if it's headed where they think it is, and engrossed in how it got to that point. Leona stole Henry away from his Grassville sweetheart, Sally Hunt. Ann Richards is wonderful in creating sympathy for the girl Henry probably belonged with but was weak enough to lose. She still cares for him, and when her attorney husband seems to be focused on something big involving him, she has to find out if he's in any danger.

It is moody and atmospheric as she tails men to the beach and a house where mysterious signals precede the arrival by sea she knows can be no good for Henry. As she goes from phone to phone booth to give the desperate Leona a warning as the clock ticks, a story of Leona's suffocating love driving a weak man to take his chance at something his own is revealed. When Henry gets too greedy, however, it could be a vulnerable Leona who has to pay the price. William Conrad, whose own career had ties to radio, portraying Matt Dillon in Gunsmoke for years, is first-rate as the smarter crook, Morano. At 11:15 Henry has a change of heart and Leona realizes the phone call was about her own murder. But the footsteps on the stairs may be impossible to stop now. The viewer will find themselves leaning forward, willing her to get to the open window and scream for help. Stanwyck is magnificent here, just as on radio. Interestingly, Stanwyck would appear in an episode of Jack Benny's radio show in which he and the gang went to see this film, and afterward had a dream about it. Stanwyck had some great lines, and the spoof proved to be one of the most hilarious Benny ever did.

Beautifully photographed by Sol Polito, and framed by a suspenseful Franz Waxman score, director Antole Litvak gives this lonely and atmospheric thriller the wider scope required for the film medium through the use of flashbacks and shots of the harbor and bridge outside Leona's bedroom window. It is done so well the viewer never gets the sense this was once a radio play confined entirely to an invalid's bedroom. Having Tangerine playing on the car radio as Leona seduces Henry away from Sally is also a nice atmospheric touch, as it was playing softly down the street in a famous scene from Stanwyck's Double Indemnity as well. Harold Vermilyea is excellent as Henry's amiable accomplice who realizes before he does they are in over their heads. Wedell Corey, who would star with Stanwyck in another great Hal Wallis production, The File on Thelma Jordan, offers some good scenes as the doctor who clues Lancaster in on Leona's real condition.

This is film full of suspense and atmospheric touches, with a tremendous performance from Barbara Stanwyck no one who has seen this film ever forgets. A must see for classic film fans.",1272326400,4,4620,4.741293532338308
1179973,4,B000003KE0,"Sorry, Wrong Number

Exciting 1948 thriller based on a 45 minute radio play, starring Barbara Stanwyck as the paranoid, controlling rich woman, daughter of a rich drug company tycoon.  She falls in love and steals a man from a girlfriend of hers played by Ann Richards.  The Ann Richards character reminded me of Inger Stevens in a lot of ways -- sneaky, shy and cute.  Burt Lancaster plays the rough man from a poor neighborhood who becomes a milk-toast of a husband to Leona.

There is a lot of flashback in this story that detracts somewhat from the thriller aspect of things.  The Ann Richards character really does not add a lot to the story, except her following people around, spying on her husband (who is a police detective) and sneaking into beach houses and train stations.

The mysterious party line where Leona listens to a plot of murder at 11:15 that same night freaks out Leona.  What seems to freak her out even more is learning that her illness is psychosomatic -- ""Liars, liars!!""  Wow!

With a few slow points that are a bit hard to handle for the modern viewer, the ending is quite a tour de force.  Definitely a four star film, not on par with a Hitchcock thriller in my opinion, but still you gotta see a young Burt Lancaster (Birdman of Alcatraz).

Seeing a young William Conrad (Cannon TV series) as the gangster Moreno was a treat as well.

The DVD I had had minimal features, just a film trailer.

She overhears two men planning until she knows the truth. She will be the next one. Additionally she has developed a psychosomatic cardiac condition and her only contact with the outer world is her telephone.

The circling camera that moves from the array of useless medicines on her bedside table talks by itself about her terrible solitude. Henry is the henpecked husband who retracts himself since his original plan. Blackmailed by Morano who really wants to hasten the imminent death of his wife and so he can inherit her estate.

But, according the inherent tragic fatalism of the nor film, once the pieces moves forward, nothing can stop it and the late redemption has nothing to do about it.

Anatole Livak was one of the remarkable filmmakers who received with notable intensity, the invaluable heritage  of the German expressionism, using surrealistic and expressionistic  devices, the game of light and shadows with the night working out as sinister background.

Barbara Stanwyck made a towering performance who earned her a nomination as Best Actress for this tense movie that will maintain you at the border of your seat until the final statement: ""Sorry , wrong number.""",1252972800,,1335,5.013574660633484

We have all seen this strange kind of co-dependency in which the invalid uses emotional blackmail on the people encompased by the small sphere around them, and those encompassed love/hate catering to them.  It starts subtly, then turns literally into a ""man-eating monster,"" wanting more, more, more attention, creating more, more, more drama to get it.  The premise of the totally helpless person having to use a telephone as her only way of communicating with the outside world, or for entertainment, as there were not televisions all about then for that purpose, is a stroke of genius for the writer.  It is humorous now when we have become a society, quite pitiful indeed that has cell phones glued to ears.  What does that say about us?  Can we not go for a 24 hour period with out phone drama in our lives?  Very sad.  Both Barbara Stanwyck and Burt Lancaster seem miscast.  She usually plays tough, strong and often ruthless women.  Burt usually plays highly macho men.  In this production they play opposite roles, she is weak and helpless and pitiable, he seems to be a ""kept man"" by her father's pharmaceutical millions.

The movie is about a bed bound woman who over hears a plot to kill someone at 11:15 at night when her phone lines get crossed with another party. Through a serious of phone calls and flashbacks, the story builds as it pushes the viewer towards the edge finally unfolding in horrific fashion.

I really enjoyed the tension in SORRY, WRONG NUMBER and must say that it was fun to watch. Stanwyck is great as the nutty, spoiled rich wife and Lancaster is cast equally well as the hunky and kept husband.

The black & white movie is shown in full-screen format and I believe it falls under the film noir category. It also includes the trailer.

The film is very well handled and far from conventional. The characters are complex and the mystery that unravels is both intriguing in it's harsh expectedness and yet, surprising as well.

The cast all perform well including Burt Lancaster in an early role as the suspicious husband of Stanwyck, who is set up as her would be murderer.
Ending is a classic bit of dark cinema with a deliciously, blackly comic final line.

This film serves an important role in the evolution of film Noir in the presentation of it's central characters. Neither one is very likeable. Stanwyck henpecks Lancaster throughout and belittles him. She allows him absolutely no freedom and little in the way of confidence. She also turns out to be something of a hypochrondriac. Lancaster is aloof and maddening in his desire for financial freedom. His willingness to try ANYTHING to obtain security and escape disgrace and the law make him a somewhat despicable character.

Normally such things do not add up to create a good film, but the payoff becomes that much more satisfying in a morbid way and that much more intriguing. Seen as a reflection as the corruption of the spirit through ruthless ambition and apathy, the film remains fascinating. In this film that old saying remains true: Money IS the root of all evil.",1245024000,2,1634,4.863309352517986

1180009,4,B000003KE0,"Barbara Stanwyck was such a terrific actress that even though she is insanely miscast in this 1948 Anatole Litvak film as Leona, the wealthy invalid heiress who accidentally overhears a murder being plotted over the phone, she is still incredibly affecting and powerful. Agnes Moorehead has a terrific success in the original Lucille Fletcher radio play of the same name and was asked to reprise it six more times during her career, but the studio heads at Paramount chose to cast Stanwyck instead, whose Brooklyn accent seems exactly wrong for the wealthy Chicago-bred Leona and who seems extremely unconvincing in the scenes Fletcher added to her own radio play where Leona's supposed to be a college student (Stanwyck was forty when the film was made). To make Stanwyck's casting seem even more confusing, the producers chose Ed Begley, only six years Stanwyck's senior, as her adoring father the pharmaceutical king, and Burt Lancaster, six years Stanwyck's junior (but looking much younger with a long shock of light hair), as her morally corrupt husband. But once you get over this, Stanwyck makes the whole thing work just through her sheer nerve: when she begins to realize the woman the killers have been hired to get is actually herself, she becomes incredibly affecting and makes the work's famous finale unbearably suspenseful. Fletcher's attempts to ""open up"" the radio play have been hugely criticized for making the whole work too convoluted, but the director, Anatole Litvak, seems most animated by the beautiful haunting desolate beach scenes the expansion allows him to film which are supposedly set in Staten Island. With William Conrad as a mobster and Ann Richards as Leona's college roommate from Lancaster's character's Podunk hometown, each speaking in tones far too plummy and with diction far too excruciatingly correct to be very believable.",1231632000,,1868,5.188741721854305

1180050,4,B000003KE0,"My fellow reviewer M. Dalton perfectly sums up SORRY, WRONG NUMBER by calling it a ""nightmare noir"".  This darkly tense and truly disturbing movie stars Barbara Stanwyck (who could always be trusted to deliver the goods), in a top performance.

Filthy-rich invalid Leona Stevenson (Barbara Stanwyck) picks up the phone during a sultry New York summer night, and overhears a plot to murder her.  Could it be her husband Henry (Burt Lancaster), convieniently ""out of town""; or someone out to settle the score with her former best friend Sally (Ann Richards)?  As the night unfolds, a series of phonecalls guides Leona into a web of murder, drug theft and extortion.  Who can she trust...and how will the bed-ridden Leona defend herself from a mysterious assailant?

Barbara Stanwyck delivers a perfectly-pitched performance, as the movie unfolds and the character of Leona grows more desperate and panicked, the sheer artistry and talent of Stanwyck comes bubbling to the surface. Burt Lancaster is also fine as the husband who may or may not be part of the plot to murder his wife.  Australian-born character actress Ann Richards (not to be confused with the brunette American jazz singer), is a delight to watch as the jilted girlfriend who might also have an axe to grind with Leona.

Based around the popular radio play by Lucille Fletcher (which launched the career of Agnes Moorehead), SORRY, WRONG NUMBER benefits greatly from the added visuals of the motion picture.  We can observe the way Leona visibly changes and crumbles during the course of events, and thanks to some well-shot flashback scenes, Ms Stanwyck can leave the bed and play Leona during her courting days with the Burt Lancaster character.

Clipping along at a brisk pace, SORRY, WRONG NUMBER will be a must-see for classic noir fans as well as admirers of Barbara Stanwyck.  This is a tour-de-force from the amazing star of ""Stella Dallas"" and ""Double Indemnity"".

But the central mystery, disclosed bit by bit, remains intact until the final moments of the film. Stanwyck is in top form here as a shrill, demanding, paranoid, and ultimately hysterical presence, while Lancaster is winning as the headstrong husband determined to carve a place for himself in the world.

1180054,4,B000003KE0,"Barbara Stanwyck was Oscar nominated for Best Actress for her role as a neurotic, controlling heir in Sorry Wrong Number, but lost to Jane Wyman's performance in Johnny Belinda.  Stanwyck's screen performance as Burt Lancaster's domineering yet vulnerable wife is brilliant.  The last five minutes of the film still gives me chills.  Anatole Litvak who directs this 88 minute noir, successfully draws every ounce of Stanwyck's desperate emotions to film. Many critics thought that Lucille Fletcher's play would not transmitt as well on film, but Litvak's dark vision succeeds in every way.  Slow camera tracking that increases Stanwyck's isolationism, effective use of shadows, and flashback narratives all add tension to the film's climatic finale. In Gary Fishgall's autobiography of Burt Lancaster, he points out that Lancaster lobbied hard for the role of Stanwyck's weak, corruptable husband.  The role offered Lancaster a chance to expand his range as an actor by playing a character that departed from his tough-guy image. In Sorry Wrong Number the noir protagonist is no match for Stanwyck's dominating presence, even though she plays a woman whose neurotic fears confine her to a bed.  If you are a fan of film noir the Paramount Collection DVD is crisp and the black and whites never looked better.

1180097,5,B000003KE0,"This movie shows how much things have changed and yet have stayed the same. Take the opening charge of the movie:""In the tangled networks of a great city, the telephone is the unseen link between a million lives...it is the servant of our common needs--the confidante of our inmost secrets...life and happiness wait upon its ring...and horror...and loneliness...and death!"" With the advent of the cell phone, we have now become its servant. As for being a confidante, we are now all forced to listen to the private conversations of other people in public who can't seem to exist unless constantly squawking away on the little devices.

As for things remaining the same, the suspense devices used in this movie still work. It is from the ""film noir"" genre in which everyone involved is an unsympathetic character and the outcome is usually tragic. The part of the movie that is not done in flash-back has a gloomy look to it, in spite of Leona's opulant physical environment, that accentuates the impending doom of the situation. As for the plot, poor Henry Stevenson meets wealthy Leona and falls for her - or her money, or both, it's really hard to tell, even from Henry's perspective. Leona certainly falls for Henry, as much as she is capable of falling for anyone. They marry, but after the honeymoon, things begin to fall apart. Bored with their wealthy circumstances and easy lives, they each try to manipulate their own particular situations. Leona wants to hold on to Henry by controlling his every move as one would control a pet. Henry wants a chance to be his own man. Thus their individual goals are at odds with one another, and both are ultimately trapped by their own failings. Leona, however, seems to have the upper hand through a heart condition that causes her health to take a turn for the worse anytime someone disagrees with her. Thanks to her enabling father, played by the great Ed Begley, this doesn't happen very often, though, until Henry comes along.

Thus Leona seems to have Henry whipped, with him playing the part of a titular VP bird in a gilded cage with no legitimate hope of escape. The accent is on legitimate. Henry's current predicament is revealed using a series of flashbacks via a string of telephone calls Leona takes part in one evening when she is all alone in her spacious mansion. In fact, the whole film takes place with Leona in her room on the phone, yet it is quite the thriller. One caller is from her past, Henry's old sweetheart; another is from her present, her personal physician; and finally there is a call from a mild-mannered chemist she doesn't know at all claiming to be Henry's partner in a criminal venture. Each caller fills in a piece of a puzzle that altogether paints a very unflattering picture of Henry, his extra-legal activities, his probable  intentions, and Leona's own part in driving Henry to all of this. Particularly chilling is Leona's call to the Bowery 2-1000 number given to her by the chemist who is Henry's accomplice that has called earlier in the evening. She attempts to leave a message, but it is a place where no messages are ever given - the city morgue.

This is a very entertaining film noir with an engrossing and suspenseful plot featuring some excellent acting performances from veteran Barbara Stanwyck and a young Burt Lancaster. It is unusual in the sense that the film's murder mystery is solved - including the victim's identity and the motive for the crime - before the murder actually takes place. I haven't found any boxed sets that include this film, and there are several excellent ones that specifically feature the film noir genre.

1180100,5,B000003KE0,"Despite the fact the film came out in 1948, it still holds up and even exceeds many of today's so-called thrillers in terms of storytelling and suspense.

There are a few things about this thriller that sets it apart from the rest. One is that it's believeable. Second, her process of investigation, trying to track her husband while also trying to get someone to do something about the murder plot is simply use of common sense instead of these extremely complicated ways of discovering plot points in the majority of today's films. She's an invalid and faced with that dilemma, they successfully distract us from the time as each call takes us back, giving an understanding of why she'll be murdered at 11:15.

By the time this film reaches its climax, we understand the pain and frustration of each of these characters, who are both the cause of the horrible event about to take place.

The climax would have failed had we not been set up properly. Without an understanding of both points of view, that ending never would have paid off because you wouldn't have believed in their remorse in the end.

By the time they realize the mistakes they've made, it's too late to right them and this little treasure of a film delivers one of best last lines ever in a movie. And who could forget Bowery 2-1000?

With so many films remade today including ""The Haunting,"" ""House of Wax"" and ""House on Haunted Hill,"" you wonder why somebody hasn't attempted to update this story.

It is based on a radio drama of the same title that was basically a monologue.  It is about an woman who is confined to her bed.  While calling her husband, the operator dials the wrong number and she hears two men planning her murder.

Sorry, Wrong Number takes the plot of the radio drama even further by layering it with backstory.  Frankly, the plot is pretty much the same as the radio drama (which is probably because the screenplay was written by the same person that did the radio drama) only there is just so much more depth to the movie.

This movie almost seems like it was done by Hitchcock because of the firm reliance on the visual.  The cinematography was brilliant-many shots are taken in continuous, beautiful movements.  The shots are well done, as is the movie.

The only detracting point is the ending; I was expecting something better.  What happened in the ending was similar to what Hitchcock regretted doing in Sabotage-the suspense is built up to a furious level then disappointingly squashed.

Barbara Stanwyck is a rich, arrogant, manipulative invalid.  Any attempt to make her sympathetic is blown away by the revelation she's not even an invalid but that comes later.

Stanwyck's creepy character marries Burt Lancaster.  Burt's no prize either and marries for money.  In short, he's a creep.  Babs and Burt live with Stanwyck's wealthy, arrogant father (a creep).

Having had enough, Burt conspires with a coworker to steal from Stanwyck's father's company.  He finds an accomplice who is very easily persuaded, a creep.  The two men hookup with a mobster.  Burt gets in trouble with the mob guy (who's a creep, BTW) and plans to 86 the misses for her money.

1180149,4,B000003KE0,"This review is for the 2002 release Paramount DVD.

'Sorry, Wrong Number' opens in a New York apartment with Leona Stevenson (Barbara Stanwyck), an immobile, bedridden wife trying to contact her husband Henry Stevenson (Burt Lancaster) by phone at his office but is accidentally connected to another line where she overhears two men plotting to kill someone later that night.  She hears the specific details of how the murder will be done, but does not know who will be victim.  It appears the call can't be traced and the details are too nebulous for the police to take action.  So again, Leona tries to contact Henry and since he can't be found, she does some detective work by phone and learns an amazing amount about her husband over the phone for the remainder of the day.

Some very detailed flashbacks reveal the troubled relationship Leona and Henry.  First, Leona is the heiress of a huge pharmaceutical business and she met Harry while in college although Henry didn't even finish high school and was working in a drug store.  In spite of this odd relationship, they eventually get married but Leona immediately takes complete control of the relationship and Henry obviously feels trapped, emasculated and in deep need of proving his self worth even though he's been given an unchallenging job as a vice president for Leona's father's drug company.  This sets up the rest of the movie where Leona learns a lot about Henry through various phone conversations and none of what she finds out is good and it builds up to a climatic ending.

The picture is unmistakably film noir and has plenty of convincing actors, especially Stanwyck, and has a very mysterious plot to hold the viewer's interest.  I only have two critical comments about this film.  One problem is there are several extreme coincidences that are put in place to make the movie work.  The most obvious event that borders on the totally improbable is hearing this extremely relevant phone call by accident in a city as large as New York and to a slightly lesser degree receiving several extremely informative tips from various willing phone callers over the course of several hours.  But the bigger problem is the ending where someone realizes that a serious crime is about to occur and this person calls several parties for help but none of these people are the police.  It's an entertaining film and because of the acting and the noir look of the movie, I liked it, but I didn't love it.

The B&W DVD picture quality has virtually no signs of film deterioration, but was noticeably grainy.  Some scenes, especially the ones shot on a beach, were very grainy and had poor contrast.  The audio was good, but parts of the mysterious phone call were hard to hear.  The only bonus is a trailer.

1180150,5,B000003KE0,"The 1948 chiller ""Sorry, Wrong Number"" is a film I've seen many times, and will doubtlessly see many more. This stylish black-and-white thriller, which stars Barbara Stanwyck and Burt Lancaster, does a great job of building up to its chilling, ""hide-under-the-covers"" climax. It's impossible for me NOT to get the shivers every time I see that murderous shadow of the killer slowly ascending those stairs! A brilliant scene. The shadowy image of the murderer at the end of this film is one of the creepiest and most effective shots I've ever seen. Coupled with the film's grade-A music score, it makes that final act all the more bone-chilling.

William Conrad has a nice role here, too, playing a rather unsavory acquaintance of Lancaster's. And let's not forget Ed Begley, who is just fine as Miss Stanwyck's father.

""Sorry"" unfolds in a series of flashback scenes (in fact, there's even one scene that features a ""flashback within a flashback""). It never gets overly confusing however, with everything coming together nicely in the final act.

While Barbara Stanwyck is very good as the distressed main character (""Leona Cotterell-Stevenson""), I can't help but wonder what this film would have been like if Agnes Moorehead had starred in the part instead. Moorehead is famous for playing the role numerous times on radio.

This DVD-Video from Paramount Home Entertainment provides viewers with a darn-good video transfer of ""Sorry, Wrong Number"". The dark, shadow-filled ""noir""-like qualities that emanate from this film translate nicely to the TV screen via this disc. The picture isn't 100% pristine here, with some grain noise dancing around in some scenes -- but I think it looks very good overall. The video aspect ratio is the intended Full Frame (1.33:1); with the original Mono audio pleasantly replicated here (in Dolby Digital 2-Channel form).

The DVD sports a French Mono audio track, too. Plus English subtitles. The Theatrical Trailer is also included. The trailer is the only ""bonus"" on the disc, but it's a honey. With a run time of 2:44, the trailer is the good old-fashioned type, which has dramatic phrases flashed in large, imposing letters on the screen to draw viewers into the theater. Enticing them to see (per this film's trailer) ""The Most Electrifying Experience The Screen Has Ever Offered!"" -- Think that might be a wee bit of an overstatement here? Well, in any event, that's up to each movie-watcher to decide I suppose. What is ""electrifying"" to one person might be nothing more than a wet sparkler to another. ;)

A two-sided, one-page insert comes in the Keep Case for ""Sorry"", with a Chapter List on one side (11 chapter breaks).

Some of my favorite dialogue from ""Sorry, Wrong Number"":

>> Miss Stanwyck, after being asked over the telephone by the rather shady ""Waldo Evans"" to repeat back a multiplicity of instructions intended for her husband --- ""REPEAT IT BACK TO YOU!!  ARE YOU INSANE?!"" (The one hysterically-funny moment in the picture.)

>> ""Well, who is this? What number am I calling?!""  ....  ""Bowery 2, one-thousand, ma'am -- the city morgue.""

---------------

If you're looking for a really good mystery/suspense story, ""Sorry, Wrong Number"" is a can't-miss choice. Just watch out for that guy on your stairs!",1125792000,15,3266,5.0352504638218925
1180151,5,B000003KE0,"Barbara Stanwyck and Burt Lancaster were two of the most dynamic stars in Hollywood history and together they generated fireworks in ""Sorry, Wrong Number.""  Anatole Litvak directed this mystery classic along with ""Snake Pit"" and both were released in 1948.  Both ""Sorry, Wrong Number"" and ""Snake Pit"" deal with psychiatric problems, a major winner during the period following Alfred Hitchcock's success in ""Spellbound"" three years earlier.

Based on a radio drama, the film revolves around Stanwyck overhearing a party line conversation concerning what she soon realizes is a plan to murder her that evening.  The bed ridden woman then frantically pieces together all the information she can about the planned event.  She becomes overwhelmed when she realizes that Lancaster, who is conveniently away on business, is part of the mix.

A surprise that emerges during all the investigation, which involves convincingly applied flashbacks, is Stanwyck's physical condition.  She refers to herself as an invalid and lives the part, but Wendell Corey in the role of a doctor consulted by Lancaster reveals that Stanwyck's problems are psychological rather than physiological as her periodic ""attacks"" occur whenever her husband challenges the status quo.

The plight into which Stanwyck ultimately descends results from her strong-willed and spoiled manner as a young woman who sees Lancaster and plucks him from the arms of a woman from his own station in life who loves him.  Her father, played by Ed Begley, is a Chicago pharmaceutical giant who initially balks over her intention to marry a man from a poor family who has lived his entire life in a small town and is a high school dropout.  The unrelenting Stanwyck is used to getting her way and it proves to her ultimate disadvantage with Lancaster.

Some reviewers criticized the film by stating that Lancaster, a he man type, was miscast as someone who is pigeonholed by a rich woman and put in a showcase vice president's job working under her father with few responsibilities other than satisfying her.  They missed the point of recognizing that the film's dramatic tension springs from the conflict within Lancaster, who is too strong and independent to function as a ""toy boy"" for a spoiled rich woman.  Eventually he tells her, ""I've learned to like this life but on my own terms.""  Stanwyck is then confronted with a monster of her own creation.

When Lancaster turns against Stanwyck it is with a vengeance as he convinces a chemist to unite with him to make money by siphoning off some of the company's drug supply and selling it to the mob for a huge profit.  William Conrad plays the part of the mob boss with stern conviction.

The clock ultimately winds down for Lancaster as well as Stanwyck as they both become enmeshed in complicated mob machinations.",1106006400,35,2819,5.027956989247312
1180152,5,B000003KE0,"In ""Sorry, Wrong Number"", Barbara Stanwyck turns in one of the many memorable performances that made her the Queen of Noir. Leona (Barbara Stanwyck) is the spoiled daughter of a pharmaceutical magnate, now a demanding invalid wife to Henry Stevenson (Burt Lancaster), who must live every moment to please her. One evening she overhears a telephone conversation between two men plotting a murder. Unnerved by the call, alone in her vast apartment, and increasingly worried when her husband doesn't come home from work, Leona uses the only means she has to communicate with the outside world: the telephone. She calls everyone she can think of to find her husband, but what she learns only makes her more anxious as to his fate and her own.

""Sorry, Wrong Number"" is based on a popular radio play by Lucille Fletcher, who also wrote a novel based on the play and the screenplay for this film. Leona's confinement to her apartment, where her only means of figuring out what is going on is a telephone, is one of the most effective uses of isolation in cinematic history. Leona isn't a sympathetic character. But her physical and emotional isolation is so palpable that it's unnerving. She can't control what's happening to her. Her insular, dependent lifestyle has left her paranoid. So it's hard to say if anything is happening to her at all. Is paranoia with justification still paranoia? And who were the mysterious men on the phone talking about? Where is her husband? The fact that the audience doesn't know the answers to those questions any more than Leona does makes ""Sorry, Wrong Number"" a top-notch thriller and a masterpiece of empathy in the service of suspense.

The DVD: The only bonus feature is a theatrical trailer. Subtitles are available in English. Dubbing is available in French.",1093910400,55,1797,4.907894736842105
1180153,4,B000003KE0,"The title is dialogue spoken at the diabolical finish to this classic and famous film noir based on the radio play of the same name.  It stars Barbara Stanwyck as Leona Stevenson, a rich invalid who overhears a telephone conversation between two men who are plotting the murder of an unidentified woman.  Alone, from her sickbed she desperately tries to find somebody who will listen to her story and stop the murder from happening.  Burt Lancaster co-stars as Henry Stevenson, Leona's handsome husband from the wrong side of the tracks.

Stanwyck's performance is excellent, although according to what I understand (not having heard the radio play), she is not as good as Agnes Moorehead was in the original.  Be that as it may, Stanwyck grows in the part until as the story ends she is totally authentic and believable.

Lancaster too does a good job in one of his earlier roles.  He went on to star in scores of important films, perhaps most notably in From Here to Eternity (1953) and Elmer Gantry (1960).  Here he is a bit tentative, his enormous screen charisma held in check playing a compromised character.

The screenplay by Lucile Fletcher, based on her radio play, was expanded for the silver screen and consequently the story loses a bit dramatically as the tension is diffused as the end is delayed.  Fletcher uses flashbacks to fill us in on the story of how Henry and Leona met and how the murder plot developed and why.

I thought director Anatole Litvak did a good job with the flashbacks, but frankly their artificiality was noticeable.  I would have preferred starting the story at the beginning when Leona and Henry first meet and then telling it chronologically without flashback.  But that would have been a great departure from the structure of the very successful radio play.

Because of the added material, the movie becomes something more than the original intention.  Indeed the theme is expanded, that of the possible consequences of marrying for money, and the consequences--from Leona's point of view--of marrying someone who may or may not love you.  I thought this was well done.  It is especially interesting to see how trapped Henry feels working for his father-in-law and even living in his father-in-law's house.  Also interesting is how Leona's insecurities regarding Henry's love are manifested in psychosomatic symptoms.

When Hollywood once again reprises this (and you can be sure they will, but perhaps they will use email and not the telephone) I suggest that they concentrate on both the dramatic and psychological aspects of the story and tell it straight.

Bottom line: Despite some awkwardness and dissipation of tension, this is one of the best film noirs from that classic era of the genre, the late forties and early fifties.  See this for Barbara Stanwyck, one of Hollywood's celebrated stars whose career spanned half a century beginning in the silent film era.",1090800000,10,2913,4.9526748971193415
1180154,5,B000003KE0,"I'll never forget the first time I saw this movie. The quality I was most struck by was it's darkness. I was very young & didn't realise at the time that I was watching one of the best examples in the history of cinema of film noir(nightmare noir even).Darkness, darkness...even the scenes set during the day feel dark. Many of my fellow film lovers have already provided a synopsis so I won't bother you with yet another. Suffice to say this a superbly acted thriller with beautiful elements of melodrama & a knockout climax. I've seen Barbra Stanwyck & Burt Lancaster in SO many films, but this is the one I keep coming back to. Feel the darkness, enjoy the rain, live the nightmare...",1089417600,99,687,4.548387096774194

Anyway, I do love the movie and Barbara's performance (isn't hard to believe she never won an Oscar other than the Honorary Award she was given in March '82?).  I intend to buy the DVD soon!",1062720000,5,519,4.7444444444444445
1180177,4,B000003KE0,"Barbara Stanwyck never gave a bad performance.  Even when her material was second-rate, the lady herself was always first class.  Such is the case with ""Sorry, Wrong Number"", the story of a woman terrorized by what she accidently hears over a telephone.  In adapting and expanding her tightly-written and suspenseful radio play for the screen, author Lucille Fletcher manufactured a complicated series of flashbacks (and flashbacks within flashbacks!) intended to provide the audience with some background into the Stanwyck character's crisis.  Unfortunately, the added scenes, which primarily focus on some uninteresting secondary characters, only served to interrupt and thus dilute the effectiveness of Stanwyck's magnificent portrayal of a selfish socialite slowly descending into a state of frenzied hysteria and unbridled fear.
According to legend, director Anatole Litvak gave Stanwyck the option of shooting her demanding emotional scenes with the telephone in segments spaced throughout the production schedule, or filming them all at once and in sequence.  Stanwyck, ever the perfectionist, chose the latter course and spent almost two weeks on the climactic bedroom set, each morning having to work herself back into the state of terror and anxiety in which she had ended the prior day's scenes.  Stanwyck always maintained that her hair started to gray during this time period, and sure enough!, alert viewers will note that tiny wisps of silver begin to show up in the actress' hair by the end of the movie.  Stanwyck's consummate professionalism ultimately paid off handsomely; despite the weakness of the screenplay adaptation, her characterization is among her best, and she received her fourth Oscar nomination as Best Actress in a Leading Role for her amazingly raw and gritty performance.
The DVD presentation of this nail-biter is adequate at best.  The original film elements are splendidly well-preserved, as anyone who has seen the movie on cable TV or VHS cassette can attest.  But at the beginning of the DVD, a stray hair shows up at the bottom of the screen, goes away, and then reappears thoughout the credits.  This is inexcusable in this day and age of digital restoration; the film deserves a cleaner, crisper transfer.  The only extra feature is the film's Original Theatrical Trailer, which apparently was taken from a British source, since it carries an ""Unsuitable for Children"" warning.  Despite its flaws, the DVD presentation is still worth a look, if only to see the supremely talented Stanwyck at the top of her game.",1059782400,2,2557,5.301980198019802
1180178,3,B000003KE0,"Even at eighty-some minutes, this feels a little drawn out and in need of tightening up. But, ultimately, this nicely-shot film noir has to be credited with delivering the goods, particularly due to a memorable ending that these days wouldn't have made it past the first draft, especially if a big-name starlet played the central character. There aren't many extras on the DVD, but the sharp, clean print is a pleasure to behold.",1039996800,,429,4.890410958904109
1180179,5,B000003KE0,"A powerhouse performance by Barbara Stanwyck carries this film noir suspense thriller straight to the end. She plays Leona, a spoiled pharmaceutical heiress who's bedridden due to a hypochondriatic ""heart condition"". Pampered by her widowed father, she's always gotten everthing she wanted by manipulating her illness to her benefit. She's married to a younger man who's poor but given a good job by her father in his company to keep Leona happy. One night, when she is left alone in her shadowy house, she accidentally overhears a murder being plotted on the phone (her access to the world) and then later discovers it's her own murder being discussed. Frantically, she tries to get help and begins piecing together the events leading up to this moment through flashbacks. Stanwyck is awesome in a performance demanding neurotic hysteria as a hypochondriac who has alienated everyone including her husband and father with her demands and behavior. She should have gotten the Oscar she was nominated for. Burt Lancaster plays the hapless husband who is driven to extreme means to achieve success on his own terms but winds up in over his head and lives to regret it. This was originally a radio thriller by Lucille Fletcher (who also did the film's screenplay) with Agnes Moorehead as Leona. The story is well transposed to the screen and is a nailbiter. The ending is surprising for the time and must have been a shocker in 1948. Under the superb direction of Anatole Litvak, Stanwyck pulls out all the stops as a woman who cried wolf once too often. A real treat on DVD as it looks and sounds fine and a great collectors' item for Stanwyck fans as well.",1036022400,4,1655,4.830985915492958
1180180,5,B000003KE0,"The first time I saw ""Sorry, Wrong Number"" was as a teenager on a Friday night during a late show airing.  It made me a Barbara Stanwyck fan for life and I shall always consider her the greatest actress of that golden era.  She could do anything....in drama or comedy she was equally adept...something Bette Davis was NOT and she was never mannered like Katharine Hepburn.  Sorry, Wrong Number is effective film noir at its best.  Knowing the inevitable outcome at the end of the picture only makes one root for the character of Leona Stevenson even more!  Stanwyck should have won the Academy Award for this performace as she should have for all her other nominations as well.  This movie still packs a wallop and when they remade it as a 'cable' movie with Loni Anderson in the early 1990's one only had to watch the original to realize what a mistake they made!  This is a film to watch with the lights off.....and if you wonder why Stanwyck is revered as a great actress, this film will show you why!",1024099200,3,1004,4.483516483516484

First off, the radio version is great. I am priveledged to own a copy of it. Agnes Moorehead (Mrs. Snow from Pollyana) did a wonderful job, and you can take it as far as your imagination allows. But the Film version is so much better. You get a thriller that stands on its own two feet, and a plot that goes deeper than an open grave. Suspense is built with every trick in the book, until it's in your face at the climax. It starts eerily when Stanwyck overhears the plotting of a murder on the phone extension, down to the time when train will be rolling by to muffle the screams. She gets worked up pretty quickly, then after picking apart the details out in her mind, realizes that it is indeed her that will be victim! On top of that she is both alone and bed stricken. She cant walk, so her only possible salvation lies in the connection beside her. But the journey between the lines (Pun intended) is long, horrifying, and blurred. Finding out you are going to be murdered is bad enough, but when you realize who is envolved and why...there is the real terror.",992563200,,1206,4.317180616740088
1180183,3,B000003KE0,"In SORRY, WRONG NUMBER, Barbara Stanwyck gives a forceful (if not particularly subtle) performance as an invalid who accidentally overhears a phone conversation between two men plotting a murder--and eventually  realizes that she is the intended victim.
It's a great, potentially  suspenseful premise, but rather than build on it, the film goes back in  time to unravel the unnecessarily long and convoluted events that provide  the motive for the murder.  This is done by having Stanwyck telephone a  number of different characters, all of whom then proceed to recap the plot  through flashbacks (and flashbacks-within-flashbacks).  The dialogue sounds  false and scripted; you can tell this used to be a radio play (Burt  Lancaster in particular gets the worst lines).  No, it's not enough for a  woman to tell Stanwyck about a house on a beach; she has to go into detail  and expound upon the exact position of the house with relation to the  shoreline and the dock nearby, and also the weather and the number of  seagulls and whatever nautical details come to mind.  Add to that the fact  that Barbara Stanwyck's character has got to be one of the stupidest  would-be murder victims ever; here's this lady who knows a man is coming to  kill her, and all she does is call people and ask questions like, ""Oh, who  is so-and-so?""  How unrealistic.
The film is engrossing and entertaining  enough, but it's also incredibly frustrating.  Because there is so little  suspense invested in the story, it plays like a muddled soap opera.  A  thriller should be taut, not turgid.  When there is suspense, it comes in  tiny bolts, and the film undercuts the tension rather than allowing it to  build and build.  Yes, the climax is somewhat creepy, but it's very  unsatisfying--not even Stanwyck's impressive screaming talents are enough  to provide a good pay-off.  As the closing credits played, I just sat there  shaking my head in disbelief, thinking to myself that Alfred Hitchcock (who  made a far better invalid-who-suspects-foul-play thriller called REAR  WINDOW) might have had a field day with this one.",961891200,5,2105,5.0
