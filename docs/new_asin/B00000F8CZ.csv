7907769,4,B00000F8CZ,"I am somewhat of a new sailor on bigger boats. I found the content of the video to be very good. I did fall asleep through part of it.. they could make it a bit more enguaging.  So the answer is .. and I have heard this time and time again.. If your even thinkning about reefing.. 'REEF IT'.. use a storm jib.  I would say make sure you have a high volume pump on board.  They said, and I agree 100%, pratice your drills.",1389225600,,421,3.929411764705882
7907770,3,B00000F8CZ,I found the information on sailing a boat in heavier winds worth seeing. Info on sail construction and choice was good. But when it came to actual handling of the boat when winds were over gale force it seems this video was a bit wishy washy. I think the Storm Tactics DVD the Pardeys put together is much more confidence building. I may be prejudiced because I attended some of their seminars and they understand the problems that face those of us who sail short handed.,1197936000,3,471,4.488372093023256
7907771,5,B00000F8CZ,"This is a very fine film. There are more than 15 veterans of famous ocean races from around the world interviewed between segments of footage from ""on board offshore"" in seas ranging from 12-20 feet, with all the important major  points covered. There are some short bits of footage from round the world races from bigger seas as well. The emphasis here is on newer sleeker fin keel designs from the last 20 years though even the owner of an older sailboat w/o much on board heavy sea experience should find the review helpfull. The production itself is First Class!",1117584000,,566,4.66
