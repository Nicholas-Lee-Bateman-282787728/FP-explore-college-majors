We recommend this video because it's even intestesting for adults, which is great when he wants us to watch it with him. The ""Farm Country"" part is the best of the three  in our opinion.

Big Machines 2 is already purchased and stashed away to be a birthday gift when he turns three. We are looking forward to seeing it.",1092009600,5,411,4.394736842105263
1827166,5,B0000844KO,"I bought this for my 2 year old Grandson (whom I babysit) and he watches it everyday.  He has favorite parts of each one, the cow poop scene on ""The Farm Tractors"" selection, blowing up the rocks on ""Building a House"", and scraping up the pavement on ""Building a Road"".  Each day it's something different, depending on his mood, but we always watch the ""tractor show"".  It is educational, I learned alot (and I have a college degree)! I think it would be too boring without the music and he loves the guys and imitates their waves. He knows Rusty's and George's waves and will ask you how they wave....you'd better get them right! I would highly recommend this DVD. Believe it or not, it is very calming, and keeps their attention for a long time.  A good thing to put on while you are trying to make supper.",1087603200,8,808,4.402684563758389
1827167,5,B0000844KO,"My son has watched this dvd EVERY DAY since Christmas and is absolutely mesmerized. I even learned a few things about home construction and farm life, the first half-dozen times I watched it with him. He points out the same vehicles/tractors when we see them on the road and plays w/ his tonka trucks on the floor while watching. Not sure what we'd do without this. Planning to buy volume 2!",1074211200,4,391,4.52112676056338
1827168,5,B0000844KO,I ended up scouring the Internet and video shops for the last 6 months trying to find a DVD with construction equipment for my 3 year old son.  Finally a DVD that is educational and fun.  It has all the elements that my son likes.... heavy equipment!!!! A must for boys.,1051228800,4,270,4.2745098039215685
7979016,5,B0000844KO,"I am a Fred Levine junkie and I still have an old original VHS copy of ""Road Construction Ahead"" from 1991 and I am very happy that this DVD has adventures that I didn't see until I got older. I got ""The Biggest Machines In The World"" from my Mom and I enjoy that as well. I really enjoy Fred Levine's work. Well done! A super huge 10 out of 10. Since this is so good, I wish I could give it ten stars!",1388275200,,402,3.7976190476190474

7979019,1,B0000844KO,I was charged for this item and it was never sent. I emailed the seller to no avail. I had to file a complaint to get the seller to respond and allow me to recover my money.  A full month passed before I could process the complaint as the delivery time was so broad that I had to wait a month. I would have liked an email just indicating that the item was no longer available so I didn't have to wait a month to purchase another one. I was not happy with this transaction.,1223251200,,472,3.968421052631579

7979021,5,B0000844KO,"We rented this from our local library and now I want a copy!  This video is really 3-in-one.

1. Road Construction Ahead
2. House Construction Ahead
3. Farm Country Ahead

Chock full of big machines, this video is mostly visual with background music and some explanatory commentary, my two-year-old loves it.  The Road Construction shows how roads are built showing front loaders, excavators, dump trucks, graders, rollers, line painters, rock crushers, asphalt mixers, the works!  The House Construction shows how houses are built and where the materials come from, including how concrete is made at the concrete plant and how trees are harvested and milled. The Farm Country shows where our food comes from and how it gets from the farm to the container you buy in the grocery store.  Check out littlehardhats.com

I might have learned more than my son!",1201824000,,855,5.0212765957446805
7979022,5,B0000844KO,"THis video is amazing. It is entertaining, educational, intelligent, and humorous. My 2.4 yr old toddler asks for it from the minute he wakes up til he goes to sleep. He can watch 3 straight shows of it! Not that we do that often, but it's so interesting, well made, and educational, we sometimes allow it.

Grown men come over and can't leave it is so fascinating.

well worth the $.",1135987200,2,384,4.394366197183099
7979023,5,B0000844KO,"We borrowed Big Machines 1 from our local library, and our 21-month-old loves to watch this -- so much, in fact, that we had to renew it 3 times!

He loves the 'diggers' and the house construction... we're currently remodeling our home, and every time he sees hammers, he says ""Daddy? Bang bang!"" We have 'discussions' about the diggers, and he loves to tell us what they're doing. He's a little young to appreciate the 'cow humor.'

7979024,5,B0000844KO,"I can't wait to get this DVD - heard fantastic things about it - be beware.  Amazon is advertising that this is available in 2 - 4 weeks.  hmmmm . . .well I ordered mine on November 18, 2004 and haven't received it yet.  They do apologize about once a month but I would rather they'd been accurate from the start.",1107648000,2,313,4.098360655737705
7979025,5,B0000844KO,"We don't own this movie, but I randomly rented it a couple months back...  And we ended up re-renting it for four consecutive weeks.  Our 5- and 2- year old boys would watch it every day (and I loved it too).  My favorite part was the 30 second plus explosion sequence in the rock quarry...  The boys would laugh themselve silly watching the cows chew.

Though I couldn't sit there thru the whole movie, I enjoyed all the parts I did see, and the boys would happily watch the whole thing, over and over and over.",1097712000,6,512,4.291666666666667
