8416442,5,B00450HLDK,"I accidentally found ""Say Amen Sombody"", discovered the Barrett Sisters and was completely blown away.  I've had a love affair with them (musically) since.  I follow them on Youtube and watch over and over when I need to hear beautiful and religious next to operatically sincere singing.  I'm moved beyond belief each time I hear their  melodious voices.  It is extremely rewarding musically and spiritually hearing them sing.  I have no regrets with this purchase and though their voices are failing is a treat to hear.

I'm a true fan and forever will be!!!",1331769600,2,559,4.882978723404255
8416443,4,B00450HLDK,"I was on a jazz cruise with Oscar Peterson, Milt Jackson and Joe Williams a few years back and the Barrett Sisters were scheduled to sing the afternoon we pulled out of port. They were so good that the ship cleared their showcase Wednesday night musical to dedicate the entire show to two evening performances by the Barretts for the entire ship. They tore down the house (or ship) and were the talk of the cruise.
By this video. They are understandibly older now but still have that magic.",1311811200,2,490,4.51685393258427
