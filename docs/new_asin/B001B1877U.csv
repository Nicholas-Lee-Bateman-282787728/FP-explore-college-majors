3478233,3,B001B1877U,"I usually enjoy anything the Lionsgate name appears on , but I didn't realize this was a Lionsgate flick until I rented it.  It was entertaining enough with an unusual style.  I thought the acting was transparent in some spots, and the music, suitable at first,  tended to get annoying later.  But this movie has a very strange feel; that's what kept me glued to it.

I don't want to reveal anything, but you'll probably start to work it out fairly early in the film, because this ""twist"" has been twisted before.

Still a good one, though.  Once again, Lionsgate does not disappoint.",1220745600,11,584,4.611650485436893
8280957,2,B001B1877U,very  poor transfer even poorer  movie. I love b- horror movies and have over 1000 in my collection  but even I thought this was a waste of disc space,1474588800,,150,4.103448275862069
8280958,4,B001B1877U,it always scares me  to see yourself dead but this did not  it was ok to much chasing each other,1427500800,,96,3.75
8280959,4,B001B1877U,"For those who are expecting a Friday the 13th, or a Halloween type flick stay away. This is nothing like that. This is a very cool film. Very very weird and offbeat. It becomes super eerie and quite disturbing in the last half hour like a bad dream coming to life you can't wake up from. It disturbed me. The thought the lead actress was great too.  It is not for the slasher movie lover, but it is still it delivers.",1402704000,,417,4.148148148148148
8280960,5,B001B1877U,I don't know why everyone is so negative about this movie.  I loved it and I cannot wait to purchase my own copy.,1279929600,,113,3.9130434782608696
8280961,3,B001B1877U,"You will probably know the story from the start and figure it out,but that's not to say it's a horrible movie,I liked the end. I thought it would end like everyone else thought,and to an extent I was right but the end was the most eerie of all. A decent flick.",1279324800,,260,4.117647058823529
8280962,1,B001B1877U,"My girlfriend and I just watched this last night. This has got to be the WORST horror movie I've ever seen (it makes Halloween 2--the Zombie remake--look awesome by comparison). Horrible acting, stupid plot and too many times you have to ask why are they doing this. Bad, bad, bad. I'm sick of horror movies. Most aren't that scary. Even the ones with a lot of gore don't interest me. This one didn't have any gore at all. Stay away from this one!",1272758400,,447,4.397590361445783
8280963,1,B001B1877U,"...so, so bad.  I love scary movies, thrillers, etc.  This was boring and pretty awful (the acting was like torture to watch).  [...]",1248134400,,133,4.695652173913044
8280964,3,B001B1877U,"The jacket on this DVD advertises an astonishing twist ending. You'll probably guess that ending from the start though. The cinematic tricks and quick replays make it fairly obvious. However, there is a slightly different take on that obvious ending that's revealed in the movie's very last sentence voice-over.

On the negative side, the actors are mostly unknowns and in some instances, rightly so. The sets and production values show Morgue's amateur roots, and the narrative involves some contradictory muddle in the Morgue.

On the plus side, while there is no full-length Directors' commentary on the DVD, there is a ""Making of Morgue"" featurette that shows a little of the interesting interaction between the Portuguese Directors and the American/Canadian cast and crew.

Overall, this movie is worth sticking with, although it's a marginal call. But it might leave you, at least temporarily, with a greater appreciation for what you have. And that's more than most quick indie movies accomplish.",1231632000,3,1003,5.29559748427673
8280965,1,B001B1877U,"Wow, this was the worst film I have every seen.

1. You figured out the ""twist"" in the opening sequence.
2. The acting is horrible. The little girl was the best one.
3. WHY THE H3LL WOULD A PARENT LEAVE THEIR CHILD WITH A STRANGER THEY JUST MET!!
4. The pace of each scene was excruciating.
5. When you have to get help... don't you normally run... not stroll through a graveyard?",1225670400,5,380,4.277777777777778
8280966,2,B001B1877U,"Take five seemingly unrelated people, put them meeting at a Morgue, have them chased by someone with a scalpel, then chop the film to pieces & reconnect the parts any way you see fit, and that's The Morgue. Very low budget, and without giving too much away, if you needed a movie that's a poor-mans cross between The Sixth Sense and The Others, go rent this for free from Redbox like I did. Wish I didn't though...Jeez, Lionsgate really has been putting out the lamest flix lately....
