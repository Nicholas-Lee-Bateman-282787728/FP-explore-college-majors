945556,5,6304980310,"This is an excellent movie.  I always enjoyed the differing versions of hte thief of bag dad.  This one in particualr has Roddy McDowell in it which makes it alot more fun for me.  I always felt in all his movies he always did a wonderful acting job.  Heck even when he did the planet of the Apes things, he brought nuances to the characters he played that made the otherwise silly shows more enjoyable.

I shouldnt digress about one actor and get to this film.

Packagaing is a single dvd in a case.  It came fairly fast and in good condition.  Actual film and sound quality was excellent.  This particualr Thief of Bag Dad version has a few changes from the 1938 version with sabu.  In this one Roddy Mcdwoell is the Thief and Not Sabu.  They have a fun time filming htis one, and on purpose the small beard that Roddy wears actualy shifts and moves(becasue its fake of course)  Where the storys change majorly which I always remeber, is the part where they go to get the all seeing eye.  IN the 1938 version they are sent to a temple with a giant statue and must progress through traps.  In this version they must go through a mystic cavern area...where they are confronted with the challenge to simply stay on the path....which of course has al sorts fo things happening out side the path to trick them.  Which brings onthe best part with Roddy Mc Dowell going down the path...and the voices calling to him telling him so many nasty things and all he does is pause and say ""Too True"".

Anywise I don't want to spoil this one...but i will say the acting is good, and the effects are wonderful. IN 1978 there was a push for a lot of cheesy special effects and campy things happening.  This one doesnt spoil the film with things like that.",1362787200,,1740,4.370716510903427
945557,1,6304980310,"The transfer of this movie is poor and I have to say very disappointing.  Transfer quality is similar to a poor VHS copy to DVD ... fuzzy and difficult to watch.

The movie itself is a typical Arabian nights theme.  I was surprised to find so many top stars in this production that it was nice to see.  One of my favorite bad guys is Terrence Stamp who again shows why he does such a great job.  The story is very similar to the original 1940's Thief of Baghad in plot.  Personally, the 1940's version is much better and would recommend that.  I would have enjoyed the movie more if the transfer had been decent.  That being said, I would rate the movie with 3 stars ....

Transfer should be 0 stars but 1 is all you can give it.",1358208000,4,729,4.15
945558,3,6304980310,"I love this movie, I was so happy that I found it being sold through Amazon, instead of a shady third-party dealer. Unfortunately, the DVD looks like it was homemade. It's on a 4.7 GB DVD, so the movie was burned onto it unprofessionally. I really don't understand the back of the box, saying that unauthorized reproduction is a violation, as this is obviously an unauthorized reproduction, a cheap one at that.
I'm glad I have the movie, but I'm really disappointed that it wasn't DVD quality. I should have just gone with the VHS for better quality. Disappointed that Amazon would directly sell such a badly made product.",1357171200,6,623,4.724770642201835
945559,5,6304980310,"""The Thief Of Baghdad"" is a 1924 novel by Achmed Abdullah, and has been transformed into several adapted versions of epic films starring a wide range of well-knowns such as Douglas Fairbanks (1924), Steve Reeves (1961), Conrad Veidt (1940), and others, even an animated version or two, and the films range anywhere from 1924 to an endless future of remakes, and is even available as a board game.  THIS particular DVD version here on Amazon dot com stars Roddy McDowall in the title role, along with Marina Sirtis of Star Trek TNG notoriety (as a harem girl), Peter Ustinov as the Caliph, Ian Holm (as the gate keeper at the Mountain of Truth), Terence Stamp as Wazir Jaudur (the evil wizard), and Pavla Ustinov as Princess Yasmine (in real life she is the elder daughter of Peter Ustinov).
This 1978 version was a TV movie (PG or maybe even just G rated), intended to be a romance / comedy / drama / adventure / sci-fi  / fantasy thrown into a blender and the frappe button pushed, and then poured out this film about a resourceful thief who helps a handsome prince win the beautiful princess in marriage.  There are Arabian themes and architecture depicted, and some of the film takes place in the palace of a Caliph.  Of course this production has been unrecognizably Americanized to be palatable for the viewing public of the United States, and has little if any basis in reality - past, present, or future.  It's just a movie.
** SPOILER  ALERT **
The memorable part that haunted me since I first saw this in 1978 was when the prince enters the Mountain of Truth, seeking the ""all-seeing-eye"" and because he is sidetracked by an illusion, he is turned to stone.  Therefore the resourceful thief (Roddy McDowall) enters the Mountain of Truth, risking all, to rescue the prince by redeeming him when he succeeds in his own quest to take the ""all-seeing-eye"" into his own possession and together with the rescued prince continue on their adventure to return to the palace of the Caliph, with many eerie, other-worldly interruptions along the way.  The Mountain of Truth has tormentors who shout accusations of derision and blasphemy, there are illusions of many varieties, and the path is winding through a dense fog in subterranean ambience. (Tame by today's thriller or horror genre standards, but in 1978, convincing enough to bring on a bad dream or two.)
I'm not as impressionable now as I was in 1978, but I enjoyed seeing this old classic film again, and FYI, this DVD has no frills.  No subtitles, no alternate languages, no extras, no gag reel, and yet, the picture quality is reproduced quite well, and the sound is very good.  Forget about the politics of the recent events in the Middle East, and let this entertainment take your mind beyond distraction into a place where magic and love coincide into the adventure of a lifetime. (DVD film length is one hour and forty minutes)",1338076800,7,2892,4.731610337972167

945561,3,6304980310,"This fantastic movie was shown on the big screen here during the 1980s.

 Many youngsters must have had their first dose of an alternate culture

other than the creole one prevalent!!

An entertainment which takes you on a magic carpet ride and encounters with airbourne horsemen!!

A STRONG FLAVOUR from the east; it brings a nostalgic appeal to our senses, reminding us

of another reality which must have been our own sometime in the remote past!!!The genie does it well, making many beggars ride a wishing horse!!!",1317513600,,518,4.896551724137931

Roddy McDowell is excellent, and Daniel Emilfork as the Genie....priceless.",1313366400,3,284,4.3584905660377355
945563,3,6304980310,"The 1978 version of The Thief of Baghdad is probably the best of the family of films under this title.  Unlike the Sabu (1940s) and Reeves (1960s) versions, this film takes a fairly serious attitude to the story. A made-for-television movie, this film has fairly good special effects for its era.  The flying carpet and genie scenes convey the excitement of the quest to find the All-seeing Eye and rescue the Princess Jasmine from the evil Vizier.  Roddy McDowell's rendition of the amiable thief/street magician, Hasan is pleasant relief without the slapstick found in earlier versions of the film.  The test of the Temple of Truth and the final scene in which Prince Taj smashes the Vizier's soul (found hidden in a giant egg) is a combination of The Arabian Nights and European folklore.  Great stuff!  I enjoyed watching this film as much now as I did back in 1978.",983318400,6,870,4.766666666666667

7880249,5,6304980310,"Ah, Ustinov in top form and showing his genius level of comedic brilliance.  There is an alternate animated cover out there that is a bit misleading in that the genie appears to be on the side of the hero.  No, he is not because he is also a villain out to kill the hero.  Now, I've discovered a lot of parallels between this movie and the '91 film of Aladdin.  Just bear with me.  The ""Jafar"" in this film doesn't need a staff to hypnotize the Kalif played by Ustinov.  By the way he is hypnotized so hard, he is made into a living statue.  ""Carpet"" which is later stolen by the thief was first used by the main villain.  Okay, ""Prince Ali"" and ""Aladdin"" ended up as two separate people but, the latter is killed early in the film so its up to the former to be the hero.  As for the thief, his counterpart would be ""Abu"" and given that the actor would play a major role in the Planet of the Apes series, it fits.  Just take this film and compare it to the Aladdin film from 1991 and I think you'd see some of the similarities there.  Its really a very great film.",1431475200,,1064,4.091787439613527
