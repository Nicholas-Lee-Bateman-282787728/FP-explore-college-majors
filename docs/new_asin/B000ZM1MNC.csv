8236022,2,B000ZM1MNC,"I am very disappointed with this 3 disc set.  Out of the nine movies, only 2 were worth watching, Night Of The Living Dead & The Last Man On Earth starring the late great Vincent Price.  I rate the other movies DDD. I haven't viewed the Making Of The Night Of The Living Dead yet.  It was all I could do to get through the others.",1333670400,,330,3.9696969696969697
