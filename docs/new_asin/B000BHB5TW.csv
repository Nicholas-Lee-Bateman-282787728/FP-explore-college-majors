8086733,1,B000BHB5TW,"The dvd was rated as ""like new"", but it is missing essential content. I appreciate Beth Shaw's workouts, so I'm very disappointed that this dvd is defective. I paid what I thought was a considerable amount.",1447286400,,206,4.75
8086734,5,B000BHB5TW,This gave me 30 minutes of yoga with some challenges and modifications.  I really like how basic it is with good body awareness points from Beth.,1395705600,,145,4.576923076923077
8086735,3,B000BHB5TW,"Quality was very good. Very good sound and condition. I have never done yoga and this dvd was recommended by a certified yoga instructor. Quite a chunk of change for such a short workout. For someone who doesn't know the positions, it moved along from move to move a bit fast for a rank beginner.",1362355200,,296,4.4
8086736,5,B000BHB5TW,"I have a number of Yoga workout DVD's but this is my favorite and one in which I have attained the most benefit.  It is Yoga and yet it provides a real workout for the muscles for strengthening and toning.  It seems to be slow and easy and yet I have seen my body change using this DVD.  Beth Shaw is superb in maintaining a nice pace and yet providing a workout that is beneficial--as well as (dare I say it) relaxing.  Don't get me wrong--I do feel the workout and the sweat.  And, she does offer ideas for more advanced positions.  I like this DVD and have decided to try another one ""YogaFit: Flex and Flow with Beth Shaw."" I think it is a good idea to have several DVD's that can be rotated --so I don't get bored AND I am trying other moves.",1243814400,15,747,4.082191780821918
