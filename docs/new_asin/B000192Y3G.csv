1980278,5,B000192Y3G,"I hope that this film gets released on dvd soon, as it is one of my favorites.  Let it be is special because it shows the Beatles in their most un-polished best, Paul teaching the rest of the band the chords to ""Maxwell's silver hammer"" is reason enough to get this movie, also you get to see the break-up of the best band that ever existed, but with all the fighting and snickering going on in the movie, there are times while they are jamming, that you can see that they truly loved each other, and in the deplorable conditions of that studio, they could still create magic.",1018569600,10,576,4.333333333333333
1980279,5,B000192Y3G,"The original Idea behind this film was to show the band all working and making music together. What we witnessed however was The Beatles coming apart at the seams and Paul McCartney's desperate, but fruitless, attempts to keep the stuffing from falling out! Those who watched this film on its first release were given a glimmer of hope at the time with the brilliant, now famous, impromptu Roof top performance. It was a cold drizzly day that welcomed the band to play together live again like no other band would play again. It was the end of decade, the end of an era and the end of the greatest Rock and Roll band the world had ever known. A poignant occasion is marked as one Member steps up to the microphone and says to a visible audience that only just out numbers the film crew and themselves.  ""I'd like to thank you all on behalf of the group and myself, and I hope we passed the audition"".Bring on the DVD.",1015632000,13,917,4.394117647058824

1980281,4,B000192Y3G,"Before pulling it together for ""Abbey Road"" later that year, The Beatles limped through sessions for ""Get Back"", which would finally be released as ""Let It Be"" in 1970 with a little help from Phil Spector.  John was more or less pleased with the end result - ""When I heard it I didn't puke"" - but Paul was said to have been horrified by the chorus of female voices on ""The Long and Winding Road"".  The recording sessions seem to be less than pleasurable; Paul lectures George on how to play guitar and George snaps back while John merely glares when Paul starts in on him.  Ringo sits off on the periphery during these tense moments.  It's not all sour apples, though.  There's some laughter and cheerful jamming in the studio, and the finale is the riveting concert on the roof of Apple that brings the town to a standstill.  Distribution of this film has been slim to none over the past twenty years, so let's hope for a DVD release soon!",1008288000,125,940,4.436046511627907

1980325,5,B000192Y3G,"This video has been a long time coming. It seems forever that I waited for it's availability. Netflix didn't have it. The final installment of the Beatles. If you are are a fan, then in addition to A Hard a Days Night, Help, and Yellow Submarine, this video is a must have.  Similar to A Hard Days Night, there is no plot, just viewing the band producing what ends up as Abby Road and Let It Be. The tension between members becomes apparent. The climax of the film and the part we all wait for is the impromptu concert on the rooftop of Apple Studios.  This is the most serious of all their films. Nothing humorous about it.  It's a documentary on the demise of arguably the best rock band ever (although Mick Jagger may beg to differ).",1400630400,,736,4.318840579710145

1980333,5,B000192Y3G,"I think this DVD is essential to any hardcore Beatles fan. It shows The Beatles rehearsing songs that were to become the Let It Be album . It could be tedious for the casual fan of the Beatles. It is bittersweet watching the great music being created and at the same time seeing the tension between band members, and ultimately we all know it led to the end of the Beatles. The performance that ends the film is the last time the Beatles performed in public as a band. This is the reason you should see this movie. It is a great document of the final days, good and bad. Beatles fans have been waiting on an official release of this movie for years. Since no one knows for certain if or when that will happen , this is a good quality version of the film. It definitely is of better quality than copies I have purchased from other sources in the past.",1388275200,3,850,4.220858895705521

There was quite a bit more trouble going on that led to the breakup-mainly Paul vs the other three on who should manage their business affairs and at what cost... They went on later that year to produce one of their best albums - Abbey Road.... So this movie was not the Beatles breaking up, They just didn't like being filmed while rehearsing, do you blame them? and they didn't like the studio that was used for most of it. The rooftop concert however speaks volumes of they're live performance abilities.

1980376,2,B000192Y3G,"The 2 stars is not for the movie itself which is a 4 or a five, but for this edition. I know that most Beatles fanatics a desparate for a copy of Let It Be but this will disappoint you. It is a low quality version that isn't even as good as the Beta videotape version. Simply, this is a grossly overpriced bootleg that I truthfully surprised that Amazon carries. The cover insert looks like it was run off an a desktop copier & there is no booklet. I was lucky enough to have made a copy off my Laserdisk before my player gave up the ghost. The copy is a far superior to this. If you have one of the older Magical Mystery Tour DVD & then got the official remastered Blu Ray/DVD set last year or so your looking at that degree of difference. Still it is a great film, a must have for any Beatlesfanatic & if this is the only way you can get it's better than nothing but they are BOUND to release this eventually. If you must buy look for the least expensive copy you can find or go to one of the many download sites & download it because you're going to want to replace it the second it ever becomes available. As far as the movie itself. It shows the Beatles as tired & pissed off at each other. If this movie had be done naturally rather than forced it probably would have been more accurate but the artificiality of the situation of the being like in a goldfish bowl just made a bad situation worse. The fact that they were able to pull off one of their most towering achievements, Abby Road, shortly after shows just how badly the situation of Let It Be affected them & their creative process. The fact that the songs were as good as they were is a testament to just how great they were. In some ways it almost would be better to look at this as rehearsals for Abbey Road. Despite the depressing parts of seeing them argue there are also parts of absolute joy. While not a film for everyone overall it is a celebration of the Beatles, warts & all, and as such is an important movie.",1376006400,,1985,4.158441558441559

1980447,4,B000192Y3G,"So, it is the year 2013. Almost every bit(or byte, if you like) of audio, written word, picture or photography, running film, memorabilia, and anything else to which the Beatles' name's applies has been released to the public and then released and then released and re re released again and again, each in a far superior quality or form.

In Pepperland, no stone is unturned-except one: the United Artist/CBS-FOX movie -""Let It Be""- remains tucked away, hidden with all other worldly treasures, probably in the warehouse that is seen at the end of Steven Spielberg's first installment of Indiana Jones!

It is hardly a secret that the Beatles themselves did not like 1)the idea of filming a ""live"" album, 2) the idea of working during union hours which were 9 AM to 5 PM, and 3) the finished product which showed the group in a rare state of disarray and emotional confusion.

So it is widely speculated, that Sir Paul, Ritchie (as he is referred to in the film) aka Ringo Starr, and the estates of George Harrison and John Lennon do not want the movie available for public consumption.

That is why an original the HS copy of the movie, which was released in 1980, is a very rare and expensive fine for most Mego collectors. Having said that I will talk about the movie. Obviously if you are this far in you are a Beatle maniac.

The movie starts out with a slow fade in shot of Mal Evans and another Beatle associate setting up the famous bass drumwith the Beatles drop T logo. They then walk away. The movie begins with a pan in to McCartney and company doing a few ditties. The movie is overall light hearted in nature. It shows the band in a somewhat jovial mode in the vast studio set up for them in Twickenham studios. We are quick to learn that Ringo Starr has been taking piano lessons as he sits with Paul playing a little up-tempo number. To which Paul and Ringo find much amusement. As the film progresses, you can see the daily grind of producing an album, along with making a miserable documentary. You can tell that Mr. McCartney is the only one who feels any energy or impetus to finish the project the vibe in the rooms are very low key.

There are several camera fade and from far away too tight shots right in the Beatles faces. There is an interesting spat or row captured between McCartney and Harrison, which is somewhat exaggerated, over Harrisons playing guitar during the song ""the two of us""- we are certain that any serious digressions or bad behavior was certainly edited from all the final cuts of this movie. It is fun to watch on several different levels and I will list them. First there is the ""Fly-On-the-Wall"" aspect we get by observing the lads at work.

Next we have the simple joy of observing the Beatles produce and make records. It shows us that we regular world musicians are not that different. Meaning that we sound crappy while we are producing or recording a record and playing little riffs while the drummer plays fills in the bass player thumps his base. These elements show that John Lennon was in fact correct when he said that ""we were just another rock 'n roll band that made it very very big ""....

Additionally, is the interesting aspect of watching the members in the group switch from their traditional instruments. We see such transitions as Paul's bass and John's Epiphone Casino guitar, and George on his Gretsch, where he switches to a Gibson SG or a Fender  Stratocaster and watch Ringo play the piano with some deal of proficiency, or watching John Lennon play an old Hofner lap steel with a butane lighter. And then we see George Harrison switch from his normal position as the lead guitarist to that of bass guitarist when he uses the Fender VI bass guitar. We also see Paul on drums, as he frequently did play drums on many of the Beatles tracks. And we see the interplay between the band during good times and tense moments.

We are also given privy to the presence of Yoko Ono and her constant vigil right beside John as if they were glued to the hip. All of these elements make for a very interesting collapse into the most undisputed commercially and critically successful artistic venture of the 20th century, if not ever perhaps. What could possibly surpass this group and its or in the future? It would take a hell of a show to do so.

The movie, which is filmed by a gentleman named Michael Lindsay Hogg, who had, incidentally, directed many of the Beatles short films a.k.a. videos, is somewhat misguided and meanders, but that was the nature of the project. We are also given an insight to the groups discussions over what the direction of the film and project might be. It is particularly joyful and entertaining to watch Paul and John play songs they had written as teenagers. You can see the joy in their faces as they play them for the cameras it makes for a nice warm feeling for a band that was in decay. Additionally we have the introduction of organist and keyboard player Billy Preston, who plays the great solo on the song ""Get back"" and ""Don't Bring Me Down."" Harrisons talent as a songwriter is prominently featured in this movie, as we see him performing songs that would later showup on solo albums and a few that would show up on the album Let it Be and some of his early solo records. Many of the songs seen rehearsed in the film were put on Abbey Road. It is especially interesting to watch Ringo work out the chord progression on his hit ""Octopus's Garden"" and watch him drift off into dreamland while the other band members are discussing song arrangements, venues, and other trivialities.

Although they are hard to find and expensive if you do find one, the only way to watch this old VHS tape is off of the original copy. You can probably take the copy to a local electronics store and have it transferred to DVD. If you buy any of the homemade copies the film will not sound well and the picture will become distorted and unclear at many times. As a Beatle fan from age 16, I had seen this years ago when VHS was the main format for movies. That would have been about 1996. Or maybe 1995. Regardless, this movie should be watched by Beatle fans or rock historians or anyone really thinks that we all are lucky to have witnessed perhaps the most important commercially, critically and culturally musical force in modern history and certainly in pop culture.

I would put this movie in the number two position, behind their first movie, titled ""A Hard Days Night"" and then this movie, thirdly I would put ""Help,"" and then lastly would go ""Yellow Submarine."" So dust off your VHS players, pop this one in, and step inside Abbey Road studio #2! Zach Pierce",1372809600,4,6650,4.531666666666666

1980449,5,B000192Y3G,"Let it Be is a difficult film to watch. The Beatles were once on top of the world. Young, cocky, truly appearing to be enjoying their success, by 1969 they were physically, mentally and spiritually burned out.

John was nursing a serious heroin habit. He only found satisfaction in the drug and in his new-found love interest, Yoko Ono. He seemed uninterested in making music, and as you watch him in this picture, when he is lucid, he is secretly waiting for the right moment to break away from the group.

George was disgruntled. Frustrated at not being allowed to display his talents in the group, he was harboring deep resentments at the main songwriters, Lennon and McCartney, for holding him back. That sullen look you see in George's face is genuine. The ""highlight"" of the film is the argument he had with Paul. The result of that argument was George leaving the group for a few days until the other band members begged him to return. By the time the film was being made George had a cache of songs, and as you watch this film, he was secretly thinking what he can do with these songs. Of course, these songs became his three-LP album, All Things Must Pass, which was released after the Beatles broke up.

Ringo is just Ringo, but he also left the band for a few days during the filming of this movie. The  distant look in his face is his attempt to distance himself from all the drama in the group.

And then we have Paul. He is the only member of the band happy to be a Beatle. In this film he is constantly trying to lift the spirits of his band mates, mostly without success. On the surface, he appears to be a total control freak. This might very well be the case. But the spirits of the other members were so down, it is difficult to tell what were the real dynamics.

The Grey Eminence, the Darth Vader of the group was Yoko Ono. She was not liked by most Beatle fans and despised by the other band members. This reviewer's memory when seeing this film for the first time in the theater was that someone in the audience emitted an audible hiss when the camera first panned on her face.

For the longest time this movie was not available on DVD. For good reason. The four people we see on the screen are not the happy-go-lucky youths running down a street, chased by fans, nor the young lads peddling their bikes on a Carribean island. It is a depressing film, a documentary about the break-up of a band.

See it for the Rooftop Concert. All the in-fighting, grumbling, and drama were forgotten, and for one brief moment it must have felt like old times. And so it will for you, watching the Beatles perform for the last time. Perhaps they were so happy because they knew, secretly, it would be their last concert, and they wanted the last one to be a good one, and create the magic they were known for, in a concert they will and should be remembered.",1369872000,2,2866,4.3841807909604515

1980496,5,B000192Y3G,"Those who managed and promoted the Beatles worked hard to make sure that only their best side was presented to the public.  I can't see Brian Epstein, if he had been alive at the time this movie was made, ever allowing it to be released in the form that it was.

However, the Beatles themselves seemed to have no such pretensions, and thankfully so, because otherwise those of us who enjoy everything about the Beatles would never have had this treasure.  And to anyone who really enjoys the Beatles, this is indeed a treasure.  It's easy to see in the film how much they enjoyed performing together, both in the studio and on the rooftop, and how every member of the band did their part.  All of these great performances make this DVD well worth the price.

Yes, there were some negative vibes between the members of the group.  To read some reviews, one could get the impression that this movie is mostly about the breakup of the group, but actually there were only a few small moments.  This is not to deny that there were a lot of things going on between the Beatles at that time.  History tells us that this was a very turbulent time.  However, very little of that is portrayed in the movie.

And as for the negative things that made it into the film, the editing was vey one-sided, concentrating on Paul, but ignoring moments between the other band members.  For example, one of John Lennon's biographies reported an argument between John and George during this time that nearly came to blows.  None of that made it into the film.  George was reported to have been the one most displeased and most vocal about the presence of Yoko, but none of that came out, either.

I would encourage anyone who really likes the Beatles to purchase this DVD.",1364515200,2,1749,4.525477707006369

Director Michael Lindsay-Hogg captures the band's creative process and inner turmoil during the studio rehearsals  leading to John, Paul, George and Ringo's historic 1969 rooftop concert (with a soulful assist from Billy Preston).

It is recorded in Dolby 5.1 sound and is the real deal. The picture isn't as good as the sound but still very good when converted to 1080P by my flat panel and AVR. I agree if you are looking for a story like Hard Days Night this is not it. The band is the dialog whether talking, arguing, or playing. I have to disagree with one reviewer who said George wasn't very upset with Paul. He may not have been screaming but he was mad enough to walk out. He didn't return until he contacted Billy Preston to come play with them. The main reason was George thought he would lighten the atmosphere and he did and the rest of the band welcomed him. It was a totally different session when he came on board. The bickering stopped and they got down to playing. He also played on the roof top concert with them. George Martin said Billy Preston was directly responsible for the music getting recorded there was so much ranker prior to him joining them. They didn't call him the 5th Beatle for nothing. If it is released again the roof top concert is worth the price alone. Over all I enjoy it. I have watched more times than I can count. In fact I just watched it this week. Just for info, I think I paid about 50.00 back then. Something that could play into this is the original album when first released was not on the market long before being pulled off the shelves. The rumor at the time was Paul and Apple thought there was too many bootlegs of it out there and they weren't getting the revenue and they felt like their fans were being ripped off so they pulled it.

1980598,3,B000192Y3G,"I've seen this movie/documentary, in total, years ago and have been trying to find it since.  This is a great ""fly on the wall"" look at the Fab Four going through the recording process of ""Let It Be"", warts and all.  There ARE good times, and obviously tense, and frustrating, moments between them, particularly, with Yoko hanging on John, as was usual at that time.  There was quite a row about having Yoko there, or any women, for that matter, during recording sessions. They had always recorded by themselves, with the exception of an engineer and George Martin.  The fact was, ever since Brian Epstein died, they managed themselves, which turned out to be not such a good idea.  They felt ""adrift"" without Brian's ""glue"" that kept them on the right track.

I don't know that Paul, Ringo, Yoko, and Georges wife, Olivia, will ever come to an agreement on re-releasing this documentary.  Personally, when I watched this movie the first time, I left feeling sad, tense, and a little ""let down"".  I think even though this documentary is of HUGE historical value, for this movie to be the ""last harrah"" for The Beatles, it leaves a sour taste in my mouth, and I would think the remaining Beatles and their wives would feel the same way.  Not a great way to go out, given who they are/were. Certainly, this is the OPPOSITE of, say, The Band's ""The Last Waltz"". I think most people would prefer to remember The Beatles greatness on their recordings, and on film, through ""A Hard Day's Night"" and Help!""

All in all, I ""personally"" wish that I could get a copy of this film, being a die-hard Beatles fan. But, I don't think it will EVER be re-released for public consumption for a LONG time, if ever.",1264291200,,1696,4.586092715231788
1980599,5,B000192Y3G,"Seemingly plot-less Let It Be appears as a rambling rag-tag collection of George Harrison, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and Ringo Starr getting together to rehearse material for a new album of songs. As a documentary, showing the artists develop little pieces of music in different ways with phrases of lyrics, piano, guitar and drums shows the indefinable process that culminates to form the Popular Song. As the process continues the overt personalities of the different artists become more prominent and the collaborative spirit that had seemed to be present earlier, dissolves and the character of each member begins to stand out. Paul seems intent on harnessing the talents of each of the members into a unified group to rehearse and find the magic that put the band on the top of the music charts, but the different members have strong independent ideas. Several songs are molded with Lennon and McCartney forging the way, and George toils away on the side with his songs, as Ringo sits in on songs and drums. The film culminates with the band chucking the idea of creating any new cutting edge tunes, and in a moment of public relations grandstanding carry their instruments up onto the roof of Apple Corps headquarters on Saville Row at lunch time on January 30, 1969 to perform, causing the Police to shut down their last public performance.

As a final tribute to possibly the world's greatest pop band Let It Be still remains as a sad reminder that the innocence of youth can never be regained except in reminiscence.

It was reported by George Harrison that it was Paul McCartney that pushed to make another movie about the Beatles and everyone else in the band, busy with wives, children and independent projects were all grumbling that they were prefer not to. In the film it is evident that Paul is overly enthusiastic about making another Beatle film and his gushing over little things seems at times overdone.

Some of the songs are very good, glowing with the old Beatle magic that comes from the combination of all the right talent working together on a single project. The musicians certainly know each other well musically and even at their most laid back they remain a tight ensemble, understanding through years of experience what the others will do and complimenting or countering it.

The Beatles won a 1970 Academy Award for Best Original Song Score, but in many ways this seems to be a ""gimmie"" considering that the Beatles had previously made A Hard Day's Night and Help and the songs from those movies were much catchier- it seems that given the demise of the band there was a consensus that the band should be given a distinct parting gift.",1254700800,,2670,4.810457516339869
1980600,2,B000192Y3G,"""Let it Be"" the movie was Officially released on VHS and Laserdisc in the 1980's and that for just a short preiod of time, they did a rush job on converting the film to VHS and Laserdisc, nothing fancy, no cleaning up the film nor enhancing the sound, and didn't even use the best print around, it is about the quality of see an old movie on tv, semi-grainy picture and a tin-cany sound, but fair is how i'd rate the quality, ""fair"".

Although, some DVD's now have the sound re-synched in the performace sections and that makes a much better improvement on the sound, the pic has never been pristine on these releases.

1980601,4,B000192Y3G,"The Beatles' farewell to all, LET IT BE is very much two films. The first painful 50 minutes are rehearsals, demos, noodling, carefully planned bursts of ad libitum piano banging and amateurish run throughs of 50s r&r. Paul lectures, reminisces and suggests while the others sit in clouds of detached tolerance. In almost every glimpse of her, Yoko looks either very stoned or very depressed (perhaps a combination of both).

The real Beatles emerge in the last half hour. Following a set of music video-quality performances is an impromptu outdoor concert, given on a cold, gray day.

SYNOPSIS--
(r) = rehearsal
Studio set up. ""Don't Let Me Down"" (r). Paul gives chords and band runs through ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer."" ""Two Of Us"" (r). ""I've Got a Feeling"" (r). ""One After 909"" fragment. Paul and Ringo do a 4-hand piano boogie. ""Two Of Us."" Paul and George feud civilly. Initial try of ""Across the Universe"" is very bad. ""I Dig a Pony"" (r). A bored Yoko reads newspaper. George on guitar demos ""I, Me, Mine,"" then John and Yoko waltz to an advanced version. End of segment.

""For You Blue"" is heard as group arrives in separate limos. Segue to them playing this song. John enjoys his slide guitar while Yoko sits defensively, stiff as a statue. Paul talks about film shot with Maharishi. They cut-up on ""Besame Mucho."" George and Ringo use piano to define ""Octopus's Garden."" John and Yoko hide in a corner. Paul has young Heather with him. Billy Preston sits in on electric piano for ""You've Really Got a Hold On Me."" Silly ""Long and Winding Road"" cha-cha, then a false start. Uninspired 50s r&r medley includes Billy. ""Dig It"" improv has material not heard on the LP.

From this point on, the boys absolutely shine.
Polished ""Two Of Us."" Into a magnificent ""Let It Be"" and ""Long and Winding Road."" To the rooftop for ""Get Back."" Curious business district onlookers gather below. Next is ""Don't Let Me Down."" Grumblings from older folks. Close-up of glassy-eyed Yoko. ""I've Got a Feeling,"" ""One After 909"" and ""I Dig a Pony"" as the police enter building. Reprise of ""Get Back"" given more for them than anyone becomes the last public performance of the legendary Beatles.

1980602,3,B000192Y3G,"By now, much of the story of LET IT BE is well known--so well known that incidents in the film which appeared to be fairly innocuous at the time are now infused with historical insight and context revealing the troubles, invectives and disrespect that finally did the band in.

When LET IT BE was released to theaters in 1970, the public was given little clue to what they were about to see.  Many of us, my girlfriend and I included, were expecting a theatrical production such as A HARD DAY'S NIGHT or HELP!  In other words, a movie with something resembling a plot but mostly songs and humor.  That is definitely not what we got (much less what you will get).

Originally, this documentary was intended for television and not the big screen.  This explains the soft visual resolution.  Many, with justice, will complain that the images are fuzzy much of the time and lack sharpness all of the time.  LET IT BE was made a good ten to twelve years before the advent of the ""music video"".  When the Beatles are intentionally performing to the camera, it is visually static and there is no attempt at anything resembling a ""storyline"".  As a film, LET IT BE is fairly primitive technically and one is left with the overall impression  that the filmmakers were confused and unsure what it was they wanted to ""say"".

For some reason, folk in the creative arts have an intense interest in how a movie or, in this case, an album is built and put together.  That the general public is only interested in the final product escapes many creative types.  The plain fact in that the trial and error process as the artist make his way step by step is pretty boring most of the time.

And that is what we have here.  Let It Be is a series of disconnected starts and stops along with the Beatles wasting time and effort--and, not incidentally, boring themselves.  (One source informs that the rest of the Beatles hated McCartney's Maxwell's ""Silver Hammer"" which is practiced in the film because McCartney insisted going through over a hundred trial runs to get it ""right"".)  Often the songs are old rock and roll tunes right out of their ""bar band"" days in Hamburg and Liverpool.  Most of these are unknown to American audiences (for good reason) and are not particularly interesting.  As my girlfriend and I sat watching all this, one could tell the audience was frustrated and fidgety.  Minds wandered.  One scene that did stick out was the disturbing confrontation between Paul McCartney and George Harrison.  It only lasted a few seconds on film.  Even still, it left us wondering what was going on.  Whatever it was, we sensed, it was not good.

What was truly unsettling was that the group that just a few years before were apostles of peace and love are gone here.  Indeed, they appear to be about nothing.  To those of us enthralled to the worldwide telecast of ""All You Need Is Love"", it was heartbreaking.

The tedium goes on and on.  Suddenly, when the band performed ""Let It Be"" itself, the entire movie theater broke out in applause and shouts of approval.  Fortunately, from here, the movie picks up.  ""Let It Be"" is followed by ""The Long and Winding Road"" and The Concert On The Roof.

The Concert On The Rood nearly redeems the entire movie.  Would that all of LET IT BE had been a concert film.  The short concert the Beatles performed from the roof of the Apple building is full of all the fun and humor we had come to expect from the corpus of Beatles films and albums.  If you see nothing else, this concert is worth all the time and every penny you could invest.  Chances are, you will watch it again and again.

It is difficult to recommend LET IT BE save the actually performance of the same titled song and The Concert On The Road.  However, if you are a fan and can see your way to spend the money, it is worth it for those two parts.  Just be forewarned.  Maybe just skip most of it.",1241481600,4,3897,4.502139800285307

Upon viewing outtakes of the Beatles developing arrangements for ""All things Must Pass"" or witnessing a chance encounter with Peter Sellars, I was certain that I was watching proto-reality TV but with authenticity. The footage of Let it be has historic value and deserves a package that will restore not only the image quality but the chronological order in which it was filmed.

1980645,5,B000192Y3G,"The 1970 movie 'Let It Be' is an extremely important document of The Beatles at work. May I remind you, that's THE Beatles; no other. Anything this band set itself to do had and continues to have great musical merit. The song material is always compelling; tons of Lennon-McCartney numbers played by uh, well, Lennon and McCartney, together, with the vital elements of Starr and Harrison that made up this most important of rock music bands. The tensions that coexisted with the special chemistry of The Beatles are all laid bare before the viewer here, diamonds, scars and all. And it is difficult to run a rock'n'roll band, I know from experience, I've been in three of them (not The Beatles, if I remember correctly). If I had gone to a Beatles show and all I had seen was the four of them slugging it out with each other in a fist fight after playing two bars of 'We Can Work It Out', I STILL would have left the show satisfied that I'd gotten my money's worth. These guys just could not play a bad note. They were too talented and knew each other too well. Jagger & Richards were correct when they said that the decline and/or breakup of The Beatles was related to their not performing live any longer. And while they make great music together in this film, one gets the impression that The Beatles should have been out there playing in front of an audience, not just cooped up in the studio. Hence the high spirits when the band play their brief rooftop show. All the band's performances in 'Let It Be' are wonderful; the roughshod versions of songs like 'You've Really Got A Hold On Me' are especially great, in fact all the better for their spontaneity and roughness, to my mind. The Beatles forged their sound in rough Hamburg bars, survived, developed, and could outblast any band. That vital heritage shows up in the performances in 'Let It Be', a most important audio-visual document. This must be given the blu-ray treatment for future release. I must confess to something quite unexpected; while all my life a fan of John Lennon's musical efforts particularly, I am going through a kind of re-appreciation/discovery of the musical (and noise) talents of Paul McCartney. In particular, when given a chance, the guy could scream like noone else in rock'n'roll. Recall if you will choice parts of a) 'I'm Down', at the end, and 2) 'Helter Skelter', and 3) 'Oh, Darling!' (and parts of post-Beatles 'Maybe I'm Amazed' on his first solo album). Paul could really, really scream his head off when the need arose; which must surely be the reason why the Queen conferred a knighthood on him.",1232928000,3,2597,4.647826086956521
1980646,5,B000192Y3G,"Firstly its a great film. The Beatles creating great music, and yes,they were creating great music, despite George Harrison leaving (the accurate word would be ""fleeing"") during the sessions

Previously Ringo had left during the White Album. John would flee later, with his Plastic Ono Band, and that would be it, with Paul being the last to leave, and having to sue his bandmates in the process

Thats neither here or there. Paul does ""Let it Be"" on his piano, he plays on the piano with Ringo, which is charming. It reminds me of the old Marx Brothers films when Chico and Harpo would be playing a same piano at the same time. A lot of fun

I tell ya, if you didn't know the band had broken up during Let it Be, you wouldn't guess it from the footage, which is mostly musical. Theres the odd talking between the band members, and Yokos there as well (WTF?!)

But you get to watch Paul teaching Maxwell's to the band, going through the chords, which I got a kick from. You see the boys working on the solo for ""I've got a feeling"" - which would be one of the last songs Paul and John would ever collaborate on (the song ends with each doing their own song: John's ""Everybody had a hard year"" & Paul's ""I've got a feeling"" bit

So that works very well, as John's ""Everybody had a hard year"" (which he wrote in India) is more of a fragment of a song, and works very well as part of the tune. I've Got A Feeling is a standout on the album, and REALLY ROCKS

George does the odd waltz (I Me Mine) and although he was as prolific as the others (his first solo after the breakup would be a 3lp for Gods sake, just to cover the backflow of songs!)
noones interested, noone wanted to be there. Although this doesn't come across in the film, recording Let It Be was an unhappy period for the band, and only returning to Abbey Road (for a little space at least) revitalized the project (George insisted on it to return to the Let it Be sessions)

Whether this will ever see release on dvd.. dunno. The Magnetic Video is ok, but it has a grainy look, and the 1981 video release is hard to come across, unless you have a local library with the old release you can check it out from.

Well worth seeing. I personally think its the best film by the band, but then its nice to see the band ROCK OUT. Them jamming on the roof with Preston is worth the price of admission

Try to find a dvd of it though, or on laserdisc. The prices its going for even for an official Magnetic Video release are simply too much even for Amazon!",1224374400,3,2511,4.225469728601253
1980647,5,B000192Y3G,"I saw this film at the movies when it came out, and have had it on VHS (poor quality). As many have said, it offers a dark and sad portrait in many parts. Over the years, though, while waiting for a hopefully restored re-release on DVD, I've come across many audio Get Back bootlegs from the same period as well as quite a few outtakes from Let It Be. And I have to say that for every downer scene in Let It Be, there is a scene that didn't make it into the movie in which the boys are obviously having a damn good time. (""Commonwealth"" is one jam-session song that comes to mind.) In any case, one can always hope that the re-release (whenever it happens) comes with a lot of these ""outtakes"" so us fans can get a more balanced picture.",1222214400,4,737,4.160839160839161

1980649,4,B000192Y3G,"Being a Beatles fan for more the 40 years and studying every aspect of thier carrie as a group. This is not a fitting end to the group. Given the fact that both John and George were basically finished with the group at the time, it shows rather sadly how Paul was trying to keep things going and good old Ringo just trying to keep it all together. Plus that this was filmed and recorded a year before the group spilt up, it should not be looked upon as thier swan song. Remember Paul got them, as he always did in the past, into Abbey Road Studios and with the help of Sir George Martin, recorded the excellent ""Abbey Road "" album. It's too bad those sessions were not recorded.

I still though can't be helped to be drawn in someway to this film and album. I have enough bootlegs of the ""Get Back/Let It Be"" sessions, to know that some of the songs were very strong. Particulary John's, ""Don't Let Me Down"" with flubbed second verse but a full version of the song, as well as George's ""I Me Mine"" which we don't get a full version of in the film. The filming is very intimate giving the viewer the impression of being in the studio with the group. The one issue that has always bothered me that aside from ""The Long and Winding Road"", ""Let it Be"" and ""For You Blue"" and some jamming as well as the roof top sessions. A lot of the songs are left incomplete. There is an excellent jam at the Twickenham studios with both John and Paul at the mic, sort of remincent of when they performeed ""Ticket to Ride"" or ""Baby's in Black"" while on tour, perfoming ""Two of Us"" as a rocking number too bad this was cut short. Having a number of Beatles DVD's and a leatst two with many hours of outakes from the ""Get Back/Let it Be"" film, we are spared the John, Paul, Ringo and Yoko Ono jam session. This footage is hard to watch.

All in all it's a needed piece of Beatles history and I am looking forward to seeing it on an official relsease DVD.

1980650,4,B000192Y3G,"...It's not always a pretty sight.  The Beatles decided to film ""all the warts"" during the making of an album, which, for even the most amicable of musical entities, is a difficult and often acrimonious process.  McCartney, in his perpetually optimistic view, thought this would re-ground the band back to the ""old glory days"".  And Lennon agreed the Beatles were best when they just played ""rock & roll"".

As the story goes, McCartney suggested a number of ideas for this project including a live concert performance at some wondrous secure location somewhere on Earth, or perhaps a series of ""back to the club"" performances.  Each of these ideas was vetoed by both Harrison and Lennon.  In fact, George was never really into this project at all, and it shows in the film.  He was at the time becoming a world-class writer and producer, yet was still treated as a 2nd class talent by both McCartney and Lennon.

The film itself is an effective deconstruction of the creation of a new album by the most popular band on the planet - and this unofficial release is a good, slightly grainy, no-frills copy of the film.  It shows three powerful personalities leveraging for space and time behind the camera and for position on the upcoming album.  I'm not sure it would come off any different if it was presented by the Rolling Stones during this era.

Indeed, Keith Richards, who was as close as anybody to the Beatles, once lamented that he couldn't understand why they threw in the towel.  He suggested that perhaps a 1-2 year hiatus could've kept things in-tact for the group.  One can only wonder, had the Beatles went on a ""break"" instead of a break-up, how things might have worked out...",1213315200,3,1691,4.710884353741497
1980651,5,B000192Y3G,"I purchased this DVD from an online store who specilizes rare DVDs and I could finaly see what was famous or infamous ""Get Back Session"" about.

We can feel some from Let It Be album and also watch in Anthology DVD and CD. I even bought Let It Be...Naked. Yet these were not enough for me. I have watched this DVD again and again, probably 100 times and more. It contains too much to mention: each Beatle's character and attitude at that time, relationship among them (as often discussed), tense and loose times during the session, yet the buzz of their music, which ends up with ""Rooftop Gig"". Also I am aware of that if a beginning fan who does not know them much or a light ""mania"" would watch this, he/she would say ""what's this all about?"" or just ""non-sense"". I am a ""hard-core"". If you follow their history, musically and personally, this film will be the gem though The Beatles don't share happy memories among them. Yet I can see some buzz and excitement during the session and ""Rooftop Gig"".

I Do like to say that you should get this film in anyway available from any source available (mostly online) if you are a hard-core, rather than just waiting for an official release (Apple? EMI? Who knows?).

Also, if I tag this film, I prefer ""Let It Be"" to ""Let It Be...Naked"". If you listen to ""I've got a feeling"" in ""Let It Be"" carefully, you would notice echoes and fades that was from ""Rooftop Gig"" as in the FILM!!. You can hear some jokes and conversations as you hear in the film, vise versa. I understand Paul never agrees with Phil Specter's production, but we can listen to history (including the recording technology then, which causes some awkwardness and defects for the perfect standard). To me, ""...Naked"" is a typical ""digitally remastered"". It does sound better for sure but for the historical view, I don't fully agree to its worth.

Again, I'd like to say that you should get this DVD from available source in anyway. I am sure you will watch this again and again if you are a true Beatle hard-core like me.

I have seen footage of the movie that has clearly been restored and it looks wonderful to say the least. There must be an already restored version of the movie somewhere in the vaults of Apple Corps, but I suspect there's still a lot of red tape or hurdles to overcome for a wide release.

1980715,4,B000192Y3G,"The album of original material to come out of the ""Get Back"" sessions of early 1969 was, quite frankly, lousy, at least by Beatles standards.  John Lennon was right when he said that Let it Be (the album and the film) exposed the ""myth"" that was the Beatles.  The myth wasn't that the Beatles were great but that they were incapable of mediocrity.  John's efforts, alone, on the album prove just how mediocre they could be when they gave up trying.

Let it Be, the film, is disjointed and patchy, which is to be expected when hundreds of hours of film is taken with no vision or direction as to what it is to show.  It's poorly edited and, as everyone knows, sadly shows the break up of the world's greatest band.

Despite all that, Let it Be is a fascinating film.  Where else can you see a band of that quality at work in the studio?  What other film shows you four (real) friends, strained by years together, familial changes and business disagreements, fighting and loving one another?  Not many other films -- interviews, movies, the Anthology, you name it -- show the Beatles interacting together in an unstaged, unrehearsed way.

The highlight of the movie is, indeed, the rooftop concert.  While it is clear that the level of interest in during the rehearsal portions, at times, just wasn't there, on the rooftop, the boys let their hair down (literally and figuratively) and played with a lot of fire and energy.  The last image of the Beatles together that we have been left with was of four guys, who changed the world, having fun together, playing good rock and roll.  That alone makes this movie worthwhile.

The VHS quality is not particularly good, but diehard Beatles fans will take this film in any format or condition that we can get it.  Hopefully soon Apple Corps. will release an updated, remastered DVD set with loads and loads of extras.",1150156800,14,1860,4.6109422492401215

  If, it is true that you are worried about what your legacy might be, with your future fans of  ""The Beatles"". Maybe you need an old fan's perspective with a few suggestions.

  Produce a video, (DVD) of what's involved with the re-mastering process of your catalog. Then release it to any T.V. and cable station that will play it. Then sell the DVD to the public.

  These re-mastered CD's should be released in 5.1 and/or SACD formats. Release your catalog to a MP3 downloadable site.

  Get the ""Let it be"" DVD done.

  On your Beatles website put a store on it. Where your fans can buy all your ""apple corps ltd. authorized products"".

  When all of these things are done and ready to be released. You and Ringo should do the talk show circuit to talk (not play) about it.

  Remember when Gary Grant did those ""An Evening with Gary Grant"" traveling road shows?  Where people would pay to hear him tell of his experiences in show business and ask him questions. You and Ringo could do the same thing but also film it and then sell the DVD's.

Now the Beatles had been broken up for 6 years at this time. We went up to the steps of the building and saw that famous white door on the entrance. It had been heavily graffitied. There was a doorman at a building next door, who told us that in the basement all the recording equiptment was still in the basement. He also told that the building was actually a facade. You saw the front of the building, but he said the back had been torn down(do not know if this is true or not), any way that was the higlight of the day, and to top it off that night on the BBC they were showing Let it Be on the telly.

1980719,5,B000192Y3G,"The last time I saw ""Let it Be"" was 35 years ago, and at the time it was something of a jolt.  Afterall, the last time I saw the Beatles on film before ""Let it Be"" was in ""Help"" when they were in their mid 20's and they were still the loveable mop tops made up for the film.

In ""Let it Be"" I saw four guys approaching 30 crawling out of bed obviously too early in the morning and trying to put together an album.  Now that I have seen a bit more of life myself, there isn't much that remarkable about the days in the lives of John, Paul, George and Ringo, except the music and the historical record of the Beatles last public appearance together.

One myth about the film that needs to be abandoned is that it documents the breakup of the group.  In the DVD version, one sees various combinations of Beatles enjoying one another's company, joyfully warming up with oldies, Ringo being spoofed by Linda's daughter, John looking very graceful dancing with Yoko and a very enjoyable 20 minute concert on the roof.  The so-called spat between Paul and George was about as serious as a pitcher and catcher trying to get their signals straight.

I don't pretend to know why the Beatles really broke up, but I don't think it had anything to do with ""Let it Be.""  The music came so easily for them back then and their brillance oozed from their collective soul manifested by little guitar rifts and vocalizations that didn't always find their ways into the finished product.

The state of the Beatles' relationships with one another was at an all-time low, due to personal and professional strains, and it certainly shows in the film. Grim and voyeuristic, it is a well-made film but for serious fans only. Even for them it is liable to be a depressing experience. The Beatles' goodwill towards one another had evaporated completely. Lennon's increasingly bizarre behavior can be attributed to either his well-developed taste for heroin or Yoko Ono's constant presence, which greatly annoyed the rest of the group during these sessions. John can barely disguise his boredom or contempt of the material, while Paul attempts to hold the group together, only to be resented as pushy and domineering. George is detached and even Ringo looks like he's about had it. Saddest of all, the video outtakes and recordings bootlegged from these sessions show that Let It Be's dreary footage actually represents the cheeriest material from early 1969. The film's climax is the famous ""Rooftop Concert"" on top of Abbey Road Studios, which proved to be the Beatles' final ""public"" performance. It's a bit of a let-down, as the Beatles go fairly quietly when the constables arrive, but the whole episode is bizarre enough to pay off.

It's cool to see Billy Preston playing with them, which leads me to wish they had considered having other 'guests' come in and jam with them for the film (such as Clapton or Dylan).  The fighting is unfortunate... Paul seems pushy, John seems arrogant, George is uninterested, Ringo is quiet.  But there are also some great happy moments, and they are still obviously friends.  But in terms of style, appearance and music, this version of the Beatles is MUCH cooler than the Help or Hard Day's Night era of the band, and some of the performances here as I mentioned are AMAZING.

1980764,2,B000192Y3G,"The biggest problem with this movie is that the movie itself doesn't live up to it's legend. If you didn't know anything about the fab fours later years this is what you'll get out this movie: Band jamming in sound stage then cut away to band jamming in building then cut away to band jamming on roof - the end. The film only works if you have piror knowledge of the events of early 1969 that lead to the band demise. Thus film itself suffers from the same hurdle that most rock movies of this time come across: a lack of narrative. Why are they on the roof? What is the building they're jamming in, are they recording? And the sad fact is that there is footage out there that could rectify this.

In 1996's 'The Beatles Anthology' we got the scenes of the band and crew discussing the concert on the roof, talking to the camera's about why they chose a sound stage and more importantly the aims of the whole 'Get Back' project. Even some subtitles at the bottom of the screen could give this mess a bit of direction. If this film ever gets released it needs a needs a new cut, including all the meetings the band has with the crew, the on camera interviews with Paul and of course some of the tense moments that occurred while making the movie. Yes, there is the famous scene of Paul and George arguing over how the lead to 'I've Got A Feeling' should be played but for the rest of the bickering that most Beatles fans have heard on bootlegs of outtakes have all been glossed over.

On the positive side the performances are great, even if 'Let It Be' did boast some of the fabs weakest efforts the music is still worth sitting through the seemingly pointless scenes of dialogue. In saying that, 'Let It Be' is not a bad movie, in fact I'd say it's a great movie that's been poorly hacked up. This makes it only worth it if you know enough already to read between the lines.",1095897600,27,1875,4.293785310734464

However, I am still glad that I bought it. Yes, there are arguments and the ever-present Yoko (Yucko as I like to call her) but there are some wonderful scenes of the group jamming together, smiling, laughing and just having fun! The tension is at times visible but not overwhelming. Of course, we do see the downside, each one of The Beatles are more individuals at this point, they look different from each other and have distinctly different music styles. Some may be mad at me for this but Paul did seem as though he was trying to take over. However, I will admit that Ringo and George didn't want the decision-making responsibilities and John was falling further into the Yoko-void and losing interest in other things he once cared about.
But as I said, there are some great scenes. For example, the rooftop concert at the end. John and Paul are smiling at each other, joking around and fooling around with some of the songs. Everyone truly looks as if they're enjoying themselves. Even right up to the end The Beatles still had their magic, no fights could ever take away the fact that as musicians, they gelled like no other group ever has before or since! Their coming together for songs like ""Don't Let Me Down"" ""Let it Be"" ""The Long and Winding Road"" ""I've Got a Feeling"" ""Get Back"" and John and Paul singing together for ""Two of Us"" shows that there was still cohesion, combined creativity and joy in the making of their music!
I think this film, along with ""A Hard Days Night"" ""Help!""

I certainly hope they don't change anything for a new release, in fact I am hoping they put out an original Let It Be release on DVD and also follow up with a second release showing some of the hundreds of hours of tape took during that taping that were never published.

If Paul didn't want to be seen in bad light, why then include the Let It Be filmed ""Paul-George argument"" in the Anthology Series? Paul himself has admitted he can see how he might have contributed to certain tensions at the time. But remember, as others have pointed out, the band was a hotbed of various moods and emotions at the time...John, joined at the hip with Yoko, was ready to leave the Beatles to do his own thing; George's songwriting had developed significantly but was frustrated at the limited chances to showcase his work; Paul was trying to hold it all together but inadvertently alienated the other members in the process; Ringo being Ringo just went with the flow.  Plus the Apple thing was happening, the Klein management issues etc. etc.
Bickering aside, what the film does reveal however is a band that could work together and play some great music when need be. I'm quite confident that another edit of the film would probably paint a different picture. Tensions occur in any band no matter how tight they are. These guys spent the best part of their youth together. That they made the brilliant ""Abbey Road"" after this is a testament to their huge talent.

1980771,5,B000192Y3G,"Not really, but it sure looked like it was possible when the Bobbies raided the Beatles last live performance on the rooftop of Apple headquarters on that cold blustery day.  Witness Mal Evans turn off George's amplifier(while he's playing!)during the reprise of Get Back, while a stunned John misses some of his lead guitar parts.  Meanwhile, Paul and Ringo jam on, with Paul insisting at the end that they could be arrested for playing on the rooftops again(and their Mommy wouldn't like that!). Of course John has the last word with the famous ""I'd like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves, and I hope we passed the audition!""
All of the bickering and unpleasantness aside, the rooftop concert was great fun, and showed that when the Beatles had to give a performance, they could still bring it on home.  Jump back to the beginnings, and it is January, 1969.  The tired Beatles commence in London's Twickenham studios to be filmed while ""getting back"" to their roots...i.e. playing good ol' rock and roll like the old days, without all of the studio gimmicks and overproduction.  But the ill will and uneasy feelings that started during the ""White Album"" sessions were still an open wound, and thus infected the Get Back sessions as well.
There are so many other things that make the movie a must-see for Beatles fans.  Ringo having a playful moment with Paul's step daughter Heather in the studio.  A smacked up John and Yoko in their ""own world"" off in a corner or dancing a waltz,  and the famous George remark that he would play his guitar anyway that Paul would like or ""not play at all"" if that was what he wanted.  Then we get to see Paul tell George that ""he's not out to get him at all; he's trying to help him"".  Also, it's a gas to hear John sing a few ""gobbledygook"" lyrics during ""Don't Let Me Down"" on the rooftop concert.
Some see it as sad that the film portrayed such a great band in the disintegration mode. But I see it as a part of history, and the inevitable result of separate ego's finally coming to a head after so many hard years together(especially with ""Beatlemania"" making virtual prisoners of the boys wherever they went).  By this time, add all of the legal troubles with Apple that pitted Paul against the others(he wanted the Eastmans; the others wanted, and got Allen Klein, who they ended up sueing later after they found out what a slime he was), George's growing list of unrecorded music and disenchantment with being bossed around ""Beatle George"", and a very much in love John bringing Yoko to most of the sessions, and you had a storm brewing that couldn't be stopped.
All in all, it is a great documentary on the Beatles doing what they did best....making music.  And it remains as a solid reminder that even after this seeming end, they were able to re-group once more with George Martin to produce their last album  Abbey Road, with the fitting finale(Her Majesty notwithstanding!), ""And in the end, the Love You take is equal to the Love You make"".
A footnote to the ""Paul bashers"" that seem to think that He and He alone is responsible for holding the release of this gem on DVD.  He remarked that he is asked about the DVD release quite frequently, and that Neil Aspinall(who is still in charge of day to day running of the Apple businesses)has been given free rein to get it done.  Hopefully, the wait is due to having a good job done with plenty of extras!",1069372800,2,3423,4.552117263843648

Replaced it a couple of times, of course.  It's time  for a release on DVD so I can finally show everyone what I've been talking about for years!!!",1064016000,2,304,4.172413793103448

1980825,4,B000192Y3G,"I have seen this film many times, and many times I have found it disheartening.
Always innovative, the Beatles set out to create a ""live"" documentary showing them live in the studio recording.  The results are somewhat disasterous as we see the group literally falling apart before our eyes.  Both George Harrison and Ringo Starr had walked out during the filming. One scene showing Harrison and McCartney bickering over a guitar riff shows the tension the group was feeling at the time.  The fact that Abbey Road even got recorded is short of a miracle.
The remainder of the film however, shows how creative and talented the Beatles truly were and it's for this reason this film must be in any Beatle's fan collection.  Sadly, the original mixes of most of this music have yet to see the light of day short of bootlegs and the very rare issue of Get Back in Russia.  That this was their last released album only contributes to a cardboard tombstone to a group that surely deserved better approach on this project.
If you can overlook the fact that the Beatles were already broken up when this was released, it should be good viewing to catch a glimpse of them at their finest hour.  Oddly enough, few groups were to follow suit with their own documentaries, and probably should have.  This film once again set new standards and is well worth a view.",1061683200,6,1350,4.623430962343096
1980826,5,B000192Y3G,"... January 30, 1969, the Beatles performed on the rooftop of Apple Records in London. The last time the group played together. The memories of that day will always live in the hearts of all Beatles fans. To the DVD, we can just all hope and sing - Let It Be, Let It Be. There will be an answer, Let It Be.",1060300800,,306,3.9516129032258065
1980827,5,B000192Y3G,"I have a VHS tape of Let it Be that I bought in 1984, copyrighted in 1981. The VHS tape was distributed by Magnetic Video, a Twentieth Century Fox Company, Industrial Park, Farmington Hills, Michigan. I literally have seen the movie several thousand times and continue to watch every six months or so.  It is a must see for any true Beatle fan.  The long version of ""Dig It"" is unbelievable.  The 45 seconds of ""Dig It"" on the album is straight from the middle of the film version.  The entire session at the Apple studios is fantastic, not to mention the classic rooftop songs and the reaction of the people in the streets. It would be nice to know when this film will make it to DVD.  My VHS tape is barely hanging on.",1058400000,3,720,4.303703703703704
1980828,4,B000192Y3G,"Tensions flare and personalities clash. Accurate portrayal of the fab four dissolving. The film culminates with a performance on the Abbey Road studio roof, the first live Beatles show in four years. Mayhem ensues and the police are called in to stop the madness. As for the music ""Let It Be"", with its angst and frankness, show a mature Beatles displaying both roots (One after 909)and feelings (I dig a pony). A must-have for Beatles fans.",1043280000,2,441,4.815789473684211
1980829,5,B000192Y3G,"I watched it years ago, many times. It was a VHS copy.
It shows the real drama of the Beatles' last days, but also great rehearsals and live performances of ""Don't Let Me Down"", ""Let it Be"", ""Get Back"", ""I Me Mine"", ""The Long and Windin Road"", ""For You Blue"", ""One After 909""...Really exciting to see them playing with Billy Preston on piano, both in the studio and on top of the Apple building!!!
Since it has no narrator, it's probably boring for non Beatles' fans.
It is a very valuable piece for collectors.
Simply great.",1036800000,2,525,4.479166666666667
1980830,5,B000192Y3G,"Thousands of people around the world may feel cheated by fate by not having been around during the Beatles era. By coming out
with this DVD, most of them can actually transport themselves in time when almost everything revolved around one thing - The Beatles. Even the most wretched moments in their lives as a band
brings monumental release of exhiliration and excitement by merely witnessing the events which lead to the sinking of the Titanic. It's also heart breaking to watch the film evolve because it leads you to a  singularity, a painful end.
Even the Beatles, at that time did not see this film other than as an exercise in torture but today thousands consider it as history unfolded, a legacy to future generations.",1036540800,4,726,4.761904761904762
1980881,5,B000192Y3G,"I understand that the Vhs and LD versions of this documentary were released around 1981. Since then I have never heard of it being released again. I watched it on television some time in the early eighties (unfortunately I did not record it then).
It seems that most visual products of the Beatles have already been released either in Vhs tapes, LD or DVD but not this documentary. There must be a reason behind that bearing in mind that it is still a very much if not the most sought after item by millions of beatle fans in the world, young and old, who have yet owned it. It might be that the surviving members of the Beatles did not want it to be released again. Why? Simply because it was a sad and miserable documentary which showed how the band was about to be broken up under the tension among its members. Following the death of George Harrison, I wonder and I very much doubt that this will ever be released again in DVD, Vhs or whatever version.
Luckily, a friend of mine bought the bootleg VCD version of it somewhere and somehow, and he kindly let me watch it in his place.
The Beatles is still the all time greatest and the most influential rock n' roll band in the world. There is no question about that. It has even become part of the western civilization. I do not see that the popularity of the band would ever fade or even lessen in decades to come. More than 30 years after the breakup of the band, even its out-take (visual or audio) is treasured by the fans. There can be no other successful band in the world, past present or even in the future, which can reach such a dimension.",1036022400,31,1602,4.30794701986755
1980882,5,B000192Y3G,"I still remember myself running to the store to buy a betamax version of Let It Be. At that time I was around 13 or 14, so I couldn't get too much of what was going on those sessions. Lennon being evasive and hiding behind some equipment with Yoko......Paul sort of scolding John, and George ......all weird things to me...but it was The Beatles, and that was enough !!!!!!!.....Let it Be breaks the Beatles spell, and shows the reality of their lives in 1969. It's a piece of history for zillions of Beatle fans. Bring the DVD.",1035849600,2,528,4.453608247422681
1980883,4,B000192Y3G,"This is the Beatles in their most wretched state.  Arguing, bored, resentful of each other's talents, each other's songs,  each other's wives and lovers.  Trying to paste together a session that ends up in such a bad state that John Lennon simply wanted to shelve this entire period, and put it away for good.
On the other hand, this film has some of the most exciting filming of the Beatles ever done when they go on top of their Apple headquarters building in the cold month of January in 1969 and totally captivate a rag-tag audience.  For that moment alone, this DVD has to be released.  The promised unedited album would be another huge plus for us fans.",1034726400,,659,4.5508474576271185
1980884,5,B000192Y3G,I agree that this important Beatles film should be on DVD. I see on EBay that sellers are listing for sale this film on DVD - so are they selling bootlegs or what? Many of their listings purport to be of a limited edition official DVD! So what is going on here? Release an OFFICIAL digitally remastered version of LET IT BE (similar to A hard day's night) and put the bootleggers out of business!!!,1034467200,2,398,4.32
1980885,5,B000192Y3G,"The final scene of the movie shows the Beatles performing in public on a roof in London. This was their first ""concert"" since a 1966 show in San Francisco and would be their last. So much for multi-million dollar reunion concert tours rehashing songs from bygone periods. The roof top scenes last maybe twenty minutes, but they are well worth the cost of this DVD if it ever is released. Thankfully we never will see these rock gods performing today like the other English band from this period who look as though their skin are about to fall off their faces.",1033689600,4,559,4.544554455445544

Let It Be is special because it shows the Beatles making music and working toguether, Paul teaching the rest of the band the chords to ""Maxwell's silver hammer"", this is reason enough to get DVD title, also you get to see the break-up of the best band that ever existed.",1027382400,,388,4.256756756756757
1980888,5,B000192Y3G,"I have an old video copy (out of print) of this documentary film and eagerly await the DVD release.  The film is an interesting glimpse of 4 very good friends who have spent just a little too much time with each other; one sees the love, but you also see the mounting frustration. The fact that nothing is candy coated is precicely why one ought to see LET IT BE. Paul and George's snit is the most famous scene (save the rooftop  concert finale), and not to be missed. George's retort to Paul (who still hasn't got the sound he wants from George)...""What ever it is that will please you, I'll do it [annoying sigh]""  rivals George's scene in AHDN's "" She's a drag, a well known drag, we turn the sound down on her and say rude things""! One gets the distinct impression he wanted to turn the sound down on Paul! Paul, here,  is an incessant cheerleader...trying to hold the dream together and you can tell the others simply want to move on, or at least take a year or two off.  George's expressions while assisting with Paul's "" Maxwell's Silver Hammer"" are priceless. George had a disdain for Paul's ""fruitier"" tunes and it is very evident on film. But there are genuine nuggets of love and musical beauty. John and Paul duet  ""Two of Us"" is particularly warm and lovely.  George looking almost as handsome as he did in Sgt. Pepper does a wonderful job with ""For you Blue"". Paul does come off as a bit of a Prima Donna, but his vocal talents are awe-inspiring. ""Besame Mucho"" never sounded so good. He is in top form for ""I've Got a Feeling"".  Paul's best instrument during this time, clearly, was his voice.  And Paul receives 5 stars for the best Beatle Beard, hands down! There is one scene where Paul's adoration of John is clearly evident. Look for it when this Beatle classic finally gets released.
Anyone calling themselves a Beatle fan must have this in their collection.",1026432000,,1880,4.489736070381231
