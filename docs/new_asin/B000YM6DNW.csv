3033256,2,B000YM6DNW,"I have to send it off to a friend,  that likes it , General  Hospital shouldn't even be on it ! it leaves alot to be desired! The Charge nurse is a disgrace, The Dr, that thinks he knows everything, needs to go somewhere and think about how to act , he was a loud mouth ass in Rocky 5 and he is a jerk in Night shift! Now why in the blue blazes, would you put someone like Billy Dee as a clean up man ? The person that was the Charge Dr, should be  Billy  Dee's role and  the one that was a jerk should be cleaning! The one you chose for charge nurse needs to be in Security. She has got a loud enough mouth! I didn't want to see Robin in the shower! She played back up in General hospital, she should of stayed that way, Too many new faces! The only good thing that happened was the bomb!  VERY DISAPPOINTED!
My Son could do better and he is 16! No wonder it didn't last, I wast'ed my money!............peace  Georgette",1356998400,2,920,3.967391304347826

3033259,5,B000YM6DNW,"I purchased this DVD as I wanted a better copy of my triplets Amanda, Miranda, and Maryssa playing baby Jake. We selected which child based on the scene as each was and acted a little different. Our children had almost 20 minutes of face time in this episode. I do think they played Jake pretty well. If you look them up they are The Jones Girls. The show was great and to see how professional the actors was amazing! In the scene where the old lady is talking to baby Jake Miranda begins to actually looking at me next to the camera man. Then the lady does exactly what is needed to get her attention for a good scene. They were all wonderful people to meet and work with.",1347062400,,673,4.224806201550388
3033260,5,B000YM6DNW,"As a fan if General Hospital for over ten years I was very excited for the spin-off and I wasn't disappointed! While it is not as fantastic as the daytime GH (since all of the characters are not in it) it is quite good. For those who complain that GH isn't focused enough on the actual hospital, this will surely make up for it because this is solely focused on the happenings of the hospital. The best thing about season one is that my man Jason Morgan is in the premiere season! That was the sole reason I initially tuned in but I ended up loving the show on its' own! For any General Hospital fan this is a must see (and a must own, especially cause you get to have some Jason of your very own...)!",1346025600,2,701,4.124087591240876
3033261,5,B000YM6DNW,"I bought this dvd set. its based more on the actual hospital then it is mob wars. it still gives you a kick of drama but its all in the GH, not every where else. I loved that it introduces new characters and shows more of other ones, Like Jason! and Robin/ Patrick. it gives them all a new look. ""Stone cold""'s softer side. and Robin and Patrick's flaws. its great. I love it!",1330214400,,376,4.094594594594595

3033263,5,B000YM6DNW,I am a big fan of General Hospital. I loved the night shift because it had story lines that were separated from the daytime General Hospital. I can't wait to get the 2nd season on dvd as well.,1310774400,,192,4.078947368421052
3033264,5,B000YM6DNW,"I enjoyed both seasons of Night Shift. Season One was great, and Season Two was even better, if that's possible. The only thing I don't understand is why ABC hasn't released Season Two on DVD yet. Are they waiting until everyone forgets about the show? Please, ABC, release Season Two so I can have a complete collection!",1285977600,6,321,4.649122807017544

3033266,5,B000YM6DNW,I'm surprised by the reviews on here. I enjoyed watching this series very much. Maybe because I'm a big fan of Jason and Spinelli. I also enjoy scrubs and any scene with Epiphany because she is one of the best actresses on the daytime show that they fail to utilize. The mystery of who is sabotaging the Hospital is interesting and the ending was a great montage shoot-out that was GH's usual excellent quality. Dr. Drake was great too and the JaRob scenes were a nice touch. Toussaint DuBois as the janitor was really good too.,1260057600,4,528,4.510416666666667
3033267,3,B000YM6DNW,"I would love to have the second season on DVD because it was better and it brought back two legendary characters Robert Scorpio and Anna Devane.
Robert is in a plane crash and is brought to General Hospital, where it is discovered he has developed Colon Cancer. Robin is tormented by this, that her indestructible dad is dying. She calls in Anna Devane, her mom. Anna sits by Robert nearly throughout and their love for each other is rekindled through tears and a lot of emotion.
Second season is worth a DVD release. Please bring it.",1248393600,2,534,4.572916666666667
3033268,5,B000YM6DNW,"I see a lot of people on here didn't like this dvd according to their reviews. Well I thought it was great! It wasn't all mob drama and stuff you see on the daily show, and the whole show actaully takes place IN THE HOSPITAL! That was kind of different from the daily show. I thought it was  WAY more funnier than the regular show. Steve Burton and Bradford Anderson we're finally able to show their comedy sides and definitely made me laugh! If you are a Jason Morgan fan I think you will enjoy this! He is gorgeous in it!!",1244678400,3,524,4.188118811881188
3033269,3,B000YM6DNW,"lets see how frons can piss gh fans off today shall we? I was happy that it wasn't super mob show. There were definitely some really good points to teh season such as Billy Dee Williams's Toussaint and Epiphany were a riot to watch. the music was great(I'm an audiophile music is important to me). you have Steve Burton's Jason actually seeming human. You have spinelli not being obsessed with lulu(Thank God). There's Doctor Lee's sex addiction which was a fun storyline until they made her have a breakdown.

On to the Ranting pissed off part of the review. Which reminds me what the **** happened to Doctor Ford, Doctor Winters, and Cody Paul if this crap bled onto GH? so many storylines between Night Shift and Gh and all the good ones got shafted. We end up with back to back to back Mob storylines. Night Shift was supposed to be an AU. Same characters as were on GH at the time while introducing some new ones and re introducing old ones. The Robin/Patrick relationship was great there wasn't a need to do what they did in this show to them. Patrick and Robin faught all the time, they had adventures like old gh, and major amounts of chemistry.  They broke them up and and have Patricks character jump into a relationship with someone else who you don't see him having any chemistry with at all it was an outrage. Robins Baby Obsessions was like every Other Girl. You see a baby makes you want one. She just never thought she could have one and this women gave her the courage to want to try sometime in her future. one of the few storylines they rushed. Now they're at a turtles pace waiting for someone to discover claudia shot micheal...  They gave up characters like Jolene(she was mid western and nuts and it could of been interesting to see what could happen) and Regina(who was just getting her confidence and had great oppurtunites for character growth and another one that had chemistry with Dr Leo Julian) to spotlight Leyla and then when they do bleed stuff over to GH they don't use them(as you can tell now by the fact that the only time they used her character was when she got shot and was told she is the spitting image of Johnny's mother and also the fact that she's dead now). Dr Leo had this whole chemistry with Maxie Jones Too. We don't see any of that again, and on top of all of that he and Dr. Archer disappeared down the hallway of doom.

lets not touch on season 2 cause then I'll go into a rant on what they did to leo's character(thank god it was a recast that's all I'll say on that)...",1240185600,2,2524,4.386752136752137
3033270,1,B000YM6DNW,"I hated GH: NightShift. No! I dispise GH: NightShift and everything about it, but for the saving grace of Kimberly McCullough ( Robin ). Practicly everything Guza and his crew wrote for Robin, did to Robin and how unattractive tptb attempted to have Robin appear was horrible BUT failed because of Miss McCullough's undeniable talents as an actress. Miss McCullough shines no matter how bad the writing is and delivers no matter how awful the circumstances are. She is a true talent and a real beauty that cannot be denied or tossed aside. Kimberly McCullough( Robin Scorpio ) is a daytime legend, anyone whose grown-up with her and her character can atest to that. Guza and his crew really need to wake up and realize that trying to distroy Robin Scorpio on NightShift or on GH is one of the biggest mistakes he can and will ever make! Her fans and the loyal ""Scrubs"" fans WILL NOT STAND FOR IT. And if he and Frons want the ratings to rise than they should stop trying to hang Robin & Patrick out to dry.",1239753600,4,1006,4.502732240437158
3033271,5,B000YM6DNW,This is a great collection to own.  I am glad that I bought it and hope that there is a series 2.  If so I will be first in line for the collection.,1235692800,2,148,3.4545454545454546

3033283,4,B000YM6DNW,I enjoyed this dvd and it was nice to see a different view of General Hospital.,1215993600,,79,4.0
3033284,5,B000YM6DNW,The Night Shift was one of my favorites on TV... I'm glad that i now own the entire first season on DVD. It's great company for a General Hospital fan. The storyline is not based on the show... but includes some of the same characters which is good. I like though that they interlope it at the end.,1203379200,2,298,4.155172413793103
3033285,5,B000YM6DNW,"As a fan of General Hospital, and of their previous spin-off Port Charles, I was looking forward to the newest series Night Shift.  I loved the drama and angst that came to those who worked on the graveyard shift at the hospital.  I thought the storyline of Cody and Lainey the most enjoyable, and Jason Morgan and Spinelli added comedic relief throughout the series.  Also as a fan of Robin and Patrick, I really enjoyed watching Jason Thompson and Kimberly McCullough do some of their best work in the acting department.  The cameo appearances by some of the other GH cast, like Carolyn Hennesy, Lindze Letherman among others certainly added to the cast integration of this series. To watch and enjoy Billie Dee Williams is icing on the cake.

If you like hospital drama each and every episode, then I would suggest you watch GH:Night Shift.",1202947200,,843,4.7465753424657535
3033286,5,B000YM6DNW,I loved Night Shift.  I thought the writers did a far better job then with the counter part General Hospital.  The stories were written extremely well.  The entire cast was used often and even history from the daytime show (General Hospital) was added to enhance things.  By far my favorite two characters were Jason Morgan and Robin Scorpio.  I found the way the writers really focused on their connection and emotions in regards to one another was great.  There is so much romantic potential there and I hope to see something come of it.,1202860800,3,539,4.680851063829787
3033287,1,B000YM6DNW,"I wouldn't presume to tell anyone else whether or not they should purchase these DVD's but I would like to just present some facts in case you think Nightshift was about Robin and Patrick.  There were 13 hours of Nightshift and Robin and Patrick shared the screen for 43 minutes and 27 seconds.  There were only two scenes where they were happy as a couple.

Episode #1 - Robin and Patrick were on screen together for 10 minutes and 1 second. During that time P. told R. that he didn't need a babysitter, it wasn't flattering to either of them when she was terratorial and he was a superhero and she was a nag.  P. started flirting with nurse.
Episode # 2 - on screen together 2 minutes and 7 seconds.  P. gets a back-rub from nurse and insinuated that R. might want to consider a boob job.
Episode #3 - again, 2 minutes and 7 seconds on screen together.  There is one decent scene where R. and P. discuss parenthood.
Episode #4 - 4 minutes and 29 seconds on screen together.  Patrick joins the nurse in a picket line and P. and R. argue over the HIV+pregnant lady.
Episode #5 - 2 minutes and 58 seconds R. sees P. on roof hugging and dancing with nurse.
Episode #6 - 2 minutes and 51 seconds.  R and P fighting
Episode #7 - 4 minutes and 36 seconds. After HIV+ patient dies, R is upset and crying.  P yells at R that patients die, no matter now much we hate it and if she can't accept that she doesn't belong in medicine the stomps off.
Episode #8 - 3 min 13 seconds.  P tells R she needs Stacys baby because her biological clock is ticking and she is a walking hormore level with an irrational attachment to a baby.
Episode # 9 - 4 min 37 sec. P grabs R by arm and drags her into the stairwell. Tells her the woman he met 1 1/2 years ago is gone because she wants to be a mother.
Episode # 10 - 6 second scene as P just glances at R as he passes her in the hall.
Episode # 11 - 2 minutes 5 seconds.  P tells R that using her position to pick on nurse is petty. Says R is running around the hospital like a 10 year old on a sugar high, has lost her objectivity and has no professionalism.  P says ""Don't punish Leyla because I am sleeping with her.
Episode # 12 - 2 minutes 1 second.  P grabs R. (yet again), pulls her into closet.  Tells her that she should apoligize to him because, unlike the nurse, she wasn't there for him when he needed her.
Episode # 13 - P says he wasn't prepared for R to bond with Stacy and baby but he still cares about her.  R tells him that for someone who was supposed to love, he made no attempt to help or understand her as she dealt with the loss of Stacy and the baby.

In my opinion, Nightshift was not about Robin and Patrick.  After the first episode, there was no indication that Patrick loved Robin and not much indication that she loved him.  This show was about Patrick and the nurse.  The only good to come out of Nightshift was the absolutely amazing acting of Kimberly McCullough.  I would give that 5 stars.",1202342400,13,2954,4.113240418118467
3033288,4,B000YM6DNW,"I will admit that I was skeptical about the show from the start. I am not a fan of the GH characters Patrick and Robin. But I was pleasantly surprised by Night Shift. Each week I was delighted with intrigue, cast integration, lighthearted comedy, and serious tearjerking dramatic moments.

Some of the standouts were Bradford Anderson as Spinelli.

Jason and Spinelli in the elevator. This two part episode was well written and well acted from start to finish.

The entire storyline between Lainey and Cody. Little mentioned but definitely the most moving and  thought provoking storyline of the show.

Billy Dee Williams

I also enjoyed meeting some new doctors and nurses. It was a nice change of pace from the daytime version of General Hospital.

Disgruntled Scrubs fans may be whining that their precious couple faced some setbacks during the series. But I actually found Robin and Patrick must tolerable while on Night Shift. They finally had some real issues to cause strife in their relationship, instead of meaningless fights about what color to paint the kitchen.

All in all, I am excited by the release of this DVD and the opportunity to revisit some memorable moments from the series.",1201824000,6,1197,4.95
3033289,5,B000YM6DNW,"Okay, so first off, I was a little skeptical about how a soap opera would do as a weekly spin off.  I mean, those of you who watched or heard of Port Charles (ummm, that would be the one where there were all the vampires running around), you know that the head honchos don't exactly inspire confidence.

Secondly, I was reluctant to watch a show that would be ""highlighting"" what I considered to be a highly disturbing relationship, that of Patrick and Robin, played by Jason Thompson and Kimberly McCullough.  Throughout the last year and a half we have been subjected to Patrick's continuous and abusive behavior towards Robin all in the name of ""love"" and I just did not feel that this was an appropriate role model for young people.  No, it is not okay for ANYONE, especially someone who claims to love you to belittle you and call you names, no matter what kind of emotional baggage they have.

But I digress.  I watched the first episode and was floored.  Finally, we were getting what we were promised in 2005 when Kimberly McCullough returned to General Hospital after a 7 year absence.  When Kimber returned she kept saying how excited she was to have an opportunity to have scenes with Steve Burton again, but those scenes never materialized on General Hospital.  Oh, but Night Shift is a different creature.  Every episode got better and better.  I was counting down the days until each new episode appeared.  After 18 months of character assassination and ridiculous storylines, the Robin Scorpio that we all know and love made a reappearance.  Gone was the melodramatic, whiny, and hysterical co-dependent Robin and here was independent, strong, kick butt and take names Robin back from virtual death.  In scenes with Steve Burton, KImberly McCullough sparkled onscreen.  Finally, her character of Robin was able to stand up to her playboy of a boyfriend and when he left her for another, she didn't fall apart.  She picked up the pieces and moved on.

The writing was pretty good, there were a couple of things that got lost, but for going from writing a daily show to a weekly, I felt they did pretty well.  It was nice to see some actual hospital drama and have the actors given an opportunity to sink their teeth into something a little meatier than mob wars and bed hopping.  I will definitely be buying this DVD to watch over and over and meanwhile, I'll be praying for a second season.",1201219200,6,2405,4.683333333333334

While I agree that Night Shift was not perfect.  It had some great highs too.  Its worth the 20 dollars just to see Bradford Anderson (Spinelli) it really show cased how great of an actor he is.",1200700800,5,414,7.604166666666667
3033291,4,B000YM6DNW,"My favorite part of GH NIGHT SHIFT came in the middle of the series, during the Stacy storyline, an HIV positive patient, who prepared to give birth to her baby.  With an unexpected and heartbreaking ending to her story,  Kimberly McCullough, (Robin) Bradford Anderson, (Spinelli) Jason Thompson (Patrick) Billy Dee Williams (Touissant) and Steve Burton(Jason) were standout, as was the guest actor who played Stacy.

Another excellent story was between Lainey (Kent King) the psychiatrist and Cody Paul the veteran of Iraq wars, concerning her ailing father with Alzheimers.

Jolene (Amanda Baker) was not as she seemed,  and the ending of her story with Spinelli was also shocking and touching.

Billy Dee Williams sings and dances, in another excellent episode, with standout performance from Sonya Eddy.

The show really had it's moments and in a way, I enjoy GH NIGHT SHIFT even more than I did the regular GH, because of the diverse cast, the focus on hospital and the cast involved.

The big problem for me is that when you watch the regular show, it wasn't adding up, and then in the end, they tried to make it do so with confusing results.",1200441600,8,1148,4.881443298969073

But I Love GH and I did enjoy watching NS just to see what the heck was going to happen next and i really want to see a season 2 ( hopefully) they will learn from season 1 and finally give my couple a good storyline. I also enjoyed the storylines of Lainey/Cody and Kelly and the hunky anetheisologist. i couldn't stand the three student nurses (especially the Leyla character) but I hope for better character development and better storys for the future. But I truthfully have to say even though i disliked what they did to Patrick/Robin I liked the fact that there was a spin off to GH with them in it and that it was their own show.",1198972800,6,797,4.355704697986577

I wish I didn't have the Night Shift stories clouding my brain.  Some of the stories were acknowledged on GH (the Killer Nurse and her sister, Nadine). Others were not acknowledged and were actually impossible on GH at the time (Maxie needs heart procedure, Jason performing community service while he was in prison on GH...).  See other reviews for the Jason/Robin issues.  The only thing worth seeing the series for is the CG skyline.

3033304,1,B000YM6DNW,"I was excited.

Kimberly McCollough - one of the standouts on General Hospital who has successfully portrayed Robin Scorpio for over 20 years; who brought me to tears more than once over the years portraying a sensitive, intelligent daughter of legacy characters Anna and Robert Scorpio - was FINALLY getting her just rewards for being a great actress.

Kim ALWAYS rises to the occassion on a show that once was #1; a show under the direction of Anne Sweeney, Brian Frons, Jill Phelps and Bob Guza turned its back on a legion of not only legacy characters but a legion of legacy fans who loved the romance, the adventure, the friendships and the family bonds to glorify a new type of family.  The Mob Family.

But I was excited.

Jason Thompson - an unknown actor who fast became a breakout star on GH with his portrayal of Patrick Drake, the son of another legacy character - Noah Drake, and helped to create the famous SCRUBS duo.  Jason had the daunting task of being paired with a woman who has always held her own with the ""big guns"" on GH since she was six; who has never had an unsuccessful pairing (Stone and Robin, Jason and Robin) ... I feared he would be toast.

I was wrong.

They took off like wildfire and considering this intelligent, sexy couple is never given the airtime or the storyline the fans feel they deserve - Kim and Jason managed to turn every scene into gold ... and I was hooked...and I wanted more...and GH promised ... we know we don't give them enough airtime ... we know the fans have been patient...we will give your couple its just due - their own show on SoapNet.  Good Times!!!  I couldn't wait.  I knew I would be witnessing something great.

I was wrong....soooo wrong.

My two favorite characters who shined so brightly on GH - were ripped to shreds by episode 3 and by episode 7 I had to force myself to watch the complete character destruction of my favorite couple.

Night Shift was an abomination.  It was a classic bait and switch by Disney and ABC Daytime that I will not soon forget.

If you are lamenting not having SoapNet and think you missed something groundbreaking by General Hospital?  You haven't.

Instead of spending your money on this DVD, I would donate the 20 bucks to the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF) in support of Kimberly McCullough & Jason Thompson.",1197590400,14,2335,4.572115384615385

STEREOTYPES: If you were deluded into thinking that the diversity of the cast would mean something positive going in, raise your hand! Instead, viewers were treated to a 13 weeks course of Stereotypes 101. The writers, of course, forgot to add this rather important disclaimer: these representations are abhorrent and false! Be you Hispanic, black, female, anyone of color really, or boast an iota of social awareness, prepare to be annoyed. From a Latino medical employee's usage of Spanish come-ons, to a 15 year old pregnant Latina girl with her gangster boyfriend and his posse, the nation's largest minority group were hit with the worst representation. The black student nurse once had an abortion, and the series' attempt to bond her with the black Chief of Staff felt more awkward for trying. Then there's the ridiculously over-propped Iranian student nurse throwing herself a manipulative pity party since ""no one likes her because she's different,"" as if, it would seem, the rest of the multicultural hospital staff were all White Anglo-Saxan Protestant supremacists. Way to use diversity as a scapegoat for your own personality deficiencies, Nurse Mir, and trivialize history as a ploy for sympathy. If her portrayer's attempts at sobbing were even moderately mediocre, perhaps I could have felt something for the character other than revulsion. It was far from it. I must however credit Dominic Rains, who, while referencing his character's Iranian heritage, had the talent to showcase diversity as an endearing and beautiful element of a multi-faceted character, and so win Dr. Leo Julian a well-deserved legion of fans.

MISOGYNY: Actresses Noji and King did not disappoint, but their characters' storylines were typical of GH writers. Kelly is a sex addict who gets charged for sexual harassment, never mind the fact that Dr. Patrick Drake was introduced with much the same pattern of behavior. He's a man, so it's normal, right?, whereas with a woman, let's get her to therapy, STAT. Lainey falls for the man who threatens her with a knife, because, once again, it's GH, where violence is sexy and manhandling is a total turn on. O-kay. I adore the characters and portrayers, but both deserved story lines not founded on twisted misogynistic logic. And then the boob job 'jokes.' Um, GH, you're catering to women and with this show, a younger demographic as well. So, just don't.

MISERY: Let's now tackle the greatest flaw with this program, as fellow reviewers have artfully detailed: the central couple. The very pairing that was to and could have provided this show with a sense of warmth, heart, and rootability was dismantled almost right off the bat, with the XY portion reduced to a walking personification of his own genitalia, stripped entirely of any sensitivity or basic human decency toward the woman he claimed to love. Dr. Patrick Drake was, in my eyes, reduced to a condescending, disrespectful, hypocritical manwhore, whose very presence on screen, even when not engaged in euphemistically ""extracurricular"" activities, was for me intolerable. The XX portion of this could-be golden couple, didn't fare much better, as Dr. Robin Scorpio was a living portrait of misery, spending her weeks without any voice of self-defense as she was continually forced to walk in on her boyfriend's flirtatious antics with a character whose charisma rivals that of a piece of cardboard. Robin then sets aside her medical degree to at one point turn into a baby-crazed zombie, because as misogynistic GH reminds us, it's utterly impossible for a woman to have a successful career and a successful family life. Al-righty then... duly noted.

It is truly a credit to Kimberly McCullough's all-around fantastic-ness that she took the mediocre writing and motivation for her character and still turned in such consistently intense and heart-wrenching performances. She made me feel for a Robin that I at times did not recognize, but through McCullough's Emmy award winning talent, I loved and cried for her still. Wonderful.

As audiences go, I don't think those of us watching Night Shift were really that hard to please. We just wanted some of our favorite soap characters and actors, who are routinely sidestepped on regular GH, to be given the time and platform to shine. As management goes, those in charge proved how little in tune they are with their audience. While we in fact applaud them for their efforts to create a channel for soaps to continue to thrive, we insist that they have done themselves a disservice by so brazenly manipulating and ignoring the desires of their audience. Viewers felt lied to by advertisements, which, besides promoting the very couple that a large portion of the viewership (initially) tuned in to see and soon thereafter dismantling them beyond rootable repair, promised stand-alone episodes, several medical cases, and edgier and racier couplings. They did not deliver, and in some cases, even offended in attempt.

Logistically and substantially, this series was a sloppy mess. The editing was difficult to follow; storylines and characters were dropped without a word as the season went along. Viewers are more than willing to suspend disbelief, but we do ask in return to not be given migraines and cold sweats by the sheer lack of believable organization and overabundance of unsavory plotlines. If the writers had devoted their talents and yes, I understand limited time, to sensible, dramatic storytelling instead of resorting to cheap sensationalist antics, so many flaws would have been forgiven and overlooked by an eagerly awaiting audience. As it is: they did not.

In the end, it's your call. If this series taught me anything, it was to respect myself as a consumer more and refuse to reward those who respect me so little. I'd suggest saving your money, and checking out YouTube as an outlet for curiosity or for the few moments worth watching. My respect for the actors involved remains intact, but this series was a major disappointment.",1197504000,12,6065,5.1140262361251265
3033306,3,B000YM6DNW,"I am a long time Robin fan from the soap General Hospital and the character of Robin is very underused on that show, so this was a great opportunity (despite some stilted writing) for her to showcase her talents.  No this isn't the show for fans looking for romance you'd have to purchase this if you solely want to view intense scenes with great acting from Kimberly McCullough and a few others who had moments of good work such as Kent Masters amoung others.  For those that have watched the Robin character long before Patrick was even on canvas it was nice to see her pick up a friendship with old lover Jason Morgan played by Steve Burton (since the show GH chooses to ignore they ever knew each other) and watch her character struggle with personal choices that included having break downs as cases get too close to her heart.  For those reasons alone it was an interesting show to watch.  The rest as others stated might be a bit flat and I wouldn't really be interested at all if it wasn't for Kimberly's talent.",1197331200,7,1020,4.467741935483871
3033307,1,B000YM6DNW,"It's interesting to read these reviews and have all of the terrible feelings that this series created in me all come floating back to the surface.  I love Robin.  I love GH Patrick, but I HATE the freakin' General Hospital Night Shift.  I'm actually an RN that works the night shift, and I am just really greatful that I do not work at General Hospital!",1197331200,8,353,4.4
3033308,1,B000YM6DNW,"I totally agree with everything the previous reviewers said.  This DVD is not worth your money, put you're $20.99 to better use such as having your teeth pulled without novacaine.  Scrubs fans were lured into watching and supporting this show under the guise that it would revolve around the love story of General Hospital legacy character Robin Scorpio and her boyfriend Patrick Drake who have a huge fan base but receive little air time on GH so naturally Scrubs fans were salivating at the opportunity to see a series revolving around this couple rather than the same old tired GH Mob dominated storylines.  Instead we discovered after the first first few episodes that talentless head writer Bob Guza duped us into watching this garbage that featured the descruction of Scrubs relationship all in the name of propping Guza's newest pet student nurse ""Leyla"".  Thankfully Guza was made to look like a fool since even non-Scrubs fans have failed to support the character of Leyla and Guza's misguided attempt to pair her with Patrick.

The only bright spot in this horrible series is the ability of underused GH regulars Kimberly McCullough (Robin), Jason Thompson (Patrick), Kent King (Lainey) and newcomer Dominic Raines (Leo) to continue to deliver top notch acting despite the awful writing/scripts they are forced to draw from.

If you are thinking of buying this series to see Scrubs love scenes and growth of their relationship then save your money and watch the first 30 seconds of the first episode on You Tube because it's all downhill after that.  If it were possible to give zero or negative stars on this review I would.",1197244800,18,1635,4.923636363636364
3033309,1,B000YM6DNW,"Last spring, Brian Frons, head of ABC Daytime, was touting an upcoming prime-time spinoff of General Hospital, called General Hospital: Night Shift. He and others were all smiles, saying as how the mob-obsessed head writer, Robert Guza, Jr., did not have the ""time"" to tell the story of Patrick and Robin on GH, that GH: NS would do so, focusing on their romantic relationship.

Too bad he and everyone else lied.

Instead, what the viewers got was complete character destruction and the assassination of the very couple used in the ads to draw the suckers...er, viewers...in. We had thirteen weeks of a show used to glorify the non-existent charisma of character Student Nurse Leyla Mir - a nurse whose only redeeming characteristic was looking as if she stepped out of an '80s beauty pageant - all while either killing pregnant women by neglect and managing to be rewarded for her screw ups, but I digress.

The viewers who were promised focus on the ""Scrubs"" (Patrick/Robin) relationship instead saw Patrick stripped of any tenderness, humor, and empathy - most especially apparent with the character of Robin - and turned into a jackass of monumental proportions. It is a testament of Jason Thompson's skill that Patrick and Robin are still root-for on GH, the main show, as had everyone seen this, I'm not so sure that would be the case. Thank God for his chemistry with Kimberly McCullough, which, naturally, made the lack of chemistry with Leyla that much more appalling. So, naturally, we had ""Scrubs"" break up and had the chemistry-free pairing of Patrick/Leyla dominate for about eight of the thirteen weeks. Never mind the pesky commercials promoting ""Scrubs"" up to the very end. Force feeding was the name of the game.

Speaking of Kimberly McCullough, she also deserves major kudos and combat pay of her own for managing to still make Robin sympathetic in the face of Bob Guza and Company trying to make her into a baby-obsessed shrew over a patient she knew for five minutes. No doubt this was done to try and make Patrick's choice to turn to the other woman sympathetic, but as much of everything else this regime tries, it failed. There is a reason Miss McCullough has two Daytime Emmys to her name, turning crap into gold.

And do not get me started on the waste of talent of Billy Dee Williams, whose character's sole mission was to mop floors while giving ""sage"" advice to the masses, including hitman-turned-janitor Jason Morgan.

The sole high points of the supporting cast include Kent King, Minae Noji, and Dominic Rains. If GH were still about the hospital, they would no doubt be welcome additions on a more regular basis, instead of token extras that they sadly are. (Thus showing contracts mean squat if you're not in the mob. Ask Kent King, one of the three who does have a contract. Surprised? Thought so.)

However, those few good supporting actors and the talent of Mr. Thompson (who truly got the raw end of the deal here) and Miss McCullough (that is where the one star comes in; if there was a way to put none, I would have!) was wasted on a project that gave new meaning to the term, ""bait and switch"". And it is a shame, as had the show delivered what it had promised - romance with Patrick/Robin and medical stories - of which there were few - this DVD may have had a chance of succeeding.

As it is, you're better off spending your money on a show that is actually entertaining and enjoyable and not some exercise in futility, frustration, disappointment, and pain.",1197244800,39,3503,4.731147540983606
3033310,2,B000YM6DNW,"Unless you feel the strange need to be tortured or nauseated, I would pass on this one. Worst 13 hours I have ever wasted on a television show, period. I have never been more disappointed in a viewing experience in over 25 years of watching soaps. This show was just BAD, on every level. Poorly written shows that made no sense, continued hero worship of the mobster hitman character, weird editing, atrocious acting by newbie cast members, in particular the open at all hours nurse, Leyla. Disjointed ""plots"", lame stories, go nowhere and dropped plotlines, and stupid music choices permeated each show. I believe it's only claim to fame is that it was mocked on ""The Soup"" on E!

If you're in the market for annoying clowns, insulting boob jokes, ridiculous rooftop dancing with the hospital staff re-enacting the cafeteria scene from ""Fame"", the constant humiliation and belittling of a beloved, long time heroine, the wasted talents of Mr. Billy Dee Williams, as well as an ample serving of a forced, contrived, and vomit inducing ""pairing"" of the ""hot"" (not deserved for this character on NS) neurosurgeon and his predatory stalker student nurse, as well as racial stereotypes and mocking of serious social issues such as abortion, sex addictions, and HIV, then HEY!! this show IS for you!

The only bright spot in the entire series was the performance of Kimberly McCullough as Dr. Robin Scorpio. This two-time Emmy winner managed to rise above the shoddy material she was given to work with, and still make you feel for her character's plight, as she continued to get dumped on more and more with each episode. I love Jason Thompson as Dr. Patrick Drake on GH, but his character was totally destroyed and unrecognizable on Night Shift. He's a fantastic actor, but NO ONE could have risen above how his character was being written, with no character motivation and point of view. Add to that a chemistry-free, awkward, and unwanted new ""romance"" (gag), and the writing was on the wall for his character.

Night Shift was marketed as a vehicle featuring the popular pairing of Robin and Patrick on GH. See them there, on the cover? Aren't they pretty? The producers, head writer and president of the network admitted that they basically had given this couple no airtime or story, despite overwhelming fan response. Fans were baited with promises of romance, hospital drama, sex scenes, and Robin and Patrick front and center. Well, except for a blink-and-you-miss-it 20 second shower scene, none of those things happened. There was some of the most passionless ""sex"" scenes I've ever seen between Patrick and another character, while Robin was left crying, alone and devastated, on the rooftop. There was an intense medical drama with an HIV+ expectant mother, in which the doctors were of no consequence whatsoever, since the hallowed hitman and his hacker sidekick were there to save the day. There was a dramatic shoot out in the ER, with...guess who? The hitman ""hero"" to the rescue yet again.

Somehow Night Shift managed to be even more offensive and less about the hospital than General Hospital is on a daily basis. That is certainly not a glowing review.

Basically, Night Shift was a nightmare. It certainly gave me many of them. Along with headaches, night tremors, and insomnia (Can't sleep. Might flash to gag worthy gurney sex scenes)<Shudders> I need medication just to forget this disaster ever happened.

Sorry Kimberly and Jason, no amount of cute behind the scenes special features are worth this torture. I know it wasn't your fault, but NS is the... WORST. SHOW. EVER. :(",1197244800,7,3597,4.927392739273928
3033311,1,B000YM6DNW,"I went in so excited for this show, that was supposed to revolve around my favorite daytime couple, Patrick Drake  and Robin Scropio, but was instantly dissappointed. It depicted them as totally different character and the story change half way through was a disasterious idea. The forced pairing of ""nurse"" Leyla and Patrick was nausiating and lacking in any chemistry. It was so horrible i stopped watching after acouple episodes.",1197158400,21,432,5.171428571428572
3033312,1,B000YM6DNW,"This was a waste of time. I went into it believing it would be about something and was left disappointed. Bob Guza (head writer) and Brian Frons (pres of ABC) basically pulled a bait and switch on fans. They said it would be about the popular couple Patrick and Robin and that this show wouldn't carry over to the original soap, General Hospital. On NS, it didn't seem like Patrick and Robin (Scrubs) even liked each other. And a lot of the stories did carry over, so that in fact it wasn't an alternative universe that was promised.

Whether you were a previous GH watcher or a new watcher all together, this series will leave you confused with its inconsistencies, bad editing, and lame writing. To be fair there were some highlights, but they didn't outweigh the bad.

The Bad:
- The non-chemistry filled ""relationship"" between Patrick and nurse Leyla, played by an actress with the screen presence and acting ability of a paper bag.
- The lack of screen time of the vixen you can't help but love, Maxie Jones (played brilliantly by Kristin Storms)
- The writing and editing.
- The lack of relationship development between Patrick and Robin.
- The confusing ending. Not worth it.
- The character destruction of Patrick Drake.

The Highlights:
- Actresses like Minae Noji and Kent King who were given the chance to show what they were capable of.
- New finds like the charismatic and talented Dominic Rains.
- When they highlighted Billy Dee Williams in more than just mopping the floor.
- The acting from Kimberly McCullough. There is a reason this woman is a two time Emmy award winner. Despite the crappy writing and the obsessive baby desires of her character, you just felt for her and cried along with her when the world was crumbling before her.
- Other note worthy performances where Bradford Anderson and Steve Burton.

What promised to be a riveting series, turned out to be a complete let down. If you want to see a love story, because we are all suckers for a good love story, this is definitely not the show. You want good writing and decent storytelling. Also not the show. I would only buy this DVD if by some miracle it was a different series all together. Since it's not, save yourself the disappointment and money. Mr. Bob Guza thanks for nothing. You do not know the fans at all.",1196985600,34,2300,4.602439024390244

There were definitely some really good points to teh season such as Billy Dee Williams's Toussaint and Epiphany were a riot to watch. the music was great(I'm an audiophile music is important to me). you have Steve Burton's Jason actually seeming human. You have spinelli not being obsessed with lulu(Thank God). There's Doctor Lee's sex addiction which was a fun storyline until they made her have a breakdown.

On to the Ranting pissed off part of the review. Which reminds me what the **** happened to Doctor Ford, Doctor Winters, and Cody Paul if this crap bled onto GH? so many storylines between Night Shift and Gh and all the good ones got shafted. We end up with back to back to back Mob storylines. Night Shift was supposed to be an AU. Same characters as were on GH at the time while introducing some new ones and re introducing old ones. The Robin/Patrick relationship was great there wasn't a need to do what they did in this show to them. Patrick and Robin faught all the time, they had adventures like old gh, and major amounts of chemistry.  They broke them up and and have Patricks character jump into a relationship with someone else who you don't see him having any chemistry with at all it was an outrage. Robins Baby Obsessions was like every Other Girl. You see a baby makes you want one. She just never thought she could have one and this women gave her the courage to want to try sometime in her future. one of the few storylines they rushed. Now they're at a turtles pace waiting for someone to discover claudia shot micheal...  They gave up characters like Jolene(she was mid western and nuts and it could of been interesting to see what could happen) and Regina(who was just getting her confidence and had great oppurtunites for character growth and another one that had chemistry with Dr Leo Julian) to spotlight Leyla and then when they do bleed stuff over to GH they don't use them(as you can tell now by the fact that the only time they used her character was when she got shot and was told she is the spitting image of Johnny's mother and also the fact that she's dead now). Dr Leo had this whole chemistry with Maxie Jones Too. We don't see any of that again, and on top of all of that he and Dr. Archer disappeared down the hallway of doom.

lets not touch on season 2 cause then I'll go into a rant on what they did to leo's character(thank god it was a recast that's all I'll say on that)...",1240185600,2,2524,4.386752136752137

Practicly everything Guza and his crew wrote for Robin, did to Robin and how unattractive tptb attempted to have Robin appear was horrible BUT failed because of Miss McCullough's undeniable talents as an actress. Miss McCullough shines no matter how bad the writing is and delivers no matter how awful the circumstances are. She is a true talent and a real beauty that cannot be denied or tossed aside. Kimberly McCullough( Robin Scorpio ) is a daytime legend, anyone whose grown-up with her and her character can atest to that. Guza and his crew really need to wake up and realize that trying to distroy Robin Scorpio on NightShift or on GH is one of the biggest mistakes he can and will ever make!

3267782,5,B000YM6DNW,"As a fan of General Hospital, and of their previous spin-off Port Charles, I was looking forward to the newest series Night Shift.  I loved the drama and angst that came to those who worked on the graveyard shift at the hospital.  I thought the storyline of Cody and Lainey the most enjoyable, and Jason Morgan and Spinelli added comedic relief throughout the series.  Also as a fan of Robin and Patrick, I really enjoyed watching Jason Thompson and Kimberly McCullough do some of their best work in the acting department.  The cameo appearances by some of the other GH cast, like Carolyn Hennesy, Lindze Letherman among others certainly added to the cast integration of this series. To watch and enjoy Billie Dee Williams is icing on the cake.

3267783,5,B000YM6DNW,I loved Night Shift.  I thought the writers did a far better job then with the counter part General Hospital.  The stories were written extremely well.  The entire cast was used often and even history from the daytime show (General Hospital) was added to enhance things.  By far my favorite two characters were Jason Morgan and Robin Scorpio.  I found the way the writers really focused on their connection and emotions in regards to one another was great.  There is so much romantic potential there and I hope to see something come of it.,1202860800,3,539,4.680851063829787
3267784,1,B000YM6DNW,"I wouldn't presume to tell anyone else whether or not they should purchase these DVD's but I would like to just present some facts in case you think Nightshift was about Robin and Patrick.  There were 13 hours of Nightshift and Robin and Patrick shared the screen for 43 minutes and 27 seconds.  There were only two scenes where they were happy as a couple.

Episode #1 - Robin and Patrick were on screen together for 10 minutes and 1 second. During that time P. told R. that he didn't need a babysitter, it wasn't flattering to either of them when she was terratorial and he was a superhero and she was a nag.  P. started flirting with nurse.
Episode # 2 - on screen together 2 minutes and 7 seconds.  P. gets a back-rub from nurse and insinuated that R. might want to consider a boob job.
Episode #3 - again, 2 minutes and 7 seconds on screen together.  There is one decent scene where R. and P. discuss parenthood.
Episode #4 - 4 minutes and 29 seconds on screen together.  Patrick joins the nurse in a picket line and P. and R. argue over the HIV+pregnant lady.
Episode #5 - 2 minutes and 58 seconds R. sees P. on roof hugging and dancing with nurse.
Episode #6 - 2 minutes and 51 seconds.  R and P fighting
Episode #7 - 4 minutes and 36 seconds. After HIV+ patient dies, R is upset and crying.  P yells at R that patients die, no matter now much we hate it and if she can't accept that she doesn't belong in medicine the stomps off.
Episode #8 - 3 min 13 seconds.  P tells R she needs Stacys baby because her biological clock is ticking and she is a walking hormore level with an irrational attachment to a baby.
Episode # 9 - 4 min 37 sec. P grabs R by arm and drags her into the stairwell. Tells her the woman he met 1 1/2 years ago is gone because she wants to be a mother.
Episode # 10 - 6 second scene as P just glances at R as he passes her in the hall.
Episode # 11 - 2 minutes 5 seconds.  P tells R that using her position to pick on nurse is petty. Says R is running around the hospital like a 10 year old on a sugar high, has lost her objectivity and has no professionalism.  P says ""Don't punish Leyla because I am sleeping with her.
Episode # 12 - 2 minutes 1 second.  P grabs R. (yet again), pulls her into closet.  Tells her that she should apoligize to him because, unlike the nurse, she wasn't there for him when he needed her.
Episode # 13 - P says he wasn't prepared for R to bond with Stacy and baby but he still cares about her.  R tells him that for someone who was supposed to love, he made no attempt to help or understand her as she dealt with the loss of Stacy and the baby.

In my opinion, Nightshift was not about Robin and Patrick.  After the first episode, there was no indication that Patrick loved Robin and not much indication that she loved him.  This show was about Patrick and the nurse.  The only good to come out of Nightshift was the absolutely amazing acting of Kimberly McCullough.  I would give that 5 stars.",1202342400,13,2954,4.113240418118467
3267785,4,B000YM6DNW,"I will admit that I was skeptical about the show from the start. I am not a fan of the GH characters Patrick and Robin. But I was pleasantly surprised by Night Shift. Each week I was delighted with intrigue, cast integration, lighthearted comedy, and serious tearjerking dramatic moments.

Some of the standouts were Bradford Anderson as Spinelli.

Jason and Spinelli in the elevator. This two part episode was well written and well acted from start to finish.

The entire storyline between Lainey and Cody. Little mentioned but definitely the most moving and  thought provoking storyline of the show.

Billy Dee Williams

I also enjoyed meeting some new doctors and nurses. It was a nice change of pace from the daytime version of General Hospital.

Disgruntled Scrubs fans may be whining that their precious couple faced some setbacks during the series. But I actually found Robin and Patrick must tolerable while on Night Shift. They finally had some real issues to cause strife in their relationship, instead of meaningless fights about what color to paint the kitchen.

All in all, I am excited by the release of this DVD and the opportunity to revisit some memorable moments from the series.",1201824000,6,1197,4.95
3267786,5,B000YM6DNW,"Okay, so first off, I was a little skeptical about how a soap opera would do as a weekly spin off.  I mean, those of you who watched or heard of Port Charles (ummm, that would be the one where there were all the vampires running around), you know that the head honchos don't exactly inspire confidence.

Secondly, I was reluctant to watch a show that would be ""highlighting"" what I considered to be a highly disturbing relationship, that of Patrick and Robin, played by Jason Thompson and Kimberly McCullough.  Throughout the last year and a half we have been subjected to Patrick's continuous and abusive behavior towards Robin all in the name of ""love"" and I just did not feel that this was an appropriate role model for young people.  No, it is not okay for ANYONE, especially someone who claims to love you to belittle you and call you names, no matter what kind of emotional baggage they have.

But I digress.  I watched the first episode and was floored.  Finally, we were getting what we were promised in 2005 when Kimberly McCullough returned to General Hospital after a 7 year absence.  When Kimber returned she kept saying how excited she was to have an opportunity to have scenes with Steve Burton again, but those scenes never materialized on General Hospital.  Oh, but Night Shift is a different creature.  Every episode got better and better.  I was counting down the days until each new episode appeared.  After 18 months of character assassination and ridiculous storylines, the Robin Scorpio that we all know and love made a reappearance.  Gone was the melodramatic, whiny, and hysterical co-dependent Robin and here was independent, strong, kick butt and take names Robin back from virtual death.  In scenes with Steve Burton, KImberly McCullough sparkled onscreen.  Finally, her character of Robin was able to stand up to her playboy of a boyfriend and when he left her for another, she didn't fall apart.  She picked up the pieces and moved on.

The writing was pretty good, there were a couple of things that got lost, but for going from writing a daily show to a weekly, I felt they did pretty well.  It was nice to see some actual hospital drama and have the actors given an opportunity to sink their teeth into something a little meatier than mob wars and bed hopping.  I will definitely be buying this DVD to watch over and over and meanwhile, I'll be praying for a second season.",1201219200,6,2405,4.683333333333334

3267788,4,B000YM6DNW,"My favorite part of GH NIGHT SHIFT came in the middle of the series, during the Stacy storyline, an HIV positive patient, who prepared to give birth to her baby.  With an unexpected and heartbreaking ending to her story,  Kimberly McCullough, (Robin) Bradford Anderson, (Spinelli) Jason Thompson (Patrick) Billy Dee Williams (Touissant) and Steve Burton(Jason) were standout, as was the guest actor who played Stacy.

Another excellent story was between Lainey (Kent King) the psychiatrist and Cody Paul the veteran of Iraq wars, concerning her ailing father with Alzheimers.

Jolene (Amanda Baker) was not as she seemed,  and the ending of her story with Spinelli was also shocking and touching.

Billy Dee Williams sings and dances, in another excellent episode, with standout performance from Sonya Eddy.

The show really had it's moments and in a way, I enjoy GH NIGHT SHIFT even more than I did the regular GH, because of the diverse cast, the focus on hospital and the cast involved.

The big problem for me is that when you watch the regular show, it wasn't adding up, and then in the end, they tried to make it do so with confusing results.",1200441600,8,1148,4.881443298969073

3267801,1,B000YM6DNW,"I was excited.

Kimberly McCollough - one of the standouts on General Hospital who has successfully portrayed Robin Scorpio for over 20 years; who brought me to tears more than once over the years portraying a sensitive, intelligent daughter of legacy characters Anna and Robert Scorpio - was FINALLY getting her just rewards for being a great actress.

Kim ALWAYS rises to the occassion on a show that once was #1; a show under the direction of Anne Sweeney, Brian Frons, Jill Phelps and Bob Guza turned its back on a legion of not only legacy characters but a legion of legacy fans who loved the romance, the adventure, the friendships and the family bonds to glorify a new type of family.  The Mob Family.

But I was excited.

Jason Thompson - an unknown actor who fast became a breakout star on GH with his portrayal of Patrick Drake, the son of another legacy character - Noah Drake, and helped to create the famous SCRUBS duo.  Jason had the daunting task of being paired with a woman who has always held her own with the ""big guns"" on GH since she was six; who has never had an unsuccessful pairing (Stone and Robin, Jason and Robin) ... I feared he would be toast.

I was wrong.

They took off like wildfire and considering this intelligent, sexy couple is never given the airtime or the storyline the fans feel they deserve - Kim and Jason managed to turn every scene into gold ... and I was hooked...and I wanted more...and GH promised ... we know we don't give them enough airtime ... we know the fans have been patient...we will give your couple its just due - their own show on SoapNet.  Good Times!!!  I couldn't wait.  I knew I would be witnessing something great.

I was wrong....soooo wrong.

My two favorite characters who shined so brightly on GH - were ripped to shreds by episode 3 and by episode 7 I had to force myself to watch the complete character destruction of my favorite couple.

Night Shift was an abomination.  It was a classic bait and switch by Disney and ABC Daytime that I will not soon forget.

If you are lamenting not having SoapNet and think you missed something groundbreaking by General Hospital?  You haven't.

Instead of spending your money on this DVD, I would donate the 20 bucks to the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF) in support of Kimberly McCullough & Jason Thompson.",1197590400,14,2335,4.572115384615385
3267802,1,B000YM6DNW,"General Hospital: Night Shift.
Let's dissect, shall we?

STEREOTYPES: If you were deluded into thinking that the diversity of the cast would mean something positive going in, raise your hand! Instead, viewers were treated to a 13 weeks course of Stereotypes 101. The writers, of course, forgot to add this rather important disclaimer: these representations are abhorrent and false! Be you Hispanic, black, female, anyone of color really, or boast an iota of social awareness, prepare to be annoyed. From a Latino medical employee's usage of Spanish come-ons, to a 15 year old pregnant Latina girl with her gangster boyfriend and his posse, the nation's largest minority group were hit with the worst representation. The black student nurse once had an abortion, and the series' attempt to bond her with the black Chief of Staff felt more awkward for trying. Then there's the ridiculously over-propped Iranian student nurse throwing herself a manipulative pity party since ""no one likes her because she's different,"" as if, it would seem, the rest of the multicultural hospital staff were all White Anglo-Saxan Protestant supremacists. Way to use diversity as a scapegoat for your own personality deficiencies, Nurse Mir, and trivialize history as a ploy for sympathy. If her portrayer's attempts at sobbing were even moderately mediocre, perhaps I could have felt something for the character other than revulsion. It was far from it. I must however credit Dominic Rains, who, while referencing his character's Iranian heritage, had the talent to showcase diversity as an endearing and beautiful element of a multi-faceted character, and so win Dr. Leo Julian a well-deserved legion of fans.

MISOGYNY: Actresses Noji and King did not disappoint, but their characters' storylines were typical of GH writers. Kelly is a sex addict who gets charged for sexual harassment, never mind the fact that Dr. Patrick Drake was introduced with much the same pattern of behavior. He's a man, so it's normal, right?, whereas with a woman, let's get her to therapy, STAT. Lainey falls for the man who threatens her with a knife, because, once again, it's GH, where violence is sexy and manhandling is a total turn on. O-kay. I adore the characters and portrayers, but both deserved story lines not founded on twisted misogynistic logic. And then the boob job 'jokes.' Um, GH, you're catering to women and with this show, a younger demographic as well. So, just don't.

MISERY: Let's now tackle the greatest flaw with this program, as fellow reviewers have artfully detailed: the central couple. The very pairing that was to and could have provided this show with a sense of warmth, heart, and rootability was dismantled almost right off the bat, with the XY portion reduced to a walking personification of his own genitalia, stripped entirely of any sensitivity or basic human decency toward the woman he claimed to love. Dr. Patrick Drake was, in my eyes, reduced to a condescending, disrespectful, hypocritical manwhore, whose very presence on screen, even when not engaged in euphemistically ""extracurricular"" activities, was for me intolerable. The XX portion of this could-be golden couple, didn't fare much better, as Dr. Robin Scorpio was a living portrait of misery, spending her weeks without any voice of self-defense as she was continually forced to walk in on her boyfriend's flirtatious antics with a character whose charisma rivals that of a piece of cardboard. Robin then sets aside her medical degree to at one point turn into a baby-crazed zombie, because as misogynistic GH reminds us, it's utterly impossible for a woman to have a successful career and a successful family life. Al-righty then... duly noted.

It is truly a credit to Kimberly McCullough's all-around fantastic-ness that she took the mediocre writing and motivation for her character and still turned in such consistently intense and heart-wrenching performances. She made me feel for a Robin that I at times did not recognize, but through McCullough's Emmy award winning talent, I loved and cried for her still. Wonderful.

As audiences go, I don't think those of us watching Night Shift were really that hard to please. We just wanted some of our favorite soap characters and actors, who are routinely sidestepped on regular GH, to be given the time and platform to shine. As management goes, those in charge proved how little in tune they are with their audience. While we in fact applaud them for their efforts to create a channel for soaps to continue to thrive, we insist that they have done themselves a disservice by so brazenly manipulating and ignoring the desires of their audience. Viewers felt lied to by advertisements, which, besides promoting the very couple that a large portion of the viewership (initially) tuned in to see and soon thereafter dismantling them beyond rootable repair, promised stand-alone episodes, several medical cases, and edgier and racier couplings. They did not deliver, and in some cases, even offended in attempt.

Logistically and substantially, this series was a sloppy mess. The editing was difficult to follow; storylines and characters were dropped without a word as the season went along. Viewers are more than willing to suspend disbelief, but we do ask in return to not be given migraines and cold sweats by the sheer lack of believable organization and overabundance of unsavory plotlines. If the writers had devoted their talents and yes, I understand limited time, to sensible, dramatic storytelling instead of resorting to cheap sensationalist antics, so many flaws would have been forgiven and overlooked by an eagerly awaiting audience. As it is: they did not.

In the end, it's your call. If this series taught me anything, it was to respect myself as a consumer more and refuse to reward those who respect me so little. I'd suggest saving your money, and checking out YouTube as an outlet for curiosity or for the few moments worth watching. My respect for the actors involved remains intact, but this series was a major disappointment.",1197504000,12,6065,5.1140262361251265
3267803,3,B000YM6DNW,"I am a long time Robin fan from the soap General Hospital and the character of Robin is very underused on that show, so this was a great opportunity (despite some stilted writing) for her to showcase her talents.  No this isn't the show for fans looking for romance you'd have to purchase this if you solely want to view intense scenes with great acting from Kimberly McCullough and a few others who had moments of good work such as Kent Masters amoung others.  For those that have watched the Robin character long before Patrick was even on canvas it was nice to see her pick up a friendship with old lover Jason Morgan played by Steve Burton (since the show GH chooses to ignore they ever knew each other) and watch her character struggle with personal choices that included having break downs as cases get too close to her heart.  For those reasons alone it was an interesting show to watch.  The rest as others stated might be a bit flat and I wouldn't really be interested at all if it wasn't for Kimberly's talent.",1197331200,7,1020,4.467741935483871

3267805,1,B000YM6DNW,"I totally agree with everything the previous reviewers said.  This DVD is not worth your money, put you're $20.99 to better use such as having your teeth pulled without novacaine.  Scrubs fans were lured into watching and supporting this show under the guise that it would revolve around the love story of General Hospital legacy character Robin Scorpio and her boyfriend Patrick Drake who have a huge fan base but receive little air time on GH so naturally Scrubs fans were salivating at the opportunity to see a series revolving around this couple rather than the same old tired GH Mob dominated storylines.  Instead we discovered after the first first few episodes that talentless head writer Bob Guza duped us into watching this garbage that featured the descruction of Scrubs relationship all in the name of propping Guza's newest pet student nurse ""Leyla"".  Thankfully Guza was made to look like a fool since even non-Scrubs fans have failed to support the character of Leyla and Guza's misguided attempt to pair her with Patrick.

The only bright spot in this horrible series is the ability of underused GH regulars Kimberly McCullough (Robin), Jason Thompson (Patrick), Kent King (Lainey) and newcomer Dominic Raines (Leo) to continue to deliver top notch acting despite the awful writing/scripts they are forced to draw from.

If you are thinking of buying this series to see Scrubs love scenes and growth of their relationship then save your money and watch the first 30 seconds of the first episode on You Tube because it's all downhill after that.  If it were possible to give zero or negative stars on this review I would.",1197244800,18,1635,4.923636363636364
3267806,1,B000YM6DNW,"Last spring, Brian Frons, head of ABC Daytime, was touting an upcoming prime-time spinoff of General Hospital, called General Hospital: Night Shift. He and others were all smiles, saying as how the mob-obsessed head writer, Robert Guza, Jr., did not have the ""time"" to tell the story of Patrick and Robin on GH, that GH: NS would do so, focusing on their romantic relationship.

Too bad he and everyone else lied.

Instead, what the viewers got was complete character destruction and the assassination of the very couple used in the ads to draw the suckers...er, viewers...in. We had thirteen weeks of a show used to glorify the non-existent charisma of character Student Nurse Leyla Mir - a nurse whose only redeeming characteristic was looking as if she stepped out of an '80s beauty pageant - all while either killing pregnant women by neglect and managing to be rewarded for her screw ups, but I digress.

The viewers who were promised focus on the ""Scrubs"" (Patrick/Robin) relationship instead saw Patrick stripped of any tenderness, humor, and empathy - most especially apparent with the character of Robin - and turned into a jackass of monumental proportions. It is a testament of Jason Thompson's skill that Patrick and Robin are still root-for on GH, the main show, as had everyone seen this, I'm not so sure that would be the case. Thank God for his chemistry with Kimberly McCullough, which, naturally, made the lack of chemistry with Leyla that much more appalling. So, naturally, we had ""Scrubs"" break up and had the chemistry-free pairing of Patrick/Leyla dominate for about eight of the thirteen weeks. Never mind the pesky commercials promoting ""Scrubs"" up to the very end. Force feeding was the name of the game.

Speaking of Kimberly McCullough, she also deserves major kudos and combat pay of her own for managing to still make Robin sympathetic in the face of Bob Guza and Company trying to make her into a baby-obsessed shrew over a patient she knew for five minutes. No doubt this was done to try and make Patrick's choice to turn to the other woman sympathetic, but as much of everything else this regime tries, it failed. There is a reason Miss McCullough has two Daytime Emmys to her name, turning crap into gold.

And do not get me started on the waste of talent of Billy Dee Williams, whose character's sole mission was to mop floors while giving ""sage"" advice to the masses, including hitman-turned-janitor Jason Morgan.

The sole high points of the supporting cast include Kent King, Minae Noji, and Dominic Rains. If GH were still about the hospital, they would no doubt be welcome additions on a more regular basis, instead of token extras that they sadly are. (Thus showing contracts mean squat if you're not in the mob. Ask Kent King, one of the three who does have a contract. Surprised? Thought so.)

However, those few good supporting actors and the talent of Mr. Thompson (who truly got the raw end of the deal here) and Miss McCullough (that is where the one star comes in; if there was a way to put none, I would have!) was wasted on a project that gave new meaning to the term, ""bait and switch"". And it is a shame, as had the show delivered what it had promised - romance with Patrick/Robin and medical stories - of which there were few - this DVD may have had a chance of succeeding.

As it is, you're better off spending your money on a show that is actually entertaining and enjoyable and not some exercise in futility, frustration, disappointment, and pain.",1197244800,39,3503,4.731147540983606
3267807,2,B000YM6DNW,"Unless you feel the strange need to be tortured or nauseated, I would pass on this one. Worst 13 hours I have ever wasted on a television show, period. I have never been more disappointed in a viewing experience in over 25 years of watching soaps. This show was just BAD, on every level. Poorly written shows that made no sense, continued hero worship of the mobster hitman character, weird editing, atrocious acting by newbie cast members, in particular the open at all hours nurse, Leyla. Disjointed ""plots"", lame stories, go nowhere and dropped plotlines, and stupid music choices permeated each show. I believe it's only claim to fame is that it was mocked on ""The Soup"" on E!

If you're in the market for annoying clowns, insulting boob jokes, ridiculous rooftop dancing with the hospital staff re-enacting the cafeteria scene from ""Fame"", the constant humiliation and belittling of a beloved, long time heroine, the wasted talents of Mr. Billy Dee Williams, as well as an ample serving of a forced, contrived, and vomit inducing ""pairing"" of the ""hot"" (not deserved for this character on NS) neurosurgeon and his predatory stalker student nurse, as well as racial stereotypes and mocking of serious social issues such as abortion, sex addictions, and HIV, then HEY!! this show IS for you!

The only bright spot in the entire series was the performance of Kimberly McCullough as Dr. Robin Scorpio. This two-time Emmy winner managed to rise above the shoddy material she was given to work with, and still make you feel for her character's plight, as she continued to get dumped on more and more with each episode. I love Jason Thompson as Dr. Patrick Drake on GH, but his character was totally destroyed and unrecognizable on Night Shift. He's a fantastic actor, but NO ONE could have risen above how his character was being written, with no character motivation and point of view. Add to that a chemistry-free, awkward, and unwanted new ""romance"" (gag), and the writing was on the wall for his character.

Night Shift was marketed as a vehicle featuring the popular pairing of Robin and Patrick on GH. See them there, on the cover? Aren't they pretty? The producers, head writer and president of the network admitted that they basically had given this couple no airtime or story, despite overwhelming fan response. Fans were baited with promises of romance, hospital drama, sex scenes, and Robin and Patrick front and center. Well, except for a blink-and-you-miss-it 20 second shower scene, none of those things happened. There was some of the most passionless ""sex"" scenes I've ever seen between Patrick and another character, while Robin was left crying, alone and devastated, on the rooftop. There was an intense medical drama with an HIV+ expectant mother, in which the doctors were of no consequence whatsoever, since the hallowed hitman and his hacker sidekick were there to save the day. There was a dramatic shoot out in the ER, with...guess who? The hitman ""hero"" to the rescue yet again.

Somehow Night Shift managed to be even more offensive and less about the hospital than General Hospital is on a daily basis. That is certainly not a glowing review.

Basically, Night Shift was a nightmare. It certainly gave me many of them. Along with headaches, night tremors, and insomnia (Can't sleep. Might flash to gag worthy gurney sex scenes)<Shudders> I need medication just to forget this disaster ever happened.

Sorry Kimberly and Jason, no amount of cute behind the scenes special features are worth this torture. I know it wasn't your fault, but NS is the... WORST. SHOW. EVER. :(",1197244800,7,3597,4.927392739273928
3267808,1,B000YM6DNW,"I went in so excited for this show, that was supposed to revolve around my favorite daytime couple, Patrick Drake  and Robin Scropio, but was instantly dissappointed. It depicted them as totally different character and the story change half way through was a disasterious idea. The forced pairing of ""nurse"" Leyla and Patrick was nausiating and lacking in any chemistry. It was so horrible i stopped watching after acouple episodes.",1197158400,21,432,5.171428571428572
3267809,1,B000YM6DNW,"This was a waste of time. I went into it believing it would be about something and was left disappointed. Bob Guza (head writer) and Brian Frons (pres of ABC) basically pulled a bait and switch on fans. They said it would be about the popular couple Patrick and Robin and that this show wouldn't carry over to the original soap, General Hospital. On NS, it didn't seem like Patrick and Robin (Scrubs) even liked each other. And a lot of the stories did carry over, so that in fact it wasn't an alternative universe that was promised.

Whether you were a previous GH watcher or a new watcher all together, this series will leave you confused with its inconsistencies, bad editing, and lame writing. To be fair there were some highlights, but they didn't outweigh the bad.

The Bad:
- The non-chemistry filled ""relationship"" between Patrick and nurse Leyla, played by an actress with the screen presence and acting ability of a paper bag.
- The lack of screen time of the vixen you can't help but love, Maxie Jones (played brilliantly by Kristin Storms)
- The writing and editing.
- The lack of relationship development between Patrick and Robin.
- The confusing ending. Not worth it.
- The character destruction of Patrick Drake.

The Highlights:
- Actresses like Minae Noji and Kent King who were given the chance to show what they were capable of.
- New finds like the charismatic and talented Dominic Rains.
- When they highlighted Billy Dee Williams in more than just mopping the floor.
- The acting from Kimberly McCullough. There is a reason this woman is a two time Emmy award winner. Despite the crappy writing and the obsessive baby desires of her character, you just felt for her and cried along with her when the world was crumbling before her.
- Other note worthy performances where Bradford Anderson and Steve Burton.

What promised to be a riveting series, turned out to be a complete let down. If you want to see a love story, because we are all suckers for a good love story, this is definitely not the show. You want good writing and decent storytelling. Also not the show. I would only buy this DVD if by some miracle it was a different series all together. Since it's not, save yourself the disappointment and money. Mr. Bob Guza thanks for nothing. You do not know the fans at all.",1196985600,34,2300,4.602439024390244
