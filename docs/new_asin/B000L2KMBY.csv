8160013,4,B000L2KMBY,"I have been a ""FIRM"" fan for a long time and started with the Original Volume 1 with Susan Harris. These are a little ""dated"" as are the classic original volumes 1-6, but I like these workouts for a change. They may not be as challenging as the classics, but they still give me a good workout. I would recommend them to anyone who likes Anna Benson workouts. Some of the negatives; the cueing is the not best in some areas, some of the camera angles are shot on an angle (ie: not straight forward so it's harder to tell if your on the right let or left), and I would prefer a more challenging cardio workout, but it still gets my heart rate up, and it's easy to just make some of the moves a higher impact. Overall, I do like all the set.",1307145600,,738,4.096551724137931
8160014,5,B000L2KMBY,"I love, love, love these DVDs. I have a whole library of Firm, Tracie Long, and other exercise DVDs/ tapes but these are soooo good. I loved them so much that I bought the next 6 DVD pack ( Metaboost, Lean, Pump, etc...) They're slower but still challenging. Lots of great yoga/ pilates too. They are not newly made so I thank my lucky stars I found them! Anna Benson is the best choreographer! Delivery was fast.",1296000000,,413,4.376623376623376
8160015,5,B000L2KMBY,"I love these DVDs.  The exercises are a little different from your usual ""aerobics"" and keep you interested.  Esp. having the whole set, I can follow their guidelines for a whole month of workouts.  No more getting bored from the same DVD in row.  This set works for me because there are no complicated combinations to follow but I get a really good workout.  It has a blend of pilates, some yoga, strength training and I love the props! - A step stool, a tall stick as well as weights and yoga block.",1273449600,,501,4.344086021505376
