6604748,5,B00MYMTCS8,"I love the music.  I have seen Itzhak Perlman perform Klezmer live in New York City.  This DVD comes as close to a live performance that I have ever watched.  The interaction between Perlman is Helfgot is amazing.  Some of the cuts brought tears to my eyes.  The production values are amazing.  The sound is clean and clear.  The visual elements are striking.  There is amazing color saturation.  The video director displays a keen sense of place and movement.  As far as I am concerned this DVD should become the textbook example of how to ""do it right.""",1432944000,3,555,4.571428571428571

8675345,5,B00MYMTCS8,"This DVD consists primarily of a performance by Itzhak Perlman, the Klezmer Conservatory Band, and Cantor Yitzchak Meir Helfgot (hes *amazing*), interspersed with interviews featuring the delightful Joel Grey, Neil Sedaka, and Elie Wiesel.  This performance is a combination of Yiddish folk and theater tunes, Hassidic melodies, and virtuoso klezmer melodies  all of which are right up this listeners alley.

There are not enough superlatives to describe the emotional aspects of Mr. Perlman and Mr. Helfgots performances, but suffice it to say that they are having an insane amount of fun making this music, and the joy is infectious.  It is also clear that the members of the Klezhmer Conservatory Band are enjoying themselves immensely (pay particular attention to the Clarinet  it sings!), and they bring not only a sense of history but of sheer human feelings to the music being presented.  This is particularly evident in YismKhu as well as Adir Hu/Moyshe Emes.

The segments with Joel Grey and Neil Sedaka are most enjoyable, not only because it is a treat to see them, but because they are obviously joined together at a very fundamental level by the music and emotions evoked by what is being performed and brought to life.  Cantor Helfgot and Mr. Perlman are an amazing pair to behold, each feeding off of the energy of the other.  This is a fine example of people at the top of their game excelling at the highest level, each inspiring and pushing the other to achieve the most that they possibly can  its astonishing and wonderful, and it makes this listener envious of the experience that each audience member had that was physically present.
The liner notes, while brief, are informative and do provide the English translation of the Yiddish vocals.  This is music for the heart, spirit, and intellect, and it is a delight to experience when presented by these insanely talented musicians.  Very highly recommended!",1444176000,,1929,5.012539184952978
