8084999,1,B000BBOUFO,"The workout lasts about 18 minutes in which you will be doing the same sit-up exercise once and again.  Then, they tell you that if you want to do an ""advanced"" version, you have to use a little thingy, that kind of rotates back and forth; to me, it just seemed that they wanted you to buy something.  The music, well, you are doing sit-ups, so they did not think that you really needed that much music, so the track is just like any other, nothing special, nothin' hip-hoppity (so to speak).

I believe it includes about five minutes of arms workout.  That's it.  I have nothing more to say about that.

The thing is that if you are looking for a really light workout that doesn't hurt or make you sweat, it is good.  If you want a workout to do before you go to the office, and not having to take a shower afterwards, it is good.  If you are injured, it is good.  Otherwise, keep looking for another dvd that's a little more challenging (the selection would be huge). Oh, and Carlos Llanos makes no difference, he might be good, but the workout is bad.  Plus, choosing family instead of professionals as your ""crew"" does not help.",1260144000,3,1132,4.347619047619047
8085000,1,B000BBOUFO,As a person with a catalog of over 100 exercise DVD's and videos I was so unimpressed with this particular selection. It would perhaps be helpful if you have never ever done any abdominal and arm exercises or if you had been severly injured and are trying to recuperate doing minimal exercise per doctor's orders.  There are very few actual exercises on this DVD.,1167868800,8,363,4.671875
