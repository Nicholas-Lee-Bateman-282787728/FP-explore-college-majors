4124858,5,B003HC9JDC,"Doing Pilates and Yoga with your videos (Better Posture, Pilates on the Go, Morning and Bedtime Stretches) has been very beneficial to me, mentally and physically. I have noticed such a change from the very beginning.!  I now try to remember the specific movements you describe to correct my posture throughout the day.  The numbness and discomfort I get in my right side rarely happens anymore, and when it does I can perform some of the stretches to alleviate it. I am so grateful to have found these wonderful DVDs!",1290729600,4,518,4.7444444444444445
4124859,4,B003HC9JDC,"You have an awesome selection of DVDs!  I watched your excellent teaching on the You Tube samples and have decided to invest in 3 of your DVDs to start:  Toned Arms, Buttocks and Thighs, Beginner Pilates in Detail and The Foam Roller.  As a man, I've  always felt self-conscious about going to Pilates and Yoga classes, because there are always more women than men in  class, but also wanted the benefits I've heard you can get from these exercises.  I've finally  decided to give it a try in my house and what a great decision that was!  The way you teach, is like I have personal instruction in my own living room anyway and I can put a DVD on whenever I can find a half-hour.  My push-ups are better then ever and, my arms, back and chest are getting so much stronger although not bulky at all.  In a very short time, my flexibility has improved, both in the back and legs. At this rate, I will be able to touch my toes soon.  My Abs are getting so much stronger!  I've been running for many years and have had knee pain because of tightness in my outer thighs. What a difference the Foam Roller massage is making!  I'm hooked.  Sometimes I roll my back and thighs on it 2-3 times a day because it takes only a few minutes and it makes me feel so much better.  I'm grateful for the knowledge that you shared in your videos!  (Ray, Nov 22, 2010)",1290470400,7,1347,4.244094488188976
4124860,5,B003HC9JDC,"I just wanted to let you know that you have inspired me to do Pilates again, after a long pause.  I'm glad that I picked up your DVDs!  There are so professionally done, the exercises are so well explained, the movements make much more sense now - plus I'm seeing results that I had been seeking, after only working with them DVDs for a short time.  What a worthwhile investment!  Love all 3 of them: Pilates on the Go, Principles and Basics of Pilates, Beginner Pilates - in Detail plus 2 Progressive Workout Sequences.  Your Foam Roller, too, it's such a good workout !!  and much cheaper than going for a massage!",1290297600,2,616,4.455357142857143
4124861,2,B003HC9JDC,"With this I only got the DVD. It looks like you get the foam roller also. I am very disappointed my whole reason for ordering this was for the foam roller. I am sure the DVD would be great if I had the foam roller to use with it.
  Maybe you should remove the comma after foam roller. You even talk about the foam roller in your description of the product.",1288915200,10,356,4.0
4124862,5,B003HC9JDC,"I don't often have to get out my foam roller, but when I do I praise whoever the heck invented it.

I learned about the foam roller as a massage tool from a personal trainer who was showing me very basic moves on it after having done a marathon and she was all but purring while explaining how it helps ease muscle pain.

After pushing myself one week very hard in the gym, I knew I either had to hire a masseuse or get a foam roller. The foam roller you pay for once and get to continue using again and again so I opted for that.  (you can get one at any sports store.  I'm sure on Amazon probably as well. It is essentially a thicker smaller version of the foam ""noodles"" one uses in the pool)

Mine came with a DVD showing how the roller is used by professional football and sports team to ease muscle pain by deeply massaging your muscles utilizing your own body weight to roll the foam roller. However, it was geared towards men, it was very basic, and some explanations weren't clear. So I was always doing just a few basic moves with it.

I received a set of workout DVDs from a friend and this is one of my favorites because my foam roller just found new uses..not only in healing muscle pain but, now in gaining strength as well.

The video length is 30 minutes so it's far more thorough than my previous instruction DVD and many of the moves you'll remember and eventually simply be able to do well on your own.  The instructor is warm and engaging and not only shows you how to utilize the foam roller to give you a heavenly back and leg massage, but also how to use it to strengthen your core and arms.  There are wonderful thigh and hip stretches as well.

If you EVER workout to the point that you are sore, this is a wonderful DVD to have on your shelf.  I'm working on a stone retaining wall in my backyard that I thought would be a good idea to build myself.  With LARGE limestones.  I can honestly say, had I not had this DVD last week I would probably have needed some serious pain medication I was in so sore.  I hadn't realized how much weight I was lifting until the next day when I knew I'd overdone it.  This allows you to correctly use a foam roller for a DEEP tissue massage. And being able to do it in my living room while watching tv rather than scheduling a massage appointment...heaven!

Know going in: This DVD is not a Hollywood studio type...there isn't music etc...it's good instruction and results-oriented, however and I was happy to have it. No music and special effects needed.",1286755200,86,2515,4.274261603375527
4124883,3,B003HC9JDC,"It is somewhat harder than what I expected.  It does work great when my back needs stretched, but is a bit too firm.",1420070400,,116,4.043478260869565

4124886,2,B003HC9JDC,"I worked out with my foam roller with a Karen Voight DVD two days in a row on 4-12 and 4-13 (having only worked out once before on the foam roller with a DeSilva DVD).  The pain in my ribs on the left side was excruciating by Wednesday night.  I assume it was the sit ups on this roller device that brought on the pain.  I probably averaged 3 to 4 hours of sleep on 4-16,4-17 and 4-18.  It hurt to breathe deeply, cough, etc.  I was still in such discomfort today and so darn tired, I seriously checked out Urgent Care centers to see if I could get an x-ray, thinking maybe I cracked a rib and needed muscle relaxants.  Unfortunately, none of the local urgent cares took my insurance except for one that didn't have an x-ray machine available on weekends.  I could not even do a stretch tape today, and I am NOT a hypochondriac.  It's been the first time I've never done at least some kind of exercise tape on the weekend in years.

I am not giving 2 stars for the DVD workout itself, as I have not yet tried that one.  But the two other foam roller DVDs by well known instructors who I've never had any complaints about before have convinced me that it is the foam roller itself to beware of.  If I was rating only the foam roller, I'd give it a negative number.  I can do modified situps for 10 minutes straight minimum.  Maybe I was not exactly aligned when doing situps on the roller.  All I know is that after trying numerous exercise equipment (the old ""step,"" a mini trampoline, the ""bean,"" big exercise balls, the ""wave,"" etc.), the foam roller was the most difficult and painful.  Maybe it's just not meant for 50+ year olds  This is the worst exercise gimic I've ever had the nonfortune to waste money on.",1397865600,,1715,4.279503105590062

4124888,5,B003HC9JDC,this is a great roller for your workout. I like to use the roller for those tense shoulder muscles from stress.  It is also great for back tension.  I love dealing with Amazon.,1394064000,,176,4.303030303030303
4124889,2,B003HC9JDC,I got a foam roller  from a sporting goods store and loved how it helped loosen tight muscles.  It came with a 15 minute instructional DVD that was very helpful in getting full use out of the roller.  I was looking for a longer workout  for it and this DVD seemed to get a lot of good reviews. The workout and presentation on this DVD was so uninspiring however that I can't imagine ever using it again.,1386979200,,403,4.194805194805195

4124891,3,B003HC9JDC,"I was looking for more Massage and less Workout.

If you are looking for more Workout and SOME Massage than this would be a 4 or 5 Star DVD.  The Workout is Intense and NOT for beginners.  Of course you get massage with the workout but the emphasis is on the workout.

4124913,5,B003HC9JDC,"I really enjoy using this DVD because I train a lot & get kinks & sore spots in my body.  This is as good as a deep tissue massage, for me.  Massages are good but quite costly; this I can do this a few times a week & I get good results, from the comfort of my own mat.  So if you train hard & wish for a massage but find it's not in your budget, get this DVD & give yourself a massage.",1371427200,,385,3.5595238095238093

4124919,2,B003HC9JDC,"The instructor is competent, but she talks so slowly - it makes the video boring.  It was difficult to stay motivated.  Also, when she does moves on the roller, the camera should zoom in on her legs and the movements so it would be clearer.  Hoping to find a better video than this.",1325462400,3,282,4.283018867924528
4124920,5,B003HC9JDC,"A few months of playing with my foam roller guided by Michaela's ""Foam Roller Workout & Massage"" (the perfect, basic, ""how to"" DVD to start with), I've decided that I'm ready for more.  The Foam Roller Intermediate & Advanced levels, 2 videos on Disc 2 of 2 - have proven to be more excellent choices.  Michaela's thorough explanation of the various movements and her compassionate teaching style (in her lovely, soothing tone of voice), hold great appeal to me.  I feel that although I'm working with a video I'm not going to hurt myself because she reminds me ""do"" and ""don'ts"". I also feel much progress in terms of ease of movement and greater strength.  I'm glad to have bought both INT & ADV levels because I can vary my mat workouts more. There are actually some ADV moves I can and some INT moves that I can't do - yet! - though I'm confident that I will get there. Thank you, Michaela, for your great foam roller DVDs!",1325376000,2,927,4.4674556213017755
4124921,5,B003HC9JDC,"I really like these 3 Foam Roller videos and they are worth every penny!
Having heard of the many benefits of using a Foam Roller, I bought one, and Michaela's 3 instruction videos: The Foam Roller Workout & Massage, which is a Beginner level (note it is the same as Disc 1 of 2 here at Amazon), plus the Intermediate and Advanced - Disc 2 of 2.  The Beginner workout is basic and thorough instruction, the moves and positioning explained in detail so that everyone can get acquainted with the roller, regardless of their fitness level.  Great cues provided throughout on how to engage your muscles properly and to position so that you get stronger without hurting yourself in the process.  I wanted to know just how far you can go with a Foam Roller, reason I bought the INT and ADV, so I found out!  I'm thrilled to know that I will likely never run out of moves or ever get bored of training on my mat at home. For now, I look forward to getting stronger and more fit every day with the basics so that I can try the challenging Intermediate & Advanced soon.",1322956800,9,1060,4.365482233502538
4124922,2,B003HC9JDC,"I liked this DVD.  There are Pros to it, however there are also a few things that detract.  The pros:  the instructor is pleasant and the exercises are basic, but thorough.  The cons: this workout is not suitable for anyone with a wrist injury or weakness.  Only one of the stretches (the thigh stretch) can be easily modified and the instructor actually doesn't demonstrate any modifications.  If you have arthritis, tendinitis or really any wrist or shoulder issues be aware that this is likely not the workout for you.  You will need to be able to bear roughly half of your body weight on your wrists/shoulders for about 2/3rds of this workout.

Again, if you have no injury concerns, it is a pleasant, basic and relaxing workout.  It really is designed for people who are already in shape, have some familiarity with Pilates and have no permanent or recurrent shoulder or wrist injuries.",1319846400,22,891,4.771241830065359
4124933,1,B003HC9JDC,"I'm really disappointed with this DVD.  1) It doesn't play on the DVD player in my workout area.  My other DVD's all work here, but not this one.  I do have a DVD in my living room and it does work there so I can't return this.  But, that player is about the same age so I'm not sure why it works on one and not the other.  I have no room to workout in my living room - so it's of no use to me.  2)  I wish I had known ahead of time that the instructor has a pretty strong accent.  3) It's way too much talking and not enough workout.

She explains how to safely progress from one exercise to a more complex one and how to position properly so you get the most out of your exercise.  I highly recommend this instructor and her videos!

At the recommendation of a friend, I've invested in 3 of Michaela's videos: ""The Foam Roller"", ""Better Posture"" and ""Toned Arms, Buttocks and Thighs"".  I am absolutely thrilled with my results so far and just love the instructor!  I've taken many exercise classes over the years and can honestly say that I've never had a better  instructor. Michaela gives detailed, precise cues on body positioning and working safely towards more advanced moves. She reminds you of key muscles that should be engaged and the ones should relax.

I paused for a quick lunch break, stressed and harried, and went back to work feeling relaxed and 3 inches taller from all of the wonderful stretches on your Foam Roller DVD.  I connected so well with the way you teach, too.  I love how you explain the exercises, with compassion and a sense of humour, and how you guide us from the simple to more complex moves.  The combination of Pilates and Yoga moves translated to the foam roller is just PERFECT.  Sure helped me clear the mind and left my body feeling great!!",1302220800,2,565,4.446601941747573

When I became pregnant with our third child, I developed pretty bad sciatica pain.  My desperate search for natural relief ended in taking a friend's advice: ""go back to Pilates""!  That's how I decided to invest in Michaela's 'Beginner Pilates in Detail' and 'The Foam Roller' DVDs.  I'm so glad I did!  The Pilates exercises helped get a better workout on the foam roller because my core muscles got stronger and stronger as I practiced.  The Foam Roller is such a fantastic, deep massage.  You feel like no muscles were left untouched when you are done.  I like Michaela's style very much, as she presents the exercises very well and makes them easy to understand.  She is serious in her instruction, but at the same time witty and engaging with her little jokes, smiles and giggles.  I love that because it puts me at ease, which helps me work out even harder.",1297296000,5,997,4.613636363636363
4124940,5,B003HC9JDC,"I have retired early, so I'm on the golf course a few days a week. Like most passionate golfers, my goal over the years has been to improve my swing and the enjoyment of the game.  I've been hearing that many competitive golfers, men and women, practice Pilates to learn how to use their core muscles more efficiently, but I never tried it myself until I started working with your DVDs.  What a great Christmas gift my wife bought up for me!  (your ""Principles and Basics of Pilates"", ""Beginner Pilates in Detail"" and ""About Balance"" DVDs).  I can't believe how much of a difference these exercises are making!  After only a month of practice my abdominal muscles feel stronger, I can twist better, I am aware of tensing my neck and shoulders, I breathe more often and have more energy - my whole body feels great!

What I most like about your DVDs is that you explain things so very simply.  More than that, you give the reason for each move.  Maybe not everybody needs to know why, or what, is being worked in a given exercise, but I do.  Your demeanour is pleasant and assuring; you smile and giggle from time to time, which makes the viewer feel you're human and likeable; you give us an ""out"" (i.e. do what we can, don't strain, build toward maximum achievement, etc.); your accent is exotic, which somehow gives the viewer confidence in your ability; and you ""speak"" to your audience through eye contact.

Repetition is so important when learning the basics of any endeavour.  I am glad to see that you employ this method, as the volume of information can be overwhelming to the beginner.  In fact, you stated that at the outset.

I really like how you demonstrate the manoeuvre at the start of each segment, then break it down and explain each element.  That is perfect.  The intelligent, serious student ""gets"" that.

By the way, my wife also picked up your Foam Roller video - she loves it!  She got me to roll my back and thighs on it a few times too, and although it was painful to start, I can see how my legs and back feel looser already.  Thanks a lot for your great videos!

I really like how she even explains the ""why's"" of each maneouvre and how she specifically targets muscle groups I haven't used in a while.  After the workout, I feel refreshed, like I have a different body!  Then I take the lessons and apply them during my day.

I thought one must have a degree of flexibility and core strength to engage in these classes.  One day I stumbled upon some pieces of your videos on Youtube.  I followed your instructions and was impressed by how clear and concise your cues are, and how much the few exercises you selected helped me!  The Foam Roller thigh stretches feel like ""ouch"" but they sure work.  So do the stretches you teach in your Better Posture DVD.  These are slowly changing the way I sit and move, as I remember to practice them many times a day.
