8459448,1,B0056EBHD4,Literally all the seasons (for more money!!) cellophaned together. Not a box set by any means.,1521331200,,94,4.9375
8459449,5,B0056EBHD4,me and my guy can't get enough watching this. I would totally recommend to anyone. :) I have had no problems w/the dvd's yet.,1391904000,3,125,4.25
8459450,1,B0056EBHD4,"if any of you are dumb enough to buy this you deserve to have your wallet put in a lock box to keep it safe from your stupidity
and for the sellers selling this shame on you for ripping off poor dumb people

you can easily pick up seasons 1-4 use for under $5 each and seasons 5-7 are about $10

if you want them new they are about $15 each",1367107200,18,340,3.7746478873239435
8459451,1,B0056EBHD4,"The show is great, and the sets are good packages. But I bought all 7 sets plus the movie for $85, or about $65 cheaper than this deal. Buy them separately.",1347148800,10,156,4.064516129032258
8459452,1,B0056EBHD4,"As of this writing, buying the individual seasons
and movie will cost you about fifty bucks less than
this 'collection'.

Hate when they create these kind of bundles that actually cost more
than the items within!",1344729600,27,212,4.888888888888889
8459453,1,B0056EBHD4,"As of this date you can buy all the individual seasons for almost
fifty dollars less than this 'collection' (which is just all the separate
season boxes).

Always bugs me when they package a group of items and charge MORE
than it would cost to simply buy them separately",1344729600,13,270,4.510204081632653
