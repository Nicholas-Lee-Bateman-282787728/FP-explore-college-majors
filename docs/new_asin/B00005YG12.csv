7956922,3,B00005YG12,"My grand children LOVE BibleMan with Robert t. Shlipp as BibleMan. With Willie Aames, they aren't convinced that Willie's BibleMan is ""Holy"". ""He's too into himself and the world"" These are the words of a 3 year old. They Love Robert T. Shlipp. ""He's real Papo!"" It is a decent story line and The Prince of Pride steals the show, but the message gets lost in Aames lack of annointing. He seems like any actor who is paid to act.

At this time, we only want the series that have Robert T Shlipp as BibleMan",1360972800,,505,4.315789473684211
