8671434,1,B00MBI0AH2,"Emily (Kate Marie Davies) pays for a thumb drive that contains 3 hand-held shorts of paranormal activity. The first one is shot in the outback as two guys are out in some brush and hear growling. It contains the blurry running cam and a lot of WTF to add realism. The second one is a mother and son team go ghost hunter in a Rochester, NY cemetery. It has the dreaded green cam. The third and longest feature is shot in black and white. A man moves from Manchester to Chester into a house with a haunted attic. Apparently a witch lived there. After watching the first two Emily reflects on what the audience feels, ""Wasting my Time."" Emily lives in Chester.

The films were all shot poorly even for fans of the genre. The stories were intensely boring. The opening credits gave me a headache.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Plug for ""Sloppy the Psychotic.""",1481241600,,859,4.464968152866242
