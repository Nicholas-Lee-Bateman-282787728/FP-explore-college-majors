2952800,5,B000VT6ZUO,Great DVD.Great movie. Must have. A+,1435708800,,36,5.166666666666667
2952801,2,B000VT6ZUO,"I wouldn't give this 3 stars...more like 2.5. It's full of decent twists down the stretch, and the first 30 minutes are good, but the 30 minutes in the middle is filled with stupidity. It's hard to believe the dumb decisions made by the lead character. This is a watchable made for tv type of movie. However, it's nothing I'd wanna watch again....or seriously recommend to anyone.",1431561600,2,380,4.686567164179104
2952802,5,B000VT6ZUO,Loved It.,1413331200,,9,4.0
2952803,4,B000VT6ZUO,"Bristling with sexual tension and corporate intrigue, Crimes of Passion is the story of what happens when two workers who are secret lovers team up in an attempt to score a huge sexual harassment settlement against their employer, a major corporation.  When the detective assigned tot he case discovers their scheme and tries to blackmail them, the two are caught in a twisted web of deceit and betrayal. (from the back cover)

This movie has decent acting and a pretty good plot.  You know almost immediately that the main character, who thinks he is running he show, is being double-crossed.  What you don't know is who or how many people are setting him up for the fall.  I must say the kind of surprise ending is very satisfying.",1224979200,12,733,4.6953125

8219866,4,B000VT6ZUO,This was a good movie you will not be disappointed. The only bad thing about the movie was the wife. I didn't think she added to the movie. If they would have selected another actor I think the movie could have been better. But that is just my opinion. But other than that this was a good action betrayal movie. I really enjoyed watching it.,1519257600,,341,4.2615384615384615
8219867,4,B000VT6ZUO,"I actually enjoyed this Film more than I thought I would. This is a Film that makes You want to curl-up with a few Snacks on a Relaxing Evening and try to figure out the next twist to the Storyline.
I viewed this through Amazon Prime, but I'm considering purchasing and adding it to My Chick Flick/Wine Party Faves Selection!
Some of the Reviews give a Thumbs Down for whatever reason, and I can be a harsh critic sometimes too, but this Film wasn't that Bad.
I usually don't comment on the Films I purchase or view- that would be a Full-Time Job if I did.
Adult themes, but no Gratuitous Nudity or Language.
Acting not Bad. I'd Recommend it for Viewing. The Title is a bit misleading. Should have bee Titled "" Greed and Deception"".",1517961600,,732,4.389705882352941

8219869,2,B000VT6ZUO,"Let's make some distinctions here. This is not a ""cinematic/ made for the movie theatre"" movie. At best, it is made for TV, to be watched once and aimed at a bored, tranqued out audience.  The characters are acted by B-roll actors. The script is inane.  The plot, not really believable. Oh and the most telling part that makes it SO unbelievable - the timeframe is 2015/current, yet all the incriminating photos are shot with film. NO ONE shoots film anymore.",1505865600,,459,4.654320987654321

8219873,5,B000VT6ZUO,"I love ""who done it"" movies.  This movie had lots of twists and turns.  I thought the actors were good and there was some good  filmography with fall foliage.  Someone's review said it was a Made-for-tv movie...maybe it was and big screen version would have more dramatic with a sex scene, foul language, and move violent. One person wrote that they figured out how the ending was going to happen way before the end....I didn't.  It was a surprise.  I loved it.",1502236800,,461,4.560975609756097

8219875,1,B000VT6ZUO,This was obviously made for tv with scene breaks for commercials.  That would be ok if the  story & acting was any good.,1498694400,,120,4.173913043478261
