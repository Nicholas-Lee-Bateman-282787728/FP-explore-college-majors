8079071,4,B0001EFTLK,"After their constant failures, the Commander (aided by his Funnel cannons) points out the serious flaw in his underling's actions- their inability to work as a team. Heeding their leader's words, the trio of Zapper, Grappler and Destroyer develop a team work attack to take out the Gundams.
Following that, a slip up with Bell Wood's newly completed dimensional transport device flings the Gundam Force to Zero's ruined homeland of Lacroa. There they face the power of Lord Tallgeese, a Dark Axis warrior beyond anything they've faced before...
The initial episode here follows the ho-hum feeling that ruled volume 3. In what seems to be a tribute to the Black Tri-Stars from the original series, the Dark Axis generals develop an attack which combines their powers. The Gundams attempts to combat this new attack coincides with Shute trying to write an essay on friendship. It's really a filler episode with a sappy moral. There are some good parts, such as the Zako's imitating the Gundams for target practice, but overall it's outweighed by the cheesiness (even the stock footage is extended to fill time).
The remaining two episodes are a noticable step up. Bell Wood has managed to fix the wrecked dimensional transporter. However, his wish to test it first doesn't sit well with Bakunetsumaru, leading to a fight between the samurai and Zero which ends in damaging the controls. Shute and the Gundams are whisked away to the ruined land of Lacroa, where Zero used to live. The land is ruled by Lord Tallgeese, an evil knight whom the Dark Axis have given control to. Relishing the chance for some fresh competition that the Gundams represent, Tallgeese soon ambushes them and reveals he is nothing like the bungling trio that the Gundams are used to dealing with. The Gundams are befriended brother triplets native to Lacroa, who are waiting for the 'saviour' to arrive to give him something important. Zero believes that they may be refering to him but his inability to challenge Tallgeese places heavy doubt in the boys minds. This 3-part storyline (to be finished on the next disc) is focused on developing Zero's own destiny and making him less ""that Knight Gundam who fights with Captain"".
As some might of guessed, Lacroa is based on the popular Gundam Wing series. The land is filled with Knight versions of mecha from that series (so far limited to Zero, Lord Tallgeese and Deathscythe) and even the Zako soldiers are replaced by Pawn Leos, based on Wing's most common grunts. It's the parody/homage elements like this that I really enjoy.
Probably the best disc in the series yet. It's a shame that the entire Lacroa trilogy couldn't be on it, but the two episodes included have plenty of good moments. The Zako Zako Hour is also much missed, but they story shines this time. Definetly reccomended.",1083888000,,2813,4.89937106918239
