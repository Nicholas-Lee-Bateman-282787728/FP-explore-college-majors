8531667,5,B008X8L8UC,Just watched this and WOW! I didn't expect it would be so funny and entertaining. It has a lot of adult humour and is not a child's movie. I'm sharing this movie with my friends.,1519084800,,178,4.114285714285714

8531669,5,B008X8L8UC,"The Young Mariners Society is a small nautical league of aspiring seafaring boys that I run from my boat here in Iowa. We spend countless nights on my boat just a few yards from the lake. Eventually, when the repairs are complete, we will take the boat out on the water. I know I worked those boys hard this summer, but it was the only way I knew how to prepare them for manhood. Much of their training was based off of the television show `Deadliest Catch' along with the movies `Cabin Boy 'and `Down Periscope.'
Upon graduation, several of my well-instructed little seamen have taken upon themselves the distinguished title of ""Mariner.""
Winning the rope swinging competition this past summer with my boys, I gave them a night off from our rigorous activities to enjoy a little R&R with a movie night.  Without a doubt, they earned it.  This movie was selected for its theme of maturation from boy to man.
To everyone's delight, this movie was a hit.
Family values galore in this movie and no home should be complete without it.",1383782400,,1030,4.592391304347826
8531670,4,B008X8L8UC,"Unlike other cinematic movies, this one has strong language. Literally in the first 10 minutes of the movie I've heard explicit content maybe like 30 times. Despite that, love get's replaced by talking about getting laid, and some other content that is not appropriate for children. The graphics and models were okay. At first I had this issue with bad language, sexual content, but in the end I enjoyed the movie. Do not expect too much from it. One other thing, I see it being sold for 40$. It's not worth it. I'd give it 15$ at best.",1365033600,7,536,4.479591836734694
