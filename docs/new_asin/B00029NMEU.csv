2072874,5,B00029NMEU,"Maria Mercedes was the finest Novella to begin a Superstar, when it came out in the early 1990s,but after Maria Mercedes a Novela came out that changed many things, and like Thalia huge names came out of Abrazame Muy Furete, who were known already, but became bigger and bigger later on. The Novela of Abrazame Muy Fuerte was a powerful Novela, as it was written by a mighty Screenwriter and playwright.
For Me this is a Novela that BROKE THE MOLD!!!!!!! Many other ones had influences from this one Novela, like earlier grand performances in Corazon Salvaje and Los Ricos Tambien Lloran, did in the 1990s and 1980s. As for the performances of the actors and actresses in the Novela, for me they are amaizing, and legendary.
This Novela was the tale of a woman who suffered as a child because of her father's strict attitudes, while later on she suffered at the hands of a husband who was cold and sadistic. The tale is of Christina as that is the woman's name, and she had a daughter but of a man who her family refused to accept, and after her marriage she lost her child, forever, although the child was given illigaly to a local Prostitute of her town, whose mother worked for Cristina's family, by Cristina's own father at only a few days old.
Because of such a a cruel injustice, the child grew up to only knowing Cristina as her Madrina or Godmother. Cristina lost her sight in a horrible accident, and life would be that of JOB for her, throughout most of the tale. The child was Maria del Carmen, and she would suffer just as much as her real mother. In the end they both find happiness and each other, as Mother and Daughter. The villain by the way was Federico Rivero and he was the finest portrayed villain in many years for any Mexican Telenovela.
The Novela was definatley based on JOB, and it was also filmed in the beautiful State of Veracruz as well as the city of Tlacopalpan, which is in one of the greatest river basins of the Gulf Coast of all the Gulf of Mexico. The Novela was set in Tabasco, which is just as beautiful as Veracruz, and they did film in Tabasco's capitol of Villahermosa; which is a little known but beautiful city, of old and new buildings, as well as it having a huge outside Museum that is dedicated to the Archeological site at La Venta; that is on Tabasco's coast near Veracruz.
This Novela made huge success as a Novela, and it made Araceli Arambula {Maria del Carmen}, and Cesar Evora {Federico Rivero}, as well as Pablo Montero, who played a supporting role of wondrous form, who married Maria del Carmen; as huge stars. The mighty and beautiful Victoria Ruffo, and the beautiful and heroine of Carmen Salinas were actresses who made themselves huge long before; but they became massive stars more and more, when as for Victoria Ruffo she played Cristina, and Carmen Salinas played the elder lady of the town who became Presidente Municipal {Mexico's title of Mayor,} but was thrown in Jail for an accidental Murder.
Two comic relief parts were written in the Play, and they were two has been Princesses of wealth, when as for the son of the role of Carmen Salinas, he slept with one of these sisters {who were way older than him}. There was also in this Novela a classic role that was played in a double image by Helena Rojo, and it even won her a huge award.
Abrazame Muy Fuerte was Best Novella for 2000 A.D. by Tele Y Novellas Magazine and its Patrons, in which this is definitely the finest and most important performance of a Novela for Mexico or all Latin America, since Corazon Salvaje, which was the Novella of which began the legends of Edith Gonzales and the late Eduardo Palomo.
I hope that I do not anger people by putting my telling as carefull as possible a little brief of the tale for that is the content of the Novela. The Music is wonderous, and a Soundtrack came out with Pop and Mariachi songs that were on the Novela. Pablo Montero and Araceli Arambula sang beautiful songs for the Soundtrack, while the theme song was sung and written by the mighty and immortal Juan Gabriel.",1124841600,10,4046,4.513623978201635
2072875,4,B00029NMEU,"Although it isn't the complete the novela, what is on the DVD is incredible and suspenseful.  Todos los partes importantes para la historia de Cristina y Federico fueron incluido - todos los momentos de sospenso y sorpresa entre Mariadel Carmen, Carlos Manuel y Jose Maria - me encanta todo.

Whether you're a fan of any member of the cast or not, adding this DVD to your collection is well worth it.",1122854400,,400,4.619718309859155
2072876,1,B00029NMEU,"I guess I should have known better!!!

This is one of my favorite soap operas and yet this dvd was horrible!!!

Don't waste your money!

I realize they were trying to save time and money by editing pretty much EVERYTHING, but it was ridiculous!

The theme song was changed and the soap opera itself was butchered!

When I first heard of this soap coming out on dvd, I hoped that it would be just like every other series you buy. UNCUT with EXTRAS!

However, it was an incredible disappointment and you are better off waiting until the soap repeats late at night on Grandes Historias and recording it then!

I will never waste money on something like this again.",1107302400,44,661,4.504201680672269

2072879,5,B00029NMEU,I watched this novela when it aired years ago. I love Victoria Ruffo and Cesar Evora and buying this was a no brainer. Great quality. It is an abridged version of the novela. But still hits most of the important scenes.,1383091200,2,219,4.365853658536586

2072886,2,B00029NMEU,"En lo que a mi respecta me parece pesima la Edicion de este Dvd. Esta muy mal Editado, ya que perdio totalmente la esencia de la Telenovela, practicamente toda. Le faltan cientas de escenas importantes de la historia, fue horrible lo que hicieron en esta edicion. Sinceramente me desepciono totalmente. Para empezar el Dvd no contiene la cancion original de la Novela, el tema de Juan Gabriel, si bien tiene otro que esta bueno, pero no es lo mismo. Faltan muchisimas escenas de Fernando Colunga y Aracely Arambula. Si bien tiene lo mejor de Cesar Evora como Villano, le quitan muchisimas partes a Neyla Norvind, que fue bueno su papel en esa novela. No muestran cuando Federico la tira al rio, despues de haberla matado. Como tampoco aparece Helena Rojo en ninguna de las escenas en el papel de Damiana y Juliana, dos hermanas gemelas, que fue Exelente actriz. Por otra parte, algo que me parece de muy mal gusto, es que sacaron algo que le daba mucha emocion a la novela y son las escenas donde los actores se abrazaban y decian: abrazame, abrazame muy fuerte, que no en vano por algo tenia ese titulo no?... Otra cosa a destacar es la pesima edicion que hicieron sobre el final, que no se entiende porque Federico regresa con el pelo largo, de barba y en la ruina, ya que que sacan todas las escenas donde el huye cuando lo busca la policia y se fuga con el dinero que Raquela tenia ahorrado para irse junto con el, pero el decide irse solo, despues de robarle. Otra cosa es que la policia llega como de la nada, siendo que en la version televisiba llegaba porque Celia Ramos/Carmen Salinas llama a Cristina para prevenirla de que le parece que Federico andaba rondando por el pueblo, que le parecio verlo en la calle y es asi que se advierte a la policia que esten al pendiente por lo que pueda hacer. Despues sacan cuando Raquela va a la carcel por matar a Federico, y ella se arrepiente y le pide perdon a la Madre y a Benito por no poder amarlo y le dice a su madre que le diga a Maria del Carmen que la perdone y que le desea de corazon que sea feliz con Carlos Manuel. Otras de las escenas importantes de la historia que no estan son las que Cristina intenta suicidarse y Maria del Carmen la salva en la cascada y cuando ambas se reconcilian dias despues de que Maria del Carmen sale del Hospital. Tampoco estan las escenas de cuando culpan a Carlos Manuel de la muerte de Debora Falcon y finalmente se descubre que fue Federico Rivero quien la mato, porque cuando Debora murio al forsejear con Federico le arranco una cadena con un amuleto que le quedo en su mano agarrado y asi lo dejan libre a Carlos Manuel, y proceden a buscar a Federico para detenerlo y llevarlo preso. Por eso me parece pesima la Edicion del Dvd de esta Telenovela ya que no cuenta con nada de lo aqui mencionado, y porque pierde totalmente la esencia de la historia, incluso en la portada del Dvd dice que la duracion es de mas de 300 minutos, y eso ES MENTIRA, porque atras dice: Duracion 267 Minutos Aproximadamente, y Dura 267 Minutos en realidad, podrian haber dejado mas Escenas y haber hecho una Version Mejor del Dvd. Pesimo!!!",1287705600,,3118,4.443280977312391

2072888,3,B00029NMEU,It was ok not all that.  A lot of part missing.  Was edited in a interesting kind of way.  Not as expected.,1245369600,,107,3.772727272727273
2072889,2,B00029NMEU,"I recently ( after ""Pasin"" ) became a Fernando Colunga fan and decided to see his earlier works. I heard so much of this TN so I thought it was a good starting point. It was not! Yes, actors were great. But this version was edited so much so sometimes you can't even follow the plot.
Some characters that one minute where bleeding  and hardly survived - in a next scene were healthy and wealthy like nothing happened. And vise versa - with no reason somebody appears with broken arm or so.
  Yes, all(?) evil deeds were shown  but there was almost nothing left from romantic scenes. Nada.
It's not supposed to be a mystery novel, it is a telenovela - by definition it should be a melodrama. And watching this DVD I can say - it wasn't!",1210291200,,735,4.304347826086956
2072890,4,B00029NMEU,"This abridged version was fairly good, but only if you've seen the uncut Televisa version. Many of the scenes seemed to hold together on their own, so if you haven't seen the television version, it still holds a fair bit of excitement in this fast-paced drama. Both Victoria Ruffo and Cesar Evora were excellent in their roles. Definitely worth viewing.",1184544000,,353,4.9
2072891,3,B00029NMEU,The product was in excellent condition. The bad thing about this DVD is that the soap opera is abridged.,1168300800,,104,4.526315789473684

I gave it a 1 star.",1162512000,2,453,3.6391752577319587
2072894,3,B00029NMEU,"While this DVD has enough of the story to provide a good picture of the performances of Victoria Ruffo, Cesar Evora, and Pablo Montero, it misses too much of Nalia Norvind's villainous Deborah (crediting Federico with a murder she commits) and leaves far too much of Carmen Salinas' -- and even Fernando Colunga's -- character on the cutting room floor.  The entire subplot of the story is missing (which I expected and which is actually a good thing) but several key scenes are missing that aid understanding of the story and provide some important nuances to the other characters.  Viewers of the original series will be disappointed at the deletion of its most emotionally manipulative scene (when Maria del Carmen prevents Cristina from committing suicide), the possession of Raquela, and the horrible murder of Chiquilin, which adds to the towering evil of Federico.

I suspect that Televisa had neglected to negotiate the DVD rights to the megahit original theme song; the lack of the original music is also a problem.  Also missing was Pablo Montero's magnificent rendition of ""Cruz de Olvido"" that was played over his character's death scene in the original.  I hope that Televisa corrects this in future, in addition to making these abridgements longer.  If they aren't going to release novelas in their complete form, they should never be less than 20 (non-commercial) hours long.",1149984000,20,1390,5.074561403508772

I loved this novela and it's supposed to have 135 episodes at almost an hour each!
