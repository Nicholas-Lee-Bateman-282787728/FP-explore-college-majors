4445074,4,B004QC6HH8,"David Byrne is one artist that my Father and I bond over. This was a great Father's day present and it was an interesting look into the origins of the tour as well as providing insight from each of the touring members. It is a good mixture of live footage and interviews and the cinematography matched the performance. Certainly not as classic as Stop Making Sense but then again, what is?",1311033600,,389,4.492957746478873
4445075,2,B004QC6HH8,"Trouble is, the way the dsic was authored, you can't skip the dull maw yapping from an assortment of contributors. It's a pity that you simply can't take the concert in and be surprised by what Byrne had on offer. Clearly the work of a guy who needs other Heads to tell him, Look, Mr Renaissance, let the music and dance do the talking.
My wife's reaction was that the film was boring and the others looked bored silly. Stop Making Sense this isn't. Maybe on a second pressing, DB will rethink the value of explaining how he downloaded files Eno emailed to him. Oy. I'm guessing this was shot in NYC. He looks like he's singing and playing to record exec types in the front row, who are just standing there watching him. There are the usual Jonathan Demme knock off film angles that make an ever energetic group of band and dancers look exhausted. Seems they did this in a theatre with no a/c.
Honestly, I can figure out dance. I don't need the choreographer telling me how difficult it was to take static props like a mikc and make them dynamic dance partners.
There are much better DB concert films - notably the one shot in the church in England. This is a really good concert undermined by a talking head. Note to David: explaining dance is like explaining a joke. You've killed it, mate. Now get back on your bike.",1310342400,12,1319,4.409836065573771
4445076,5,B004QC6HH8,"Probably one of the best music documentaries i have seen. I am a very big admirer of David Byrne, but take that aside and you have a very well putt together piece of work.

4445077,3,B004QC6HH8,"I think that the decision to bookend each song with documentary excerpts was a blunder. Not only is the impact of the performances reduced, but it also becomes somewhat tiresome. In addition some of the song selections are poor. For example, 'Road to Nowhere' is not a B.Eno/D.Byrne track, and 'Life during Wartime' is mediocre in this performance. I can only assume they were included because they are recognisable to more people. However, there are some great performances, 'Houses in motion', 'Once in a lifetime' and 'I Feel My Stuff'",1308700800,6,538,4.988888888888889
4445078,5,B004QC6HH8,"During the tour which is the subject of this documentary (and for those who have complained, it -is- a documentary, not a concert film), Jon Pareles, chief music critic for The New York Times, wrote a review after having seen the Radio City Music Hall show.  In it, Pareles commented that he thought the dancers in the show were a distraction. David Byrne, for his part, wrote a scathing rebuttal in his blog, in which he said, among other things, ""I guess 30 years from now (Pareles)'ll figure out what this show was about.""

In Ride, Rise Roar, Byrne says that when he came up with the idea to use dancers as part of the show, he wasn't sure how the audience would react, but he was looking forward to finding out.  Having seen three of the tour's shows at the time, I didn't fully get what the dancers were about, but thought the shows were great.  As you watch RRR, Byrne, the choreographers, the dancers, and the musicians all take turns explaining how the show was conceptually put together song by song. By the end you do get a much better sense of ""what this show was about"".

This is a great documentary.  The concert footage is at times more effective than Stop Making Sense, and the picture and sound quality are nothing short of unbelievable. Sit back, crank the volume up on your surround sound system, and let the creative force that is David Byrne launch a full on assault on your senses.",1307491200,15,1403,4.482352941176471
4445079,5,B004QC6HH8,"Modern dance and pop music can complement each other.  Who knew?  The performances on RRR show musicians and dancers performing together, but not always in their traditional roles.  You see dancers imitating the musicians- and musicians imitating the dancers.  The tension brings energy to the performances.  At one point, a dancer jumps over Byrne's head!  Everyone gets a chance to explain their experience- how the backup singers felt when they were asked to move, how the choreographers interpreted the songs,  even how the musicians let the dancers guide their improvizations!  But the video contains much more music than, well, talking heads.

The songs are presented in their full length, although the video sometimes cuts between the live performance and rehearsals.  If you caught the tour, you know how great it was.  If you didn't catch the tour, this is the next best thing.  Byrne is still in excellent voice, and he rocks that tutu!

4445080,4,B004QC6HH8,"I was looking forward to this DVD having been to the show in 2008.  For those not lucky enough to see it, David Byrne put together quite a show - great songs from his CD ""Everything That Will Happen Will Happen Today"" (that he collaborated on with Brian Eno). The show also focused on other Eno-Byrne tracks from the Talking Heads 70's-80's albums.  Byrne added several dancers to the stage for these shows and the results were pretty interesting - definitely a visual show rather than just an audio experience.  The DVD however is edited quite heavily and omits several songs played on the tour and in between the songs (fortunately no songs are cut) there is some backstage and behind the scenes footage.  It's obviously just my opinion but this footage would have made for a nice bonus feature instead, and having more of the concert without editing would have been a little better.  Some of the backstage footage admittedly is interesting as sometimes it introduces the songs, but for me the concert feels a little too chopped up.  The DVD is still really great to have though - the sound and picture are both good and the footage is pretty cool - apparently shot with advanced hand held cameras.  So, I'll go with four stars - if the DVD was a little longer and included more songs it could have been five.  There are some great songs performed on this tour that were left off for some reason, notably ""Strange Overtones"", ""Help Me Somebody"" ""My Big Hands"", ""Wanted For Life"" and ""Born Under Punches"".  This might have made for a long theatrical release but all would have been great to have as bonus tracks for this DVD.",1306972800,37,1626,4.598615916955017

Now about the video.  I've always liked the tight stage space Byrne's DVDs tend to have.  The camera stays close.  The dancer's choreography is oddly sensual.  That one's hard to explain.  Watch and see.  You're here for the music anyway.

This DVD is great.",1352678400,,847,4.312101910828026
4445086,5,B004QC6HH8,"Art is very subjective: if you are not a David Byrne fan (I am) or Brian Eno fan (I am), then I can't tell you that you will
dig this DVD (you might or you might not). With that caveat:

When I had heard David Byrne was touring in 2009 after a collaboration with Brian Eno,I knew that I shouldn't miss that opportunity.
The concert did not disappoint.  The music/dance combo reminded me of Phish at Clifford Ball (Tweezer), and I was amazed at the
choreography which made the dancers appear to move randomly although there was never a ""lull"": the dancers always knew what to do.
The white wardrobe seemed to give a very relaxed feeling, and blended well with the funky performance (BTW, thanks David, I got to
see you do Crosseyed and Painless two full years before I finally got to see Phish's version. Apparently missing Cities and Xeyed and
Painless by a show or two during 1.0 was pretty common for me. The opening you put on that song was very cool).

Ride Rise Roar, which was shot very well, definitely gave great insight into the production of this tour. It is very reasonably priced,
demonstrates the seamless mixing of two art forms and gives a good balance between older TH/Eno songs and the newer DB/Eno songs.

The only detraction: how the heck does Strange Overtones not make it onto the DVD? I'm glad I got to see that live...",1351382400,,1341,4.483606557377049
4445087,2,B004QC6HH8,"I give five stars to David Byrne, the band, and the choreographers and dancers for a great performance.  The music and innovative dancing are great. Unfortunately the director/editor didn't choose to show the performance, but decided instead to slice it into 1 second shots from all over the place, so we can rarely ever see what's happening on stage. INFURIATING to try to watch a show edited like this, and it does a great disservice to the dancers and choreographers because we don't get a chance to really see what they are doing like the live audience got to see. So a 5 star show is lowered to a 2 star video, ruined by bad editing.",1345161600,11,638,4.5
4445088,5,B004QC6HH8,"what a fabulous film . not only superb concert footage, but  with dancing and dancers to take your breath away, superbly complementing the byrne/eno songs and music.  what a wonderful memorial to the director hillman curtis : don't miss his strangely touching short films on his website.",1337731200,,287,5.085106382978723
4445089,2,B004QC6HH8,"This should have been a 4 or 5 star video. David Byrne put a lot of creativity and effort into making an acoustical and visual delight. From what I could get out of the video, it would have been visually wonderful. The dancers were young, graceful and exuberant. The musicians and singers were well choreographed too. However the cameras and editing were apparently done by people suffering from extreme ADHD. The camera cut back and forth and all over. Camera shots were pieced together without any concern for the stage production. One could almost never see what was actually happening. Byrne's Stop Making Sense video set the high water mark for live concert videos. The cameras and editing supported the music and stage productions. It was thrilling! Fred Astaire had it right when he always insisted that his dance numbers showed him full length without editing in the middle of the dance. Who ever did this should go back to film school and learn how to do it right. I am surprised David Byrne allowed this to be done to his work.

4445091,5,B004QC6HH8,"I love this DVD!  I am a huge Talking Heads fan, and I was impressed by Byrne's great selection of TH songs... Air, Great Curve, Houses in Motion, I Zimbra, and Heaven make it worth the price.  I love some of the newer stuff too, especially Life Is Long!

Nice sound quality, and solid filming. My only complaint is about the length.  They could have fit at least 5 more sings on the disc.  I know other bands, like Phish, put 3 hours of music on one DVD.

If you love the ""The Name Of This Band Is Talking Heads"" CDs, you will love this DVD.  I would recommend this DVD over the Austin City Limits if you have to choose between the two.",1331596800,,637,4.088709677419355
4445092,4,B004QC6HH8,"The music of David Byrne is funky, innovative, rhythmic and engaging. He approaches his music as an art form and therefore keen to explore innovative and expressive dance routines to complement the music. The choreography is fascinating how the two lady choreographers melded the dance in with the music. Even the backup singers were drawn in although not comfortable at times.
The program is mixed with interviews and insights as to how the production was all pulled together. This information is interesting but I would have preferred it to have been separated as bonus material and not interspersed between each song. Also, if you removed the interviews the program is only a tad over 1 hour in length which makes the production quite short.
Nevertheless it was still worth buying the blu-ray.",1328572800,,796,5.037878787878788
4445093,4,B004QC6HH8,"With David Byrne's creative talent and back catalog, it would be difficult for him to record a bad live concert. Unfortunately, the same creative bent that leads to such great music detracts from this particular DVD. Here he has a vision wherein he gathers  professional dancers and allows them to interpret the music and perform with him (often taking center stage, literally, in lieu of the band.) Me, I'd prefer to see the band, not the dancers.

That said, the band occasionally gets star billing, and when they do the show is spectacular. As one would expect, they're incredibly tight, and Byrne continues to surprise with his fine voice and fit & youthful look. And needless to say, it's a joy to see him perform the tracks off his latest collaberation with Brian Eno, ""Everything That Happens Will Happen Today.""

The audio quality is wonderful, the video and editing crisp, and the interviews & practice sessions in advance of the show give us a chance to see Byrne chat & perform in a relaxed atmosphere. In total it's very good... just too many dancers, and not enough band for me. But if you're a fan, you will NOT be disappointed. Well, much, anyway...",1326153600,,1164,4.724137931034483
4445094,5,B004QC6HH8,"Outstanding film.

Byrne is terrific and the performances were captivating.  The unique blend of music and modern dance made for an audiovisual feast.  Concert footage brought you into the performance in ways not possible if attended live.  As much as I enjoyed the performances, my favorite parts were the insights into the creative process and glimpses into the performers' off-stage personalities.

4445095,5,B004QC6HH8,"David Byrne, once boyish and gawky, and a strangely remarkable stage prescence, is now so seasoned as a live performer, he is an absolute pleasure to watch.  The shortcoming of this film is that you cannot jump right to the beginning of songs, which makes it difficult to share highlights, and forces you to fast forward through interview segments when re-watching and wanting to see particular songs, or just skip the interviews.

The interviews are fine, just not what I want to watch over and over, though the songs...

Byrne assembled an amazing group of musicians and dancers to stage this tour.  The bass player is remarkable in both holding down the tunes and filling-out the sound.  There are some extremely pleasing tweaks on classic Talking Heads tunes, and Byrne's guitar-playing is phenomenal.  Adrian Belew once called Byrne one of the greatest but least appreciated guitarists in rock.",1322006400,,899,5.04054054054054
4445096,4,B004QC6HH8,"This was really a unique and fantastic show when I saw it over 2 years ago. The DVD presentation brought back great memories and I enjoyed meeting the rest of the dancers and musicians involved in the production. Having seen the show, the DVD does not present the flow of the original performance, rather showing only a few numbers between periods of off stage footage. Regrettably, a lot of great songs were omitted. A bonus disc would have been nice.",1320278400,,452,4.6625
4445097,5,B004QC6HH8,"A good friend treated me to a show in Berkeley during this tour, and normally I'd have been dancing from start to finish; the problem was-a few days earlier, I'd had a traumatic crash while bicycling, with a trip to the ER.  Assuming my wounds had been properly diagnosed and treated, though bruised & achy, I was unwilling to forgo the concert, but ended up hurting so badly, all I could do was lie down, restlessly trying to find a comfortable position...very disappointing.  After another week of torture, I returned to the Emergency Room, got an X-ray, & found out my right clavicle had fractured, so I'm thrilled to have this DVD...",1320278400,,637,4.678571428571429
4445098,5,B004QC6HH8,"This is once ""concert DVD"" that really took me by surprise. But a VERY pleasant one! I have only seen David Byrne play on music videos by his former band Talking Heads and in the Jonathan Demme filmed TH concert ""Stop Making Sense"". So I expected a ""making of a concert"" film when I popped this DVD into my player. Was I ever wrong!

I'm a big fan of modern dance and attend a lot of performance by modern dance groups. If you are a dance fan, you'll definitely want to see this film.

The concept of the project being documented in this film is the 2008 tour that Byrne put together after his new album of David Byrne-Brian Eno songs was finished. Byrne chose three young modern dance choreographers to choreograph the songs - both old TH standards like ""Burning Down The House"" and ""Once In A Lifetime"" along with newer compositions. He then auditioned to find three young dancers (two women and a man). But it wasn't just the three dancers who are dancing in this film - pieced together from three performances in California, Virginia and Albany, NY. The three backup singers (some of who also play instruments) get dance as well. (You can see from the brief rehearsal footage included that this really was - as one puts it - ""boot camp"" for them.)

In one clever number the dancers, singers and Byrne (who also does some wonderful dance moves as he sings and plays) sit on moving chairs through the full number. This is contrasted with the audience who were watching in a ""standing only"" venue!

The rehearsal footage is seamlessly edited with the concert footage making the production even more exciting. And the ""talking interview"" sections are brief allowing you to watch this as a concert film on repeat viewing.

I must admit that I loved TH's performances and Byrne and Eno's music but never quite understood the meaning of the lyrics. One of the choreographers says the same thing and reveals that she only thought of the rhythm. Then near the end - in a short interview with Byrne and Eno - Byrne reveals that the words ""have no real meaning. Like the music (he) uses them for effect!"".

While some Byrne music fans may gripe that a song or two was missing from this concert tour, the film will appear to a wider audience, opening up his music to the large audience for modern dance. And maybe it will convince some TH fans to check out a modern dance performance in their area. Not a bad idea!

4445099,3,B004QC6HH8,"I love the music. The dancers do not much for me. One dancer tells a story about how cool it was that David nastily chewed out a security guard at the show for telling fans they could not take pictures. Poor rent-a-oop trying to feed his kids being abused by a rock star. Wonderful!

4445100,5,B004QC6HH8,"My brother and I loved experiencing this tour at Brisbane's Convention Centre in February 2009. We were sitting right up the back (and to the side). From there the whole show sounded big and beautiful, and the choreography (complimented by excellent lighting) made me 100% aware that I was experiencing pure unique showbusiness - something very special indeed. From the back of the venue this was a show that made use of the whole stage, and almost all of the time.

So the wonderful thing about this Blu-ray is that I now have a complete impression of the show - the close-ups I could only imagine, the entertaining background story, and perfect surround sound. I am very happy with the way this film proves the value and integrity of the show, and gives us an insider appreciation of the intricacies involved.

I like the comment made by the male dancer about David Byrne aggressively berating a security guard who was trying to confiscate a punter's camera - having already made it clear to the security people that punters could take as many photos as they liked. (The complete opposite of Placebo at the same venue a few years earlier, when Brian Molko spotted the red glow of a camera LED, stopped the show, brought up the house lights and demanded that security eject the poor guy with the camera).

David Byrne doesn't ever do a half-arsed job. I strongly recommend ""David Byrne: Ride Rise Roar"" to anyone who attended this tour - and to anyone who is a fan of his music and art.",1312416000,2,1487,4.625

For entertainment value and a concert film Stop Making Sense blows this away.  I would only lay the money out if you're a completest and have to see it for yourself.
