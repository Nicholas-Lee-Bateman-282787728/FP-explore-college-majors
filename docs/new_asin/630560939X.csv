No real  outstanding stars, but, Charles Dance has a field day with his  interpretation of the Phantom. The ending had all the women in my family  weeping. The DVD has excellent color.....too bad they coudn't have  remastered it in 5:1, but the standard surround will do. Don't get this  confused with the Andrew Loydd Webber version. This version has some very  good opera, although the dubbing could have been better. All in all a good  3 hour film, with lots of fun for everyone.",941414400,7,623,4.609090909090909

1082495,5,630560939X,"I loved this TV movie when it originally aired. Charles Dance is my favorite filmed Phantom. He brought a sensitivity and humor to the role that I loved. Teri Polo was very good as Christine.. I just wish they had stuck closer to the original novel and musical. Changing Raoul to his elder brother Philippe and having Carlotta as one of the co-managers were the main weaknesses. Overall, this is my favorite filmed version of the story.",1344384000,,436,4.675324675324675
1082496,4,630560939X,"I must say as an avid Phantom of the Opera fan I did enjoy this movie. It offered a nice variety on the original Gaston Leroux story without departing too much from the original tale. I thought Charles Dance was a likeable Phantom. A bit too soft/nice for my taste, but he did a good job acting wise. I would say this is the most mild version of the Phantom I have seen. There is a LOT of opera singing in this movie, so if you hate Opera, be forewarned. I know, the title IS POTO so there is is bound to be opera singing, but there was a bit much if you ask me. I was very impressed with how the actual Opera house was incredibly accurate! It looks EXACTLY like the real Opera House in Paris! Good movie, I liked it. It didn't particularly move me as other Phantom movies did. I balled my eyes out more than once watching the Gerard Butler Phantom movie. That one is better than this by a long shot, but if you're a Phantom addict like me then this was a nice variety on the story.",1299974400,,982,4.06701030927835
1082497,5,630560939X,"5 stars all the way for the writer of this version and to actors Charles Dance,Teri Polo and Burt Lancaster! They were all just incredibly talented and moving in this production of Phantom that it leaves me speechless for words to describe just how extraordinary these actors all were in this touching version. This is indeed my favorite version aside from the original Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford one. Charles Dance was perfect as Phantom Erik and Teri Polo was just superb as Christine Daee. Burt Lancaster was absolutely moving as Erik's father and brought lots of warmth and sympathy to the role. The ending is a real tear-jerker when poor Erik is shot in this version and Christine truly loves Erik so much to the point where she removes his mask to look at him once more up close before he dies in his father's arms. This movie will really make you feel. I highly recommend this version. One of the very best ever!",1286236800,,929,4.636363636363637
1082498,1,630560939X,"Two+ hours of my life I will never get back... even Burt Lancaster could not save this slow, poorly dubbed (during the operatics) version of the Phantom, though he tried his best. There were a few good moments, but getting to them through the rest it was hardly worth it.",1234310400,,271,4.44
1082499,5,630560939X,"I can not describe how much I love this version of phantom. To say I am in love with Charles Dance as the phantom is a serious understatement. He is the sweetest most romantic phantom ever! As much as I love Michael Crawford (the second best phantom ever), and Gerard Butler, they do not compare to Charles. You never see Erik's deformity in this version, which I think was a good idea. It leaves it totally to you're imagination. I even liked Christine in this version,(except for at the end of a certain picnic scene!) which is big for me, as I usually can't stand her.

This film mad me laugh at one minute, and bawl my eyes out the next. It's absolutley fantastic! If you want to see a version of phantom with a very loveable phantom, where there is some love between him and Christine, then this is the version for you. It is also clear in this version that Erik loves Christine too, and isn't just an insane stalker. It is worth every penny, you will not regret it!!!",1214956800,2,973,4.346153846153846
1082500,3,630560939X,"Warning - this DVD is a little deceptive - Please read below.  The first paragraph focuses on disappointments in the manufacturing quality.  The second focuses on reviewing the movie itself.

These complaints may not bother you, but you should be aware of them before purchasing.  This Phantom of the Opera Miniseries DVD is a bootleg from Korea.  (Don't worry, it is still in English.  There are Korean subtitles that can be turned off.)  Here is how I know it's a bootleg:  1) There is no company logo for a DVD manufacturer or distributer anywhere on the box.  2) The quality of the movie is that of a brand new VHS recording in SP mode.  (That is to say, it looks as good as if it had been taped on your VHS deck yesterday, but it certainly is not as good as a professionally manufactured DVD.)  3) The DVD cover.  I don't even know where to start here there is so much to comment on... The DVD cover is NOT the same as pictured in some of the amazon pictures.  That image of the Phantom is an insert within a black border with cheap homemade comments photoshoped on top of it, like ""Best Seller"" and ""Gaston Leroux"", or my personal favorite - a quote from the New York Times review of a theatrical performance of Phantom that took place in Florida.  Yep - that's right - they put a quote on the cover that has nothing to do with this movie - it mentions stage actors from a local Florida theatre rather than the actors in this movie!!  Whoever threw together this packaging could not even find a quote from a review of the same movie with the same actors!!!  Last, the pictures on the back of the packaging are cheap VHS screen captures, photoshoped together.  I am pointing these things out because many of the sellers on amazon are advertising this DVD as ""New"", ""Unopened"", or ""Hard to find"".  The truth is that the official manufactured DVD of this movie is out of print and hard to find, and as of 6/8/08, I don't think any amazon sellers currently have it.  This bootleg is cheap, and although it is the only version you can find, you can find it easily.  It is not new, it is not hard to find, and you should not pay much for it!!

Now if you are ok with all the previous issues, let's move onto the movie itself.  I had seen this back when it aired on television, and was already a fan.  This movie is an adaptation of the Kopit/Yeston staged musical.  The way it happened was this... Kopit & Yeston wrote their musical called ""Phantom"".  Then Lloyd Webber announced he was opening his musical of Phantom in England.  Kopit & Yeston felt with Lloyd Webber's version coming out, their's wouldn't be able to compete.  So they cut all their songs, added scenes of the actual operatic productions that were mentioned in the novel, and turned it into this miniseries movie.  After a number of years, they did end up releasing their original musical version, and it has been performed in smaller theatres since the 90s.  If you want to hear the songs that were originally part of the script of this movie, you can buy the soundtrack here on amazon.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phantom-The-American-Musical-Sensation-1992-Studio-Cast/dp/B000003FGT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phantom: The American Musical Sensation (1992 Studio Cast)</a>&nbsp;But back to this movie... Parts of it are filmed in some of the real locations of the Paris Opera House, so it has a very historical feel to what the locations and the productions would have felt like.  This version is not close to the novel Phantom of the Opera at all - it really re-imagines the whole story of the Phantom and Christine.  I won't give away what they change, but they really do investigate some interesting, and very touching, ideas about where the Phantom came from and why he is where he is.  I really enjoy this version, with one exception.  I feel the way they reworked the unmasking of the Phantom's face to Christine was a complete failure - it lost all the power of the original or other versions.  It felt like they wanted to do something different for the sake of doing something different, and it just didn't build up enough of a reason for Christine's horrific reaction.  But that is my one complaint - 1 negative scene out of 189 minutes isn't bad.

So all in all, I would recommend one to see this movie, but I would caution you to realize it is not a high-quality DVD from a technical/quality standpoint.  The true movie collector may want to wait to see if they ever re-release this officially in the future.",1212883200,2,4537,4.6616352201257865
1082501,5,630560939X,"The best Phantom of the Opera ever.  Music of the opera  ""Faust"" and traditional French songs is great.  Wonderful to find this movie again, after being unavailable for so many years. (Great to use with French students in high school.)",1200528000,2,235,4.825
1082502,5,630560939X,"I bought this version of The Phantom of the Opera to expand my experiance with a story and characters I adore, and all through the first half I was deeply indifferent to the story. I mean, I have to admit, I LOVED the character of Erik as portrayed by Charles Dance: I mean he was witty, crafty, intelligent, but very down to earth and real; But the character of Christine started very weak, as did Raoul - excuse me, Phillipe. However, I loved how Carlotta was portrayed from beginning to end, and the second half of the series just blew me away. I fell completely and madly in love (again) not only with the Phantom himself, but with the romance between the masked gentleman and Christine, and I found myself left with a very hopeful ending that leaves quite a few possibilities. I also thought the developement involving the previous manager of the opera house was quite interesting, and a lovely twist.

This series was possibly THE best Phantom of the Opera version I have EVER seen, even better than the 2004 edition starring Gerard Butler; I definitely recommend this movie if you love both the Phantom as a character and music in it's operatic form.",1175904000,4,1157,4.616504854368932

I had worn our my TV VHS tape from the 90's.  Commercials and all it is heads above any other film about this subject.  If you aren't an Opera fan, you will be.  If you aren't a musical fan, you will be.  If you've always thought of the Phantom as a horror film, you will learn that it is pure romance and love.  This is the one that should win the Oscars and every other award there is to win.  Not one other film can compare to it.",1140220800,7,586,3.906779661016949
1082517,5,630560939X,"Words can't even describe how much I love this Phantom Of The Opera film! When my mother borrowed it from the library back in 2003, I was a bit skeptical to watch it because before watching this one, the only other one I saw which was in the 90's, was some horror version which I think was Dario Argento's version and it was so boring and the main storyline bored me. I hated it so I wasn't jumping for joy when I saw that my mom had borrowed this 1990 version. I know if I started with the Lon Chaney version, I would have been more excited because even though the Lon Chaney version isn't my favorite, it's a good film and I do like it but at least I've seen it since this 1990 one and that's all that matters. I then just decided and took a chance and watched it and man did I totally fall in love with it!! As a matter of fact, my mom had it for a couple of weeks and I saw it at least once a day until she had to return it. It became this daily thing and then right after she took it back, I ordered my own copy and have now seen it over 100 times and never get bored of it. This is the most romantic, passionate and emotional Phantom Of The Opera I've ever seen!!! Why, this is the most romantic, passionate and emotional movie I've ever seen!! I've seen many other versions since this and no other Phantom or any movie for that matter, could even hold a candle to this masterpiece!!!

Charles Dance, who is now my favorite actor of all time because of this movie, is the best Phantom ever!! Forget Lon Chaney, which I've seen, forget Claude Rains who've I've also seen, forget Michael Crawford (who've I've heard from the cast recording and seen a whole bunch of videos of him from Phantom since 2003 which I know isn't a whole lot but just from what I've heard and seen, I still love Charles the most), Robert Englund and even Gerard Butler who've I've seen too because Charles Dance is the most romantic, passionate, sweetest Phantom ever and no one and I mean NO ONE could ever do a better job than Charles!!! Don't get me wrong, I like all the Phantoms I listed above, I'm just emphasizing how much I really love Charles!!! I didn't even know about Charles Dance until 2003 when I saw this magnificent film!!! The most romantic scene is between Erik and Christine who is played by Teri Polo (Meet The Parents/Fockers) on this picnic and I love everything he says and does and I can't stop watching that scene over and over again. I totally love the clothes he wore during that picnic scene and really impresses me! Why can't there be men out there today that dresses like that? There is also a couple really sad scenes with The Phantom/Charles which I won't give away but I start to cry every time I see them. If I didn't know better, I would say Charles Dance/The Phantom is really in love with Teri Polo/Christine because Charles makes it look like he really loves her especially this one sad part where he's crying that actually makes me cry too, he really makes me feel and see his pain. I just have totally fallin' in love with this movie and Charles Dance as an actor and it's because of this movie and of course Charles' sexy British accent which I totally love, that I've bought other Charles Dance movies that I never saw until I got them.

The Phantom's father Gerard Carriere who is played by Burt Lancaster (Field Of Dreams) is really good also. Just last year, I found out that Burt Lancaster had passed away over 10 years ago from a heart attack and I still feel sad about it because he did a wonderful job as Erik's father and in other movies like Field Of Dreams and it's just so sad knowing that he's not even alive anymore! And in this film, Christines' love is not Raoul but Phillipe who is played by Adam Storke (The Stand). I will say this: If I were Christine, I would have picked Erik because Charles Dance makes him so romantic and passionate and even with the mask on, he is so handsome and the most important parts are his mouth and eyes so I would have definitely picked Charles Dance/The Phantom. Carlotta is very funny is this film also, especially in the Opera scenes, it's so hilarious!

I love the music and the dialog and the singing and even though the singing parts were dubbed, it's amazing. Mich&egrave;le Lagrange, who did the singing for Christine/Teri Polo has one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard.

In this film, the following Operas/excerpts were featured:

GOUNOD: Faust

VERDI: La Traviata

BELLINI: Norma

There is this one scene where Christine sings at the Bistro and the Opera piece that Christine sings is called ""Par le rang et par l'opulence"" from ""La Fille du Regiment"" (the daughter of the regiment) by DONIZETTI. Hearing these Operas have made me start really getting into Opera and has made me buy real Operas on CD and soon, will have all the Operas on CD that were featured in this film. The Operas sound incredible!

But what really gets me every time in this film is Charles Dance's performance as The Phantom Of The Opera!! I am completely taken by Charles as an actor and there will never be a better Phantom than Charles!! Never!!!

This Phantom film is my all time fav along with the 2004 one but if I had to choose between the two, it's so obvious which one I would ultimately pick: Charles Dance!!! If only I could find a man who dresses the way that Charles/The Phantom dressed during that picnic scene and was as romantic, I would be in heaven!!!

One more thing: This film version actually was filmed in The Paris Opera House in France!

And no one and I mean NO ONE could ever love Charles Dance/The Phantom or wish that they were Christine as much as I do!!! Never!!!",1127260800,24,5660,4.369771863117871
1082518,5,630560939X,"This was probably the very best Phantom of the Opera movie I have ever seen. It was worth every cent! My purchasing experience wasn't the greatest because it took about two weeks for it to actually be shipped to the states...but once again, it was worth it...I would go through the waiting again, simply because this movie was so wonderful. You should buy it...even if it is pricey... :)",1125792000,8,387,4.6231884057971016
1082519,4,630560939X,"Even though this mini-series is not even close to the original Leroux novel (has there ever been one similar?) I liked it. Sure there were some parts I didn't like but, for the most part it was good. The ending was way off but, I enjoyed it. Instead of Vicomte de Chagny there is now Count de Chagny and he goes by the name Phillipe (in the novel this is Raoul's brother). It explains how they met in their childhood and Phillipe is in some ways like the Phillipe in the novel. Instead of hearing an Angel of Music the Phantom offers singing lessons in person and tells her he wears the mask because he wants to be anonymous (which in my opinion is much more believable). Carlotta is married to the new manager and you kinda find out why Erik (the phantom) is deformed. Christine does fall in love with Erik and it seems happy until his unmasking. Unlike most movies where you see his face, you never see Erik's which in a way is fitting and left to your own imagination. I don't think they could make a face that would meet the expectations of many of the ""phans"". Also like the Susan Kay version it goes more into detail on why Erik becomes so obsessed with Christine. I am very picky with phantom stuff and liked this! So I highly suggest all ""phans"" see this version.",1123545600,10,1271,4.322175732217573
1082520,4,630560939X,"Me, being a Phantom fan, I just had to track this one down. It wasn't easy, but I found an Asian copy of it on e-bay (you should go there if you'd rather not trace it down, like I did) I've never seen it before, but I watched it with an open mind. After all, this is The Phantom of the Opera. What's not to love?

The sets and basic feel of the movie seemed more like a Soap Opera, to me.. And all in all, it was one big Soap Opera. Erik got depressed easily, upset, and angered. But Erik is supposed to be that way, and this is the only film that really brought out that side of them.

This movie is actually based on a Maury Yeston musical. The musical-part has been dropped though, but the story is the same. I didn't really agree with that, but I was open minded enough to over look it. Erik's father was the manager? who shot his own son? And Erik's mother happened to be Christine's 'twin'? Now, I think it is a big over dramatized, but it has many good aspects, don't worry.

The scenes between Erik and Christine are to die for. You knew that he loved her, and didn't want to hurt her, and that was obvious enough. I am a Webber fan, and adore the musical to pieces, but this is almost as good, in my opinion.

There's love, there's romance, and heartbreak. It's another Phantom of the Opera, that you'll be sure to love",1120780800,15,1328,4.115830115830116
1082521,5,630560939X,"I was blowen away by this film. I mean its an awsome film. Also the cast was amazing. Charels Dance(The phantom) , and Teri Polo(Christine Daae) were great. Same goes with the sets and costumes. I'm a POTO phan and I noticed that this is the only POTO when they actaully show Raul's brother Philippe and hes pretty cute too. But they don't show Raul. So she falls in love with his brother Philippe. In other words instead of Raul and Christine it the other way around.

Anyway moving on with the movie Charels Dance is a great Phantom. Oh one more thing , they change the story around a little. Instead of the foumus Masquerade Ball its a Bestro. So just to perpare you for no beautiful Masquerade Ball. So I deffently give it 5 stars. Now that you read my review go out and buy it trust me it worth it.

1082522,5,630560939X,"This version is a Kopit/Leroux mix. It is very different from Webber's version, but not so different you wouldn't enjoy it. No raised by rats, or ripping off of flesh. (per other films)

This Erik is drawn to Christine by seeing and hearing his beloved dead mother thru her.  He is supported and hidden at the Opera with help of the manager- his father, until he is replaced. What is Erik to do now? Although this Erik too has desperation, darkness, and loneliness, he is able to keep a sense of humor and extreme charm. He is tender and careful to keep his distance from his beloved Christine, but for how long? More of Roul's story is unfolded in this version. And Christine makes her declaration of love willingly. You may be surprised and oddly happy with this ending. I highly recommend this version to any Phantom Phan! Next to Webber's you will want this in  your library.

1082553,5,630560939X,"I saw the broadway show three times, and the ALW movie numerous times.  I recently became a fan of the Phantom of the Opera.  I recently read the original book and am now collecting the different versions of the movie.  It amazes me how there can be so many different interpretations of the book.  This is my second favorite version because the ALW's version has the best music and it creates such different emotions when the phantom is handsome.  This is my second favorite version.  It shows the childhood connection between Raoul and Christine, therefore, I felt I could understand the love between them even more.  Also, the scene of the forest of the phantom's world was well shown.  I read fast so sometimes it is hard for me to imagine what Gaston Leroux was describing in the original novel.  The opera ""Faust"" was really good.  But, I like this version's of why he became the Phantom.  It was different from the original novel, but it was a good interpretation.  I actually cried in this movie, and I hardly cried ever.  I think if you are a parent, then it may make you cry too.  Charles Dance really gave an outstanding performance in the end.  I don't want to give too much of this movie away.  I bought this movie from e-bay from a seller from Australia.  It took me several times and I finally won the bid.  I paid $5.95AUD, $10.00AUD S&H.  The total was $15.95AUD(12.95 USD).  It was advertised new, but the sealed was not on the DVD when it arrived.  However, it played well.",1116720000,7,1491,4.50936329588015

A truly beautiful creation and luckily it's not the only piece of brilliant opera in the film, the singing is put into the context of the play and the acting is world class. I can not recommend it highly enough.",1115251200,2,372,4.328571428571428
1082555,5,630560939X,"When I first saw this version of The Phantom of the Opera, I was dazzled. I already loved classical music but I had never given any serious thought to learning how to sing until I heard Christine sing that beautiful song at the bistro. Ever since then I have been an avid opera fan.

At the present time I am a senior in college and I am giving my senior recital in November of 2005. However, I do not think my recital would be complete without a tribute to the one movie that encouraged me to live my dream and become a great singer. If anyone reading this knows what the name of the song was PLEASE e-mail me at chessleys@yahoo.com.

As for my review of this movie, I love it. I think it is a more realistic interpretation of Gaston's novel. In fact, I prefer it over Webber's musical, as lovely as it was. The audience is able to see the hidden, human elements that give the story life.

You are able to see Erik as more than just a monster. He's tortured, knowing that he can never have the things he deserves: love and recognition for his heartbreaking talent. Teri Polo presents the perfect picture of a woman torn between her emotions for one man and another. Carlotta's singing was wonderfully awful. I loved her. This movie will always be close to my heart.",1112227200,2,1266,4.3559322033898304

Charles Dance plays the Phantom so well, he will almost certainly capture your heart. I must admit some of his serious lines are laughable such as ""I call the place my dreamerie"", but you have to give the poor man a break, he was alone in the Paris Opera House for thirty years.

The screenplay, though very different from Gaston Leroux's story was refreshing, as it was told in such a way that you felt nothing but sympathy and pity for poor Erik(the Phantom), and concentrated around the opera Faust which in many ways is similar to The Phantom of the Opera.

The costumes were beautiful, and the singing superb. the characters had depth, with one exeption: Phillipe (aka Raoul) le vicompte de Chagny. He was just cowardly and a bit whiny. All in all a WONDERFUL movie. (I wouldn't be surprised if I'm in love with the Phantom too.)",1111536000,5,1068,4.494845360824742

1082558,4,630560939X,"If you are a fan of Charles Dance or a long-time lover of Leroux's novel (both of which I am), then I highly recommend this version.  As mentioned in another review, it does lean more towards the romantic angle than the mysterious.  The writers, as usual, have taken enough liberties with the plot and peripheral characters to raise some eyebrows, but the crucial components of Leroux have been preserved.  Erik is not some disgruntled and maimed former employee of the opera, but a recluse disfigured from birth, wishing only to be accepted for who he is and allowed to exercise his musical genius.  There are enough nicely chosen references to the novel peppered throughout the film to reassure that the writers were actually familiar with the book and made the effort to maintain ties to it.

The operatic lip synching ranges from passable to downright bad in some spots, and one could wish that the actors had been better coached in the physical carriage and movement of singing, and the meaning of the lyrics they are trying to convey.  Burt Lancaster and Teri Polo are at times jarringly and cheesily American in an otherwise entertaining cast, but they both have their moments.  Polo's Christine is not a young, nave girl clinging to her father's memory but a hopeful young woman trying to achieve her fondest goal of singing at the Opera.

Charles Dance is the gem in this production.  His Erik is slightly younger than Leroux's, more earthy and accessible; he and Christine meet face to face from Day One and have a more practical working relationship of teacher and pupil that quickly and respectfully turns to something more.  Dance achieves just the right blend of menace, confidence in his own genius and Erik's almost childish temper and disregard for knowing Right from Wrong when it interferes with his own wishes.  He keeps up a constant level of mischief throughout the film that is quite entertaining.  Don't expect another gruesome unmasking - we never see his face.  Given how filmmakers and theatre have never even come close to Leroux's description, this is fine by me.  The details of the disfigurement are not the real point of the story and are best left to imagination until someone decides to make a truly accurate film version of the book.

The centerpiece of this version is the opera house itself.  Filmed inside and around the Palais Garnier, the many aspects of the building from grand escalier to back rooms to cellars are well utilized and shown off to a very satisfying degree.  If this is as close as you ever get to visiting the real thing, it's darn good tour.",1109116800,8,2599,4.778523489932886
1082559,5,630560939X,"The TV series was an excellent adaptation of The Phantom of the Opera. It is a little more scenic and dramatic than some other plays and movies but the story is compelling and original. Charles Dance (The Phantom) does an excellent performance with his slow and methodical movements. Every time he approaches Christine he shows how intense his feelings are towards her and leaves you feeling breathless. Raul's character does not appear as much in this story as I would like but his presence is always felt. It was an interesting twist with the Phantoms father and the real life story behind how the phantom was created and his mother. All of these seperate stories are really never told in other plays and Movies.

Some of the other reveiws are to analytical about The Phantom movies and TV shows. They don't actually sit down and enjoy them for what they are; which is ""excellent entertainment"". I highly reccommend this one to any one whom wants a more romantic veiw of the story. This particular one is long but it leaves a sense of wonder at the end, Is he alive? or dead?",1105401600,17,1077,4.609375

I loved all 4 versions, probably because I take each version for what it is and don't agonize over trying to compare them. This TV miniseries is one of my favorites of all time - so glad it's on DVD since over the last 10 years we've worn out our VHS copy we taped from TV when it originally aired! The story is good, the Phantom is great, and the singing toward the end is emotional and touching.  If you want a good story based on the Phantom story, you won't be disappointed with this show.  It's a made-for-TV-movie so of course it's not going to be comparable to a musical stage production,which is OK.  It's a very good show!!!",1104105600,16,801,4.32
1082599,2,630560939X,"The DVD is 185 minutes long and was not what I expected. I watched the first 60 minutes, then scanned through the rest of the video looking for some indication of music. To my surprise, it is not a musical rendition of The Phantom Opera, it is merely a boring drama, slow moving, and lacking in the action of earlier versions. This story was mostly a psychological analysis of the Phamtom character and disclosed the fact that he was a musician himself. This version would be very good as a class assignment for a drama group, however, it's actual entertaiment value was not anywhere close to what I anticipated.

I'm sorry if this review seems excessivly harsh, and I won't end this without saying something more positive.

A condensed version of this video would be great for people to watch before attending the musical play. The story is very revealing about the Phantom, his past, his fears, and his reason for being reclusive. The story follows the play, absent music, and fills in many questions the audience may have about the specific characters. The Phantom is not portrayed so much as being evil, there is no horror, and his envolvment with Christine is more of being a musician and teacher. The musical rendition by Andrew Loyd Webber may be hard for some to follow and as I said, watching this video first might add to the enjoyment of actually seeing the stage musical.

Today, December 9, 2004, a screen version of Andrew Loyd Webbers musical was advertised on TV, as being released for theatre viewing. I can't wait for it to be released in DVD form.",1102464000,9,1566,4.666666666666667
1082600,5,630560939X,"This particular version of Phantom of the Opera ranks as my second favorite... right under the ALW musical of the same name.  Given that it was a made for TV miniseries and not a big screen motion picture with a massive budget, that's saying a lot.

While it does have some irksome bits... namely the replacing of Raoul with his elder brother from the original novel, Phillipe, as Christine's love interest (no mention of Raoul is even made, poor guy), and the slightly corny ""picnic in the forest scene"" in the Phantom's layer... overall it is a wonderful telling of the story.

The cast is masterful, and the musical score truely fitting.  The final scene on the roof of the opera house is especially noteworthy in it's depiction of sacrifice and emotion.  You won't go wrong with this DVD.  It portrays the Phantom as being very human at heart, and has some exceptionally touching moments.

As far as the DVD itself, the only complaint I can make is about the lack of extras (in fact the only extra on the disc is a ""trailer"" that looks more like a soundtrack-less scene compilation than anything else).  But given that it was a TV miniseries that was made well before DVDs, I suppose it should come as no real surprise that there are no cast and crew interviews or gag reels.

All in all, if you are a Phantom fan, buy this.  It is a lovely piece of work that I can honestly say (as I myself saw it on TV the first time when I was around 10 years old, and was astounded when I found that it had been released on DVD) you will never forget.",1102377600,12,1543,4.363636363636363
1082601,3,630560939X,"This is not a terrible version of the classic tale at all. I'm such a HUGE fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage version, so I tend to always compare the two. But without the comparison, it's not that bad. I liked that we get a lot of background on Erik's (The Phantom) past. Charles Dance played a nice Phantom, his vocals sounded menacing, yet soothing at the same time. I didn't like that the part of Raoul, was changed to 'Phillipe' (but here I am comparing again). Teri Polo (now of 'Meet the Parents' fame) plays a nice Christine and it's heartbreaking when Carlotta drugs her and she's booed off the stage. At three hours or so, this really is an epic version of 'The Phantom'. There are some great images... when Christine and Phillipe (eye roll) take a midnight carriage ride or when The Phantom leads Christine through his lair. The set is so different. It's forest-like with stuffed birds/deer etc... all over the place. Creepy... It was nice to see Burt Lancaster and he did a good job. It was an interesting twist to have the former Opera manager actually be the Phantom's father. I agree with another viewer. Where's the Masquerade ball? That's one of the most stunning sequences in all of Broadway history and should have been included. The end is kind of unnecessary and plays out more like a suspense thriller with a chase on the Paris Opera rooftops. All in all, though, this is a decent version and has it's virtues. We benefit from good performances (esp. by the actress portraying Carlotta) and a film version actually being shot in the famed Paris Opera House.",1099958400,,1579,4.622775800711744
1082602,4,630560939X,"I really like this movie.  It's one of the better movie adaptations of the Phantom (at least until we see the musical this December *crosses fingers*), however, it is a shame that it didn't stick to the original story.

I did like it on its own.  If you didn't know much about the story, then you would probably really enjoy the movie.  If you have read the story, and countless retellings of it, you may be dissapointed.

Raoul has a completely different name and he's the one who sent Christine to the Paris Opera house for singing lessons.  She was NEVER a dancer in this movie.  The old manager knew about Erik and kept him hidden in the Opera house rather than trying to hunt him down.  Carlotta is vain and foolish (which is a lot of fun) and is probably the closest to true character.  The Persian is nowhere to be found, although you could argue that the character of the Persian is grafted onto the old manager.

All in all, I do enjoy this movie.  The humor quotient is refreshing, the plot is plausible (sometimes a little shakey), and the characters are likeable.  And Erik actually acts like someone who has no human contact, he is a bit socially inept.

If you are a diehard of the original, you will be dissapointed.  If you can step outside of the original's shadow, then you might enjoy this movie for what it is: a take on a classic story, told for modern audiences.",1096848000,,1384,4.4189723320158105
1082603,5,630560939X,"While not the most accurate script (this movie is based off of the Yeston/ Kopit musical and not so much the novel by Leroux) I must admit this is my all-time favorite of the Phantom movies and the ONLY one I have seen that shows Erik in a similar light to Susan Kay's Phantom (which I adore). Charles Dance's voice grabs your attention from the first words he mutters to the final heart-wrenching scene. I thoroughly loved the back-story they created for Erik, seeing as he didn't have much of one in the original novel, and the inclusion of his father (Lancaster) while originally disconcerting was well-played out and fit in well with Charles' portrayal of Erik. It was Charles' Phantom that I fell in love with, it was Charles whom cemented by status as a Phan, and it is Charles who shall always be first on my list of Phantom loves.
My only real complaint about this movie is Christine....I swear, every time she said ""If you love me..."" I wanted to KILL her for being such a manipulating so-and-so. And Phillipe (Raoul) was a FOP if I've ever seen one, and quite the man-whore XD Pathetic!
Carlotta and her husband were a bundle of laughs and a much-needed reprive from Christine and her stupidity.
All I can say of the final Faust trio is this.....It makes me cry! I never thought I could ever really like opera at all until I heard and saw that scene. I get the shivers just thinking about it. *smiles* All in all, although it is not a loyal adaptation to the novel, it is by far the best of all the Phantom movies, save the Man of a Thousand Faces himself!

I liked the fact that we didn't see Erik's face when he showed it to Christine. That was a good move I believe.
However, there are some things about the movie that I didn't really enjoy. They could have  tried to get different actress for Christine and Erik's mother ( it's disturbing when you think about it.)
 I guess they didn't want to because they wanted to show exactly why Erik is so interested in Christine.
The twist of Erik's father being in the film was interesting and kind of disappointing at the same time.
 I liked the chemistry between the two actors. And you could tell that Erik's father does love his son.
However, again not really a Phantom plot line at all.
All and all though it was a very good attempt for a new Phantom film at the time.  My one thought is to try out Susan Kay's novel ""Phantom"". Another Phantom of the Opera retelling.
Very nice.
 This movie is good but not really on my favorite list any more. It's good for romance lovers that like semi sad themes , that aren't really well developed.

First of all, it is mostly filmed at the great place itself, the Palais Garnier Opera House. It is so lovely and beautiful, and quite the musical palace as it is said. It was lovely to see some of the scenes shot there, although the auditorium for some reason was under construction so it was NOT filmed there, I was told.
Second of all, the casting of the Phantom - Charles Dance. He is TRULY among the great three to portray the Phantom with such powerfulness. Lon Chaney Snr (1925 version of Phantom), Michael Crawford (1986-90 stage musical production), and then there is Charles Dance. He really makes it his own and I appreciate his gentle side as the Phantom, even though he is a bit on the dark side and quiet side.
The only complaint I had about the film was the singing of Christine and some of the costuming, but other than that IT WAS TRULY and IS WORTH SEEING!!!

The Phantom has a more human characteristics and doesn't seem so aloof, which in most plots and plays would be bad but it fits perfectly with this one.

Charles Dance gives an extrordinary performance as the Phantom and he plays the part so well that you can't help but love the character.
The movie starts out with Christine Daee walking to the Opera House in hopes of finding a person to give her singing lessons.  As it turns out, she was sent by a wealthy count to see the manager and recieve singing lessons.
The Manager, however, had been bought out by a different company.  The new manager does not listen to what the old manager has to say and dismisses the legends of an Opera Ghost as poppycock.  And that happens to be the first of his many mistakes.  His second one is ignoring what The Phantom says and the third is casting his wife, who can't sing, as the lead female.
The Phantom then hears Christine sing and he offers to give her singing lessons.  She then is heard at The Bistro where the manager of the Opera House casts her in the lead role.
This dosen't make his wife happy at all and therefore she sabatoges Christine's performance.
The Phantom then rescues Christine and takes her to his realm under the Opera House where she'll be safe.  He treats her well, loves her, and then she asks him to let her see his face.
He refuses and then she tells that she can love him regardless of what he looks like because she knows his heart and has seen his eyes.
When he removes the mask, she faints and therefore he thinks she dosen't love him.  When she tries to escape, he catches her and then puts her in a cage thing, which she busts out of and then runs above ground where the Count and the old manager happpen to be standing in the lobby when Christine comes out of a secret door. The count then gets her out and takes her to his Chateau where she is put to bed.  but she recieves a dream where she sees the Phantom dying and she knows that she has to go back.  The count does not aggree with her plan but she is insistent and so she sings the part of Margurite in Faust and the Phantom hears her.  He comes to his box and sings the lead male role and the people love him.  After the performance, he jumps onto the stage, grabs Christine and takes her to the roof where there is climatic finish where the phantom winds up dying and Christine winds up with the count.",1060128000,5,2393,4.235164835164835

The Phantom of the Opera's metamorphosis from an object of horror to a romantic hero can probably be credited to two extraordinary actors: Michael Crawford and Charles Dance. In this non-musical (unless you count that gorgeous duet from 'Faust') made-for-TV version, Dance's Erik has been reconfigured so that the beauty of his artist's soul encompasses his whole being, his disfigurement concealed behind a series of elegant masks. Tall and elegant, with a cat-like walk and a wry sense of humor, Dance does some of his most effective acting with his wonderfully expressive eyes. Moving effortlessly from swashbuckling action and urbane wit to heartbreaking vulnerability, his Erik is so magnetic that it seems incomprehensible that Terri Polo's brave and charming Christine would choose her childish, petulant boyfriend Raoul over him. Polo has some lovely and heartfelt scenes, especially her tearful farewell to Erik, and Burt Lancaster plays his father with a sad and gentle world-weariness that conveys his impending sense of doom. The production is opulent and, more than any other I've seen, brings the viewer inside the world of the great Paris Opera.

Charles Dance has expression and grace which adds to his portryal of Erik. I think the unmasking scene was handled wonderful-as you never see Erik's face. Due to this we only see a human Erik-not a crazy deformed murderer which makes a wonderful change. I believe some scenes are rather funny with Erik as he can be quite sarcastic especially concerning Carlotta. Erik is also shown to be loved in this version, by Christine and his father. The only faults are the lip synching to the opera and the one portrayal of Erik as unaccustomed to murder. But despite this it is still fantastic.

1082697,4,630560939X,"This two-part televison version of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is a mixed bag to be sure, but it does have its moments.  Clearly this is a post-Lloyd Webber version of ""Phantom,"" highlighting the romance between the title character (Charles Dance) and Christine (Terri Polo) even more than the Broadway show.  For once, the love triangle between teacher, pupil and Philippe (Adam Stroke), the Count de Chagny, is realistic; which is to say, Christine really has a choice between the two men who command her affection.  Of course, the paradox is that the more romantic a figure the Phantom becomes, the less he can be seen as a deadly maniac roaming at will through the Paris Opera House.  The result is that when this Phantom kills intruders into his subterranean realm, I found it hard to believe because it went against Erik's character (cf. the 1989 film version with Robert Englund of Freddy Krueger fame).
One of the strengths of the film is the use it makes of the opera part of the title.  There is a wonderful scene early when Christine has come to the big city and has joined the chorus of the Opera.  One evening she is signing at a local tavern and the managers of the Opera House convince Carlotta (Andra Ferrol), the egotistical diva, to go up and sign with the girl.  However, it does not take long for Christine to blow Carlotta away, and when the diva flees from the stage we have clear proof as to who has more talent.  The finale of the mini-series involves a production of Charles Gounod's ""Faust,"" which is one of the best uses of an opera in a film since a production of ""La Traviata"" popped up in ""Pretty Woman.""  The choice of ""Faust"" is a masterstroke, not just because the opera is actually sung in French, but because there are some strong parallels between the story of Faust and that of the Phantom.  This allows for a rather surprising and haunting use of the opera's climatic aria.
I know there will be strong disagreement on this score, but I also appreciated this version's approach to the Phantom's disfigurement.  There is a pivotal scene early on when Christine actually tries to persuade Erik to remove his mask, maintaining that she can look at whatever is beneath it with eyes of love.  When the mask is removed the focus is not on his face but rather on Christine's as she bases from shock to horror to senselessness.  It is that look, along with Erik's cry of anguish, that carries the scene.  More importantly, it sets up an even better scene at the end of the film.  That first scene is clearly influenced by the Broadway version, where the audience never sees the Phantom's face at that point, just Christine, rather than the immortal scene where Mary Philbin unmasked Lon Chaney in the classic silent version.  Meanwhile, the film's conclusion actually harkens back to Gaston Leroux's original novel with regards to how Christine conquers Erik.
Editing this film down a bit would certainly be helpful; the four-hour mini-series loses about an hour once you take out the commercials, but could benefit from losing another half-hour or so.  The performances are competent, with Dance evincing charm as the Phantom without a real undercurrent of menace.  Polo is a tad too emotional at time and has a lot of lip-synching to do with all the opera singing, but there is an earnestness that matches the character.  Stroke has the unenviable tasks of trying to convince both Christine and the audience that she should pick his character instead of the Phantom.  Most of the supporting cast are assigned various roles of comic relief with French accents, while Burt Lancaster gets to bring some dignity to the proceedings as the former manager of the Paris Opera House who knows more about the Phantom than anyone knows.
The key thing is that this 1990 version of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is not going to be the first one you view.  You have to see Lon Chaney's silent version and at least listen to the Broadway musical (paying copious attention to the libretto so you know exactly what is happening).  The 1943 Claude Reins film involving acid being thrown and music being stolen is optional.  But the more you are familiar with the various tellings of this tale, the more you can enjoy what writer Arthur L. Kopit and director Tony Richardson (""Tom Jones"").",1036454400,68,4297,4.7

I have seen the live opera/play version several times as performed by The Really Useful Theatre Company and adore it. (If you ever hear of them coming to perform near you, go at all costs)  This movie though, I can't say enough about it.  I saw it for the first time not long after it came out, but do to one thing or another, could never find out any info on it, even who played who.  Now that I have, I'm totally crazy to get it in my hot little hand.  I am NOT a sappy person, a bit romantic maby, but trust me, I'm a Harley riding, farm working, horse hauling, tom boy with little or no interest in most of the finer things.  But Opera, especially Phantom really gets me.  And this movie has everything I want and in my opinion, portrays the story to perfection.

I mean, any movie that can actually portray Erik as a good guy is okay by me and this movie did it in spades! It tells about his infancy, his childhood, his life. Plus, you really learn to hate the Raoul type character! He's a player in it! I mean you sit through it just begging for Erik and Christine to get together (or at least I was). Burt Lancaster added an interesting twist as Erik's friend/father. I loved Charles Dance as Erik and even though the lip syncing was pretty bad (all thanks to the flea scene with Carlotta) the singers who did sing were wonderful. Interesting thought though: was it just me or did Erik's voice sound different from when he was singing her to sleep and then when he was singing in his box with her?",1019347200,13,893,4.228070175438597

The scenes are enrapturing, the characterizations perfect, the singing expertly dubbed. The first time I saw this movie was with a friend; who, as a fellow Phantom Phan, told me that this was a must view. I sat down with an open mind, and not only laughed, cried, and gasped...but I was completely taken into this magnificent and so deliberately intricate plot.
Never have I sympathized with so many characters, understood them so much as I did for these. Charles Dance potrays a romantic, even sensual phantom, a very rare find in the horror movie retells of this old classic story. You never see the Phantom's face, but you don't need to. Many times as he's starting to take off the mask I thought there would be a glimpse...but there was always nothing. That is what makes a good movie. A movie where we can always wonder, and not be only dumbstruck at makeup and special effects.
The fact that this is filmed at the real Paris Opera House simply left me in awe. The few scenes where you see actual corridors and staircases from the monument give it a sense of reality...something no other Phantom movie has ever given me. This is perfect. Five stars. It would be so much more if possible. There is no flaw in this movie. It's simply a must.",1008979200,26,1364,4.504032258064516

On the other hand, Phantom of the Opera (TV Miniseries) presents,...reality, even if a tragic one, based on a story that could be real, or that maybe is real in the soul or heart or life of the person who transposed reality into fiction...Moreover, what makes this a delightful movie is the detailed attention that has been given to the creation of every plot, scene, replics, emotions,...attention that you almost feel it when you watch the movie,and even if this movie is a drama the final brings joy to the eyes and heart of the spectator, it feels him/her with hope that the sometimes ""harsh"" realities of life can be transcended (or at least amended) with love, because Love Endures All !",1008201600,7,1271,4.60352422907489

(other movies that DID vary, were done so poorly that it DID matter, if you know what I mean!)
The scene where he removes his mask for Christine........I felt my own heart in agony...........ohhhhhhhhhhh.........
This version gave me (if it's possible) even _more_ compassion for Erik than anything I've seen or read.  (the ALW Play excluded;)
I loved the fact that they never showed his unmasked face to the camera.  If someone was watching the show, expecting to see *the gory details* (to coin a phrase) they were missing the point!

It's somewhat a romantic movie for women-not the gore usually associated with the Phantom.  The second half is the best part.  Comments have been made about the brief fades but the movie was prepared for television and I was just grateful to have the dvd that I barely noticed.  Dance does a wonderful job as the phantom and I am sure I am not the only female to wish I were Christine.  I think the movie does a good job at letting the audience like both Eric and Phillipe.  We can see why she loves them both, but I think I would have chosen to stay with Eric in his enchanted realm.  And I think Dance has the most wonderful voice.  I just enjoyed hearing him talk.

Even though the singing is dubbed, it is done very well--with the exception of Carlotta, who just cannot stand that Christine is better than her.

Sure, this one took great liberties, just like the other movie versions.  However, I must admit I get so many guilty pleasures  out of the way this one is re-written.

I do not want to give away any spoilers, but I do believe that the Gerard Carriere (played by Burt Lancaster) has to be one of the strongest and most admirable ""spin-off"" PoTO characters I have ever seen (a term I use to refer to a new character introduced that was never in the original story).

I have the soundtrack to the Yeston & Kopit Musical, from which the script for this version is based.  I just love it too.  Lovely change of pace, and it captures the good, cuddly, playful side of my beloved Erik so well.  Charles Dance does such a good job at this role.

Anyone who loves the Yeston & Kopit Musical HAS to purchase this particular movie version, and anyone who likes this movie ought to see the Yeston & Kopit musical if and when it comes to town.
