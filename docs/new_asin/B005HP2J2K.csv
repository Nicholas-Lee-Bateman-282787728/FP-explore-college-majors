4702591,5,B005HP2J2K,"I began watching ""The Girls Next Door"" when it aired on E!, and I fell in love with the lighthearted exploits from the seemingly-down-to-earth, but not, cast of girls.

What makes this series so relatable is that it does blend a seemingly fantasy-filled life with that of reality because the girls are very real, and they appear genuine. While not many of us will ever get the opportunity to experience a day, let alone life at the playboy mansion, the series gave viewers an inside glimpse, and that creates a sense of empathy with Hefner and his girls.

The first four seasons are well-done. The fifth season, if you recognize the time-frame of events, is somewhat disappointing, as it seems as though it were put together with less care than the first few seasons. The sixth season introduces the new girls and attempts to provide an explanation for the shift from Holly, Bridget, and Kendra to Karissa, Kristina, and Crystal, but it isn't accurate. While that may be due to the fact that these are real people and not simply a cast of characters, the audience is left with many questions. Also, the sixth season was pretty bad television. The girls aren't believable. With Holly, Bridget, and Kendra, the audience knew that those girls had been living there for years before filming the show, so their affection for Hef was believable (whether truly accurate or not). The new girls are ""all of a sudden"" deeply in love with Hef? Relationships don't work that way, so there is a lack of trust between the audience and the new girls from the very beginning.

This is the kind of show you can cozy up on the couch for on a rainy day to watch multiple episodes, or the kind of show you can watch one episode at a time and be content. If you're at all interested in life at the Playboy mansion, buy this collection!",1324944000,22,1814,4.592592592592593

4702600,5,B005HP2J2K,I loved this show.  Even more interesting to watch after reading Holly Madison's book.,1440374400,3,86,5.142857142857143
4702601,5,B005HP2J2K,"I was, and still am a big fan of the Girls Next Door, and never considered it a guilty pleasure! Why would I? I am a young male, why wouldn't I like a show about hot chicks living in a mansion, traveling the world.

Like any great movie or show, it's not enough to have beautiful people and settings. You have to have diversity and chemistry with the characters which this show does.

The reason this show works is because of the vastly different personalities of Hef's girlfriends. Take a boy band for instance, there's the heartthrob, the serious one, the bad boy-there's a member for every teenage girl out there depending on what type of guy they're into. Well, the same dynamic is applied to this show. There's Holly, the more serious one and #1 girlfriend to Hef, there's Bridget, the bombshell, who in many ways is a real life walking talking Barbie doll, and there's Kendra, (mine and most and peoples' favorite) the energetic, edgy, hip hop chick. Ya see, there's a personality type for everyone watching.

I was a big fan of this show when it was on the air and was disappointed to see it slowly become scars, as E! rarely shows old reruns anymore as well as it being hard to find anywhere on streaming, so when I decided to look the show up on amazon I was pleasantly surprised to see that they have all of the seasons available individually or as a complete set both for a reasonable price (particularly the individual seasons.) I opted for collecting each season individually which I now have all except for the sixth which I'm still on the fence about purchasing as that is the season they switched the cast.

I think if you like this show you will love these DVD's as they are loaded with special features including many deleted scenes as well as audio commentary by the girls themselves which is my personal favorite feature as I get a kick out of how candid they are, even dropping a dime on when a scene is STAGED and not real. They're hilarious!

Whether you buy them individually or season by season, it is well worth the investment particularly if you were already a fan!",1437004800,2,2092,4.509234828496043

4702608,4,B005HP2J2K,"I bought this purely because I wanted to see theTransitions episodes and it left lots to be desired. I guess it was unrealistic to think I would get the real story in a realtiy TV series but I like the girls, and have always been interested in the behind the scenes of the Playboy mansion. You can pick up on some context clues, but if you are expecting to see the real story, or even genuine, non-PR controlled reactions, you will be disappointed. I was a fan of the original girls, but the new girls are not that horrible really, they are just more blonde cogs in a wheel. I am no hater, or prude, but you do start, or at least I did, especially in the last season, to see Heff as just gross. Maybe its the girls speaking awkwardly loudly for him to hear, or maybe its the forced conversation with Mary about how he has to begin again or perhaps its when he is making references to things his girlfriends grandparents wouldnt even remember. In my estimation, its when the bevy of new girls timelines and stores don't match that you feel dooped as a fan.
Technically, the first season is irritating because there is no ""play all"" and subsequent seasons make you select play episode or play episode with promo which is dumb, but later seasons you can select just play all. The box is nice, the DVDs are cute and the series is good, more for a look at how the other half live than anything truly groundbreaking, but its interesting to see the clutter, the staff, and the rules of living that lifestyle for me, and how being hot and blonde can, if you're smart and lucky, can parlay into opportunities for wealth and celebrity.",1399593600,,1625,4.401993355481728
4702629,5,B005HP2J2K,"I remember watching this on cable in 2006, and always wanted to get the complete series.  I finally pulled the trigger and i coulnt be happier with my purchase.  The final season is a bit of a let down though.",1390694400,,209,4.2

4702632,1,B005HP2J2K,"I went to GIRLS NEXT DOOR: The Complete Series.  I saw an offer for a used version described as VERY GOOD and purchased it.  When it arrived, it was all 6 seasons, NOT the complete set.  This was not stated.  I wanted it as a gift; the complete set looks nicer and takes up less space on a shelf.  Also, 1 of the seasons had 1 disc in a plastic holder, 2 discs floating free.  I contacted the seller.  She wrote back almost verbatim:  1. The discs were cleaned and tested to play well (I never mentioned this. I can't give this as a gift, so I don't know if they play) and 2. sorry about your lack of shelf space.  I've been ordering from Amazon, new and used, for over 6 years, this is only the 2nd time I've been dissatisfied and filed a claim.  Not too bad a track record but I've never had a purchase THIS DIFFERENT from the description of the item.  Plus, the contact didn't even address what I wrote.  I would not suggest purchasing from this seller until they understand Amazon's guides to selling.

PS I CAN'T POST AN UPDATE ON THE SELLERS (M&D's) RESPONSE TO MY BAD REVIEW, SO I'LL DO IT HERE.  SHE CLAIMS SHE ASKED ME TO RETURN THE DVD's AND I REFUSED.  FALSE.  APPARENTLY OUR EMAILS CROSSED IN THE MAIL.  I ASKED AMAZON WHAT TO DO WITH THE DVDS.  THEY SAID 1. I COULD KEEP THEM OR 2. I COULD RETURN THEM COD.  I'VE NEVER HAD TO DO THIS, NEVER BEEN UNSATISFIED WITH A PURCHASE BEFORE.  I EMAILED M&D's THAT AS SOON AS SHE TELLS ME HOW TO COD, THEY ARE IN THE MAIL.  AS LONG AS I DON'T HAVE TO PAY TO RETURN THEM, I WILL ... HAVEN'T WATCHED THEM, DON'T PLAN TO.",1380153600,5,1570,4.098684210526316

4702634,4,B005HP2J2K,"I LOVE this series (besides season 6, the new gals suck) but I wish there was a better menu... A ""play all"" option would be perfect! I was surprised it did not (when you are recovering from surgery, you notice these things and it matter! Lol) other than that, no complaints! Great light hearted fun.",1369353600,5,299,4.454545454545454
4702635,5,B005HP2J2K,"Absolutely love the Girls Next Door i had wanted it for ages then i finally came to terms with paying a lot for it but it's so worth it! I love everyone in it Hef, the girls and the staff ect... everything so family like and when you watch it it feels like your actually there with them which then you start to know everyone personally! I'm so glad they did this show because it shows a different side to what the mansion is perceived to be. They create so much excitement and memories and everything they do is always entertaining and funny.

(Boxing Spoiler)
The boxing it came in is amazing! It's a box with a lenticular picture on the front which it's just like the opening of each episode with the bobble heads and balloons which is very creative! It all so well protected each box has two half's and When you look at the DVD's side it had the chops of the playboy logo which merge into one with all 3 DVD cases. You get 17 disks like stated in the description. It's easily stored also each disk has a Picture of Holly, Bridget or Kendra and Series 6 Crystal, Karissa and Kristina. Special features on the actual DVD is brilliant so much to watch and it even includes a photo gallery.

I am a UK resident and even though it's a US format i couldn't help but buy it! I find it difficult to watch because the only thing it plays on is my laptop but i'm still not disappointed because i love it so much! It's just nice to sit in on a cold night watching The Girls Next Door! Very amazing and Good buy! :)",1359417600,8,1506,4.171821305841925
4702636,5,B005HP2J2K,This was a great buy.  It made more sense to get the whole series instead of buying the seasons one by one. The last season is not that good because it's the new girls but thr fist 4 seasons are great!  Love the girls!,1351728000,2,218,3.9318181818181817
4702637,3,B005HP2J2K,"I love the series and jumped when the price dropped on this. The quality is great and the packaging is really cute. My only issue is the last 4 discs don't work at all. None of my dvd players (regular, laptop and ps3) will read them =/ Really sucks and kind of pisses me off. Other than that though, it's a good buy.",1343865600,3,316,4.031746031746032

8473367,5,B005HP2J2K,"Huge fan of the show when it was airing on E! It's silly mindless fun to watch, and there are endless beautiful women and really fun places they go to and things that they try. I liked watching them from when the show first started to when it ended. You see them grow and change. With all of the drama unfolding around Holly's books and her feud with Kendra, I wanted to go back and watch them when they were getting along and making me laugh. And, my favorite gal is Bridget. I identify most with her and it was nice to watch how much she grew over the years on the show. Oh- and the commentary on most of it made me laugh quite a bit.",1492646400,,636,4.015748031496063

Her book made it seem like everything with the Girls Next Door was fake and that makes me sad. I still love this series and I'm glad I purchased the DVDs. I like that no body parts are censored.
