8644048,5,B00IOFDKLO,"Dog & Scissors is an anime series from 2013. Mainly about a young man named Kazuhito studying alone in Japan away from his parents with a huge obsession with books particularly the books of his favorite author. Until one day, he gets killed in a hit and run though ok, ok I have been informed by a commenter that this is actually not the right term but whatever 'a shoot and run' more like. I still like to think of it as a hit and run since it sounds way more neat said out loud but for reference there you have it. Still the perpetrator shoots the main character and runs for it while Kazuhito was only trying to save the life of a young woman that he sees writing.

This is not the end of the anime series! He returns reincarnated I suppose as a small dachshund dog. Surprisingly his favorite author can hear his dog speak and so begins a rather absurd tale. Read: More Absurd comedy

I really like the story from the very first episode when I first watched it online via someplace other than Crunchyroll. Before I knew about Crunchy that is.

One of the few anime which really grew attached to the voice actors when it came to the Subbed version. Also the first time heard Takahiro Sakurai's voice acting which thought was extremely pleasing.

Glad it was animated by Gonzo one of my favorite animation studios from other anime series. The animation for Dog & Scissors was so lush that consider this one of my favorite anime of 2013. Along with a huge list of other anime.",1415404800,2,1476,4.375912408759124

8644053,4,B00IOFDKLO,"Kazuhito is your average bookworm, loves books so much his room is stuffed to the brim with them.  His favorite author is the mysterious Shinobou Akiyama.  But one day he happens to be in a cafe with a lovely young lady when it is about to be robbed and the lady is threatened.  He gets in the way and is killed, but does not want to die as he has yet to read the last book of his authors Deadly Sins series - and get reincarnated in the body of a long haired dacshund.  Her fears he will go crazy until a familiar lady appears to adopt him, she is not only the one he saved - but she is his favorite author.  She has a very twisted personality and a very sharp pair of scissors that she is more than willing to use on him - but also she understands his thoughts.  Can this odd couple find common ground and learn to live together, or is Kazuhito doomed to be shaving practice to his new mistress, and can he survive long enough to read that final book?

Just finished this on crunchyroll and I have to admit it was an interesting series.  A lot of unusual characters reside in this one from the twisted editor, to the kid sister, to other authors that are in competition with Kirihime.  This is one you can not take seriously, but definately one you can watch again.",1401321600,11,1267,4.159836065573771
