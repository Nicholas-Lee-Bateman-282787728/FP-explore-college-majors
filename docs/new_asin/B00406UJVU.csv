There were so many times that myself and my husband said ""wow"" or ""oh my god that's amazing"".  I would strongly recommend this box set.  We also bought it for my father in law and he said it was the best present he had ever gotten.",1301097600,4,360,4.173913043478261

8412185,4,B00406UJVU,"I bought these dvds for my dad, but I've really enjoyed them too. Good production values, and I was lucky enough to get a great price.

FWIW, David Attenborough doesn't narrate all of these, and predictably enough, the ones he doesn't narrate are my least favorites",1468108800,,265,4.760869565217392
8412186,5,B00406UJVU,"This collection is one of the most amazing out there regarding biology. I am an evolutionary biology major and I feel that these videos are excellent sources of visual information, especially Life in Cold Blood. The information isn't so advanced that a layman would lose track of what is going on, but interesting tidbits of scientific information find their way into the narrative.",1465689600,,382,5.079365079365079

8412192,5,B00406UJVU,We owned life already but bought this set because of the excellent price.  I was thrilled when I got it and found out this version of life is narrated by attenborough and is also 102 minutes longer than the oprah winifrey version that we already own.  It's almost like owning two totally different versions!! My 7 year old has watched this series so many times she still loves it !! Life is a great family movie to watch over and over again.  It has a very good flow good sound quality and fabulous picture quality!! I would recomend to any one that loves nature and animals!,1393545600,4,575,4.40566037735849
8412193,5,B00406UJVU,I love BBC documentaries and this collection is absolutely fantastic.  There is so much to learn from these programs.  They can be watched again and again and still are amazing.
