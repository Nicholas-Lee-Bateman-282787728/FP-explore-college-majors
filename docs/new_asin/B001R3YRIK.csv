3773041,5,B001R3YRIK,"Kids up to about 8 yrs love this video.  I run a babysitting service in a tourist area, so I work for about 100 different families a year.  This show never fails to entertain!  The guys are really funny and the combo or problem solving with some short songs is a great mix.  I can even tolerate watching it multiple times!",1487116800,,322,4.229508196721311

3773048,5,B001R3YRIK,"If only I had known this show was going to be cancelled by Disney!!! I would have recorded every single episode they aired and kept them in my DVR permanently. Sadly, these are the only 4 episodes that have been put on DVD. Note to Disney: if you put the other episodes/entire seasons on DVD, I WILL BUY THEM ALL!!!!! We miss this show so much. Hands down one of the best kids' programs I've ever seen. My daughter loves this DVD, but 4 episodes isn't a whole lot. BRING BACK THE MOVERS!!!!!!!!",1447113600,5,494,4.32258064516129
3773049,5,B001R3YRIK,"I was so excited to find this DVD! Imagination Movers is one of my toddler's favorite shows, and sadly, it is no longer broadcast on television.

3773050,5,B001R3YRIK,"The Imagination Movers are the best show/band for kids, hands down. The show is silly and engaging and teaches kids about the importance of imagination and critical thinking. Plus, it's a kids show! That isn't a cartoon! With a bunch of real life dads! It's a shame that this isn't on Disney Junior anymore because it is great children's programming.

Also, if you haven't seen the Movers in concert, take your kids now. It's the best time your little one will have all year. Not only do they put on a great show, they fully engage the audience by coming out and giving high fives to the kids, etc. Even if you are in a big theater, they will even go up into the balcony to make sure every single kid has a good time. I would say they are the hardest working guys in children's entertainment.",1440460800,3,792,4.387755102040816

No matter what they are doing (or getting into) they stop and pay attention to the songs.  My girls are 8 months old now and for a couple months already this is the only show I really let them watch.  These 4 guys (and Nina, the girl on the show) are great at getting kids engaged in what they are doing.  Their movements, their speech, and especially their music just connects with my girls.  They love it.  As they get older I am sure they will get into the stories of the show as well but I know for 6-8 month old twin girls it is one of the only things that they actually stop what they are doing and pay attention to.",1402876800,,713,4.05

3773122,1,B001R3YRIK,"This show is not about imagining, it is about problem solving.
The concept of imagination here is limited to bright colors, gadgets, pop music, goofy antics and a mouse puppet. Actual imagination movers would demonstrate how to move the mind into different ""what if"" scenarios, not a fanciful approach to problem solving with trial and error.",1350777600,,342,5.125

3773124,4,B001R3YRIK,"and find CBeebies far superior, BUT..

I love these dudes, I find their mastery of different genres of music and catchy tunes extremely watchable. Far more likeable than The Wiggles who frankly, I find quite unsettling, and their songs are better than Hi-5, but of course they lack the cute babes of the latter ""beat-combo"". If the movers were to go on tour, I would hope that the supporting act would be those 2 blokes at the end of Jake and the Neverland Pirates who sing the amusing pirate songs, they are great as well!!",1347840000,,524,4.515789473684211

However, it ONLY has four episodes! I looove the movers, it is my favorite show of his, but I think I am going to go crazy if I have to watch one of these four episodes one more time. And he wants to watch it at least twice a day. I wish they had another video out. Also it was disappointing that the bonus episode wasn't a mover episode---it was Oso. Please Disney--make a decent dvd with more than just a few episodes! $20 for 4 episode just stinks.",1293321600,3,648,4.276422764227642

It's the only thing he'll sit still long enough to watch. When he hears the theme song, he comes running from where ever he is and immediately sits down. I'm pretty sure if I ever met these men face to face, I'd kiss them all.

The music is fresh and exciting, they don't talk down to the children, and the stories are adorable. I would buy it all over again.",1258675200,,529,4.038095238095238
3773183,5,B001R3YRIK,"As a parent of two speech-delayed boys (now age three), I cannot stress enough how wonderful this program is.  Our twins were diagnosed with undifferentiated speech delay - meaning there was no physical reason for them not to speak, they just didn't like talking.  In fact, they paid very little attention to speech.  Until they saw the movers, and began dancing from the moment the first notes hit the air.  Soon afterward, they began approximating words in the songs and are now able to sing a few lines here and there.  Obviously, there was more to it than just watching the Movers, but I believe the high-energy and engaging music helped these boys build a bridge from hearing music to using words.

The program is aimed at toddlers.  Each program revolves around a central problem, called an ""idea emergency.""  The movers then try several ideas to solve it.  The role modeling here is fantastic.  Not only does each member come up with an idea, but they are all treated respectfully and tried out and, if they don't work, they are encouraged to keep trying.  ""There's no bad ideas when you're brainstorming!"" are words every kid should learn to live by.

The show manages to teach kids important lessons without coming off as syrupy or preachy.  Even after hundreds of viewings (and even more exposure in the car via a Movers CD) my wife and I do not look for the Movers with dread.  Instead, we happily join in the singing and (sometimes) the dancing.

My very highest recommendation.",1257292800,4,1490,4.72093023255814
3773184,5,B001R3YRIK,"My two and a half year old loves this show and so do I. Although the show is silly and at times the ""idea emergencies"" seem a little ridiculous it still sends out a good message to the kids. They keep everything positive, upbeat and fun. For the people that have a negative opinion in regards to the actors or their motives I encourage you to go look at their website and read about the actors. Rich is a musician who can play several instruments. Scott is an award winning elementary school teacher. Dave is an architect who helped with the post Katrina rebuild. Smitty is a firefighter who assisted with search and rescue during Katrina. So these are real people not just a bunch of goofy guys trying to make a buck. The goal of their music and this show was to set a positive male influence in the lives of children and I think that is incredibly honorable.",1255910400,,860,4.38125
3773185,5,B001R3YRIK,"My son is 3 and he loves the movers.  This DVD features 4 episodes.  Our Comcast service recently took the movers off of ""On Demand"", so I really needed this DVD!  It always bugged me how Comcast defaulted to movie previews once a program finished.  Some of the movie previews they show in that box in the upper right corner are NOT appropriate for kids!  When an episode finishes on the DVD, it defaults to the menu and plays the theme song, so your kid will still be dancing when they ask u to play it again for them (each episode is about 30 minutes long).  The Imagination Movers sing songs that teach or have a good message, ""If u let me try, I can do it by myself!""  And the music is not annoying like the songs on so many other kid shows.  You'll catch yourself singing the songs long after your child watched it.  And to all the mommys out there, the movers are easy on the eyes!",1255219200,3,887,4.170588235294118

3773188,2,B001R3YRIK,"After watching 20 something episodes of this low brow and low budget show I've come to the conclusion that the Imagination Movers are slow half wits, possibly with ulterior motives.  I present to you the following evidence:

""Have a Ball"".  A young sports star has suffered a marked decline in his performance.  It takes the quartet 27 minutes to figure out that the athlete is having vision problems.  I figured it out the moment he picked up the Ketchup instead of the sports drink from the fridge.

""Bucket of Trouble"".  Rich gets his foot stuck in a bucket.  The episode focuses on removing said foot from bucket....

""Hiccups"".  Knit Knot's has the hiccups bringing his production facilities to a complete halt.  The methods the movers employ border on the ridiculous and in fact they do not cure his hiccups.  Knit Knot's solves his own problem.

""Super Goop"".  Dave glues Rich and Smitty together... The movers have not only created their own hazard, but given the properties of the ""Goop"", they have potentially unleashed a biological hazard.

""Sneeze and Thank You"".  Once again the movers are the problem.  This time Dave cannot stop sneezing.  Instead of pausing and actually thinking about what new product has been brought into the warehouse, the movers go through all kinds of zany antics before the realization that Scott is wearing something that Dave is allergic to.  I ask you dear reader, do you think it was the fabric, or perhaps fragments of un-smoked marijuana?

""All Broken Up"".  The movers break Nina's clock.  I thought they were supposed to SOLVE emergencies, not create them!

Let's ""E Hollywood True Story"" the Movers shall we? Ok:

Not much is known about Rich.  Sure he plays a variety of instruments which suggests that he's part of the underground indie scene.  Could there be more to him?  Tell me this, his ""Scribble Sticks"" that draw on the TV screen... are these an ingenious attempt at interacting with the audience, or a secret CIA plot at controlling the minds of our children through image manipulation...  The evidence is clear; he's a CIA plant gaining the trust of our youth.  I fear the day that he's activated and his sinister plan is put into motion.

Clearly Scott has consumed copious amounts of illegal narcotics.  I mean, he has long hair and a goatee.  Enough said, right?  For further evidence just consider that he is the mover with the least practical ideas.  He's the guy who's usually hanging around the refrigerator with a goofy grin on his face.  His bio states that he was inspired by Mr. Rogers of all people - and we all know from that internet forward that Mr. Rogers was a trained sniper with 1,000's of kills - just look it up on [...].

Dave was a former stand-up comic who is known for the red backwards hat he wears.  Not a rocket scientist by any means, but he clearly influences the group down divergent paths that rarely, if ever, lead to the correct solution to the problem at hand.  If you analyze the problems that the movers create themselves, Dave is usually the culprit.

Smitty is the keeper of records, and is often called upon as the research backbone for the group.  His journals contain all manner of incorrect solutions, but occasionally (usually after 20 plus minutes) he stumbles upon the solution.  Another curious fact about him is that he seems to have a connection with animals.  Perhaps this is part of Rich's plot... something akin to the CIA's Project Acoustic Kitty 30 - 40 years ago.

Be very wary of showing your children this brainwashing material.  The movers tend to make problems much worse before they get better... perhaps this is why our great nation lags behind other industrialized nations... it's an overarching conspiracy to dumb down our future generations...",1249689600,3,3766,4.790046656298601
3773189,5,B001R3YRIK,"My two boys absolutley love the Imagination Movers. It is a creative and fun show. Each episode has some problem (or idea emergency) that the Movers must think of a solution for. The guys are also musicians and the music is great. Most kids music drives me bonkers but the Imagination Movers call The Talking Heads, Red Hot Chilli Peppers and The Beastie Boys influences so their music is very smart and rhythmic. I completely recommend checking them out if you haven't already. If my husband and I can enjoy the music and episodes almost as much as our boys do, then just about anyone would enjoy the Imagination Movers.",1247270400,,621,4.654545454545454
3773220,5,B001R3YRIK,I bought this Imagination Movers DVD for my 3 yr old son for two reasons:- (a) he love them (b) to get him away from watching the same Mickey Mouse clubhouse cartoons. His favorite is the Bucket of trouble and we use the The Tooth Hurts episode to teach him that he needs to brush his teeth often to avoid visits to the dentist. Overall I think it's a great entertainment for the kids that contains some educational values in it as well.,1247270400,4,437,4.27710843373494
3773221,4,B001R3YRIK,"Several reviews indicated that the episodes listed on the package weren't on the DVD.  After looking in vain online for the listing, I Netflixed the DVD for my kids. (We already DVR all of their episodes - I wanted to see if there was any new material on this disc.)  Unfortunately, there isn't anything new. This is simply a collection of four Imagination Movers episodes, plus in true Disney fashion, a 20-minute ""sneak peek"" episode of the new ""Special Agent Oso"".

Don't get me wrong, I love the Movers. For those unfamiliar with the show, the Imagination Movers are four New Orleans children's musicians that have been around awhile, and were signed by Disney two years ago on a development deal.  Now they have their own 1/2 hour show on Disney Channel, with a few other recurring characters where they work in the ""Idea Warehouse"" and solve problems.  Each show features 2-3 original songs during the episode plus a ""Brainstorming"" song, book-ended by the opening theme and closing theme.

The name of the DVD, ""Warehouse Mouse Edition"", is an indication that the included episodes feature the recurring puppet character Warehouse Mouse.  Here are the episode details for this DVD (in order of appearance)

1. Episode 13: Bucket of Trouble - originally aired September 22nd, 2008
During the process of making a TV commercial, Mover Rich accidentally gets his foot stuck in a bucket. Songs include: ""I Can Do It By Myself"", ""Blowing Bubbles"",

2. Episode 2: The Tooth Hurts - originally aired September 7th, 2008
Warehouse Mouse has a toothache and needs to go to the vet. Songs include: ""No More Toothache"", ""Where is Warehouse Mouse?"", ""Where Am I Now?""

3. Episode 22: Who's Afraid of the Big, Bad Mouse? - aired January 31st, 2009
The Mover's TV breaks, and the repairman is afraid of Warehouse Mouse.  Songs include: ""We're Going to Fix It Up"", and ""Down on the Farm""

4. Episode 14: Finders Key-pers - aired September 27th, 2008
Neighbor Knit Knots is locked out of his office, and Warehouse Mouse must travel through the air ducts to get the keys.  Songs include: ""Idea Box"", ""Where Did My Keys Go?"", and ""Where Is Warehouse Mouse?"".

Hope this helps.  My kids and I are looking forward to the second season of the Movers, scheduled to start in September on Playhouse Disney.",1246406400,113,2288,4.8158567774936065
3773222,5,B001R3YRIK,Bought this for my 2 year old son because he LOVES the Imagination Movers (the singing and dancing have him hooked!). I like them because they are real dads that teach the kids to think and problem solve. There are 4 episodes of the Movers and a bonus Special Agent Oso episode. My son would watch this DVD over and over again if I let him!,1245974400,,340,4.166666666666667
3773223,1,B001R3YRIK,"Unfortunately after waiting weeks for the product to arrive (which was expected) upon opening the DVD, my young son watching, it doesn't work. He was upset, as was I. The DVD is region 1, made for US market, Australia is region 4.  As I have opened the product I don't believe I can return it. Please be careful when purchasing overseas.  I unfortunately will not use Amazon again for this reason.

The Imagination movers TV series are no longer aired on Disney or any other channel; and too bad, its really very hard to find the full episodes anywhere.. I wish I can buy full seasons or find them at least on Amazon videos. I was so glad to find this DVD with 4 episodes.. My both boys LOVE it and watch it very often.  The show is very interesting and educating (the movers brainstorm to solve a problem), and the songs are amazing. My 3 years old run around the house singing: Jump up.. Get down!! stand up..  turn around turn around.  I highly recommend this DVD and I ask for more Episodes on DVD.",1488326400,,736,4.169014084507042
