1405041,5,B000059HAJ,"Okay, so I'm 18, most say too old to enjoy Power Rangers but who cares!  Of course I'm only a die hard fan of the original first few seasons, up to space.  Well, turbo was disappointing but...anyway the movies are nice, though I'm annoyed w/ dbl sided discs like this.  Anyway the 1st movie is the best, totally kicks, and is what all power rangers is about.  The second was less satisfying, and while I don't really find Justin annoying or not, they could have done better.  So yeah, for power ranger fans this is great.  Now if they'd only release season box sets, I'd be in total morphanominal heaven!",1064966400,3,604,4.445454545454545
1405042,5,B000059HAJ,Power Rangers rule! This is a great DVD for my kids. I just hope they put all the Power Ranger movies on DVD.,1034380800,,109,3.782608695652174
1405043,5,B000059HAJ,You get two movies on one DVD.The storyline of the first movie differs from the series but other than that both are great for fans of the series.,1030233600,2,145,4.214285714285714
1405044,5,B000059HAJ,"The first movie everyone knows about who wathced the original and much better (had to say that) Power Rangers of the 90's. The first movie was cool and the story to get their new powers was really cool too but it's sort of a shame that the whole movie was a waste in a way. The movie didn't have anything to do with the show. What I mean is that if you were to watch this movie and then watched the show it wouldn't have mattered. Unlike the second movie which you HAD to see. After the first movie came out the television series HAD to have a different story for how the rangers got the Ninja powers. As everyone knows the TV show orignally came from Japan and all the clips in the show with the rangers fighting and the Zords were almost all from the Japan series. The movie on the other hand was made in America and wasn't a Japanese based film.
Some people don't understand why the movie version couldn't have been the way the rangers got the powers. Well that version is not the correct way they got them. The show's way was the true version and the movies way was just the USA's way of getting of getting money.
The second movie on the other hand had to be seen to understand the Turbo season and why Rocky wasn't the blue ranger anymore. The movie is good but it doesn't compare to the first but that is expected because the Turbo movie was set right into the plot of the show and not some other plot. The second movie uses the real command center, Zords, and weapons which is a let down b/c the first movies command center was awesome but once again this movie was based on the show totally. If you've never seen the second movie and are a fan of the orignial show then you'll like this movie for two former power rangers make an appearance in the movie.
The first movie had a cool new look, the second movie could've been shown one afternoon on Fox Kids when it first came out since it looked so much like the show. Well anyways I know it seems like I put both movies down but if you really like the original show you will really like these movies!",1010966400,3,2057,4.196969696969697
1405045,4,B000059HAJ,"Apologies to those who thought they had seen the back of the Power Rangers!
  This is quite an awesome lil package! The Power Rangers movie is great fun, with a groovy soundtrack that'll have you jumping round the room, kicking the cushions like you did when the programme was first out! Just relax and enjoy this fun and exciting romp!
  The Turbo movie, though not as good, is still worth a watch, and if it wasn't for that annoying boy Justin I'd love it even more! Plus, classic villains Zedd and Rita also make a brief appearance - they were the greatest Power Ranger villains!(Lord Zedd especially - excuse me for being a black sheep)
  So grab your Morphers, and feel the Power!!",1003363200,2,686,4.536585365853658
1405046,5,B000059HAJ,"I am looking foward to owning this. I have loved Power Rangers since it first came out and this special edition DVD is worth collecting. TO POWER RANGERS FANS: This is a msut collectable, as it shows the MMPR Movie which happened in another universe and the Turbo movie which hapens in the PR Universe as we all know. I hope this will attract PR fans and non-PR fans alike.

1405047,3,B000059HAJ,"Not too much to add to that...it is nice to have both movies on DVD, but the picture is pretty bad....I will be selling my copy...",985046400,,130,4.038461538461538
1405048,4,B000059HAJ,"First, yeah I would have liked to had both movies on seperate DVDs with more extras but this is better than nothing. MMPRTM--The video quality on mine was good but not as perfect as I remember the movie looking, just a tad grainy. I don't think any attempt to digitally remaster the video was made. Also, the actual print is different from the original one. The title card says only ""Power Rangers: The Movie"" and I think there is different music in the scene where Ivan gives out ooze, not sure on that one (there may be other changes but I didn't notice them). The overall sound, good good good. As for extras...they suck on this side of the disc. The trailer is not the real trailer, just a bunch of scenes Fox slapped together. The featurette is not the one that was before the Pagemaster video or the one that came on TV. It's spliced from both of those though. TAPRM--Everything is good here. Video, sound, etc. The extras are good. The featurette is the one that was available on Movieweb  and the trailer, well, I had never seen a theatrical trailer for this movie so it looks good. Overall, I'm happy to have the films on DVD and in widescreen. Extremely happy. Maybe we'll get special editions one day.",984700800,8,1212,4.484162895927602

1405084,5,B000059HAJ,"The classic show brought to the big screen. Turbo, however, shouldn't have been made. I guess that's why this isn't part of a trilogy.",1370563200,,134,4.625
1405085,5,B000059HAJ,"I am now 20, and being only 5 when the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers were on TV I still love the originals. If they could bring the first 4 seasons out on DVD I would totally buy them for my nephew to enjoy! These movies bring back old memories.",1212969600,,244,4.0
1405086,5,B000059HAJ,but as usual like in my other reviews on products..GO TO WAL-MART/TARGET FIRST!!! i found both movies on seperate dvd/cases for 5 bucks EACH! just burry ya little head in the $5.00 bin and search you will find them and well worth it! and no double sided disks!!,1113264000,3,261,4.458333333333333
1405087,1,B000059HAJ,i just wanted to say that although this is a good movie but not worth the price...i got it for 75% less somewhere else and i wouldnt pay this much here for it. it is a power ranger classic though so if you are into the power rangers this is a mmust have.,1105488000,6,254,3.811320754716981
1405088,5,B000059HAJ,I am a huge fan of the show i have seen almost all the episodes. I think they did a great job making both movies. That would be nice if they had mad a third movie from the pris (power rangers in space). Know since they show new episodes i still don't know how are they getting there powers since zordon was destroyed. He was the only one who created the pr.,1088208000,2,357,3.9722222222222223
7933366,5,B000059HAJ,if you're a Power Rangers fan then you definitely want this because the first movie is the Original Mighty Morphin' movie that takes place somewhere near the end of Season 2 & the beginning of Season 3 & then Turbo takes place right after Zeo ends & right before Turbo starts so you'll see how they got there Turbo Powers. I highly Recommend it for Power Rangers fans & for Super Hero fans,1516752000,,389,4.342465753424658

7933373,1,B000059HAJ,"Well I got this item fast. But I had problems playing it. It would jump around different places in the movie, going back and forth. The item was wrapped in plastic and had no scratches though. I was really disappointed that it didn't play as it should. And I was really looking forward to watching this movie, because I'm a fan of the show.:(",1465776000,,342,4.359375
7933374,5,B000059HAJ,"I've always had been, always will be a Power Rangers fan. I like how the Mighty Morphin' Rangers got their ninja powers in the movie better than the show (She's much more prettier than Ninjor any day.) and Ivan Ooze is a much better villain than Zedd and Rita but, I still can't place who that pig supposed to be. Turbo I love the movie but one thing I don't like about it is that they say ""Here's a brand new villain here have more ranger powers."" Didn't Zordon say in Wild West Rangers that adding more power to your existing ranger powers is risking? But, I'm one of the fans that like the fact that they gave a kid a ranger power but, if you asked me I say that Justin should've took Tommy place as Red Turbo Ranger NOT have someone inexperienced become the Red Turbo Ranger (in case you don't remember him his name was T.J.) in the second half of Power Rangers Turbo.",1440374400,,872,4.227544910179641
