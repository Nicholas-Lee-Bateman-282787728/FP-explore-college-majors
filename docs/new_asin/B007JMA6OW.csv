8518418,5,B007JMA6OW,"Pat O'Day is an excellent source to describe the excellent sounds of the NW bands, who were the inspiration for the more famous bands from Seattle: Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Sound Garden etc. It is a shame the local Seattle radio stations aren't dedicating at least an hour per day to the excellent musicians and their music from the late 50's & 60's. I've requested this several times to no avail, therefore, we are missing out on hearing the great NW Rock & Roll music which has basically 'sailed into the sunset.'",1364342400,,510,4.615384615384615
8518419,5,B007JMA6OW,I am a huge fan of the 60's NW music scene. This film is a welcome addition to my collection.,1359504000,,93,3.7
8518420,2,B007JMA6OW,"Wow I'm glad I only rented this - I'd be furious if I'd paid actual money for it!  Its like some computer-illiterate old guy was messing around on his new computer, fiddling with organizing old film clips and photos, and accidentally burned them to a DVD which somebody then mistakenly boxed up and sold.  The mish-mash of content is STRICTLY of interest to people born in the very early 1950s and earlier, who have fond memories of Seattle's early rock radio scene, but its going to be frustrating for them because it does such a poor job of covering this magical era.",1350864000,2,569,4.568627450980392
8518421,3,B007JMA6OW,"You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll see turtles in the sky!

Well, not really.  But, this video history of NorthWest Rock and Radio is a cool way to look back at a very magical time.

I especially like seeing legendary KISN/Portland DJ Tom Murphy talk about the Kingsmen.  Producer Jerry Dennon is all over this DVD too, so it's cool to hear his take on the 60s scene.  You'll find yourself wanting more, but this quick look is worth checking out!",1341187200,,444,4.5
8518422,4,B007JMA6OW,"I found this production to be an excellent depiction of the era and I was flushed with nostalgia, having been a part of a 'garage band' back then. Jerry Dennon was and is an integral part of the history of NW Rock N Roll and thus I was please to learn as much as I could about him.  For any one steeped in 60's-era rock and roll or any one now wanting to get a feel for what it was like back then when 'auto-tuning' and all other current technological tweaks weren't possible - this will interest you. Sweet stuff! :)",1337472000,,517,4.118811881188119
8518423,1,B007JMA6OW,"Curiosity won out and I bought this stinking thing.  I watched it and almost wretched.  It was ""of Jerry Dennon, by Jerry Dennon and for Jerry Dennon"".  Also, produced by, starring, featuring, created by, etc. Jerry Dennon.  It should have been called ""Jerry Dennon"" so people would know not to waste their hard earned money on this ""thing"".  The facts are distorted as is the quality of the production. As Norm says, ""buy a book"". As 60's Rocker says, ""save your money"". As I say, ""PHEW!""  Still trying to cash in after all these years...",1334102400,,539,4.621052631578947
8518424,1,B007JMA6OW,"I wish I would have been able to read a review before buying this DVD. It's not even watchable, mostly out of focus or fuzzy and less about the history than a tribute to the producer. Some of the copy was spoken at the speed of sound. I could have learned more about the subject in a cave. Save your money.",1333843200,,306,4.032786885245901
8518425,1,B007JMA6OW,"I am not sure which is worse.  The technically inferior production value (the DVD is barely watchable) or the slanted story of ""Louie Louie"" we get.  Sorry but Rockin' Robin and the Wailers recorded ""Louie Louie"" almost two years before the Kingsman even knew about the song.  In fact by 1961 just about every local Seattle band had ""Louie Louie"" in their repertoire.  Richard Berry's performance at the Eagle's Auditorium, downtown Seattle, in 1957, put the song into the underground music stream of the Northwest.

The rest of DVD is lots of fill material with worn out clips of early rock/pop NW bands and a not so subtle, sappy, tribute to Jerry Dennon.  Dennon is the star here and I bet the producer so it's thinly veiled vanity project.  I  have always liked Jerry and have much respect for him as a record man . . . but this is overboard. It's a shame that the same care that Jerry put into his records wasn't used in making of this video. Thankfully it only runs for 50 minutes.
