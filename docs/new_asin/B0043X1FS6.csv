8415460,3,B0043X1FS6,"The movie works the Esau/Jacob theme as twins struggle against each other. One wears a furry coat like Esau. They struggle in the womb to be the first born. The brothers create an army of hungry ""zombies"" to fight and kill each other. The setting is supposed to be Western North Carolina 1872, but that must have been added as the the dialouge would have you believe they are out west.

 A new preacher comes to town, who has strong sexual urges (males, females, horses). The sheriff had killed the old one, Harry Barry. The sheriff also keeps his step-son in jail. The twins create zombies by giving the people an elixir that makes them the living dead. Some zombies can run, others do a foot drag. Some can talk and reason, other are silent. If you note, there is a rebel flag behind the bar. There is also an America flag. Looks like it is the 50 star variety.

No nudity unless you count a fake rubber breast covered with blood.",1309737600,,932,4.406976744186046
8415461,1,B0043X1FS6,"""Fistful of Brains,"" the new horror project from Brain Damage Films, has only just made it out on DVD. With no little amount of excitement I ordered it. Stoked to watch it and then add it to my collection of nearly two-hundred zombie films, I went to my mail box daily in hopes it would be there. That's right, nearly two-hundred films in my collection. And while that may seem a bit excessive to some, it seems just about right to me, since I am a huge fan of the genre. That also means that when I write a review on the subject, I'm not messing around. ""Fistful of Brains"" arrived quickly, and I went directly to my DVD player with it. Now, it was bad right from the start, I'm sorry to say. Still, I decided to watch for a while and give it a chance. It didn't get any better, though. In fact, it ultimately proved one of the worst zombie films I've ever seen. Undoubtedly, conclusively one of the worst.

The acting is atrocious. Don't get me wrong, I'm all about B-movie, indie level acting; but this was as if they simply pulled in random people off the street and gave them lines. The parts that were supposed to be serious were humorous, and the parts that were supposed to be humorous were embarrassingly awful.

That brings us to the filming itself. Like I said before, I am all about B-movie, indie level acting, and that is also so of the filming look and techniques. In the case of ""Fistful of Brains,"" however, it looked as if they went out and purchased some beat-up camcorder from a pawn shop downtown and proceeded to film a horror movie with it. It's bad. Really bad. It makes the late '80s/early '90s Troma release ""Redneck Zombies"" look like a multi-million dollar Hollywood blockbuster of all things. Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of ""Redneck Zombies."" Just seemed like a good example to make my point.

In truth, the only thing this travesty of a zombie film had going for it was the plot, which was horribly done by them but would definitely have potential in another filmmaker's hands.

Don't buy this film unless you're a glutton for disappointment. Personally, I can't even in good conscience add it to my upwards of two-hundred zombie film collection.

A sad day in the zombie genre, indeed.",1293580800,,2219,4.469135802469136

8415463,4,B0043X1FS6,"I have watched this one several times now.  In this particular genre it is easy to just do yet another blood spattered gorefest.  The Director did phenomenally well on a short budget.  The special effects were as close to believable as you will ever see in a film like this.  There are a few places where continuity is a tad thin (look for the electrical box on the side of a building) but overall this film is worth watching several times, and is worthy of addition to your collection.",1289606400,5,486,4.426966292134831
