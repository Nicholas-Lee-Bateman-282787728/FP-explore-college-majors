8441262,5,B004U7EIMU,"Probably Bette Davis' best performance. A cliff hanger movie. If you have not seen this movie, you will never expect the ending. This was Davis' first movie after marrying Gary Merrill and ""all About Eve.""",1466899200,3,205,4.885714285714286
8441263,5,B004U7EIMU,Hard to find Bette Davis movie.  One of my favorites of hers.  This is one of those Amazon dvd's on demand and it was great.  No issues with it at all.,1411516800,,151,3.806451612903226
8441264,2,B004U7EIMU,"I love this movie and was very excited about obtaining a copy on DVD.
The excitement was short lived.  The quality of the copy is not the best.  It is very dark during various scenes.",1343001600,2,183,4.2
