3103127,5,B0013D8LNG,"I decided to watch this movie, not really knowing alot about the story. What drew me into it was the fact that actors such as Audra McDonald, Phylicia Rashad, and Sean Combs were in it. As soon as it started i couldn't leave the couch. The Story was amazing, and the acting by Audra Mcdonald and Phylicia Rashad was brilliant. Although Sean Combs did a good job, i thought his acting was shadowed by the womens, but still did a good job. The rest of the cast did a great job as well. I will definitley be getting this on DVD once it comes out.",1203984000,2,543,4.180952380952381
3103128,5,B0013D8LNG,I teach this every year as part of my curriculum.  I am so excited to have an updated version of the play to show my students.  They will really be able to relate to the updated actors.  I fell in love with the performances of all the chracters especially Ruth and Mama.  If only we had more role models like this in every house.  I can't wait to get the DVD and show my students!,1203984000,5,380,4.013333333333334
3103129,5,B0013D8LNG,"Normally I'm a channel surfer when I'm watching TV. Its nothing for me to be watching two or three shows at the same time. But last night my TV was glued to ABC. I didn't want to miss one second of what was going on. Many were critical of Diddy before the movie even hit the air but he did a phenomenal job. There were times that I wanted to smack him for being so mean spirited and so stupidly money hungry, but in the end I wanted to do as Phylicia Rashad, said and love him when he was at his lowest. Sanaa Lathan and Audra McDonald performed wonderfully as well. I cant wait until the DVD comes out to add it to my collection. I already have the other 2 editions.",1203984000,6,667,4.022556390977444
3103130,5,B0013D8LNG,"I awaited with great expectation for the ABC premier broadcast and all of my expectations where met.  Felicia Rashad performace was powerful, moving and inspiring.  Imagine what our communities would be today if we continue to have strong black women in our families who possess great wisdom, strength of character, fortitude and great discernment. Women who can allow a man to come into his own after failure. Women who are not self-serving, women who can instill virtues, values and honor our heritage.  Women with class and dignity who demand their respect.  What a role model.  The entire cast and crew are to be applauded.  I can't wait to by this DVD.

This production is one that should be packaged and taught in our schools system(s) and not just during Black History month.",1203984000,7,782,4.878787878787879
3103131,5,B0013D8LNG,"I saw this video on channel abc. I saw the original movie, broadway and several small stage plays with the original actors and substitute actors.  I don't believe Sean Combs performed slightly better than Sidney did.  He demostrated that he can act and should continue to act.  He made my husband feel what he was going through and this is no small task. He demostrated what every black man went through during this era and made you believe the depression, the anger, helplessness and finally freedom.
This was great and the video was great.",1203897600,4,541,4.73404255319149

3103142,3,B0013D8LNG,"This movie is entertaining to be sure, but it changed the meaning of some of the text by having Walter know about the baby without being told on stage. His snide we just make babies comment was never meant to be that. He didn't know about the baby when he said it on the play. Changing that & having Bennie not change her hair changes the play too much. As Bennie would say, this is the assimilationist version. I was very disappointed that they changed some of the message at the heart of this play.",1485734400,,500,4.273684210526316

This was shown on television a few years ago and I had been looking for it ever since.  The actors in this version are just as exciting, wonderful and emotional as my other favorite version with Danny Glover.

3103169,3,B0013D8LNG,"I would like to give this 3.5 stars if I could. I use this as a supplement teaching the play. Although the movie does largely follow the play and keeps much of the original dialogue, there are a few raising scenes and quite a few that are added in. These aren't distracting and add some interesting discussion points. The bigger issue is with the performances. McDonald and Rashad are fantastic. Combs, however....not so much. Walter Lee is and incredibly complex character and Combs' acting ability isn't really at a level to portray that complexity. Therefore, Combs' Walter is very one dimensional, to the point he becomes little more than annoying and spoiled. Th contrast between Combs and the other actors only makes the issue more evident. It makes for great character discussions, though.",1435881600,5,796,4.992481203007519

3103192,5,B0013D8LNG,WOW,1433289600,,3,3.0
3103193,4,B0013D8LNG,"I am a retired English teacher who has taught the play ""A Raisin in the Sun"" for many years to sophomores. We always followed up with one of the film versions of the play. I really liked the original 1961 version with Sidney Poitier, I guess, because Loraine Hansberrry also wrote the screenplay, and I felt this was true to her vision. For a few years we watched the 1989 American Playhouse version starring Danny Glover because it was in color and I thought it might be more realistic for the kids. However, the format of the film was as if we were watching one filmed on a theater stage - rather dry. So we went back to the old black and white version, as it seemed to have more life. When the 2008 TV film with Felicia Rachad came out I didn't see it, and just recently decided to order for my own video collection. Because it is made for TV, several of the scenes are shortened or left out entirely. For example, when Beneatha receives the African gown from Asagai and she dresses in it for her date with George, the scene with the drunken Walter and her dancing around the table is left out. Leaving out bits and pieces is why I rated it with four stars. With that being said, It is well-done, and well-acted, and certainly worth watching or owning.",1432857600,4,1255,4.3446808510638295
3103194,4,B0013D8LNG,"My students enjoyed this production of ""A Raisin in the Sun"".  The acting was good and at times excellent. The film stuck fairly close to the text which made it a good revision tool for the students while at the same time bringing the characters to life and enabling a better understanding of the nuances of the plot hitherto misinterpreted or misunderstood by them.  I would recommend it to all audiences, especially students studying the play.",1431561600,2,445,4.842105263157895

3103230,2,B0013D8LNG,"Last term my class read the play A Raisin In The Sun. They liked the play but needed the visual support of the DVD for better comprehension of the setting and the characters.  They wanted to see the updated version with Sean Combs (P Diddy).
I was really dissatisfied with his performance. His interpretation of Walter Lee was flat and seemingly forced. It reminded me of going to a high school play to watch the understudies.
I love and respect Mrs. Rashad, she is a great example of a strong matriarch.
Saani Lathan is great as the youthful, intelligent Beneatha!
  However, I just can't get the version with
Sidney Poitier out of my mind. His performance of Walter Lee Younger on his knees begging his mother to believe in his dreams brought tears to my eyes!
  The actress portraying his mother was so strong and emitted spirituality that you rarely see in films today. I'm sure Lansbury was proud of that performance.
So overall, our class loved reading the play but was disappointed in the new version.
  For a dream revealed, watch the version with Sidney Poitier.  Even it is in black and white, it is timeless and you will truly enjoy it!",1408924800,,1147,4.615763546798029

3103257,3,B0013D8LNG,"Sean Combs, though, is not an actor.  He lacks that special quality that Sydney Poitier had, and my students, 12th grade seniors in an urban public school, prefer Poitier's version to this.  Audra McDonald, however, is tremendous!  I love her!",1404000000,,243,5.025

I would highly recommend it.",1398470400,,107,4.4
3103259,2,B0013D8LNG,"I planned to use this in my classroom in conjunction with the Poirtier. Right from the start, Sean Combs, known as rapper P-Diddy, shows that he can't act. His line delivery is stiff. He portrays Walter Younger as a smarmy low-life. Additionally, the script is changed to make it more PC. Instead of Walter saying, "" I can't allow myself to be late for work,"" he says, ""I can't be being late for work."" Lines are added to try to make people like Travis's teacher look racists when there is no indication of that in the original play script. A very poor film indeed.",1397952000,2,565,4.4423076923076925
3103260,4,B0013D8LNG,"I watched this version first which had the best acting.  I then watched the original version and totally understood all the issues.  I think a person should watch the new and old version to truly understood the issues.  The play is about a family whose whole future depends upon the $10K life insurance policy the father left the family.  The father worked his whole life and the family all lived in a two room apartment the whole time.

The mother decides to use part of the money for the down payment on a house in a white neighborhood.  The song, a chauffer, wants the money to use for some scheme.  The mother, not wanting to kill her son's dreams, trusts him to deposit some of the money in the bank for the sister's education and the rest can be used by the son for his scheme.

The son decides to use all the money for the scheme.  A man runs off with the money.  The neighborhood's lawyer tries to talk the family into not moving into the neighborhood.  The mother and the daughter in law decide that they can all continue to work and come up with the money to pay the mortgage.

Sidney Poitier was more passionate and dynamic as the son than P.Diddy.
Beneatha is the original seems too old to be in college; Sanaa was a better Beneatha
The daughter and law was played equally well in both movies.
Phyllia Rashad was too classy and sadity to play the mother; the original mother was a better mother; she looked more like a woman that had struggled her whole life.",1397433600,,1471,4.367647058823529
3103261,5,B0013D8LNG,"My juniors read the play together and worked on reading, writing, and spelling activities during the read.  At the end they were ecstatic to see the play in action.  The culminating activity the students completed was a character analysis.  A fabulous purchase that brought everything together for my ESL students.",1394064000,,314,5.24
3103262,2,B0013D8LNG,"This version of A Raisin in The Sun was made for TV. While it is good that the high profile actors helped to introduce the play to a new generation of watchers, it is not as powerful as the play that was made for the theater. The best performance of this play was given by Esther Rolle and Danny Glover. It was filmed on stage and their performances are timeless (just like the powerful message of the play). Luckily, Amazon offers that version of the play.",1388275200,,457,4.325581395348837
3103263,2,B0013D8LNG,"I ordered this in conjunction with teaching my junior high English class Lorraine Hansberry's groundbreaking play ""A Raisin in the Sun."" I also showed the 1961 acclaimed film with Sidney Poitier. The earlier film (in black & white) is a masterpiece, only rarely diverging from Hansberry's script. When Poitier roars drunkenly as Walter Younger ""I'm a volcano!"" you believe him. When Sean Combs peevishly yells it, you don't. Combs is seriously miscast in this movie. He struts and glowers; you don't for a moment see in him the ruin of a middle-aged man's dreams, just a star who's trying to prove he can be a serious actor. The rest of the cast is good, but the script they are given, by Paris Qualles, is wooden, sentimental, and overly didactic. It's as if the screenwriter didn't trust Hansberry or his/her? audience to understand the subtext of the play--everything is spelled out, and flashback scenes and extra scenes are squeezed in to put everything in context, to explain what we might be missing. Why? The result is a Hallmark after-school special, rather than Hansberry's painful, aching masterpiece. Get the earlier version.",1374192000,2,1137,5.021164021164021

3103277,5,B0013D8LNG,"Is it blasphemy to suggest that this new version is better than the Sydney Poitier version? Then I commit blasphemy. The classic film is, of course, fantastic, but this new version, in the opinion of this English teacher, is better. The casting is terrific, and the small alterations made to the dialogue and plot -- and especially with regards to scene changes -- only serve to enhance the central message of the story.",1368662400,,420,4.767123287671233

3103284,3,B0013D8LNG,"Recently i read a review by Frank Rich in the New York magazine about a play in NYC called Clybourne Park. The article mentioned ""A raisin in the sun"", because the play is the basis for Clybourne Park, therefore, i was interested in seeing the movie.
The book was written in 1959 pre Civil Rights Act of 1964. I assume when Ms. Hansberry wrote the book, the Dream for blacks was that someday, racial equality would be accepted as a norm. How wrong they were and is provable today with a token black president who is rendered ineffective by the predominantly white southern Republican congress. Anything that the President proposes, gets knocked down by the republicans, whose goal from the very onset was to destroy his chances of being an effective president and get re elected.

The Youngers buy a house in a white neighborhood which was not too keen in having black neighbors. The association is willing to buy the house plus a premium. Walter had just lost most of the family's inheritance by a con man on a business venture. Walter NOT only lost his part but his sisters part, which was to pay for her Medical college. Everything that the Youngers had hoped for was destroyed.

Walter towards the end of the movie, ""sees the light"", rants about accepting the offer Lindner is willing to make, sell the house with additional monies offered by ""the property owners association"".
Now, the end is really close, my sister and I are rooting for Walter, he has become REAL, he is angry and he is clear headed. By selling the house there will be plenty of money left over, Everyone will be happy, no sense in trying to buy a house in a white neighborhood where you will be rejected anyway (in the real world).
But is that the way the movie ended? Hell no! Walter decides to stay in the house that his mother had put a down payment on, because of pride! Pride is great in certain circumstances, but not here, you have to be practical and use common sense. Sell the house! Otherwise, The neighbors WILL make your life unpleasant. That to me would have been a happy ending. No such thing as altering human nature. people are not happy unless they have someone to feel superior to. To answer Rodney Kings' ""can't we all get along?"" the answer is NO! this country will be forever divided. That's reality.
That is how i want the sequel to end.",1340582400,,2334,4.541567695961995

The acting is SUPERB throughout. Sean Combs gives a surprisingly believeable performance, while Phylicia Rashad SHINES in a role she was born to play. I now see why she was nominated for so many awards for this role. If you think you will think about Claire Huxtable, think again!  She is AMAZING.  This is a wonderful bittersweet story about money, greed, pride, and character that leaves you thinking about what is really important in life. Please understand, this is not a movie about black people, FOR black people.  This is a movie for anyone with a beating heart. It was riveting from start to finish.

3103301,5,B0013D8LNG,"I watched this movie last night and the effects it had on me are still lingering through this morning.  Not only is it a wonderful film production and acting performance of a classic and timeless story written for the stage by Lorraine Hansberry, but its also a much needed reminder of what it takes to keep our dreams alive while staying true to the moral and religious values that helped carry generations before us through tougher times.

My mother took us to see this play in NYC back in the 70's when I was about 10 year old.  I remember not understanding the different reactions of the grown-ups, I was more captivated by the experience of my first Broadway play and being inside a huge ornately decorated theatre. Watching the movie last night I now understand what all the sorrow, laughter, disappointment and triumph I saw on stage and throughout its audience of years past was all about. I now know why my mother was teary eyed afterwords.

This story is simply about the passing of the torch from one generation to the next.  The torch comes with all the emotions of the past (both good and bad) as well as its hopes and dreams. Any people who've been immigrants to or experienced oppression in a land will relate to this story.

I learned from watching this movie last night that what touched my mother so much in this story is that it represented her and my father's story, or any parent's story for that matter; for their children to attain all the dreams and hopes of their parents and generations past, dreams that have now become the children's dreams.  I also realized in watching that the obstacles and frustrations I've had to overcome are similar to those of my parents, maybe even inherited.

So Now it is I who carry the torch and will someday, with teary eyes of joy, pass all the hopes, dreams, sacrifices and struggles to my children when the time is ripe.

The message is clarified in this updated movie production. For if we don't pass on to the next generation our hopes and dreams along with the spiritual wisdom and moral guidance of past generations, all of it can simply ""dry up like a raisin in the sun, or fester like a sore and run.""

A Must Watch!

And for those reviewers who I feel are unjustly criticizing the acting of Sean Combs, try to remember, its not about the messenger as much as the message.  Don't be deferred, he delivers the message brilliantly. The question becomes, are you ready to receive it?",1239580800,,2448,4.55125284738041

The meaning behind the story is what really counts, and how each character portrayed their roles to bring the story to light was beyond good it was exceptional.  I remember seeing Ms Rashad on Oprah right before the movie aired and the scene where she finds out that her son gave the money away, was superb. Oprah asked her where did she go in that scene, and she said she went way back to slave women and their struggles, and i went right there with her.  Not many movies affect me emotionally, but that scene really got to me. that was acting at its finest!  it made me think about how hard my husband works to help keep our bills paid and to enjoy our life, but this womans husband worked hard to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads. he suddenly dies, and because of his hard work he was able to provide some security in case of his untimely deaf. his wife seizes an opportunity to become a homeowner and put her husbands hard work to good use, and her son blows it on a fluke.  that was painful!",1234656000,,1276,4.256198347107438

The acting is absoulutely fantastic.  It's rare when you see a movie like this nowadays, most movies released now are violent action superhero melodramas we've all seen before.  A Raisin In The Sun is drama based and character driven and the passion displayed in this film is emotionally charged.  You can tell the actors loved their characters, instead of just reading off a script.  I will say again how rare it is to find a recent film with exceptional writing and an interesting story.  I loved Philicia Rashad's performance.  She deserved the emmy.  I also loved P. Diddy (didn't know he could act too!).  He has practically mastered everything at this point.  (Check out his colgne ""Unforgivable"")!  A shameless plug.  I also loved Audra McDonald's performance.  She should have received an emmy too.

3103313,5,B0013D8LNG,"While I had been aware of the fact that a stage production revival had been underway, i didn't know that a new version of the movie had been made. Now, I am a serious fan of Sidney Poitier and know that his finest performance was in RITS, lets give credit here, Sidney Poitier is one of the greatest actors ever, and it is his own greatness that in RITS was his downfall. It is difficult to suspend disbelief and see Poitier as the downtrodden worker-for-the-man that RITS expects him to be. It's like trying to envision Tom Cruise as an every-man mechanic in the new War of the Worlds, you just can't stomach it. Enter Sean 'P-Diddy' Combs. Here we have a hip hop star whose credibility even as a music artist seemed bleak at best, let alone his trying out one of the toughest dramatic roles of all time. But to me, Sean does the job and then some. Here is the passionate man who just wants a break to be something better. He is convinced that he is made for greatness and thanks to Sean's portrayal, there is never room for doubt in my mind that this character has had it rough his whole life. The three women are absolutely amazing as has been said and the production itself with its' jittery camera work gives you a view of this family as though you were right there with them as a visitor in their house. This version of A Raisin in the Sun deserves a place in your collection next to your finest movies including the original version of this classic story. 5 stars+",1221350400,,1471,4.333333333333333
3103314,5,B0013D8LNG,"What happens when a film classic is revived? Sometimes it flops, but at other times it shines in a way not like the original but stands alone as a fine production. Such is what happens with Kenny Leon's revival of Lorraine Hansberry's ""A Raisin in the Sun,"" which is a new version for a new audience while still remaining faithful to the original play. Having just seen again the original 1961 movie I was all set to not like the 2008 film. Not to worry. Mr. Leon has every reason to be proud of his work here. The three women are exceptional. Phylicia Rashad as the matriarch of the Younger family brings a youthfulness to the character of a woman still very much engaged in life and seeping with quiet strenth. Audra McDonald becomes the charcter Ruth, and Sanaa Lathan as Beneatha literally shines as the young twenty-year-old so full of ambition and hope for a better life. While Sean Combs is no Sidney Poitier and is not always completely believable as Walter, he redeems himself in the climatic scene when he delivers his ""we just want to be good neighbors"" speech to John Stamos, the spokesman for the white neighborhood where the Younger family will be moving to shortly.

There are nice touches added to this film not in the original version, if you have to compare the two. There are more scenes outside of the cramped, claustrophobic apartment where much of the action takes place. Additionally the voice over of Morgan Freeman reading the Langston Hughes poem ""A Raisin in the Sun"" is beautiful.

Incuded with the DVD is a version of the film with running commentary by Mr. Leon as well as interviews with practically everyone connected with the film. Much is made by all of them that this is a classic, that it is all about living one's dreams, the ability to love, etc., etc., etc., all of which is true. But there is an elephant in the room that these folks are too kind to mention: that at the heart of this movie is the ugly word ""racism."" Unfortunately too many white people in this country still do not want a black family moving into their neighborhood.

""A Raisin in the Sun"" is in the same league as other American classics: ""A Streetcar Named Desire, ""Death of A Salesman"" and ""Long Day's Journey into Night."" It will be produced anew for each generation, whether on stage or in film. Mr. Leon's version certainly gets an A-.",1215561600,16,2349,4.574821852731591

He just doesn't have that powder keg ready to explode energy that Sidney Poitier brought to the role.  Also for teaching purposes, I would highly recommend showing the Sidney Poitier version.  It sticks much closer to the original play.  The new version has some unnecessary extra scenes that I assume were added just to get the film out of the apartment.",1214697600,13,641,4.578947368421052

I thought acting by ALL was very good and Sean Combs was very good in it; almost like he's an actor rather than music mogul.  Phylicia Rashad stole the movie - she played his mother and the scene where she finds out that her late husbands money has all gone, was amazing.  I've always known her to be a comic actress and yet this performance was superb.  John Stamos has a small role where he plays a nerdy (played well) white guy who is trying to deter the family from moving into a white neiborhood.
As the dvd cover says on the back - ""Dreams can make a life worth living, but they can also be dashed by bad decisions"".  This is mostly what the movie is about.  But how the family pull together to still give themselves a better life is the true lesson.
As I said, I cannot compare this version to anything else, but I really enjoyed it and thought it was done very well and acted well by everyone.  I hope that it will get some Emmy nods because I feel it's very deserving.  I loved it and hope you do as well.",1214092800,10,1273,4.056

My only disappointment is that some parts of the play have been left out, and new parts added.  This was due, likely, to an attempt to ""open up"" the play by showing locations outside of the Youngers' apartment where the entire stage play is set.  However, there is one change that bothered me--the part about Benetha's hair, which is often cited by scholars as a major symbol in the play, is completely left out of this production.

3103338,5,B0013D8LNG,"I really, really enjoyed this movie alot!! It is warm and will very much so keep your attention. The entire cast was great! Now Sean Combs. All the big names in Hollywood Sidney, Will, Glover, Rashad, Ice Cube and the list goes on. But if you can remember when these actors (to name a few) I just named off, they never just came on the big screen with a movie or two and just became Hollywood Blockbuster Stars right off the bat. They all had to start off small and over the years develope their own style of acting. Denzel is a great actor but he sure didn't walk on that red carpet right after his first, second or third movie either. He grinded for many years to get the name he has today. So I think Sean did very well for his first big role and in time I believe we will look back and say Sean Combs has come a long way since Monster's Ball and this movie too. Sean can't just jump into Will Smith, Tom Cruz etc... type movies. He is going to have to sell himself to Hollywood and us movie critics. So I wish people would stop dogging the man out and be patient and let him gather some growth and skill as he continues on his new journey in acting. I really don't care for his rapping much but I think he will do very well in acting. There is always going to be haters who don't wanna see people try new things. So they are quick just judge a person so fast with negative input. So I say, Sean Combs don't let people drag you down with negative weight. You do your thing and keep pushin' to the top!

This film, an adaptation of the Broadway production, is well worth watching.  Sean Combs, unfortunately, doesn't have the acting chops to carry the film as Sydney Poitier and Danny Glover do in earlier versions.  But the saving grace is that Combs's Walter Lee is passable.

3103341,2,B0013D8LNG,"I saw this when it aired on ABC in February, and I was really disappointed. This was the same cast that had revived this legendary play on Broadway a few years ago and it supposedly got good reviews.  However, I felt this television production was lacking a lot of things - namely the passion and intensity that was so prevalent in the classic 1961 film.  Something about this entire production felt a little ""off"" to me. It wasn't terrible, but I was left with the impression that the cast, good as it was, couldn't really connect to the roles they were playing and were basically sleepwalking through the entire movie.

I expected more from Phylicia Rashad, who is a wonderful actress, as matriarch Lena Younger - she was the main reason why I decided to tune in in the first place. But even she was lackluster, and that was a surprize, since the Lena role is one that is formidably powerful. Audra McDonald (Ruth) and Sanaa Lathan (Beneatha) are both exceptionally good actresses, but watching this, they were just okay. Also Beneatha's appearance in this production totally contradicts the person she claims to be (someone who says she isn't an ""assimilationist"" wouldn't wear her hair any other way but natural - but then, one could argue that Diana Sands didn't wear her hair natural in the 1961 version, either). Parts of the story where the emotion should have been explosive and moving just fizzled out or wasn't there at all: For example, the scene where Walter's friend tells him that their buddy took off with their money - Walter's reaction is so low key, it's almost as if he shugged it off. The same thing goes for when Walter has to break the news to his family. They show a little more trepidation than Walter does, but not by much.

Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, or whatever name he is calling himself this week, is no Sidney Poitier or Danny Glover (who reprised the role of Walter Lee Younger in a TV movie that aired in the late '80s). I'm sorry, but Combs cannot act. I know he tried, but his performance simply was not believable, period. No one can deny that he is a solid hit-maker in the field of music and an successful enterpreneur - I give him props for that - but he leaves a lot to be desired as an actor. Just because he's been cast in other films and spouts a few lines that Poitier did in the original Broadway play and the movie doesn't make him ""great"" or even an actor. However, that depends on what you think qualifies as such. Those who feel that way need to watch the 1961 film and then redefine the word ""great"" in their vocabulary.

Ultimately the blame for this lethargic production has to go to the director, who should have elicited more from his cast. I will say that the good thing about it was at least there was a modern cast with actors that most people of this generation have heard of. ""A Raisin In The Sun"" is a sensational play that will continue to resonate with audiences as the years go by, but it deserves to be performed with the passion that I'm sure Lorraine Hansberry would have wanted.",1207440000,8,3038,4.496376811594203
3103342,3,B0013D8LNG,"This recent ABC production was erratic; I'd like to see if the DVD restores several of the key passages that were cut out, including the memorable speech Beneatha gives to Asagai about what inspired her to become a doctor--in fact, the vital heart-to-heart Act III conversation between these two, which ought to run about 10 minutes, gets boiled down to 5 minutes!  (Compare this sequence with the one featured in the superb AMERICAN PLAYHOUSE dvd, in which Beneatha and Asagai have a heated debate about the power of one person to make a difference and the future of Africa, and you'll see that a great deal of social conscience, and relevance to our own post 9/11 world, was sacrificed).

Repeatedly, the edits that were made in what I saw in the broadcast were puzzling. The decision to have Mama visit her drunk son at The Green Hat is dubious; in the play, Hansberry characterizes Lena Younger as a Christian woman who despises liquor and the nightlife of the Southside. The decision to show the whole family visiting the dream house in Clybourne Park is a cop-out--in the play, Lena is the only one to have seen the property, which makes Walter's anger and feeling that his dream has been ""butchered"" palpable. The Murchison-Beneatha relationship gets short-changed as well--where's the tense 2nd date scene, in which she spurns his crude advances and sees him as a churlish, shallow fool? I also disagree with the producer's decision to have Travis remain in the room for many scenes--what made the original play great was the fact that Travis never gets to see his parents bicker, which is why he idolizes his father, who seems can do no wrong. Thus, some dramatic irony gets lost.

Then, there is the truly odd decision NOT to have Beneatha adopt a full Afro (did the producers fail to see why Hansberry chose this simple yet powerful symbol in her original production???)--this abridgement was inexcusable. Consequently, the ABC production makes Beneatha look like an ""assimilationist"", despite her protests.  What an absolute blow to the characterization of Beneatha, especially given how talented the actress here is.

The lead actors, with one notable exception, were quite good-- I was impressed with how Ruth and Asagai were developed, and I think Bill Nunn was superb in a minor and pivotal role as the naive Bobo.  It's a shame this production doesn't include the comical nosey neighbor, Mrs. Johnson, who refers matter-of-factly to a newspaper story about the violence African-Americans face for moving into the suburbs. Indeed, the imminent threat the Youngers face for making such a bold move is watered down in this ABC production.

Lastly, anyone familiar with Hansberry's play should see that Sean P-Diddy Combs really drops the ball in the crucial ""Pride"" speech--he looks and sounds anemic compared to the riveting performances previously given by Poitier and Glover. The catharsis of his reversal, his rejection of Lindner's buy-out, just wasn't there.

(As a side note, the broadcast ran for three hours, and yet the actual film was just a little over 2 hours--couldn't ABC done the right thing and avoided such a crude abridgement of the dialogue, especially in Act III, and the jarring commercial breaks?)

Would I show this production to my high school students?  Yes, but only in bits and pieces given the fact that the production deviates significantly from the original play. Students I've spoken to have expressed mixed reviews about this latest rpoduction.

Teachers, do the right thing and go with the AMERICAN PLAYHOUSE production instead, which is theatre at its finest and true to the spirit and intent of Hansberry's play.",1204070400,33,3662,5.006578947368421

There were times that I wanted to smack him for being so mean spirited and so stupidly money hungry, but in the end I wanted to do as Phylicia Rashad, said and love him when he was at his lowest. Sanaa Lathan and Audra McDonald performed wonderfully as well. I cant wait until the DVD comes out to add it to my collection. I already have the other 2 editions.",1203984000,6,667,4.022556390977444

Women who can allow a man to come into his own after failure. Women who are not self-serving, women who can instill virtues, values and honor our heritage.  Women with class and dignity who demand their respect.  What a role model.  The entire cast and crew are to be applauded.  I can't wait to by this DVD.

Although the movie does largely follow the play and keeps much of the original dialogue, there are a few raising scenes and quite a few that are added in. These aren't distracting and add some interesting discussion points. The bigger issue is with the performances. McDonald and Rashad are fantastic. Combs, however....not so much. Walter Lee is and incredibly complex character and Combs' acting ability isn't really at a level to portray that complexity. Therefore, Combs' Walter is very one dimensional, to the point he becomes little more than annoying and spoiled. Th contrast between Combs and the other actors only makes the issue more evident. It makes for great character discussions, though.",1435881600,5,796,4.992481203007519

3337690,4,B0013D8LNG,"I am a retired English teacher who has taught the play ""A Raisin in the Sun"" for many years to sophomores. We always followed up with one of the film versions of the play. I really liked the original 1961 version with Sidney Poitier, I guess, because Loraine Hansberrry also wrote the screenplay, and I felt this was true to her vision. For a few years we watched the 1989 American Playhouse version starring Danny Glover because it was in color and I thought it might be more realistic for the kids. However, the format of the film was as if we were watching one filmed on a theater stage - rather dry. So we went back to the old black and white version, as it seemed to have more life. When the 2008 TV film with Felicia Rachad came out I didn't see it, and just recently decided to order for my own video collection. Because it is made for TV, several of the scenes are shortened or left out entirely. For example, when Beneatha receives the African gown from Asagai and she dresses in it for her date with George, the scene with the drunken Walter and her dancing around the table is left out. Leaving out bits and pieces is why I rated it with four stars. With that being said, It is well-done, and well-acted, and certainly worth watching or owning.",1432857600,4,1255,4.3446808510638295

3337727,2,B0013D8LNG,"Last term my class read the play A Raisin In The Sun. They liked the play but needed the visual support of the DVD for better comprehension of the setting and the characters.  They wanted to see the updated version with Sean Combs (P Diddy).
I was really dissatisfied with his performance. His interpretation of Walter Lee was flat and seemingly forced. It reminded me of going to a high school play to watch the understudies.
I love and respect Mrs. Rashad, she is a great example of a strong matriarch.
Saani Lathan is great as the youthful, intelligent Beneatha!
  However, I just can't get the version with
Sidney Poitier out of my mind. His performance of Walter Lee Younger on his knees begging his mother to believe in his dreams brought tears to my eyes!
  The actress portraying his mother was so strong and emitted spirituality that you rarely see in films today. I'm sure Lansbury was proud of that performance.
So overall, our class loved reading the play but was disappointed in the new version.
  For a dream revealed, watch the version with Sidney Poitier.  Even it is in black and white, it is timeless and you will truly enjoy it!",1408924800,,1147,4.615763546798029

3337756,2,B0013D8LNG,"I planned to use this in my classroom in conjunction with the Poirtier. Right from the start, Sean Combs, known as rapper P-Diddy, shows that he can't act. His line delivery is stiff. He portrays Walter Younger as a smarmy low-life. Additionally, the script is changed to make it more PC. Instead of Walter saying, "" I can't allow myself to be late for work,"" he says, ""I can't be being late for work."" Lines are added to try to make people like Travis's teacher look racists when there is no indication of that in the original play script. A very poor film indeed.",1397952000,2,565,4.4423076923076925
3337757,4,B0013D8LNG,"I watched this version first which had the best acting.  I then watched the original version and totally understood all the issues.  I think a person should watch the new and old version to truly understood the issues.  The play is about a family whose whole future depends upon the $10K life insurance policy the father left the family.  The father worked his whole life and the family all lived in a two room apartment the whole time.

The mother decides to use part of the money for the down payment on a house in a white neighborhood.  The song, a chauffer, wants the money to use for some scheme.  The mother, not wanting to kill her son's dreams, trusts him to deposit some of the money in the bank for the sister's education and the rest can be used by the son for his scheme.

The son decides to use all the money for the scheme.  A man runs off with the money.  The neighborhood's lawyer tries to talk the family into not moving into the neighborhood.  The mother and the daughter in law decide that they can all continue to work and come up with the money to pay the mortgage.

Sidney Poitier was more passionate and dynamic as the son than P.Diddy.
Beneatha is the original seems too old to be in college; Sanaa was a better Beneatha
The daughter and law was played equally well in both movies.
Phyllia Rashad was too classy and sadity to play the mother; the original mother was a better mother; she looked more like a woman that had struggled her whole life.",1397433600,,1471,4.367647058823529

I also showed the 1961 acclaimed film with Sidney Poitier. The earlier film (in black & white) is a masterpiece, only rarely diverging from Hansberry's script. When Poitier roars drunkenly as Walter Younger ""I'm a volcano!"" you believe him. When Sean Combs peevishly yells it, you don't. Combs is seriously miscast in this movie. He struts and glowers; you don't for a moment see in him the ruin of a middle-aged man's dreams, just a star who's trying to prove he can be a serious actor. The rest of the cast is good, but the script they are given, by Paris Qualles, is wooden, sentimental, and overly didactic. It's as if the screenwriter didn't trust Hansberry or his/her? audience to understand the subtext of the play--everything is spelled out, and flashback scenes and extra scenes are squeezed in to put everything in context, to explain what we might be missing. Why? The result is a Hallmark after-school special, rather than Hansberry's painful, aching masterpiece. Get the earlier version.",1374192000,2,1137,5.021164021164021

3337781,3,B0013D8LNG,"Recently i read a review by Frank Rich in the New York magazine about a play in NYC called Clybourne Park. The article mentioned ""A raisin in the sun"", because the play is the basis for Clybourne Park, therefore, i was interested in seeing the movie.
The book was written in 1959 pre Civil Rights Act of 1964. I assume when Ms. Hansberry wrote the book, the Dream for blacks was that someday, racial equality would be accepted as a norm. How wrong they were and is provable today with a token black president who is rendered ineffective by the predominantly white southern Republican congress. Anything that the President proposes, gets knocked down by the republicans, whose goal from the very onset was to destroy his chances of being an effective president and get re elected.

The Youngers buy a house in a white neighborhood which was not too keen in having black neighbors. The association is willing to buy the house plus a premium. Walter had just lost most of the family's inheritance by a con man on a business venture. Walter NOT only lost his part but his sisters part, which was to pay for her Medical college. Everything that the Youngers had hoped for was destroyed.

Walter towards the end of the movie, ""sees the light"", rants about accepting the offer Lindner is willing to make, sell the house with additional monies offered by ""the property owners association"".
Now, the end is really close, my sister and I are rooting for Walter, he has become REAL, he is angry and he is clear headed. By selling the house there will be plenty of money left over, Everyone will be happy, no sense in trying to buy a house in a white neighborhood where you will be rejected anyway (in the real world).
But is that the way the movie ended? Hell no! Walter decides to stay in the house that his mother had put a down payment on, because of pride! Pride is great in certain circumstances, but not here, you have to be practical and use common sense. Sell the house! Otherwise, The neighbors WILL make your life unpleasant. That to me would have been a happy ending. No such thing as altering human nature. people are not happy unless they have someone to feel superior to. To answer Rodney Kings' ""can't we all get along?"" the answer is NO! this country will be forever divided. That's reality.

3337798,5,B0013D8LNG,"I watched this movie last night and the effects it had on me are still lingering through this morning.  Not only is it a wonderful film production and acting performance of a classic and timeless story written for the stage by Lorraine Hansberry, but its also a much needed reminder of what it takes to keep our dreams alive while staying true to the moral and religious values that helped carry generations before us through tougher times.

My mother took us to see this play in NYC back in the 70's when I was about 10 year old.  I remember not understanding the different reactions of the grown-ups, I was more captivated by the experience of my first Broadway play and being inside a huge ornately decorated theatre. Watching the movie last night I now understand what all the sorrow, laughter, disappointment and triumph I saw on stage and throughout its audience of years past was all about. I now know why my mother was teary eyed afterwords.

This story is simply about the passing of the torch from one generation to the next.  The torch comes with all the emotions of the past (both good and bad) as well as its hopes and dreams. Any people who've been immigrants to or experienced oppression in a land will relate to this story.

I learned from watching this movie last night that what touched my mother so much in this story is that it represented her and my father's story, or any parent's story for that matter; for their children to attain all the dreams and hopes of their parents and generations past, dreams that have now become the children's dreams.  I also realized in watching that the obstacles and frustrations I've had to overcome are similar to those of my parents, maybe even inherited.

So Now it is I who carry the torch and will someday, with teary eyes of joy, pass all the hopes, dreams, sacrifices and struggles to my children when the time is ripe.

The message is clarified in this updated movie production. For if we don't pass on to the next generation our hopes and dreams along with the spiritual wisdom and moral guidance of past generations, all of it can simply ""dry up like a raisin in the sun, or fester like a sore and run.""

A Must Watch!

And for those reviewers who I feel are unjustly criticizing the acting of Sean Combs, try to remember, its not about the messenger as much as the message.  Don't be deferred, he delivers the message brilliantly. The question becomes, are you ready to receive it?",1239580800,,2448,4.55125284738041

The meaning behind the story is what really counts, and how each character portrayed their roles to bring the story to light was beyond good it was exceptional.  I remember seeing Ms Rashad on Oprah right before the movie aired and the scene where she finds out that her son gave the money away, was superb. Oprah asked her where did she go in that scene, and she said she went way back to slave women and their struggles, and i went right there with her.  Not many movies affect me emotionally, but that scene really got to me. that was acting at its finest!  it made me think about how hard my husband works to help keep our bills paid and to enjoy our life, but this womans husband worked hard to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads. he suddenly dies, and because of his hard work he was able to provide some security in case of his untimely deaf. his wife seizes an opportunity to become a homeowner and put her husbands hard work to good use, and her son blows it on a fluke.  that was painful!",1234656000,,1276,4.256198347107438

The acting is absoulutely fantastic.  It's rare when you see a movie like this nowadays, most movies released now are violent action superhero melodramas we've all seen before.  A Raisin In The Sun is drama based and character driven and the passion displayed in this film is emotionally charged.  You can tell the actors loved their characters, instead of just reading off a script.  I will say again how rare it is to find a recent film with exceptional writing and an interesting story.  I loved Philicia Rashad's performance.  She deserved the emmy.  I also loved P. Diddy (didn't know he could act too!).  He has practically mastered everything at this point.  (Check out his colgne ""Unforgivable"")!  A shameless plug.  I also loved Audra McDonald's performance.  She should have received an emmy too.

Now, I am a serious fan of Sidney Poitier and know that his finest performance was in RITS, lets give credit here, Sidney Poitier is one of the greatest actors ever, and it is his own greatness that in RITS was his downfall. It is difficult to suspend disbelief and see Poitier as the downtrodden worker-for-the-man that RITS expects him to be. It's like trying to envision Tom Cruise as an every-man mechanic in the new War of the Worlds, you just can't stomach it. Enter Sean 'P-Diddy' Combs. Here we have a hip hop star whose credibility even as a music artist seemed bleak at best, let alone his trying out one of the toughest dramatic roles of all time. But to me, Sean does the job and then some. Here is the passionate man who just wants a break to be something better. He is convinced that he is made for greatness and thanks to Sean's portrayal, there is never room for doubt in my mind that this character has had it rough his whole life. The three women are absolutely amazing as has been said and the production itself with its' jittery camera work gives you a view of this family as though you were right there with them as a visitor in their house. This version of A Raisin in the Sun deserves a place in your collection next to your finest movies including the original version of this classic story. 5 stars+",1221350400,,1471,4.333333333333333
3337811,5,B0013D8LNG,"What happens when a film classic is revived? Sometimes it flops, but at other times it shines in a way not like the original but stands alone as a fine production. Such is what happens with Kenny Leon's revival of Lorraine Hansberry's ""A Raisin in the Sun,"" which is a new version for a new audience while still remaining faithful to the original play. Having just seen again the original 1961 movie I was all set to not like the 2008 film. Not to worry. Mr. Leon has every reason to be proud of his work here. The three women are exceptional. Phylicia Rashad as the matriarch of the Younger family brings a youthfulness to the character of a woman still very much engaged in life and seeping with quiet strenth. Audra McDonald becomes the charcter Ruth, and Sanaa Lathan as Beneatha literally shines as the young twenty-year-old so full of ambition and hope for a better life. While Sean Combs is no Sidney Poitier and is not always completely believable as Walter, he redeems himself in the climatic scene when he delivers his ""we just want to be good neighbors"" speech to John Stamos, the spokesman for the white neighborhood where the Younger family will be moving to shortly.

There are nice touches added to this film not in the original version, if you have to compare the two. There are more scenes outside of the cramped, claustrophobic apartment where much of the action takes place. Additionally the voice over of Morgan Freeman reading the Langston Hughes poem ""A Raisin in the Sun"" is beautiful.

Incuded with the DVD is a version of the film with running commentary by Mr. Leon as well as interviews with practically everyone connected with the film. Much is made by all of them that this is a classic, that it is all about living one's dreams, the ability to love, etc., etc., etc., all of which is true. But there is an elephant in the room that these folks are too kind to mention: that at the heart of this movie is the ugly word ""racism."" Unfortunately too many white people in this country still do not want a black family moving into their neighborhood.

""A Raisin in the Sun"" is in the same league as other American classics: ""A Streetcar Named Desire, ""Death of A Salesman"" and ""Long Day's Journey into Night."" It will be produced anew for each generation, whether on stage or in film. Mr. Leon's version certainly gets an A-.",1215561600,16,2349,4.574821852731591

He just doesn't have that powder keg ready to explode energy that Sidney Poitier brought to the role.  Also for teaching purposes, I would highly recommend showing the Sidney Poitier version.  It sticks much closer to the original play.  The new version has some unnecessary extra scenes that I assume were added just to get the film out of the apartment.",1214697600,13,641,4.578947368421052

I thought acting by ALL was very good and Sean Combs was very good in it; almost like he's an actor rather than music mogul.  Phylicia Rashad stole the movie - she played his mother and the scene where she finds out that her late husbands money has all gone, was amazing.  I've always known her to be a comic actress and yet this performance was superb.  John Stamos has a small role where he plays a nerdy (played well) white guy who is trying to deter the family from moving into a white neiborhood.
As the dvd cover says on the back - ""Dreams can make a life worth living, but they can also be dashed by bad decisions"".  This is mostly what the movie is about.  But how the family pull together to still give themselves a better life is the true lesson.
As I said, I cannot compare this version to anything else, but I really enjoyed it and thought it was done very well and acted well by everyone.  I hope that it will get some Emmy nods because I feel it's very deserving.  I loved it and hope you do as well.",1214092800,10,1273,4.056

This was due, likely, to an attempt to ""open up"" the play by showing locations outside of the Youngers' apartment where the entire stage play is set.  However, there is one change that bothered me--the part about Benetha's hair, which is often cited by scholars as a major symbol in the play, is completely left out of this production.

3337835,5,B0013D8LNG,"I really, really enjoyed this movie alot!! It is warm and will very much so keep your attention. The entire cast was great! Now Sean Combs. All the big names in Hollywood Sidney, Will, Glover, Rashad, Ice Cube and the list goes on. But if you can remember when these actors (to name a few) I just named off, they never just came on the big screen with a movie or two and just became Hollywood Blockbuster Stars right off the bat. They all had to start off small and over the years develope their own style of acting. Denzel is a great actor but he sure didn't walk on that red carpet right after his first, second or third movie either. He grinded for many years to get the name he has today. So I think Sean did very well for his first big role and in time I believe we will look back and say Sean Combs has come a long way since Monster's Ball and this movie too. Sean can't just jump into Will Smith, Tom Cruz etc... type movies. He is going to have to sell himself to Hollywood and us movie critics. So I wish people would stop dogging the man out and be patient and let him gather some growth and skill as he continues on his new journey in acting. I really don't care for his rapping much but I think he will do very well in acting. There is always going to be haters who don't wanna see people try new things. So they are quick just judge a person so fast with negative input. So I say, Sean Combs don't let people drag you down with negative weight. You do your thing and keep pushin' to the top!

This film, an adaptation of the Broadway production, is well worth watching.  Sean Combs, unfortunately, doesn't have the acting chops to carry the film as Sydney Poitier and Danny Glover do in earlier versions.  But the saving grace is that Combs's Walter Lee is passable.

3337838,2,B0013D8LNG,"I saw this when it aired on ABC in February, and I was really disappointed. This was the same cast that had revived this legendary play on Broadway a few years ago and it supposedly got good reviews.  However, I felt this television production was lacking a lot of things - namely the passion and intensity that was so prevalent in the classic 1961 film.  Something about this entire production felt a little ""off"" to me. It wasn't terrible, but I was left with the impression that the cast, good as it was, couldn't really connect to the roles they were playing and were basically sleepwalking through the entire movie.

I expected more from Phylicia Rashad, who is a wonderful actress, as matriarch Lena Younger - she was the main reason why I decided to tune in in the first place. But even she was lackluster, and that was a surprize, since the Lena role is one that is formidably powerful. Audra McDonald (Ruth) and Sanaa Lathan (Beneatha) are both exceptionally good actresses, but watching this, they were just okay. Also Beneatha's appearance in this production totally contradicts the person she claims to be (someone who says she isn't an ""assimilationist"" wouldn't wear her hair any other way but natural - but then, one could argue that Diana Sands didn't wear her hair natural in the 1961 version, either). Parts of the story where the emotion should have been explosive and moving just fizzled out or wasn't there at all: For example, the scene where Walter's friend tells him that their buddy took off with their money - Walter's reaction is so low key, it's almost as if he shugged it off. The same thing goes for when Walter has to break the news to his family. They show a little more trepidation than Walter does, but not by much.

Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, or whatever name he is calling himself this week, is no Sidney Poitier or Danny Glover (who reprised the role of Walter Lee Younger in a TV movie that aired in the late '80s). I'm sorry, but Combs cannot act. I know he tried, but his performance simply was not believable, period. No one can deny that he is a solid hit-maker in the field of music and an successful enterpreneur - I give him props for that - but he leaves a lot to be desired as an actor. Just because he's been cast in other films and spouts a few lines that Poitier did in the original Broadway play and the movie doesn't make him ""great"" or even an actor. However, that depends on what you think qualifies as such. Those who feel that way need to watch the 1961 film and then redefine the word ""great"" in their vocabulary.

Ultimately the blame for this lethargic production has to go to the director, who should have elicited more from his cast. I will say that the good thing about it was at least there was a modern cast with actors that most people of this generation have heard of. ""A Raisin In The Sun"" is a sensational play that will continue to resonate with audiences as the years go by, but it deserves to be performed with the passion that I'm sure Lorraine Hansberry would have wanted.",1207440000,8,3038,4.496376811594203
3337839,3,B0013D8LNG,"This recent ABC production was erratic; I'd like to see if the DVD restores several of the key passages that were cut out, including the memorable speech Beneatha gives to Asagai about what inspired her to become a doctor--in fact, the vital heart-to-heart Act III conversation between these two, which ought to run about 10 minutes, gets boiled down to 5 minutes!  (Compare this sequence with the one featured in the superb AMERICAN PLAYHOUSE dvd, in which Beneatha and Asagai have a heated debate about the power of one person to make a difference and the future of Africa, and you'll see that a great deal of social conscience, and relevance to our own post 9/11 world, was sacrificed).

Repeatedly, the edits that were made in what I saw in the broadcast were puzzling. The decision to have Mama visit her drunk son at The Green Hat is dubious; in the play, Hansberry characterizes Lena Younger as a Christian woman who despises liquor and the nightlife of the Southside. The decision to show the whole family visiting the dream house in Clybourne Park is a cop-out--in the play, Lena is the only one to have seen the property, which makes Walter's anger and feeling that his dream has been ""butchered"" palpable. The Murchison-Beneatha relationship gets short-changed as well--where's the tense 2nd date scene, in which she spurns his crude advances and sees him as a churlish, shallow fool? I also disagree with the producer's decision to have Travis remain in the room for many scenes--what made the original play great was the fact that Travis never gets to see his parents bicker, which is why he idolizes his father, who seems can do no wrong. Thus, some dramatic irony gets lost.

Then, there is the truly odd decision NOT to have Beneatha adopt a full Afro (did the producers fail to see why Hansberry chose this simple yet powerful symbol in her original production???)--this abridgement was inexcusable. Consequently, the ABC production makes Beneatha look like an ""assimilationist"", despite her protests.  What an absolute blow to the characterization of Beneatha, especially given how talented the actress here is.

The lead actors, with one notable exception, were quite good-- I was impressed with how Ruth and Asagai were developed, and I think Bill Nunn was superb in a minor and pivotal role as the naive Bobo.  It's a shame this production doesn't include the comical nosey neighbor, Mrs. Johnson, who refers matter-of-factly to a newspaper story about the violence African-Americans face for moving into the suburbs. Indeed, the imminent threat the Youngers face for making such a bold move is watered down in this ABC production.

Lastly, anyone familiar with Hansberry's play should see that Sean P-Diddy Combs really drops the ball in the crucial ""Pride"" speech--he looks and sounds anemic compared to the riveting performances previously given by Poitier and Glover. The catharsis of his reversal, his rejection of Lindner's buy-out, just wasn't there.

(As a side note, the broadcast ran for three hours, and yet the actual film was just a little over 2 hours--couldn't ABC done the right thing and avoided such a crude abridgement of the dialogue, especially in Act III, and the jarring commercial breaks?)

Would I show this production to my high school students?  Yes, but only in bits and pieces given the fact that the production deviates significantly from the original play. Students I've spoken to have expressed mixed reviews about this latest rpoduction.

Teachers, do the right thing and go with the AMERICAN PLAYHOUSE production instead, which is theatre at its finest and true to the spirit and intent of Hansberry's play.",1204070400,33,3662,5.006578947368421
