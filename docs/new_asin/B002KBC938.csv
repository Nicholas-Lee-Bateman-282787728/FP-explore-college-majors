8371833,5,B002KBC938,I saw this documentary on the History Channel and wanted it to share with our group that cruised Alaska last summer.  It's a great DVD about the entire history of Alaska.,1455494400,,170,4.483870967741935
8371834,5,B002KBC938,"Very informative. I was part of the pipeline crew depicted in the document. I was in it for about 2 seconds, so I might be partial. It brought back some good memories of my Alaskan adventure shared by thousands who worked on the pipeline. I bet a lot of old 798 pipeline union members would like this DVD.",1422576000,,305,4.275862068965517
