However he did so without noticing the playback restrictions!  Once this was discovered, we attempted to return the DVD for a refund, but rather than agree to refund our money, the sellers instead offered a work-around to allow us to play the video on a laptop with a DVD player.  In the end, our son was able to view his show and all was right with the world!",1485475200,,478,4.523255813953488

Thanks",1368489600,,125,4.681818181818182
