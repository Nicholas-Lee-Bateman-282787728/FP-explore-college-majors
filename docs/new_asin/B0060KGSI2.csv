8490455,5,B0060KGSI2,"Got it as a gift from another member of the Harmon family. I loved it! I thought it was terrific! Note, though, it is NOT biographical. The movie title makes use of Tom Harmon's famous name and his college, but that is a come-on. The film is entirely fictitious and begins with Tom Harmon as a new Michigan grad seeking to make it as a college coach. After taking some lumps and becoming ruthless about winning, he learns his lesson and regains his original high ideals. It is a compact movie, and a simple one, but well acted, and the plot flows nicely, but it is a 1941 B&W film, so don't expect a modern sports drama. As an interesting sidelight, it initially shows a few shots of the Michigan campus, but ends with Tom seeking to be a coach in California. When we see him, he is on the USC practice field with their gym in the background.",1453248000,,842,4.30188679245283
8490456,3,B0060KGSI2,If you are expecting a biography about Tom Harmon you will not get that here.  It is a fictional story although the beginning of the movie does show some footage of Harmon while playing at University of Michigan.  I enjoyed this film if for nothing else to see the old-style football play (and even such things as the loudspeakers at the football field back at that time - wow we've come a long way!).  View it as pure entertainment and you won't be disappointed.,1443312000,2,463,4.488095238095238
8490457,2,B0060KGSI2,"Harmon of Michigan is a great misnomer for this film.  Harmon, was an Indiana boy who attended the University of Michigan, but the U of M is nowhere to be found after the first five minutes of the movie.  The movie begins with a highlight reel of Harmon's career there and then receiving an award from a coach, ""Pop"" Branch, who Harmon claims to have idolized and learned character and fair play from.  The next hour of the film shows how little Harmon actually learned from this coach because he demonstrates none of those characteristics.  T.D. Harmon quits his assistant coaching job with ""Pop"" half way through the season to take a head coaching job with the archrival team Webster.  Harmon puts in a dangerous and illegal play with his new team and while using it to run up the score on ""Pop"" seriously injures his own quarterback.  This episode causes his wife to leave him.  But this is Hollywood, not real life and all's well that ends well as Tommy returns to assistant coaching under Pop and his wife comes back to him.

Of course, none of this is real life.  Harmon's claim in this 1941 movie was to aspire to coaching not professional ball, but the truth was that after being drafted in 1941 by the Bears, he opted to play in the rival American Football League.  WWII then interrupted his professional career and injuries he sustained to his legs during the war made his professional career with the Rams a brief one.  It was then that Harmon turned to broadcasting, not coaching.  And that college sweetheart wife in the movie was in real life, an actress that he'd met in Hollywood and married three years after this movie was made.  I've said in other reviews that people should not watch movies to learn their history, and this is the classic example.

All that said, if you enjoy watching some old football and can tolerate Tom Harmon as an actor, the movie can hold your interest because the rest of the cast is professional.  And this is no Ohio State sour grapes, my Minnesota team never lost to a Harmon Michigan team (7-6, 20-7, and 7-6 providing 3 of the 4 losses in Harmon's career).  I had to put that in because it's been 50 years since we've had a decent Big Ten football team in this state.

The movie itself probably would warrant a 3, but because it is all fiction and people seeing it 70+ years later will misinterpret it as fact, and the timeline of events is too unbelievable, I lowered it to a 2.  Bare bones DVD with merely the 65 minute movie.  Not worth spending a lot on this one.",1372809600,2,2518,4.470459518599562
8490458,5,B0060KGSI2,The DVD arrived well packaged and viewing it was a delight.  It was fun to see the real Tom Harmon in action and hear his voice.,1325030400,3,128,3.923076923076923
