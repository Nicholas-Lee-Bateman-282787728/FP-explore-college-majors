7913130,5,B00000JNTB,"Behind the Scenes is a wonderful series, with engaging and thoughtful presentations of the arts - I  wish that more were produced. Each video presents a key concept and depicts an artist employing it in their work. While the target audience is older, my 3 year old who loves making art, is a big fan. Thiebaud is  a great example for young artists, given his mastery of craft combined with simple yet appealing subject matter.",1142380800,,426,4.666666666666667
7913131,1,B00000JNTB,"although somewhat entertaining, this video by no means is a ""behind the scenes"" expose of mr. wayne thiebaud.  there is probably 6 to 8 minutes worth of video that shows thiebaud drawing.  the video is less than a half hour long.  there is a short enjoyable clip of matt groening drawing.  but this video is not worth $15.00.",1100995200,3,325,4.551724137931035
