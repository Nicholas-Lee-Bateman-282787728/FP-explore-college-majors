2689968,5,B000KGGIXM,"This movie is based on a serious anthropological study about mankind 80.000 years ago. Of course, we are talking about primitive humans, survivors at an aggressive environment, some of them with limited possibilities of oral language. At that time, fire was their protection against predators and other humans. But what calls our attention, besides the story itself, is the human heritage of the divine, and that was shown through the incipient and newborn intellectual and emotional capacity. Great movie, makes us think about our role to mankind.",1222992000,3,548,5.310344827586207
2689969,5,B000KGGIXM,"I absolutely love Planet of the Apes.  Keep in mind, this is nothing like the older film with Charlton Heston.  This film has great computer effects and the makeup is amazing.  I would recommend this movie combination to everyone.",1200268800,,230,4.846153846153846
2689970,5,B000KGGIXM,"how they came up with a Planet of the Apes/Quest for Fire combo is is unknown to me but it sure works.  Quest for Fire is my favorite movie of all time.  the movie is older, 1981, and contains no words or dialogue in any modern language.  this is not a hindrance to the film but just the opposite.  the use of facial and body expressions are acting gold in this film.  the story centers around a group of pre-historic cave men trying to find fire to replace the one extinguished during an attack on their tribe.  this is a spell binding movie that i am sure you will watch over and over again.  as soon as i saw this movie back in 82 i was hooked.  trust me buy the DVD you will love it.

Planet of the Apes is a updated version of the hit 70's movies and series. i remember one of my younger brothers actually having a planet of the apes ""fan club"" in our neighborhood.  of course with modern technology the apes are very realistic and all of the special effects are outstanding. the acting is very good and casting is bang on.  this is another one of my favorite pics.  definitely one to add to your DVD library",1170892800,8,1113,4.149532710280374

8156392,5,B000KGGIXM,These are some old classics and to see them on one DVD is even a better deal. I am sure u know the Ape story but many are not familiar with the fire saga. You can almost imagine how tuff it was to get a hot meal back then. Anyway enjoy.,1284768000,,236,3.6470588235294117
