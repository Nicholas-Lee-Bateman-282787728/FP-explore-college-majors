7836246,5,6302993164,The quality of the tape is good considering it's age. This film ranks up there with Herzog's Aguirre the Wrath of God. Kaspar moves at a slower pace than Aguirre but both are quite good.,1431561600,,186,4.3428571428571425
7836247,5,6302993164,"Based on true story. In inimitable Herzog style at his artistic best, Kaspar stands for a poet and dreamer. There's that poignant scene in which he's being verbally assailed by the professor of ""logic"" and Kaspar refutes him with common sense and utterly poetic counter-argument. The prof gets floored but they still harass and torment the poet.
Kaspar is a pantheist -his notion of apples being live beings, his attunement to the oniricos -so many profound moments, many deep layers in this brilliant film.",1140912000,4,507,5.0476190476190474
7836248,3,6302993164,"The Mystery of Kaspar Hauser (Werner Herzog, 1974)

The Mystery of Kaspar Hauser (also known as Every Man for Himself and God Against All) is called, on the back of the video box, one of the early examples of ""New German Expressionist"" cinema. I assume that the blurb writer was talking about the film's somewhat glacial pace, which focuses far more on long pan-shots of visuals than on the film's plot/character study. It is, to be sure, quite a beautiful film in that regard (even if New Yorker Films did the VHS either on cheap tape or from a degraded master), but it will quite likely leave the viewer wondering more about Kaspar Hauser than he did before he watched the film. It's an interesting introduction to the Hauser legend, but one wonders how the contemporary public took Herzog's latest offering; after all, Herzog was fresh off the success of the brilliant Aguirre: The Wrath of God at the time, a far more coherent film that still utilized the ""long, beautiful pan shots"" convention.

Kaspar Hauser showed up in Nuremberg in 1828. No one knew where he came from, though legend has it that he had no contact with human beings before his mysterious appearance. (This is most likely untrue; if Hauser was capable of developing language at such a late stage in his life, he must have had at least some human interaction previous; cf. Davenport's biopic Mockingbird Don't Sing and the studies cited therein.) One way or the other, though, he became a curiosity exhibited to and studied by the upperclass before being murdered in 1833. It could certainly be argued that Herzog's glossing over of the events of Hauser's life is an attempt to create the tale more from Hauser's point of view than the points of view of those surrounding him, but it does make for a somewhat choppy tale; very short shrift is given the reasons behind the assaults that eventually ended his life (it was posited that, in fact, Kaspar was of royal blood, and that his guardian in Nuremberg, who died just before Kaspar was murdered, had uncovered proof of the link), not to mention the process of Kaspar acquiring the social skills he did in his five years in society.

All that said, The Mystery of Kaspar Hauser is still, certainly, a film worth watching; Bruno S.' portrayal of Kaspar is wonderful, and those around him have the over-the-top buffoonish style of many of Herzog's more memorable characters. The camerawork, of course, is wonderful, and it's amazing how effective bad photographic techniques can be in the right hands (Kaspar's dream sequences consistently look as if they've been filmed by an amateur taking family films with an old 8mm camera whose spotlight won't go off). However, the Herzog neophyte will likely want to save this one for after having watched such films as Aguirre and the incomparable Fitzcarraldo. ***",1123632000,8,2829,4.816872427983539
7836249,5,6302993164,"This film is funny, intelligent, and gripping. It'll draw you in and keep your attention, then make you want to watch it again. Bruno S. as Kaspar Hauser is one of the most unforgettable characters I've ever seen in a movie, and believe me, I've seen a lot of movies. Oh yeah, a chicken gets hypnotized in this flick; even that alone makes it worth watching!",982886400,,358,4.4393939393939394
7836250,5,6302993164,"I first saw this film at a Werner Hertzog film festival held at the Academy Twin in Oxford Street, Paddington, in Sydney Australia sometime between 1975 to 1977 I guess, and its memory has been with me ever since.
Many years later it aired on SBS TV [Special Broadcasting Services - Ethnic TV] in Sydney with David Stratten as the presenter, but due to my poor TV reception at the time I didn't tape it! Along with 'Aguirre, the Wrath of God' and 'Fitzcarraldo' it is one of my all-time favourite films if not the number one.
I take my hat off to Hertzog for the great films he's put together over the years which, had the effect of keeping this boy 'sane'. I seem to recall David Stratten saying that Kaspar Hauser was originally released in Germany as 'Every Man for Himself, and God Against All'. This film should definitely be re-released on video and also transferred to DVD as soon as possible and made available to all who are interested in it. In fact this film is so good that it should be studied in schools around the world.
If it shows up on TV again, this time I'm ready... ariel correctly aligned!",973641600,9,1111,4.424390243902439
7836251,5,6302993164,"In all his ouvre, Herzog has rarely excelled more in sheer humanity of his vision as in The Mystery of Kaspar Hauser. There is little preoccupation with the gross and strange elements that form many of his later films. One can see a similar approach in Signs Of Life and The Land Of Silence And Darkness, and even later in Strozek (also with Bruno S.) but this is his masterpiece. The story of a foundling misunderstood by most and doomed to a tragic end rings true for all of us who care about others marginalized by society. The filmic style is straightforward with little pretense to flashy or overt techniques, but don't fool yourself - the visual style is quite calculated to reveal the inner truths flowing from the soul of Bruno S. This film is absolutely his finest hour (along with Aguirre) and has set the tone for his career to this day.",969753600,15,848,4.512987012987013
