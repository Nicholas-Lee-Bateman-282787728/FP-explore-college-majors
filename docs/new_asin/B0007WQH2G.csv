2246774,5,B0007WQH2G,"This is just a great show as the 1st and 2nd season. Maybe it's Johnny Depp best performance in this serie, he looks different but grown up. The story line is grown up too, these cops doesn't go undercover in schools as often as before, but they have to face bigger cases on the streets. You can also live their private lives more than before, and see them in personal situation with family, friends and love. The only disappointing thing is that the episodes'order is inexact, I noticed it in the last dvd: the 2-part-episode ""Loc'd out"" (wich they renamed on the dvd sleeve as ""Partners"" and I don't understand why) is supposed to be the last one of the 3rd season; but after that, you can see another episode, ""Next Victim"", put on the dvd as the last one. This is a fault, as I can clearly remember that this season ends up with Hanson in jail and Ioki in Hospital, but you can see everything going on as usual and Ioki working without problems. People who can't remember the exact order of the story could be confused by this. Anyway, you should have it!",1151539200,2,1059,4.408163265306122
2246775,5,B0007WQH2G,This is my favorite Johnny Depp role. I dunno why but ... he's really good in this show. And the other actors are great too. Great plots. I love it. I still watch it faithfully.,1126742400,,177,4.085714285714285
2246776,4,B0007WQH2G,"I adore both the first and second season of Jump Street, so obviously I couldn't wait until this one came to DVD. Unfortunately, I'm not quite as impressed with this season.

I found there to be some problems with the third season of 21 Jump Street. Here are just couple of them:

1) Johnny Depp intensely disliked the show, and desperately wanted out of his contract. He was tired of being labeled as a teenage ""heartthrob"", and so he didn't put as much effort into his acting. He even offered to do a season free if Fox would let him out of his contract. Because of his lack of enthusiasm, Depp isn't included in this season nearly as much. However, there are a few episodes in which Depp reportedly expressed interest in the script, so he actually attempted (and succeeded) to give a brilliant performance.

2) Although there are a few that are decent, most of the episodes are somewhat boring and cheesy. One example of this would be the episode called ""Woolly Bullies."" It's about Penhall and some bully troubles he's having, and the rest of the episode includes flashbacks of each of the Jump Street members' childhood bully experiences.  One good thing about this episode is the guest appearance by Peter DeLuise's father and brother. Another disappointing episode is ""What About Love?"" where Officer Hoffs discovers she's been sleeping with a married man. There is one scene where a sad song is playing while the screen is showing Judy walking around in slow motion looking sad...for a lengthy three minutes! It literally seems like they ran out of good material to use.

Despite these problems, there are a couple of extremely good episodes. ""Hell Week"" is an enjoyable episode about fraternities and hazing. One episode, in particular, is probably Johnny Depp's best performance of the entire show. It's called ""Swallowed Alive"". In this episode, Hanson and Penhall go undercover as inmates in a juvenile prison in order to find out how heroin is getting in the prison. After a bloody fight, Hanson becomes the ""Hammer"" (the guy in charge), while Penhall is shipped off to a psychiatric facility after being locked up in solitary confinement (because of his claustrophobia). Hanson is all alone, and he contemplates the fact that everyone he has busted in the past ends up in this prison, which he considers Hell. This episode is Depp's most emotional performance, and the story is intriguing and suspensful.

So, if it hadn't been for the couple of good episodes, I would have given this season 2 or 3 stars. It is still a marvelous show, and all the characters are thoroughly enjoyable, especially Penhall (who is hilarious, as usual) and Captain Fuller. If you enjoyed seasons 1 and 2, you will most likely find this one entertaining as well. I just found a few episodes to be a little uninspiring.",1126483200,13,2811,4.809523809523809
2246777,5,B0007WQH2G,"I have been waiting for season 3 of 21 Jump Street for a very long time - this is by far the best season in the entire series. I was surprised to see another reviewer belittle this season to nothing at all. I would like to present several counter-arguments why this is the best season and not the worst:

First, while Johnny Depp is the lead actor on 21 Jump Street and he usually finds himself most often in the best episodes, he does not necessarily carry the show entirely by himself. Jump Street also consists of 3 other important cops: Penhall, Hoffs, and Ioki, plus captain Fuller. Additionally, the 3rd season adds a 4th cop, Booker, and makes Sal the custodian a more recurring role. You can see throughout seasons 1, 2, and more importantly season 3, that all the characters are part of the show and it's not just about Johnny Depp. In 'The Blue Flu', each character has a very small role independent of the other as the city's police force goes on strike in a failed bargaining attempt. On the other hand, there are several episodes in which one character carries the entire episode. For example, in 'The Dragon And The Angel', Ioki is the star as he infiltrates a Vietnamese gang. In 'The Currency We Trade' Penhall takes the lead role as he arrests an innocent journalist and ruins his career - both excellent episodes that do not rely on Johnny Depp. However, there is one episode, 'Swallowed Alive', where the 4 guy cops on Jump Street go undercover in a juvenile prison/school facility. At first, Ioki and Booker (as the 'Samurai Twins') and Penhall and Hanson (as the famous 'McQuaid Brothers') are all part of the episode. Suddenly, in the middle of the episode, you find everyone gone except for Hanson (Johnny Depp) who puts on a solo performance in what I would call one of the best episodes in the entire series. So I do not agree that Depp hated the show and wanted out. If he did want off the show, he would not have been able to put out such a stellar performance in 'Swallowed Alive'.

Second, Booker arrives in season 3 as the 5th Jump Street cop. I wouldn't say he was a replacement for Hanson, as they have nothing in common. Booker is a totally off-the-hook character, much like a modern James Dean. Hanson, on the other hand is the handsome and polite guy who can become a rebel at times, but sticks to his soft-hearted personality more often than not. I think Booker was brought on to add diversity to the storyline and more importantly, to prepare for the spin-off show with the same title. Why else was he not featured in the opening credits?

Third, the writing for each episode is *NOT* downright terrible!  A new writer(s) took over the show in season 3 through the end of the series. While I was skeptical at first, I could hardly tell the difference in storyline quality. If anything, I would say that season 3 had more swearing and violence, but overall, more mature and intelligent themes. Just take the episode 'Hell Week' for example. This is probably my favorite episode in the series. Here we find the Jump Street investigating a rape in a prestigious college full of rich-boy frats. The entire segment featuring the actual ""hell week"" where initiations take place is so funny, intense, and exciting that I could watch it over and over a thousand times and still not be bored. The whole fork, spoon, knife test involving Ioki and Hanson is deserving of an award in my opinion.

One last comment on this season: 'High High' is another awesome episode that features all of the characters independently of one another. This time, we find Jump Street infiltrating a liberal arts school where everyone is unique, creative, and... into drugs! This episode feels more like a movie full of elaborate storylines and plot building throughout. It doesn't let go until the final credits roll.

With that said, I definately feel season 3 is one that isn't hurt by Depp's lesser role, but actually strenghtened by the overall excellent performance of all 7 characters.",1126483200,29,3998,4.639830508474576
2246778,2,B0007WQH2G,"When I heard that 21 Jump Street was coming out on DVD, I was relieved because I could finally discard all my old (poor quality from antenna stations) VHS tapes.  Well, I'm glad I kept them because I would rather watch a poor quality VHS tape when watch what is on these DVDs.  They changed the music folks!

I work for an independent record label in Chicago and Anchor Bay's version of Season 2 is not the original series because it does not contain the original music.  This series was visionary with its progressive musical credits. In fact, I credit this series for introducing me to acts from Terence Trent D'Arby ""Brother Hanson & the Miracle of Renner's Pond"" to Depeche Mode ""Out of Control"" (season 4?).

The reasons behind this bad decision can vary, I know. But I'm sure most of the blame is on part of the big record labels.  These dinosaurs need to realize that putting out their product can only increase sales and at the cost of Anchor Bay.  I will find very interesting to know increase of sales when the original episode aired, because I know I bought Terence Trent D'Arby the next day.

This is not ""THE COMPLETE SECOND SEAON"" because they removed one of the series major characters, the music.  If you are a lover of the original music, then I would pass on this purchase.

I rate it a 2 because I'm a huge fan of the series, but I will most like NOT buy season 4 and on if they changed the music.  Plus, I will always theses reviews before buying any original TV series.",1113696000,18,1490,4.401459854014599
2246779,5,B0007WQH2G,I was never a 21 Jump St fan until the introduction of Richard Grieco.  He is a wonderful actor and did a great job in Jump St and the spinoff Booker was great as well.  The introduction of his character and the movement to the later spinoff really helped the older teens watching Jump St move into a more adult show.  I have been waiting patiently for this 3rd season and can't wait until I can watch it at home.  I just hope that they will continue with the series and then even release dvds for Booker as well as there are some cross over episodes.,1110931200,10,551,4.169811320754717
2246780,5,B0007WQH2G,"Although series creator and executive Patrick Hasburgh was gone by this season, episodes throughout continued to hold viewer intrigue.

Richard Grieco joined 21 Jump Street as Dennis ""Booker"" Booker. Booker is initially challenged by Hansen in the episode ""Fun with animals"" at the start of this 20 episode season (1988-1989). Booker's racist attitudes have inevitably lead Hansen to deduct that this new colleague must have raped a black student. Booker was supposed to have been killed at the end of this same season, but was later spun off into a very short-lived show called ""Booker"".

Another serious episode is ""The currency we trade in"". A popular sportswriter is suspected of being a child molestor by his ex wife. Penhall's subsequent belief of those same allegations complicates that writer's public life.

In ""Whose choice is it anyway"" Judy ""Hoffs"" Hoffs goes undercover as a pregnant teen to expose the threats which were being made against a family planning center by anti-abortionists. Before there was a federal law against clinic violence, owners and staff actually were at the mercy of their local law enforcement's priorities. This episode perfectly encapsulates then-present reality without boring the intended target audience.

The Jump Street division gets another hefty dose of politics when they attempt to bust the mayor's son for drug dealing. In 'fathers and sons' City Hall responds by trying to control who these cops can legally bust. The Jump Street cops are doing the right thing unless their actions hit too close to home.

Home is a visible theme throughout this season. Officer Harry ""Ioki"" Ioki (played by real life immigrant Dustin Nguyen) is an 'American cop' but continues to wrestle with Vietnam. During ""The dragon and the angel"" he learns of a way to get his grandmother out of Vietnam. After Ioki is seriously wounded in a dramatic two-part season finale ""Loc'd out"", Hanson honestly becomes motivated to seek revenge for that incident.",1109635200,31,1979,5.171875

One episode was confusing at the end on how a person actually got shot episode""slippin into darkness"" i watched it twice and still cudnt figure out what happened exactly they screwd that episode up. Greico is in these episodes and he acts like he is supposed to a jerk off someone who needs to be beaten with a baseball bat. A little conditioning and his character wudnt have been so cynical. They could have left him out all together really he was only in maybe 8 shows then he leaves after season 4 doing 2 episodes thankgoodness. Season 3 is worth buying but not paying any more than maybe $15.00. I found a way to pay less like $8. Now all i need to watch is season five and will have to consider buying a region free dvd player just to watch the season that comes only on region 4 that is affordable.

2246796,4,B0007WQH2G,"This season I'd call the longer hair and waistline season. Not to poke fun but it seems that way. All the characters here get there share of screen time. The scope of the show has changed slightly, bigger and most of them don't take place in schools which is good direction to go. Speaking of direction Mario Van Peebles directs and stars in one of the stand out episodes. Also some of the supporting cast from the first 2 seasons come back as well. Some really great standout episodes here this season. Many people think that Depp called some of these episodes in but, as always he does a great job. Especially the finales of this season when he gets in trouble. Not much to say but I really enjoyed this season and season 2 which were the height of everyones career and acting ability.

2246808,2,B0007WQH2G,"I bought this set years ago, with the thought that I would watch it ""someday when I have time.""  Well, someday came a couple of weeks ago and I popped in disc 1, and wondered why they never addressed all the Jump Street cops coming back after their spring breakup and the cliffhanger that was left at the end of season 2.  Oh, well, I guess they just don't bring it up.  Watched disc 2, still enjoying.  Put in disc 3, and wondered how I managed to get mixed up and put disc 1 in again.  Hm, says disc 3 on it.  That's a problem, looked at disc 1 again, and realized that discs 3 and 4 were in the cover for both discs 1 and 2 and the cover for discs 3 and 4.  Now, it is well beyond any reasonable time frame that I would bother contacting amazon to replace this, as I said I bought it years ago, so I contacted the manufacturer, Anchor Bay.  Their only response was, sorry, we don't have the rights to this anymore, and no, we won't tell you who does so you can contact someone who can help you.

So in summation, the show (well, the episodes that I could watch anyway) were good, the reason for two stars instead of one.  On the other hand, the manufacturer, Anchor Bay, well, it wouldn't be polite to say what I think of them.

ps, even though Anchor Bay claims to no longer have the rights to this product, Anchor Bay Entertainment is still listed as the manufacturer on Amazon's website.",1271289600,,1393,4.16044776119403
