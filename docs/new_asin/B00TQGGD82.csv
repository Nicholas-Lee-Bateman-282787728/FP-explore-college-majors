7020377,5,B00TQGGD82,This is a great Japanese anime that depicts south American African culture with Michiko who is a Afro-Brazilian looking character and Hatchin (aka Hanna) who is a mix between Caucasian & Asian,1436832000,2,192,5.03125
7020378,5,B00TQGGD82,Love this series & the story the animation definitely recommend if you watch cowboy bebop sad it's only one season,1436659200,,114,4.75
7020379,5,B00TQGGD82,"im so glad there was a S.A.V.E. edition of this anime because I absolutely love it. It's a good twist in what I've seen in other animations, and as I watched it I felt as if I were ""as one"" with the characters. There's nothing else left to say but buy it.",1432684800,7,255,3.923076923076923

7020396,5,B00TQGGD82,"There hasn't been an anime I've watched that's stuck to me like this before. If you haven't given this show a watch, I highly recommend it. It's got an outstanding soundtrack, a compelling narrative to follow, and characters within that narrative that bring so much to it.

I could write a super long review for the show itself that'd be several paragraphs long but I'm saving that all for a video. What I do want to mostly dedicate this review to is the product itself.

This is a 4 disc Blu-Ray set consisting of all the discs from the Part 1 and 2 releases of the show that came out before. If you're wanting to buy the show all in one go, this is the best option, seeing as how it is around $25 as opposed to paying around $50 or so for two individual releases. So with that in mind, this has absolutely nothing special added onto it despite being a complete series set. You get every special feature the Part 1 and 2 releases had and nothing else, which is a shame. Though, considering that this is supposed to be a set made to be sold at a price that isn't too high, I can see why nothing new was added.

Still, the special features you get in the discs are pretty neat regardless. It was nice to get some perspective on the production from those who worked on both the sub and dub when there's such a scarce amount of info out about the show due its obscurity. It just would've been nice to get some more, but what I got is satisfying enough.

All in all, this is a solid release for an outstanding show that doesn't get enough love. If you're a fan wanting to own the show physically or even someone wanting to watch it for the first time, this set is worthy of a purchase.",1491696000,3,1681,4.211180124223603
7020397,5,B00TQGGD82,"Loved it, Love the entire series and such a deal to have all of it on blu-ray!",1486166400,,78,3.6470588235294117
7020398,4,B00TQGGD82,I'm really happy but I can't give it five stars. The reason why is because there was a crack that prevents one CD from being able to stay put but it's not too much of a problem.,1484956800,,177,3.810810810810811
7020399,5,B00TQGGD82,one of my favorite animes. great series at a great value :),1484697600,,59,4.0
7020400,2,B00TQGGD82,"The show is fine, that's not why I'm rating 2 stars. The product has an annoying ""SAVE! SUPER AWESOME VALUE EDITION!"" written down the side. Maybe I'm the only one but I hate having my merchandize plastered with pointless labels that cover part of the front. Even the spine of the box had it written so if I had it put on a shelf I wouldn't see ""Michiko and Hatchin"" I'd see ""SAVE!!!"" that's annoying",1484611200,2,400,4.346666666666667
7020401,5,B00TQGGD82,"I think this is the only anime series I've watched that isn't based off of a manga or light novel. That being said, I feel relief knowing that the anime DOES have an ending, instead of lasting for only 12-13 episodes without a definite conclusion. I've never watched it with the Japanese voice cast, but I can say the English dubbing is great! The dubbing helped me out a lot because Michiko & Hatchin was one of the first few animes I tried out while I was being introduced to anime. I'd like to recommend it to those who are beginning to gain interest in anime.",1483660800,,563,4.320754716981132
7020402,5,B00TQGGD82,"A great anime! I love great character development in anime, and this had it from start to finish; top that with great animation and this makes this a must have anime an any anime fans collection!",1483142400,,195,4.444444444444445
7020403,2,B00TQGGD82,"Apparently, there are no simply good people, just various types of bad. The cops are no more than a variety of gangster, and whether a priest, cook, or swindler, everyone is just out there doing their thing. Lies, cheats, violence, profanity, abuse, murder, all of it is mashed together with dreams and hopes. The story moves as the main characters basically snap, the woman busting out of prison, and the little girl from her foster family. The anime basically follows their search for the woman's man, who would be the girl's father. I didn't enjoy this anime. The art is certainly good, but the dialog, situations and characters aren't pleasant at all. I found the little girl's pursuit of goodness all the more awful against the pervasive rotten core of humanity. Not graphic, but certainly bleak. Not my thing.",1480377600,,815,4.870503597122302
7020404,4,B00TQGGD82,I saw one episode of this show on Adult Swim and liked it so I bought this S.A.V.E. version. I have seen the first 4 episodes so far and really enjoying it.,1472256000,,156,3.90625
7020405,5,B00TQGGD82,I don't really know what to say. Everything about this was good! This is a must watch.,1468972800,,86,4.117647058823529
7020406,3,B00TQGGD82,It's an alright show but it falls short after the first few episodes and really strays away from the fun that Cowboy Bebop creators should have delivered. The ending is also one of the worst I've ever seen and very unsatisfying. Hardly an ending. The only thing it had going for it was the hope it would pick up and it's great animation and style.,1465171200,,347,4.3538461538461535

7020408,5,B00TQGGD82,"This is such a wonderful story about chasing dreams, growing up and learning to deal with others.  I had read several reviews in magazines about this series I'm just glad that it's out in the SAVE edition what a great savings on the wallet.  I recommend this series to everyone and glad it's now in my personal collection.",1461974400,,322,4.5344827586206895
7020409,5,B00TQGGD82,"A great story about a girl and her ""mom"". Lots of action, great character development. Set in South America, drug dealers, gang violence, people doing whatever they can to get some money. And then there's the relationship built by the 2 main characters.

7020411,5,B00TQGGD82,"Despite the fact that our heroine is a scantily clad, semi literate escaped convict this anime is a very bold feminist statement. In a country eerily similar to Brazil (where all the street signs seem to be in Portugese) Michiko Milandro escapes from a maximum security prison to kidnap a girl whom she claims as her daughter whom she wishes to reunite with Hiroshi, her scoundrel of a father who abandoned her. While searching for the elusive Hiroshi Michiko must evade corrupt police, a determined criminal syndicate, various small time hoods, lascivious married men, a Chinese triad, the common cold, a determined police detective who was a childhood friend and most of all a miniature adult named Hana (Hat-chin) who proves to be the most formidable of all.  The Japanese cast is EXCELLENT as is the dub. It's a mother and child version of Thelma & Louise meet Crosby and Hope and definitely worth watching.",1455580800,,911,4.877419354838709

7020414,5,B00TQGGD82,All of the show data is located in one file (most DVD's have them separated by episode) and if you're converting it to video files for a personal home media server you will need to separate each episode manually - use the chapter indexes for easier splitting.

7020435,3,B00TQGGD82,"Though it's the same producer as Cowboy Bebop, the story was a bit too all over the place to be really compelling. The visuals are great. It's entertaining enough, but not anything spectacular.",1452384000,,193,4.878787878787879

7020437,5,B00TQGGD82,After watching on adult swim  I knew I had to buy the series and amazon had it for a great price. I would highly recommend mend this anime to anyone and if you want to own it amazon.com is the place to get it.,1446249600,,209,3.75
7020438,5,B00TQGGD82,Enjoyed the serie,1446076800,,17,5.0
7020439,5,B00TQGGD82,"Michiko & Hatchin is a 2008 anime series created and directed by Sayo Yamamoto (Lupin III: The Woman Called Fujiko Mine) and the now defunct Manglobe Studio. Shinichiro Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo) served as its producer. This is an amazing anime and brilliant directorial debut by Yamamoto.

Summary:
The show revolves around the ill-tempered and ill-mannered Michiko Malandro and the cunning and more respectful Hana or ""Hatchin"" as Michiko calls her. The series starts with Michiko breaking out of prison and forciblely rescuing (read kidnapping) presumed daughter Hatchin from her abusive foster family. After some arguing and fighting, the two take to the road across a fictitious South American country in search of Hiroshi Morenos; Michiko's lost and presumed dead lover and Hana's possible father.

The Show:
This is a great show, so I don't want to go into spoilers so I will use generals. The anime has a great cast of charactera both from the recurring pool and the one off pool. All the characters are varied and always entertaining from Atsuko, a proud police officer and former childhood friend of Michiko, to an unhinged sociopathic gangster, to an illusionist co-artist doctor, and so many more. Episodes themselves run the gambit; with some being zany adventures, others non-stop action, and others filled with real chilling drama. The first serious arc, the two part 'The Saudade of Fools', ends with a succession of really intense and emotional scenes made even more thrilling by the great acting and animation. And as intense as that episode was the series isn't all dour; there are many just as good funny moments as well. It's great!

Audio:
Japanese or English? Want to you understand? Because both are excellent. I've watched this series both in Japanese and English and it's phenomenal in both languages. Every voice actor fits their character and gives fantastic performances on top. This is an A+ sub and dub. Special mention to the actresses who play Hatchin (probably the most complex character in the show) in both languages as they truly capture her subtleties and all the facets of her being.

The music in the series is great. Being produced by Shinichiro Watanabe really shows with music playing a big part of the show. Brazilian musician Alexandre Kassin was brought in to compose the series and it gives it an authentic feel.

Visuals:
The visuals of the show look great with many different environments all beautiful realizing this fictional Brazilian world from densely packed cities to dirty ghettos to jungle villages to misty islands and more. And not just that, but the characters are just as varied and detailed. Many characters wear different outfits throughout, with Michiko changing her attire multiple times within some episodes. Another highlight are the facial animations. They convincingly display a wide array of emotions. The action scenes are great too; often being fast, fluid, and well choreographed.

Extras:
Funimation's Save pack includes a decent array of extra including: Episode commentaries for the first two and last two episodes, some Featurettes, and the obligatory previews.

Con?:
Nothing major. I would have liked some more extras, but for the price you get a nice set of extras. In the second half of the series there are some drops in animation quality, but nothing that's a deal breaker. It usually happens in the more humorous side bits.

Overview:
Honestly, I could praise this series all day and write something triple this length. I absolutely cannot recommend this series enough! With great production values, amazing characters, style that won't stop, and a nice price there is no reason not to try this phenomenal series.",1445385600,11,3712,5.12396694214876
