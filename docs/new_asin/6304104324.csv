792368,5,6304104324,"Beautiful and poetic, addresses human condition and speaks language of humanity sans all boundaries we have created for ourselves. Have to see it atelast once in life time.
Some of the memorable things are
how apu's mom is denied love the same way she denies the old woman
how apu dozes off when his mom was asking him if he would take care of him in future
the train scene
the rain, absolutely poetic
the old woman, cannot forget her face
how apu throws off the necklace into the pond
relationship between apu and sharila tagore
despite repeated blows of loosing loved ones, apu moves on
Cannot forget someof the scenes in the movie esp pather panchali (song of road), some of them kinda haunt me
esp Pather panchali ( song of the road ) was beautiful",1045267200,6,752,4.4963503649635035
792369,5,6304104324,"these movies are unquestionably the most important movies I have ever seen.  I have difficulty believing I will ever see another movie that even rivals these movies.  Absolutley stunningly beautiful, these movies destroyed me, and brought me deeper into touch with my own humanity.  The deceptively simple subject matter is the strength of these films, one would imagine a film about a boy growing up, losing family members, and eventually marrying and raising a child would be pretty boring, that's life one might say...  but Ray, and his cinematographer, bring such stunning beauty, and poigniancy to the story, there are no words in the English language to describe the loss that would be yours if you did not see these films at least once in your life....  And if you did not see the remastered versions, because the older versions are impossible to watch, because the picture quality is so bad, and the white subtitles blend in with the picture.  In these remastered versions, the picture quality is GREATLY restored, revealing the true beauty of the films imagery, and the subtitles have been done in yellow, clarifying all mysteries about the dialouge.",1039824000,11,1159,5.010416666666667
792370,5,6304104324,"All 3 movies in the trilogy are oustanding on their own. They all have the heart of humanity at the center and work around human relationships, whether it be sister-brother, mother-son or husband-wife.

792371,5,6304104324,"Pather Panchali(1952): From the opening titles in Bengali to the first scenes of young Durga stealing guavas from an orchard and skipping away this film transports one completely into the world of an Indian family living in the country.  When the young Apu is born and begins to grow he and his big sister Durga share all kinds of childish adventures. Durga and Apu are very entertaining and Ray captures childhood better than any other director. The adults are also well drawn. Stoic mother and dreaming want-to-be writer father living on the brink of poverty gives the film an attractive balance between adult and childs concerns. Made in the realist style in beautiful black and white , a mesemerising two hour film.
Aparjito(1956): This takes up right where the last one left off. The family moves to the city and there some of the most beautiful scenes are of the citizens and holy men going about their daily ablutions on the stone steps leading down to the Ganges. Apu growns up quickly(and the young actor is missed, replaced by an awkward adolescent with sprouting moustache)and this middle film follows Apu through his years at school in Calcutta. One of the best scenes is when the still young Apu is asked to read out loud in class and he does so in the most musical and poetic voice to the amazement of all his teachers and so eventually wins a scholarship. The first film all took place in the rural country. This one contrasts the industrial city and its sophisticated inhabitants and the rural countryside  and its simpler inhabitants and focuses on the growing division within Apu himself.
The World of Apu(1959): Apu is a young man(and the original actor who played the little boy returns to play him as a young man). Rays filmic style has also become more sophisticated. The highlight of this last of the three films is the bride Ananda. She is utterly beautiful and quite easily puts Apu's post-student dissarray into order. Their scenes together are some of the most memorable of the trilogy, they relate in such a naive/sophisticated way. The formality of the arranged marriage and opulent ceremony with traditonal costumes  contrasts markedly with the stark hovel where they begin their lives together and  underlines the state of India herself, caught between observing its traditons and finding a modern identity. This couple finds a perfect balance.
I have purposely avoided giving some key details which are better left unknown so that the element of surpsise will not be ruined while you experience the films for the first time. I watched all three films in a row and was left in a spell by them. These films show the very best use to which the cinema can be put. I'm very glad they did not dub the voices and used subtitles because the sound of Bengali being spoken is as alluring as the Ravi Shankar music.",1012608000,34,2836,4.7698574338085535
792372,5,6304104324,"The first movie was my favorite of the three, because I loved the boy apu.  I also loved his grandmother who was briliant, and there were some amazing scenes with her, including a particular sillhoutte scene that I recall (I  haven't seen the film in over a year).  The father is brilliant as well,  into the second movie, as is the sister. Throughout the trilogy, the music  that goes into the film is amazing.  These are technical masterpieces,  evident even to the amatuer film watcher like myself.  And you get a great  glimpse of mid-centruy Bengal and that culture from these films.",955324800,9,588,4.686274509803922
792373,5,6304104324,"This trilogy by Satyajit Ray may be cinema's greatest bildungsroman, or the development or upbringing story.  It is about the upbrininging of a boy, the eponymous Apu, beginning at early childhood to the stage of his  fatherhood.  Set against the backdrop of utter poverty in West Bengal,  it is almost the metaphoric journey of the human spirit struggling through  life's many stages of suffering, and finally triumphing in assuming its  responibilities.  The whole story is a rich tapestry of human  suffering, from bitter poverty to the loss of loved ones, including the  beloved one. And yet the trilogy isn't  a tragedy, since the human spirit  survives through these hardships, and does not lose its humanity or its  faith in itself.  Right at the end Apu regains his optimism in  humanity, in taking the responsibilty of his child, even though the birth  of this child resulted in the death of Apu's wife, that put him in a  profound despair, in which he wandered in the  wilderness for a number of  years.  It was a wilderness that was both physical, expressed in the  geography of Central India, as well as a spiritual one, of which the land  barrenness and ruggedness was a metaphor.  The trilogy has many facets:  from one angle, it is a realistic piece of documentary about poverty  (indeed in the Venice film festival it received a special jury price for  ""best human document"".  At another level it examines the  degrading effects of poverty upon human beings, which forces people to  resort to wrongdoing, e.g. theft (as in Apu's sister stealing a necklace),  or severs natural human bonds, (as when the grandmother is abandoned by  Apu's mother), loneliness and depression (Apu's mother in the second part),  and of course death.  You always feel that every death in that film was  caused by poverty in some way.  Indeed this trilogy is a pilgrimage  of the human soul through suffering, rather like King Lear is.  But whereas  Lear is about the human soul in its final stages of life, Apu encapsulates  all of human life, which is a pilgrimage, not just the last stages of life,  as in Lear.  Throughout the film, Apu's determination to learn,  educationally and spiritually, is the greatest source of the film provides.  Apu educates himself and throws away the shackles of ignorance and  superstition, and progresses.  One can interpret that one of the film's  messages may be that ignorance and supersttion are the causes of human  suffering, especially in the form of poverty.  The idea of progress gives  the film its mythic quality.  It is a more profound progress than a  material one.  It is spiritual and intellectual, which we all know ennobles  the human condition and does not corrupt it like weaslth does.  So one  senses from this particular type of progress in Apu a possible cure to all  the societal diseases of society, from poverty, crime and human cruelty.  We feel that if every one in society undergoes such a progress then society  as a whole might change for the better.  So by the end of the film the  human spirit does feel a sense of triumph.  Finally, despite the films  multifarious dimensions, we have to acknowledge that the film is actually  about an ordianry human beings, who interms of fame or success does not  achieve anything.  So its not a story of the ubermensch of myths or popular  culture, but rather a story about an ordinary person, just like us.  Indeed  a whole generation of calcuttans identified themselves with Apu.  And this  another supreme quality of the film, it triumphs the ordinary experiences  of Everyman, not crassly, but sees it in its multifarious qualities.  Indeed it dignifies the life of Man, even in the ignominy of dire poverty.  Satyajit Ray's humanism transpires more brilliantly in this trilogy  than any of his other works.  We can almost say that Apu himself may be a  perfect embodiment of that humanism that Ray harboured all his life, and  which is present in all his films.  This trilogy is the greatest  humanistic document that I have ever come across, the profundity of which  may even parallel the works of such other great artists as Shakespeare or  Tagore.",947894400,16,4156,4.832618025751073
792374,5,6304104324,"Any attempt to summarize these films is inevitably doomed to failure: how can one convey within a few words such poetry, such depth of feeling, such nobility of vision? To simplify, the major themes of these films are loss  and progress. By progress, Ray does not mean the acquisition of wealth and  power: this is nothing so crude as a rags-to-riches story. Ray's concept of  progress is something far more subtle and profound - a moral progress that  involves a willingness to engage with the complexities of life, painful  though it often is. The impression one is left with at the end is that of a  kind of glory - quite transcending the soul-destroying poverty against  which these films are set. I have seen nothing quite as moving as  this.
The emotional impact of these works seems to grow with each  repeated viewing. These are films to live with, and, taken together, seem  to me among this century's greatest artistic masterpieces, in any medium.",927244800,10,957,4.780487804878049

792481,5,6304104324,"Legendary cinematographer Satyajit Ray started his film direction career with this film ""Pather Panchali"" (A Song of the Little Road), which was made in Bengali language and released in 1955. It became internationally acclaimed classic cinema with no time. It was based on Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay's 1929 Bengali novel of the same title. Ray portrays a visual poetry while showing daily struggles in life of Apu in the backdrop of underdeveloped and poverty-ridden rural Bengal. The movie also became a successful endeavour due to portraying commonalities in daily struggles across the South Asian countries while keeping hopes and dreams for the betterment of lives and livelihoods with help of newly acquired western education. Apu represents the first generation bright young learners during the pre-independence British colonial era, having dreams in their eyes and thoughts.
Aparajito (The Unvanquished), released in 1956, was the second film in Apu trilogy and also second film directed by Satyajit Ray. Here Apu is growing up and overcoming all odds in life. This is a story of an adolescent boy to become an educated and independent young adult with sparkles in eyes.
Inclusion of the third film in Apu trilogy ""Apur Sansar"" (1959) makes this set complete. Here Apu is further growing up, overcoming all odds in life and suddenly got married. By the time he became an educated and independent (but unemployed for sometimes) young adult. Here, he faces another tragedy in life - losing his young wife. Apu became very sad and he lost interest in life. However, later he turns into life to take care of his son Kajal. Actor Soumitra Chatterjee played the role of main character Apu (Apurba Kumar Ray). This was the first film of Soumitra Chatterjee. Actress Sharmila Tagore played the role of character Aparna. This was the first film of Sharmila Tagore as well. Later both actors became very popular in Indian (Bengali and Hindi) films.",1410652800,3,1946,5.141955835962145

When I encountered Satajit I was also very involved in studying up on Akira Kurosawa and Stanley Kubrick. All of these directors have certain elements in common and of course their are many other directors that have certainly left their mark, that nevertheless you would find incredibly rare in today's cinema (Bergman comes to mind.) Satajit utilized some of the best available resources at his time and truly used the tools at his disposal to evocative understanding, of the human condition.

He was brilliant. I don't want to spoil the examination for you. In many ways his work transcends time and place; he was universal, and I sincerely want the entire world to know about him.",1367884800,2,806,4.970370370370371

792526,5,6304104324,"I saw the first film in the trilogy in my early twenties, and I've returned to the films again and again, never tiring of their truths and beauties. The story of how much Ray had to go through to finish the first film is a drama in itself--after mortgaging his house, exhausting his savings, the local government came to his rescue. His many fine films were never popular with large audiences and if you are not into masterpieces, or world cinema, this isn't for you. What makes this film so great? The story of a young Indian writer is taken through three stages--his childhood in a small village, his adolescence when the family moves to the city, and his adventures as a young writer independent from his family. It's the film's uncanny grip on humanity, the perfect casting, the moments of beauty and joy caught in ordinary life, and its visual integrity that make it so rare. Everyone has their own favorite images. Mine are the children discovering a train for the first time,the wedding party where the groom is discovered to be mad, the boy riding on his father's shoulders, the pages of the hero's novel showering down a hillside. Those images just touch the surface. In a recent showing to high school students, the third film, The World of Apu,left them in real tears--many were astounded that a film could leave them so moved. The films stand by themselves, but if you have the time, they are best seen in sequence. If you only have time with one, I would recommend The World of Apu because of its faster pace. The films move slowly, especially the first, Pather Pachali, so you'll need some patience.

I loved the movies, but it was too much to absorb all at once.

As it turns out, I keep returning to this trilogy faithfully every few years. I bought them separately and I sit in my Lazy Boy (not so hard on the rear) and watch all three over and over again. I am glad to see them released as a collection. They were not so easy to find one by one and before the advent of Amazon.com.

These films always have more to teach me about being a human being. The humor and the anguish and the despair are common to all of us. So is survival. I recommend the purchase of this trilogy because they should be viewed many times. There are so many nuances that you miss the first few times around.

7862828,5,6304104324,"These three films of 1920's Bengal played straight through on TCM last night.

Gorgeous high detail black and white cinema shows us life in rural India circa 1920's, based on the main character Apu.  First he is a beloved small son of a sad mother and highborn yet lazy and dreamy therefore poor father.

This everyday life of Apu and his sister playing and running around is the Classic India as I learned about it growing up in catholic schools in San francisco. We did hear a lot about India because our nuns had schools and convents there.  Indian was a land of mud huts and sacred cows and cow patties and flowing robes and barefoot children in hot dusty poverty.

And so it had been etched in our brains that we might try to help through donations, since their poverty was so extreme.  This is at first what a viewer of the West may think and see as he first gets absorbed in the young boyhood part, when his sister is still alive. The women wear their traditional garb which resemble Greek togas and the men wear the typical loose Indian short pants bunched up from behind and tied on in front.  The heat is obvious.  The mud walls and platforms where they live, the cooking done on the floor, the sleeping and sitting on the floor made of dirt, and the servility of the women are overwhelming impressions. The decrepit state of the thin and crooked grandmother who feels unwanted by Apu's mother, so much so that she ups and leaves when every step is painful, only to return when there is no where to go:  these scenes are almost painful to watch as it shows how mean and harsh we can be.

These films came out over the period of years from 1955 to 1959.  The style of Italiam Neorealism is clear, such as in The Bicycle Thief.  The lives of everyday and that means poor! Bengalis is the subject matte, while specifically it is the story of Apu, the small village boy who moves to Calcutta and then does extremely well in school, to dream of becoming a writer, yet finds the 1930's job market impossible.  He cannot quite resign himself to being a clerk at 45 rupees a month, in a cheap rooftop rented room, but by the most amazing trip to Khulna with a college friend, he is roped into marriage with a teenage girl whom he doesn't know but grows to love.

As other reviewers have written, it is slow and lyrical and full of the powerful melancholy music of RavinShankar, and the plot is important yet it is the emotions and feelings that are shown.

It was made on a very low budget and with mostly amateurs who had never acted before.  Street scenes and architecture and landscapes are immortalized through this film. Film critics worldwide consider it one of the greatest films of all times, taking all three as one story.

If you don't liek to see poverty and don't care about India, watch it anyway.  Have some patience and let the story seep into you.  You are in for a surprise.  All my old longings to visit India came back to me, the India I had dreamt of from school days. The Indian people are real and struggling as anywhere. Yet their intensity of emotion is the overwhelming feeling.  Listen to Apu's boss say what he wants in a wife:  someone smart with a bit of sauce and rebellion.  The. He laments that alas a he has an aquiescent and very dull woman who never argues!

Well that is what you will find in this film: not people inured to their fate but people with fire in them despite their grinding dusty poverty.",1448928000,,3440,4.398104265402844
