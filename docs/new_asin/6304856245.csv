935537,2,6304856245,"What's wrong with this movie? Hmm, where to begin... how about the fact that the main weapon of choice in the film is guns. That's right I said guns. Wong Fei Hung, Clubfoot and crew jump around performing martial arts and then shooting people dead. It makes no sense whatsoever and is totally out of character for Fei Hung who, in one scene, shoots a woman in the eye and kills her. Then there's the fact that the movie drags on and on with TERRIBLE comedy scenes that make you wish someone would shoot you in the eye and end the misery. The only thing saving this film from a one star rating is one AWESOME figth scene where Wong Fei Hung battles an ancient kung fu master in a massive treasure chamber.  Very cool but definely not worth the purchase price.",1019606400,,759,4.345070422535211
935538,5,6304856245,"movies number 4&5 bring a whole new element to the table and I love it. I read the [other] review posted here and it said that the series hit rock bottom with this one,[but] this movie is great,Chiu Man-Chuek is an excellent Wong Fei-Hung and with numbers 4&5 creates his own branch in the OUATIC series that are ""wire-Fu"" master pieces,while the first 2 movies were complete movie masterpieces,these ones are more like fantasy comic books and are totally off the wall,while Chiu isn't as much the star in this one as in #4,his students-Lueng Fun,Club Foot,and Butcher Wing create some amazing wire-fu spectacles in this one(especially Club-Foot) and has a very plentiful amount of well edidted fight scenes which will make you wish you weren't so sceptic of an OUATIC movie without Jet Li....  A great addition in the series,check it out,but remember to forget about Jet while watching this one and watch it for the great movie it is.",960854400,,935,4.807453416149069

7878501,2,6304856245,DVD quality is poor and the sound is not stereo. Very disappointed compare to the previous Once Upon a time in China movies. If you can find CD version the picture and the sound track is a lot better. Way over price for the quality of the movie.,1426723200,,245,4.125
7878502,4,6304856245,"I rate the movie itself 4 stars. I used to watch it on VHS when I was in school and liked it and the other OUATIC movies.

However like customer ""dck"" I too received a bootlegged copy that was shrink wrapped in a case as pictured but the disc itself had a Japanese movie called X-Cross. The disc had both X-Cross and OUATIC5 stamped on it. X-Cross is actually a pretty good film, but not what I had been expecting. I enjoyed X-Cross tremendously but still wanted to get this movie as well.

I ordered from a seller in NJ. It seems all copies sold on Amazon Market Place are shipped from NJ.

So I haven't got a chance to watch this on DVD yet.",1409097600,,643,4.128
7878503,1,6304856245,"I have been trying to get a copy of this DVD forever but there is always a problem. Yes I'm talking about PART 5.
Beware that there is a mistaken print run in the Bonzai released DVD. I have purchased 3 of them, all from different sellers. They were sealed but when I opened them up, instead of OUATIC 5, it was a Japanese horror movie called X-Cross. I've been through all options on the DVD and there is no OUATIC whatsoever. Even the DVD itself is stamped with ""Once upon a time in China 5"" But the disc artwork is for the Japanese flick X-Cross. Now I am going to have to watch the movie on VCD without subtitles.",1407196800,,617,4.15
7878504,5,6304856245,My son loved it!  I ordered it for him.  It was a Christmas gift.  He has a collection of it.,1359331200,,93,3.55
7878505,3,6304856245,"I have been looking for this movie ALL OVER and I have chinese friends looking at Chinese sites to find this movie, either cant find or its got no ENGLISH subtitles. When I found it here, I couldn't understand some of the reviews, probably cause all of you are looking for english dubbed translations. I however, am looking for CANTONESE W/ENGLISH SUBTITLES. Reason? All the good chinese movies came from Hong Kong pre-2000 and they are ALL CANTONESE. If u listen closely, you'll notice how bad dub jobs are. And when u watch it Cantonese w/ english subs, you get the original meaning of the script. Something gets lost in translation (i speak a lil canto so I kno) and the subtitles make up for that. The english track here is HORRIBLE! The people who released this movie to DVD would probably have save money and time just releasing it with english subtitles. To say the least, except for the language issue, the quality is good and of course the movie is AWESOME! Guns, kung fu and comedy! Needless to say, this will hold me in the meantime till I find the proper original version with english subs. If ur a fan of OUATIC, u won't be disappointed.",1341273600,,1150,4.533653846153846
7878506,2,6304856245,"I am a HUGE fan of the ""Once Upon a Time in China"" Hexology and became a fan when Sony Entertainment released the first three entries into the epic series in America on DVD and VHS. Doing research after completing what Sony called a 'trilogy', I was amazed to find that there were actually SIX entries into the series! After years of patiently waiting to see if OUATIC 4, 5 and 6 would get high quality American releases, I finally gave up and bought the DVDs released by BonZai Media Corporation (also known as Red Sun).

Fans of Asian cinema will no doubt be familiar with BonZai as they were one of the pioneering companies to release rare Asian cinema, such as Shaw Brothers, on English friendly DVDs. Fans will also know that BonZai is a rather shady company and the legitimacy of their releases is frequently brought into question. Still all their releases are silver pressed discs so all looks good at first glace but the quality of their transfers varies greatly from release to release.

The anamorphic widescreen transfer of their DVD release of ""Once Upon a Time in China V"" for the most part looks great. There however are two problems. The first problem is that there is a glitch on the DVD about 26 minutes into the film where the film freezes for a few seconds and then skips forward a second. It's a short glitch and both my DVD players and and blu-ray player was able to get through it but the major problem lies if you try to watch it in a computer. In both my desktop and my laptop, the film froze at that point and ended up having to close down the playing program. I went through three copies of the film and each has the same problem so this glitch is widespread.

The second problem is the English language track is absolutely horrendous. It is so muffled and staticy that I literally couldn't tell what many of the characters were saying at certain points. The Cantonese track however is flawless and sounds great so one could just listen to that track with English subtitles right? WRONG! There are no English subtitles on the disc so the Cantonese track is moot. I understand the English track probably hasn't been stored in the best conditions over the years but at least include English subtitles for the Cantonese track.

Bonzai's ""Once Upon a Time in China IV"" disc was acceptable and their release of ""Once Upon a Time in China 6"" was good but overall this is a rather shoddy release of the the more obscure fifth entry. The glitch makes the film impossible to watch on computers and unless you speak Cantonese then you are stuck listening to the awful quality English track. Still this is the ONLY way to see this film on English friendly DVD discs so us fans are stuck with it for now.",1335484800,2,2718,4.495951417004049
7878507,5,6304856245,"Director and Quatic series creator Tsui Hark bravely put a new twist on the legend of Wong Fei-Hung in this fifth chapter in the series. As emphasized by other reviewers here, firearms are fairly prevalent in this episode: although they complement rather than overshadow the martial-arts action. Personally, to see WFH dodging bullets whiled kicking heads made for lively viewing. Man Cheuk Chui plays Wong Fei-Hung pretty well but, in the acting/charisma stakes, he's obviously no Jet Li. Where he does shine is in the well choreographed action scenes. Spinning and kicking for all his worth, here he does give Jet a run for his money! In fact, all of Wong's sidekicks are given space to show off their martial moves, with Clubfoot in particular displaying some powerful kicking.",1256083200,4,780,5.054263565891473
7878508,4,6304856245,This is an action packed movie. Its set in China with Wong Fei Hung. The choreography is very good and its allot of action and good story line. The movie isn't remastered but the quality is ok. Its worth the money. And this is a hard film to find let alone DVD. Whats great about this movie is some of the actions scenes on the boat. These guys really worked on this film well. And tried to show some of China's best martial arts.,1197849600,3,430,4.130952380952381

In conclusion, while it doesn't reach the epic heights of the earlier Jet Li chapters, OUATIC 5 is a well-paced kung-fu movie that provides action, comedy and drama in equal measure.",1028937600,,976,4.993865030674846
