7924638,5,B00004W19I,"I bought this DVD because my son absolutley LOVES Toy Story and loves the Luxo, Jr. short before the film even more (if that's possible).  This DVD promised 2 Luxo, Jr. film shorts- so I thought- hey- for the $ - why not try it?!  Well, I am so glad I did! He loves it! It is the perfect length- just about an hour- and the films are really wonderful.  He really enjoys all of the films - especially the short film with the construction trucks.  If your little guy (or gal) loves Toy Story and the Luxo, Jr. film shorts- I highly recommend this DVD. Oh- and perhaps best of all- Amazon had it to my house in 2 business days shipping.  How wonderful!",992304000,2,649,4.16
