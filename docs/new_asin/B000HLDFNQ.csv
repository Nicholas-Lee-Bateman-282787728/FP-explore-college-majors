2639018,4,B000HLDFNQ,"Anyone thinking they are getting a collection of Shirley Temple the Child Star movies will be disappointed. Those who have read the description know that Shirley does not star in ALL the shows, but rather serves as the narrator/hostess. These were shot on video, not film, so as mentioned, the quality is not excellent. However, the production values and special effects for the day (1960) are very good. Wonderful selection of classic children's stories starring many famous stars of the day. Watching these with your child (probably recommended for the younger tots) will be a treat, and might encourage them to explore the classic books that these are based upon.",1186790400,9,666,5.0636363636363635
2639019,5,B000HLDFNQ,AS a big fan of Shirley Tample it was great to get all of these classics in one set. My family love to sit every Sunday morning and watch a Shirly Temple classic and these stories give us a much wider selection and a chance to see Sirley as she grew up..,1174521600,3,254,3.9038461538461537

2639022,2,B000HLDFNQ,"I was born in the mid-seventies and have always enjoyed watching the classic Shirley Temple movies.  When I saw this collection I thought it would be a great way to introduce Miss Temple to my daughter while also watching some of the fun stories she's familiar with acted out.  I was very wrong.

First of all, Shirley Temple is in her mid-thirties and only narrates the stories.  There are some pieces where she does play a small part but the show mostly focuses on other child actors and guest stars such as Jonathan Winters, Agnes Moorehead, etc.  It was like watching cheap plays done at an elementary school.  The acting and writing are very poor and the production and set quality are also poor.

There is a reason this TV show was cancelled after only one season.  My daughter lost interest after only three mintues and I did after five.  I am giving this away to our local library.",1167523200,66,889,4.540880503144654

2639025,5,B000HLDFNQ,"Tasty as can be.  If you're old enough to remember the show from childhood, you won't be disappointed.
It's a shame more of the previous Fairytale Theater, in black and white, isn't as easily purchased.  Reluctant Dragon is a masterpiece.",1435017600,,238,4.925

2639031,4,B000HLDFNQ,"I am astonished how many people on here didn't read the product description and just thought that it was a collection of Shirley's films as a child.  Gawd, and you people vote?

Anyway, the original color videotapes look quite good and seem to be well preserved.  And speaking of well preserved, Shirley looks more like 23 than 33 (her age when these were done).  The productions themselves are all bit stagy (being shot in a TV studio) and Shirley's adult acting is merely adequate, but there is a charm about them nevertheless, being from a simpler time when a lot of TV was still shot in a studio and the story was more important than the special effects.",1417305600,2,658,4.5508474576271185

2639037,3,B000HLDFNQ,"Enjoyed the dvds because it brought back memories of watching Shirley's fairytale show on TV many years ago. They were done on a sound stage with simple backdrops and in some shows a minimum of props and scenery. The acting and the action at times left something to be desired, but I have always enjoyed seeing Shirley perform. Shirley did use some big name stars in her productions.",1396224000,,383,4.647058823529412

2639068,5,B000HLDFNQ,"I must confess that my original intention for buying this video was to see the excellent color video that was recorded in the early 60's. NBC was the only network broadcasting in color at that time and I wanted to see how good those old RCA Color cameras captured color. Well, I'm most impressed with the excellent color fidelity and resolution that this video has. But while watching the video I was drawn into this magical world that Shirley Temple created. Jonathan Winters is so very good as are the other wonderful stars. So.... I highly recommend this video not only for its technical excellence but also for its enchanting story telling!",1345161600,6,644,4.758928571428571

2639071,5,B000HLDFNQ,"Before missy Duvall became the known god of the fairy tale realm, Shirley Temple Black had a storybook world of her own. i still think Shelley Duvall pretty much owns this territory, but Temple's storybook NBC theater was the first and it is retro television excellence not to be dismissed.
  Temple's storybook play productions lack the sophistication and great writing quality of the Shelley Duvall Faerie plays, but they are always imaginative and lots of fun. the production values for television are among the best for that time. not to mention what it might lack in the cerebral it makes up in true class.
  not to say that M.s. Temple Black isn't a smart woman. on the contrary. she was often a ruthless politician and a very quick witted one. need i say more? she was no inoccent child or liitle girl. her storybook theater probably gives more insight into the remarkable brilliance of the woman probably more than anything else she's done in entertainment. but she was a adorable movie tyke however and a lot of us love her in everything she does. but for me personally, it's not the ethereal Hollywood star child moppett i relate to, it's the adult, grown-up woman producer of great entertainment.",1329436800,,1207,4.788461538461538

disappointed in this purchase.",1325376000,,269,4.428571428571429

2639074,4,B000HLDFNQ,"Most of the unhappy reviews are from people who bought it without a clue what it was going to be.  There are gobs of Shirley Temple collections out there, including some good ones, as well as a set of shorts she appeared in before she became famous, so you have to know what you are ordering.  I knew this was from a series of dramatizations of fairy tales and popular stories hosted by Shirley Temple around 1960.  I expected the quality to be very poor, like old Kinescopes.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Though they look like videotape, they are in color and look pretty good, considering.  Undeniably watchable.  In some she is only a host-narrator (a couple are entirely puppet productions), while in others she has a strong role.  These are comparable to videotaped stage plays, except that these were edited productions, not live performances.  But the production values if performed on stage today would not be much different.  At least one of these was performed before an audience.  And there are some delights to be seen, like the campy scenes with the Sea Witch (Nina Foch) and her underwater advisor (Ray Walston) in The Little Princess.  A great chance to see some very fine actors and actresses in performances that haven't been available for 50 years.  A note on packaging:  While the photos of the product shows a boxed set, the set I received was held together by only a sleeve.",1316044800,7,1396,4.714876033057851

2639076,4,B000HLDFNQ,"""Shirley Temple's Storybook"" (aka ""The Shirley Temple Show"") was a successful television series (that ran in colour on NBC between 1958 and 1961) where Miss Temple hosted and more often than not, starred in, adaptations of fairy tale classics and other works of children's literature. Serving as the precursor to other shows like ""Faerie Tale Theatre"" and ""Tall Tales and Legends"", ""Shirley Temple's Storybook"" boasted a galaxy of stars from stage and screen, elaborate production values and lavish costumes.

Based on the Rudyard Kipling novel, the story follows the incredible adventure of one small boy (Tony Haig) upon whose shoulders rested the entire fate of the British army. Co-starring Michael Rennie and Alan Napier.

WINNIE THE POOH

THE LAND OF OZ
Based on ""The Marvelous Land of Oz"" by L. Frank Baum. Princess Ozma (Shirley Temple) is transformed into a boy called Tip, by the witch Mombi (Agnes Moorehead).

2639085,5,B000HLDFNQ,"I loved Shirley Temple as a child growing up.  As an adult, I wanted the movies for my children and grand children to enjoy.  They are from an era that no one would be ashamed to show their children.  This particular collection, I found quite interesting.  It was something that I had not had the priviledge of seeing when I was younger, quite enjoyable and set in a way that children really like.  This is a neat way for young children to see some of the cute stories of all time.",1266364800,,481,4.241758241758242
2639086,5,B000HLDFNQ,"This product was most likely low budget but to be honest with you it is actually enjoyable to watch. Basically its similar to Barney or similar show 6 disks with 2 one hour shows on them. Many old timer comedians such as Agnes Morehead (from what some of us remember as bewitched)and others of the 1961 timeframe. Some might like it only for the value of seeing an adult Shirley Temple. Otherwise great for the kids without the going green mentality by most shows now a days. I recommend it for all Shirley Temple fans, past and present.",1265932800,16,537,4.489795918367347
2639087,3,B000HLDFNQ,"I bought this collection on the strength of my very fond memories of one of the stories in this collection (with Shirley as the Mermaid). I have to say I was disappointed to see this show again. Was my imagination so great back then that I imagined scenes that really were never there? Apparently so!! Either that, or this is an edited copy!

Things that did not bother me at all as a child bother me a LOT now as an adult -- like poor stage makeup and theatrical acting on film. I saw too much theater here, making it all seem more ""fake."" I have looked at the beginnings of two or three stories in this collection but could not bring myself to finish any of them (except the one about the mermaid which disappointed me so). I'll try another one or two and then I will probably give the whole collection to Goodwill. Sorry, Shirley. I'll always love you anyway!!!!",1245888000,3,865,4.339506172839506
2639088,5,B000HLDFNQ,"As the product's name suggests, the Shirley Temple Storybook Collection contains previously unavailable episodes from the star's short-lived fairytale TV series, The Shirley Temple Show.  Shirley serves as your endearing host and navigator as the hottest stars of the `60s parade through several DVDs of familiar and less-known fables and fairy tales.  Several notes to the prospective buyer: Shirley is a fully grown young woman by this time, so please don't go into this expecting an adorable little girl.  Secondly, although Shirley hosts every episode and is occasionally engaged as a minor role, she is not the star in these features--that job is delegated to luminaries such as Landau and Moorehead.

That said; this DVD pack is an excellent opportunity for the avid Shirley Temple fan to expand their collection with material that hadn't been available for nearly fifty years.  Fans would also enjoy the opportunity to see the star in her later years, since we all too-often neglect that phase of her career in favor of our idealized childhood image of the actress.  In any event, this pack is an excellent value for the money and an equally excellent way to expose children to a Disney-free version of popular stories (because why should one company have a monopoly on your children's minds?)",1228089600,91,1300,5.07981220657277

2639090,5,B000HLDFNQ,"If children need a positive role model, they can look to Shirley Temple. I've baby-sat children from a couple of generations now, and it doesn't matter if the movies are in black and white or color, when they watch Shirley, they are enthralled (and consequently it's much easier to put them to bed!). These stories are hosted by an older Shirley Temple, I remember them from my childhood. They have wonderful casts and are in color. Dear Arthur Treacher is ""In the Land of Oz"", the Fabulous Jonathan Winters is in ""Babes in Toyland"". You won't find sophisticated special effects, just good old-fashioned family-viewable programmes. And you can remind your children that Shirley went on to become a distinguished and well-liked ambassador to Ghana and Czechoslovakia. She had a fabulous motion picture career without having to misbehave to make headlines. So get your children away from their ipods and text phones and sit together and enjoy these films and each others company for a change. You might like it!",1198540800,3,1009,4.976331360946745

8140357,3,B000HLDFNQ,"It was an entertaining DVD's collection. However, I thought it was the complete and entire collection of the ""Shirley Temple Show,"" but disappointingly, it only included few hand picked series, amongst the many series in this wonderful TV show that ran from 1958 thru 1961. It should state as a pack, not a collection. It was a lot of fun, with many musicals, and theatricals. Our family enjoyed it. It was a very nice ""Shirley Temple Story Book Show"" DVD Pack.
