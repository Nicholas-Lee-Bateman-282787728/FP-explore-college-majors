687202,2,6303575617,"The story is set deep in the Panama jungles, six rangers under the command of Sgt. West went on a training mission in the midst of a hurricane, but only two returned.  Basic follows the exploits of Tom Hardy, an ex-army special force personnel brought in by the base commander to find out as much information as possible in regards to the events transpired during that period, before Washington is alerted of the situation.  As time is running out, he must find a way to gain the cooperation of the survivors, and to sieve the truths from the lies.
Deception is their most dangerous weapon.
Misdirection employed subtly and tastefully can work to great advantage for a movie, such as the ones in The Usual Suspects.  Unfortunately, Basics blatant use of this device is ultimately the reason why the film failed to work.  By the time a third version of what took place at the time of the exercise is told, it becomes so obvious that this account is just as preposterous as the previous two.  Instead of applauding at the cleverness of the plot twists, I often wondered to myself when will they finally get to the point and address some of the loose details previously introduced in the story.  There were some interesting angles that could have been explored further, but apparently the movie was more concerned about uncovering a conspiracy that is both ridiculous and unbelievable.  The funniest thing about Basic is that for a film that spent a good amount of its running time searching for the so-called truth, the premise of the movie was never adequately resolved, and the payoff at the end is as unsatisfying as it is shallow.
Luckily, the acting in Basic is fairly solid all around.  John Travolta returns to fine form playing the resourceful and charismatic Tom Hardy.  Demonstrating his versatility in the portrayal of his role, Travolta is sometimes flamboyant, other times humorous, but constantly engaging and a treat to watch. .  Connie Nielsen is likeable enough as Lt. Julia Osborne, the head of the military police at the base.  However, her character lacks depth and seems to function simply as a way to build the sexual tension between the two leads.  To be fair, Travolta and Nielsen did have good chemistry together, as well as providing the audiences with couple of good laughs.  Basic also reunites Travolta with co-star Samuel L. Jackson since their memorable performances in Pulp Fiction.  Even though Jackson does a decent job as the hard-nosed Sgt. Nathan West, he was not on screen nearly as much as I wouldve liked to see.
Basic is a convoluted movie that has one too many twists for its own good.  A poorly scripted plot that made very little sense ruined what could have been an excellent suspense film, something that even a talented cast as this one couldn't save.  Dont go in with a high expectation and you might not walk away disappointed, otherwise, I would recommend you skip Basic altogether.",1048896000,3,2930,4.783730158730159
687203,2,6303575617,"Typically, a good suspense movie ties all it's loose ends at the conclusion. For instance, at the end of ""the sixth sense"" you feel as shocked as Willis' character that you didn't figure it out sooner. Not the case here. At this ""climactic"" conclusion, you don't know what to believe. An over abundance of plot twists (without reasonable explanations) hampered what could have been an entertaining story line. This was combined with an ending that was so light-hearted and ridiculous, even Travolta sat looking troubled and confused at the outcome he was involved in. The movie's intent may have been to get people talking about it. Here they have succeeded. For with so few concrete facts, the entire movie becomes a matter of opinion. Yet, much like the movie itself, the more you discuss the un-answered questions, the more un-answered questions you find. No doubt upon it's DVD release a ""directors cut"" will be offered, that promises to make sense of the theatrical release. So your best bet would be to wait until then and just rent it.",1048896000,,1042,4.859550561797753
687204,5,6303575617,"I loved this movie, it is a must see twice to appreciate it type movie (mainly because of the surprise ending), but worth seeing again!  The plot is convoluted, but  keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way to the final scene. John Travolta is funny, charming, and charismatic, and I will probably go see this movie at least two more times to be able to totally appreciate the plot.  No, you will never be able to figure out who's the bad guy, who's the good guy, and what really happened (or didn't) but it isn't a mystery, so who cares! I like to see movies that are ""entertaining"", I'm not looking for some deep story, etc, and entertaining it is!",1048809600,3,656,4.274193548387097
687205,4,6303575617,"With all due respect to Terri's review below, I have a question:  Were we watching the same video?
I consider myself to be an intermediate exerciser, having worked out on a regular basis for about 5 years.  I'd been thinking about getting a lower body only tape; I finally chose this because I also have Cory's Get Hard Arms and Shoulders (excellent) and Kardio Kick (a decent kickboxing tape for beginners or a light cardio day for intermediate/advanced exercisers), and I like her style.
As others have noted, Cory includes gym machines in this tape, but she concentrates (and is front and center) teaching the home version.  This is NOT a gym only workout (if it were, I wouldn't have hesitated to return it).  Since she does the reps slowly, you can use as heavy weights as you want.  (Beginners may want to learn proper form first before using this tape since she only gives a few form pointers.)  She really works the quadriceps, calves, and hamstrings well, and even throws in some abs work at the end (basic crunches).  Note that you may want to use ankle weights for some of the exercises, and the calf step ups require a step.
Another exercise she does is called a Good Morning.  Although I'd heard of it, I'd never done this one before; it works the lower back.  I'd caution anyone who hasn't done this before to do it the first couple of times without weights (Cory pretty much says the same thing).  The first time I did it, I felt a little tug down there, so I immediately got rid of the weights.  Anyone with back problems should probably just skip this exercise.
A couple of not so good things:  1. No warm up (she *does* stretch between sets) and 2. She has you putting on and taking off ankle weights instead of doing all the ankle weighted exercises together.  The warm up you can do on your own, so that was no big deal.  As for No. 2, it irritated me at first, but I've since gotten used to it.
All in all, a very good tape.  I give it an A-.  And if you want some more reviews, pro and con, check out [...] (click on Video Reviews).",1031875200,6,2054,4.36578947368421
687206,2,6303575617,"I bought this video but ended up returning it.  It's not for a home workout but more a gym tutorial.  Plus it is not done in Cory's normal style. Sorry Cory...  If you are looking for some really good tapes by Cory, I highly recommend these three:  Cory Everson Get Hard - Arms and Shoulders; Cory Everson Get Hard - Abdominals and Glutes; Cory Everson's Total Workout.  I use these three tapes weekly and am sore after each workout.",1028937600,2,433,4.430379746835443
687207,5,6303575617,"When I got this tape as a gift recently, I was somewhat reluctant because of the ""80s"" look of the video, figuring that it might be outdated in terms of proper form.  However, I'm very pleased with the workout on this tape.  It really focuses on pure muscle building and/or toning, and demonstrates how to alter each exercise based on the weight machines you have available to you (in my case, none... I prefer free weights at home, and it still worked great for me)  Ignoring the clothes on Cory and friends, it's a very modern workout.  I've since read some of Cory's books, and have come to be impressed by both her foresight and expertise on fitness issues, as well as become an admirer of Cory-Everson-the-person.  She's a great role model!",1003190400,3,745,4.613636363636363
687208,5,6303575617,I enjoyed the video greatly. Cory shows you how to lift weights the right way to keep your form when doing lifts. She explains everything in a straight forward easy way. This video would be great for anyone starting  and not knowing the first thing about proper weight training. I would  recommed this to any woman no matter what age. I'm 47 weight training  made  me stronger and it didn't hurt my golf game either.,948844800,13,416,4.506666666666667

687260,5,6303575617,"Roger Ebert wrote a very bad review of this movie. That is one of the reason I like this movie so much. Ebert thought that he could pan this based upon the fact that it could not be understood. In telling us it could not be understood, Ebert's review is exposed as just the reprehensibility critics can stoop to. The movie provides the answers to what is going on as they are revealed by an investigation. Now, anyone who has ever done real criminal investigation knows that it takes a bit of brain power to unravel the mystery, the data that is hidden, twisted data and the lies and irrelevant data that comes one's way during an investigation. So, for Ebert to have said what he said means he didn't apply himself to figuring it out whatsoever. But more than that, Ebert, got lost himself. The movie lays it all out. Those who apply themselves to the mystery know they had to listen, spot the contrary data, the lies, and understand as the movie went on that the plot twists Ebert disliked so much were simply revelation points of usable data, sign posts so to speak, on the way to successfully solving the puzzle. This movie was quite clever, completely sequitur and actually followed all the steps in dialogue and events to allow the movie goers to solve the plot of the movie. Ebert, in my opinion was a joke as a critic and his review of this movie tells us more about Ebert than he would have liked for us to know. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes to exercise his gray matter and be entertained while doing. The movie is actually a very good primer in Basic investigation practice. Every actor in the movie did a fine job; and the direction was flawless as was the writing.",1504310400,5,1690,4.437299035369775

He really personifies someone that trains military member.  It is almost hard to decide who the main character is, but I would say John Travolta played an amazing supporting role in this movie.  I didn't really find Tim Daly as a believable character.  It was almost like he was doing this movie because he was politically forced to; meaning he seems to have put up his best effort but just didn't quite come through like the other characters.  But, in the grand scheme of things it is hard for anyone to shine when Travolta and Jackson are starring in the same movie.",1468281600,2,698,4.323076923076923

The story is cool. John Travolta is lead down a dark path while investigating the disappearance of some special ops soldiers. Everything leads him to think they are bad guys. Then there is a plot twist. (I'll spare you the details) and the whole thing wraps up cleanly.

The problem isn't the movie overall, it's the clean wrap up. It's just silly.

I will never know John Travolta. I will only be able to judge John Travolta by his acting and for me he is always entertaining, no matter how many iterations he goes through.
Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Daly, Connie Nielsen and  the always under rated Giovanni Ribisi are just a few of the stars gracing this who done it  about a legendary officer, killed on a training mission in the jungle. The plot gets a little labyrinthine in the middle but hang in there and it ends up being a fun romp.
As they say in the movie, you just have to get your stories straight.",1406419200,2,726,4.443609022556391
687682,5,6303575617,"This is a great movie, lots of plot twists, when under interrogation different characters tell the story of what happened differently, it keeps you guessing.  After the first time I watched this movie I wanted to go back and watch it again immediately after, I don't think I can say that about any other movie.  Watching it additional times is still a blast, it's not one of those plot-twist-heavy movies that are like ""once you've seen it, then you've seen it.""

A lot of the 1 star reviews for this movie are people upset that there's almost no action (this isn't an action movie, it's an investigation movie), and so many others ding it heavily because the military garb is not regulation (people aren't wearing the right hats or pants...wow).  Yes, it's not a totally perfectly true-to-life movie, but how many are?  And how much do the hats really matter?

If you like great movies with suspense and great plots (not to mention excellent actors and performances), then this movie is for you.  If you want a movie who's primary concern is that people are wearing the right color hat, then I guess you'll want to pass.",1406160000,,1121,4.659898477157361

The team must navigate through the jungle in hurricane conditions. They are to use live fire to hit targets and then rendezvous us to a bunker. Problem is, not all of the army rangers meet at the bunker and it turns out Nathan West is dead. Someone on the team killed Nathan and now the team must find out who killed him while staying alive themselves. Since only a couple of members from the team are alive, Colonel Bill Styles calls an experienced interrogator, Tom Hardy (John Travolta) who's an ex-ranger, to interrogate Dunbar and Kendall (the only 2 men alive) with Captain Julia Osborne (Connie Nielsen) by his side. Both Dunbar and Kendall have different stories as to what happened. Is Dunbar lying? Is it Kendall who's lying? Or, is neither story correct?

The performances are solid and the film is engaging and fun to watch. The film keeps you guessing, and when you think you have the answer, you find yourself not even close to the answer. You're going to be misled and manipulated throughout the whole film, but for me it worked. The characters were interesting enough for me to care about, and it's hard not to like John Travolta.

Basic has many plot twists and turns, and for some people, that's a turnoff. There's no doubt, this is a pretty good popcorn flick, but it may not be for everyone. Some people will stop caring and some will feel very cheated at the end; I'm not one of those people and I like to watch Basic once in a blue moon.

And then of course the nerdy weird, quirky, gay intellectual (played by Giovani Ribisi) who would NEVER even attempt to complete Ranger School...because he would washed out of infantry school. And Samuel Jackson just plain sucks. If you want to make yourself a movie with generic written all over it- get Samuel Jackson to star in it. Yeah.  He plays the same annoying loud mouth jackass in EVERY movie. How this guy makes a living with his obnoxious acting is beyond me.  Decent plot for the film, but badly executed. The acting and casting is a disgrace to Army Rangers....period. I should have known this was a s*** movie when I saw noticed Samuel Jackson wearing a beret incorrectly on the damn cover art.

687879,2,6303575617,"OK. This is one of those twists & turns flicks that takes you on a roller-coaster ride as the plot zigs one way and then zags the other way. Which is fine. Unless the movie is based on some people sitting around in a room trying to think up a good movie and coming up with a plot wound around the twists & turns approach... simply because it is a proven formula. It's called putting the cart before the horse.

In short, the negative reviews of this movie are dead on. I streamed it up on Netflix, not because it had Jackson (who seems to be in about every other movie these days), or because of Travolta (because he is not a sure bet in a film), but because of Nielsen, who is a fabulous actress, and, if you check out her bio, one hell of a talented human being in general. But her great talent was not put to good use in this film. Rather, she was turned into a tough, kick-ass cop, who can throw a man twice her size and weight across the room with a quick-cut martial art move (another proven formula that those folks sitting around in a room came up with for this flick).

But the other, more interesting device employed in this film is the multiple viewpoint story, where each witness to an event tells a slightly different version of the ""truth"". In this flick you have the witnesses intentionally lying about what happened though. Far more interesting is the adaptation where each witness to the event tells the absolute truth about what they saw, yet they all contradict each other. This version of the varying witness accounts has more application to real life. We all can recall times when we have experienced a dilemma of this sort in our own lives. It's an aspect of the human condition, and can be quite disturbing at times.

The quintessential multiple account story told in movie form could well be Akira Kurosawa's 'Rashomon' from 1950. If you don't care for subtitled foreign films, Kurosawa's script was adapted for the Western audience in 1964 as 'The Outrage', starring William Shatner and Edward G. Robinson.

There's also an adaption of this general motif utilized by the great Alfred Hitchcock in his 1950's made for TV series ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents' entitled 'I Killed the Count'. In this venue multiple people all confess to the same murder, and there is physical evidence supporting each person's story!

And finally a bonus 4th title: 'The Situation' with Connie Nielsen brings home the point of how elusive the ""truth"" can be in a story of a Journalist seeking such in Iraq.

Any one of these titles will provide more satisfaction than the product of self-abuse upchucked up by those folks who sit around in a room coming up with ways to lighten our wallets.",1342828800,,2692,4.574688796680498

The objective was interrogation of the two survivors. Jackson is the over the top brutal training sergeant who is seen in flashbacks as the questioning elicited conflicting stories of his death. He played the part to the hilt. Nielsen as the official interrogator is pretty convincing. There are times when the film seems  to lose momentum but soon gets back on track with some bit of action.

687924,1,6303575617,"Travolta's films can be categorized into two categories: Pulp Fiction and Everything Else. Basic, of course, belongs to the latter. This movie is like watching an episode of Law & Order with a bigger budget. It is so formulaic, using the ""twists 'n turns"" strategy of past films to create a senseless story whose ending negates the need for its making in the first place.

Top Ten Sign of Cliches include but are not limited to:
1. Sexual tension between Travolta and the female lead
2. The whodunnit flashbacks that are told differently each time by each person involved
3. The drug smuggling plot carried out by the law abiding, upright guy you'd never think was the crook
4. The ""usual suspects"" type ending where pieces of the puzzle all fall into place at the final moments
5. The main character who has a drinking problem (just for the sake of flavor)
6. Fights and shouting scenes you can seeing coming a mile away
7. Constant backtracking by the main characters and the need to confront potential suspects again, each time with angrier words and fist throwing
8. The mimicking environment rain storm that underscores the tension, and when Big Revelations are discovered, ""Crack!"" goes the lightning
9. The military's knee-jerk response to everything: shut out outsiders and hope the problem goes away
10. Opening narrative that tries to create a theme for the whole picture, but fails (maybe you can figure it out)

687927,4,6303575617,"This is the lower body workout from Cory's Basic Sculpting Series.  It is about 30 minutes long and works your lower half nicely.  Cory is joined here by Michelle and Dave, Michelle demonstrates the exercises on machines that are found in fitness spas, Dave demonstrates on machines found in weight training or bodybuilding gyms, and Cory demonstrates using home equipment.

There is no formal warmup, Cory and friends are all on various exercise machines (bike, stepper, Nordictrack style machine) warming up while Cory talks about the workout and what you are going to be doing.  I would have preferred a warmup but I can just use another video or march in place while she is talking.

The workout follows, she does 2 sets of 15 reps of these exercises:

squats
leg (quad) extensions (Cory uses ankle weights and does both legs at once)
lunges
hamstring curls (one leg at a time)
leg press (Cory does sissy squats)
step ups (similar to the tall box step ups/leg press seen in Firm videos)
calf raises
hyper extensions/Good Mornings
ab work/crunches

I do make some modifications to these exercises, I personally didn't care for the sissy squats so I sub plie squats in place of those.  For the hyper extensions/Good Mornings, I subbed dead lifts as I didn't feel comfortable with a barbell on my shoulders and bending forward.  I think someone not familiar with proper form could really hurt themselves.

This workout is definitely doable for those who are limited to home equipment, even though it make not appear so.  Some might get annoyed with the taking on/off ankle weights between other exercises, I personally didn't mind too much, gives me a chance to catch my breath anyway.

I really like these workouts and have all three in the series.  They are short but thorough, plus I like Cory as an instructor.  She is pleasant but down to earth and laid back.  Plus her shape is very inspiring.

These tapes were made in 1995 so they may appear dated to some, I have videos that are much older though so it doesn't bother me. The setting is clean but plain and the music is mostly instrumental keyboard music.

Overall, I would recommend these to those already familiar with weight training as the form pointers could be a little better.  But they really are suitable for all levels, advanced people might find them a little boring.  They are right up my alley though, good for those who like simple straightforward weight lifting.  4 and a half stars!",1237593600,,2458,4.752358490566038
687928,4,6303575617,"This movie was really good. Some people just don't appreciate these types of movies. After reading some of the other reviews, I can understand how some people did not like this movie. Some of the twists and events are fairly farfetched, but all movies are like that. If you go into a movie pessimistic than your bound to dislike it. I did like this movie very much, and I thought it had a lot of qualities that made it a very compelling story. The character played by John Travolta is a quick-witted DEA agent who doesn't follow the rules and is hard on the bottle. His counterpart, the character played by Connie Nielsen, is the exact opposite; a very by-the-book kind of person who never deviates from her objective. Together, they have the task of finding out what happened to a group of army rangers during a training exercise in the jungles of Panama, where only one of them returned. This movie reminded me of Courage Under Fire, another war drama that involves the lengthy investigation of the deaths of soldiers during an unknown event. If you liked Courage Under Fire then you will love Basic because Basic has more action and great actors like John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. This movie has so many twists that you have to pay attention to every second of the movie, but that's easy because the movie is so intensely entertaining. You may not get the story the first time watching the movie but the second time you will and you'll be glad you did. Another winning quality of this movie that had me going was the grade-A cast. The entire cast was spot on in the movie and every word and action was totally convincing and compelling. I didn't even recognize one of the actors in the movie until the very end, when she was in civilian clothes. That's how well they were played. Every movie that Samuel L. Jackson is usually good because he is such a unique character and I thought he was excellent in the movie. If you like Samuel L. than you'll like this movie because he acts the stereotype of the sadistic drill sergeant to the bone. Overall I thought Basic was a superb movie with its ridiculous twists and witty remarks.

687929,5,6303575617,"Panama after the Reagan's military intervention. The American armed forces are trying to keep the main passage of south American drug up north to the US under control. But that does not mean it is really what happens. In fact drug is flowing abundantly but not freely. Things have to be organized in the hands of the US citizens here, at least some of them, under a uniform or not. In one of the military special, very special units the sergeant discovers the truth and wants to stop it when on a mission. He will end up dead and several other members too, but the transportation of the drug out of the jungle and onto a plane to the US, along with one of the bodies will nearly succeed, though it will fail because the special agent and the female captain he is teaming with find out some details neither knew that imply the colonel is taking his share to let the drug go through. But nothing is that simple and that captain is going to discover even more and then she will be disarmed - psychologically though not militarily - and the film closes the way it had opened on Ravel's Bolero, that music that is a constant cyclical return of just a few notes. Will she go along with the survivors, and the special agent who seems to be the real coordinator, including of the killing of the sergeant? Difficult to know, though she accepts to eat with the administratively absent ones. It is interesting to go back to these films of an older time. 2003 was the time of another military adventure after a previous one a year before. The film was more or less trying to foresee the future of a military adventure in a foreign country. A real catastrophe because it brings rot right into the deepest inner circle of the republic, the armed forces. Five years later the lesson is clear cut and brilliant. Any military adventure that is based on the invasion of a country in order to bring down the local leader and take him to prison in a way or another for any reason you can imagine, in Panama it was drugs, in Iraq it was weapons of mass destruction, can only end up in rot and a full deception. What did Noriega want to do? Nationalize or take control of the Panama canal? Ronald Reagan when he was the Governor of California said: ""the Canal Zone is not a colonial possession. It is not a long-term lease. It is sovereign United States territory, every bit the same as Alaska and all the states that were carved from the Louisiana Purchase. We should end those negotiations and tell the General: we bought it, we paid for it, we build it, and we intend to keep it."" When he became the President of the US he toppled Noriega and took control of the canal zone. And in may 2008 the son of the general who nationalized the canal was praised by Bush for all the good work he is doing to develop the canal that is a national enterprise of Panama. You can never stop history. You can slow it down, but not stop it. It will go on in its direction and those who will have tried to stop it and will have slowed it down will also have brought onto the world a dire vengeance. History always has the last word. When you see practically the whole South America in the elected hands of what Ronald Reagan would have called communists you wonder if it was really worth it to invade Panama and to invade Granada and a few other things like that. When we see the Panamanian fiasco thirty years later we can wonder what the Iraqi fiasco is going to be in thirty years. The film is telling us that any invasion of a country produces in the medium run the completely reverse effect than the one expected in the very short run. And in the end it is those who resist the rot, corruption, in other words the innocent, that end up dead in such an adventure.

The plot(a DEA agent investigates the dissapearance of one of his former military colleagues and learns two seperate stories about what happened,creating trouble)is just as intelligent as it is brilliant. Add that together with suspenseful scenes,twists,turns,and even dialogue,alongside a top-notch cast(John Travolta,Samuel L.

Yet,despite all of the strong and admirable qualities of ""Basic"",there is something about it that fails. As opposed to ""going by the book"",""Basic"" takes crucial parts of its story and takes the road less traveled and expected. Sure--it is something that can work great and make a film/television show/television show episode richly executed,if not better than the regular road. But,for ""Basic"",it completely fails. It is a method that turns ""Basic"" from being intelligent to being dumb--not making any sense in the end and leaving a bad aftertaste. Sure--it only applies for a few scenes. But--it applies for some of the most crucial scenes of ""Basic"". Once it is finished,there is no turning back. It is as dominant to ""Basic"" as anything in a real military base would be.

Overall,a film where the gamble didn't pay off. Worth to see for the unique and creative qualities--but be prepared for a large dissapointment in the end.

Jackson's and Giovanni Ribisi's performances feel like parodies of their performances in better movies.

687947,4,6303575617,"I need to provide some backstory on my viewing experience of John McTiernan's 2003 military thriller ""Basic"". Is there such a thing as a ""military thriller""? Ah, never mind. Anyway, I rented a copy of ""Basic"" and let it sit on the DVD player for a few days before I got around to watching it. Big mistake. Between the time when I picked up the disc and when I popped it in the player, I came down with a serious cold. I'm talking a SERIOUS cold. The type of cold that makes you wish they sold Kleenex by the metric ton. The sort of cold where you breathe through your mouth because your nasal passages feel like someone packed them full of cement with a cannon ramrod. I did the only sane thing a person could do: I loaded up with cold medication. Cough syrup, aspirin, anti-histamines, cough drops, nasal spray--you name it, I was taking it by the handfuls. The resulting effect of my medicinal intake, I must say, can only be described as kaleidoscopic. I felt like my head had turned into a balloon filled with laughing gas. It was in this state of mind that I viewed ""Basic"".

That was a big mistake, as we'll see shortly. ""Basic"" begins by showing us a routine military training mission in the jungles of Panama. Amidst a raging hurricane, Sergeant Nathan West (Samuel L. Jackson) runs his team of Army Rangers ragged. He's a tough guy, as tough as a steel pipe, and all of the members of his squad despise him. Then a tragedy unfolds out in the jungle, a tragedy that claims the life of West and several other members of the squad. Only two survive, in fact. In order to figure out what happened, the Army brings in crack investigator Tom Hardy (John Travolta) to solve the mystery. Tom's an ex-Ranger and a DEA agent currently under investigation for unethical behavior. The base's commander and Hardy's pal Styles (Tim Daly) teams Tom up with a southern belle, Lieutenant Osborne (Connie Nielsen), and the two start interrogating the first survivor, Dunbar (Brian Van Holt). Tom's a whiz at questioning suspects, and he gets Dunbar's story--which we see unfold in flashback--in quick order. It's a weird tale about murder and mayhem out in the jungle. Of course, several details don't really match up with the facts, so Hardy and Osborne must move on to the next survivor.

Kendall (Giovanni Ribisi) lies in a hospital bed recovering from his injuries when our two heroes show up to start the questioning. His story, which we also see in flashback, differs from Dunbar's tale of woe in significant ways. As Hardy and Osborne begin to examine the threads winding their way through the two stories, they uncover more than they bargained for. They keep going back and forth between the two, Dunbar and Kendall, trying to pry more information out of them after confronting each one with their inconsistencies. Most alarmingly, Kendall suddenly dies in his hospital bed after bleeding out of every orifice in his head. Is this an attempt by someone or several someones to get him to shut up? Yes, yes it is. It can't be Dunbar because he's still locked up in another room on the base. Could it have something to do with one of the base physicians, Dr. Vilmer (Harry Connick, Jr.)? Maybe Colonel Styles knows more than he's letting on. He's Hardy's friend, but that doesn't mean he shares everything with him. Heck, what about Osborne? She seems like a straight arrow, but she couldn't get Dunbar to talk (which necessitated the arrival of Hardy). Maybe that was all an act to hide something.

I'm not going forward with more plot points because I don't want to spoil the film for you. Not that I could, mind you, since ""Basic"" ranks highly on my ""Most Confusing and Convoluted Films Ever to Emerge from Hollywood"" list. McTiernan and writer James Vanderbilt offer the viewer so many flashback scenarios, red herrings, and numerous plot twists that my head started hurting. Even more confusing was the tendency to tell further stories in the middle of flashbacks. Ouch! I just bailed on the story, blew my nose a couple of times, and tried to focus on things that made sense, like the performances. They're good. Travolta plays smart aleck pretty well, and Sam Jackson knows how to play an overbearing jerk. Connie Nielsen does an acceptable job, but that southern accent has to go, like, yesterday! It's nice to see Tim Daly in a major motion picture, and Giovanni Ribisi goes over the top as Kendall. The movie's atmosphere works well for such a murky murder mystery/conspiracy story, but the wind and crashing rain tend to drown out the dialogue. I was always fiddling with the volume control trying to understand what the characters were saying. I fiddled in vain.

I highly recommend you don't watch ""Basic"" while under the influence of cold medicine. A confusing film like this one becomes nearly unwatchable on Nyquil and anti-histamines. Having said that, I actually like it enough to give it four stars. I enjoy watching Italian murder mysteries called giallo, which often achieve heights of confusion more labyrinthine in execution than what ""Basic"" offered, so it's all to the good. The DVD version of the film offers us several extras, none of them very interesting. We get a boring commentary track with director McTiernan, an extended interview with writer Vanderbilt, and a lengthy lovefest with the actors. You've seen this last supplement a million times. It consists of interviews with the cast where everyone heaps praise on the film and on their fellow actors. Yadda, yadda, yadda. Whatever. If you're feeling adventurous, give ""Basic"" a shot.

687948,1,6303575617,"This movie should be shown to classrooms of aspiring screenwriters and directors as an example of how not to be sucked into the Hollywood junk machine. The screenwriter of this movie obviously had some ideas about a coherent story that he wanted to tell about moral relativity and corrupt military officials. This film's story structure is mostly influenced by the classic film Rashomon. Well, so what happened? How did this ungracious disaster of a movie make it to the big screen? The biggest culprits are easily the movie stars, John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, using their bloated star egos to force the screenwriter to rework his material into something they ultimately found more suitable to their star personas. Disgusting! Travolta was supposed to be a bad guy and Jackson was supposed to bite the bullet, but no way would the two Hollywood jerks allow that!

SPOILER ALERT: Who in their right mind was surprised by the ending? I knew Sam Jackson was in on it from the get go and soon enough he would grace us with his presence. Lo and behold, his bald head emerges at the end of the movie wearing a white outfit like an angel of some sort. I hate this movie, it's an insult to the audience!

687992,3,6303575617,"Sometimes I have a really difficult time distinguishing if I ask too much from media or if I should just go with the flow.  Most of those moments come after viewing such movies as this, where when it comes down to the craft-level of the film, there's nothing technically wrong with it, but the fact that it's utterly lacking in any sort of ""reason to be"" or theme just makes me feel I wasted my time.

A troupe of rangers-in-training and a legendary sergeant are in the midst of a hurricane in the Panama Canal when something goes awry.  We don't know what it is at first, but when a surveiling helicoptor notices one of the trainees shooting another, an investigation is started to find out what exactly is going amiss.

The movie itself is filled with people who have shown their ability to perform but don't necessarily guarantee a good performance.  Samuel L. Jackson plays one of his typecast roles.  John Travolta plays one of his typecast roles (Oh, and having them together in this movie doesn't make it a Pulp Fiction, I can tell you that).  Even Connie Nielson, who I like a lot, does her role and doesn't add to it.

Now the point of the movie is something like the point of a Shyamalan movie: let's make a twist and see how good we are at surprising the audience.  Now the thing about a Shyamalan movie is, even though his twists are getting rather ridiculous and even though they begin to feel a bit condescending, there's still a point to them.  A Shyamalan film has a theme, about fate, about human nature, about death, etc.  This film has twists because it wants to surprise.  However, to an audience that is used to having twists as a rather generic method of plot development, that leaves a lot to be desired.  Especially when such twists happen after a milieu of twists, so that by the time the movie ends you don't really care about any of the characters anymore because they've shedded so many identities that you're forced to believe they don't actually have one.

So we have an action film, by John McTiernan, who has already proven himself to be brilliant (c'mon, Die Hard...); we have performers who've already proven their worth; and we have a script that works out in its own way.  Yet none of it really matters.  And so even though it's an okay movie, it's still a waste of time.

Rated R for violence and language.

John McTiernan's (the mastermind behind ""Die Hard"") ""Basic"" opens up in a rain-drenched Panama jungle at night on an Army training mission headed by Sergeant West (Samuel L. Jackson). Flash forward to the next day. An Army chopper picks up two men from the training mission, one injured and one very much alive. The injured man, Kendall (Giovanni Ribisi), is sent to a hospital, and the alive man, Dunbar (Brian Van Holt) is sent in for questioning by the very sexy and very Southern Osborne (Connie Nielsen). Dunbar refuses to speak to anyone except a Ranger. So in comes Ranger Tom Hardy (John Travolta) to piece together the events surrounding the death of Sgt. West and his team.  Most of the film takes place at night, during a rainy hurricane, and adds to the nonexistent plot. What is so intriguing is that the plot isn't really there, but the writer tries to manifest one, and we feel as if we are staring at some nonexistant, material wad of words and flashbacks and images thrown together in a blender, the writer hoping for it to come out smelling of roses.

The writer of ""Basic"", James Vanderbilt (whose screen crudentials consist of ""Darkness Falls""), has so many twists and turns that the film is impossible to keep up with. It becomes hard to seperate present from past and what's real from what's not. So many revelations happen that the audience will feel they are in the middle of the writer's mind, as he comes up with new ideas and tries to squeeze them in time after time after time. There is a limit to how many times you can use ""surprise"" revelation endings. Vanderbilt uses three of four in a row, piled on top of each other, time after time after time. Just as we think the plot twists are done, and we start to smile because we think we might finally understand the basis of the plot, something else happens, and we zoom in suspensefully on John Travolta's face as he, along with the audience, realizes something.  The performances of Basic's cast are a mixed bag: Travolta is watchable as usual, and he brings a believable sense of self-assured cool to Hardy, but he is frustratingly unable to contain his hammy instincts. The quality of a Travolta performance appears to be inversely proportional to the volume of his voice.  When he's quiet, he's very good; when he yells, he quickly becomes a cartoon. This movie has enough credibility problems; it doesn't need a cartoon hero.

If Travolta is mixed news, Connie Nielsen is plain bad. It's not so much that she can't seem to make heads or tails of the convoluted story - heck, no one can. But she seems less to be stymied than just exceptionally stupid. The scenes that are supposed to establish romantic tension between her and Travolta fall laughably flat. To top it off, she is saddled with some Hollywood nimrod's notion of a Southern accent, which blinks on and off like a turn signal. The smaller roles, though, fare much better. Van Holt as the prisoner does especially well, flavoring his defiance with feral intelligence. There is also nice work by Taye Diggs as the unit's misfit and Tim Daly (where has he been since ""Wings"" folded?) as the base commander. The most memorable, though (and you sort of knew this already) is Jackson. He has the lunatic drill instructor bit down pat, and delivers it with relish. His is the one character in Basic who is supposed to be larger than life, in part because he is seen in flashback, which means that we are seeing not the man himself, but other people's impressions of him. In his commando sweater and poncho thrown over one shoulder like a warlord's cape, he looks twenty feet tall and invincible. Still, one of Jackson's great talents is his ability to project nuance and smarts to even the most unsubtle characters. His Sgt. West is the shadow leaning over the whole incident, and the movie would have been smart to take more advantage of that.  The real disappointment in the supporting cast is the normally talented Giovanni Ribisi as the wounded survivor, a hospital-ward weirdo who is supposed to seem mysterious but mostly comes off as jokey and annoying. Ribisi seems to have shoplifted his performance from Gary Oldman in ""Hannibal"", down to his marble-mouthed line deliveries.

Though ""Basic"" is shabbily conceived, it is at least presented well by John McTiernan, who manages to wring what tension may be had from the loopy script. The movie is lacking in the action set-pieces McTiernan usually employs, but he nails the atmosphere just right. The use of weather to convey emotion is certainly overdone, but it is still effective when done right, as it is here. The pounding, ever-present rain and the dim, shadow-tinged interior lighting gives the movie the feel of an approaching end, a kind of despairing resignation to horrible things. It's a shame that the drama can't keep up with its own visual metaphor.  It has its merits, but strains your suspension of disbelief beyond the breaking point, and washes its credibility away like bloodstains in a rainstorm.",1136073600,,5291,4.792535675082327

  Yes, it's true that there are many twists and turns in this 'plot', but all that really means, at least in this case, is that they can multiply a weak and thin screenplay.

S.F./Ranger/Typist: ""Ooh, I think I'll wear my maroon hat to fight today!""

And WHY are they wearing them in the JUNGLE!  Is that a poncho liner that Jackson is wearing like some sort of cape?!!  In the JUNGLE!?  With a Sweater!!!?  The Library of Freaking Congress could not hold a list that could detail all the blunders in this movie!

As a member of Special Forces I was truly insulted that the producers of this film didn't have enough respect for my job OR THEIRS to do even the teeniest weensiest bit of research that takes to make even a forgivably bad movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

688044,4,6303575617,"Twist-wise this is a heckuvagreat movie.  It's a steaming, down and dirty whodunnit-to-who under the guise of an army training exercise gone wrong.  A Special Force team goes into the jungles of Panama, under the supervision of Samuel L. Jackson (West,) but they don't all come out.  The onus of finding out what happened falls on Connie Nielsen (Osborne), but then Tim Daly (Styles) brings in John Travolta (Hardy) to take over the investigation.

It's not Travolta's best role, but he does a passable Hardy, the great inquisitor.  Connie Nielsen steals most of the movie, even though her accent grates on the nerves sometimes, but otherwise she's got what it takes.  Timothy Daly is good for most of the movie (until the end), and there just isn't enough Samuel L. Jackson to go around.

Poor Giovanni Ribisi - he must be really tired of being type-cast by now.  He plays the same role, once again, for the umpteenth time.

My problem with the movie is that a lot of the scenes are shot out of focus and in the dark - so it's hard to figure out who's doing what to whom most of the time. (My copy didn't have sub-titles, and the close-captioning was pathetic, so that didn't help much)

Any attempt to summarize the plot would contain spoilers, so I won't.  Spending a few hours on this 3.5 star movie, wouldn't be time wasted.

688045,3,6303575617,"Director John McTiernan's ""Basic"" highlights the team of John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson working together for the first time since their blockbuster ""Pulp Fiction.""  Initially it appears that they are polar opposites with Travolta playing a seemingly laid back, unconventional Drug Enforcement Agency agent and Jackson as a no nonsense, spit and polish disciplinarian Army Ranger sergeant.

Set in Panama, the film is all about appearances and reality as emotions shift back and forth as do opinions with the story being framed in a series of flashbacks representing various viewpoints.  Jackson has supposedly been killed by one or more of his men after a rain-soaked war drill in the jungle.  Travolta, who had served under Jackson as a Ranger, is called in to question the initial prime suspect in the sergeant's death.

Travolta immediately encounters resistance from provost marshal's office representative Connie Nielsen, who believes in following formal procedures, a technique anathema to the highly unconventional Travolta.  At one point when she is shouting at the suspect in an attempt to break him down, Travolta infuriates Nielsen by telling him that he will not insult his intelligence by engaging in a typical ""good cop-bad cop"" dialogue.

The investigators soon learn that there is a drug smuggling operation occurring on the base.  What makes matters even more ticklish is that the ringleader is none other than the officer in charge of the hospital, played by Harry Connick Jr., who also happens to be Nielsen's steady love interest.  When attention shifts to another suspect it is learned that he is the gay son of a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  ""There goes don't ask, don't tell,"" Travolta quips after the suspect reveals his sexual preference.

The contrast between the loose and freewheeling Travolta and the military formality of Jackson and Nielsen gives the story a lot of its dramatic punch.  Long before the surprise twist ending the audience is aware that the main story ploy relates to appearances and reality and to not believe what one hears before plenty of corroboration.",1109203200,3,2117,5.157894736842105

Being a Travolta and Jackson fan I expected a great deal, and I got it. I follow detective series all the time and I usually know whose guilty long before the end. This one kept me guessing who was a killer and who wasn't. When a group of soldiers is dropped in a jungle on a training mission only two get back alive. Travolta is asked to investigate by the Colonel running the base where the men were being trained. The investigation leads to killings and drugs. Be prepared to be thrilled and stumped. If you haven't figured it out by the end they will paint a clearer picture of what the unit Section 8 really is doing. One thing that would have helped me during my first viewing of the movie was something to indicate that maybe those supposedly killed might not be.

Both John Travolta and Samuel Jackson are slated for taking poor scripts, but I don't think this is as bad as say, SWAT. In fact I thouroughly enjoyed watching Basic, two big stars both with a certain presence to them certainly helped. I won't give away too much of the plot, its better if you go into this film without a clue, the twists are that much more credible.

688048,1,6303575617,"John Travolta as a soldier, cop, DEA agent or any sort of gun-weilding protagonist is simply not believable, therefore, the pretext for ""Basic"" is flawed before the story ever takes root.

Travolta reached his peak when he took top billing in ""Saturday Night Fever"", doing a great job of portraying a Brooklyn kid who is coming of age during the 70's disco era. But, outside of ""Pulp Fiction"" it's been all downhill after that, with a string of failures like ""Stayin' Alive"", ""Broken Arrow"", ""Battlefield Earth"", ""Swordfish"", and lest we forget, ""Look Who's Talking II"".

In ""The Thin Red Line"" Travolta played a U.S. Army General officer by method acting, evidently by imitating a talking plant. This huge miscasting no doubt greatly contributed to the failure of that film to garner any sort of approval by veiwing audiences.

""Basic"" is another such failure. Casting Travolta in a roles like the DEA agent he plays in this film is like a kiss of death for the entire project. For one thing, the idea that his character is a former Army Ranger is a hoot. Casting somebody like Pauly Shore or maybe even Martin Short as a a former Army Ranger would be more believable.

Very predictably, Travolta manages to stink up the whole story, which isn't all that great to begin with. Yet, with an extremely limited acting range, Travolta continues to crank out box office bomb after bomb after bomb.

On the other hand, if you believe that a well done thriller by definition has to play fair with its audience, you'll likely feel manipulated and, yes, cheated.
This is one of those films that are difficult to discuss without spoiling the plot.  Suffice it to say that I found the production values first rate, and the sound and action sequences generally well done.  I don't mind Travolta, like Connie Nielsen, and wasn't too put off by a fairly cliched performance by Samuel Jackson as the (usual) hard-bitten Sergeant.
However, the movie cannot stand up to close analysis of the plot and its various devices.  Sins against the viewer are committed by the screenwiter and director--the principle one being that characters who are shown to have certain knowledge at the end do not act consistently with that knowledge throughout.
That's all I'm going to say except that having the DVD will enable you to replay some of the scenes sufficiently to see the extent to which the viewer has been manipulated.

John Travolta is Tom Hardy, and ex-Army Ranger turned DEA agent cooling his heels in Panama while under investigation for taking a bribe. An old Army pal, the commanding officer of the local Ranger training unit, conscripts Hardy to interrogate a trainee that returned carrying a wounded comrade from a jungle exercise, during which the other four participants were killed, presumably by each other. Among the dead is Sgt. Nathan West (Samuel L. Jackson), a kick-butt and much hated instructor, who ostensibly arranges ""training accidents"" for chronic losers who don't make the Ranger grade and are too stupid to realize it. Hardy, a trained interrogator, is needed on the case because the local provost officer, Lt. Julia Osborne (Connie Nielsen), isn't up to the task, especially as pressure is expected from Washington since the wounded man is the son of a government big shot.
Much of the run time is devoted to flashbacks, in which the audience sees various versions of the story, as told to Hardy by the survivors, as to what happened out in the jungle. In the aggregate, all versions only muddy the issue. The confusion of it all is heightened by the fact that the apparent murders, starting with Sgt. West's, happen at night in a driving rain storm, and all the participants are decked out in camouflage uniforms and grease paint. The audience, or at least this viewer, never achieved certainty as to who was who and what was what. None of the supporting players outside of Hardy and Osborne established much in the way of screen identity.
And speaking of driving rain, Hardy and Osborne occasionally wander out into it, but they never seem to be even damp once they get back indoors. Even carrying a big umbrella and wearing rain gear, I'd come out of such a storm looking like a drowned dog. The water must have been the Hollywood, fast-drying type.
Travolta's Hardy character is appealing, and it's a shame there wasn't more chemistry between him and Nielsen's Osborne. I spent too much time trying to decide whether or not I should take the latter seriously and what sort of accent she was hoping to achieve. I settled on  ""not"" to the first question, and remained stumped on the second.

There's a major twist at the conclusion which makes things clear - well, only just, perhaps. But, by that time, I was so frustrated trying to cope with the wildly careening perspectives on reality that I didn't care much. I didn't even have the energy to wonder about the cause of wounded soldier Levi Kendall's (Giovanni Ribisi) sudden and dramatic death in his hospital bed, which went completely unexplained.

688123,2,6303575617,"Once again, John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are the central characters in another military action movie. The plot is as follows: a hard-time sargeant, played by Jackson, comes up with a live-fire drill in the forests of Panama, but the exercise goes terribly wrong; everyone but two of the army soldiers end dead, and the two remaining won't agree on what really happened during the drill. Hardy, played by Travolta, is the ex-army interrogator summoned by the commander of the barracks to solve the mistery.
OK, the premise is good. The film is told in flashbacks, the same scene repeated many times, different according to each and new version of the story, as they come to light. The acting is quite good, especially by Jackson (no surprise here). Direction is also OK, by John McTiernan (Die Hard). And the movie is quite enjoyable, at least until the final twenty minutes, when a series of endless and completely absurd, unbelievable plot twists (full of plot holes) ruin the entire film. If you want to have an idea of the absurdity of the plot, just access the IMDB page for ""Basic"" and its message board section.
Watching the credits, I realised the screenwriter, a certain fellow named James Vanderbilt, made his debut with ""Darkness Falls"", which I consider to be one of the Bottom-Five movies I've ever watched. ""Darkness Falls"" is ridiculous. The screenplay of ""Basic"" is almost as ridiculous. I really, really don't understand why a cast composed of such good and acclaimed actors say ""yes"" to such a poor writing.
After the movie ended, I was angry, I felt cheated and I promised to myself I will NEVER watch another movie that has a screenplay by Vanderbilt. I don't like to be treated like an idiot, and that's what this script did to me.

Yet it does work, much along the lines of other preposterous action plots Travolta has been involved with, such as ""Broken Arrow"" or even ""Phenomenon"". And as with both of these other previous outings, the intrepid John-Boy surrounds himself with an excellent supporting cast, which helps to frame the action and spin the yarn along toward its unlikely and unexpected conclusion.
Thus, Samuel L. Jackson plays the central figure in the unfolding drama, an unforgiving, unapproachable, and somewhat sadistic Drill instructor who takes the trainees out on a dangerous exercise in which all but two wind up dead. The two left are somehow involved in all that has transpired out in the jungle, and Travolta is called in to help sort it out for an old friend (Timothy Daly), who is now the Base Commander. With the aid of the scrumptious Connie Neilson, the chase for the truth is on. Yet while the viewer is taken on a whirlwind cascade of facts so contrived, confusing, and calculated that one wonders if there is a manufactured maelstrom machine operating here.

688156,3,6303575617,"""Basic"" is a relatively entertaining mystery movie that delights in pulling the rug out from under its audience at regular intervals.  This is one of those military thrillers in which a sadistic, hotheaded sergeant (Samuel L. Jackson), who is uniformly despised by the men in his squadron, dies under mysterious circumstances while leading a basic training exercise in Panama.  A DEA officer (John Travolta), whose own moral code seems to be in question what with rumors of drug dealings lurking in his background, is called in to investigate.
For long stretches of its running time, ""Basic"" feels like a puzzle in search of a key to its solution.  The attempt at a ""Roshomon""-like flashback structure - in which the same event is viewed through the conflicting testimonies of multiple eyewitnesses - often leads to more confusion than clarity, resulting in the audience scratching its head wondering just what is actually going on here.  One of the primary reasons for this air of incomprehensibility is the fact that the filmmakers don't do a sufficient job differentiating the minor characters from one another so that we can't always understand who is doing what to whom and why any of what we are seeing on screen really matters. However, the trick turnabout ending goes a long way towards clearing things up - or making them even more confusing, depending on how you look at it.  For that's just the kind of film ""Basic"" is; it exists entirely to deceive and trick the audience and make us thank it for the privilege of being bamboozled - and that it does reasonably well.  Actually, the key to enjoying a film like ""Basic"" is to go with the flow and not worry overmuch if every plot detail makes perfect sense when seen in the grand scheme of things.
""Basic"" is noteworthy mainly for the terrific, slightly over-the-top performance of Travolta, who seems to be having the time of his movie acting life playing this highly charismatic, no-nonsense, slightly seedy rogue investigator.  Travolta commands the screen in a way that few members of his acting generation are able to do these days.  He alone is reason enough to check out ""Basic.""",1072828800,,2146,4.876373626373627

688160,5,6303575617,"There is nothing basic about Basic.  I thought this movie was superb; maybe I'm easier to please than a lot of the people who criticize the script because I found this to be one of the most intelligent, mesmerizing, blow-your-mind movies I've ever seen.  It's a rare treat to find a movie that is not completely predictable these days, and Basic takes unpredictability and surprise to unheard of levels.  There was one small aspect of the saga I successfully predicted early on, but the rest of the twists and turns this movie takes had me doing mental gymnastics.  Every time you start to think you've seen at least a shadow of the light, this movie rips the rug back out from under you and plunges you into even darker depths of confusion and doubt.  Best of all, this elaborate plot actually holds together, which is really just amazing.  Basic is a movie that makes you think, and I have no problem admitting that I was often at a loss as to what was really going on; Basic did not insult my intelligence in any way shape or form; it challenged it constantly and delightfully humbled me in the process.
At the center of the story is a Special Forces training mission that goes horribly awry.  Only two of six soldiers make it out of the Panamanian jungle, one of whom is injured and the other of whom isn't talking.  The base commander Styles (Timothy Daly) calls in his old buddy Hardy (John Travolta) to interrogate the witness because he feels the job is over the head of Army investigator Osborne (Connie Nielsen).  Before the feds get involved, Styles wants to know why the unit leader Sgt. West (Samuel L. Jackson) and four soldiers are lying dead somewhere out in the jungle.  Hardy is a former Ranger who served under and hated West, but he is now an agent with the Drug Enforcement Agency.  Hardy gets the one soldier to tell his version of events, only to hear a much different story from the injured soldier when he wakes up in the hospital.  So begins a quest for the truth that has Hardy and Osborne running back and forth between witnesses, discovering unexpected aspects of the case such as the existence of drug-smuggling operations being carried out inside the base and hospital, and discovering that the big fish they are striving so hard to reel in is one big whopper indeed.
Do things become confusing?  That's affirmative, but I see this in a positive light.  This movie makes you stop and think, turning over what you have heard in your own mind not so much to predict the future as to merely stay caught up with the twists and turns you have just seen revealed before your very eyes.  In the final analysis, one or two little aspects of the presentation, which occur largely in the form of dream-like flashbacks, may have a weak leg to stand on but never come close to collapsing or falling over.  Some will probably be tempted to just throw their hands up in the air and give up trying to understand everything, but those who love a challenge, especially one presented in such a theatrical and awe-inspiring way, will find themselves energized and inspired to a degree few movies can hope to duplicate.  For my money, Basic is one of the most intelligent, suspenseful thrillers I've seen in a long time.",1070150400,2,3231,4.581597222222222

By their definition, thriller/mysteries are designed to keep you guessing throughout the tale, and a big part of the entertainment value is the process of determining the identity of the killer. This film indeed keeps the viewer guessing and continues to do so until the end. There are some of us who have that ability to watch any mystery film and deduce the culprit's identity within the first ten minutes of the story. (I'm not one of them) But I would bet anyone my last dollar to figure out this film's ending, the final twist is exceptionally clever and surprising.
It was also a pleasure to see Travolta and Jackson together on the screen again. After seeing this picture, I was reminded of that intense charisma and power these two actor's command on screen; both have that undeniable star quality that shines in every project they do.

Travolta plays the role of DEA agent (Hardy) who is assigned to investigate the disappearance of U.S Army drill instructor (Nathan West) played by Jackson ,And also uncover the mysterious circumstances surrounding  the finding of only two survivors from the group that were accompanying West during their training in the jungles of Panama ,He teams with officer (Osborne) played by Connie Nielsen ,And what first seems to be an ordinary military investigation leads to a very astonishing truth .
Basic actually is a good thriller ,It captures the viewer's attention slowly and gradually ,That is helped by specific use elements both technically and plotting ,The pouring rain during the movie events helped to raise the attention level by casting a dark atmosphere ,There is also some plot devices thrown here and there to help the forming of the movie's conclusion ,Some or many viewers complained about some thing strange which is the movie was full of twists ,In close inspection for this complaint you can't help but admire the script written by James Vinderbilt ,It may seems a little bit complicated and hard to follow when the two survivors begin to tell what's happened out there in the jungle with every one of them telling completely different story ,But this is not the vital element here and soon many other truths are revealed which leads us to the conclusion which I can't see anything wrong with ,It's just seems unpredictable at all and this may bothers some people .
Director John John McTiernan delivered a good thriller which isn't traditional or cheap looking in any way ,The events was moving quickly and he succeeded in casting both Travolta and Jackson for the leading roles ,Actually Travolta made one of his most strong performance in the recent years ,Playing it simple and straight ,He really captured the frame while he is there ,But that unfortunately wasn't enough ,I am talking here about the movie not about Travolta ,It just needed more accurate plotting which isn't focused on the conclusion because it's not completely satisfying when you feel at the end that the whole plot is put there to lead to the finale ,Although it was brilliant as I noted before but I wished that the movie was more deep ,I really felt hungry for more after the credit were rolling .",1069632000,,2762,4.889125799573561

688184,3,6303575617,"Basic is a good concept of a movie.  The 100 minutes you get are entertaining and suspenseful.  The cast is excellent- John Travolta, Samuel L Jackson, Connie Neilson, Giovanni Ribisi, and other very recognizable names make this an A list group of actors.  Plus, the execution of the storyline is superb and holds the interest of the viewer well.
The storyline is rather simple.  On a routine training mission, a group of rangers encounter some problems and some of them get killed, including their leader, West (Jackson).  Travolta, a former ranger and current DEA agent, is brought in because it is assumed he will get more answers than Neilson.  There are two survivors of the incident, who of course, give completely differing versions of the events.  This film has been compared to the Kurasawa classic Rashomon because of the differing versions of the events not lining up but it seems more Usual Suspects to me.  We have just a couple of eyewitnesses who are telling us some truth and some lies when it will serve them well.  Just about all the soldiers present are blamed at some point in the story for the death of West.
Fine and good, but Basic is way too concerned with messing with your mind and twisting the story beyond comprehension.  Not long into the movie, what seemed relevent is no longer as important, and then another twist changes our previous perceptions, until finally, at the end, we are given the whole truth, that nothing we have seen really matters and that it was all a lie.
This would be ok, if the movie gave us some clues to figure out what was going on.  Movies I have loved recently, like Identity or the Sixth Sense had massive twist endings as well, but they played fair throughout the course of the film.  When you went through the movie a second time, you could see where the clues were given.  The twist in this film is so far out there, it is impossible, and I call that not good storytelling, rather not fair and uninteresting.  In that way, it also parallels the Usual Suspects, because that movie also was practically impossible to figure out, but the ending of that film was also more interesting.  The ending of Basic is difficult to even care about.
Honestly, the film was well made, not dull at all, and the characters were interesting.  But the movie tries too hard to lead us astray, and as a result, we are left out in left field, with no chance to care about anything that happens at the end.",1069113600,,2444,4.571100917431193
688185,2,6303575617,"This 2003 film is supposed to be a military thriller.  But in order to be a thriller the plot has to make at least a little sense.  This does not happen in ""Basic"".  Sure, there's some good photography and a pretty good cast.  And sure, the military situation in Panama is unique and tied up with drug trafficking and a jungle setting.  But the plot is ridiculous.
John Travolta is the star.  He's cast as a former ranger who now works for the DEA.  We learn that Samuel L. Jackson, cast as a hard driving sergeant has supposedly been murdered in the jungle, presumably by his own men.  Connie Neilson is cast as the military officer who is supposed to question the suspects.  She's inept at a her job.  That's why they bring in John Travolta.  He's macho and disrespectful and naturally there is a romantic connection.
Everyone who is questioned about the murder gives a different story and the audience sees each of these stories in flashbacks.  It's hard to figure out what is real and what is unreal.  Did I say ""hard to figure out""?  I should have said ""impossible"".  That's because the film writer plays a trick on the audience and the film winds up in a way that is a complete turnaround from what was being presented.  The whole story is implausible and silly.

The story gets twisted so much, and flashbacks are keeping you more wondering then boring.

688190,2,6303575617,"Yes, Sam Jackson and John Travolta co-star in the same movie again after their career-making turns in ""Pulp Fiction"" made 8 years before.  And yes, they share some of the screen time, so don't worry the film might be something like ""Heat"" (in which Al and Bob didn't seem to have shared the same space even if they did).  But, I tell you, in this film ""Basic"" they are no Jules and Vincent hotly discussiing the merit of hambergers.  I mean there is nothing remarkable about their 'co-starring.'
The film is like ""Courage Under Fire"" in Panama with the slight tinge of ""Rashomon.""  John Travolta is, as you expect, ex-ranger and DEA agent with shady past.  He is called in to assist Connie Nielsen's official investigator to seek what really happened deep in the jungle of Panama, where the military troops were training under Sgt. Samuel L Jackson, stern and foul-mouthed chief.  8 members went into the forest during hurricane, and only three came back, one dead, one wounded, and one whose mouth is tightly shut.  So what happened?
But what happened?  I am still confused, because the story is given so many twists and turns that I couldn't follow it.  The problem is, each flashback shot is too dark; each character is, except for Sam Jackson, very weak and one-dimentional; and most importantly, no version of 'truth' is interesting at all -- interesting in whatever meaning you might take.  You see TRUTH Version A, and then Version B; none of them is intriguing as the basis of thriller, and then comes Version C and D and ... finally, I lost count.  It is true that the ending is surprising (or meant to be so), but, frankly, it was jaw-droppingly incredible.
In short, ""Basic"" is trying to be too smart, and consequently it sacrifices a group of very talented actors.  I didn't notice until much later that people like Taye Diggs or Giovanni Ribisi are included in the cast, perhaps because of poor lighting and his way of speech.  Forgive me for saying so, but I really like these actors, and cannot overlook these outrageous use of them.
I see nothing wrong with Travolta's acting, but compared with Sam Jackson's acting as charismatic as ever, he seems to be in need of a bit of more polishing up.  And as to Connie Nielsen, all I can say is she is more convincing than her turn as FBI investigator in ""Hunted,"" but her haircut is as strange as Travolta's one in ""Swordfish.""
If it had been made with lesser known people, I would have given more stars to ""Basic.""  As it is (and its director being John 'Die Hard' McTiernan), it remains there.  If you get tired of following the story, try to spot John Travolta's elder sister Margaret as nurse.  That may help you to keep interested.",1064361600,2,2696,4.618448637316562

Only two people survive the training mission, so Travolta is asked to come in and get to the bottom of the murder and get the stories straight.
Sometimes you can get a little annoyed watching some of the same things over and over again, and possibly think to yourself, ""can we just get to the end of this, please?""

What this movie really has going for it is the atmosphere. The scenes of the squad in the hurricane (which, not to give anything away, is the plot of the movie all told in flashback) is very atmopheric, dreadful and appropriately mysterious. We are basically given a who-dunnit mystery told through the mouths of two survivors, each contradicting one another. Without giving much else away, the ending really did have me surprised though a little gypped.
What went wrong? Ambiguous information (which serves as a filler to the plot) and poor editing.  It tries to up the ante with the plot twists over and over and over and over again but after about the 10th twist in the plot, it gets weary.
The story itself is quite alright but shouldn't have tried so hard to make the viewer feel like it had outsmarted them -- anyone can make a plot with an unexpected ending but it takes some panache to tie it all together, and have it flow smoothly. Basic seems very choppy.

The movie is filmed brilliantly with just the right amount of darkness on the scenes to add that feeling that something is being hidden from you. And it is.
This films main problem lies in the fact that you are lead into a dazzling investigation about the deaths of several soldiers on a training mission. You hear sides, you form ideas, and then you realize that none of that even matters. It is that element alone that takes away heavily from this movie. As you travel through this deep and dark military atmosphere in your mind you go through so many twists that you are anticipating this great slam bang ending. It is as that point when you recieve a soft curb in the road that gradually tells you that nothing you've learned on this trip has any bearing on the outcome of the film, and you come face to face with something you saw coming the whole time.
I am not saying that this movie completely destroys itself in it's final moments.

Basic will have you asking yourself questions about why this happened or was that possible for days after watching the movie.  The ending is perfect for the movie.  I can almost guarantee that you will not see it coming.
  John Travolta gives an excellent performance as Tom Hardy, DEA agent and ex-Army interrogator brought in to find out what happened during the mission.  You can tell just by looking that he enjoyed making this movie.  Connie Nielsen plays Julie Osborne, Hardy's parnter during the investigation.  She is very good as the story unfolds before us.  Samuel L. Jackson is also good as Sergeant Nathan West, the sadistic leader of the Rangers on the mission.  The movie also stars Tim Daly, Taye Diggs, Brian Van Holt, and Harry Connick JR all who give very good performances.  The DVD offers widescreen presentation, trailers from several movies including Basic, and two featurettes that shine some light on the twists and turns of the plot.  This is a great military thriller that will keep you riveted throughout the movie.  The ending has to be seen, so I will not tell anything about it.  Check out Basic for a great ride of a movie!",1060992000,3,1808,4.703821656050955

688230,4,6303575617,"I almost always watch a film twice, even if I have to wait for it to come out on video or DVD for the second viewing.  I can distinctly remembering being aware that I enjoyed watching ""It's a Wonderful Life"" more the second time around with all the ways that Frank Capra set up the nightmare sequence at the end.  Since then I have enjoyed watching films a second time to appreciate how stories and surprises are set up.  After watching ""Basic"" I was really looking forward to a second viewing to appreciate how this one set off the dramatic payoffs at the end.  Having listened to John McTiernan and James Vanderbilt talking about the directing and writing of ""Basic"" I wanted to really pay attention to how they set me up, because I never saw the end of this one coming.  But once I finished watching the film a second time I realized something rather depressing: I never had a chance.  On the one hand I like the fact I did not see the ending of this one coming; but while there are hints that point to the resolution there is only the empty feeling of being tricked, not the joy of having been played.
""Basic"" is a military murder mystery involving a number of deaths in a Rangers training exercise in the rain soaked jungles of Panama.  Samuel L. Jackson plays the drill sergeant from hell and John Travolta is the former army officer called in to investigate by an old buddy.  The film has been compared to both ""Memento"" and ""Rashomon,"" and both comparisons are faulty.  ""Memento"" was brilliantly constructed and the audience understood exactly how it was being played.  In ""Basic"" you are fooled, not because you have been tricked, but rather because you have been lied to.  ""Rashomon"" had different characters telling their own decidedly different version of the same event, which is certainly a key part of ""Basic,"" and in both films you do get the truth at the end.  But when you watch ""Rashomon"" a second time you understand why each character tells the story that they tell; the ""lies"" or ""self-deceptions"" make sense in that they present the teller in the best light.  But in ""Basic"" the lies are intended primarily to confuse the audience.  Which they do.  All we can assume is that each telling of the tale is closer to the truth, but even that knowledge does us no practical good.
This is disappointing because we are talking a movie directed by McTiernan and starring Travolta and Jackson and we would expect something better.  However, after listening to the various interviews on the DVD I can see what happened.  McTiernan and Travolta were impressed with Vanderbilt's script, but the director objected to the fate of Jackson's character and Travolta was not happy with what happened to his own character.  Consequently, the second half of the script was rewritten to make everybody happy.  However, when you are talking about a carefully constructed murder mystery, these sorts of revisions clearly turned what might have been a delicate mechanism into a cinematic bulldozer.
Maybe you will not be offended by the way it all works out.  ""Basic"" is certainly compelling, not only in the way Travolta's character of Tom Hardy interrogates various witnesses to what happened out in the jungles of Panama, but also the way he banters with Captain Osborne (Connie Nielsen), the young officer who has the misfortune of being the closest thing the base has to an investigative officer.  The cast is excellent, with Giovanni Ribisi, Taye Diggs, Brian Van Holt, Tim Daly, and Harry Connick, Jr. running around tangling with Travolta and Jackson.  To be fair, I did not really understand how badly I had been had until I watched the film a second time, but ""Basic"" should have been the real thing and it is not.",1059955200,5,3723,4.712962962962963

John Travolta is solid as an ex-Army ranger called in to interrogate surviving rangers of an ill-fated training exercise and find out what happened to the legendary Sgt. West (Samuel L. Jackson; excellent as always).  Travolta is joined by Connie Nielsen to help with the interrogation, but as the film gets underway and the plot thickens, the viewer is left in they're seat wondering just what is going on.  All that aside, Basic is a fine film on it's own right, but it had so much potential that has been laid to waste.

And again, and again. But the turns are not so unbelievable that you're like ""yeah, right."" They make sense. I've seen flicks with surprise twists where it appears they made the twist just to say that it had a twist, not that it served any purpose.

688264,2,6303575617,"A Film by John McTiernan
I didn't like it.  I'll make that clear from the start.  I thought the movie had some potential and had its moments, but McTiernan kept throwing huge twists and swerves at us and ultimately the movie threw one too many twists and just killed the whole thing.
The movie opens with some horrible narration by Connie Nielson, but we move into a Ranger training exercise.  West (Samuel L Jackson) is the training leader and he takes his men out on a live fire exercise.  The scene shifts to a chopper coming in and we learn that it has been 6 hours since the men were supposed to check in.  Nobody has.  The soldiers in the helicopter see flashes of gunfire and realize that the surviving men are firing on each other.  Two men are rescued, one goes to the hospital and other is taken in for questioning.  The non-injured soldier is interrogated by Obsorne (Connie Nielson).  He demands to talk to a Ranger and makes a mark on the bottom of a sheet of paper that seems to spook the base commander.  The base commander calls in a disgraced former Ranger/DEA agent (who is currently under suspicion of bribery, but is an old friend, Hardy (John Travolta).
Hardy interviews/interrogates both surviving Rangers and he gets different stories, so he keeps on going back and forth between the two of them and the stories keep changing, as if they are adding on to each other and building and adapting the stories for Hardy as he brings new information to each Ranger.  Thus far, the story is told in a similar fashion to Courage Under Fire (a superior movie to this one).  The problem is that Basic keeps throwing twists and turns until it no longer makes much sense nor could I keep caring when something changed again.  By the time the last twist is thrown as the very end, and I realized that this invalidated the entire movie, I also realized that this last twist killed quite a bit of the internal consistency (whatever was left) that the movie actually had.  I'm not going to give spoilers for the film, in case anyone does want to see it, but if you think back on the movie (after watching it), one or two comments make more sense and the rest make a whole lot less sense.
The bottom line is that this movie stinks and was a disappointment (even going in with low expectations).  Sam Jackson gives another scene stealing performance, but it is completely wasted.  Connie Nielson was flat and uninteresting, and Travolta was serviceable (no more than that).  Basic tries to do too much with too little and turns out to be an utter waste of film.",1059436800,2,2565,4.517316017316017
688265,3,6303575617,"You have to respect director John McTiernan for what he is attempting with Basic: The Thinking Man's Action Film. While at its core, Basic is your run-of-the-mill murder mystery interlaced with testosterone moments of flying bullets and angry stares, in the end the final product becomes bogged down in its own cleverly laid sandtraps. The screenplay, while sharply written with tight dialogue still fails to deliver the knockout punch. The performances are adequate, with Giovanni Ribisi being the lone sell-out in the cast. While attempting to appear sinister, amoral and just plain confused, he comes off as a pure hack; all menacing sidelong glances, guttural ""I hate Daddy"" speeches while sputtering riddle after incoherent riddle. John Travolta imbues Tom Hardy with the same boyish charm and ornery impetus that had littered every character he has every played, and Sam Jackson is merely adequate. Two surprise performances however come in the form of Tim Daly (Wings) and Harry Connick Jr. Not a terrible effort, but Basic could have been better.",1059004800,,1054,5.242603550295858

She's quite believeable in her role as an Army captain.  However, like many military films, this one takes some great liberties with what does and doesn't happen in the military, but it's fiction, so it's excusable in its context.",1058745600,2,531,4.75
688267,4,6303575617,"Taken as a whole, this movie is a pretty good one, with plenty of plot twists and turns that aren't too transparent or predictable; for the better part it will keep you guessing as to who the real killer or killers are.  While I must admit that I've never really been a big John Travolta fan, I would have to say that his performance in the movie was better than his norm.  Samuel L. Jackson's performance is, albeit brief, poignant and in good keeping with his usual high standard of performance.  Connie Nielsen does a wonderful job of playing a Provost Marshall.  With actors of such high caliber and a high profile director like John McTiernan, whose work includes ""Die Hard"", ""Predator"", ""The Hunt for Red October"" and other such high profile films; this movie does move along at a high pace and it is a well told story.
Conceptually this movie is highly plausible, the plot is well written, the actor's performances are well done and the soundtrack is well suited to the movie.  I do have one major problem with this film though.  Without searching the credits, I'm going to have to make one of two assumptions about whether or not the filmmakers hired a technical consultant with knowledge about the United States Army or not.  I'm guessing here that they didn't hire one because if they did, they wouldn't have had a scene where Samuel L. Jackson is wearing BDU's (Battle Dress Uniform), yelling and screaming at his soldiers, with them calling him Sergeant and then you look at his collar and he's wearing the rank of a Specialist, which is a junior enlisted member, ""below"" the rank of Sergeant.  Later of course, he's wearing the stripes of a Master Sergeant which would be in accordance with how he was being addressed.  Then there is the issue of a Ranger squad having a female as a member.  While the films producers addressed this, quite briefly, in one of the special features, where they basically said that they knew she didn't belong, but they threw her in the bargain anyway.  These two issues and the ""soldiers"" referring to their ruck sacks as packs, instead of ""ruck,"" blew a lot of this films credibility with me, a soldier with several years in the Army.
The premise:
Samuel L. Jackson plays a Ranger Master Sergeant, in Panama, prior to our pulling out that country, and he's in charge of training what looks like a platoon of Rangers in jungle warfare.  As the movies main title rolls, we see Jackson and a squad of his, in a Huey (an aircraft long since relegated to the National Guard), flying over the canal, preparing to drop in and run an exercise, all the while, a hurricane is raging around them.  The scene cuts to another helicopter searching for the Ranger squad which is well over due for their check in and then they spot one Ranger carrying another and being shot at by another of the Rangers.  Here is where the murder/mystery kicks in and the Colonel, played by Tim Daly, calls in John Travolta to interrogate the witnesses to determine what happened out there in the field.
What follows from this point is an intriguing movie that gets rather fascinating as the plot carries forward and you're trying to figure out ""whodunit.""  Outside of the ""annoyances"" of improper Army uniforms, terminology and tactics, this movie is good film to watch.  {ssintrepid}

It had a well known director with a well deserved cast and a story with multiple plot twists that involved deception, murder, corruption, and a hint of romance. So what went wrong? What really went wrong with it was that the ending wasn't worth all the confusing plot twists that happened during the film. The ending wasn't worth all the figuring out I tried to do. And I really wasn't all that shocked or surprised with the ending. With films like these, you kinda have to expect a ending like the ending of Basic. I was never really interested enough in the film to really care about how it ended. The performances were great, the chemistry between Travolta and Nielsen was definitely there, and McTiernan did a fine job on the direction, but I really think this film failed at producing an interesting enough story to really care about the plot twists and its ending.",1058227200,,922,4.593939393939394

688270,4,6303575617,"I'm a big Travolta fan and I like seeing him step out of the box of his previous typical roles but this type of character seems to be becoming more of his typical role these days.  Unpredictable.  Headed up by an all star cast of Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Taye Diggs, Tim Daly and Giovanni Ribisi, Basic is full of action and twists and turns.
It gets a little hard to follow at times but is generally good.  My big time pet peeve is Connie Nielson's acting.  Her thick southern accent which was very prevalent in the beginning of the film seems to disappear much of the time and then she remembers ""oh, I'm supposed to be southern!""  If you're being paid to act as a certain character, I'm real big on staying in character.  Ribisi played his character really well but I'd give anything for him to have used another dialect.  I can't even beging to explain how annoying it was, so much so that for me, the dialect detracted from the brilliance he was trying to bring across.  Another peeve is the cinematography can be annoying.  The rain in the beginning shots is the most horribly computer generated rain I've seen in years.  In the DVD extras it shows one scene where Sam Jackson is ragging on a soldier and it was a brightly lit set...on film it's raining and just done badly.  So if you're not nit picky, you probably won't notice or care.

The mere fact that it can't be pidgeonholed into a movie ""catagory"" or ""genre"" is the genius behind the direction, and I have to say probably one of John McTiernan's better movies to date. I'm not going to give anything away, except to say, this is a real potboiler, a whodunnit, and a dark sided movie all rolled into one. You will be compelled and find yourself guessing throughout the multiple twists, turns, and double backs that seem to be endlessly thrown into the mix.

688325,4,6303575617,"I went to see this movie since I enjoy any movie featuring John Travolta and was expecting a regular action movie - I was quite overwhelmed. This is a fast pace, (mostly) intelligent movie, which moves along different lines then those you are used to. The film's ending is yet to be discussed and I can only say that my understanding of the film's events was totally changed at the last 5 minutes.  I am not sure this ending was truly necessary - for me it was only a gimmick and the whole logic and understanding of the film was totally shattered.
The movie starts with a great scene of a military helicopter making its way through a stormy rain with the knowledge of a great storm breaking in.  The helicopter holds a team of seven men and one woman, headed by the great Samuel Jackson playing the tough Sgt. West. You cannot but feel pity for this wet group of people wondering what does the near future hold for them.
The next scene is filmed 17 hours later when something is understood to have gone wrong with the team. The search team arrives in time to catch three men involved in a gun fight. One man dies, one man is wounded and the surviving soldier is not ready to talk. Hence - enter John Travolta, a former army interrogator, asked to find out what has happened. Travolta arrives after the regular interrogator (Connie Nielsen) is unable to get any information from the survivors. Together with Travolta they start a search for the truth of what happened, a search that becomes harder with every new piece of evidence.
This is not a movie that ""goes home with you"" or that gives you a new understanding of life, but is very entertaining and there is no dull moment.

688354,2,6303575617,"""Basic"" features one of the great fakeout performances of all time from John Travolta, though it's more deplorable than admirable. If the movie is to be believed, then only the final five minutes feature Travolta's character, DEA agent Tom Hardy, speaking words that could not be considered a con job. Were ""Basic"" a David Mamet picture, well now. But it's a military movie about a combat accident, then murder, then drugs, then...nothing. There has to be easier ways to ferret out crooked officers than this.

 Truth be told, the journey in ""Basic,"" directed by John McTiernan, is pretty entertaining. A ""training"" exercise in the Panamanian jungle goes awry when a soldier (Who? How? When?) murders the sadistic drill instructor, Sgt. West (Samuel L. Jackson). Out of eight soldiers, two survive, neither is talking, and the commanding officer in Panama (Timothy Daly) has an impending image problem. Hardy is a friend called in to assist the on-base investigator (Connie Nielsen) with the predictable butt of heads ensuing.
 A leaner, meaner Travolta has his moments, especially with the first uncooperative solider (Brian Van Holt). The other, wounded soldier is played by Giovanni Ribisi as a mannered, slightly deranged gay man forced to join the military by his general father. Uh huh.
 Naturally, the soldiers have alternate stories that implicate one another. Naturally, there's another layer below those stories. And another. And another.  The final layer reveals there were no layers; it's like icing, suspended in air, over a nonexistent cake. You can see how this might not be pleasing.
 Movies can be, and often should be, clever. Every so often, movies can even fib a little -- flashbacks, for example, are seen in the eye of beholder, and are not necessarily the actual truth. ""Basic"" goes much further into this territory, toward blatant abuse of the audience's trust. Consider a scene where Hardy discovers that one soldier has been using the name of another; the camera zooms in on Hardy, then cuts to several scenes we've already seen in the movie, only with a different soldier in the role of the previous soldier. The way this scene is cut, it's clear these flashbacks are meant to occur in Hardy's mind; thus, he would seem to be putting together the pieces as we are.
 But later, ""Basic"" reveals Hardy not only had this information, but concealed it. How to explain the previous scene? There is no explanation, beyond the screenwriter, James Vanderbilt, wanting to make the viewer feel like a fool. His clear obsession with a trick ending throws a javelin through the heart of the film.
 Judging by the A-list supporting cast -- Jackson, Nielsen, Taye Diggs, Ribisi, Roselyn Sanchez, in a nice turn as a twisted, goofy female grunt  -- ""Basic"" had some heft behind it. What a bitter shame it amounted to nothing.",1050537600,25,2836,4.978858350951374
688355,4,6303575617,"I will confess right now: the only reason I went to see this movie was because of Giovanni Ribisi as Kendall. I didn't really like John Travolta and I cannot stand Samuel L. Jackson, but my faith in my Gio led me into the theatre with my mother anyways. Well, simply put, it renewed my faith in watching movies just for the actors!
I'm an action chick; anything with explosions, guns, and a hot guy or two will make me happy, and this one had it pretty much down. The first thing I noticed was that Giovanni Ribisi was hardly in the movie, but that was okay, because my faith in John Travolta had been restored.
It has a couple too many twists, but it rocked. I'd give it 5 stars if it hadn't been so damn confusing throughout the entire thing, and if they'd gotten me to like Samuel L. Jackson (I don't think that's possible though).
They also could have given Giovanni a little more screen time! ;-)",1050019200,,901,4.305882352941176
688356,4,6303575617,"Basic is anything but that - it proves to be the very antithesis of its title with its bizarre and constantly twisting and changing storyline. I believe Newton once said: With every cause, there comes an equal or greater effect. Well, while watching this movie you're constantly refiguring the outcomes when the variables continue to change - so much so that it almost makes you dizzy! Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are dead on as Army Rangers - the supporting cast is superb as well. I was pleasantly surprised by the cleverness of the plot and the good acting.
If you mix Black Hawk Down with The Usual Suspects you come out with Basic. Worth a look-see for all military buffs - just be prepared to pay VERY close attention to detail. One of the best movies I've seen in a while. Enjoy.",1049673600,6,789,4.524475524475524
688357,4,6303575617,"And so does Samuel L. Jackson. It's a fairly good movie, about Samuel L. Jackson's character missing in combat. Kinda like the General's Daughter in the sense that they get answers from witnesses and even killers. The major difference, Tom Hardy(John Travolta) is actually a suspect, compared to his character in the General's Daughter. I kinda liked the other movie better, but this is still good!! Two thumbs up!!!!",1049500800,,417,5.057971014492754
688358,3,6303575617,"John McTiernans Basic is very loud: 80% of the dialogue is shouted; a hurricane is blowing during most of the movie and the lighting and set dcor screams Army camouflage at you relentlessly.
But I suppose if you were going to cast any two actors to scream and yell their heads off during an entire film, no two actors could do that better than John Travolta (looking slim and trim) and Samuel L. Jackson.
The plot is intriguing for about 60% of this film until the incomprehensible twists and turns and twists and turns again start to make it seem like a poor mans version of The Usual Suspect.
Travolta and Jacksons charisma makes up for the lack of a coherent screenplay for a while but even they are not able to make this thing work 100%.
Chalk Basic up to a good try but no cigar, guys.",1049155200,5,790,4.344594594594595
688359,5,6303575617,"Best movie I've seen in the first quarter of 2003.  This movie twists and turns like no other.  If your a fan of movies like The Usual Suspects, you'll love Basic.  I'll definately be adding this to my DVD collection when its released.  I highly reccomend coughing up the[money] to see this film in the theaters, its worth it.",1048982400,2,326,4.47457627118644
688360,5,6303575617,This is a movie that requires patience and attention.  It twists back on itself much like memento or the usual suspects.  The plot is self-explanitory but the resulution is complex.  This was a great role fo travolta.  If you liked the complexity of the Usual Suspects you will love this movie.,1048982400,2,294,4.705882352941177
688361,3,6303575617,"Well, i have already lose my hopes of watching John Travolta in a big hit again but this movie is okay.
 The story is about John Travolta, who investigates the disappearance of a legendary Army drill sergeant (Samuel L. Jackson) and a squad of his cadets after a training exercise in Panama.
 You will think ''I have already seen that in another movie before''. It tries to twist and turns everytime, and it kind of works. the thriller is not that intense but its worthy anyway!",1048982400,2,478,4.546511627906977
688362,5,6303575617,"This movie sets up in the beginning like your typical army action flick that is heavy on violence but light on plot lines or character development.  Surprisingly the opposite turned out to be the case.  If you like to be surprised a la Costners' No Way Out, then you will really like this movie and the stories within stories.  This movie could easily be the surprise of the winter season.",1048982400,3,389,4.5285714285714285

I just don't like movies where you feel you need to take notes or every ten minutes you are going ""whaaa?"".  It was well done, but like I said just too much work.",1525824000,,335,3.8823529411764706
7851144,5,6303575617,"The ending is a kick in the brain, almost literally.  I almost needed to take notes to figure out what was really going on, probably should have, but it didn't matter anyway after seeing the ending.  Travolta and Jackson are a pair ... again ... same chemistry that made Pulp Fiction.  The acting is excellent, the story takes many twists trying to figure out 'who done it'.  Very entertaining.",1525737600,,394,4.666666666666667
