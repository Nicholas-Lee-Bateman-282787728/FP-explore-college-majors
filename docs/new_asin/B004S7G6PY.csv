4462171,5,B004S7G6PY,"I had always wondered what actually made conditions ripe for the ""Dust Bowl"".

4462174,5,B004S7G6PY,"This is an excellent look at the cause and results of the dust bowl era that mainly affected Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.  The Homestead Act sent settlers to these areas to farm.  Native grasses were plowed under to plant wheat.  Drought came and the dust storms caused incredible havoc to the land.  Great interviews with survivors of that time.  Disturbing images of men clubbing jack rabbits to death.  Overall a very complete and fascinating documentary.",1360022400,,479,5.076923076923077

4462177,5,B004S7G6PY,For the first time I finally realized what it must've been like to be in an actual dust storm.  The creators of this documentary actually engineered a dust storm.  Very eye-opening.  I used it in my class.,1353801600,,205,4.486486486486487
4462178,5,B004S7G6PY,"The History Channel's Black Blizzard is about the Dust Bowl where soil blew across the Plains and even to the East Coast on Sunday April 14, 1935 otherwise known as Black Sunday. The story of the Dust Bowl is about the Plains during the Great Depression. The survivors recall the black blizzards and the illnesses such as dust pneumonia which can be fatal for children. The real survivors are here. Also there is author Tim Egan, The Worst Bad Time, about the Dust Bowl.

The History Channel has scientists recreate the experiences that happened in dust bowl in a replica town in an isolated location. We haven't had a dust bowl or black blizzard in decades thanks to soil conservation established to prevent more dust bowls. There are dust bowls in Southeast Asia where the same conditions have allowed dust bowls to flourish. The dust bowls have occurred since then but nothing like the perfect storm in the 1930s in the Plains where the dust and the Great Depression were dual disasters.",1331596800,2,990,4.755813953488372

8439545,2,B004S7G6PY,Much of the film centers around engineering efforts to recreate dust bowl-like conditions instead of presenting documents of the actual dust bowl as it happened. I found this boring. Maybe you won't.,1472774400,,199,5.25

8439547,5,B004S7G6PY,"Need to do something a little different in the classroom?  Students worried when the wind kicks up?  ""Black Blizzard"" is a perfect curriculum enhancer - students can even take ""old school"" notes - Cornell notes and use them for a Socratic Seminar later.  Perfect opportunity to strengthen intellectual skills that could easily be used on an AP exam or even with critical thinking activities - Hmmm...  What a great attention getter!  5 stars:)",1456531200,3,443,5.013698630136986
