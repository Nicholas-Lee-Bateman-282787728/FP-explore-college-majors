2045948,5,B0001Z3I0S,"A MUST SEE TV show! I am so glad this was released in DVD format and I hope they release all the upcoming seasons as well. ""Just Shoot Me"" is a show filled with comedy and drama surrounding a fashion magazine. The characters are on point and no other actors would have been better.
Favorite Line in this MUST HAVE dvd:
Nina: We take inner city kids and let them be doormen for the rich.
Elliot: How does that help?
Nina: You know, if you have packages and stuff.
Hillarious! If you're a fan this is a MUST HAVE, if you're a WB late night re-run watcher, purchase this now! The special features are also wonderful, including crew commentaries and an interview segment featuring scenes from the original pilot episode.
You will not regret it, it is very worth it!",1088985600,5,761,4.442857142857143
2045949,4,B0001Z3I0S,"I have so far never bought any sitcom TV Series. This was my first. I wander whether ""Just Shoot Me!: Seasons One & Two"" would be a great edition to be part of my TV Series shelve collection. And when it arrived... I'm glad I bought this!
Meet Maya Gallow (Laura San Giacomo) - sarcastic writer for fashion magazine Blush! own by his father - Jack Gallow (George Segal - his funniest roles ever). A day in the fashion magazine publishing company adds 3 other actors that brings the TV Series to life (Enrico Colantoni, Wendie Malick & David Spade) - with laughter that never stops and the value of able to laugh again & again without tiring.
With added guest stars like Kristana Loken (from Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines fame), Jay Leno, Crystal Bernard, Carmen Elektra and more, plus a featurette and commentaries on selected episodes, you can't go wrong with this 31 episodes DVD Set at all!
Overall, this is a funny sitcome TV Series that I will look forward for the coming seasons. Please, please, please release them!",1088035200,13,1027,4.617486338797814
2045950,5,B0001Z3I0S,"Nina is my favorite character on the show. Samples of Nina's wisdom that will give you a belly-ache laughing:
NINA: One of the people I've always admired is Gore Vidal.
MAYA: Really? Gore Vidal?
NINA: Oh, did I say Gore Vidal? I meant Vidal Sassoon.
(Nina to Maya) ""It's your fault! You made me donate my zebra-skin jacket! I had it especially made for Earth Day!""
(Reacting to a sad event) ""I would cry if I weren't high on Prozac.""

2045951,5,B0001Z3I0S,"I love Just Shoot Me, it was one of the better sitcoms out there. And I'm happy it is on dvd, however towards the last few seasons the show got really stupid. Why the writers decided to focus on Kevin was beyond me. That character ruined the show and had no bearing to the cast whatsoever. But when the show was funny, it was funny! David Spade was the best, and the rest of the cast were so funny. Lots of great episodes. I'm looking forward to getting my dvd in the mail.",1087689600,3,473,4.096774193548387

I have every ep on tape but the contrast on the DVD will be better! also one of my tapes looks worn out. I cant wait for the other seasons to come out. I like seasons 1 and 2 but seasons 3,4,and 6 are my favorites cause thats when it focuses on Finch played by the very funny and talented David Spade! I think the show is the funniest when it focuses on him! They are all great but I think david is the best one! Ill definitely be one of the first to buy this on the first day!!!!",1081036800,7,611,3.975609756097561

Not something he shows in most other parts he plays. Wendie Malick is beautiful and funny. This woman never ages.  Everyone is great in their parts but Spade and Malick really steal the scenes.

This is a great show, just watch one or two at a time not the whole thing at once or it becomes monotonause and loses it's shine.

While the eponymous ""Assistant"" Cindy, played by Cheri Oteri, provides some laughs, it's actually the way in which Dennis and Elliot craftily supply Nina with all those inane, nonexistent words to spew forth on that NPR show--classic comedic sabotage--that distinguishes this episode for me.

2046178,5,B0001Z3I0S,"JUST SHOOT ME is one of those shows that aired for a long time, did really good in the ratings but never hit its stride as a major hit like FRIENDS.  Funny thing is that over times FRIENDS, though great, does seem a little dated and a comic gem like JUST SHOOT ME just gets better with age.  The ensemble cast here is genius.  There are high caliber celebs from different areas of entertainment coming together for immense comic unity.  George Segal, Wendie Malick, Laura San Giacomo, Dennis Spade and Enrico Colantoni each had an impressive resume behind them but it is here where they were all able to shine.  The plot is ingenious.  Serious writer Maya played by San Giacomo gets fired from her news writing job and must turn to her rich, womanizing father Jack Gallo, played by Segal, for a job at his fashion magazine Blush.  This type of magazine is definitely beneath the morals of Maya and there the plot is set.  She has been estranged from her father for years.  He was never there and is now remarried to a girl Maya's age.  The staff at Blush is eccentric indeed with former model Nina Van Horn hilariously played by Wendie Malick, Dennis the assistant played by David Spade and Elliot the photographer played by Colantoni.

Each character is filled with hilarious quirkiness yet are very realistic and believable at the same time.  They all also have human and tender sides that come out at just the right times.  The writing and producing are excellent and provide the framework for our great ensemble to work their comedic magic.  Here we have the 31 episodes from seasons 1 and 2 and they are presented beautifully in remastered glory totally uncut.  I watched this show when it aired, watched each episode numerous times in reruns and now had to purchase them so I could watch them whenever I wanted looking their best.  I know each episode by heart and they never stop making me laugh.  I love these characters and the great continuity in the characters and their relationships together that developed from season to season.  If you love this series then this is a must buy.  If you don't know it but love classic comedy at its best you will find nothing finer.  One of the best shows and casts ever.  Please release all the seasons on dvd for us die-hard fans.",1290902400,3,2279,4.5777777777777775

I attended a taping of an episode in 1997 (the episode was ""La Cage"").  It was a good time for all -- George Segal entertained us with his banjo playing and singing during breaks between set-ups.  The cast seemed to be having a great time and so did we.

I encourage you guys to buy this DVD set and enjoy the first two seasons.  If you haven't noticed, the sitcom seems to be a rapidly dying art form.  Nowadays there exists only a fraction of the number that ran on TV just a decade ago. Enjoy them while they last.  What else are you gonna do?  Buy DVDs of reality shows?

2046212,5,B0001Z3I0S,"I believe that you should not only give JUST SHOOT ME one shot.  You should give it many, many shots [not that I think that you will need more than one to thoroughly enjoy it!].  Blush Magazine, run by the irrepressible Jack Gallo (George Segal), takes a detour when his out-of-work daughter, Maya (Laura San-Giacomo) shows up, and he ends up finding her an editing position with the publication.  While his magazine's main focus is on sex and high fashion, Maya's aspirations take a decidedly different detour.  The Colombia-educated journalist wants to use her intellect and the magazine doesn't exactly give her the opportunity to do so, while editing sex quizzes.  What's more, she has to work with a slew of quirky and eccentric characters.  Among them are aging fashion model Nina Van Horne (Wendy Malick), photographer Elliott DiMorro (Enrico Colantoni) and Jack Gallo's personal assistant, Dennis Finch (David Spade).  They trade insults, as well as insight.  Eventually, they bond over life struggles and become [slightly] more close, as part of their journalistic dysfunctional family.

The jokes come hard and fast and JUST SHOOT ME's real strength lies in the great writing and the wonderful ensemble that brings is it to life.  It's truly a shame that the show didn't last longer.  I would say that the first two seasons were the strongest of the program.  You really get a sense of the characters and their struggles in the early episodes and they are definitely very entertaining.",1185062400,,1495,5.008097165991903
2046213,5,B0001Z3I0S,"The first 2 seasons were great (and deserve their 5 stars), and they deserve to be followed up by the rest of the seasons.  Attention Sony, and any other idiot company with a stake in this series, who are dragging their collective feet on getting the rest of the seasons out the door: Get your stupid ridiculous legal garbage sorted out YESTERDAY and get the freaking season sets into production!  We the fans don't care about who owns the music rights, or which actors had a rider in their contracts for royalties on the sets, which you are now arguing about, or whatever else ridiculous garbage you idiots are bickering about.  JUST. GET. IT. DONE!

Don't tick off your fan base like Mad About You did to theirs by pulling this exact same stunt.  I can tell by the sales numbers of Mad About You DVD sets that screwing the fans for so long has hurt the long term sales of Mad About You on DVD.  This is how boycotts happen, you morons.  This is also what prompts idiot teenagers/pirates to put up bootlegs of the seasons burned from copies of the show, onto their own DVDs, and to sell them on e-bay, and upload them to the internet at large.  Please don't let the idiot teenagers/pirates win!  You are LITERALLY in a race against the pirates.  You HAVE to get to market as fast as you can, if you want to sway the mildly legally minded consumer who might be tempted to just download the shows (I am not one of them, but I know a lot of college people who are) and not wait YEARS for the DVDs to come out.

Do whatever you have to do to get the sets out.  If it is music rights, then either yank the music out and have ANY COLLEGE BAND IN AMERICA do a new music piece for anything that gets yanked (and they will do it for free -- just to get their band name in the credits!) or just pay whatever it takes for the music, and then add an extra $2-5 dollars onto the DVD price, and pass the cost onto the consumer.  We don't care!  We just want the sets.  If you are worried about low sales numbers, then do a pre-order, and only print like 105% of the disks that were ordered, and keep doing pre-orders for every re-printing.  Amazon and anyone else who takes pre-orders will LOVE you if you do that.

It's mostly base around office antics, featuring Maya Gallo (Laura San Giacomo), whose a hard headed girl would have her own strong opinions on everything and pretty much against sexist acts, who got fired from her old job for some gag she did to an anchorwoman on the teleprompter and with the lack of choice, she went to work with her father's Fashion Magazine named Blush.

Self-absorbed Nina and midgetish Finch hardly worked. Balding Elliot had amazing luck with models. Jack was ditzy...I could go on and on describing these people.

Inspiring Nina quotes (hopefully these will spark some interest, although they're not all from the first 2 seasons):

""Never mention that show [The View] again!  I was this close to being the 20-something Asian woman!""

""Well, dear, people say a lot of things when they're lying.""

""What is truth?  A lie, wrapped in a riddle, dipped in a dream? Oh wait, that's nostalgia.""

""A bird in the hand is worth 2 if by sea.""

[To Maya] ""It's your fault!  You  made me donate my zebra-skin jacket!  I had it especially made for earth day!""

""That girl is wasting her youth at a place like college.""

2046250,4,B0001Z3I0S,"Steven Levitan's JUST SHOOT ME remains a refreshingly-hilarious sitcom, thanks to pin-sharp scripts and top performances from a perfect cast.  This box set includes the entire first and second seasons.

Young and idealistic journalist Maya Gallo (Laura San Giacomo) is fired from her newsroom job and has no other choice than to ask her father, Jack (George Segal) for money.  Instead he invites her to join the staff of his fashion magazine Blush.  Maya finds herself at odds with her co-workers including womanising photographer Elliott DiMauro (Enrico Colantoni), Jack's pint-sized insult-wielding assistant Dennis Finch (David Spade) and alcoholic over-the-hill fashion editor Nina Van Horn (Wendie Malick).

The first season (which only ran for 6 episodes) includes the controversial ""Lemon Wacky Hello"" where Elliott, Maya, Nina and Finch all fall under the effects of a hallucinogenic candy that Jack brought back from China.  Other choice moments come in ""The Devil and Maya Gallo"" where Maya's strict moral code is tested to its limits; and ""Nina's Birthday"" where Finch and Elliott make a very funny wager.

The second season includes some of the all-time classic eps:  ""The Assistant"" where Maya must contend with a very peculiar secretary; ""Sewer"" where Maya finally lands what she hopes is the biggest expose in the history of Blush; ""Pass the Salt"" where Finch's father (guest star Brian Dennehy) thinks that Finch is gay; ""Nina in the Cantina"" where Nina re-lives her greatest love affair and ""The Kiss"" which sets up the Maya-Elliott romance that would recurr throughout the rest of the series.

Extras include a great new retrospective with Steven Levitan and the cast; audio commentay on selected epidodes and a gallery of the Blush covers that featured through the episodes.

2046252,5,B0001Z3I0S,"While some Just Shoot Me fans claim ""the show got lame near the end,"" for me, the show was consistently funny up to the end. This was mostly due to the clever writing and the brilliant cast who after working together for all those seasons had developed that ""TV family chemistry"" that always made me want to tune in for each episode no matter what time slot NBC would move the show to. Shame on NBC for their poor treatment of Just Shoot Me.

However, what isn't poor is the first-rate treatment of this DVD collection. Great packaging with nice box and disc art which neatly aligns with the inner foldout background photos of the cast. All 31 hilarious Seasons 1 & 2 episodes are digitally remastered and unedited. I was actually surprised by the restored content while viewing the set, having grown accustomed to the syndicated episodes because they air so frequently. It blew me away to hear Jack's restored voiceover during the closing photo screenshot from ""The Walk"" episode as well as hearing Jack & Finch negotiate over the closing credits from ""My Dinner With Woody"" which were excised from the syndicated versions.

The extras are cool. The ""Always In Fashion"" featurette with show creator Steven Levitan and cast, the Blush covers photo gallery, and commentaries all complement the show and the set. Hopefully, the Season Three set will contain the original ""Pre-Finch"" pilot. Surprising that it's not a feature of this set, given how often its mentioned in the commentaries. Guest-stars include: Tom Poston (""Newhart""), David Rasche (""Sledge Hammer!""), Kevin Weisman (""Alias""), Michael McDonald (""Mad TV""), Harry Groener (""Dear John""), Megan Mullally (""Will & Grace""), Dana Carvey (""SNL""), Lisa Edelstein (""Superman: TAS"") and many others.

Brilliant writing and a cast that could deliver the goods, Just Shoot Me was show that didn't get the attention it deserved in the shadow of other comedy giants but it did have a very loyal following. The show just got better has the seasons went on, this first release is a must have. Episodes such as ""the experiment"" and ""emporer"" with Dana Carvey are absoulute jewels. You can't go wrong with this one.",1105056000,2,449,4.487804878048781
2046280,5,B0001Z3I0S,"I had not watched Just Shoot Me very often on tv, but decided to buy the series any ways.  I'm glad I did.  It is a show that I can just sit back and relax to.  You don't have to use your brain much and you laugh often.  It's under half an hour long, which can be good and bad.  Good in that if you only have a short time it's great entertainment.  Bad if you are used to watching hour long shows.  I've gone through seasons one and two pretty fast.  I can't wait for the rest of the seasons to come out on dvd.",1100995200,4,511,3.7547169811320753

2046282,5,B0001Z3I0S,"Watching this was so much fun! When i was done with the DVD i wished there were more seasons of this great show to buy. The show has a great cast and clever, witty writing. I can't remember which season it is but, there is a narrative Christmas episode featuring David Spade (Dennis Finch) as the narrator. I loved that one and had wished i had taped it. Hopefully if the entire show is released on DVD i'll have it to watch every Christmas. Wendie Malik (Nina Van Horn) never fails to make me laugh. The cast works so well together which makes the show a joy to watch!",1093305600,9,569,4.229357798165138
