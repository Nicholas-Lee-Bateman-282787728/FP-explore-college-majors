5711320,2,B00CBG9SQS,"The original premise sounded good; and the acting was good., oh, and also the scenery  That's about as far as I can go
with that adjective on this movie!
My main complaint probably would have to be the ultra crude language
spewing out of the lead actor's mouth.  That turned me off, completely.
If the writer thought this was at all necessary; I totally disagree.
It just ruined it for me.",1375056000,2,389,4.464788732394366

5711323,5,B00CBG9SQS,"I had never heard of this film before I stumbled onto it ""in progress"" on the LMN channel yesterday. WOW..sweet, funny, incredible performances by both actresses. Other reviewers have told you about the plot in detail so I won't go there, beside I missed the first part, but I did see most of it and loved every minute. FINALLY a filmmaker creates a REAL story about the feelings that REAL people can still have for each other, even after 30 years. My grandparents had that kind of love and no they were not lesbians. But this is not really a lesbian film. It is a film about any two people who manage to sustain their love for each other in spite of a judgmental society hostile to diversity and age. It is not really a family film because of the nudity and language but you can't find a film with better values of acceptance and respect for human dignity.",1369872000,18,857,4.39622641509434
5711324,5,B00CBG9SQS,"for how good this movie is.  I went to see it, not expecting all that much.  It was fantastic.  There were times there was so much laughter in the theater that we all pretty much missed the next couple of lines.  The other reviewers have pretty much given the storyline, so I won't go there again.  But the cast is wonderful, the story is wonderful.....guess it's just wonderful!  I was starting to wonder if it would ever be out on DVD, so I'm excited that it will be in my relatively small DVD collection.  I've seen several ""lesbian"" movies, which always left me wanting something else in the way of a plot.  This one did not.  If you like a good love story, you won't be disappointed.",1369267200,12,688,4.354330708661418
5711325,5,B00CBG9SQS,"Stella (Olympia Dukakis) and Dot (Brenda Fricker) have spent 31 years together, both women now in their 70s are beginning to lose some of their faculties, this however does not affect the love they feel for each other. When Dot's granddaughter Molly (Kristin Booth) decides to put Dot into a nursing home, the frustrated Stella must take matters into her own hands to ensure that she and Dot can stay together.

Armed with a battered old truck and the ambition to protect their relationship by getting married in Canada, Stella and Dot embark on a journey from Maine to Nova Scotia. Along the way they pickup hitchhiker Prentice (Ryan Doucette) making his own voyage home to visit his dying mother.

Director Thom Fitzgerald brings a thoughtful and extremely timely film to the screen with this trio of unique characters. Although dealing with the very real threat of a lesbian couple being forced apart in their golden years, Thompson's clever use of humour drives the reality of the situation home.

Olympia Dukakis is wonderful as the brash Stella, with a filthy vocabulary. Despite the bravado, she is really just a sweet and tender woman trying to keep her family together. Brenda Fricker is equally outstanding as Stella's longtime partner Dot.

5711326,5,B00CBG9SQS,"Two elderly women, Stella (Dukakis) and Dot (Fricker), who have lived together for 31 years in a small cottage by the sea in Maine, are deceptively separated from each other when Dot's granddaughter Molly puts Dot in a nursing home because she feels Stella is not capable of caring for her any longer.  Molly is clueless about their relationship, which is hard to swallow.  Although Dot has been blind for many years, Stella handles it with aplomb.  Stella is a feisty butch woman who swears like a sailor, wears a tattered cowboy hat, and drinks too much tequila. Her acerbic remarks and confrontations evoke most of the humor in this film.  Dot, in contrast, is sweet, plump, speaks with an Irish accent, has soft curly white hair and comes across initially as a passive grandmotherly type. Stella cleverly steals (rescues) Dot and they set out on the lam to Nova Scotia, where they understand same-sex marriage is legal.  On the way they pick up a hitchhiker, Prentice, played by handsome newcomer Ryan Doucette, to help them cross the Canadian border and not be suspect.  Prentice is a young naive country male turned modern dancer who is making his way to his sick mother.

The chemistry of the actors and the clever dialogue interactions will bring viewers to laughter and tears.  At one point Stella is knocking a naked man off her windshield; at another, Dot accidentally lies in a bed next to a naked man, and the ensuing scramble to escape each other results in one of the most explicit and comedic moments in the film. Strong characters (and strong expletives) and the clear struggles just to be themselves, connect to the audience with a resonance that transcends whether someone is gay, lesbian, transgendered or straight...it is about universal love and the struggle to find your way and place in the world.

The heroic quest to stay together and what the characters endure along the way is something most everyone can identify with, which is why there's been little controversy about this movie, according to its writer and director, Thom Fitzgerald.  It isn't focused on the lesbian aspect, which appears incidental, but the recognition of the moving, profound love of an octogenarian couple trying to stay out of a nursing home and remain together.  The journey is cinematically gorgeous and expansive as they travel from New England to Canada, much like their relationship, which evolves in the openness and beauty of the scenery. This is the first starring role for Olympia Dukakis and she's a hero.  Cloudburst seems to be one of those perfect moments in time when you realize you've been touched by great love.

Finally got around to watching this one.  I thought it'd be much too geriatric and depressing to hold my interest.  One lead says she's 80 and the other is probably older.  And she is blind to boot-- with maybe a touch of dementia setting in.  But they tried to throw in a whole lot of raunchy and a whole lot of slapstick screwball comedy stuff to keep it light. And mostly they did.  Ultimately, I felt much of the raunchy comedy came off as contrived and gratuitous and it took a lot of the authenticity out of the story.  So I didn't rate it too high.

Basically, it's about a couple of old lesbos in rural Maine who've been together for 31 years.  Stella (Olympia Dukakis) is a foul-mouthed and cranky curmudgeon who keeps getting mistaken for a man and can't open her mouth without shocking or offending everyone around her.  And Dot (Brenda Fricker) is her adorable elderly mate who is as sweet as can be and seldom fails to find her Stella amusing.  They definitely have a way of complementing each other and I found that dynamic a sweet one.

When Dot falls out of bed and hurts herself, she is tricked by her idiot relative into signing her life away into a nursing home.  Their union isn't acknowledged at all.  A very shunned and pissed off Stella is determined to take her life and partner back so she sneaks Dot out of the hospital and off they drive to Canada to get married in some last chance effort to validate their union and their lives.

Much of the story is this crazy road trip.  Along the way they pick up a hunky male stripper with mommy issues who becomes their cute and helpful little pet.  He spends a good chunk of the movie with his shirt open and a cowboy hat on... a look that is sure to give the gays and straight girls plenty of eye candy.  Add to that a good 5 minutes straight of loud and clear full on male frontal nudity by his father (that includes Dot getting boinked in the head with his man parts, no less) and I can see why a pile of lezzies are annoyed with this one.  It didn't exactly offend me, I just didn't see much of a point in it... other than this film was determined to draw in both gays and lesbians. So... butt, wiener, and chest shots for the guys... 80+ old ladies for the gals??? hmm.  Not surprised the writer/director is a male who isn't straight.  Naked dudes and harmless old ladies is probably one to amuse the boys.  I didn't mind the male hitchhiker, though.  He was a weirdly amusing fit with these two and the chemistry just worked... even if he could have been easily replaced with a talking dog or a dancing bear.  Male nudity and some lesbian kisses is all you see here.  No sex.

Things resolve just about as good as you might expect.  But we don't exactly get a happy ending.  Typical.  The story is definitely a good lesson in putting your affairs in proper order for you and your queer mate (and making them relative-proof) before those unpredictable golden years set in.",1418774400,2,2957,4.344890510948905

Loving portrayals of two individuals who are surprised and yet up to and eager for the act of making their commitment one of marriage. With love, tenderness a dash of Dukakis' characters grudgingly drawn out wry wisdom. The love blossoms in many manifold wondrous ways into a new definition of family. maybe not so old just that who we have as our family can be our choice.

A gentle, funny road-trip movie that takes us, at nearly every turn, from laughter to winsome reflection, wisdom and most of all redemption and a unity much sought out and needed; by most everyone of us. This is a film for everyone. Everyone who delights in the story of and the glory of love.

This was a GREAT film....funny and touching!!!  Easily the best new movie I've seen in a couple years and certainly better than anything playing locally.

But the trailer didn't show the rampant vulgarity of the lead character that was so over the top that i needed to wash out my ears. I'm fine with crusty seniors, but an 80 year old who speaks like a dock worker is unbelievable. The humor was mostly flat and the sentiment often fell short. The last 15 minutes was decent but not enough to redeem this movie. There was potentially a good story here but I was disappointed.

Olympia Dukakis is brilliant. She has excellent chemistry with Brenda Fricker, and the two play a very believable ""old married couple."" There is a bit of a gap in the explanation of why Tommy (Michael McPhee) is suddenly so trusted by the couple, but aside from that he has good chemistry with both of them as well. Molly (Kristin Booth) is essentially the catalyst of the movie, throwing the plot into motion, in what is actually an extremely believable scenario for many elderly same sex couples in America today.

5711465,1,B00CBG9SQS,"So disappointed! After reading the reviews, I thought it sounded like a rare gem.  I love Dukakis.

However....from the opening scene to the last it was a chopped up, superficial, overly acted mess of a movie.  It lacked depth and character development.
In my opinion, it reinforced negative stereotypes of same sex relationships by having blatant jokes about infidelity.  Dukakis really over played her ""butch"" role and the other actress added little to the movie.  My biggest gripe, instead of taking advantage of having the funding of such a film (which is rare), and taking the time to create a meaningful and educational film about two people of the same gender, in love, wanting the same things as other couples in love, while coping with the dynamics of that love not being socially acceptable and the repercussions of aging on top of that...well, it could have been powerful.  Instead, it was a loss.  The film was a wasted opportunity to make something meaningful.  It lacked emotion, character development, and a deep story line....it made no sense at all, on the verge of trying to be a comedy at times.  Ugh!

My fiancee and i couldn't believe how extremely contrived it was. The love between these two women was to be assumed before the movie started but little was shown while the film was rolling. And was all that male nudity necessary, it seemed extremely gratuitous. Is perhaps the male director/writer into such? That's the only reason that seems at all plausible that this film included so many dicks and balls.  And the writing? extremely sophomoric lesbian dialogue.

5711494,5,B00CBG9SQS,"A poignant story of two older lesbians having their lives turned upside down and forced to deal with extreme measures to stay together after 31 years.  It is hilariously funny and emotionally heartbreaking. The language from ""Stella"" is crude but not enough to take away from the actual storyline and if you are open minded enough to see past the vulgar language you will see ""Stella"" for what she really is, a woman who loves her partner with her whole body and soul and will do anything to get her back. This is true life and it is happening somewhere to someone everyday.  Olympia Dukakis and Brenda Fricker should be applauded for bringing this story to life and making it real. I laughed until I almost peed and cried to the point I had to pause the movie to dry the tears enough to where I could focus again! This movie is not just about the LGBT community but for everyone and anyone who are in love and living with their life partners with commitments of ""til death do us part"". I recommend it to any adult who enjoys a beautiful love story.

Dukakis comes across as a 'rough as guts' lesbian with a tender heart.

I should have been forewarned. While I am not a prude about language, foul mouthed is an understatement. The language is over-the-top vulgar and crude.

It is a joy to see a film that has parts for women at this age and demographic regardless of the writing. Olympia Dukakis and Brenda Fricker give performances that are well tailored and classy and it isn't hard to sympathize with the two characters situation from the start.
The two of them are in a league of their own.
The rest of the cast is not of the same caliber and it is very clear.
BUT if you can get past the mediocre acting, there are two nude male scenes with supporting cast members. Possibly for anyone that might assume this is a film solely for old lesbians.

Go for it! You'll laugh and cry!",1376352000,,867,4.487341772151899
5711562,5,B00CBG9SQS,"Olympia Dukakis' performance and character made a very strong impression on me. I think the movie is very well done, I loved the story, I loved the hyperbole of all of the characters. Everything was a titch over the top but it all worked well together. Unexpected enjoyment.

Mature subject matter, harsh language, and some nudity.",1376352000,,331,4.910714285714286
5711563,1,B00CBG9SQS,"Judging from the reviews, I figured this was a ""can't miss"" choice for my husband and me.  We love smart, salty humor; quirky characters; and out-of-the-mainstream plots.  This movie was a huge disappointment on almost every count.  The word ""contrived"" describes just about everything in it: the attempts at humor, Dukakas's acting, the syrupy sets and music, the hitchhiker's ""rain dance""...  Ugh.  And was there a contest among the writers to see how many female genital remarks/snarks they could work into the dialog?  Poor Dukakas was left sounding like a junior high kid trying to impress her buddies by seeing how much she could shock them.  Subtlety and intelligence were sorely lacking.  --  To each her own, for sure, but this one sure wasn't for me.",1376265600,7,760,4.968253968253968
5711564,5,B00CBG9SQS,"This is one terrific story and Olympia Dukakis delivers an awesome portrayal of an older, old-line dyke.  The topic is very current and this is a great movie for friends and family to see if they are trying to grasp what marriage equality is all about.  Besides, it is side splittingly, wonderfully funny.  There is one full male nudity scene, but a terribly funny scene.  The language is purposefully terrible, so that is what makes it not suitable for children.  Do yourself and your adult friends a favor and rent or buy this movie.  You won't regret it.",1376265600,,557,4.63265306122449
5711565,4,B00CBG9SQS,"The story has an impact , doesn't matter if your straight or gay. If your blind or can see. This movie was a heart felt story of what love might be....
Funny', entertaining,.fearless,....",1376179200,2,187,4.696969696969697
5711566,5,B00CBG9SQS,"The two main characters are really well played by awesome ladies. The other actors didn't do as well. The story gets confusing a time or two, but that's to be expected on the budget that a lesbo movie gets. YAY lesbo movies!!!",1375747200,,226,4.404761904761905
5711567,5,B00CBG9SQS,"I recommend this movie to anyone, not just the gay community. It deals with so many current issues about love, companionship, compassion, commitment, and ageless beauty. Unfortunately, it also deals with the not so kind issues of sending aged loved ones to homes that may just kill them, instead of loving them to the end of their lives. Sacrificing one's life for the care of our parents or grandparents (or any elderly relative) has long been lost in our society. This gives us hope that people and society can change, if they care to try.",1375747200,,541,4.705263157894737
5711568,4,B00CBG9SQS,"The story isn't much but the performances of Olympia Dukakis & Brenda Fricker are wonderful. Sometimes, in the twilights of their careers, great film actors get a chance to strut their stuff one last time. We've seen it with Lilian Gish, Henry Fonda, & Katherine Hepburn. Add Olympia & Brenda to that list. Watch this film & see what I mean.",1375747200,,341,4.60655737704918
5711569,1,B00CBG9SQS,"I would rate it ""minus"" 5 if I could. What a waste of good actors. I couldn't finish the movie.",1375660800,6,95,3.8
5711570,5,B00CBG9SQS,"Fantastic story line with great actresses and actors. Very funny and endearing this movie is an amazing find and a delight to watch, true quality that is rear these days. A movie anyone can watch and enjoy. Not often I talk about a movie too others as much as I have done with this one!",1375660800,2,286,4.218181818181818
5711571,5,B00CBG9SQS,"An enjoyable and heartfelt ride across the northern border with two stellar actors delivering great performances. Olympia Dukakis has some of the best biting lines that add levity to the serious situation. The movie moves at a good pace and keeps things interesting as the characters develop throughout the film. This movie is a celebration of love and the beautiful life that these ladies share. A few tears may be shed, but there are plenty more laughs and you will certainly be smiling by the end.",1375574400,2,500,4.825581395348837
5711572,5,B00CBG9SQS,I also stumbled across this movie on Amazon.  It was very entertaining.  I laughed at some points until I cried.  It is a love story and brings up many emotions.,1375574400,,161,4.3
5711573,4,B00CBG9SQS,"I'll watch Olympia Dukakis in anything so I was thrilled when this movie turned out to be so well done.  A sweet love story and a nice story of HUMAN interaction.  Definitely worth a watch for people who like ""story"" films as opposed to ""plotless shoot em up action"" films.",1375401600,2,273,4.44
5711574,5,B00CBG9SQS,"I did not know what to expect when I found this movie, but I did know that I had always enjoyed Olympia and Brenda in other roles, so I thought this could not be bad. I found myself absorbed with the gritty reality of the story, and although I do not especially like expletive-filled dialog, I found it to be a realistic part of the reality and soon accepted the language as part of Stella's character (she was also a person of deep feeling, which endeared her all the more). Dot was lovable from the beginning, of course. I don't believe anyone could have played the roles better than these two veteran grand dames of the movie. Also, the young man who played Prentis was refreshingly real and in some ways quite sad, which rounded out his character. The whole film was gripping, yet releasing. What a beautiful story. The ending was one that moved me to tears. I think, in my heart, I knew the film might end the way it did, but I had hoped otherwise. In a word, ""remarkable"" is how I would rate this film. Please watch with an open mind and heart. This might sound ""cheesy"" to some, but I honestly feel that I am a better person from having watched this film. Don't deprive yourself -- watch it!",1375401600,,1198,4.352678571428571
5711575,5,B00CBG9SQS,"This was a roller coaster of emotions.  Laugh out loud scenes!!  A little vulgar, but it makes for a great character! Would watch again!!",1375228800,,137,4.666666666666667
5711576,3,B00CBG9SQS,"I was so looking forward to this film. I love these two actresses and I love good lesbian films, but this was just stupid. I'd rate it just below a Lifetime movie and it's replete with Dukakis playing a stereotype of an ""old dyke"" and the granddaughter and hitchhiker are just as two dimensional. When I read the reviews, I decided that I had to see this TODAY, so I rented this and I have two bucks left on my credit card. That's how desperate I was to see it. It's not worth the rental fee; it's that bad. There are moments that are so dumb that I even said out loud, ""WTF?"" Every scene is predictable and though I am a chronic cryer at sad endings, this one did nothing for me. I'm still trying to figure out why it won so many awards. The sad part, it had the potential to be wonderful. I don't blame the actors as much as I do the writing. I could have written this in the 5th grade. Maybe one day, there will be good films that happen to have lesbian characters. This, however, is not that day.

P.S. I love Olympia Dukakis but she acts as if she's playing herself playing a cardboard, butch lesbian. I gave this an ""It's OK"" only for the onscreen kiss between her and Fricker.",1375142400,4,1183,4.165938864628821
