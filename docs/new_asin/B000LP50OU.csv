Most were great, but this one was TOTALLY IN CHINESE with NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES OR TRANSLATIONS.  The photography was nice but very frustrating since I could not understand one word.  NO WHERE IN THE DESCRIPTION WAS I WARNED THAT THIS WAS NOT IN ENGLISH AND HAD NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES!!!! WHAT A RIPOFF!  HAD I KNOWN I WOULD NOT HAVE ORDERED THIS AT ALL!!
