8633467,1,B00HM7ZNTM,"The film itself offers next to nothing, except perhaps for steam locomotive fans and those interested in seeing Jean Arthur in a silent role. Both will be disappointed because the picture quality is so bad. At times, Arthur's face is no more than two holes, for her eyes, in a white blob. Really, there is nothing here worth spending $$ on.",1463011200,,340,4.590163934426229
