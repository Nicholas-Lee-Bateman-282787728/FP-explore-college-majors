3157511,5,B0016KHA4W,"This popular Showtime feature could not be better timed for today's society and economy.  Two aging ladies learn to rely on each other to navigate the difficulties of living on a fixed income in an ever-more expensive world.  The characters are real, the drama believable and the comedy timed just right to keep the film in balance.  Terrific, you'll love it!",1223769600,5,359,4.852459016393443
3157512,5,B0016KHA4W,"I thoroughly loved this movie, in fact adored parts of it.  This work should have won some major awards... it is funny, sad, poignant and tough at all the right moments.  Louise Fletcher and Cicely Tyson gave sterling, award-worthy performances and Lea Delaria is certainly no slouch in the acting department.  I'm saddened to see this movie discontinued, there is a real market for it.  Catch it when you can.  Bravo to the producers and cast for a delicious movie.",1223596800,5,466,4.775
3157513,2,B0016KHA4W,"I tried to stick with it, but it was too boring.
Didn't really get what was going on, even after 30 minutes.",1365897600,,108,3.9545454545454546
3157514,2,B0016KHA4W,I found the characters of Squeaky & Fat Rosie to be obnoxious. I did not see the humor at all. I did not finish watching the movie. Horrible acting!,1364083200,,148,4.137931034482759
3157515,1,B0016KHA4W,"Couldn't stand this movie. After watching this movie for twenty minutes, I couldn't take it anymore.  I went back to check the reviews, because I thought I had seen that all the reviews were high. They were. So I thought maybe I didn't give the movie enough time. So I went back and watched some more. I even forwarded the movie to see if it got better. It didn't!  It bored me to death and was annoying. Very rarely do I not finish a movie. Sorry to say, this was one I just could not do.",1363219200,,489,4.083333333333333
3157516,4,B0016KHA4W,It was a interesting story.  I did not think the characters of Fat Rose and Squeaky were necessay.  It was a heartwarning story about friendship,1362528000,,144,4.72
3157517,4,B0016KHA4W,Had to watch a couple of times to really get the plot. Loved it. Made me think about mental illness another way.,1357257600,2,112,4.136363636363637
3157518,5,B0016KHA4W,"I first saw this movie on Showtime and thought how well written the story is.  The acting was excellent.  The ""message"" of the movie stayed with me long after I saw the movie.  I wanted to share it with friends and ordered extra copies to give at Christmas.  They also liked the movie quite a lot.  I highly recommend this movie.",1231286400,5,329,4.327868852459017
3157519,5,B0016KHA4W,"Moving, funny, smart, multi-layered humor, wisdom packed.....this wonderful play by virland s harris was directed by Stan Irwin and brought to life with sterling performances by it's outstanding 5 woman cast. It's a work of genius, beautifully done. This movie is Academy Award worthy and it's a shame it didn't make it to the Big Screen theaters to be seen by the wider audience it so richly deserves.  Do yourself a favor and buy this movie..... and tell your friends about it!",1231200000,3,479,4.841463414634147
3157520,5,B0016KHA4W,"This is a must see movie on so many levels.  The two lead actresses
(Cicely Tyson and Louise Fletcher) are enormously gifted and sharing
their skills at the height of their craft.  The script to wonderfully
tight, drawing the audience to make a strong emotional and intellectual
investment in the story.  The cinematography is accessible, providing
images that are familiar but not overly comfortable.  As an art form,
this is a tender yet biting tale of character.  As a piece of social
education, it should be required viewing for all those who are in the
position of eldercare giver.  This movie will have you thinking about
the circumstances and situations long after you viewed it.  If not
before the final credit plays, you will be thinking of all those you
wish would also see the film -- to help them understand a most complex
part of the closing of life.  Let's hope that this author and producer
has more to share with us in the future.",1228694400,5,946,4.656626506024097
3157521,5,B0016KHA4W,Each time I have watched this film the more I appreciate it. Ms. Fletcher and Tyson are amazing professionals who carry this film elegantly and credibly. Their friendship is a true sisterhood despite their many differences. You can run through the gamut of feelings of how our elders are treated and viewed and how they adapt.,1228089600,3,326,4.839285714285714
3157522,5,B0016KHA4W,"I was very pleasantly surprised in watching this movie. The performances from both leads were incredibly real. The cinematography was beautiful and the storyline was believable.

8262921,1,B0016KHA4W,"Unacceptable language !

From the start filthy language was offensive to my family.

How could this be rated pg13?  Thank You",1399939200,,125,4.857142857142857
8262922,1,B0016KHA4W,"It was just too crude -  It could have been a good film.  The dialog doesn t make sense, the name of the colored actress escapes me, but I have seen her in many films, but in this one, she had a fake accent.  The older lady seemed to be a good actress and had a good role, but squeaky and fat rose were ridiculous.",1393891200,,314,3.8
8262923,5,B0016KHA4W,"This is a great movie to watch by yourself or with gal pals. Re-enforces the power of love, friendship and the strong bonds we have as women.",1392422400,,141,4.2592592592592595
8262924,1,B0016KHA4W,I could not make it past the first 10 minutes of this movie.  Stupid and slow and a poorly made,1392336000,,95,3.75
8262925,1,B0016KHA4W,"If I could give it LESS than one star, I would.  I've tried twice to watch it and gave up early on.  Cicily Tyson and Louise Fletcher were great......just couldn't stand Fat Rose and Squeaky.",1381622400,,191,4.428571428571429
8262926,2,B0016KHA4W,"Cicely Tyson was the only one in this movie I can give credit to for rising above poor material to work with and bad directing. The idea behind this story is intriguing, and as someone who has worked with the mentally failing senior population for years, I can appreciate this interesting view of their thought processes, The idea was good, but lost in poor writing and directing.",1372118400,,380,4.686567164179104
8262927,1,B0016KHA4W,Fat Rose and Squeaky are absolutely obnoxious and mean. It was not at all entertaining and I shut it off after about 15 minutes.,1370217600,,128,4.375
8262928,2,B0016KHA4W,"We did not care for this at all, not our style . very slow getting going if it got going at all.",1366502400,,96,3.409090909090909
8262929,5,B0016KHA4W,"I too had trouble for the first several minutes, didn't know where it was going but stuck with it and enjoyed it and laughed.  Then I watched it a couple of weeks later and came to appreciate the characters and depth of writing. Dealing with aging relatives this movie really hit home.  Louise Fletcher is a down-to-earth, hard-knocked realist to Cicely Tyson's ethereal, easy-going, comforting soul who together deal with the other often -intrusive 3 ladies.  It's a look at an interesting life and the necessity to maintain control over one's life, and where friendship eases the struggles of age and the demons of doubt it may bring. But also, there are some very funny scenes.",1366329600,,680,4.844827586206897
