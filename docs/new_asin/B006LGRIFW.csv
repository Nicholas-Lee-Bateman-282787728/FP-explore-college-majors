8500330,4,B006LGRIFW,"This TNA Twin Pack contains the final two PPV's of 2011 & covers the fallout of Bound For Glory. The main story around this time was the heavy changes in the World Championship picture as James Storm defeated Kurt Angle to become the TNA Champion only for Bobby Roode to win the title from him two weeks later & turn his back on his former Beer Money tag partner along with his other Fortune teammates in the process. Also during this time, Sting was put in charge of the decision making in the TNA while Gail Kim returned to TNA after her controversial exit from WWE.

Turning Point '11
Television Champion Eric Young vs. Robbie E - Eric Young started off with his usual silliness locking up with the referee & Val on the outside while psyching out Robbie E at one point doing a headstand on the top rope only to catch Robbie into a head scissors & had Robbie following him as he kept going in & out of the ring. Robbie T (Rob Terry) had to nail Young with a clothesline on the outside in order for Robbie E to get an advantage but Young recovered & continued with his silliness of stripping off his clothes while out-wrestling E with an elbow drop & crossbody onto both E & T on the floor before Robbie T once again got involved allowing Robbie E to take home the championship. This was a fun opening match if you like the comedy of Eric Young but nothing more past that.

Tag Team Champions Mexican America & Sarita vs. Ink Inc. & Toxxin - This was under mixed tag rules where the men must face the men & women against the women but the tag team titles were on the line so Toxxin could win the titles for Ink Inc. if she pinned Sarita. M.A. showed that they had the power advantage early while Ink Inc. showed they were superior when it comes to speed. At one point Hernandez held Neal over the apron while Anarquia dropkicked him through the ropes to the floor with Moore catching Hernandez afterwords with a asia moonsault to the outside. The ladies did eventually get involved with Neal helping Toxxin with an elevated legdrop onto Anarquia & tried to expose the tattoo they gave him weeks earlier only for Sarita to resort to dirty tactics to save the titles for her team. This was one of those matches that you could tell everyone was trying to work hard but definitely had some moments where they were ""off.""

X Division Champion Austin Aries vs. Jesse Sorensen vs. Kid Kash - Both Kash & Aries came into the match with an agreement to take out Sorensen which we saw come into play right from the start as one man stepped in to assist the other whenever Jesse started to fight back from the beat down the other was giving him but Jesse was able to mount some offense like hip tossing Kash onto Aries followed by a dive onto both men. Jesse being the odd man out didn't work in his favor as both men took turns just beating him down but tension between Kash & Aries started when Kash kept going for a pinfall attempt only for Aries to remind him to stick to the plan with Jesse attempting to divide & conquer by knocking one guy out of the ring while working over the other. Aries & Kash went back to double teaming by having dueling chops on Jesse while Kash held him for Aries to do his suicide dive only for Kash to breakup Aries pin attempt just to beat on Jesse more. Jesse kept fighting including blocking & moving out of the way with back to back top rope attempts but Kash continued to beat on Jesse with an impactful suplex & his ""Money Maker"" piledriver only for Aries to pull off some sneaky tactics of his own to make sure that Kash ""stuck to the plan."" This was a great match as each man told their story going into the match well with Sorensen having the ""never say die"" mentality, Kash being bitter & ruthless, and Aries being the cunning champion.

No Disqualification Match: Rob Van Dam vs. Christopher Daniels - Before the match, Daniels convinced RVD to have a regular match & ignore the ""No DQ"" stipulation. RVD was in control early with various kicks (including one that knocked out Daniels) followed by his rolling thunder & a legdrop on the apron. Daniels recovered & attempted to ground RVD with head & chinlocks along with a death valley driver before taking advantage of the ""No DQ"" rule by fighting up the ramp where RVD took advantage with a hip toss on the ramp followed by his running legdrop onto Daniels hanging on the guardrail. A chair came into play with Daniels doing a Rock Bottom on the chair before he went for the screwdriver he's been using for the past few weeks only for RVD to block it with the chair followed by the Van Daminator & 5 Star for the win. Outside of the Jerry Lynn matches, this was RVD's best performance in recent memory while Daniels was really on point as far as his character goes.

Matt Morgan vs. Crimson - Both men were in stalemates early when trying test of strength including Morgan knocking him down a discus clothesline only for Crimson to return the favor with a running clothesline knocking Morgan down as they took the match to the floor when Crimson tried to throw Morgan into the steps only for him to leap over them & kick the steps into Crimson's leg. Both men were very evenly match as Morgan's elbows in the corner had no effect on Morgan while both later kicked out of each others signature holds & just continued to beat on each other with each man daring the other to give them their best punch to the point where both men were enjoying it & kept shoving the referee out of the way so they could continue the fight before & after the bell. This was designed to be two evenly matched giants in a slugfest which it did showcase but past that, this match wasn't much of anything.

Mr. Anderson & Abyss vs. Scott Steiner & Bully Ray - Before the match, check out the interview between Bully & Steiner as they are comedic on the mic. With the Immortal members realizing that Abyss was back to being ""The Monster"" he was before, they singled out Anderson & kept Abyss out of the match. The crowd for some reason was heavily behind Scott Steiner more than anything else with their various chants of ""We Want Steiner!"" when Bully was in the ring & chanting his name when he was in the ring to the point where Scott had to try to heel them by saying ""F-U"" & yelling for the crowd to shut up while giving them the finger. Immortal kept taunting Abyss but a miscommunication between them allowed Abyss to make the tag & dominate including a big splash off the top rope but Anderson got tagged back in with Steiner hitting Anderson's on Mic Check followed by a Frankensteiner from the top rope after the crowd chanted for it before Abyss was tagged back in & dominate his way to victory. The match itself & the aftermath involving the table was to setup that ""The Monster"" Abyss was back & a force to be reckoned with which was established but definitely the highlight was Scott Steiner having more crowd support than anyone else in the match.

Knockouts Champion Velvet Sky vs. Gail Kim - Velvet took the fight to Gail right away executing moves like a running dropkick through the ropes onto Gail on the outside followed by a running crossbody. Gail was able to recover & worked over Sky's midsection with a running shoulderblock in the corner, abdominal stretch, and dropping Velvet across the stomach on her knee. This was a good back & forth match with us getting more out of Gail than we ever saw in her last WWE run.

Jeff Hardy vs. Jeff Jarrett - All I can say for the first moment of the match is ""Don't Blink"" as Hardy pulled a fast one on Jarrett which he couldn't handle & had the match restarted. Jarrett got in control & tried to keep Hardy down limiting his daredevil offense throughout the match but he was able to catch Jarrett again in the blink of an eye which drove Jarrett crazy causing him to use a chair & force the referee back in the ring to restart the match again only for Hardy to once again catch Jarrett for the third time in a row. This entire scenario was pretty entertaining & did it's job in putting Hardy over big time in his first major comeback match.

TNA Champion Bobby Roode vs. A.J. Styles - It should be noted that Styles had an injured ankle so he came into this match not at 100%. Roode attempted a cheap shot out of the corner & A.J. responded by just beating him down & delivered a dropkick but ended up starting to favor his ankle afterwords. A.J. continued to take the fight to Roode as he leaped off the apron onto Roode in the corner & dropped him on the guardrail. Roode resorted to using the referee in order to get the advantage but A.J. just kept coming including delivering one hell of a superplex that ended up hurting both men. Both men showed that they knew each other so well that they were able to keep countering each others moves including a series that went from a Styles Clash into a crossface into a powerbomb & Roode later countering the Styles Clash again into a roll-up. This was a solid main event from start to finish.

Final Resolution '11
Rob Van Dam vs. Christopher Daniels - Unlike their previous PPV match, this match was under normal rules instead of ""No DQ."" Both men exchanged back & forth exchanges early with Daniels eventually gaining control & grounding RVD while mocking him & working over the midsection throughout the match. This was an average match but they seemed to be off & never left first gear which is a big step down from their match on the last PPV.

Television Champion Robbie E vs. Eric Young - Young started this match with off a suicide dive through the ropes onto Robbie E having Robbie T getting involved & distracting Young for E to get the advantage. E grounded Young but Eric was able to recover with a bodyslam & elbow drop but T got involved again leading to Young at one point showing a heavy test of strength by carrying both E & T on his back before E was able to steal another win. This match was solid but almost a carbon copy of the match they had at Turning Point.

Tag Team Champions Matt Morgan & Crimson vs. The Pope & Devon - This started out with Crimson dominating Pope before tagging in Morgan who demanded that Devon come in for Morgan to have control over him. It took a blind tag by Pope for them to gave some momentum but they couldn't hold down the champions who singled out Pope & worked him over with power moves before Devon tagged in only for Morgan & Crimson to continue working over Devon on their way to victory while Pope stayed on the floor near Devon's sons. This was one of those ""push a storyline"" matches as it just showed the dominate teamwork of Morgan & Crimson while furthering the ""never ending"" storyline between Devon, Pope, and Devon's sons.

X Division Champion Austin Aries vs. Kid Kash - This was a rare encounter here as both men were the top heels in the division & both were trying to out cheat each other from the very start with trading chops, both grabbing each others ears & both wrestlers caught with their feet on the ropes for leverage during a rollup. There was one point in the match were Aries looked like he was knocked out which Kash followed up on an impactful stomach first slam only for Aries to counter an attempted top rope powerbomb with a head scissors. Both men at one point went to use a pair a knuckles only for the referee to each each guy but Aries was able to out cheat Kash in one instance to retain his title. While this wasn't the best X division match as far as action goes, they told a good story here about both men being heels & made for some entertaining moments at times.

Knockouts Champion Gail Kim vs. Mickie James - Hopefully this gets fixed on the DVD but on the live PPV, they had some technical difficulties to they aired the same video package about the buildup to this match twice back to back. Mickie came out in control with Gail regaining it by snapping Mickie down from the top rope off her shoulders landing face first. From there Gail heavily worked over her legs with various submissions like the indian deathlock while Gail's legs would eventually become a target as well with moves like a dragon screw. This is one of my favorite knockouts matches in months because you clearly saw that both girls worked their butts off here.

James Storm vs. Kurt Angle - Both men were trying to out-wrestle each other early with grounded moves like the hammerlock, head scissors, side headlock, and armbar. Angle proceeded to work over Storm's head by using the steps on the outside, various kicks & stomps & punches, and multiple german suplexes. Angle also was able to counter Storm's superkick into the anklelock before Storm decided to work on Angle's head on his own including a hanging DDT on the ring apron. Solid match from both men did a great job here in the ring while also playing off the story of Storm's concussion.

Cage Match: Jeff Hardy vs. Jeff Jarrett - This match had various stipulations attached to it such as Karen Jarrett would be handcuffed to Sting at ringside while Hardy would be fired if he lost but would get a World Title match if he won along with one of the Jarrett's being fired as well. Both men attempted to climb out the cage various times early on in the match with Jarrett countering one attempt by shoving Hardy down on his head while Hardy used his unique daredevil offense here such as a body splash & attempted Swanton Bomb off the top of the cage. At one point both men were fighting for the door to be opened with Sting getting the effects of it resulting in Karen also attempting to help Jeff with a weapon we haven't seen in a very long time. This isn't a classic cage match but was entertaining.

30 Minute Iron Man Match: TNA Champion Bobby Roode vs. A.J. Styles - Styles came into this match with a bad left leg & heavily relied on ground wrestling like a side headlock so Roode wouldn't be able to target his leg. Roode was eventually able to target Styles' leg which started to show it's effects as A.J. was backdropped at one point but landed on his feet which only hurt his leg more which led to Roode using various stomps & twist & submissions like a single leg crab & figure four by Roode. A.J. was able to catch a break when Roode accidentally rammed his shoulder into the ringpost allowing Styles to work over Roode's arm with his own crossface before Roode was able to go back to the leg turning an armbar by Styles into the legbar. As time went on, both men kept working over their injured areas with punches & kicks with even Styles sacrificing his own leg to execute moves like the springboard twisting crossbody, a flip dive on the floor, armdrag off the top rope via Roode's injured arm, and attempting the Styles Clash with his knee eventually giving out. This was very competitive match with both men telling a story in the ring with the only downfall being the last 10 seconds of the match causing it to end the way it did but don't let that overshadow the 29 minutes & 50 seconds before it as it wasn't a classic but definitely good pure wrestling quality.

Both events had their share of everything from good to great wrestling to entertaining matches & moments with the biggest positive being some fresh faces being inserted into the top of the card & being put over as well. This is a twin pack that's definitely worth checking out.",1496188800,,15272,4.3961796957905905
