Ep65: Go Goku! The Assault Begins / Confront the Red Ribbon Army
Ep66: The Red Ribbon Army's Desperate Offense-Defense / A Real Bind

The Red Ribbon Army: Commander Red Saga continues in the 11th volume of Dragon Ball, with 6 Japanese episodes ending with next episode previews not found on the Funimation releases yet. Real footage, but doesn't change the fact that the audio track is Mono due to Toei Animation sacrificing the original masters at the time. Like always, you pop in the DVD on your DVD/Blu Ray Burner or Region 2 DVD Player, and the first episodes plays automatically. The Marathon Feature is there as Story Mode, without opening and closing credits and previews. Quality still feels like DRAGON BOX sets.",1435968000,,996,4.757225433526012
