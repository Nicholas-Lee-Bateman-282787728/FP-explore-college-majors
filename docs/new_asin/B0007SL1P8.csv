About people who can use paper for ANYTHING....they are biblophiles and paper fell in love with them. They can turn paper into animals, knives, bow an arror....sheild...ANYTHING...the story focus on 3 girls. they have to protect an author after she was held at gun point and strapped down to a bomb...

The only thing bad about the series is it ended...

this only has the box set, the last dvd in the series and an anita action figure...it does not contain all the episodes or dvd's....",1203638400,,515,4.7
