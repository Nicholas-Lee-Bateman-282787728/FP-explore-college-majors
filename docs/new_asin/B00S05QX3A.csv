8696706,5,B00S05QX3A,"First elaborate Documentary about World War One in the East.
If you have seen many docu-films about WW1, and don't want to see another one with endless recycled materials, this is one you should not miss.
About 95 % of the original footage being used in this one, have not been shown in western productions.
Also included are many historical  reenactment's ,with great care to detail and authentisicity, modern and top notch use of CGI effects.
The big battles are made easier to understand with the use of animated battle-table representations. The weaponry from the infantry bayonet to the Battleship, and the first biplane pioneers, is also given time, with some real demonstrations of their effectiveness, on the platform of how TV reality  shows test weapons. Many higher echelon  imperial Russian officers are being portrait and compared to their foes, again in great detail. The effect of internal imperial policies, military and civil, might the viewer help to understand, why the two Revolutions (February and October) happened.
Fraternisation was not only a phenomenon, that happened in the west, it happened even more frequently and large scale in the east. This might be a surprise for the viewer. The coverage of the documentation concludes with the events leading to the October revolution. Another documentary
is forcasted to cover the 1917 Revolutions and the Russian Civil war, in as much detail, as it deserves.
Overall, a documentary that delivers a realistic and involving presentation.",1445731200,2,1506,5.214876033057851
