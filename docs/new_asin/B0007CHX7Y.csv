8046643,5,B0007CHX7Y,I love these videos.  David Suchet is the perfect Poirot and Agatha Christie's plots are always excellent.  They are good enough to be watched over and over.,1391472000,,157,4.777777777777778
8046644,3,B0007CHX7Y,but a must for the Agatha Christie fan who wants to read all of the Great Dame's books.  Just not quite my cup of tea!,1357948800,,118,3.72
