6404443,1,B00K7P69K8,"""Chicks Dig Gay Guys"" is quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made.  This mess tells a tale about two alcoholic friends (Brad and Scooter) who couldn't get laid if their lives depended on it.  Why?  Because who would be interested in dating men who (as often the case is) can think only with one head, are in jobs (that are never quite defined), and whose sole purpose is to drink excessively every night in their never-ending quest for a hookup?  When they find out they are not gonna score, Scooter decides that if he can trick each woman to believe he's gay, then he's in like flint.  And if that will work form him, that just HAS to work for Brad.  Oh boy...

Not only are the characters in this D-rated bomb offensive, so is just about everything else.  Any gay man in this movie is portrayed as your cliched hand-waving, squealing, squawling, mincing, over-the-top, grotesque gay stereotype.  I guess the producer and director thought this would be funny.  Well, it wasn't.  It was a slap in the face to gay culture. These portrayals were so awful, I found it almost impossible to watch this movie.  I will admit my finger was on FF several times.  In fact, ""Chicks"" is so bad, it actually makes ""Tennessee Queer"" seem like ""Gone With the Wind.""

If the gay population wants a movie to march against, I believe I may have found them one.  So do yourself a favor:  SAVE YOUR MONEY or better yet rent something that's worth watching.",1415318400,6,1444,4.517374517374518

8656632,3,B00K7P69K8,"Two guys chase women in bars. Scooter (Nathan Anderson also screen writer) is the ""ugly one"" who tries too hard with bad lines. Brad (Brian Patrick Murphy) is the quiet good looking one the women want, although what he wants is a relationship. When Brad meets Rachel (Maitland McConnell) at a club, he wants her, but she has a boyfriend. Wanting to get close to her he adopts Scooter's gay idea as the group venture out on a camping trip.

 The scenes were not overly crude, yet again they were not overly funny. Okay as a rental.

8656633,3,B00K7P69K8,"It was an ok movie. I wish the DVD would have included deleted senses, outtakes ( a.k.a. gag reel ) and interviews with the cast and crew. Seeing Terri Ivens in a bra and panties for me made the purchase price a bargain. I wish she would have gotten at least as much screentime as she did in Piranhaconda. And to me using the term cougar for her character is insulting. To my way of thinking she more of a sex cat than an over the hill cougar. Mr. Roberts sure is one lucky guy! I wish I would have been the actor playing her husband. Oh one can dream can`t one.",1433721600,,562,4.026785714285714
