8399880,3,B003LWLFZS,"A 2002 horror from China in widescreen/5.1 surround with English subtitles. It starts out good with 3 individuals donating blood to a couple that committed suicide. The boyfriend lives but the girlfriend dies, so the dead girlfriend reeks havoc to those that interfered with there suicide. A great premise, but with the added storyline of whether the female donator is crazy or not just detracted from the main storyline. Seeming it could have been 2 seperate movies. Overall not a bad watch, I'm a big asian horror fan so this is a good keep.",1388534400,,543,4.787234042553192
