8652447,3,B00JMG7O3Y,Good way to have both movies on blu ray. I want the 3d versions as well I guess I'll have to pay more for them. Digital copy does not work in America or anywhere. I've used an app to change my dns with foreign movies and I got them registered and in my ultraviolet and then vudu accounts. Just do it via ultraviolet and even though vudu is only American if your accounts are linked it will appear in your vudu account. Just install dns changer apps. However this movie's digital code did not work with changing my ip/dns to any country/region. It didn't say expired either. It looks like the individual 3d versions of these movies still have unexpired digital xopies.,1493942400,,667,4.475409836065574
