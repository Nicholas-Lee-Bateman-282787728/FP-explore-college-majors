623790,5,6303313337,How could anyone not enjoy this movie.. What did they expect.. DOG DAY AFTERNOON!  It is Hillarious from start to finish. Branden Fraser makes a great lead and Adam and Steve as brothers... What more could you ask for?  The Supporting cast (especially Micheal Richards and Joe Mantegna) are  Great and the music fits well. A damn-fine Comedy.,945216000,3,342,4.862068965517241

623902,3,6303313337,The movie itself is funny and worth buying; but from this seller there's a big drawback movie buffs. There's NO movie menu of any kind. With the original dvd release; there were several extra features to watch. But this particular buy just plays straight through with no scene index menu or anything; its like watching a theatrical bootleg copy. My advice; read carefully the item description of any movie before you buy.,1483228800,,421,4.861111111111111

624183,5,6303313337,"This is a very funny movie. If you're up for a good laugh and lots of goofiness, then this movie is for you. When we watched the movie at the movie theater, I was laughing my butt off, but my wife wasn't. Every goofy moment was a classic. Then when the movie was released on DVD, we watched it again just to go down memory lane and then my wife laughed her butt off. I guess it takes twice around the block to kick start the giggle machine. Anyway, now that this movie is on blu-ray, we decided to jump on it as well. What a funny movie. The PQ is superb as well. If you ever thought of starting a rocknroll band, then this is a good movie and if you just want to laugh and you are hipped to the time period, then this movie is for you. However, if you were born in the 90s and into punk or rap music, recommend staying away. This one ain't for you.",1407196800,,849,3.941860465116279

I was looking at reviews for the movie Encino Man, (another classic) and someone had mentioned what a great cast Brendan Fraser Pauly Shore and Sean Astin were, then I thought an even better trio is Brendan Fraser Steve Buscemi and Adam Sandler. Come on! I didn't buy this DVD here, but I do own a copy and I have seen it many times. I just wanted to leave my thoughts because I love this movie. It's got a funny scenario, memorable lines and a great cast. Plus, if you were a rocker in the late 80s Early 90s you will definitely get most of the jokes and references.",1405900800,7,641,4.262295081967213

624232,3,6303313337,"There are some fun and memorable lines from the movie, but overall it's forgettable. There really is not a whole lot to say about the film without detailing specific scenes. Most of the cast has gone onto bigger and better.  If you are looking for a slacker film to veg out too for an hour and a half, check it out.  The acting is what you would expect from an SNL cameo film.  Brendan Fraser and Steve Buscemi carry the cast.

Low Point - The movie starts to lag a bit before the final climax.",1384128000,,528,4.198019801980198

624305,4,6303313337,"I had seen this movie many times in the past on HBO, and other movie channels, and I like it.  I figured for the price I couldn't complain about it, and even less so at the price of it being new. Don't get me wrong the movie played fine with no flaws while playing, Even with that said the said ""factory sealed"" packaging looked in my eyes to have been re-sealed by an outside of the factory who sold it originally.  Again, don't get me wrong the movie played fine, all the extra features played fine, and all without skipping or stopping. The package of the movie had been broken on the side a small amount, as well as the bottom of the disc appears to have been watched, and not so well taken care of kind of like a movie you would rent from redbox",1378771200,,750,4.13013698630137

624310,3,6303313337,"I got the old DVD of ""Airheads"" the day it came out in 2001. At the time, it felt like it took forever for the movie to finally reach DVD, when looking back DVD had only been commercially available for 4 years at that point, and had only been common for about 2 years. Well, it's now been 7 years since Blu Ray became available, and this time it really has been a long wait, and ""Airheads"" has finally found its way home in HD.

Now, the movie looks and sounds better than it ever has before. It's obvious that the movie didn't have a huge budget, but there is some amazing clarity in scenes that never really showed on DVD, and lots of little things will jump out like never before. (Example: individual toys and things on the shelf when Chazz meets up with Rex at the toy store, various stickers and posters at the radio station, etc.) I popped in the DVD before checking out the Blu Ray and it was evident from the very beginning montage/animations that the picture quality was much better. Crowd scenes in the clubs and bars and outside the radio are pretty clear now, too, to where you can see everyone's face. Little details from the soundtrack jump out.

But now, the bad news. Not only are none of the old extras from the 2001 DVD here (two music videos, trailer, the mockumentary about the Lone Rangers holding up the radio station), there isn't even a MENU. I don't know how it can be 2013 and this disc doesn't have a menu. When I put the disc in, there was a brief mention about how to access subtitles, and the film started. I tried the pop up menu from the remote. Nothing. I stopped playback and came back. Nothing. Unless I missed something, there is no way to access a menu, and the movie just starts. That's pretty barebones.

I wasn't expecting a 20th Anniversary release with new extras, interviews and commentary next year or anything. It's obvious the film only has a small following. If all we have for ""Airheads"" on Blu Ray is the HD film slapped on a disc, then so be it, for now. If you love the movie as much as I do, you'll enjoy how it looks and sounds, at least.",1370217600,7,2092,4.304568527918781

624433,4,6303313337,"People like to claim that critics are irrelevant because they don't always agree with the mass public when it comes to movies. If your average everyday film goer enjoys a movie that the majority of critics panned you'll usually hear them say something to the effect of, ""It's not trying to win an Oscar, what did the critics expect?"" Of course this argument forgets that critics aren't looking for the next award winner, they're simply measuring whether a film is a good or not.

I will admit that some critics do need to lighten up though. Airheads according to Rotten Tomatoes only received approval from 23% of the critics who reviewed it. Now, while the film didn't do quite well at the box office, it has become a bit of a cult hit in the years since. Public opinion shouldn't sway a critic's analysis of a film, but a critic should analyze film based on whether the film accomplishes what it intends to. Of the critics who did approve of the film, I think Peter Travers would agree with me that this film does.

The Lone Rangers, a hard rock/ metal band comprised of Chazz (Brendan Frasier), Rex (Steve Buscemi), and Pip (Adam Sandler), just want a record deal. Chazz tries to solicit a record exec (Judd Nelson) to listen to their demo tape, but to no avail. Finding out that another local band got signed by having their tracks played on the local radio station they try to get local DJ Ian (Joe Mantegna) to play their demo on the air. But when Rex is insulted by station manager Milo Jackson (Michael McKean), they take the station hostage with water guns filled with hot sauce to get their track played.

Is Airheads a perfect movie? Of course not; not by any stretch of the imagination, but that doesn't mean it's not fun. First off, I have to confess that it's kind of fun to go back and watch a movie from a time when Brendan Frasier was a bigger box office draw than Adam Sandler who would start his meteoric rise to superstardom in 1995 with Billy Madison. But if you've ever been in a metal band, or if you know people who have been or are, you probably know or have seen people who are like Chazz, Rex, and Pip. For me this added to the fun of this flick.

It's also interesting how this film plays with the stereotype of the guys who are into metal and hard rock. While often considered dark, brooding, and trouble makers these guys are none of those things. Sure, they take a radio station hostage, but they are not bad guys; after all they're holding the radio station hostage with water guns. There's also an interesting turn in the fact that in taking the station hostage they practically become local folk heroes as the area around the station, and most of their hostages don't want to leave. (As a matter of fact, one of their hostages, played by a blond David Arquette, wants back in after he escapes by mistake.)

There are huge gaps in logic throughout the movie. After they first pull the gun in the station and realize that they're in big trouble and try to escape, why hasn't anyone else left the station? At several points throughout the movie we see the kidnappers Chazz, Rex, and Pip in the studio while all the other hostages are in another room. So if they're not being guarded why don't they make a break for it? And how dumb is a cop to give an automatic weapon to an untrained civilian?! (That's not really a plot hole, just a major gap in logic.) This is one of those types of movies though that uses the outrageous and ridiculous antics of its characters to ratchet up the comedy of the situation.

This critic's going to go against the majority of other critics and say that I highly recommend this film. Is this a favorite of mine? No, but it's a great movie to put on during a rainy day just for a touch of fun. Also, personally, anytime Steve Buscemi's in a film it brightens up the proceedings, even in a horrible movie, which this is not. If you haven't seen it, go watch it. If you have, go watch it again.

3.5/5

624439,3,6303313337,"Oh my, I FEEL like an airhead after watching this movie.

While this film is probably so well-known for featuring a bunch of soon-to-be popular movie stars (or ALREADY stars such as Chris Farley) it's not a particularly funny movie.  It's about three guys who hold up a radio station with a squirt gun.  Of course the hostages don't realize it's a squirt gun or they'd be OUT of there in a hurry.

The three guys are trying to be rock stars, and want the radio station to play their song by forcing them to do so.  Since it's a comedy a bunch of things constantly go wrong for the guys, most of which isn't even funny.

It's a comedy so we won't put too much stock into the things in the storyline that defy logic.  Instead it's important to note that despite being tagged a comedy movie, it's anything but.

Something funny to me is something that makes me, you know, LAUGH.  I didn't laugh hardly at all except for one scene near the end when a tied-up hostage on a chair tried making his escape and a squirt gun to the face was waiting for him.  That was the only funny moment of the entire movie.

The one guy who managed to avoid being a hostage by escaping through the vent system in the ceiling wasn't funny.  In fact his character was entirely pointless, despite crawling through the vents listening in to people and having his own strange adventures wandering through the vent system.

The negotations with the cops could have been funnier too.  There was hardly even any negotiating taking place.

Overall, nah, it shouldn't be considered a classic just because it's an older film now.  All the stars in the movie had better roles in other movies.",1250640000,,1657,4.45514950166113

Steve Buscemi, Adam Sandler, Brendan Fraser, Michael Richards, Chris Farley, David Arquette and many more create this masterpeice.

This is the kind of film you have to watch many times because there are so many hilarious moments that it requires multiple viewings in order to fully grasp all of the humor.

If you haven't seen Airheads, prepare to laugh your head off.",1244678400,,522,4.853932584269663
624441,3,6303313337,"Chester (Brendan Fraser) is living the rockers life... except without the money. Try and try as he might, he just can't get anyone to listen to his demo of his band `The Lone Rangers'. `The Lone Rangers' is a heavy rock band that includes himself, and his two friends who are brothers, Rex (Steve Buscemi) and Pip (Adam Sandler). Taking things into his own hands, Chester decides to sneak into the local rock radio station to see if he can get his demo played there. Mainly because another rock band got their demo played their and became a success. When they won't do it, Rex (who works at a toy store) whips out a machine gun and orders them to play the tape. What everyone (but the band and us) doesn't know is that it's a toy machine gun filled with Tabasco sauce.  They round up everyone working at the station, but what the rockers don't know is that they were on air the whole time, so now the cops have the place surrounded, as well as a huge crowd of `fans'. All they want is their demo played and someone to hear it, to bad they ruin the copy they bring to the station.

After not having seen this movie for many years, I would say it's still pretty darn funny. There were plenty of spots where I still laughed out loud. I'll tell ya what though, Steve Buscemi is a god in this movie. Almost every line he delivers is hilarious and mainly it's because of his sarcastic tone and facial expressions. Also, I know a lot of people who don't like Adam Sandler (why I'll never know), but I think he's pretty funny and actually a good actor in his serious roles. This role though has him playing a smaller part than he's used to now, but he's really funny in this role. The only person I don't care for is Brendan Fraser, but then again I've never really liked him in anything he's played in. Well... cept maybe his role in Scrubs. I liked that role.

In the end I would give this a rent if you want to have some rockin fun.

Chazz Darvey, singer guitarist for ""The Lone Rangers"" (a running joke throughout)has a fight with his beautiful blond but irritated live in girlfriend, Kayla, who has become increasingly digusted that she does all the work and pays all the bills while Chazz is unemployed and unsuccessful in his quest to become a full time musician. After one fight too many she literally throws him out of the apartment and Chazz shows up at the home of bandmates Pip and Rex. Pip runs a pool cleaning service and Rex works in a toy warehouse which has just discontinued a line of water pistols for looking too authentic. Rex confiscates a few water pistols for himself which he plans to use to blast people in the face on his next trip down Hollywood Boulevard. Chazz has other plans and basically decides that if the band can just get three minutes of airplay on the radio it would make a difference in their careers as musicians. The three are unable to get the electronic security door to open and while Rex and Chazz decide to try the roof, goofball Pip is knocked in the head by dumb blonde secretary Suzzi (with 2 z's) who has decided to sneak a cigarette outside the station. After Suzzi goes back inside the 3 manage to stop the door from going shut and they're in. They make their way into the control both where they are greeted by DJ Ian ""The Shark"" and who turns the mic on as they request to be heard on the air. Ian is about to honor their request when the tape malfunctions causing the tape to land in an ashtray instead of the take up reel. The tape is needless to say beyond repair. Somewhere in the midst of all of this confusion, the program director demands that three leave the station immediately and refers to Rex as ""Hollywood Boulevard trash"". Rex pulls the water gun loaded with pepper spray as does Chazz. The water guns look like Uzi's and the radio station panics at a hotage situation, and the band panics realizing they are now not only unemployed musicians but also felons. The police are on the outside of the building trying to negotiate with the ""kidnappers"" and staff and faculty on the inside having a party while Chazz and friends try to figure a way out of this mess. Meanwhile, the station is broadcasting the whole thing over the airwaves all over L.A. to an audience that thinks this is just a publicity stunt. If this sounds ridiculous, it is. It's also funny as Hell. The whole thing finally ends when Kayla shows up at the station with an alternate copy of the demo and record company execs race to sign the band, who wind up making their first album live in prison.
This whole movie pretty much requires that you suspend any belief in anything realistic. If you can accomplish that then you'll probably enjoy this. Cameo by Beavis and Butthead should tell you something about the level of realism herein.

Sandler, Fraser, and Buscemi are all hilarious, and I have seen a lot of their films.  So any musician or any fan of theirs should check out ""Airheads"", a riotous comedy which makes you wonder how far any musician/band will go to get their music out on the market.

Chester ""Chazz"" Darvey (Fraser), Rex (Buscemi), and Pip (Sandler) are three friends in a band who live and work in Los Angeles.  Rex and Pip are brothers.  At the beginning of the movie, we see how far Chazz, Rex, and Pip are going in life.  Chazz lives with his girlfriend Kayla in a small apartment and gets kicked out at the beginning of the movie. Rex works at a toy store.  Pip has his own pool service.  Their band is The Lone Rangers.  Recently, they just recorded their first demo, which they have on both a tape and on a cassette, and they are trying to get their demo played on the radio.  So one day, Chazz, Rex, and Pip go to a radio station in downtown L.A., and after breaking into the station, they meet a radio disc jockey named Ian.  After an argument with both the DJ and the program director, Chazz, Rex, and Pip take the radio station hostage.  And once Chazz, Rex, and Pip have the station held hostage, funny, surprising, shocking, and hilarious events occur.

""Airheads"" is definitely one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  Every single second of this movie is funny, and all of the actors give great performances.  My favorite character would have to be Pip, becuase he is the stupid one out of the gang, and while he is nice to the hostages (at one part of this movie, Rex has to take him in private and train him a little bit so he will appear as tough) out of all the dumb decisions made by characters during this movie, he makes the dumbest decision (wait till you see what that is).

624560,5,6303313337,"A surprisingly good comedy movie thats funnier than it should be that deserves a spot next to Spinal Tap in any metalhead's movie library.  Brendan Fraser, Steve Buscemi, and Adam Sandler star as a band called the Lone Rangers, who determined to get their demo heard, take a radio station hostage with water pistols.  What results is so stupid its hilarious and Adam Sandler is great as the dumbfounded drummer.  The ensemble cast also includes Joe Mantagna, Michael McKean, Chris Farley, Ernie Hudson, Judd Nelson, Michael Richards, David Arquette, and Harold Ramis.  Lemmy Kilmister of Motorhead also makes an appearence as the guy who says he used to be editor of his school newspaper and White Zombie appears in the club scene.",1013472000,2,731,4.967213114754099

But everything falls apart, when the Amateur Band take over The Radio Station and Taken people Hostage from inside the Radio Station.
This film has some moment of laugh out situation comedy here. Fraser, Buscemi and Sandler are fun in this film. Great Rock & Roll music, Directed by Micheal Lehmann (Hudson Hawk, The Truth about Cats & Dogs, My Giant), Dumb fun. Grade:B+.",1011225600,,548,4.840425531914893
624591,4,6303313337,"Yeah, for some people this maybe a little bit strange movie, but at the time i saw it it was right when i was with my band demo looking for radio stations to play it,.. so looking to this guys was like looking to me and my band at that time.
If you are a hard rock musician, or were, you will have a lot of fun looking to this movie, have great stuff and footage, white zoombie playing, Lammie as guest,... the girls, the sound(no grunge and drop dead music, only party rock music),.. have some vein of Waynes World, but a little different. I just don't give 5 star cause im not a professional reviewer, so who am i to give 1 or 5 star?... to finish this is the kinda a movie that every rocker lover want to have like Waynes World collection, Bill & Ted collection, Detroit Rock city or Dont Tell Mom the Babysitter is Dead,.. all rock&roll cool movies.",1006473600,,853,4.175757575757576
624592,5,6303313337,"This movie has been comming on ALOT lately on VH1 and I have sat down and watched it every time! I LOVE this movie!! The story of a rock band holding up a radio station with water pistols to get their song played is a great, hilarious idea! Not to mention, I really dig the station's name. Can I snag one of them t-shirts? I know what it's like to dream of getting a record contract and that makes this movie more enjoyable. While this DVD has no special features which I hate with DVDs, I'll still get it for the movie. 5 Stars for the movie, 1 for the DVD.

624593,5,6303313337,"I know everyone here is thinking that the movie sucks and is only good for a few laughs, but I saw something else. It was meant to be funny, but not all that funny, it was more of a serious flick about three guys living the lives of true rockers. I also loved the truly orignal song they put together, Degenerated, which opens with just drums, then a funky bass intro that blew me away with guitar joining right after. All in all, I loved the movie and think it would be a great way to spend your money.",996451200,,503,4.090909090909091

624596,5,6303313337,"I don't see the point in lying to you all. Everyone else might hate this movie and think it is pointless, dumb, and unbelievably predictable. But when you are an almost fourteen year old and have a fetish for Brendan Fraser's butt? It rocks. The character castings are fantastic, and this movie really pulls you in. I don't recommend it for people over sixteen, though. It's sort of a teenage angst kinda thing. I'd buy it now, but I don't have a credit card. Or any money...",994032000,3,475,4.471264367816092
624597,2,6303313337,"Remember those innocuously awful Disney comedies of the 70's?  That's what this mis-fire feels like even though you won't for a moment think it's a Disney film.  A struggling group of friends who dream of being rock musicians hold a radio station hostage in order to get their demo-tape played.
 It's kind of a Dog Day Afternoon meets Bill and Ted.  They have an interesting premise and a cast that tries hard to be energetic and funny but the situations the writers invent quickly become like a bad situation comedy.  The characters are all unrealistically dumb and there are very few funny lines.  Worse it's all utterly predictable and lacks any kind of sharp satire or edges.  It's not without some laughs thanks in large part to Michael McKean and Joe Mantegna but the comedy is often downright desperately unfunny at times.  Brendan Fraser, Steve Buscemi, Adam Sandler , Michael Richards , Judd Nelson and Chris Farley play one note characters that wear out whatever welcome you are kind enough to give them way before the film is over.  And it's one of those films that believes if it was funny the first time it will be funnier the second and third time.
There's a few laughs, but too few to waste your time on.",978652800,2,1219,4.632558139534884
624598,4,6303313337,"The movie maybe isn't that funny, but its entertaining. One thing that  bothers me about it is when adam Sandler starts talking about rap to try to  be friendly with the two black people that worked in the radio station. You  know just because they are black doesnt mean tehy like rap specially if one  of them played a guitar, there are also very little, but some kids that are  black and like Rock,like the guy from Sevendust or Hendrics fisrt they were  just fans then Rock stars. Anyways more about the movie;as some people  thought it was stupid because of Adam Sandlers character or the idea  thatthey hijacked the station so their music would be heard. I also thought  that some of the acting was sort of stupid but I really enjoyed this movie  because it shows how a three best friends became famous. Also I am proud  that they made a movie about ROCK.And if you want to see a movie about ROCK  this is the one and it is the only one they made. Just another thing I didn't  like is that Motorhead Made a song for the soundtrack with that  wannabe;Ice-T who is a raper and doesnt belong in the soundtrack. Airheads  starts with Brendan Frazer,Steve Buscemy,Adam Sandler,Joe Montegna,Ernie  Hudson,Chris Farley,Michael Richards,David Arquete and featuers a cameo by  White Zombie. And If you have the soundtrack e-mail me and tell me who does  it feature.",968025600,,1361,4.623430962343096
624599,5,6303313337,"Adam Sandler is at his best.  He hasn't played a part so good after this up until Big Daddy.  He is a complete, mindless, idiot...but so darn  loveable.  But unlike his other movies, he isn't a complete moron.
The  funny this is that this isn't even his movie.  No one was the star in this  one.  It was a group effort here, and it worked.  Three guys taking over a  radio station with water pistols just sounds fun.  And boy, is it.
Watch  this movie.  It's not a classic, but you'll like it.",967075200,,493,4.172043010752688

It was enjoyable throughout but it had a horrible plot, below average acting,  typical comedy. I don't think it deserves * * * * *, it deserves * * *! I'm  not that big of a fan of Adam Sandler than I am of Brenden Fraser (he was  great it this movie I might add.) Over-all, it was an enjoyable movie, but  not THAT great.",956707200,,465,3.9148936170212765
