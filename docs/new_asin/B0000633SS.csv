7958217,5,B0000633SS,"Great movie starring NY icon Chuck McCann who was part of N.Y. afternoon tv. Added bonus Rodney Dangerfield, and the Beautiful Ins Balin who starred with Elvis in Charro. This will bring back memories when you used to go to the movie theater. Especially if you grew up in Bklyn or Queens or the NY Metro area. Great Cast and so much fun to watch. Loved it when it played in the neighborhood theatre and delighted to have it on DVD.",1447027200,,431,4.333333333333333

7958221,4,B0000633SS,"Chuck McCann is a multi-talented performer. His zany character in this film
is played to a tee by Mccann. They are not making films today like the
Projectionist! Its a silly but funny movie. Rodney Dangerfield is also in this pic.",1236470400,,230,4.634146341463414
7958222,4,B0000633SS,"THE PROJECTIONIST is hard to categorize-- not exactly a comedy, although there are some amusing things in it, and not a drama as the story deals with the undramatic ordinariness of every day life and what one man does to cope. Perhaps this movie is most accurately described as a comic/fantasy/non-drama.

Chuck McCann stars as an employee of a run-down theater owned by the somewhat tyrannical Rodney Dangerfield (in his screen debut). McCann (the unnamed projectionist) invents a superhero alter-ego named Captain Flash, whom he calls upon whenever the blues, boredom or the boss nag at him. In McCann's daydreams, Dangerfield appears as ""The Bat,"" a villainous Nazi who can only be defeated by the heroics of  ""Flash,"" and theater ushers are Bat's henchmen. These b&w 'B' grade movie serial phantasms seem far more colorful than real life. It's little wonder the projectionist indulges in them as often as he does.

McCann was a supporting player to Alan Arkin in THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER (1968).

7958223,2,B0000633SS,"This was a tough movie to follow, that is why I gave it 2 stars. This movie was a disappointment, it isn`t at all, anything like his other movies. We love Rodney Dangerfield. We collected all his movies thru the years and they were all hysterical. Just for this one. This one just drags on and on. I don`t recommend buying this one. All the other movies with him, are SUPER FUNNY, Typical Rodney Humor!!",1191628800,,403,4.386666666666667
7958224,5,B0000633SS,"There are a couple of film arteests located somewwhere in Calif. who have produced entire epics out of having assembled clips of extant films- dialogue dubbed over. ""The Projectionist"" seems to have been the genesis of the idea (don't know who of people I've discussed obtained legal rights, but who cares? We're only interested in art, correct?).
There are wonderfully inventive sequences of clips in ""The Projectionist"" that are a hoot in their making sense as part of a sequence, but also can't overcome their familiarity to movie fans, so they work on two dimensions.
Also, there is some interesting juxtaposition of clips forming sequences of feelings of standard Mom-Apple Pie-Chevrolet  U.S.A. flag-waving, but they are counterparted by sequences of clips showing the dark side and hypocrisy of the American Dream (myth?). There is the voice of JFK, delivering his most famous line: ""Ask not...(etc.)"", with that audio timed perfectly to sync with Hitler exhorting and gesticulating (No particular disrespect to JFK, I'm sure- just to make the point that Hitler demanded sacrifice to further the dreams of the State, also, and the misguided adventure in Vietnam was very topical at the time of this film's production. At least I think that's what the point is).
This movie also has the wildest use of split-screen, ever.
And the finale harkens to ""The Stunt Man"", i.e., where does the movie begin and where does the part not in the movie end?
Richard Rush, the director of ""The Stunt Man"", says he's excited by pushing the envelope of film syntax. That is really accomplished in ""The Projectionist"".",1040083200,10,1606,5.060377358490566
