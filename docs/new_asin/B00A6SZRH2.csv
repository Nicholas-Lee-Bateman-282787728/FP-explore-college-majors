Dora and Boots find a lost butterfly and together with Diego and friends take the butterfly to the butterfly ball in the sky earning wings.  Cute.,1392854400,,321,4.389830508474576

5384618,5,B00A6SZRH2,"This DVD features 3 Dora episodes for an hour of explorer-fun.  The first episode is ""The Butterfly Ball"" which is about Dora and her friends helping the butterflies and then everyone getting wings.  My boys asked if they could go there and get wings!  The other two episodes are not necessarily about butterflies but still Dora.  One of them is about Father's Day and my boys kept asking about that!  While Dora is not my favorite to watch, it really is an educational show and my kids love to interact with it.  I will say too the quality of the episodes is great and I guess I haven't watched any current Dora episodes, but these episodes are pretty good animation. This would be a perfect Easter gift!

I received this DVD to review in exchange for my honest opinion.",1361318400,12,771,4.503597122302159
