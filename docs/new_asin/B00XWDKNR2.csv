7202072,4,B00XWDKNR2,"For those of you that are fans of The Asylum films, they have definitely come a long way from the early 2000's in regards to their special effects. A big improvement from their first offerings of horror and sci-fi B-Flicks in the early 2000's. Not light years away from where they were but the next town over will do just fine. Anyway, yeah, I know, this movie is a little cheesy but I like the 3 headed shark. Acting was sub par and ok but I love B rated movies. 3 Headed Shark Attack isn't one of their best offerings however my only complaint is that Danny Trejo didn't really have an exciting part. His appearance in this movie was short lived but then again he gets killed off in most of his movies anyway and he's been doing B rated movies for years! Anway, I like the challenge that Asylum tackles by making a pretty good to pretty decent movie. This movie is still entertaining to me and like I said, if you're a fan of these kind of movies then pick this one up.

Rating: I give it 4 stars. Note: I bought the uncensored version so I wouldn't watch this with the young ones around just a heads up for you parents out there.",1438732800,4,1132,4.216589861751152
7202073,2,B00XWDKNR2,"This film is not related to ""2 Headed Shark Attack"" which I considered superior. Asylum and SyFy team up again to create a film to ride on the heels of their own film ""Sharknado 3"" making a ""mockbuster"" of their own production.

This is a mutated shark created by the Great Pacific garbage Patch (there really is such a thing). A research group is attacked at the same time they had a tour group. Extras include a party boat and a heavily armed fishing boat driven by Danny Trejo. Plenty of young girls in bikinis, no nudity, just tease. The film had some dark comedy moments as the human head screaming while inside the shark's mouth and the kid who rode the shark as if he was skiing. The acting was simply bad. No real character build up. The cheese factor needed a bump, a three headed shark isn't enough anymore.",1438473600,,817,4.410596026490066
7202074,3,B00XWDKNR2,I don't see how their are reviews on this since this movie is even out yet!,1438128000,,75,3.75
7202075,1,B00XWDKNR2,"Could they have written a more feckless, hopeless, stupid group of half-dressed ""pretty people"" than the victims of this 3-headed shark?

Attacked by an aquatic killer, every character looks for a way to get into or onto the water. Safe on the land, everyone wants to swim (!) to a boat. Having reached the boat, and with dry land in the background of every shot, they are constantly motorboating while chased by the laughing shark to some rumored ""land"" far away.

Whenever 3 people line up (on the beach, on the rail of a boat, etc), three toothy shark mouths predictably eat them all simultaneously.

I saw it on SyFy with the nudity excised, thereby removing whatever redeeming value was originally included.",1438041600,2,712,4.819672131147541
7202076,5,B00XWDKNR2,"Hilariously awful, a shark movie with too much bite; all the expected components are present and accounted for.  There's skinny dipping, with a blonde used as chum.  AND!!!  This humongous shark can also beach itself to get at land snacks.  That's just the Hors d'oeuvre.  There's an underwater facility that caters to the study of the effect of garbage on sea life.  Science and activism plus a meaningless romance are shoved in at just the right moment when the really big three-headed shark shows up and wrecks the place.  A few people manage to escape, most do not.  They serendipitously find a boat and soon make it to a big paddle wheel party boat packed with plenty of victims.  The shark is not far behind.  Danny Trejo shows up to try and save everyone..........emphasis on ""try.""  Eventually, they come full circle and end up on the island where the three-headed shark first put in an appearance.  Here, they bravely make their last stand (with expected results).

It's dopey, it's fun, it's irrational, cheesy, artless, formidably stupid.............crap by any name.  And yet, I loved it for all that and more.  Bad acting, to be sure, crazy dialog, no doubt, cheap FX, hardly worth arguing about.  It is what it is, a daffy idea that gets in its own way.  Loved it anyway!  And yes, if they want to slap another head on a shark I'd watch it.",1437868800,6,1354,4.665254237288136
7202077,2,B00XWDKNR2,I watched this movie last night on SYFY channel and If it wasn't for Danny Trejo being in the movie I would've given this movie zero stars. sooooo fake and really bad acting.,1437523200,,174,4.303030303030303

7202082,5,B00XWDKNR2,"This was a great bad animal horror movie to add to my collection.  I loved 2-headed shark attack and, obviously, had to have this one!  So many great deaths in both movies.  If you're looking for a bad animal movie with lots of people being eaten, horrid acting and a great chance to yell snarky comments at the screen - this is it!!  Make sure you see this with a bunch of friends and good snacks.  Be prepared for a hilariously horrid (and awesome) fun time movie!",1469145600,,466,4.310344827586207

7202089,3,B00XWDKNR2,3 headed shark was a littl too much,1459641600,,35,3.5
7202090,2,B00XWDKNR2,"I love shark movies, but not this one. Nothing scary about it, no gore scenes, all fake looking (even down to the nude women). It's good to see a shark worried about pollution, but so unrealistic. A waste of time.",1455667200,,213,4.35
7202091,3,B00XWDKNR2,"Yeah, it's okay. Not sure about the Ending. I didn't get why the male character that survived  DID survive since he wasn't much of a ""hero."" The bravest act he performs in the entire movie is to swim out to the boat that originally brought himself and his friends to the Research Facility where he met up with his old flame. The attack by the Three Headed Shark on the Facility having caused the boat to slip its moorings and float away to the ""garbage dump"" (which actually exists, by the way,  The Great Pacific Garbage Patch stretches for hundreds of miles across the North Pacific Ocean, forming a nebulous, floating junk yard on the high seas.  Mostly it's made of all our plastic that we've thrown into our rivers and streams over the years). Anyway, our hero goes to fetch the boat...which he doesn't know how to start. Which means another guy has to swim out to the boat to help him...all this while the shark is circling the area,
In fact, this group are so bad at saving themselves (or anyone else) you begin to think the only thing that COULD save anyone would be for the Three-Headed Shark to commit suicide.

Rent this one...don't buy it unless you're a fan of really badly made movies.
(This clunker makes ""Avalanche Sharks"" look like ""Citizen Kane."" but it's okay to watch once.",1454284800,3,1293,4.536480686695279
7202092,1,B00XWDKNR2,"Horrible acting, horrible theme, horrible breast implants, I can't say enough about how horrible this movie was. I can't believe my eyes didn't bleed watching it. Shaknado deserved an Oscar compared to this movie. That's all!!!",1454112000,,227,5.333333333333333
7202093,4,B00XWDKNR2,"And not because it is much different in style or substance from any other Asylum film. Even if you're not familiar with their work you must know that a film with the title '3 Headed Shark Attack' is going to be a low budget cheesy time waster. But what sets it apart is the acting - not that Asylum films will ever win any awards in this department but in this case the acting is absolutely awful. Seriously. I was laughing out loud in some places and cringing with embarrassment at other times. And the script and direction have to take their share of the blame also. The whole thing screams 'rushed'. There is quite a long scene at the start where a woman is talking to the group about the purpose of her research station and you would swear that she is reading every word off paper in front of her. And a little later three people are looking out to sea watching the shark, and the same woman is looking in a completely different direction to the others. The list of horrors just goes on and on. And The Asylum never seem to learn that you can't create suspense by throwing loud music continuously at the audience. Anyway, all this adds up to a remarkable viewing experience - a film I will definitely keep for a 'bad movie' night. It was worth every cent......",1451779200,,1264,4.360169491525424
7202094,5,B00XWDKNR2,"Nah, this isn't Jaws, Jaws II or even Deep Blue Sea, but what it is, is an excellent B-level monster movie. There is more death and carnage in this movie than I can ever recall in any other shark movie ever. The acting is not great but for a B-level movie it's surprisingly not awful either. Neither is the dialogue or special effects. But yet they are bad enough to let you know you are indeed watching a B-movie. Extremely entertaining an only one or two dull moments. I laughed and screamed at the same time.",1447632000,,511,4.333333333333333

7202097,4,B00XWDKNR2,"Okay, you have to love Asylum's style of cheesy filmmaking to really love this movie.  If you expect Oscar nominations, you will be mistaken.  But if you a corny Jaws on steroids type flick that has laughable horror scenes, this is a fun movie.  And yes, 3 topless scenes in the first ten minutes doesn't hurt.  Seriously, I thought graphically it was better CGI than their earlier stuff.",1444694400,,388,4.661764705882353
7202098,5,B00XWDKNR2,"Loved the movie, Danny Trejo is sort of wasted in this. I wish he would of had a bigger role. I like this franchise and cannot wait for 4 Headed Shark Attack.",1444521600,,158,3.96875
7202099,4,B00XWDKNR2,It is amazing how a 3-Headed Shark Missbehaves through the movie.  Danny Trejo gets eaten by the 3-Headed shark.,1442102400,,112,4.894736842105263
7202100,4,B00XWDKNR2,"Ok..you shouldn't expect Academy  awards from a film with a title like this. You  can't expect top actors. It's a typical shark film. Lots of blood, some  action, people  dying like flies, a minor plot and  little else. So don't  criticize what the film says it is!  My only criticism is they never say where the shark came from; and the end is a little week.",1441324800,2,359,4.348484848484849

7202103,5,B00XWDKNR2,"In the tradition of Sharknado, Asylum and SyFy Channel have created another offbeat and entertaining shark movie.  A group must risk the waters to try to escape the 3-headed shark's wrath.  We get to see WWE/ECW wrestler battle the shark.  We get to see Machete (Danny Trejo) battle the shark with his infamous machete.  We even get to see our favorite mate from down under from Sharknado have a go with the shark.  Plenty of the gore we all come to expect from their films.",1440028800,2,474,4.529411764705882
7202104,3,B00XWDKNR2,"It was not bad, but my main issue was how fake the shrk looked. It was a fun movie though as there really was not much time in between attack scenes to leave you bored, so I will give the movie credit for that and there was alot of good looking girls to keep you interested. The acting was mixed as some was good and some not good. If you like killer shark movies or are a RVD fan though then it is not a bad watch.",1439683200,2,415,3.781609195402299

8716891,4,B00XWDKNR2,"While it's campy and more than a bit corny in a few places this is actually a pretty good movie and a (much, much better) sequel to the ""Two Headed Shark Attack). A science intern and a group of environmentalists are on a research station studying the mutations caused by ocean pollution when the three headed shark attacks and pretty much quickly destroys the station. Chaos ensues as the survivors try to get off the island and stop the shark before it attacks them as well as a party boat. It's campy in a few places but the characters are believable and you find yourself actually regretting those who do get eaten. There's some gratuitous (and really, it's unnecessary) partial nudity for one sequence and the movie can be fairly gory but it's definitely worth picking up and watching over and over. And it does leave you wondering if there's other multi-headed sharks out there and what else has been changed by ocean pollution...And note, one of the characters from the first ""Sharknado' movie is one of the research scientists.",1492214400,,1035,4.7555555555555555
