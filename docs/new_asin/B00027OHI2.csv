8023427,5,B00027OHI2,"This is one of my personal favorite episodes from the RTA series. In it Felicity King must choose which beau she truly prefers. There is the much beloved Gus Pike (played to perfection by Michael Mahonen)who is sincere, hardworking and totally devoted to the King family. And then there is Arthur Pettibone the handsome veterinarian student (played by Zachary Ansley) who likes to rebel against his strait-laced military bred father. After stopping a fist-fight, and then spending time with both men, and much soul searching Felicity comes to a decision. If you are a fan of the show you will applaud her choice. All in all a great episode from beginning till end.",1118880000,2,664,4.884955752212389
