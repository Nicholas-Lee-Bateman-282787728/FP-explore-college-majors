1879142,5,B000094J70,"Very pleased with DVD, music was very nice and compliment the video.  Good for those who can't physically attend fireworks.",1374624000,,123,5.15
1879143,2,B000094J70,"You would think that a video titled ""Fireworks Video"" would contain predominantly fireworks footage.  Even when it takes a break, and shows footage of Truman, Kennedy, Ike, and FDR, shows footage of baseball in its early days, shows footage of the space program, and shows endless aerial shots of trees, ocean, plains, etc., you would think that it would ultimately come back to the fireworks.

Nope.  This is a money grab for those looking for fireworks videos, with cheap music (some good, some ta-cky), and ultimately reminiscing of the days before 1970.  Which would have been forgivable if they simply had more fireworks!!!!",1372896000,8,629,5.077669902912621
1879144,4,B000094J70,"Our family always loved fireworks so it was a huge disappointment when fireworks turned out to be a traumatic event for one of our children who has autism.  We tried to balance the holiday and found this great DVD years ago.  It spans years of American history with a little bit of everything AMERICAN (much like a collage of video to music) and has some wonderful footage of places and news.  Great to reminisce!

The fireworks display isn't the best but it is set to music (23 tunes of varying types: traditional, pioneer, etc.) and the DVD has a wonderful spirit which brought 3 generations of joy while watching.  Perhaps younger generations could have used more information.  (there are 23 tunes while you move through our American history and America.",1278201600,4,757,4.7846153846153845
1879145,5,B000094J70,"Excellent video. I recommend watching this video for the upcoming fourth of July. I may be in Iraq, but it's good to have an American feeling that we're protecting our freedom back home. God Bless the USA!!!!",1214870400,4,208,4.648648648648648
1879146,1,B000094J70,"I guess I can't be too disappointed cuz I only paid $12. The fireworks are not a world class display like seen in most major cities. They are so-so and not even a full show. The audio is fake. The music is not chorographed to fireworks.

If your thinking of buying this for the fireworks. DON'T. Buy the Nova special on fireworks. They show all about fireworks and follow the July 4th show in Boston. One of the best around!!!",1184544000,8,426,4.325
7989321,1,B000094J70,"I wished I could say I was inebriated when I purchased this, but alas, no. I wanted to watch a video of some HD quality firework displays since most of the cities are now opting out of doing firework displays. I had better luck on YouTube. The 1-click purchase option is very dangerous. Thanks Amazon!",1483142400,2,301,4.490909090909091
7989322,3,B000094J70,was not what i expected was going to take to nursing home but it did not fit I thought there was going to be straight fireworks for them to watch,1469232000,,145,3.8666666666666667
7989323,1,B000094J70,This video won't even download to your computer. It's useless to purchase it. I want a refund and I will find the video elsewhere.,1465084800,,130,4.458333333333333
7989324,4,B000094J70,This is a good video alternative to the real thing to create some ambiance for the occasion if you can't or don't want to go out.,1447891200,,129,4.0
7989325,1,B000094J70,"Not in HD, repetitive scenes, and don't buy if you expect there to be any history lesson - just graphics. I could have made my own damn video!",1435968000,,142,4.107142857142857
7989326,4,B000094J70,I got this to watch with my kids for the 4th of July.  It was pretty good.  Some of them lost interest when it started to move from fireworks displays to history clips but I thought it was well done.,1418774400,,199,3.95

7989328,2,B000094J70,"I was expecting more actual fireworks than this title provides. There are some good fireworks, but there is too much ""historic"" information and pictures of selected politicians.",1412035200,2,177,5.592592592592593
7989329,3,B000094J70,Fireworks could have been better.  The other video clips and history information was really nice.,1406937600,,97,5.466666666666667
