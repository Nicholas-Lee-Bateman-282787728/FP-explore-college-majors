4470406,5,B004UR1RBK,"The Tenant reminds me of the classic ""B"" movies when I was a kid. The movie is scary, corny and done perfectly! I say grab a bucket of popcorn, snuggle with your honey and get ready to be startled, moved and shocked. It's in my que and should be in yours too!",1309910400,,259,4.0

8442084,1,B004UR1RBK,"A friend of mine is in this so I gave it a look....wow.  She said it was bad but I was hoping for that ""its so bad its good, maybe even funny"" feel.  Not even close.  What a colossal turd.  I should have been paid to watch this.",1402444800,,228,3.6875
8442085,4,B004UR1RBK,Product arrived on time and in great condition but I have not watched this DVD yet so I cannot comment on the content of this film.,1398556800,,131,4.076923076923077
8442086,1,B004UR1RBK,"The acting was mediocre.  And how is it that the red-headed nurse looks exactly the same almost 30 years later?  And the plot was totally predictable.  Can I have my $3.99 and two hours of my life back, please?",1358640000,,210,4.333333333333333
8442087,3,B004UR1RBK,This movie was ok. It set you up to think it was going to be something really good then out of nowhere it deflates. Very predictable and somewhat dumb. Not worth the price of rental. Should be .99cent,1357948800,,200,4.2894736842105265
8442088,5,B004UR1RBK,This movie is amazing. Whoever gave this movie less then 5 stars obviously is not a horror fan. Two thumbs up for the scariest film ever,1342224000,,136,4.269230769230769
8442089,1,B004UR1RBK,"(1.) No subtitles and poor, inconsistent audio levels makes it challenging to follow the dialogue which turned out to be generic Hollywood speak anyway.
(2.) Usual  mad scientist operating an asylum/sanatorium while looking for a cure for disease and ends up with a deformed patient (resembles Proteus syndrome often associated with ""The Elephant Man"") that doesn't take kindly to strangers. This nasty patient (holding up in the, now closed, asylum)  turns out to be his own son after his wife was injected with this supposedly curative drug.
(3.) Strangers, of course, and in this case vulnerable young adults traveling in the usual van, with the usual breakdown with the usual rainy day with the usual ""no reception cell phone"" plot line that is so over used there are web sites that cite all the movies that use it. Usual victims can't seem to make intelligent decisions and find escaping a Hollywood fantasy.
(4.) Yes, a few unluckies die but you don't really see that. Cost too much. A few escape - too bad.
(5.) This movie says a lot about the intelligence of many Floridians in that in the ""Special Thanks Credits"" is a shout-out for this educational film's financing to: ""Governor Charlie Crist and the Florida Legislature for Financial Incentive"". Money well spent! Think how much more educated Floridians are now on the benefits of killers in asylums! Speaking of promoting, I understand that his replacement had an equally embarrassing faux pas while touring Spain on ""official"" business.",1338076800,5,1500,5.020080321285141
8442090,1,B004UR1RBK,"This movie reeks and the other reviews must be ""top-loaded"" by people with a financial stake in the DVD.  Stupid story, horrendous screenplay, atrociously bad direction and bland zombie-like acting.  Avoid like the plague.",1315785600,3,222,5.5
8442091,3,B004UR1RBK,"A teen couple waits outside what appears to be a home, but is actually an abandoned mental institution. They wait for a woman to show up and undo the padlock on the outside of the door. They want to make love in the building. They go in and get slaughtered. Cue credits. We are now 28 years earlier. Randy Molnar plays Walter, a doctor at the sanitarium. He is doing unauthorized genetic experiments. His wife, who is pregnant with twins, (girl and boy) wants him to stop. Michael Berryman plays a cannibalistic inmate, or ""tenant"" as the doctor calls them, from whom Walter extracts fluid for his experiment. A nurse, a rival to the wife, wants Walter to continue with his experiments. Got the plot figured out yet?

We now go back to the present. A van, carrying deaf mute girls has trouble in front of the abandoned asylum...with no cell phone reception due to the rain. One of the girls grew up near there and looks a lot like the aforesaid wife. They break in and...

This has all been done before, except for maybe the deaf-mutes, which didn't really add anything to the story. Had we not seen these other films, this one would have been fine, even if it was grossly predictable. When the baby is born, the nurse proclaims, ""It's alive!"" Yes, we know it's alive and we can even tell you how it is going to end up. Overly predictable.",1313798400,,1339,4.461224489795918
