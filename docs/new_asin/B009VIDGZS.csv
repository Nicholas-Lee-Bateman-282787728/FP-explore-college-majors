5369095,5,B009VIDGZS,Through out history it has been the obscure person of priciple that has been the agent of change. Can I die to my self and be planted so others could be free? There are more layers to this story still to be told. I hope they will. I pray more Christians return to the Orthodoxy of what it means to follow Christ.,1401494400,6,312,4.048387096774194
5369096,5,B009VIDGZS,"I loved this movie, because it showed the real life sacrifices that people made for us to be the society that we are today.  We have a long way to go still, but seeing how far we've come is a great inspiration to keep pressing on!",1389484800,8,230,4.0
5369097,5,B009VIDGZS,"This is the story of Koinonia Farm. And though you've likely never heard of the farm itself, you've almost certainly heard of Habitat for Humanity, which got its start here, with the people of Koinonia.",1366243200,,202,4.8

5369099,5,B009VIDGZS,I must have head my head in the sand to miss this vital and influential mission of Clarence Jordan and the impact of Koinonia Farm. I was old enough in the 60's and supported MLK but this just didn't make the 6 o'clock news. I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary of a revolutionary spirit of justice and equality.,1439856000,,313,4.508771929824562

5369103,5,B009VIDGZS,"I stumbled upon this moving documentary quite by accident.  Such a beautiful story of what one person with one idea can do to change the world.  Had my mother not decided to move from Louisiana to California in the early 1940's, as a child born in 1952, I would have grown up at near ground zero of the civil rights movement.

Funny how the history books only include what they want us to know.  I had never heard the story of Koinonia Farm until I saw this documentary.  How beautiful to know that the Habitat for Humanity program got its roots at Koinonia.  I'm thankful every day that I choose to see people as individuals, rather than a race.  This is a moving documentary of what Christ charges us all to do - love one another as I have loved you.",1419292800,5,752,4.290780141843972

8544510,5,B009VIDGZS,"Yes, we've come a long way, haven't we???  It is still astounding that humans can choose to love or hate other humans.  But for the Grace of God, we could be in the cast of hater. .  What determines our attitudes, our judgments?  What brings change from hatred to love or conversely love and trusting to despising?  This is a great documentary of real people in our time.  The teachings of Jesus still out-shine all others which have not the same Light and Love",1455580800,,461,4.428571428571429
8544511,3,B009VIDGZS,"I really enjoyed this and was informed of an amazing group of people that were pushing for Civil Rights before anyone else. What made the story lose points was the aspect of organized religion woven into the society. Although they didn't push it too much, it still feels a bit cult-like to me. I love the idea of a community banding together for a common cause, but religion always appears to be the backbone of these groups.",1447718400,,425,4.532467532467533
