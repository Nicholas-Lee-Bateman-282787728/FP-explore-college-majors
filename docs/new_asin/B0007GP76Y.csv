8047456,5,B0007GP76Y,I grew up watching Fraggle Rock at 7am every morning before school.  I ordered this for my niece and nephew but they just did not get into it like I did.  So I took the dvd back and watched it and love it all over again!,1421539200,,220,3.760869565217391
8047457,4,B0007GP76Y,"Recently, I was clearing my parents house out and found a box of old toys, including a bunch of Fraggle dolls that I had as a kid. When I mentioned this to my sister, she said she heard that Fraggles were making a comeback with a new movie coming out. Sure enough, when I checked Amazon, the complete series was available. It was such a joy to see this again. This is a great show for kids (or nostalgic adults). The puppetry is great. The show is very musical, but the songs (by and large) aren't corny or annoying. Some of them are actually a bit tender. The episodes often deal with themes like prejudice and the environment.

8047460,5,B0007GP76Y,"The quality of the image was fantastic. It was actually sharper than I remember the actual program transmission.

The shipping and quality of the DVD were outstanding. not a single wavering or bobbling pixel. The sound and quality of the music was extraordinary.

I was actually dazed and amazed -- also very pleased. Hope future offers of Fraggle Rock are as good.

I'm not only over 13, I turn 65 next week . . . and I ordered this for myself. Well, I'm gonna let my grandkids watch 'em too.",1127520000,9,493,4.455555555555556
8047461,4,B0007GP76Y,"I am so happy for the release of Fraggle Rock on DVD.  I was also very excited to see an ad inside the DVD case stating that they are coming out with a First Season Box Set this fall!!

The Fraggle-Oke is fun!

The bonus episode is about Jr. Gorg going on a search to find a friend while the Fraggles try to steal his favorite radish.  I don't know the name of it.  It is fun answering the trivia questions to get to the locked episode.",1114646400,9,436,3.9655172413793105
