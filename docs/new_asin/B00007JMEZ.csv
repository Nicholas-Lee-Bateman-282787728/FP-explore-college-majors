7976862,5,B00007JMEZ,The movies were on time and in great quality. The surprise I had was due to the set not claiming Full/Wide screen Format unless calculated from measurements. Due to the pics taken it appeared to duplicate the widescreen version shown in the selling ad. I preferred the cheaper price of buying both together and wished they were available in widescreen. I settled for what was available to satisfy my impatience. Thanks anyway. Tom.,1387929600,,431,4.917808219178082

7976864,5,B00007JMEZ,I think this is the best cause you get both movies together,1049068800,5,59,4.0
