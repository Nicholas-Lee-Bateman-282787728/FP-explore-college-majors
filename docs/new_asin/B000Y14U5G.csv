8413995,4,B000Y14U5G,"The only part of this DVD that I did not like was that you could not hear Charles Tomlin quite clearly as the show seemed to have been recorded with a camcorder, which picked up the sound from the audience and the echo in the room. However, if you look pass this, you will fully enjoy this DVD. During most of the show, Tomlin tells a story based on true life events to get to the or to make a point; whenever he gets there, it is almost guaranteed that you/his audience will end up laughing hard. In addition, there were some jokes that made you laugh until you shed tears. Overall this was a great DVD; but if the quality was better, it would probably be considered one of the best DVDs. I would recommend this DVD to anyone.",1198368000,,727,4.2
