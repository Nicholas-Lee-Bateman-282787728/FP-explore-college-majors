8271271,5,B0018WFOGE,"this is one of the best beginner's lesson in argentine tango in my opinion compared with the half dozen tango videos i have.  this starts from the basic to intermediate which is the best value so far. i have doubts before i bought this video since it is being taught by a non hispanic teacher but i was impressed by how the lessons were taught which in some respects are better taught compared with the other videos produced from the tango capital of the world, buenos aires.  i have lessons taught by real argentinians though some are really good, the language barrier is the stumbling block because of the voice over in english which sometimes does not jive with the actual demonstrations. by the way you may be surprised to find out that the photo of chris morris on the cover of the video is not the same when you view this video because i did not recognize him with his beard, he does not look clean-cut anymore but he is a terrific teacher. the lessons here are authentic argentine tango and chris morris's lady partner is also a terrific tango dancer. do not be misled by other videos made by non hispanics which purports to be argentine tango when it is really not such as the one made by kathy blake which is really american tango. i highly recommend this video.",1301356800,,1271,4.474137931034483
