8217985,4,B000NQRTX2,"This movie is in Mandarin with English subtitles (if you turn on closed captioning in your settings). The plot is somewhat like a Romeo and Juliet story with a mythical twist. The title Scimitar is a half moon shaped sword/knife. In this movie it is a weapon even though farmers normally use it to chop weeds or soft branches.

The story starts with a young man who wants to fulfill his father's dream, who passed away, to be the best swordsman based on his father's family kung fu manual. However, one day he was deceived and his manual was stolen. An opponent used the stolen manual to learn how to defeat the young man, thus, the young man lost his title of being the most skilled swordsman as this opponent was one of his last that he needed to defeat. Devastated by this lost, he decided to commit suicide only to be saved by a young woman from another world, a Fox clan that lives in a magical place between the dead and the living. This woman is an expert fighter who uses the scimitar, except hers has a blade that can split into two half moons. She tells him of how her aunt once fell in love with a male human, and when he left, he promised her he would return, but never did. Her aunt waited years and died heart broken a year ago. This new couple goes through a similar experience with him promising never to leave the Fox clan after marrying her. However, after she teaches him how to fight with the scimitar and let him know he would be more powerful than any human, he suddenly feel the need to return to the human world to prove himself. He requested her to leave with him, but leaving would risk them being killed or banished by the Fox clan as humans are not normally allowed to travel freely between the two worlds. He must choose between his marriage or his reputation. If she decides to leave with him, she must choose between her husband or her family/clan.

The wife risk everything to be with him and becomes his protector and rebuilds his reputation in the human world. What will become of him upon being a supreme swordsman? Will power overrun his mind and love? Will he be a modest man and be satisfied, or have a constant appetite for more power? Will his love for his wife last? What next once you have it all?

Story is okay and fight scenes are pretty well choreographed. This is a love story between two people from different worlds with action fight scenes and a question on human nature/morals.",1524182400,,2428,4.391111111111111
8217986,4,B000NQRTX2,"The ending is a little bit weak. Otherwise, it is a quite nice movie when considering it is in the 70s.",1513468800,,103,3.9523809523809526
8217987,4,B000NQRTX2,"I remember watching this in the theater back in the late 70's. Pretty good wuxia movie for the times. For the idiots who gave 1 or 2 stars because they said there were no subtitles. There are English subtitles. You need to go to the settings and turn on the subtitles,",1510704000,,268,4.2745098039215685
