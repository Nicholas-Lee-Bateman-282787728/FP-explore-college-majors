 Would have liked more content rather than so many repeats, so many awesome classic CCR songs not included but still VERY ENJOYABLE !
These are songs that bring back so many memories, I was too young to have gone to a concert so this DVD took me to several !
PLEASE KEEP IN MIND, this DVD is grainy, no such thing as ""HD"" back in those days, regardless, I give it FIVE STARS !",1407369600,,409,4.049382716049383
8373939,5,B002MLIQI8,"81 minute DVD consists 18 tracks via 3 sections: ""Clips"" (6 tracks), Royal Albert Hall 1970 (6 tracks), and Oakland Arena 1970 (6 tracks).

""Clips"" are actually various TV and concert performances.  The songs appear in their entirety.  They are:

Down On The Corner, Bad Moon Rising, Proud Mary, Looking Out My Back Door, I Put A Spell On You, Sweet Hitch-hiker, I Heard It Through The Grapevine.

Sound and video quality varies but sounded mostly quite fine to me.  No, it's not an HD or Blu-Ray experience.  Bear in mind the era the video is culled from.
But for simply enjoying odd clips of the band playing their songs in what must be some otherwise rare video footage, it's not bad and looks like something you'd have seen on 1070s TV.  The clips section has noticably better sound quality than both of the 2 concert footage selections that follow.

Those are:

Royal Albert Hall 1970 (6 tracks: Born on the Bayou, Green River, Traveling Band, The Midnight Special, Proud Mary, Keep On Choogling)

and Oakland Arena 1970 (6 tracks: Traveling Band, Bad Moon Rising, Proud Mary, Fortunate Son, Commotion, Keep On Choogling).

Perhaps Royal Albert has better sound of the 2 though audience noise is sometimes overloud to the point where it seems to occasionally drown out the music on a couple occasions.  The Oakland show doesn't have great sound either - it's more ""tinnny"" than Royal Albert.  In any case, you certainly recognize the songs but the visuals are what make things interesting.  Audience footage is great. So is seeing the band. Oakland Arena.. does that mean Oakland Collesium?  Kind of looked like it.

There's some bonus including interviews and a few more tracks.

All in all it's a fair chunk of vintage Creedence material.  I give it 5 stars for rare footage value, not for sound quality.  Video material is pretty exciting while sound quality won't offend those used to bootlegs.  It's a step up from that.",1364169600,13,1930,4.787878787878788
