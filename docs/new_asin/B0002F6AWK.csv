2090657,5,B0002F6AWK,"Very well done fantasy, good for kids and adults, as well. The scene where the little girl sees the stallion in the company of Fergus and the dog is breathtakingly beautiful and worth the price admission all in itself. We watched these few minutes over and over again.",1201910400,7,268,4.604166666666667
2090658,5,B0002F6AWK,"I ordered this movie on a whim and I was not disappointed.  It is well done and has a pleasant story line.  It is clean and interesting, which makes it excellent for the whole family to watch.",1196467200,22,192,4.162162162162162
2090659,5,B0002F6AWK,this movie was wonderful and i would recondmind it for every one that loves horses and animals. i cried because it was very moving and it reminds me of me and a horse that i once had in fla. before i moved to arkansas and it is very emotional and up lifting for all ages.,1126742400,28,271,3.9454545454545453
2090700,5,B0002F6AWK,This movie stimulates dreams and is great for all horse lovers.  We have watched it many times and still enjoy it,1393545600,,113,4.380952380952381
2090701,4,B0002F6AWK,"We have all seen more than our share of ""horse films"". This one is special because it is a good family film as well as a magical an smewhat mystical film which tells a tale that has those qualities and is truly good for all ages. Good acting always determines how well I enjoy a film and the acting in this is very well done and I must say the entire story could really happen, it is not just a fable on film.  And it is also good for all ages.",1393027200,,444,3.879120879120879
2090702,4,B0002F6AWK,"I enjoyed watching this movie on the television. Thought it was heart-warming , the acting was good, and I especially enjoyed the older gentleman named Fergus....The whole family can view this movie.... The scenery is beautiful...It is a cute movie and good from beginning to end.. I had to add this movie to my collection...",1390953600,,325,4.927272727272728
2090703,2,B0002F6AWK,"Just the name should be enough to forewarn you.  Beautiful horse, feel-good plot, romantic music.  I know I may be being a wet-blanket here, but how many people would make a movie about a young teen who doesn't know how to drive suddenly falling in love with a race car, deciding to take it for a spin, and the car magically bonding with its teen driver?  Most people would think that's way too dangerous a message to send to kids.  Yet we have all these movies about kids magically bonding with stallions.  I'm an adult; I've worked with horses for almost 40 years and I don't even keep a stallion, especially not a wild stallion.  I've seen a stud almost come over a 6-foot fence trying to fight with another young stallion.  Wild horses are beautiful and awe-inspiring....but don't give a child the idea that ""taming"" a horse is something magical or easy.  There ARE horses who tame easily,  but most take time and experience.  At least the old man in this movie tries to warn the girl that trying to ride this horse would be dangerous.  You'd never get on a wild horse's back, and if you did, that'd be the shortest ride in history.",1382227200,,1136,4.466019417475728
2090704,3,B0002F6AWK,Okay family movie.  Liked that it was placed in another country as it gives me insight how they live elsewhere.,1381363200,,111,4.55
2090705,5,B0002F6AWK,"This is just the perfect family movie. Beautifully filmed in Scotland, it has the right blend of slightly-rebellious-but-good-hearted teenager, impatient-but-loving widowed father, sweet old man, kind housekeeper with an even kinder son, villans who are not too scary but not too unbelievably idiotic, and beautiful Scottish Highland creatures who make me want to travel to Scotland in hopes of getting at least a glimpse of them. I love this movie, I bought my own copy, and I hope you will, too.",1379116800,,497,5.148148148148148
2090706,5,B0002F6AWK,I can't review it  as I have not received the DVD as of today. I can state that I have seen in on tv and really liked it and that is why I purchased it.,1375315200,,152,3.342857142857143
2090707,3,B0002F6AWK,"I like the fact about the older man who loved being with animals more than other humans. The girl wanted so much to try to help him and save the mystical horse from poachers. Those poachers would snatch up anything, wild or tame. I just wish there had been more horse action.",1364169600,,275,4.3076923076923075
2090708,5,B0002F6AWK,Definetly deserves a 5 star rating! This was a Christmas present for our 5 yr. old granddaughter who is into horses  big time! She loves this DVD so much she watches it 2 or 3 times a week! Highly recommend it for all the little cowgirls out there!,1357862400,,248,4.166666666666667
2090709,5,B0002F6AWK,"This is a wonderful story! Appropriate for all ages.  Well acted and, of course, the horse is beautiful.  Highly recommend!",1356998400,,123,5.1
2090740,5,B0002F6AWK,"I love this.. I love anything with horses.... I'd recommend this for all ages,,,,,,,,,,,,,.....
Such a pretty horse and great story...",1353801600,,134,5.428571428571429
2090741,1,B0002F6AWK,"Even my grandchildren who are 9 and 7 found this movie too simplistic and naive.  The adults had a hard time not to make derogative remarks.  Nice scenere, but terrible acting and story plot.  The girl's behavior towards her father was not a good example to show children.",1347494400,,272,4.625
2090742,2,B0002F6AWK,"Yeah, family friendly, but if you're an adult watching it while babysitting, you can't really understand why the adults are so useless in the movie. Someone steals the hermit's animals and goes to make them into food/furs, and he just lets them. The bad guys hit him with a car, and apparently that translates to ""Well, he's old, so naturally he's having issues."" The poachers kidnap the girl, and the cops and her dad just stand there like idiots. The horse is pretty, but you can see he has mane extensions in several of the shots so it looks a little bizarre. I know it's supposed to be for kids, but why do these kid movies with horses always have the village idiots? Can't they write anything decent anymore and stop hoping all we're looking at is there's a horse in the movie?",1339027200,,782,4.475524475524476
2090743,4,B0002F6AWK,"If you're looking for a kid-friendly movie, this will probably fit the bill for you. The story line is easy to follow and is neither too involved nor intense.

Without giving away too much, the plot involves a divorced man's spirited daughter whose mother has passed away. The daughter moves overseas to live with her dad. Their relationship is rather strained because of misunderstandings on both parts.

A couple of bungling outlaws and a kindly old man add to the story. And then there's the mysterious horse...

I doubt adults will be enthralled with this movie, but it's a cute story for kids.

BOTTOM LINE: Buy the DVD, make some popcorn, and enjoy this kid-safe movie with your children/grandchildren...just don't expect to be on the edge of your seat.",1338422400,,759,4.8604651162790695
2090744,5,B0002F6AWK,This is a good movie for people of all ages. No worries of foul language as there isn't any. All will enjoy it.,1312588800,,111,3.869565217391304
2090745,1,B0002F6AWK,"I'm very disappointed because I never received the DVD... instead
of making the offer good and sending another copy they said they
would refund my money!  I haven't received it yet...",1306540800,,183,4.903225806451613
2090746,4,B0002F6AWK,"I was concerned how our 6 year granddaughters would react to the takers.  After hiding behind the furniture during the first viewing, they watched it many times since and love it all the way through.",1300233600,3,199,4.685714285714286

2090748,3,B0002F6AWK,"Princess Stallion------it had the potential of being a great movie--the story was fine--but the acting was so-so-,The stallion (which was a beautiful horse by the way)who lives in the forest and was supposed to be wild --actually had shoes(A big no no)he's WILD--the animal trappers----were getting under my skin (I wanted them gone)---and the father to the girl was just so disconnected to the whole story---when your little girl is telling you a story about something so huge you listen and go check it out-- instead he basically called her a liar--and the older gentleman up the hill-----(but) over all my husband and I sat and watched it--we loved the scenery--we loved the horse--the old man was probably the most fitting to his character--if the director could have worked more diligently with the characters --made it more believable--more enchanting-- more magical--get rid of the trappers--work on mending the dad and daughter --and making that more realistic---this movie would have been great---if you got little kids running around it might hold their attention span--but highly unlikley--maybe suitable of grabbing the attention of a young pre-teen who wants and loves the whole horse thing--It was a Great Popcorn movie---not 1 bowl but 2(haha)--my husband and I will give it a thumbs up for making it a family movie--a nice change from all the garbage people watch today (killing, slashing, raping, swearing, blood all that rott etc...) I believe we will sit and watch this movie again--with another bowl of popcorn ;^)",1286755200,11,1534,5.164658634538153

8027653,5,B0002F6AWK,"This is a very enjoyable, family-friendly movie about a young girl and horses.  From the time she was a kid in Los Angeles, she's had a vision of the ""Princess Stallion"", spurred by a child's tale about a mythical stallion.  When she's sent to Scotland to live with her father, she finds that stallion.

Lots of lovely scenery, a nice story, a tale that involves father-daughter problems, love of nature, horses and more.  It's a shame this one is no longer available.",1427414400,,468,4.670731707317073

8027661,4,B0002F6AWK,"Lovely story for kids and young adults. If the adults are horse and animal lovers they will enjoy it as well. Its from Great Britian so it has more of their spin on the story, mythology and protection of wild creatures.

Filmed better than most  horse or animal stories aimed at younger age groups.",1401148800,,298,4.5
