If you've been fortunate enough to experience it... congrats (buy a dvd and refresh those intimate memories) .. if you haven't been that fortunate.. BUY THE DVDs ... get one of each for you and the ones you love and want to 'travel' with you!!!

This graphic filming is inspiring .. you can actually hear the calving glacial ice SLAM into the water from 100s of feet above .. Narration educates you about facts of glaciers (their colors, sheer mass, life cycles, etc) and Alaska ... background music will add to your personal experience while viewing ...

8342249,2,B001TOWIX8,"For me, the narrator's voice was tough to listen to for any length of time. I tried muting and turning on the captioning function, then decided I wanted to hear the glaciers calving--only to find that sound to be overshadowed by unnecessary music. I fast-forwarded and enjoyed some of the footage, then tried listening a bit more but eventually gave up. I love documentaries about Alaska; unfortunately, this is not one I will be revisiting.",1509494400,,441,4.8933333333333335
8342250,3,B001TOWIX8,It was okay in the sense that message was more important than the medium. Version I saw looked to be standard definition. Narration was cumbersome and amateurish  - could have used a lot of script editing. At some points came off as a film school project. Lacked polish and visually quality is below what one would expect.,1484697600,,322,4.649122807017544

This movie was skillfully filmed and exquisite in detail.  The kids watched it as avidly as I did.  Best of all, the kids (and us) learned about iceburgs and Alaska - makes us want to go there to visit.  Definitely recommend.

8342256,1,B001TOWIX8,"I cannot believe this video had a five star rating. I feel ripped off.
Here's why:
-All the footage appears to have been shot using a home movie camcorder.
-They talk about how amazing glaciers sound when they crack...but you never hear it because the sound quality is so bad. And on top of that there's super annoying tourists yelling ""whoo hoo!"" ""Yay!"" in almost every shot. Gets old fast.
-Terrible soundtrack. Generic filler drivel.
-Poorly written narration.

Watching huge chunks of glacier fall into the ocean IS pretty cool--but the sound, image, and music quality are so bad that this film was actually painful to watch.",1322524800,,629,4.878504672897196
8342257,5,B001TOWIX8,"This DVD of Alaska was given to me by a friend as a gift and although I was weary at first, the DVD was actually very informative and fun. It's not like one of those boring educational films in the class room. This is much more in-depth.",1305504000,,237,4.0638297872340425
