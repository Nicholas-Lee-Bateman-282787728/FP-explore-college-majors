2292105,4,B0009I8QGI,"IN MY COUNTRY (COUNTRY OF MY SKULL), based on a book by Antjie Krog about South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) of 1996  set in the aftermath of Apartheid, has been altered by screenwriter Ann Peacock and director John Boorman who have elected to 'dramatize' that event by fleshing out 'committed journalists' on both sides of the color fence: South Afrikaner Anna Malan (Juliette Binoche) and American hothead Langston Whitfield (Samuel L. Jackson).  The dichotomy of the white/black reconciliation is thus reversed; Anna is white defending the South African blacks while Langston is black firing his vitriol against the white South Afrikaners.

The story is immensely important to tell: 21,800 blacks were tortured and killed in the final days of Apartheid, but in the wisdom of South African philosophy the perpetrators are given amnesty if they confront their crimes and show remorse.  This noble morality is the single most touching aspect of this story.
During the Commission hearings all reporters hear the grief of the victims' families and are stunned.  Though initially hostile to each other, Anna and Langston gradually are able to listen to each other's perspectives and become romantically involved (both are married with children) and as the film ends the affair is ended in keeping with the example of the  truth the TRC has established.

In an attempt to make this reality into a movie the impact is dulled by the Hollywoodesque treatment.  Yes, Binoche  and Jackson are fine actors (as is Menzi Ngubane who plays a wholly loveable South African instigator), but the melodrama they are forced to enact is superficial and does not add to the otherwise powerful message of this film.  This is a movie that deserves the attention of a wide audience.  Just pay more attention to the facts than to the soupy frosting under which it plays.

2292106,3,B0009I8QGI,"John Boorman's (""Deliverance"", ""The Tailor of Panama"") ""In My Country"" is based on the book ""Country of My Skull"" by Antjie Krog, which was based on a true story. Sadly though many many people are going to overlook this very important movie.

 The film follows the 1996 Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings in which amnesty was given to those who committed acts of human rights abuse under the apartheid.

 The movie focuses on two journalist, one white African, Anna Malan (Juliette Binoche) and a black American, Langston Whitfield (Samuel L. Jackson). Anna believes in the hearings while Langston does not. This leads them to bicker. She feels he does not understand her country, he feels she does not understand what it means to be black. Both are probably right.

 In the beginning of the movie I was captivated, mostly because what we see is based on fact. I thought the movie was going to speak to the human spirit while showing us images of a truly horrific nature. I suspected the movie was also going to pull on my heartstrings. And at first it did. But then the movie has to try and overcome the flaws it has set-up for itself.

 First of all if these characters are professional journalist they are not presented in a realistic way. These people, especially Jackson's character are allowing their personal feelings to get in the way of their reporting. I use to take journalism classes and one of the first things we were taught is never allow your feelings to get in the way of your story. Our teachers would repeatedly tell us our opinions do not matter. People do not want to read a paper where the reporter gives their opinion. They want to read about the facts.

 The second flaw in the movie is it starts to establish a romance between these two people. It too is not presented in a realistic way. We do not believe in their love affair and we do not believe they are real people. They are merely pawns used to take us from one trial hearing to the next.

 And third while I think the movie meant to present itself as neutral and merely give us a straight account of what happened it starts to become overly sentimental and seems to, at times, like a little more than a social ranting.

 But despite all of this I am recommending this movie because I can tell it was made with passion. And that passion reflects on the screen. This movie, as you may have been able to tell, is also deeply political, and because of that it may spark a debate among viewers. Any movie that can make people talk and discuss ideas can not be all bad. I'm sure there are many people who will have an opinion of these events after they watch this movie and to me that speaks to the film's strenght. The fact that it is able to communicate so deeply to us. When a movie like that comes along I feel compelled to tell others about it. And ""In My Country"" is one of those movies.

 I feel I have expressed myself quite clearly as to the film's flaws and why I like it. I have also touched upon the film's subject matter. If my reasons for recommending the movie do not seem strong enough or if you feel they do not over come the movie's flaws, stay away from this movie. But if you think the movie sounds interesting, I think you will be rewarded in the end.

 Bottom-line: ""In My Country"" falls short of greatness due to a weak script and some preachy dialogue but the movie is able to stir a passion deep inside its viewers. It touches on a subject that all who see it will have an opinion on.",1120608000,,3496,4.4021739130434785

2292120,5,B0009I8QGI,"This compelling movie about an important subject deserves more attention. The Truth and Reconciliation board helped heal the wounds and maintain the peace in post Apartheid South Africa. White South African's who committed atrocities were offered amnesty in exchange for providing full accounts of what they did and for apologizing as long as their actions were given under orders from their superiors (although I don't think they deserved it). Samuel Jackson and Juliette Binoche make a great team. Jackson plays an African American journalist who covers the hearings and Binoche plays a white South African poet and radio journalist who meets him there. They bond as they hear heart wrenching testimony. This unlikely pair have a complicated affair and learn a whole lot about themselves along the way. The visuals were spectacular too.

2292139,5,B0009I8QGI,"This movie gripes you in and doesn't let you go throughout the film, and tales the sad tale of true events while it has you in its grasp. While the characters are based on real life people, The Truth and Reconciliation Commission actually happened, and the stories told form the people reflect some of what was told during this.

The story is an emotional journey through the traumatic events that happened to the poor people in South Africa before Nelson Mandela took power. It also about how these events effect the three central characters, who are reporters taking account the reconciliation events. As clich as it is, Africa is a character on itself. From the beautiful landscapes and stars, while at the same time being horrifying since this is where all these events have taken place in.

With Samuel L. Jackson as one of the three main cast members, naturally the acting is going to be great. The emotional moments are pulled off by all these characters, and you felt what they were feeling throughout the movie, and this really adds to the picture.

Throughout the movie you hear just a small score of a piano being played, and this just adds to the helplessness the characters and the audience are feeling. You also have chants and hymens that the South Africans are singing thought the movie, and this adds to the spirit of Ubuntu and how the effected people of South Africa are feeling.

With the special features, they interview a chunk of the cast members (sorry no Samuel L. Jackson interview), and how this story effected them and what they choose to add to the story. It also has deleted scenes that were taken out for pacing reasons, but I feel like it could have easily been added to the movie, so it's worth a watch through. You also have your typical Directors commentary that talks about how the movie was made and what not.

Overall I say defiantly see this movie today, it's a gripping tale of the atrocities that happened in South Africa and how it affects everyone.

It wasn't always factual but was powerful.  The performances were Oscar winning to me, and the beauty of song Senzenina (The Power of One) moving throughout the film made me weep.  A must for anyone interested in a visceral look at those powerful days and months of the Truth and Reconciliation Committee hearings in South Africa.  As we look at the problems that South Africa now faces, we can easily see through this movie, how they came to be, and how complicated the problems are.  God help Africa, a land that many of us love.",1222992000,,677,4.56198347107438
2292144,2,B0009I8QGI,"""In My Country"" (also known as ""Country of My Skull"") stars Juliette Binoche and Samuel L. Jackson based on Antjie Krog's novel. Binoche is Anna, Afrikaner poet and radio broadcaster while Jackson is Langston, sent from a Chicago newspaper. They both report the hearings of TRC (Truth and Reconciliation Commission) in South Africa, where people gave their testimonies about the violence and abuses during Apartheid. Langston is also given a chance to interview a notorious police head De Jager (Brendan Gleeson), who knows what really happened to some of the victims.

But somehow director John Boorman thought it necessary to follow another story about Anna (who is married) and Langston who develop instant dislike to each other, then come to be romantically attracted. Except the fine acting from the two, their romantic story does not offer much partly because the film refuses to develop it, but the main reason is I think Boorman crammed too many things into the plot - most notably Anna's parents' story and Anna's brother's one, both of which should be left in cutting room. And the film tells us the story of De Jager and a little girl, which needs more time and more detailed storytelling.

[UBUNTU] As far as TRC section is concerned, the film is great. The testimonies are not only heart-rending but multi-layered because both sides must be present at the hearings. The film also has one great message based on a traditional idea called Ubuntu, humanist concept about the relations between humans.

But I still cannot see why Ubuntu should be told with the melodramatic story Anna and Langston. Philip Noyce's ""Catch a Fire"" (which is also set in South Africa) has certainly love affair in its plot, but it never occupied the central stage. ""In My Country"" is certainly made with good intention and has insightful moments about sins and forgiveness, but overall they are overshadowed by something else that should be told elsewhere.",1181865600,,1945,4.996913580246914
2292145,2,B0009I8QGI,"There are a lot of great movies about the South African struggle. I've seen ""Gandhi"" several times. I loved ""The Power of one"" and ""Cry Freedom"". But I suspect I'm not the only one who sees a video about Apartheid in the video store and thinks: Do I really feel like being preached to tonight? I mean I already get it, Apartheid is bad.

The good news about this film is that, in comparison to the other Apartheid films I've seen, it offers a fresh take. It takes during the Truth and Reconciliation commission hearings after the fall of Apartheid in 1994. During these hearings anyone who had committed atrocities during the apartheid era could make a full confession recieve amnesty provided they had only been following orders.

As such, the film offers a whole new set of issues to explore. Not simply ""Let's all agree on how awful apartheid is"", but also what is the best way for a society to move forward after the nightmare is over? What is more important for society, justice or reconciliation?

The bad news is that the film never manages to rise to the bar it has set for itself. As is often the case with these historical films, the fictional characters and story the film makers have created don't do justice to the real history. We get a glimpse of the complexity of issues under discussion at these hearings, but then the story veers away to the personal lives of white South African Anna Malan (Juliette Binoche) and cynical American journalistLangston Whitfield ( Samuel L. Jackson) and the unlikely Romance that develops between them. This would have been a much better movie if it had stayed more focused on the actual historical events, and skipped the hollywood love story.

It's not a bad movie, but it's one of those movies that flirts with genius, and then drops the ball, and you feel the disappointment bitterly. It is apparently based on a non-fiction book, ""The Country of my Skull"" which is supposed to be much better.",1179360000,,1946,4.664723032069971
2292146,3,B0009I8QGI,"OK, its a 3 star movie... but the issues raised as the reasons for a poor rating strike me as people who misunderstand the reality of South Africa. Having lived in SA both during the apartheid era, as well as during the TRC period, I have to beg to differ with some of the other reviewers.

1. the affair -- just follow the psychological distancing of Anna from her husband and her white liberal Afrikaner lifestyle, as she enters into the story of the real South Africa. The pyscho-social encounter of the real TRC hearings is beyond the capacity of a re-creation to convey. She bonded with someone who was with her in the moment, then realized it was a mistake. [besides the fact that affairs and other social aberrations were so common in the white community under the guise of the respectable Nationalist years]

2. how could Anna not really know what was going on? it's called compartmentalizing. you sense, out of the corner of your eye, but you don't want to admit that it could be true, so you repress. Especially when admitting to the truth would mean the end of life as you know it. We all do it, in various ways. Binoche's overdoing the breakdown scene in the hearing was poor, granted. But did those destabilizing occurrences happen at the TRC hearings, amongst the regular participants (journalists, commissioners, support staff)? yes...

3. how can Hollywood really portray the idea of forgiveness, amnesty, ubuntu -- its all a bit sappy, and ideological sounding, until you actually try to do it as a nation. has it all turned out to be a happy ending? no. but it had to be tried, otherwise there is no reason to hope for something better. (hence her brother's suicide)

for me the film gave a little glimpse of some human beings interacting with the notion of the TRC and the South African context. thanks John Boorman.",1164412800,,1835,4.654320987654321

2292148,4,B0009I8QGI,"In My Country helped me fully comprehend the tragic mistake of Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress in refusing to renounce terrorism.  There is little doubt but that their embrace of bloody Marxist-Leninist principles unwittingly extended the existence of the apartheid South African government for at least a few more decades.  The movie deals with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's attempt to reconcile the divisions within the white and black communities.  Both sides are guilty of horrifying atrocities.  Apartheid may no longer be the law of the land---but will love and forgiveness instead of revenge bring everybody together?  How could generally decent people do such horrible things to other human beings?Amnesty will be granted only to those willing to publicly tell the truth.  An Afro-American journalist is sent by the Washington Post to report on these hearings.  He is something of a bigot for he mostly blames whites for all the violence.  Conveniently, the murders and torturing of whites by blacks are ignored.  An illicit romantic relationship develops between himself and an Afrikaner woman who has a far more balanced perspective about the past horrors.

Brendan Gleeson is superb as the vile South African military officer who seemingly enjoyed sadistically victimizing suspected black terrorists.  However, one soon realizes that he and other whites rationalized away their behavior because of the commitment to violence by Nelson Mandela and the ANC.  They should have not been provided with this excuse.  It only worsened an already bad situation.  The nonviolent policies of Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi would have accomplished so much more.  In My Country is thought provoking.  This may not be a five star film, but it is still well worth a few hours of your time.

A married mother with three children has an affair with a journalist and yet she's the one to fight for someone rights or to be compassionate about someone. What a non-sense!

Hope the greedy amateurs who created this movie WON some money

2292160,4,B0009I8QGI,"I'm one who enjoyed this movie. I haven't always been a John Boorman fan. He's sort of hit or miss with me, and it often feels that his politics highjacks the story and pushes the characters in certain ways. I didn't feel this way about this film, though.

I did find the Truth and Reconcilation testimonies to be convincing and heartrending. They give you enough of the horrors of Apartheid without making the entire movie nothing more than a catalog of crimes.

I like the relationships between Binoche's and Jackson's characters. It felt real to me, and interesting that Boorman deals maturely with infidelity. He doesn't make an overt issue of it, but we as viewers certainly know that both these characters are married with children. Still, however, they're put together and surrounded by such emotive material that it makes sense they should be drawn together.

Don't go away from some of the earlier reviews thinking this is a feel-good movie in which whites come off looking good. They don't. Binoche's character is an activist, yes, but her father's a racist and her brother, it turns out, was involved in incredible atrocities. This movie is far from simple. Just the opposite, it does honor to a complex issue that taints all the players.",1132617600,12,1249,4.854460093896714

The movie has been panned as being to simplistic, well... some of us who didn't understand what was going on in South Africa need things simplistic.

Jackson and Binoche play very powerful roles, I just wish their roles had been written a little differently -- and I sooo don't have a problem with interracial relationships.  I just believe more could have been accomplished by portraying their relationship differently and is why I give it 4 rather than the 5 stars I so want to give it.",1128470400,8,809,4.462585034013605
2292162,2,B0009I8QGI,"""In My Country"" is undermined straight from the start by its tone deaf casting. This film - based on the narrative writings of stellar South African journalist Antjie Krog - somehow gets a starring duo of a Frenchwoman and Irishman playing Afrikaaners and an American (Samuel L. Jackson) ludicrousy grafted on top of the screenplay for the sake of starpower and a wacky, contrived melodrama that never existed in Krog's tale.  This is most unfortunate because Krog's stories - her take on South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission - is one that should be heard far and wide.  Unfortunately, the filmmakers bury that behind this odd and inexplicable need to feature a quasi-adulterous liaison between Binoche and Jackson's characters.

How did it turn out?  Take a look at the DVD extras:  Samuel L. Jackson is nowhere to be found.  This is a man who knows quality and knows junk.  He must taken a look at the final product and ran from this thing as fast as he could.

Good move. Smart guy.",1128470400,,999,4.767441860465116
2292163,5,B0009I8QGI,"This 2004 film is also called ""In The Country of My Skull"" and must have had a very short run at the box office because I never heard of it.  And yet it stars Samuel L. Jackson and Juliette Binoche, both excellent actors.  Their roles demand nuanced performances in this story set at The Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa after Apartheid ended.  In order to keep the country from upheavals and violence, these hearings allowed people to appear before a public tribunal, confess exactly what they did, convince the tribunal that they were just following orders, and then make a public apology.  These hearings were heart wrenching for all, but allowed redemption.  Most of the people were forgiven or given light jail sentences.  But then there were some whose crimes went way beyond the limits that could be pardoned.

The film, based on a memoir by a journalist, is fictionalized for greater impact.  Samuel L. Jackson is cast as a Washington Post reporter who is covering the story.  Juliette Binoche is an Afrikaner who does a local daily radio broadcast.  Both are married.  And yet a strong bond forms between these too, leading to a romance.  Their roles call for emotional complexity.  And both of them succeed magnificently, seeming to enter the very core of their characters as they meet both victims and victimizers and grasp the reality of the horror.  I applaud their performances and I applaud the screenplay.  I was totally involved and also very sad.  The film presented some upsetting truths. And, as when any truth is probed this deeply, there are no easy answers.

I didn't cry real tears.  It was not that kind of film.  Rather I felt it deep inside and now, several weeks later, I am still thinking about it.

A big bonus on the DVD was the many interviews with the director, the stars and the writer.  Each of them talked about how they had to look at themselves and their own lives and come to terms with some harsh truths about their own ethnic backgrounds.  I came away thinking of my own life in this context.

This is perhaps the most worthwhile film I've seen this year.  It's not pleasant to watch.  You won't come away with any answers and you won't be smiling.  And you won't understand any more than you do now.  But your perception will surely be broadened.  And you just might see a light brought to the dark side of human nature through the act of forgiveness.

Definitely recommended.  But not for the faint of heart.",1126828800,18,2470,4.663573085846868
2292164,3,B0009I8QGI,"The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, (TRC), was a court-like body assembled in South Africa after Apartheid ended. The mandate of the commission, established under Nelson Mandela, was ""to bear witness to, record and in some cases grant amnesty to the perpetrators of crimes relating to human rights violations, reparation and rehabilitation."" Anybody who felt they had been a victim of violence could come forward and be heard before the Commission. Perpetrators of violence could also give testimony and request Amnesty from prosecution. The hearings made headlines around the world and many sessions were televised on national TV.

John Boorman's political drama is set in South Africa in 1996, at the beginning of the TRC hearings. The film includes testimony which graphically describes the brutal atrocities perpetrated under the apartheid system and is extremely moving. The hearings were designed to bring a measure of domestic peace to South Africa following decades of violent, inhumane and repressive government. I believe that Boorman's goal here is to help westerners understand the African concept of ""ubuntu,"" or justice that involves confession, forgiveness and a restoration of amity rather than mere retribution. And he does succeed on many levels. However, the movie has some major flaws which seriously distract from the inspirational story.

Anna Malan, (Juliette Binoche), a progressive Afrikaaner journalist and poet, is assigned to cover the hearings for a local radio station in Cape Town. Her commentary will also be broadcast on National Public Radio in the United States. Anna comes from a wealthy South African family with large landholdings. They have farmed here for generations. The Malan family would prefer that Anna not become involved in any activities surrounding the TRC. However, she is extremely optimistic that a deep and abiding peace will prevail, eventually, between fellow citizens, black and white. She identifies strongly with Africa, and the principle of ""ubuntu.""

Dumi Mkhalipi (Menzi ""Ngubs"" Ngubane), plays Anna's savvy black South African assistant.

Washington Post correspondent Langston Whitfield, (Samuel L. Jackson), in Cape Town to cover the events, has a much more cynical view of the proceedings. He believes the hearings represent a giant smokescreen designed to protect the whites from the consequences of their crimes. He would much rather a harsher punishment be imposed, one reflecting vengeance. After his initial, contentious discussion with Anna he begins to mellow, interpersonally anyway, and to hang out with her and Dumi. She finally makes her point that she is as African as he is, and in many ways, more so.

There is a subplot involving Whitfield's series of interviews with Colonel De Jager, (Brendan Gleeson), a member of the military in the former apartheid regime, responsible for numerous atrocities and notorious for innovative torture techniques.

The testimonies are  extremely well depicted, and as I mentioned above, quite emotional. Seamus Deasy, director of photography, beautifully captures the majesty of the South African countryside. And the historical theme is perfect for adaptation into a first-class drama. So what happens? Where do things go wrong? (And they do).

Well, I'd like to know why a contrived, awkward romance was stuck right in the middle of the main storyline? Is not the drama of apartheid, plus the concept of ""ubuntu,"" as well as actual historic testimony, great actors, unbelievable cinematography, etc., enough to create significant cinema? Did ""In My Country"" need the embellishment of an adulterous romance? There's not a scintilla of chemistry between Anna and Langston. Totally unnecessary and distracting filler!

And why the melodrama? There is more than enough serious, true life material to have to resort to extravagant portrayals. This kind of writing/directing trivializes rather than accentuates and dramatizes. There is one courtroom scene where Juliette Binoche, (one of my favorite actresses), goes right over the top. I felt embarrassed for her and for the lack of subtlety with which she was asked to perform. Also, I do find it difficult to believe that Anna is so shocked by the testimonies. After all, she has lived in South Africa all of her life. As an American, I knew about many of the atrocities committed during apartheid - in the 1980's. Fewer than four million Afrikkaners stood by while more than 30 million of their countrymen and women were oppressed and brutalized, simply because of the color of their skin. And Anna is shocked? She is a journalist. She must have traveled outside Africa. I am sure she read articles and books from other countries? Was there no progressive/liberal underground? Simply not credible. Anna was also, always, the only person to react with such surprise. Has she been on Mars?

I believe that most of the movie's problems lie in screenwriter Ann Peacock's adaptation of South African Antjie Krog's semi-autobiographical book, ""Country of My Skull,"" and in John Boorman's clumsy, often heavy-handed direction.

Remember, there is an upside to my review, and it is for the movie's ""plusses"" that I give it 3 stars. Everyone should see it, for the history and for the knowledge it imparts. I am just reminded what a brilliant film ""Hotel Rwanda"" is and know that ""In My Country"" could have been turned into a 5 Star work of art also. The subject matter warrants it.

2292168,4,B0009I8QGI,"This film is very well portrayed.  I haven't read ""Country of My Skull"" to compare how truthful the movie is to Antjie Krog's depiction, but both Jackson and Binoche have done a superb job representing their characters.  Director John Boorman stated that Samuel Jackson had to play a much more emotional role in this film than what he was used to. This becomes evident in his character.  We're used to Samuel Jackson playing the cool walking, sharp-talking bad-ass.  In this role, a vulnerable more complex side comes out.  Binoche was on target, as usual, and seemless with her South African accent. I thought this film was beautifully done with the right emotional balance of forgiveness, anger, shame and happiness.  Too much melodrama and graphic imagery would have pushed the film over the edge and become cliche.  It's good for American audiences to break away from the usual Hollywood formula and see other angles of cinema.

The South African actors depicted in the movie are just as lively as the South Africans I met a couple years ago in Johannesburg and Cape Town. Boorman has done a fabulous job of capturing the South African spirit of both whites and blacks.  Both have a strong love of their country despite their strained past.  The true spirit of Unbutu (forgiveness) is ever present.

I, too, wondered why the part of Anna was not given to native South African actress Charlize Theron, but it's director's preogrative.  Perhaps her experiences of growing up in an Apartheid society would have inadvertently biased the film from the tone of the movie the director intended to portray or maybe it was because Juliette Binoche was similar in appearance to Antjie Krog.  Boorman did state it was Binoche's right emotional range in her acting that was suited for the role.

The cinematography of the film was fantastic, bringing out the gorgeous sweeping South African landscape.  I'm hoping future movies about South Africa are not just about Apartheid or AIDS.  It is a truly beautiful country with many enjoyable facets and beautiful people.  This is the chance for young fresh directors of South Africa to bring their country out onto the global stage.",1122681600,5,2170,4.933884297520661

The 4 principal actors (Binache, Gleason, Jackson, and Ngubane) of course were excellent, but even those who did the minor parts were fine.  The actor portraying Archbishop Tutu doesn't look a bit like him, and I don't really know why they didn't ask the Archbishop to play himself -- it wasn't a big or exhausting part, and he'd have been perfect!

If you want to get a hint of the ugly tragedy of Apartheid as parts of it came out during the Truth And Reconciliation hearings, this film is a good choice.  The sadness, viciousness, and unfairness will stick with you.",1467072000,,674,4.545454545454546
