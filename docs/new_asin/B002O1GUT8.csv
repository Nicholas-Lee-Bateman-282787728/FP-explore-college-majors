8375823,5,B002O1GUT8,"Even intense students of World War II need to add this to their collection, because it reveals in detail the facts about the defense and fall of Wake Island.  It blends narratives about the island's fate with eyewitness testimony from some of the survivors, and some film.  This is NOT a WWII propaganda film, but a true, revealing account of what happened there.  Much of this story is heartrending, especially concerning the fate of the civilian contractors who were murdered en mass by their Japanese captors, and what happened to those military personnel who were enslaved yet found ways to survive.",1441756800,,603,4.9504950495049505

8375825,5,B002O1GUT8,I saw this program on the History Channel probably five or so years ago. Very much impressed with it and I have always wanted a copy and I have it now and it is hit.  Being a retired Navy man this of this nature really mean a lot more to me.  Granted Wake Island was part of WWII but I did three tours in Nam and it has great personal meaning.  Thank you for having this available.,1419292800,,381,3.9220779220779223
