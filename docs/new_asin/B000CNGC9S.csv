8099690,5,B000CNGC9S,"I really agree with Jared.  Not being Latin I had no Latin music and no dance experience.  We started classes and bought this, as well as other music, to help speed up our learning process.  Yes, it is a bit ""boxey"" in the way it is portrayed but, as a beginner...that is the level this device says it is and that is correct.
Once we got most of the information we just used the music to practice with and forgot about the video part.  For the price, don't regret the purchase and would recommend to beginners. Using a beginners scale I would give a 9 out of 10. It could be updated a little.",1401753600,2,592,4.166666666666667
8099691,5,B000CNGC9S,I started dancing just a couple years ago because I was tired sitting on the chair whenever we go to party and like to dance but doesn't know how to dance but after watching and learning Kasia Kosiak vidoeo I was able to enjoy more all the party we attend.,1365033600,,256,4.14
8099692,3,B000CNGC9S,"If you are looking for a primer in Salsa that is cheap, go for it.  However, you'd probably receive more interesting instruction elsewhere.  This DVD struck me as flat, unemotive, and sterile.

The instruction is indeed precise, but salsa is a very emotional and seductive dance.  This DVD presents it as more of a surgical procedure :D",1293321600,,336,4.842105263157895
8099693,4,B000CNGC9S,"My wife and I started taking salsa lessons, and we used this video to supplement our lessons with different moves that our instructor did not know/had not taught us. We thought this video was very useful, but I would suggest first taking a few lessons to get confortable with the foot-work before jumping into this video. Overall good.",1192320000,2,335,4.793103448275862
8099694,1,B000CNGC9S,After starting salsa classes I thought I would get a video to use at home to supplement my classes but this video is awful!  There is a couple who are dancing together and they show you each person's steps while they are dancing.  It's very boring and their voices just drone.  I am a beginner so this video is not too slow but after one run through I will never use it again.  I'll probably just give it to the goodwill.  I would not recommend this video to anyone.,1188259200,3,466,4.191011235955056
