8202977,3,B000RXZL0Y,"Low budget 2007 made for TV looking tale of a woman who returns to the small town she grew up in and insists she isn't leaving until those who wronged her by leaving her in the lurch, admit their role in the death of a kid who ran a stop sign on a bike and paid the ultimate price when they drunkenly took the wheel and pedals of her car while she was driving.  Of course these guys and those that helped them discredit her version aren't prepared to do that but are prepared to do whatever to get her to drop the matter, one way or the other.

That's what really makes no sense in this film.  They want her to let it go, they are quite wealthy, why not just sit down with her give her some cash, give her some more cash to give to the family of the kid or some charity on his behalf.  Or at least try that method, how does killing an animal and putting it on her doorstop persuade someone to let something go.  How does pulling her over and intimidating her achieve that? Yet these are these complete moron guys initial moves. Not to mention she told this story when the kid died, no one believed her then and everyone would expect her to tell it again. Also why wait 25 years? She was out of prison in three, some line about waiting for Grandma to die at the start made no sense, surely Grandma wants her granddaughter's name cleared too so she could walk around town proud instead of ashamed.

There's plenty of weak writing in this one, and a few faces that perhaps had a bit too much plastic surgery before filming commenced.  Not to mention the story is pretty predictable.  Demons From Her Past is a title you'd think would imply the woman got away with something and her past is coming back to haunt her rather than her being that demon who is coming back to derail those lives who have a past to hide.",1446422400,,1810,4.181034482758621

8202981,4,B000RXZL0Y,"This movie is very Informitive and educational,It shows the realitys of wild driving. Not that she was driving wild,Someone else had the wheel when she hit the kid on a bike,Not to bad of a movie,A Good movie to buy.",1239062400,3,216,4.425
8202982,2,B000RXZL0Y,"The premise was good but the flaws really shined.  First, why do scenes of hospital beds always show the patient in a dark room with siderails down and door closed?  This patient was in ICU without a nurse right there watching him.  What's with the medical advice on this show.  Also...info about the patient would NEVER be discussed with a stranger.  This violates HIPPA laws.  The scene of the ICU nurse talking to the gal probing the death would never happen.  Also....the doctor would not be sneaking in to give a drug without the nurse seeing it.  ICU nurses keep patients in full view at all times.  Otherwise not a bad show.",1238198400,2,631,4.5625
8202983,5,B000RXZL0Y,"This movie is very good!!!
