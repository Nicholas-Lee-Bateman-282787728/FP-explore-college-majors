7856785,4,6303909272,"What is this video? It is part first-person documentary, and part appreciation, made in the mid-90s when Wilson finally seemed to be finding the peace of mind that stays with him today. (His obviously devoted new wife stays beside him for much of the footage. Dr. Landy, who basically saved Brian's life according to Brian's 1991 autobiography, is now out of the picture and is never mentioned by name.) The entire thing is filmed in very arty, hard-lit black-and-white. There is no narration except for that of the inteviewees, and not much archival footage of the Beach Boys. What we get instead is Brian himself giving us brief, converstional summaries of periods of his life and songwriting inspiration, supplemented by comments from his mother, his ex-wife Marilyn, and his brother Carl (who died a few years after this film was made in the mid-nineties.) There are also some enlightening musical analysis from someone (I'm not sure who he is), and appreciative comments from fellow musicians ranging from Wilson collaborators Tony Asher and Van Dyke Parks, to David Crosby, John Cale, Tom Petty, and Linda Ronstadt. Wilson's daughters also comment briefly on their relationship with their Dad, and sing with him at the end. Throughout the film, certain excellent old songs of Brian are briefly discussed and then we get good footage of Brian performing the songs with a new studio band in Hollywood. (The performances, produced by Don Was, are very good, and fans might want to consider buying the soundtrack CD of this film. Fans expecting to hear the original Beach Boy recordings will not find them here.) Parts of the film feel like surreal arthouse filmmaking - silent closeups of Audree Wilson's face behind sunglasses as she gropes for words, odd footage of Brian and his mother and brother singing ""In my Room"" at the piano, Linda Ronstadt in a spotlight dressed in a puffy costume for some unknown theatrical show... Overall this is not a definitive documentary of Wilson's life or work by any means, but it does give you a good idea of why this odd man is so beloved and why his work is so important.",1032998400,16,2116,4.864265927977839

7856787,4,6303909272,"Brian Wilson-The Heart and Soul of one of the greatest american rock bands of all time, the Beach Boys. Though the Beach Boys stand among rock's elite enshrined forever within the Rock N' Roll of Fame, It was Brian WIlson's  genius, his vision and his dictatorial quest of perfection thats what  gotten them there.
Brain Wilson, an ubused child, grew up in the  hedonistic environment of sunny California, were the 50's and early sixties  placed california not only as a state-but as a state of mind. In time,  Brian Wilson obtained the knack of songwriting and in return gave us  timeless music; ""surfer Girl"", ""I Get around"",  ""California Girls"", ""Good Vibrations"" and the  monumental songcycle Pet Sounds-just to name a few. What he got in return  was dissension, pain and mental illness. Though he has made a somewhat  recovery from his illness, he still suffers today. Though still spirited  and active, it is painfully obvious that his best days and work are clearly  behind him. He has made brief well-produced efforts: his first self titled  solo album (1989) and the recent Imagination (1998). This Video also has an  improptu performance of wilson and Van Dyke Parks  with ""Orange Crate  Art"" from the 1995 album of the same name. Don Was captured wilson as  a tired, but enlightened old warhorse, his looks and voice now more mellow,  more tattered than the adrenilene-drenched 21 year old whose pristine  voice, four-part harmony, and inventive bass patterns propelled him and his  band to legendary status.
The video recounts the Beach Boys heyday,  culminating with the 1966 Melody Maker poll of the band being the  ""number one world's best band"" over the Beatles.  Equally  touching is the participation of his daughters Carnie and Wendy (of  Wilson-Phillips) on the 1968 hit ""Do it Again"", were Wilson still  has the chops and has fun showing them off. Other performances-such as  ""Caroline No"" and ""Til I Die"" recount Wilsons Highs and  lows without any nuance of nostalgia.
The video was primarily intended to  educate fans and inquirers of who Brian Wilson was and what contributions  he's made to rock and pop. Often written-off as a burnt-out, crazy sixties  drug addict, the film gives a new dimension (one without Beach Boy  limitations)to the man and the artist. This film, originally presented on  cable's Disney Channel, serves as a document-a sort of snapshot-to how  Brian Wilson emerged from mental illness and craziness to a model of  self-respect and self-dignity that everyone can appreciate.",923702400,13,2524,5.0290556900726395
