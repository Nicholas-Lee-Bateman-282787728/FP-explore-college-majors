8251399,5,B0013JYUKI,one  of the better coaching disks available  I threw the discus my senior year in high school-- in 1964. I returned to the sport as a senior olympian and also as a senior track & field competitor and needed a refresher coaching program. This DVD is the best of the 3 disks on technique that I have purchased.,1425513600,,308,4.293103448275862
8251400,5,B0013JYUKI,Excellent you get your money's worth with the technique this DVD displays and I would recommend to every coach and thrower,1395878400,,122,4.857142857142857
8251401,5,B0013JYUKI,If you study this dvd you will see the correct throwing positions at any point in the throw and he suggests drills to correct errors. I was impressed with his in- depth knowledge of the body positions and balance through-out the throw. This isn't a generalized or basic-rules view he really see's the throw all the way thru and can stop at any point and suggest guidelines for your position and balance. Even if you have excellent coaching this is a great study.,1330732800,,462,4.578313253012048
