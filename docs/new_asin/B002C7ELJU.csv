3904756,5,B002C7ELJU,"...My kids cannot get enough of this adorable video!  My daughter got it for her birthday, and she's a Wubbzy fanatic.  She has all the DVDs and this one is officially her favorite (at least until&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wubb-Idol/dp/B0028AD73W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wubb Idol</a>&nbsp;comes out).  This is a really cute compilation of seasonal Wubbzy episodes, many of which are not on TV until late October and then at no other time.  So you probably won't get too tired of seeing it.  Unless your kids want to watch it every day like mine do... but I can think of many much worse things!",1255219200,,646,5.551020408163265

3904760,5,B002C7ELJU,"My 4 1/2-year-old loves this DVD.  She doesn't usually like the Halloween DVDs because they give her bad dreams, but this one is so mild...and it teaches lessons as well!",1280275200,,170,4.666666666666667

3904764,5,B002C7ELJU,"Wubbzy really can't ever disappoint my child.  And it is one of very few kid shows that I find cute to watch.  The fall season episodes are especially cute and funny.  There are a few episodes that aren't on tv (at least I have never seen them), so that in and of itself made the purchase worthwhile.",1256083200,2,300,4.228070175438597
3904765,5,B002C7ELJU,"As an adult, I was a little disappointed that there weren't any new episodes on this particular DVD, but it's not for me so I guess that is a moot point. My 2-year-old is obsessed with Wubbzy and absolutely adores this collection. It's bright, fun and just all-around cute. It's one of the few shows that doesn't absolutely irk me to have on in the background (Honestly, I can't handle Backyardigans or Dora; the music and voices drive me nuts!), and I approve of her watching it. Wow, wow, everyone! :)",1255910400,,503,4.538461538461538

8363477,3,B002C7ELJU,"Disclaimer: I find Wubbzy to be terribly annoying. But, I'm an adult. My kids love this DVD and watch it over and over again each Halloween.

It consists of 6 episodes of ""Wow Wow Wobbzy."" Three are Halloween themed, one is fall themed, and two are kind of a stretch to connect to the season. My kids don't care, though. The content is certainly appropriate for preschoolers, the parents just might not find it as entertaining as some other videos.",1325203200,,448,4.6
