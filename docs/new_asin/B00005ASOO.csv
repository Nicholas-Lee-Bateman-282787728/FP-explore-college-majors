1418233,2,B00005ASOO,"""Disappearing Acts"" is Terry McMillan's best novel--even better than ""Waiting to Exhale,"" so it's surprising that nobody bothered to give it a film adaptation until now.  Nevertheless, this HBO-only special is a huge disappointment to those who have already read the book, and those who haven't read it will wonder what the big fuss was about in the first place.  Sanaa Lathan gives a reasonably solid performance as a school teacher struggling with a recording career in New York City.  She crosses paths with ruffneck Franklin Swift, who's still married to his estranged wife and is the father of two kids; this dude has more baggage than LAX airport.  Their relationship blossoms and faces its share of many hurdles, but the movie never lives up to the promise of the book.  For one, Wesley Snipes, though a very good actor in his own right, is miscast as Franklin Swift.  His performance lacks the ruggedness and street-sensibility that his role requires.  Treach or even Malik Yoba would make a better Franklin.  Plus, the movie dodges many issues that Terry McMillan's book addresses such as domestic violence and homophobia.  In the book, Franklin Swift was a vicious homophobe, who never ran out of nasty things to say about gays.  The movie had every opportunity to explore Franklin's sexual insecurities, but it ultimately cops out. At this point, it takes no psychic to figure out where this review is leading: ""Disappearing Acts"" isn't a total disaster, but it's a very bland, safe picture that does the book no justice.",1008892800,25,1532,4.94921875
1418234,5,B00005ASOO,"Hot, Hot, Hot. Wesley Snipes and Sanaa Lathan were fantastic. They have excellent chemistry. This is the first time I paid attention to Wesley Snipes work ( I'm not a fan of Action/Adventure films) and was blown away by Sanaa's performance.
I was glad to see African American Blue Collar Workers deplicted in a roll where they weren't stereotyped as always having to struggle in life and usually having a hard time succeeding or reaching their goals.
Very realistic story with an Excellent ending!!",1008806400,4,498,4.940476190476191
1418235,5,B00005ASOO,"I was really pleased to see this movie on HBO. Wesley Snipes and Sanaa Latham are great together.  They give off just the right energy to portray the tedious edgy love affair they have in the movie.  Franklin (Wesley) is great as a hard working blue collar worker who falls in love with a beautiful mocha brown uptown girl, Zora (Sanaa).  Franklin's character has just the right amount of anger as not to make him seem abusive and overwhelming.  He comes across more misunderstood.  Zora comes across well as a woman who loves her man deeply but may not always understand the sensitivities that make him who is.
An XLNT movie to watch.  It is good a second time.",1007510400,3,662,4.5210084033613445
1418236,5,B00005ASOO,"Coming from England, I didn't even know that this film was made. I completely stumbled upon the DVD whilst shopping online. Yes, I have read the book and I was concerned that the film would not do it justice. How wrong I was. The film was KICKING !! It has to be said that I don't rate Wesley personally or professionally but working alongside Sanaa, the two of them just set the film on fire. The acting cannot be faulted. They seemed to make the ideal couple and some scenes are dangerously erotic, particularly the part where Zora goes to the refrigerator to get Franklin a drink...........................
I'm just wondering why it did not come out in the cinema. Is there a soundtrack available? The tunes were wicked",999907200,7,722,4.6484375
1418237,4,B00005ASOO,"Disappearing Acts is a black love story about a woman pursuing her singing career (Sanaa Lathan) who gets involved in a relationship with an unstable man, ie...doesn't have a stable job, doesn't have an education, is still married, and can't take care of his children (Wesley Snipes). This movie depicts the ups and downs of what some blacks go through concerning relationships. Things get pretty heated up in the movie but in the end the relationship fails. But it is a coincidence that when they split up they do better for themselves and they are doing the things they should of done while they were together. It goes to show sometimes you need to get out of a bad relationship to make things right and to better yourself.",997401600,7,725,4.671875
1418238,5,B00005ASOO,"I found this to be one of HBO's finest.  The title alone captures the intimacy of this movie.  Sanaa blew me away first of all with her singing voice, it was her wasn't it?  Wesley played a good role as always.  Both of their attitudes seemed so real, like I was watching two people live their completely opposite lives, right next door to me.  I never would have thought this movie would be this good.  I applaud the movie producers, actors and HBO for promoting this.  It is well worth the money and time.  It is something every couple, whether your Afican American or not, should take the opportunity to watch.  You can learn a lot from watching positive movies like this.",996624000,22,675,4.467213114754099
1418239,4,B00005ASOO,It is happening that when African Americans make films depicting themselves you get outstanding performances! Gone are the days of jive blackened white movies. Kudos to Wesley Snipes for a job well done.,996192000,4,203,5.181818181818182
1418240,4,B00005ASOO,"I read the book to this and it was much better (Of course), but it's about time I see Wesley Snipes play in a movie that's actually descent, and not some super hero (blade). He needs more good roles like he had in ""New Jack City"", and even ""Jungle Fever"".  But this movie was really good.  He did an excellent job in this one. Saana Lathan did a wonderful job too.  I like her.  I hope she does more movies in the future.",996019200,,421,4.036144578313253
1418241,5,B00005ASOO,"sanna lathon does it again. she has a nack for picking the best roles and i guess going with the director from love and basketball and the writer of waiting to exhale wasn't such a bad choice. how stella got her groove back was  a major flop so they went by way of hbo to bring out the love story of disappearing acts THIS MOVIE SHOULD HAVE GONE TO THE MOVIES AND WOULD HAVE BEEN NUMBER ONE ..FOR THE TIME IT WAS OUT.. this is a love story of two people who fall in and out of love, for the whole movie you want them to be together so bad but wesley messes up so bad she has to move on..until the end when he comes to see his child and they play scabble because she could never beat him HMMM CANT TELL YOU ALL THE STORY DUH..GO GET THIS DVD ITS HOT ..",994982400,2,751,3.8766233766233764
1418242,4,B00005ASOO,"If you've ever been in love with someone who was perhaps a bit out of your league and you foundd yourself constantly trying to compensate for that, then you know the rest.  Wesley Snipes gives a powerful performance as a man who is a bit over his head and in love with Zora (Sanaa Lathan).  Things heat up when the stakes get higher.  Zora is pregnant, Franklin's out of work and their class differences become even more apparent when Zora just wants a night out on the town and Franklin just can't seem to get his act together.  When the going gets tough, Franklin does a disappearing act of his own and Zora's on her own....this sounds like a familiar scenerio.  The story is familiar but the ending is better.  It looks like the family will make it after all.  That's one for single mothers.
If you're looking for a good black lover story, then ""Disappearing Acts"" is one that will leave you with a warm feeling inside and a positive feeling about love relationships.",994032000,21,970,4.508571428571429

1418263,5,B00005ASOO,"This happens to be my favorite book by Ms. McMillan ***I've read every book by her*** I still remember reading it like it was yesterday the movie was good too. Zora seemed like the perfect ambitious woman who met the wrong man (kind of sorta) don't get me wrong Franklin was a good guy too I just believe he could have done better by Zora and his baby. I fell in love with Zora from the movie & the book I did not find out about the movie until I was done with the book and I believe the casting was done perfectly. Zora was a classy, talented, good woman who just fell in love with the wrong man believing she could change him. I think Dissapearing Acts is the story of many single women I liked reading it and I would not have a problem going back to re-read it. I just wish Zora could have gotten the perfect fairytale & daughter that she deserved . . . I give Franklin a C for effort I do believe he loved Zora but he gave up to quick on changing and grew comfortable in his current situation. He did not know how good he had it until it was gone he was getting on my nerves !!!! I think this was a realistic story about everyday relationships I do believe Zora wanted things to work out and was trying her best but every woman has their breaking point and I am glad she realized that !!! . . .",1445644800,,1298,4.015444015444015

1418318,4,B00005ASOO,"Disappearing Acts is a 2000 romantic drama, directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood, and stars Sanaa Lathan, Wesley Snipes, and Regina Hall. The film is an adaptation of the New York Times best-selling novel Disappearing Acts, by Terry McMillan.

This was a well-written novel about self-discovery and the different observations of a relationship from a female perspective versus a male perspective.

Zora Banks (Sanaa Lathan) is a musicl teacher who is an aspiring singer. Franklin Swift (Wesley Snipes) is a troubled construction worker hoping to start his own business. The two quickly fall for each other. During the course of the stormy relationship, they both struggle to maintain their personal goals.

Mr. Snipes is not exactly the embodiement of the character as written in Ms. McMillian's novel. He appears too mature in age to be as naive as Franklin is written. Ms. Lathan is wonderful as Zora and this role allows her to fully utilize her acting ability.

The music of Disappearing Acts marks the appearance of Melky Sedeck (the  sister and brother of Wyclef Jean). Zora's singing voice is provided by Melky Jean. Ms. Lathan does a Academy Award-worthy lip synch. The vocals smolder with a sensuality that befits the sexually charged film Disappearing Acts.

Disappearing Acts is a must see movie.",1385942400,,1304,5.156398104265403
1418319,4,B00005ASOO,This movie is good.  Usually the books that are made into movies are pretty sucky.  But this one is a good one.  I love the strength of Sanaa's character.,1379980800,,154,4.241379310344827

1418325,4,B00005ASOO,One of Snipes better performances.  The story line was realistic to what two individuals with different backgrounds can come together and find love but not willing to let go of past demons can cause separation in the end.,1360454400,,221,4.815789473684211

1418356,1,B00005ASOO,"I was highly upset after watching this film. I find it incredibly difficult to believe that Sanaa Lathan, a college grad who is presented as a woman with some sense, decides to enter into a relationship with a married man who has two kids, no GED, and no steady job. In the next breath she moves him in her apartment and volunteers to pay ALL the rent! WTF. Seriously, I was lost, could not understand, not even fathom someone in their right mind, presumably from a good home and til that point, a good life, to be so damn desperate. At least the film could have shown me some kind of traumatic event or hints of abusive, past relationships that happened to Sanaa's character to make me slightly believe she would be capable of making such an awful, life-altering decision.

I read some of the reviews here and I am in denial that this character may actually exist in real life. Really? People, don't waste your time on this film unless you are okay with African-American women being portrayed as weak-minded and desperate with low self-esteem.  This seems to be a recurring theme with films that have a majority African-American cast and geared towards women. I am truly disgusted.

And to 'Cammie' NO I especially do not recommend this films to people of African-American descent. We've got enough problems as it is. No need to 'okay' the destructive relationship that is portrayed onscreen. People with common sense know there could be no happy ending to that.",1290816000,2,1463,4.70703125

1418379,1,B00005ASOO,"WARNING: SPOILERS

Zora (Sanaa Lathan) is an aspiring singer and song-writer recently moved to Brooklyn.  She meets Franklin (Wesley Snipes) a  carpenter as she is moving in to her newly renovated brownstone. Sparks fly between the two and they quickly wind up in bed.  This movie is pretty standard up to this point and then we learn more about the characters.  We find out Franklin is married (though separated), has two children (but rarely pays child support) and has not managed to finish high school (though he is well-spoken and can play a mean game of Scrabble).

Now for some women the breaking point to a relationship  with a guy would be finding out he is married with two kids.  In this movie?  No way.  Instead when Zora, a woman we think is intelligent, finds out these things about Franklin she is initially upset but quickly ""gets over it"" and even invites ""Fast Frankie"" to live with her.  When he lets her know that he can't even afford to split the rent with her she doesn't mind!  Instead she gives him the keys to her home and tells him not to worry about. This is first of the many improbable events that occur in this film.

Once Zora stupidly allows Fast Frankie into her home and life she gets pregnant and seriously contemplates abortion.  She makes the decision to go ahead with it and in a distasteful scene argues with  Fast Frankie as he begs her not to ""kill his baby"".  Of course Zora being Zora she decides to go ahead with having a baby with Franklin (who barely takes care of the kids he already has).  Franklin resolutely promises that he will take care of Zora and the baby and will work THREE JOBS if he has too.  The story progresses and Zora is heavily pregnant and it appears Franklin keeps his word as he finds a steady gig at a unionized construction site.

Things go well until Franklin drinks on the job, falls down injuring himself and is ultimately fired. Zora has the baby and since Franklin is too proud to accept work from his father or former boss, Zora carries the entire family financially. Keep in mind she works full-time as a music teacher, is pursuing a music career and, oh yeah, has recently had a son she has to care for.  Although Franklin doesn't have a job and won't go look for work because, as he explains it, ""it's too cold"" he doesn't try to cook, clean or change wet baby diapers.  That, of course, is women's work.

It is at this stage that we finally see some hope for this hopeless story of strange love.  Zora finally gets fed up and asks Franklin to leave.  Even in this though she makes a mistake.  After telling Franklin to pack his things and go, she leaves the house with their child.  When she returns she finds that Franklin, in a drunken self-pitying stupor, has completely trashed her home.  We see scenes where Franklin takes his hammer and rips everything he has built.  He breaks  down a coat rack, a mantle, a book case, etc.  Now, as the viewer, you can only believe that Fast Frankie, a selfish waste of space, is a truly terrible person. He trashes the home where his own child lives!  Honestly, who is this person!? Thankfully this is near the end of the film.  We see Zora getting on with life alone with her son.  She appears lonely in scenes, although after her ordeal with  Fast Frankie you would think she would be shouting with glee.  But not in this movie, no she is lonely without her shiftless man.  When Franklin knocks on Zora's door out of the blue one day, she is surprised (as are we). We hear that Franklin has been sending money to her for their son (I guess $20 can go toward diapars).  It's been over a year (!) and Franklin wants to see his son.  Later Zora and Franklin talk about things and we find out Franklin is taking an exam to become a licensed contractor.  Zora is suitably impressed because this means Franklin now has his GED (and boy is he proud of himself).  Zora can't believe the changes in Franklin (hmmm...he received his diploma for high school equivalency and he isn't drunk, what accomplishments) and looks at him with new eyes.  Their visit over, Franklin walks down the stairs leaving Zora to further contemplate the new Franklin.  A few seconds later she rushes to the stairs and calls him back up to the apartment.  The final scene of the film finds Zora and Franklin sitting happily with their son playing their favorite game, Scrabble.

Once you see this final scene, you can't help but be confused and disgusted.  Although I think the acting and directing in this film are outstanding, the characters and story line are deeply disturbing.  This film is based on a book written by Terry McMillan, an author that has made a career of writing about the desperate and curiously crazy behavior of middle-class black women in relationships.  I am not a fan of  Ms. McMillan, but I am a fan of Gina Prince-Bythewood who I can only assume took on this project as a challenge but could not quite pull off overseeing a film that makes black women appear incredibly self-deluding and obsessed with being in a relationship (any kind of relationship) even to their detriment.  If you want to see a well acted and directed feature, this is for you.  However, the movie itself is incredibly infuriating and disturbing in its portrayal of an adult woman being so completely blinded by the insecurity and fear of being alone.  I would not recommend the film for content, except as a cautionary tale.",1151798400,9,5417,4.532989690721649
1418380,4,B00005ASOO,"I was getting tired of watching this movie probably because I didn't really like the charactor Franklin he was just getting on my nerves he just felt like bagage to the girl friend (I forget the charactors name)  I got mad when Franklin wasn't doing his part in the relationship, even if he couldn't get a job, he could have at least helped out with the baby more so the mother of the child didn't have to lose out on her dream of becoming a singer.  Perhaps if she didn't meet him she might have made it.  In all fairness to Franklin there were times when the girlfriend  provoked Franklin insecurities.  For example when he had brought tickets for a concert for them for her birthday and she traded them in for better seats.  Thats a no no you don't take a gift back in front of the person who brought you the gift, that would hurt anybody and make them feel unappreciated.

All in all I thought it was a somewhat realistic story about a relationship between a man and a woman and trying to keep it togetherarguments and breakup an all.  The ending kind of leaves you hanging but you can assume they try to get back together.",1151625600,5,1127,4.333333333333333
1418381,4,B00005ASOO,"I saw ""Disappearing Acts"" a couple of times on HBO, and bought the DVD several months ago. I must admit that I was a tiny bit skeptical about whether I'd like a made-for-HBO movie. But I should have known that the ""Dream Team"" of Gina Prince-Bythewood directing and Sanaa Lathan acting, would deliver the goods. From the beginning, this movie just felt real - no glossy sets, clothes, etc. Just the genuine simplicity that you would find in the homes/lives of everywoman or everyman. This lack of unnecessary trappings allowed the characters to take the spotlight.  As usual, Sanaa Lathan lit up the screen with a natural talent and presence rarely seen in film nowadays. She demonstrated incredible acting range in this movie, conveying Zora's initial infatuation, lust, and ecstasy, which gave way to pain, frustration, hurt and, ultimately, forgiveness and self-realization. Wesley Snipes gave a surprisingly good performance as Franklin, showing why typecasting him as only an action hero would be a sheer waste of talent. While a more conventionally- handsome actor could probably have been cast as Franklin, I don't know whether he could have done the job here. Wesley has always done a superior job playing characters that are more significant by what they don't say rather than what they do. That was a good fit for the role of Franklin, with his multiple demons and insecurities. Plus, Sanaa and Wesley had a strong on-screen chemistry that made you understand why Zora and Franklin found it so difficult to let each other go. (That refrigerator love scene practically melted my TV screen!)

I thought that the movie was pretty true to the book, although, naturally, there was some cinematographic license taken here and there. The movie did a fine job of getting across the book's message that although lust/passion are easy, forging a real relationship takes work and sacrifice, even if it means letting the person you love go so that they can deal with their own issues. I think that many women (and men) can relate to what it's like to get into a co-dependent relationship where both parties lose themselves to some extent (hence the title of the movie/book).

The only reason ""Disappearing Acts"" is getting a 4.5 rather than a 5 is because deep down, I always wished that they could have cast an absolutely stunning black actor to play Franklin, who would have had the chemistry that Wesley had with Sanaa. That would have been a bit truer to Franklin's character as he was portrayed in the book.  But like I said, there's no guarantee that a beautiful male lead would have generated the same sort of sensuality that made this movie so riveting. Overall, this was a very good, well-acted movie, which made me want to re-read the book. Not to mention the soundtrack is on point. (Definitely get it if you are an R&B/soul fan).",1150934400,5,2839,4.859504132231405
1418382,5,B00005ASOO,I think anyone that has or has had a relationship can sympathize with this film. The scenes and the plot was so realistic and wonderfully played by these 2 actors. Sanna Lathan is becoming one of my favorite actresses. She's talented and beautiful. Only a movie this good can make a girl stay up until 3 in the morning crying and laughing alone. I loved it and i would watch it 100x,1149984000,2,382,4.319444444444445
1418383,4,B00005ASOO,"Sanaa Lathan is always a stunning and wonderfully charismatic actress brings Zora to life. I have seen this film multiple times and am so happy I have finally found a place to purchase it. In my opinion, I think a lot of women and men for that matter will be able to relate to this film one way or another. Women can understand what Zora goes thru via dealing with a man in time that you really wanted to love but just couldn't get there due to the man being a strain on them financially, physically, emotionally or however it suited them. At one point in time a woman experiences meeting a man that has great qualities but is not at the same station in life as they are whether it be money, education, values and so forth. Men, however, can relate in Wesley Snipes because they know what its like to work your butt off to try to get your child support payments on time or working on and off again trying to find something steady to support the one they love and prove to them it wouldn't always be like that way forever.

All in all this movie is powerful and heartfelt and very endearing.",1124064000,4,1090,4.265700483091788
1418384,4,B00005ASOO,"With the exception of the strong language at times in the film, I thought this movie was very well written and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood. For example, notice the romantic scenes that are dimly lit, and just like 'Love & Basketball' Gina makes sure you feel the characters one-on-one.

I almost didn't get Wesley Snipes character until the very end of the film. I think women will have a hard time trying to relate to his role in the film. Sanaa's character is very easy to understand and relate to of a single woman with ambitions, dreams, and going through regular life financial struggles.

Basically, the film introduces you to Zora & Franklin who fall head-over-heels for each other in a sultry, passionate love affair in the beginning. Their love builds and Franklin's B-side comes crashing in. Then he sees her B-side as well.

They both have their issues. Franklin seems defeated by the time you get to the end of the movie with all of his issues, and her issues, and so forth. And they finally decide to part ways only to.......

By the way, they had a baby together in the movie. The problem with their relationship is that it was one with all the bad timing but in the end...........

Sanaa shines like the sun acting, and Wesley does okay acting making you think of some of his earlier works before the action films. This is like an Oxygen/Lifetime film with an HBO edge. Women will probably get lost in Wesley's character of Franklin but if you take the time he will make all the sense in the world.

Zora (named after the author Zora Neale Hurston) is a versatile lady who works as a music teacher, is an aspiring singer-songwriter, and mother. The film allows you to use your own imagination to make it work in many of the scenes.

In the end, I almost gave this film 3 stars but just like 'How Stella Got Her Groove Back' by Terry McMillan I love the challenges she presents in her African-American romance novels. This being more of a focus on socio-economics. Good but could have had less language.",1123372800,3,2023,4.571823204419889
1418385,4,B00005ASOO,"Compared to the book, the film left out a lot of things, which is understandable, but maybe not the right thing????? In the book, Franklin had a closer relationship w/his sister and that wasn't mentioned at all in the movie. Maybe seeing the other interaction with his family may have given viewers a bit more insight to that character. Wesley Snipes was good in the role, but should have kept his facial hair...at least a little.

Sanaa Lathan was great! I easily saw her as Zora and my heart went out to her as a single mother trying to survive and deal with Franklin's ever-changing moods.

We understand that it is not always easy to take a novel and turn it into a film and keep all aspects of the novel on the screen, but it's nice when you can read the book then see the film and know that it's just about all the same.

Overall, I was pleased.",1113264000,2,851,4.30625
1418386,2,B00005ASOO,"I won't give a long drawn out account on why this movie was bad for me, but one thing sticks out in my mind. The characters tried too hard to me. I love Sanna Latham, but it seems like she was forcing herself to convince us that she was really romantically involved with Wesley Snipes. With all the ups and downs of their relationship, I was praying that they just chalk the relationship up as a loss and move on.

After awhile it just get tiring ,you know, like a real relationship.

I much prefer the book. This movie doesn't hold a candle to the book. The book is as real as it gets. Pretty much how things are today.",1105056000,,620,4.158333333333333
1418387,3,B00005ASOO,"I'm not a huge Snipe's fan anyway, but I actually found myself turning away during their love scenes.  Wesley just doesn't have the appeal that makes it believable that Zora would fall for him in the first place.

Other than that, I thought the movie was okay.  I really felt for Zora, I think Sanaa did a good job portraying the emotions and frustrations of that character.  But again, it was hard to believe that she would fall for Wesley to begin with!",1090972800,4,455,4.445783132530121
1418388,2,B00005ASOO,"I have never read this book by Terry McMillan but I am told and sure it is better than this movie. I felt the main character Zora played by Sanaa Lathan makes ridiculous decisions in hooking up with a less ambitious Franklin protrayed by Wesley Snipes, whose character is basically a lying bum. I don't see how any female can be manipulated by Wesley's performance, and on top of that, Zora thinks she is marketable in landing a record deal in her late twenties and pregnant with a child. There are a couple of scenes that are great but they are far and between. Director Gina Prince-Bythewood has directed a pointless film that does not do Terry McMillan justice.",1090195200,2,664,4.588235294117647
1418389,5,B00005ASOO,this was one of the best of it's genre. i cried because i actually felt for these charectors. it is seriously sad and realistic.wesley snipes can act and shows it in this movie. highly reccomended if you need a movie to watch with your girl and you want to score points with her.,1055635200,4,279,4.283018867924528
1418390,3,B00005ASOO,I think that this could've been a better book if they stuck more the storyline of the book.  The book has the story taking place in the 80s.  Also I never pictured Wesley Snipes as Franklin.  I think there should've been a younger actor portrayed as Franklin.,1042675200,4,259,4.468085106382978
1418391,4,B00005ASOO,"This movie was excellent but flopped if you're judging it based on how true to the book it is. The movie outlines the general ideas expressed in the book. Of course a movie could never duplicate the preciseness included in a book but the necessary events in the book are in the movie.
Sanaa gives a stunning performance as Zora, an independant woman with ambition and a craving for some masculinity in her world. Wesley is Franklin, a man with a whole lotta ego, real-life problems and a weakness for beautiful women. Both Sanaa and Wesley are excellent in their roles. They give life to these Terry McMillan characters.
Perhaps the greatest gift this movie gives us is the possibility that you probably know a few Zora's and a few Franklin's! And knowing that allows one to connect with the absolute reality of the film. Get it! I applaud HBO for bringing this movie to the screen.",1041638400,2,882,4.624203821656051
1418392,5,B00005ASOO,"Sanaa Lathan and Wesley Snipes give this movie all the energy it needs. It's a story of love at first sight, love with problems and a man with a big ego. In other words: this movie is true to life!. I enjoyed the movie and I will own it on DVD, it's a good buy. It's too bad that is was an HBO movie, because it could have done well at the box office.",1040947200,5,351,3.7567567567567566

7935754,2,B00005ASOO,"I had a really hard time finding anything I liked about either of the main characters in this movie.  They kept their baby, and that was the best thing I could say for either of them.

You have to like the characters in a story on some level in order to develop emotional attachment enough to care what happens to them, thus making the story interesting. I just didn't develop that at all.

The story should have ended at ""I'm separated"". That means married. Relationship over, Mr. Adultery.

Instead of telling him to get back to taking care of his family, or even asking something as elementary as ""why are you separated"", our main lady invites him to live with her and keep him afloat until he can get on his feet...

What?

While they're shacking up and he's yet to be divorced and struggling to take care of the kids he already has, the main characters get pregnant.

It was just frustrating. Does this happen in real life? Sure. Should this type of story be romanticized and turned into entertainment? No.

And romanticized the movie makers did try to do, repeatedly, with sex scenes ad nauseum.

True romance is born of sacrifice of self for another, and while this movie's cover would like to convince us that this couple would likely exhibit sacrificial love, that is far from what took place.

Love to the main actors, whom I've seen in countless other movies that were actually good, but Disappearing Acts needs to be avoided.",1503705600,,1437,4.6
