1393101,5,B0000541TD,"""Fine"", the only DVD single released by Whitney is a very good, hip-hop song produced and written by Q-Tip. Whitney shows a level of soul never shown before. The video is dark and simple and lets the music shine through. Also included is one of my all time favorite Whitney vidoes, ""If I Told You That"", a duet with George Michael. This song, which is very danceable, shows Whitney and George Michael dancing in a club. It is a fun and well made video. The DVD also includes behind the scene footage of the ""Fine"" video shoot.",1000598400,4,526,4.43298969072165

7930727,5,B0000541TD,"Well worth the time and effort it took to find this DVD.  I always loved Whitney's *Just Whitney* album, and the song *Fine* has always been a favorite.  Whitney is, as always, totally awesome in this hip-hop video.  The extra behind the scenes footage was fun to watch.

*If I Told You That*, with George Michael, takes place in a club with both dancing.  Whitney looks beautiful, full of fun and big smiles.",1337731200,,409,4.5479452054794525

7930731,3,B0000541TD,"For Whitney Houston, the 90's brought her into experimental waters, browsing through Hip Hop & R&B together with My Love Is Your Love. Still, she did manage to use that element into songs for her Greatest Hits record. Unrealistically, the songs had a litte bit of a miss. Still, nowhere else could a diva of this magnatude go, except the media-made rival, Mariah Carey. The first video, Fine, was produced by R. Saddiq, from Toni Toni Toni fame. The song is very upbeat, and really proves that her voice does handle itself very well, but could really feel a little more upbeat to the rhythm. The video was directed by Kevin Bray, whom Houston worked with in several of her videos at the time, including Heartbreak Hotel, and I Learned From The Best.
The second video, If I Told You That, again had that feel. Unfortunately, the song felt a little bit manufactured than the first time out. This has nothing to do with Whitney Houston in any certain way. The song originally was conjured from her 1998 record, My Love Is Your Love. The song was remixed here, with a partner by the name of George Michael. The remixed feel doesn't really go together, after you heard the first version from My Love Is Your Love. Also directed by Kevin Bray, the video has a similar feel here as a party video, but nothing else to scorn at anyway.
The videos feel good as promotions for Whitney's Greatest Hits record for 2000. The only video that could've been added here was Could I Have This Kiss Forever, her duet with Enrique Iglesias. Still, there is nothing to sneeze at here, for any die hard Whitney Houston fanatic. This DVD single, was one of the first, but not really the best from her.",1077840000,2,1677,4.537953795379538
