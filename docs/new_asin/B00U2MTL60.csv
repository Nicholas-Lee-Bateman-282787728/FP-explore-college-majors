7027617,5,B00U2MTL60,"This is exactly what I needed to watch on a boring Saturday afternoon. Excellent. I am glad I watched the trailer because I thought this was just going to be another team of ghost hunters who bumble around in an old asylum or school or hospital and get their arses handed to them while whining and complaining the whole time. Not here. This team was the real deal. Magic exists. The lone woman in the group is psychic. They use protection markings to hold off the evil. If you've seen Supernatural then you may like this. These guys were not there hoping to prove the existence of ghosts, they already exist and they are a trained team from an institute that specializes in that kind of work. Good stuff. I was almost expecting the usual cheesy affair but this movie had good effects, good acting and a good storyline. This movie is right up my ally so I can't go any lower then maximum stars on this.",1449273600,4,901,4.401197604790419

7027619,3,B00U2MTL60,"Diverting cross between XFiles and Doctor Who but made on a tenth of the budget.
Impressive despite several laughable moments and some weak characterization (Ian especially badly worked out)
Parts of it reminded me of the 70s British show Omega Factor and this 2000 British TV pilot ""Rough Magik"" starring Paul Darrow, Gerrard McArthur, Tim Kirby.",1448928000,,347,5.214285714285714
7027620,5,B00U2MTL60,"A ghost hunter team sets up in a deserted school room. Jerry (Martin Delaney) is the team leader. he deals with ghosts with ""extreme prejudice."" He takes ""no sh@# from the here after."" Along with him is eye candy Anne (Lucy Cudden) the psychic; Ian (Alexander Perkins) the computer geek, and Mark (Simon Merrells) a seasoned camera man with a past.

It doesn't take long before this film turns into a short low budget ""1408.""

I liked the film. I liked the characters, dialogue, and acting, and flow of the film. I think a good ending twist could have generated a following.

7027621,5,B00U2MTL60,"A rarity in horror movies: it's driven by characters and story instead of cheap jump scares.  OK, so it was really predictable.  One character's death was foreshadowed in a blink-and-you-miss it vision.  One character I kept thinking ""Will the ghost please eat this whiny, annoying git already!""  Another I just knew early on would sacrifice himself so that the other would live.  But that predictability didn't affect my enjoyment of the movie at all.  (Except the whiny, annoying git lasted a little too long, imo.  I really hated him!  But props to an actor who can make me hate a character so much!)  Overall I enjoyed the minimalism.  It kept me interested a whole lot more than 15 people running around a huge building or forest tends to do.  5 characters in 1 room showing a story is incredibly effective when you have a good story.  I was pleasantly surprised!  Don't let it deter you that in the first 10 minutes you know what's going to happen to each character.  It's how they get there that makes it work so well!",1526428800,,1025,4.5911602209944755

7027624,4,B00U2MTL60,"I really liked this movie. I wasn't expecting much because I've seen so many ""ghosthunters investigating a haunted house"" movies that aren't well done, that it surprises me when I come across one that is a good movie.  This one had a pretty good story, plenty of scary scenes, and one I didn't know how it would turn out in the end. Don't get me wrong, though, it did have some of the same characters that do stupid things in movies, like why would you be so dumb as to go outside of the protective circle when you know your life is in danger and that everything you'd seen so far, was not what it seemed? One of the persons in particular, who should have known better, fell for that trick, that surprised me a bit. But I guess we can't always have people who do things right in these movies, or they'd all be kind of boring, wouldn't they?  But I do have to say, this movie is worth your time to watch, so sit back, try to relax, and keep the lights on while you watch it.",1524873600,2,973,4.142857142857143

I feel like this is much more akin to what the new Ghost Busters movie SHOULD have been. I do think that the cover art sort of betrays the feel of the movie & its content, (as it's a bit vague, generic, and boring...which this film most certainly is not); anyway, don't let that fool you.

7027643,4,B00U2MTL60,"A suprisingly good movie that leaves you wanting more.

I've learned to ignore the ratings most of the time, too many people expect every film even the low budget to be some blockbuster smash hit, or they go into it without reading a synopsis and then beg their time back.

This movie is actually pretty solid, not the greatest, but solid, and considering the acting takes place inside of one room, the cast actually pulls this off flawlessly.

What I would have liked to see more of, is backstory, or even a wrap up. This isn't your typical camera crew investigate a haunting kind of movie, this crew has actual training, but they never really get into the how, or the why; I would have loved more of that actually being explained.",1496793600,,732,4.53030303030303

Haunting introspection and character with self identification thru the eyes of those brave souls who work in this field abound as we live their steps & stratagems to not only survive but vanquish the antagonist. I was surprised how well the plot developed. The rating this film had was way too low. As with life, you get out of this film what you are willing to invest. If you only give it a few minutes to develop, write it off as low tech or dismiss it as simplistic then that is what, no doubt, you will leave with. Hang with it, however, and the chill factor will slowly creep into you physical and mental bones and leave you with a psychic dent in your armor. If you don't like films that honestly hit a little too close to your comfort zone, then don't watch this one and be on your merry way.

Apparently blood dries red, which annoys me about most horror films. Everyone knows blood dries a brownish color. That caveat aside, there was a good aspect to the movie. SPOILERS AHEAD: I found the idea that these ghost hunters worked for an organization that utilized some flavor of ceremonial magic (reminiscent of Supernatural with Demon traps et al) for protection. I wanted to know more about said organization. A better movie would have been the first hour showing them working at this organization and maybe closing a case. More character building and scene setting, with the big battle with the beast at the end. Seriously -- someone write THAT movie. Just sayin'...  Oh, and one last thing -- the tech guy seemed too fearful for someone who works for an organization that deals with supernatural phenomena.

7027683,4,B00U2MTL60,"Due to the poor ratings, I was really prepared to have a stinker on my hands, boy, was I surprised. From the cinematography, to the acting, to the story itself, the entire movie was really well done.

The movie takes place in a single room with a small handful of flash backs, as a team of ghost hunters arrive to investigate a haunting as well as shoot a training video for ghost hunters. They work for someone only known as the institute, which clearly has access to all things paranormal, psychic, religious and possibly even arcane.

Within that one room, they manage to craft a really wonderful story, with intresting side stories that shine a light on the world the characters live in, they explain the types of ghosts they can encounter, how to encounter them and more.

If there's only one thing I disliked about this movie, it's the fact I want to know more, I want to see more. Judas Ghost has an amazing concept that could easily be translated into some sort of mini series.",1475366400,6,985,4.522471910112359

While this movie never became as gory nor as horrific as Hostel did, it was still a quite enjoyable movie. We are introduced to the cast by way of their recording a training video for beginning ghost hunters. The opening line of ""Ghosts exist; whether you believe in them or not"" let's you know right away (and of course the idea behind the movie) that while this is starting as a simple training video, the team is going to be over their heads in no time at all, but then that's the whole reason we're watching this movie in the first place. :)

Horror - 2 of 5 Skulls : While this movie has horror elements, it did not keep me entirely riveted. Some viewers may appreciate the lack of shock-value gore in this one but be left wishing for better disbursements of actual horror to keep them awake at night.
Thriller - 2 of 5 Shots : This movie practically gives the ending at the beginning (no surprise), and there's quite a few plot-holes that might have made better movies.
Mystery - 1 of 5 Fedoras : Yeah, I'm not feeling the ""mystery"" tag with this one. After just a single viewing there's no surprise twists to even guess at.

Story - 3 out of 10 Coffee Stains
  Overall this movie is just like the reviewer ""moviesandbooks"" said. One to watch as some background noise. Given the single set, narrow story and obvious characters there's few good things to say. Unlike most NR-movies with small studios this one did a decent job in finding people who could deliver what they were given. As bad as this movie is, I'd rather re-watch this than that damn Grave Encounters. At least this one didn't make me wish I could punch people through the screen. Our heroes(?) delivers a small 'lux' to the small studio horror with just the right amount of over-the-top characters that are still within a *mostly* believable range.
  To break the norm I'll try and keep spoilers to a minimum. This movie focuses on a team of ghost hunters, but not the typical SyFy channel version. These are apparent researchers who represent an institute dedicated to the real-life study and extermination of all things paranormal. (Minus the zombies, witches and aliens...) This particular event gets out of hand and leads to a devastating loss to the team. That's basically the whole move in less than a paragraph.",1458864000,,1755,4.685064935064935

It was over kill in the end to show his friend who gave his life, channeling goodness, into God Light to get rid of the ""beast"". It would have been enough to just have the door slam shut.

This movie keeps you watching, which is not easy to do.  Granted some of the acting is over the top, but it is far from the horrid acting seen in many of the genre.

The special effects in general were cheap.  Two scenes appeared to offer some creative challenge. Still, nothing really special there.

Still, the movie did not let me go.  I felt I had to stick with it throughout.  And it definitely had the adrenalin flowing, even though fright was not the reason.  It is the experience.  People that like horror know this.  Horror doesn't scare the true fans, it just excites them.

The worst part about the film, and it is something I have seen elsewhere, is the incorporation of blood.  Large amounts of blood.  Blood is not fruit punch and that is what it looks like in this film.  Blood is thick and stains immediately.  It turns brown very quickly with oxidation.  It dries crusty and it looks absolutely nothing like what they used in this film.

This one, sadly, falls into the chaff, not the grain ... it's just a waste.  Using only one set (looks like an empty elementary school lunchroom), five pretty lame actors, a script that is silly at best, and one camera (or maybe just an iPhone) - come on, it just doesn't get lower budget than this.  Occasionally, really talented folks can do something great with a micro-budget (check out ""Tangerine""), but that didn't happen here, not by a long shot.  Only thing I liked:  the ghost hunters all worked for the 'Carnacki Institute' ... a wonderful homage to ""Carnacki the Ghost-Finder,"" a series of Victorian-style ghost stories written by William Hope Hodgson in 1913 or so.  The screenwriter at least has a good sense of his predecessors.  FYI: William Hope Hodgson was a remarkable person: bullied as a child, he pretty much invented body-building in the US; he wrote stunning supernatural and fantasy stories and novels (check out ""The House on the Borderland"" from 1908 and prepare to have your mind blown).  Sadly, he insisted on enlisting in the British Army in 1917 (WWl), even though at 39 he was well beyond the age of compulsory service) and was killed at leading a raid at Ypres the next year.

the movie was alright, and the concept was interesting, but the execution was shaky. and at times some of the acting was a little out of sink. and i found myself distracted by odd things, like wondering who the hell goes ghost hunting in a skin tight mini skirt?!
in a movie like this, where it takes place all in one room, characterization becomes far more important and sadly, the movie was lacking in that respect. i really didn't care much about any of them. even with only 4 characters present, two of them felt like placeholders (or red shirts), one of them had some humor, and one was kind of interesting.
my recommendation is to skip the movie and read the series instead, J.C., Happy, and Melody are far more engaging characters.",1450224000,2,861,4.561290322580645

7027794,5,B00U2MTL60,"Finally! A grrreat (!) horror/ghost flick. Very entertaining, almost worth wading through all the drek on Prime. Maybe it was low budget, but it was done extremely  well, with many great holy crap! moments. Unless you are one of the faux-critiques out there, you will probably enjoy this one.",1450051200,,292,4.959183673469388

7027796,5,B00U2MTL60,"A creepy horror movie, send shivers down my spine.  When they found those dead bodies, the ghost laughed and its face changed, really scared the s*** out of me.  I have seen a lot of horror movies, not many of them can bring me fear like this.",1449705600,,243,4.148936170212766
7027797,4,B00U2MTL60,"It's amazing what can be forgiven when the script and acting are good. I didn't have high hopes for Judas Ghost but was pleasantly surprised. The effects were impressive for a low budget film. It's short, but I'd prefer that to a film that's drawn out for no reason. The brevity kept the tension high. Overall, a quick but enjoyable film.",1449705600,,338,4.557377049180328
7027798,5,B00U2MTL60,"What a WONDERFUL surprise this was!

It's been a LONG time since I've watched a movie of this genre that I've enjoyed this much - the last being Oculus. There was nothing ground-breaking about the story, but how it was told is what won me over, plus the cast not only acted well, but they were all LIKE-ABLE - something sorely missing in the majority of movies like this.

I read another review complaining about the special effects - that they were obviously someone in makeup - and was reminiscent of a stage play. I agree with the stage play comparison, but this is part of what I enjoyed - instead of the use of CGI, everything was practical, as it should be! I compare this to old television shows, specifically The Outer Limits and Star Trek. The effects were not what was important - it was the stories and characters that were the focus and allowed me to be immersed.

Kudos to the director, cast, and all others involved in the making of this film. I watched it for free on Amazon Prime, but am now purchasing it, for they deserve it and will hopefully be an incentive to make more movies like this.",1449705600,4,1108,4.3951219512195125
7027799,4,B00U2MTL60,"If the lead character were more likable, would've rated it 5 stars. Hard to root for a cocky character in a Horror movie. Anyway, the movie itself was much better than I expected. Not scary or gory, most of the movie takes place in a single location but didn't feel like it.",1449360000,,274,4.288461538461538
7027800,2,B00U2MTL60,"The cover image has nothing to do with the movie....there is no ""creepy"" building.  (unfortunate as  I love a creepy building movie.) The entire thing is shot in one room, with minimal effects. However, it is not horrible.  It could be really bad, but miraculously the actors are okay -  Especially given that they had very little to work with in terms of plot, props or dialogue.  Okay for something to have on in the background while you do laundry, eat chips, check your emails, write thank you letters, sort mail, clean the ferret cage, alphabetize nail polish collection....that kind of thing.",1449273600,17,598,4.823529411764706

8704022,3,B00U2MTL60,"Well, not exactly -- it turns out they actually believe in the phenomena they end up encountering --  but the title does give you a decent idea of what to expect.  This is nothing great; as with most horror these days, the belief system that ""works"" for the main characters is a shallow mishmash of inconsistent elements, and there are few surprises, as it consists largely of stereotypes fulfilling tropes.  You should be able to guess who lives and who dies, and in what order, pretty quickly.  That said, most movies in this genre are absolute garbage; a so-so movie like this can look brilliant when compared with its competition.",1530921600,,634,4.736363636363636
8704023,4,B00U2MTL60,"I'm very selective of movies I download to watch again if I lose power; this was one. The biggest fault it had was in special effects, &, as plenty have already mentioned, the blood specifically. I'd rather they spend money on good actors & scrimp on effects though & that's what I'd guess happened here. Superb acting! I really enjoyed Martin Delaney's performance as Jerry. The whole ""institute"" idea was a nice twist on these types of movies. I didn't find it scary, but I rarely ever find any movie scary so I'm probably not the best judge of that. I did enjoy watching it though & I think you will too.",1529971200,,607,4.428571428571429
8704024,2,B00U2MTL60,This one was kind of dumb.  There were some good moments in the film but too few to make it worth the time to watch.  Some of it became just plain silly before it was over.,1529798400,,172,3.75
8704025,1,B00U2MTL60,"Don't even waste your time watching this. Nothing  but had script, ham actors, and possibly the first attempt by someone who has never directed anything before in their lifetime, perhaps funded by daddy's allowance.
