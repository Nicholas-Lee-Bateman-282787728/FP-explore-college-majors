It's a great narrative of US Ultimate Nationals in 1999 and 2000, and one of the first attempts to cover ultimate with high production values.  Kudos to Mike and Lance for taking the time to set the bar so high for future ultimate features.",1340323200,,283,4.529411764705882
8134933,2,B000GW8V8A,"I've heard in the past that this was a staple of Ultimate DVDs. Perhaps it is, but I own much better DVDs from ultivillage. The game footage is from poor angles and does not show complete games. There are better ultimate DVDs out there - don't buy this one.",1227657600,2,257,4.26530612244898
8134934,3,B000GW8V8A,"I have only played in one 10 week season but what I will say was lacking in this was more learning tools for beginners. The commentary tracks seem to be narrated by a clique who seem to make a few too many ""inside"" references for a newbie to relate to. I paraphrase but pointing out a girl in an action sequence and saying ""I love her"" really doesn't help me relate. I do get from this that the players are a strong knit community.

The action footage I would have liked to have seen was more of stack formations. Too often we don't see what the thrower sees downfield. For someone like me who is trying to learn how to run good routes, this DVD didn't help much.

There is a nice instructional DVD sold with a disc in most sporting goods chains. The name escapes me.",1203638400,2,767,4.210884353741497
