2234847,3,B0007R4SX6,"Peter Sellers was one of the most gifted British comic actors of his time, perfectly moving from costume to costume and accent to accent in a series of films that ranged from brilliant to awful. Australian actor Geoffery Rush's career shares much in common with Sellers', making Rush the only possible choice to portray Sellers in a feature film. From beginning to end, Rush rises to the occassion, giving us not only an adept portrayal of Sellers' behind the scene life, but also excellent impersonations of key Sellers characters such as Inspector Clouseau and Dr. Strangelove.

Sellers, despite his brilliance as an actor, led a deeply disturbing personal life. At times the screenplay downplays this, but Rush never shrinks from his responsibilities as an actor. Rush portrays a man willing to abandon his family for starlets, who takes pleasure in sarcasm and cruelty, and who has little light in his eyes except when he is in front of the camera. Rush alternates this mesmerizing, disturbing performance with expert recreations of scenes from classic Peter Sellers movies; Rush is so good at this that some of the recreations could pass as authentic footage. Rush deserves all the awards and praise he won for this virtuoso role.

However, director Stephen Hopkins' decision to focus almost exclusively on Rush's Sellers means that most of the supporting performances are superficial at best. Charlize Theron is wasted as Britt Ekland, given nothing to do but ""look pretty,"" and John Lithgow's campy version of Blake Edwards borders on the ridiculous. We're given no reason to care about these characters, nor is it explained why we should care about the monster that Sellers could be in his private life. The screenplay devolves into one tantrum after another, with little sense of dramatic purpose or drive. If I hadn't read a few Peter Sellers biographies, I would have thought the film was merely ""Peter Sellers Greatest Hits"" interspersed with nasty personal revelations. After seeing this film in its entirety I can understand why it did not merit an American theatrical release.

Still, Rush's presence makes the film worthwhile, and it's because of Rush that I can recommend this film to Peter Sellers buffs. Rush is a true virtuoso, and I will remember his disturbing performance long after I have forgotten this film.",1109376000,3,2333,5.0703125
2234848,5,B0007R4SX6,This is an underrated GEM of of a movie.  Geoffrey Rush's performance is spot-on.  Peter Seller's considerable talent was eclipsed by his many emotional problems.  The director and Rush do a superb job of capturing the inner torment that goes with constantly having to be funny.  All of the performances in the film are first-rate.,1108944000,,331,4.963636363636364
2234903,3,B0007R4SX6,"THE LIFE AND DEATH OF PETER SELLERS has a lot going for it - a superlative performance by Geoffrey Rush in the name part, a cleverly recreated ambiance of Fifties and Sixties Britain, and a clutch of good supporting performances, especially from Miriam Margolyes and Peter Vaughan as his parents and Charlize Theron as Britt Ekland.

Nonetheless Stephen Hopkins's film offers a superficial account of the life of a radio comic turned film star who never quite grew up. This is partly due to the assumption that Sellers was an iconic figure of the Sixties; hence many of the sequences of his life are staged in parody-Sixties style full of garish colors and tricksy cinematography. The truth is that Sellers would have made his name in any historical period, on account of his phenomenal talent for comedy.

His main shortcoming was an inability to separate his private and public lives; he always had to be giving a performance, even when at home with his first wife Anne (Emily Watson). Director Hopkins communicates this aspect of his character extremely well, especially during a sequence in a smashed-up living-room where he protests his undying love for her, after having had her followed by private detectives in a London street.

The film captures the role-playing aspect of Sellers's life by having Rush play all the people closest to the comedian (Anne, his mother, Stanley Kubrick) in short sequences addressed direct to camera. These offer Sellers the opportunity to rewrite history; to retell his life according to how he wanted it, rather than how it actually happened. This represents another aspect of his childlike personality; he could never accept that people wanted to live their own lives in their own ways, without necessarily kow-towing to his wishes. His father Bill (Peter Vaughan) offers a classic example; a mild-mannered but henpecked husband who never got the chance to tell Sellers how much he loved him.

There are some historical inaccuracies in the film: the GOON SHOW sequence is especially inept, with a studio audience laughing hysterically to order, on the directions of a stage manager. Hopkins has little or now idea how to recapture the mixture of sheer lunacy and surrealist humor that characterized the show. Sellers's two partners in crime Spike Milligan (Edward Tudor Pole), and Harry Secombe (Steve Pemberton) are colorlessly performed, overlooking the fact that Milligan continued to have a major influence on Sellers's life right up to Sellers's death in 1980.

The film wants us to believe that Sellers had no real personality; the roles he played on screen were the roles he liked to assume in real life. I don't buy that idea at all: from Rush's performance it seems that Sellers certainly possessed certain fixed traits, many of which were attributable to his over-protected upbringing. Like a child he reacted impulsively and often violently to any adverse situation; but that mood was followed by one of contrition, as he begged for forgiveness. It was part of his tragedy that he never realized how much hurt he caused people - especially his wives and his friends - and how they really did not want to associate with him any more. He died an isolated figure, the victim of his egotistical personality.",1460851200,,3255,5.009242144177449

2234940,1,B0007R4SX6,"Oh yes Geoffrey Rush is superb indeed.  But this poor excuse for a biography of a great comic actor does not deserve such a fine performance.  The Peter Sellers depicted in this film has NOT ONE positive attribute.  My God, even movies about Rommel or Hitler show that those monsters has some sensitivity.  But here is a complete and utter monster of egoism who treats everyone horribly, who has the charm of a rusty nail, who is mother obsessed.  According to this disgrace of a film Sellers never said a kind word about anybody.  He was an irritating scab whose wrechtedness was equalled only by his poverty of imagination.  Shame on the producers and writers of this sorry dreck.  Yes Peter Sellers had his demons.  He did have a terrible inferiority complex and could be difficult to work with.

Just went through his life, but didn't even really live true to who he really was (apparently, the special features helped me with this opinion).  It was kind of interesting, and touching at times, but also boring and unimaginative.",1359936000,,359,5.0508474576271185
2234953,5,B0007R4SX6,"I am a great Peter Sellers fan. Have been all my life. For that reason it was especially difficult to watch this film the first time I saw it. I couldn't believe he was such a monster in life. In fact I did not see it a second time for a long, long time. Then when I saw it a second time it clicked what a tortured, vulnerable person he apparently was in life; domineered by his mother, really unsure how to mange his life, not sure about anything, really.

I have no doubt that the picture is accurate. I remember watching an impromptu interview of Sellers taken at a dinner party, where he continually answered the questions in character -- some character -- and never in what could be construed as an authentic voice or personality. His genius of characterization was a defense mechanism to guard what must have been a very wounded frightened person, the end product of having ""surgically removing"" his real personality.

The film relapses into surrealism at times, which is totally appropriate. He was a surrealistic person; there, but not there; always alluding capture; never showing his true colors; constantly hiding behind his own characters; constantly looking for someone to take care of him, rejecting many. Who was the real Peter Sellers? You could never know, he probably didn't know, or didn't want to know, or like he would say, you can't go in there. Its all there in the film, brilliantly portrayed by Geoffrey Rush.",1333756800,9,1434,4.709163346613546
2234954,3,B0007R4SX6,"I had caught part of this on Sky and was eager to watch the full film but I'm a bit disappointed. For starters the breaking down of the fourth wall (the imaginary wall that symbolizes the separation of the audience and the actors), simply did NOT WORK AT ALL. It felt forced, trite and Rush looked non-campy and hideous. We are given so little background as to WHY Sellers was unprepared to deal with his fame and unparalleled talent and almost nothing about his later career which between The Optimists and Being There was his greatest work. This was a man who I have no doubt treated his family and children atrociously yet his talent (easily one of the greatest actors and all around entertainers who ever lived) makes his private life separate unlike all the others (Dali, Polanski, Crosby etc) who's artistry does NOT cancel out their abysmal behaviour. Why he was so gifted, how he honed this talent was never explored. Those are the gripes along with the digital eye candy which wears thin as London in the 60s and the 70s looked like that WITHOUT blue screen. Still, Sonia Aquino was a FANTASTIC Sophia Loren in fact NO ONE should attempt to be recreate her after this film. Theron was great as well as all the actors but they could not save such a generic and truncated bio-pic paint by numbers script.",1320451200,,1311,4.582978723404255
2234955,4,B0007R4SX6,"As a kid, I had a great time watching the Pink Panther during the 70s with the bumbling inspector played by Peter Sellers.

The Life And Death of Peter Sellers portrays him as a deeply troubled man whose problems are really caused by his own insecurity and extra large ego. Here's how:

* Sellers thinking he is awful in the film despite his director's assurances.

* His numerous tiffs with film directors.

* His roving eyes. He tells his daughter : ""I do love you but I love Sophia Loren more.""

* He heartlessly told his second wife Britt Ekland (Charlize Theron really looks like Britt) to get an abortion.

* While he managed to see his dad before he dies, he brushes off his mother's request to meet him when she was very ill. She dies making excuses for her famous son.

From the film, I thought Peter Sellers was really a difficult diva, hard to work and live with. Many of his problems are really self induced. Nonetheless, this is a great film and I was quite engrossed by the performances. At times, watching this  feels like getting an illicit thrill reading trashy tabloids or an unauthorized tell all book. However, the film do give a balanced view on the comic genius. While he is plagued with self doubt, there are also bizarre and larger then life shows of affection for his wives and children.",1318982400,2,1312,4.506329113924051
2234956,5,B0007R4SX6,If you only know this man from 'Pink Panther' this is worth watching for an insight into his fragile nature. Brilliant acting by all.,1307836800,,133,4.583333333333333
2234957,4,B0007R4SX6,"I didn't expect this biography to be so interesting but, then, I didn't know a lot about Peter Sellers' private life except for his marriage to Swedish beauty Britt Ekland. One thing that helped make this more interesting to me was that I grew up in Sellers' era in the '50s through the '70s and was familiar with all his films.

Sellers obviously led a strange life or they wouldn't have made a movie about it. I expected what I got: a look at a great film comedian but also a disturbed person underneath the comic image, one that wasn't so funny. Modern films (those since the late '60s) seem to almost sadistically delight in showing a famous person's bad points, more than his or her good. Thus, for many people, this probably wasn't a pleasant film to watch.

However, I didn't mind because I found Geoffrey Rush's acting so good, his portrayal of Sellers so credible and fascinating, that I could put up with some of the not-so-much fun to watch scenes. I don't think the latter was overemphasized, anyway.

Watching this film, I thought what a tragic figure was Sellers' mother ""Peg,"" played memorably by Miriam Margolyes. This actress gets almost no billing because she's isn't well-known and that's a pity because she is very good in here. In fact, she's the second ""star"" of this film. After that comes Charlize Theron as the aforementioned Ekland, Emily Watson as Sellers' first wife ""Anne;"" John Lithgow as ""Blake Edwards,"" Stanley Tucci as ""Stanley Kubrick,"" and other fine actors.

All the actors were excellent but this is still Rush's film. He dominates almost every scene, reminding me of his first big hit, ""Shine."" Kudos also goe to director Stephen Hopkins for a job well done.",1236816000,,1697,4.742372881355932
2234958,4,B0007R4SX6,"Director Stephen Hopkins and writers,  Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have come up with a marvelous theatrical conceit, (although it would never work on stage with all the drastic costume and make up changes) which has formed the basis of their screen adaption of Roger Lewis' labor of love, 'The Life & Death of Peter Sellers'.

Their idea is that Peter Sellers should play all the characters in the film that is about his life, which given his extraordinary ability to play multiple parts in a single film, is a logical extension of the man's ability and a valid approach. After each scene when Geoffrey Rush (Sellers)appears, the camera cuts, and the illusion that we are watching a film is peeled away to be replaced by the illusion that we are watching Peter Sellers become each of the other characters in his life,such as his parents and his first wife as he impersonates them. For a short while it's deceptively believable, until you realize the characters have been replaced by Sellers (Rush) speaking as he wished the other characters had spoken. The rationale for this is based on the premise that Sellers was completely egocentric, the center of his own universe who was dictatorial and attempted to manipulate everyone in his own life, not least his own wives and children.

It's an ingenious idea, but limited because Sellers didn't play unsympathetic characters on film, apart from the psychopathic, gangland boss in 'Never Let Go' (1959). Thereafter his characters were likable, but flawed individuals, invested with his own sense of humor and usually adorned with his vocal gifts, although 'Being There' is the obvious exception, when, stripped of voices and the characters of others, he played himself. While the effect of having Sellers impersonate  other characters does reveal the extent of his flawed nature, it does lend a somewhat stuttering pace to the film, hampered by the technique of Sellers 'complete' the thoughts of the other characters, if he were capable of controlling them.

Nevertheless, there is much to admire in Roger Levy's camerawork, full of dark interiors, the virtuoso performance of Geoffrey Rush, who gives more than a glimpse of Sellers' emptiness and insecurity. Emily Watson as his first wife Anne gives and understated, authoritative performance and Miriam Margoles as Peg exudes the smothering embrace, which Sellers struggled to escape from. Her portrayal sheds some light on why Sellers got away with such appalling behavior for so long; he was dominated and completely above reproach in his critical, formative years.

One consequence of watching the film is that it makes me want to seek out and reassess Sellers' forgotten movies, which sank without trace at the box office. I'm thinking of; 'Blockhouse', 'Hoffman', 'Where Does It Hurt?', 'After The Fox' and even 'A Day At The Beach' although he only played a brief cameo in that. For a more complete picture, Roger Lewis' book is worth reading.

Inevitably the final verdict on Sellers may elude easy categorization. He remains even more of an enigma, but there is also a sense of disappointment that his legacy isn't greater. Outrageously gifted, he lacked discipline, preferring to settle for easy laughs rather than having the patience to develop material fully and often losing interest in projects before their completion, which must also place a question mark over his judgment of film material.",1230076800,,3418,5.103756708407871
2234959,5,B0007R4SX6,"Geoffrey Rush is a brilliant acting genius. And this movie is a personal masterpiece for him.  The depth of each scene is fascinating.  Rush takes chances, using different film angles, breaking down the 4th wall, adopting new characters.  All this busyness could have killed a last talented actor/director. But Rush stitches it all together brilliantly.
I compare this movie to Citizen Kane. Each scene is a discussion in itself, and the scenes together create a something new again.

I was completely engaged during the whole movie, unexpectedly so. I started watching the movie as a biography of Peter Sellers. But 40 minutes into the movie, i realized i was watching something so much more.

This movie would be a great film-club movie, with friends watching and sharing different insights.  The discussion would go on and on.

After i was done watching, i watched it again, because i couldn't believe what had just happened. And the 2nd viewing was just as fascinating, as i picked up things i missed the 1st time around.

All the actors in this movie contribute to it's overall success.
I've never seen a poor performance by Geoff Rush. He shined in Pirates of the Caribbean, and in Munich as well.  He puts a lot into his craft.

This movie enters my all-time cinematic favorites:

2234960,3,B0007R4SX6,"This flick was depressing. Theron and Rush are quite good here, but the story just might pull you down. Sellers had it all, it seems to me, and yet failed to be happy about any of it.
How? Why?
Born unhappy and died unhappy.
Some folks are never satisfied, no matter what. Guy was married to a beautiful woman, had nice kids, terrific
career...yet, none of it made any difference.
Maybe he's finally found his peace of mind: six feet under.
Who knows?
Who cares?

You get one shot at this thing called life, and you gotta do what you can to find some happiness, some joy...because, really, it can't all be bad. What irks, what makes it frustrating,  is just this: as stated above, the guy had every reason to be happy...but wasn't.

There are people out there in this big world who have a lot less, who may even have less than that...but are able to be happy about something, at least.

Am almost tempted to go back and give this flick less than the three stars I gave it already. That would be short-changing Charlize Theron and Goeffrey Rush, so I can't bring myself to do it.",1207785600,,1078,4.375
2234961,2,B0007R4SX6,"Peter Sellers next to Chaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd is the best example of comedic talent in the world.  This film however paints him as a sad sex induced loser.  A role he is not.  If so, he should be portrayed in a more sympathetic way.",1200873600,,235,4.177777777777778
2234962,3,B0007R4SX6,"""The Life and Death of Peter Sellers,"" produced by HBO and BBC Films, has its moments, including a surreal scene in which Sellers has a near death vision populated by his assorted film characters, but it somehow misses the mark. There are times when I swore it was the late Sellers himself appearing in his own life story, but too often Geoffrey Rush is  obviously Geoffrey Rush pretending to be an actor whose face is more familiar to audiences than his own.

Although it would be impossible to dramatize any life without condensing certain events to save time, those familiar with the subject are tempted to wince at errors. Sellers' career stalled in the early `70s and was revived with 1975's ""Return of the Pink Panther,"" NOT the next year's ""The Pink Panther Strikes Again"" as the film claims. In an office where a nearly destitute Sellers meets with Blake Edwards (a bewigged John Lithgow), he rejects the script for the `76 Inspector Clouseau vehicle while Edwards holds up a poster for ""Where Does It Hurt?,"" a film that a studio executive (who is portrayed as rather stuffy and square, as execs are always portrayed in these Hollywood biopics) claims was not released. Actually, it was, briefly, in summer `72.

Did the screenwriters get it wrong or were the facts changed for dramatic effect and reasons of economy? Whatever their motive, it had me saying ""Wait a minute, that's not true."" I said that one time too many during the course of the film,"" enough for me to question the accuracy of the entire film.

I'd give Geoffrey Rush an A for effort for his performance, but I'd rather stick to the real Sellers.

2234986,4,B0007R4SX6,"Intelligent, imaginitive, gripping and bend-you-over double laughing effort by HBO Films.  Geoffrey Rush proves why he is a master craftsman, playing yet another mad genius...the brilliant comic and despicable human being that was Peter Sellers.  From BBC Radio days (The Goon Show) to fame and fortune as Inspector Clouseau (Pink Panther), Sellers delighted audiences around the globe.  In private, Sellers was a self-deluded, mama's boy,an enfant terrible to his various wives (and children),and directors (Stanley Kubrick and Blake Edwards).  Sellers' insecurities and selfishness, had him running to charlatan fortune tellers for business advice and telling his small children he was leaving them for Sophia Loren (apparently a one-sided fantasy that Ms. Loren did not share).

John Lithgow, as Blake Edwards and Rush as Sellers share some of the best scenes in the film.  The wonderful banter between the two (ex. Welcoming Rush to Cinecitta Film studios in Rome for the shooting of the ""Pink Panther"") Lithgow/Edwards:  Welcome to Hollywood.  Rush/Sellers:  But this is Rome.  Lithgow/Edwards:  Hollywood is a state of mind.

Charlize Theron is beyond beautiful as the fresh faced Swedish beauty Britt Eklund (""The Second Mrs. Peter Sellers""), and has next to no dialogue yet lends authenticity to swinging 1960's London.  Emily Watson as Ann Sellers, (1st wife) does not quite seem up to her usual affecting portrayals.  Miriam Margolies was spectacular as Peg Sellers, Peter's mother, whose life-long machinations, we are led to believe, created the meglomania that made Sellers a star and then destroyed him.

The deleted scenes in the DVD extras was marvelous because it included Emilia Fox's scenes.  Ms. Fox gives a splendid peformance as Sellers' fourth wife Lynne, who played a instrumental role in his last years.  That her scenes were relegated to the cutting room floor in final edits is really a shame.",1182988800,,1920,5.346666666666667
2234987,4,B0007R4SX6,"This is an extraordinary film.  It deals with a compelling subject.  It betrays juicy gossip about fascinating, famous people.  The exquisite design and art direction makes it a superb period piece.  And several of the performances--especially that of Geoffrey Rush--are nothing short of brilliant.

But in the end, the story lets it down.  It comes across as a rivetingly-acted documentary rather than a tale with a beginning, middle and an end.

Frankly, I think it starts too late.

Sellers relationship with his mother was truly creepy, and is rightly credited with his later craziness (which, today, we would probably call a borderline personality disorder). There are two scenes whioch depict it--including one where his mother sleeps with her son to symbolically usurp the role of his recently divorced wife. But neither of those scenes integrate well into the plot, and miss the opportunity to shed light on Sellers character.

As a result, Sellers just comes across as a serial abuser of women, rather than a tortured soul descending into madness, paralysed by grief and emptiness, infecting everyone he touches with his misery.

Further, though the movie starts with a Goon Show episode, it soon moves on to Sellers' later movie years.  My understanding is that the three Goons were lifelong frinds, and that radio comedy was his spiritual home.  Though of lower marquee value, this may have been more fruitful material to mine his character.

That said, the movie is redeemed by its performances--redeemed handsomely, in fact.  It bumps my rating from a three to a four.

Miriam Margoyles too-short exposure as Sellers' mother is excruciating to watch--in a good way.  Emily Watson delivers a poised performance as Sellers' first wife--we can sense the complex mixture of love and misgivings that her relationship with Sellers involved.

Many criticise Charlize Theron's performance as Britt Ekland.  Fair, I think, up to a point.  The Ekland character needed to be innocent--shallow, even--to have been so thoroughly infatuated with Sellers' superficial charm.  But to play her as a brainless blonde (which would make sense of the story) would no doubt insult a living actress, as well as giving her less room to show Ekland's developing emotional maturity as she began to realise the gravity of her situation.  Even so, Ekland has criticised the depiction of her marriage in the movie...and no wonder.  I would be surprised if it were possible to show it in a sympathetic light to all parties.

Rush, of course, is brilliant.  An actor of equal claibre, if not better, than his subject.

2234988,4,B0007R4SX6,"The film did an excellent job of lifting the dark curtain surrounding the comic genius of Peter Sellers.  My introduction to Peter Sellers was his wonderful work on the Goon Show.  I was a regular, tuning in on my homemade shortwave to the BBC home service.  Geoffrey Rush did an excellent job exploring the dark and twisting road that was the life of Peter Sellers.  Mr. Rush created a compelling if unsympathetic character.  My 18 year old son watched the movie with me, and he repeatedly said, ""what on Earth was wrong with Peter Sellers?""  After seeing the film, it was a very reasonable question, but maybe the character flaws found in Peter Sellers are more common than we think in the community of truly gifted comedians.  Carol Burnett once quipped that she went to a psychiatrist to discuss psychological issues, and, after pouring out her heart, she asked if the Dr. could help her.  He remarked that he could help her, but she would not be funny when he got done.  She left without further treatment.

A nicely done film, and I highly recommend it for fans of Peter Sellers.  My one caveat is that this is not a feel good film, and it is not one for the kiddies.",1165363200,2,1173,4.511848341232228

Geoffrey Rush is excellent(can't remember the last time he actually gave a BAD performance in fact) in the title role, as is virtually everything else about this movie: cast, direction, pacing, theme ... truly topnotch.  Charlize Theron is barely recongizable as the Swedish actress Britt Ekland who becomes Seller's second wife on the misunderstood advice of his psychic, buried under about 5 pounds of makeup --- as always though, she also puts in a stunning performance.

I was relieved to see that this was not yet another bland and playing-it-safe, feel-good hagiography like the biopics recently done about Johnny Cash and Ray Charles.  Peter Sellers had plenty of dark side, which this film tackles head-on and unapologetically.  It also takes many bold creative chances, veering away from straight biopic into the realm of surreal and metaphorical imagery/effects/scenes which thrust the viewer ever more deeply into Seller's twisted psyche.

2234990,4,B0007R4SX6,"""The Life and Death of Peter Sellers"" is a biographical picture starring Geoffery Rush as the comic character actor Peter Sellers, troubled star of the Goon Show, Dr Strangelove, the Pink Panther, and many others. This film follows him from the Goon Show in the 1950s to just before his death in 1980. But this is not your ordinary biographical picture, its potrayed as if Peter Sellers is directing the movie from beyond the grave, and somehow starring as all the characters, who give their comments about Sellers to the viewers in behind the scenes.... um... scenes within the film. Sounds a little complicated, and it took me a little while to understand what exactly was going on with that. I'm a Goon Show fan, so is my Dad, so I thought I'd give this film a look.

I thought it was a very informative, entertaining film, but if I didn't already know a little about Sellers life beforehand (who Stanley Kubrick was, who Peter Ustinov was, who David Niven was, who the Goon Show members were, what character voices Seller's was doing, etc) I would have been in the dark just a little bit. The pace of the film, particularly the early parts is rather fast, which is a shame, because I would have liked to see more of Seller's life when he was on the Goon Show with Spike Milligan (an equally troubled comic in real life) and Harry Secombe (a rather less troubled, Christian man). I would have loved to have seen Sellers in this film have had some conversation with Milligan and Seacombe, as it is they don't get a word in edgeways. They just appear in the background in a few scenes, (such as Seller's mother's funeral and at the Pink Panther sequel party) the actor playing Milligan looking sad and the actor playing Seacombe looking concerned, even baffled at Sellers' often eccentric behavior. I'm sure the actors playing them are great, you just don't get to see their full potential here Even just one decent conversation would have done me, the three of them together were good friends, and a really interesting bunch. Even if it had just been with Sellers and just one of them. No? Oh well.

As it is, the film tries to explore who Peter Sellers really was. How much of him reflected in his characters and movies? How much of his upbringing reflected in him? How can a man so child like at times completely ignore his children at times? Why did he love who he love, did what he did, impersonate who he impersonated? Themes along these lines. I can't say I'm the biggest fan of Geoffrey Rush (being an Australian actor gone to Hollywood, he gets an awful lot of hype down here down under, which doesn't help), but I liked him here. He does a lot of characters here, practically as many as Peter Sellers, though you can always tell its him by that nose and mouth of his.

Special features include two commentaries: one with director Stephen Hopkins and star Geoffery Rush, the other with writers Christopher Markus & Stephen McFreely (which I found the most interesting, as it had many more tidbits of information about Peter Sellers). There's also a selection of deleted scenes, most of them expanding on the idea of Peter Sellers/Geoffrey Rush playing both the people in his life and the crew of making the film itself (there's a scene for example involving two of the producers both played by Rush/Sellers discussing whether or not they should mention Sellers drug use and his third wife). If these scenes were in the film, they'd probably make things a little more disorentating for the viewer, well for me anyway. There's even an alternate opening in there, though the fact it opens the film with a sex scene probably is the reason why it wasn't used. Plus there's a making of documentary, with interviews with the cast and crew.

Recommended for fans of the Goons, Pink Panther and biography pictures, though you might want to do a little research on Mr Sellers before you watch, it'll help you to appreciate the film more, I'm sure.",1149724800,3,3947,4.626248216833096
2234991,1,B0007R4SX6,"I guess I should preface this review by saying that I watched this movie without any prior knowledge of Peter Sellers, so maybe I'm just not the intended audience. I thought maybe this film would be a good way to find about about him, but I've come away from it with no more of an idea of who the man was than I had going in. The film is basically just a boring guy doing lots of boring things, or making potentially interesting things boring, while surrounded by a constantly changing bunch of people who are almost as boring as he is. The editing was bizarre, making no attempt to present a coherent story. Most scenes had no relevence to anything that had happened in any previous scene, to such an extent that it wasn't apparent whether the scenes were even presented in chronological order or not. I guess if you're a fan of Peter Sellers you'll probably like this movie, but if you want or expect a cohesive, linear, interesting story you probably won't find anything to like about it.",1140393600,7,991,4.480662983425415

It shows the meddling by his mother, his neglect of his children, the delusion of a non-existent affair with Sophia Loren, the trashing of relationships/people who really cared about him, and finally his repudiation of his achievement in the Pink Panther films.

Although the scenes seem to jump about, the viewer gets enough to piece together Seller's approach to life. The scene where his mother visits the studio during the filming of Dr. Strangelove is quite revealing.

The DVD also includes some scenes that were omitted from the movie. After viewing them, I think the director made a good choice to leave them out.

All in all, it was interesting, but I wish I'd kept my illusions of Peter Sellers by not watching this. Despite that, his movies will remain favorites of mine.",1139184000,,893,4.900662251655629
2234993,4,B0007R4SX6,"****

This movie is a truly great movie, and I agree with other reviewers that it may even be brilliant because of the creative way that Peter Sellers' life story was told.  The acting, the story, everything was top-knotch.

However, it is also dark and depressing, because it is the story of a very disturbed man with a mental illness (possibly bipolar I, although the film doesn't say) and with a bizarre upbringing.  If you'd enjoy a deep exploration of how family life, relationships, and work life are affected by mental illness in someone who is truly and amazingly talented, you'll enjoy this movie.  That said, it was not uplifting for me, but somewhat depressing and very, very sad because of the nature of Peter Sellers' life, which was very realistically portrayed.

Still, if you look for quality and creativity in filmmaking, excellence in acting, and psychologocial explorations, you'll enjoy it.  Just don't watch it some night when you're down already or looking for a good laugh.

I've thought about it quite a while since watching it.  I loved its portrayal of the 1960's and 1970's, which I've lived through but forgotten many things (e.g., music, clothes, culture).  And I truly felt badly for Peter Sellers---who was such a brilliant but disturbed man---living in an era before medications and treatment were available to help his suffering and to prevent him from living anything remotely close to a happy life.

****",1137974400,2,1439,4.954166666666667
2234994,4,B0007R4SX6,"First off, the English subtitles have some glaring errors.  Many of the words spoken by the various actors DON'T make it to print, and others are just plain WRONG.  This may seem like a trifle matter, but for folks like my father who don't hear well and rely on those subtitles to follow the plot, this is a serious matter.

Second, the film's implication that Sellers' later films (in the '70's) were less brilliant than his earlier work I strongly disagree with.  Indeed, I think his performance in ""The Blockhouse"" is nothing short of STUNNING-among the finest of Sellers' entire career(and from reading the reviews others have written for it here in Amazon.com I'm certainly NOT alone in this opinion).

I agree that the film's portrayal of Sellers is truly horrific, yet one CAN see moments of genuine sweetness and vulnerability in this man.  Check out the hilarious scene where he is sauntering down the hotel corridors to Britt's hotel room, desperately trying to primp himself into an irresistible playboy BEFORE he gets there(""HELLO!  I'm PETER!  Peter Sellers!  But YOU can call me PETER!"")as he crashes into mirrors, etc.  And cad or not, I simply HAD to smile watching as he nervously awaited Sophia Loren's arrival at dinner, trying to fashion a white rose into a buttonaire for his dinner jacket, only to have it crumple into a hundred pieces in his sweaty hands(poor baby)!

I wish the screenwriters had based this film on Michael Sellers' excellent(and far more balanced)bio.  Though Michael DID NOT pull any punches showing the dark side of his father's personal life, he was also able to show those moments of  genuine warmth and vulnerability his father also possessed, making you understand WHY Sellers was able-despite his rages and often irrational, selfish behavior-to attract people to him so magnetically and to actually KEEP many friendships right up til his early demise(despite the film's implication he DID NOT die without close friends).

Another scene I LOVED in the film was where Rush as Sellers  performs ""I Haven't Told Her, She Hasn't Told Me"" in his mum's home, as he accompanies himself on ukelele.  In reality, Sellers LOVED to sing and play the ukelele, and he did a wonderful recording of this song that's NOT to be missed(you can find it on ""The Best Of Sellers"").

Overall, I really enjoyed watching Geoffrey Rush have a field day with his simply SMASHING portrayal here of Sellers!  I don't think ANYONE could have done better than he does here.  Of course, the fact I think Rush is one of THE SEXIEST(in the truest sense of the word)actors onscreen today made this a REAL TREAT for me to watch, as he gets his first chance onscreen to really ""strut his stuff"" with all the ladies(my lord, I've replayed THAT sex scene between him and Theron SOOO MANY times that now the disc kinda skips, tee hee)!",1135468800,3,2843,4.824742268041237
2234995,2,B0007R4SX6,"The acting is stunning. Rush is almost as amazing playing Peter Sellars as he is playing the other actors. He plays the other actors in terribly conceived bits where he (Rush) takes on the roles of other characters as they step out of the story and comment on it. The film fails for a few reasons: the take on Sellars is relentlessly negative, so we never care about him; the music is ham-fisted, the script is laughable. But everyone shines, Emily Watson, Charlize Theron, Stanley Tucci, Miriam Margoyles, everyone is great. Too bad this doesn't make the movie watchable.",1125964800,,572,4.787878787878788
2235026,5,B0007R4SX6,"It was about time someone remembered the great name of Peter Sellers. The movie tells you the ups and downs in the life of this great comedian, who was normally known among people who appreciate refined comedy. It's so sad to ask these days about Peter Sellers and find that most people either don't remember him, or know him at all. And it's even sadder to see that young people think that the upcoming Pink Panther movie is going to really be about the Pink Panther. Anyway, here you can find out that Peter Sellers was a comical genius and a very disturbed man on his private side. The movie shows you a face not known of the man of a thousand faces. His affairs, his tantrums, his heart and his alcohol problems. Great performances by Charlize Theron (who looks even more beautiful than in any other movie I've seen her before), Stanley Tucci and the great John Lithgow. No wonder Geoffrey Rush was given an award for his splendid performance, eventhough he looks a little bit older than the actor was in the young period of his life, there are times you don't see him, but Peter Sellers himself.",1125619200,,1100,4.505
2235027,5,B0007R4SX6,"""The Life and Death of Peter Sellers,"" directed by Stephen Hopkins, looks at the remarkable life of the actor who triumphed in such films as ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""Being There.""  The film covers Seller's early days in British radio, his troubled personal life, his marriages, his relationship with his parents, his box office successes, his craftsmanship as a performer, and his relationship with director Blake Edwards.  ""Life and Death"" opens up with a colorfully anarchic animated sequence (done to a swingin' Tom Jones song) and never loses its energy.

It takes a brilliant chameleon to play a brilliant chameleon, and Geoffrey Rush is amazing in the title role.  He creates a remarkable portrait as he not only portrays Sellers at different stages of his life, but also recreates some of Sellers' most famous screen roles.  Rush is ably supported by a stellar cast that includes Charlize Theron and Emily Watson.  In one of the film's most striking motifs, Rush temporarily takes over some of his costars' roles and seemingly plays Sellers playing various individuals in his life; this motif is itself a clever, and eerily effective, homage to Sellers' own ability to play multiple roles in a single film.

The film mixes together some of the standard biopic elements with some really surreal elements and sequences.  Overall it's a highly effective blend.  Sellers ultimately is portrayed as a volatile creative force, capable of destructive rages as well as of great charm, playfulness, and generosity.  His story is superbly complemented by a great soundtrack of evocative songs.  Visually the film is stunning to look at as it captures different decades that Sellers lived through.

The DVD of the film is loaded with great extras.  There are a number of really intriguing deleted scenes, including additional scenes of the versatile Rush taking on even more roles.  There are two excellent feature-length audio commentaries.  One is by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, who wrote the screenplay; the second is by Rush and director Hopkins.  The commentaries reveal fascinating details about Sellers' life and career, and about the making of the film.  Among the most interesting topics covered in the commentaries is the scrapped alternate opening for the film.  Ultimately, this film made me want to both revisit the Sellers classics that I have loved for years and check out the Sellers films that I have never seen.  ""Life and Death"" is a powerful, moving, entertaining, and thought-provoking tribute to one of the most amazing screen performers of the 20th century.",1125100800,20,2586,5.158273381294964
2235028,4,B0007R4SX6,"""The Life and Death of Peter Sellers"" is, simply and as the title strongly suggests, a movie based on the life of British actor Peter Sellers. Of course, we don't know exactly how accurate this film is, but we know for certain that many of the things it tells us about actually happened.

Who was Peter Sellers?. According to this movie, and to many people who knew him, Sellers was a brilliant actor, but also a troubled man who slowly started to lose his grip on reality.  Geoffrey Rush plays Sellers in different periods of his life, from his radio days in The Goon Show to when he started his filming career, spurred by his ambitious mother Peg (Miriam Margolyes). Sellers became well-known quite quickly, specially after playing Inspector Clouseau in ""The Pink Panther"". Unfortunately for him, as his fame grew so did his temper tantrums, that slowly alienated him from his family and friends. In the end, he didn't know who he was, or rather, he was merely the characters that he had played.

I would like to point out the fact that I think this movie has some splendid performances by a strong cast. First of all and more importantly, Geoffrey Rush is outstanding as Peter Sellers. Notwithstanding that, Emily Watson (as Anne Sellers, Peter's first wife), Charlize Theron (as Britt Ekland, his second wife), Miriam Margolyes (as Peter's mother) and John Lithgow (as director Blake Edwards) are also noteworthy in their roles, and help the spectator to forget that he is watching a movie, instead of glimpsing scenes from real life.

Stephen Hopkins, the director of ""The Life and Death of Peter Sellers"", mixes scenes of what could have been Peter's ""real life"", with Peter's recreations of those scenes from his own point of view. Hopkins also reproduces scenes from some of Sellers' films, something that I found specially enjoyable. All in all, I can say that the result is somewhat chaotic at times, but never boring. Whether you are a fan of Peter Sellers or not, I think that you are likely to enjoy this movie based on his life...

For one thing it's hard to know how much of it is true. Am I coming away with a deservedly negative picture of Sellers - or is it all skewed? I'm not really sure. I guess if I were more interested I'd look him up and read other books to find out, but the other problem is that I'm not that interested. By the end of this film I'm really quite tired of Peter Sellers. This film is too long. I agree with the person who sort of hope he died during his heart attacks. This is not to be unkind to the man. It's just that by that point in the film I was quite tired of Mr. Sellers and just wished it would end soon. It didn't, however. Anyway, Mr. Rush is great.

According to Stephen Hopkins film he was anybody his director and public wanted him to be; a little boy trapped in a man's suit who could adopt any persona and ""be"" that person. Geoffrey Rush gives a brilliant performance as Sellers. Unlike most movies, we see the most important moments in Sellers' life from his perspective; when a traumatic event happens (whether it be his wife saying she's leaving him, his mother dying, etc.) we ""see"" Sellers become that character and injecting what that moment meant to him. Ultimately, Sellers comes across as a self centered child who could and would become anyone to please those around him.

Hopkins complex but riveting film begins while Sellers is a member of the cast for The Goon Show on radio. Trying to break through to films, Sellers realizes the only way he can land a role that he wants as an elderly, daft gentlement is to show up already in character. Nobody knows who he is and he's immediately offered the role only then stepping out from behind the identity that he's assumed. As Sellers shoots to international stardom in ""The Mouse That Roared"" and in his signature role of Inspector Clouseau in ""The Pink Panther"", he also begins to lose control of his life distancing himself from his family and alienating his wife.

There is a question of separating the acting from the content.  Sellers appeared to be such a loathsome character, with no decency toward anyone (family, friend, business acquaintances) that my views of the movie is skewed by the disgust felt at the character.

When Chauncey appeared walking on water at the end of the movie, that appeared to be both what we wanted of Sellers, and what he thought of himself.

In THE LIFE AND DEATH OF PETER SELLERS, Geoffrey Rush plays his perception, or that of the screenwriters, of the British comedian. Here, Sellers comes across as such a Jerk that I'll go out of my way in the future to avoid watching any movie starring the actor simply because I dislike this film's version of the man so intensely. He came across as an obnoxious womanizer, who was, at various times, physically, emotionally, or verbally abusive of his son Michael (George Cicco, James Bentley), second wife Britt Ekland (Charlize Theron), and director Blake Edwards (John Lithgow). At one point, Sellers survives a severe heart attack that repeatedly stopped his ticker between multiple attempts of cardiac electroshock.

The film redeems itself somewhat in the end, but not enough to leave a lasting effect on me.

Geoffrey Rush does an excellent job at capturing the character of Peter Sellers - during some moments of the film (such as the Dr. Strangelove re-enactments) you truly think you're watching footage straight from the original.

I did enjoy finding out what kind of horrible man Peter Sellers really was (I won't go into details as not to ruin it). It makes me respect him as an actor much less, but it seems the awards knew about his true self as well because he only won one major award in his life, and that was very early in his career.

Peter Sellers is brilliantly portrayed by Oscar-winning Geoffrey Rush(Shine), who had turned in a multilayered and powerful performance. It's amazing that he could do so many impersonations. This film chronicles the family life, relationships, and career of Sellers.

Peter Sellers worked in radio before making his transition to acting in films in Britain. His first wife Anne is played by multiple Oscar-nominated Emily Watson(Breaking The Waves, Hilary and Jackie), who managed to steal some scenes, and appeared in mostly the first half hour. Sellers is an emotionally unstable man, and his relationship with his family is quite volatile. His overwhelming passion for acting made him neglectful towards his family, and he divorced his wife when he tried to pursued his co-star Sophia Loren(Sonia Aquino, who is a total SL look alike).

He eventually make his crossover from Britain to Hollywood, and he was a sensation with his debut film The Pink Panther in which he played a supporting role that allowed him to steal the movie. During his rise in Hollywood, he takes the advice of psychic Maurice Woodruff(Stephen Fry) and pursued a bombshell actress Brit Ekland(Charlize Theron), who would become his second wife. Their marriage didn't last long dued to personality differences.

At the peak of his career, he worked with famous directors including Blake Edwards(John Edwards) and Stanley Kubrick(Stanley Tucci). His last sentimental dramedy Being There garnered him an Oscar nomination.  His personal life was a disaster, and he emotionally abandoned his unconditionally loving mother Peg(Miriam Margolyes). He was did cocain and had  casual sex with many women. We also get see a lot of his on set filming experiences.

2235058,5,B0007R4SX6,"Peter Sellers is my all-time favorite screen comedian.  I'm familiar with his early Ealing work to ""Being There"".  I approached this film with great skepticism because I did not think it possible to recreate his unique genius.  Geoffrey Rush would not appear to be the ideal choice to play Sellers.  He neither looks or has the vocal patterns of Sellers.  During the initial stages of this film it's hard to overlook this but as the film progresses Rush slowly morphs into your mind that he is Peter Sellers.  It's not so much in the recreation of Sellers' famed film roles but in his depiction of his personal life.  To those unfamiliar with Sellers he was a manic-depressive.  Sellers creativity was unfortunately fueled by his insecurity and self-loathing.  Where I think this is an important film is not so much as biography of Sellers but as a vehicle to shed light on the personal hell that life is for the clinically depressed, where, in this case, you happen to be the world's most famous comedian.  Though this film is essentially a showcase for Rush, the supporting cast is uniformly superb.  Where do I begin?  Kudos to Emily Watson, Charlize Theron, Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow, Miriam Margulyes, and Stephen Fry.  Director Stephen Hopkins directs this film stylishly but I do quibble with some of the film's continuity problems.  Some of the events are chronologically out of order.  For instance, ""The Pink Panther"" was made after ""Dr. Strangelove"".  Also, a scene attributed to ""The Pink Panther"" was actually from ""A Shot in the Dark"".

Peter Sellers (a brilliant Geoffrey Rush who is such a fine actor that he doesn't try to impersonate Sellers, rather interpret him) was one strange man.  His foibles in life are more interesting than the fascinating characters he created on film, characters that are still being imitated by such actors as Steve Martin, etc.  He was a disturbed man, with a more than bizarre relationship with his mother (Miriam Margolyes), his directors Stanley Kubrick (Stanley Tucci) and Blake Edwards (John Lithgow) and abusive relationship with his wife Anne (the always superb Emily Watson) and his tryst with Britt Ekland (Charlize Theron).

At times in this rather cumbersome script the film loses focus with a too heavily weighted angst that besmirched Sellers life.  His abominable behavior patterns and generally inappropriate responses to those who would make him a star, while expertly crafted by Geoffrey Rush into complete credibility, are not relieved by sufficient moments of comedy, moments that made this actor famous in the first place.

The acting is uniformly excellent, far better than the script would suggest, and the glamour of the 1960s excesses is well captured though degenerate to see again.  But for all that, this is a well-done look at the life of a comedic genius whose screen presence was probably the only real thing about him.  Grady Harp, May 05",1115769600,3,1612,5.075757575757576
2235060,5,B0007R4SX6,"In the world of screen comedians, Peter Sellers is the undisputed king. In films both classic (Dr. Strangelove, The Pink Panther series) and horrible (Fu Manchu, various others), Sellers excelled at playing multiple characters. The one character he couldn't master, however, was himself.

In ""The Life and Death of Peter Sellers"", Geoffrey Rush goes above and beyond in his portrayal of the comic legend whose private life was an unadulturated mess. Rush is less a perfect clone of Sellers physically than a gifted interpreter of the man. Whatever quibbles there may be with the story and its problems (and there are a few), Rush's performance is mannered and detailed enough to make such things minsicule. He is born to play this role, and he captures the enigma behind the public face as best as anyone can hope to do.

The story, while accurate in several details, feels a bit disjointed to anyone familiar with Sellers's story. There are some major discrepencies in time and chronology, but as I said before, Rush's performance puts such notions to rest in terms of taking away from the film. As explained in the commentary with the director and Rush, there was so much material that they wanted to get in that certain fudgings had to be allowed for. In that sense, this is not the definitive biography. But chances are no one will ever come close to a ""definitive"" look (that would take more than the generous two hours the film has to look at what Sellers went through).

The supporting cast is indeed peripheral, as it should be; in a film by Peter Sellers about Peter Sellers starring Peter Sellers (as the plot alleges), such details as to what went on normally between him and those around him are dull compared to the excitement he had in creating his characters. Emily Watson is a stand-out as Sellers's first wife Anne, and Stephen Fry makes the most out of his minor role as a charlatan psychic. It is Stanley Tucci as Kubrick, however, who has the most impact in his brief but memorable section of the film with Sellers while they film the masterpiece ""Dr. Strangelove"". The only real recurring character besides Anne is Jon Lithgow as Blake Edwards, who proved to be Sellers's foil in real life. Lithgow adds some dimension to what could otherwise be a flashy one-trick part (check out the last scene of the film).

In all, the film is not perfect, nor is the DVD (the inclusion of a detailed documentary on Sellers, rather than the flashy and brief ""making of"", would have been appreciated, and also something featuring his surviving family would have been nice considering Michael Sellers did such a great job with his memoir of life with his father). But it stands as a great tribute (warts and all) to the most dynamice screen comedian of all time and the demons that hounded him to the grave. Peter Sellers may not have been the sanest person or the most loving in the world, but in his career he managed to bring laughter to millions. That this film captures his life as best it can is a testimony to his continuing importance. This is worth seeing for that alone.",1115769600,3,3086,4.6881918819188195
2235061,4,B0007R4SX6,"Addendum 6/5/05  Take what you will from this powerhouse of a movie; as a fan of Sellers the Actor since childhood, I found that it inspired me to do exactly what Geoffrey Rush describes the writers as having done: try and get inside the head of Peter Sellers. WOW! I never had any idea what a troubled life he had. Rather than leaving me feeling like ""what a jerk!"", this disturbing film spawned my compassion and a need to understand this man for whom I feel such an affinity. But hey! I'm just a Virgo who shares her birthday with Sophia Loren.  :)

Before you watch this, might I offer this suggestion: Consider the scope of your own life: the highs, the lows, your triumphs and successes, your challenges and failures, strengths and shortcomings. The day upon day that slowly unfolds into a lifetime. Do you believe that a two-hour movie that ignored the first 20 years of your life could fairly portray the experiences, feelings and emotions that make you what you are? And who is telling your story: your best friend, worst enemy or someone in the gray in-between?

All I am saying is, give Pete a chance.

If you would know more about Sellers after viewing this, seek out the region 2 BBC dvd ""The Peter Sellers Story...As He Filmed It"" (Try amazon.co.uk) I'd bet money it figured heavily upon this one. The only U.S. documentary available on dvd is The Unknown Peter Sellers  End Addendum

My first reaction upon hearing that Geoffrey Rush was portraying Peter Sellers in this HBO film was one of disbelief.  There's a photo in Lewis' book, on which this movie is based, no less, where Sellers is a dead ringer for Al Pacino (but one struggles to imagine him taking on the vocal challenges posed here). Though I'm sure he's considerably taller, and, in his words, ""less hairy,"" than Sellers, Rush brilliantly captures something about the man, as well as the other characters he has to take on in exploring Sellers' inner circle. I believe Geoffrey Rush gives one of the finest performances ever to epitomize the craft of acting here, precisely because he transcends his differences with Sellers to so convincingly evoke Peter's spirit. I agree with Blake Edwards' assessment that there were moments when ""(Rush) was Peter.""

Having said that, and having grown up watching Sellers' movies, I still must point out several aspects that were impossible for Rush to convey that made Peter Sellers so singular:  He was disarmingly handsome and had (in the words of his first wife) ""the charm of the devil""; his voice was like Dewar's Signature, and he could vocally and physically adapt a different persona with an ease that is absolutely mind-boggling. He always made you feel his performances. Consider the scene from the first Panther movie, where Clouseau spins the globe. Watch Rush do it--and then go back and watch Sellers do it.  Peter does it with a fluid, visceral momentum that sweeps you along-then he springs back up as lithely as--dare I say it?--a panther. Rush, by comparison, is clunky and mechanical.

The production goes a long way to enhance Rush's already formidable turn, with the music and artwork well-chosen to evoke the times being portrayed. I also thought that the narrative devices--Rush playing Sellers as the characters around himself to convey his lack of identity, the car-shopping for women scene--were very effective. The pairing of music with various scenes was stupendous: ""What's New, Pussycat?"" with the cartoonish opening credits (given that Sellers' heart stopped 8 times during his April 1964 heart attack, the image of him as a hissing cat is particularly apropos); ""Love is a Many-Splendored Thing"" as Sellers meets Sophia Loren; ""The Girl from Ipanema"" as Sellers romps wistfully with Britt Ekland; ""It's my life and I'll do what I Want"" while Sellers defiantly lifts weights after the heart attack.

Rush rises from the ashes of Lewis' pathetically harsh and misdirected tome. While I have no doubt that Sellers was a troubled, tortured and frightfully self-indulgent man in his personal life, fortunately, I never had to know him in that capacity.  The Peter Sellers that most of the world will know--should know--Peter Sellers the Film Star--is a man who brought an incredible amount of laughter and joyous revelry to this planet. And I think Rush manages to make us sympathetic, but the source material is so laden with venom on every page, it's a wonder he did. In a behind-the-scenes documentary short, Rush refers to Sellers as ""this man of a thousand faces""--in my opinion, a spot-on equation with the screen great whom Peter was the sounded version of--Lon Chaney.

If this very well executed film does anything, let it send you out to revisit a Sellers movie first-hand. Look at any three of his films (allowing only one Panther) and you will see three amazingly different performances (probably more). I suggest Dr. Strangelove, The Party, and A Shot in the Dark. This is a man that--warts, and all--is well worth remembering as one of the greatest actors ever.",1114387200,4,5020,4.882491186839013
2235062,3,B0007R4SX6,"Having read the book on which this film is based, I was very interested to see how it could be done.  After all Sellers, according to the book and most other sources, was a man who (himself confessed) had no personality of his own (""I had the 'real me' surgically removed years ago"") and who's only redeeming feature seemed to be his ability to create a character.  That these two facets of him worked hand-in-hand and that he seemed to 'play' various different versions of himself over the course of his personnal life seems to be the sad fact of his existance and the main point of the film.

Shown to be basically a sad and petulant little mother's boy who never grew up, the film will win Sellers no fans for his personality. The events of his life that are crammed into the two-or-so running time leave a real bad taste in the mouth - smashing his son's toys as a revenge on an innocent mistake, beating wife Britt Ekland, obsessing over Sophia Loren, shying away from his mother as she lies dying, publically humiliating Blake Edwards - the list is depressingly long.

This leads to the main flaw in the film - how to make an interesting and 'lovable' central character out of a self-destructive, totally selfish person. Its impossible but the film wins out by lovingly reproducing a large amount of Sellers' original characters onto the chameleon-like Geoffrey (should have at least been Oscar nominated for this role) Rush. The Pink Panther(and its sequels), Dr. Strangelove, Being There, After the Fox, The Millionairess, The Ladykillers, Charlton Brown of the F. O., The Mouse That Roared and I'm Alright Jack are the main films that are visited over the course of the film, with clips re-filmed to give an authentic feel - with the help of these the film should at least win some fans of his professional work. Some of the characters burst out of the confines of their own film - mainly in a bizarre dream sequence - and Rush also takes on the personality (and image) of several of the real-life characters in the film to illustrate Sellers' distance from reality. This doesn't always work but is an excellent devise when he portrays the first Mrs. Sellers and shows his wish to alter real events and as his mother, showing her journey from death-bed to death.

The recreation of the swinging sixties and seventies is also great although (particularly in a scene where he photographs Ekland) Sellers sometimes comes across as an Austin Powers prototype - which he probably was. A wonderfully over the top 'car showroom fantasy' is one of the film's guilty highlights!

Rush is excellent as Sellers and his many different personnal and professional guises. The make-up on both the recreation of the characters and the effort to change Sellers actual appearance as he loses weight and grows older is superb. (That none of the other people in the film seem to age - especially the children - is probably an interesting illustration but just left me slightly confused as to a time-scale.) The supporting cast are all excellent but this is Rush's film all the way and there is an obvious relish as he grapples with a role like no other.

The main problem with this film is the cold heart and bad taste that it leaves you with at the end. For a man that gave so much pleasure to millions of people that he never met, he certainly made those he knew suffer. On a positive note, it did make me want to revisit his films and enjoy them again. I am certain that, with the great talent he had, the real Mr Sellers can make me forgive and forget as he makes me laugh - something that seems to have got him through life.",1113264000,4,3618,4.591331269349845
2235063,4,B0007R4SX6,"So said Blake Edwards in a short documentary I saw about THE LIFE & DEATH OF PETER SELLERS.

I've always been a big fan of Sellers' best work, like LOLITA, DR. STRANGELOVE, and THE PINK PANTHER STRIKES AGAIN, but just about everything I've read about him talks about how disturbed and destructive he was.

(I just read a section of Gene Wilder's new autobiography and he talks about Sellers stabbed him in the back in the 1970's, so it's amazing how much human wreckage the man left behind).

But I could pop in my DR. STRANGELOVE DVD right now and watch his scenes over and over again.  It's an inspired comic performance that I never get tired of.

Geoffrey Rush does a phenomenal job of not only playing Sellers and his famous characters, but he also becomes almost everyone else in Sellers' life--as Sellers would have preferred them to be as he revises their role in his life.  (Sounds confusing, but it worked for me).

If this film interests you enough to read more about him, I'd recommend Ed Sikov's MR. STRANGELOVE over Roger Lewis' THE LIFE & DEATH OF PETER SELLERS.  (I read the original British 1000-page plus Lewis book and was very disappointed).

I remember feeling sad in the summer of 1980 when I'd heard that Peter Sellers had died.

I now wonder how the people who had to endure him felt at the time....",1112745600,,1323,4.544303797468355
2235064,5,B0007R4SX6,"Geoffrey Rush will no doubt win every award available to him in this bravura performance for this BBC/HBO production. Based on the rather tabloid-sleaze biography by Roger Lewis, it presents a portrait of a demented, self-obsessed man who hurts everyone he comes in contact with. Taking into consideration the final facts stated in the film (he left his children $ 2,000.00 apiece) there is probably more truth than one would care to believe in this account of Peter Sellers, which starts with his appearances on The Goon Show, shows his twisted relationship with his mother, the women he abused in various ways, his difficult behavior on the movie sets, and ends during the time of ""Being There"", the award-winning 1979 film about a gardener who becomes a politician.

Geoffrey Rush is phenomenal as Sellers; and I especially like the scenes when he becomes his mother, as well as Blake Edwards. Rush is made to look somewhat like Sellers, but it is the body language and the verbal inflection that makes this portrayal so convincing.

Others in the cast are also excellent: Miriam Margoyles as his mother, Emily Watson as wife # 1, Charlize Theron as Britt Ekland, Stanley Tucci as Stanley Kubrick, Stephen Fry amusing as celebrity psychic Maurice Woodruff, and the very underrated John Lithgow once again terrific as Blake Edwards. Sonia Aquino is impressive in the small part of Sophia Loren.

The direction by Stephen Hopkins is stylish and well-paced, and the score by Richard Hartley is peppered with Tom Jones singing ""It's Not Unusual"", and other songs that fit into the timeline from The Animals, The Kinks, and more.

A way above average Cable TV production, it's a riveting look at a great talent gone wrong, and a ""must see"" for Rush's performance alone. Total running time is 122 minutes.",1110067200,59,1802,4.9372937293729375
2235065,4,B0007R4SX6,"BBC Films / HBO Films present a slightly unconventioanl biographical film of cultural icon Peter Sellers, featuring perfectly cast Geoffrey Rush as Sellers, Emily Watson as Anne Sellers (his first wife), Charlize Theron as Brit Ekland, Miriam Margolyes as his mother Peg Sellers, and Peter Vaughan as father Bill Sellers.  Some of the real-life persons who influenced, and were influenced by Sellers are also played by the interesting cast, most notably Blake Edwards by John Lithgow and Stanley Kubrick by Stanley Tucci.

If you know something about Peter Sellers, you will realize that the film's power comes from Geoffrey Rush who has become Sellers himself.  In fact, this picture is all about Sellers/Rush, and Sellers' troubled personalities, alarmingly close relations with his mother, and incredibly naive (and inconsiderate) way of treating people around him, are funny,  fascinating, off-putting, or all in one.

The bio-pic completely ignores the childhood of Sellers, and after the opening credits (with delightful animations) it jumps straight to the days of the popular BBC radio show.  Then, you see his humiliating audition for the film (and his tactful revenge), meeting with Sophia Loren and a fortune teller (cameo by Stephen Fry), Hollywood and the successful 'Pink Panther' series, Stanley Kubrick and his legendary triple roles, and 'B.E.'  The film follows the events of his life, but you may feel that some integral parts are missing from that.

The superficial touch, if any, is owing to the fact that the film presents Peter Sellers as a man without self.  His face is, so to speak, 'surgically removed' and there is no identity, no real Peter Sellers in him.  According to the interpretaion of the film, that's why he can be in character so easily and convincingly.

[GIMMICKS GALORE] Director Stephen Hopkins ('Lost in Space') introduced very unusual method to explain the genius of Sellers.  Geoffrey Rush, at certain points of the story, becomes other characters one after another (such as tormented wife Anne), and HE (Sellers) gives us his ideas about the incidents or the characters he mimics.  Do we really need this strange method when Rush is so fantastic?  And, sorry to say this, but why the director of 'Lost In Space' in the first place?

In addition to the inspired acting from Geoffrey Rush, there are several merits you can find in 'The Life and Death of Peter Sellers.'  Though you have to wait for one hour to meet her, Charlize Theron is excellent as Brit Ekland with short blonde hair, sporting accent.  Some original films of Peter Sellers are re-created in detail, and one sequence presents exactly the same scene of Kubrick's 'Dr. Strangelove,' where the US president very timidly talks over the phone about the emergent situations.

'The Life and Death of Peter Seellers' is often hard to watch, especially when it shows Sellers' nervous, irresponsible, and even childish personality, and his wife-beating too.  But Geoffrey Rush's magnificient acting as Sellers would make us forget such defects as some of the misguided direction, and rather simplified ideas about the nature of being genius.  See the hilarious scene (perhaps fictional) in which English Sellers transforms his outer image into French Clouseau in an airplane, deceiving the bewildered flight attendant.  It's a small gem.
