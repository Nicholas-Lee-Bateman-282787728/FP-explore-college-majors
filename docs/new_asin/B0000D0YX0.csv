1920462,4,B0000D0YX0,"Director Gonick has some imagination....the story is about a gay dj wondering a nightmarish town with some of the weirdest characters I have seen since some old John Water's movies.....this is by far not a Water's film but It strikes the imagination and has some very funny camp comedy.  Oh, back to the story...the dj decides to sleep with 2000 men before a great flood swallows the town ....ok enough, just watch the movie and see if you can make sense of the all weird and craziness that is Hey, Happy!  Looking forward to the Dvd to freak out my friends.!!!!",1024185600,,562,4.554455445544554
1920463,5,B0000D0YX0,Hey Happy ! is that rare type of film that crosses all boundries but in a metaphysical way. It is the journey of a very hot DJ named Sabu (played by Jeremie Yuen) that is on a mission to bed 2000 men. He encounters every type of person in our culture along the way but still completes his mission when he meets Happy. I don't want to spoil the ending but for anyone curious about the outer fringes of the Gay culture this is a must see film ! I was lucky enough to catch it on Bravo and hopefully someday [...] I want this in my permanent DVD collection....,1024099200,3,557,4.072727272727272

7999737,5,B0000D0YX0,"What a wonderful discovery!  Noam Gonick has designed a film which is impressive in every way.  It is shot in 16mm Cinemascope with expansive shots of the prairies around Winnipeg, and its railroads.  The design is striking, and the colors vivid against the bleak post-industrial, pre-apocalyptic locations.  The score is varied and descriptive.  The story is a wonderfully curious blend of science fiction, sadism, and romance, with glances over the shoulder towards Fellini's 'Satyricon' and Kubrick's '2001'.

Mr. Gonick has put together a cast which could not be improved upon.  The title role of Happy, a Parsifal-like innocent who communes with aliens through his short-wave radio, is sweetly played by Craig Aftanas.  Clayton Godson, as Spanky the vicious queen, is appropriately outrageous.  John Simone as Ricky G, the owner of an outdoor XXX store, is (especially when he laughs) a cross between Paul Lynde and the undertaker in Bruce LaBruce's equally stunning fantasy, Hustler White.  But the centerpiece of the film is certainly Jeremie Yuen as Sabu, the stunningly sexy and sensual prairie boy on a personal quest to bed his 2000th man.

When Sabu falls in love with Happy, Spanky (who wants Happy for himself) goes ballistic.  Their lopsided triangle is played out against the background of an impending flood and the planning of a final rave, bringing nihilistic and biblical overtones to Mr. Gonick's allegory.  Happy is told that, if he gives himself to Sabu, the aliens will take him with them.  His romantic encounters with Sabu lend lovely moments of tenderness and affection to the film, plus a bit of serenity in the midst of the surrounding madness.

Mr. Gonick's delightful little gem joins, in my mind, Curtis Wehrfritz's '4 Days' as two of Canada's finest indies.  I love Bruce LaBruce, but these very special works cannot be topped for sheer imagination of conception, remarkable design of production and, above all, the beauty of their respective leads.",1092441600,5,1982,5.146875
7999738,1,B0000D0YX0,"I have no idea what to make of this movie. Should I think of it intellectually as a modern, messed fairytale, or some weird allegory for a degradation in society that fears losing all that it holds dear... No, I think this is just poor cinema, with no sets... little plot that makes any sense, and characters that you can't even remotely care about! This is one of the top 10 worst films I have ever seen! And it's a disgrace to quality Canadian cinema. The only saving grace is Spanky - a twisted Male version of the Wicked witch of the West. But sadly, even his over-the-top performance can't save this film.",1075766400,5,610,4.407079646017699
7999739,5,B0000D0YX0,"ok, so i was extremely lucky to have seen this on my canadian satellite, considering the fact that it IS a canadian independant film, and i was speechless as to describe it.  it seems like something made under the influence of drugs, but it is a great movie anyways.  i won't say anything about it cause you have to see it yourself.  but pick it up if you want some good film.  and a lot of the screen shots are gorgeous, like when Sabut is in front of the red truck...truly gorgeous (as is Jeremie Yuen aka. Sabu)  great movie, great comedy, and someewhat dark.  Highly Recomended!!!",1074729600,,584,4.411214953271028
