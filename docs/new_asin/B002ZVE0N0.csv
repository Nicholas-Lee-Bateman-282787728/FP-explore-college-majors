8417707,5,B002ZVE0N0,"This disc includes two Potomac Autumns, as well as a Rock Creek Autumn and then Alexandria Halloween. Having always been a fan of Maddy Venture's Autumn shots, I went ahead and got this disc. Was not disappointed! The Autumns are beautiful and full of the Boo's that I love. Alexandria Halloween starts out in Mount Vernon, a gorgeous historical sight, and ends in Old Town Alexandria, where we get taken on a late night tour Ghost Hunters style. Rock Creek Autumn mainly focuses on a pretty creek with some lovely fall colors in the background. Didn't know Rock Creek existed before, but now it's definitely on my to do list if I ever travel to that area. Might consider contacting the Producer to see if he offers guided tours. Great disc, do yourself a favor and buy it!",1394755200,,773,4.608695652173913
8417708,5,B002ZVE0N0,"This film is an invitation into the producer's backyard, where you will see trees as far as the eye can see, in every shade of green imaginable. His cute puppy guest stars, as well as the famous Boos (at 3:45 is when you can see one of his oldest Boos hidden in the tree). Slowly, the greens start to turn to red, and the halloween Boos make their appearance. The producer also plays around with some spooky edits, showing his ghostly self walking around while his regular self is filming. Beautiful quality as usual, with a great soundtrack. 10/10, definitely recommend!",1394755200,,571,4.663366336633663
