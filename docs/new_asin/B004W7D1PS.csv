8444724,5,B004W7D1PS,"Jeff's style has continued to evolve over the years and this DVD is an excellent instructional video. What makes it so? Carswell is a very good instructor. Every passage is played slow enough for even a novice to learn the licks. Another standout is Carswell's usage and explanations of how Jeff uses the tremolo arm. While the majority of us have tremelos on our strats, it is difficult to use outside of the Hemdrix style of quick moves up or down that is largely an effect, not a note.",1366588800,2,488,4.49438202247191
8444725,5,B004W7D1PS,"Ican recommend this DVD without reservation. The instructor has obviously done his due dilligence in working out the subtleties of Beck's sound and does a great job of presenting the material. There is no lack of explaination when presenting riffs, every thing is spelled out, which is great. The only things that would be more helpfull would be discussinon about how Beck's sound is created, or even recreated for the DVD, and i would like to see more rocking tunes a la earlier Beck- but as i said i can recommend this 100%, but be aware this is PhD level stuff, not high school, so patience and humulity is needed, but ultimately if i can absord 10% of the material presented my level of playing will improve a thousand fold, and I mean, cmon its Jeff Beck!",1353715200,3,760,4.554744525547445
