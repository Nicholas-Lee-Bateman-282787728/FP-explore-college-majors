For my part, I lean more toward Tennyson's view ""nature, red in tooth and claw."" If that isn't very comforting, well who said reality should be comforting?",1325548800,,431,4.824324324324325
8049690,5,B0007OU72K,I love this book and highly recommend it to anyone who has lost someone they love or simply need reassurance that there is a loving God and heaven.  This book helped me when I lost my mother 5 months ago.  May it do the same for you.,1305331200,2,233,3.9361702127659575
