6131945,5,B00H4IR3HY,Excellent !  Watched it with my kids. Very relaxing and we all enjoyed it. Useful and positive life lessons while being funny.,1453161600,,126,4.7272727272727275
6131946,1,B00H4IR3HY,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever attempted to watch.  What a freakin' nightmare.  Making your kids watch this should be considered child abuse.  It was poorly 'written' by what appears to be a band of really boring parrots.  I can only hope the producer insisted that the 'actors' find new careers wherein they will not torture anyone further.  The dog was cute for like, a millisecond, so the one star is for him.  Save your I.Q., watch Looney Tunes instead.",1446422400,,468,4.578313253012048
6131947,1,B00H4IR3HY,"This movie was extremely disappointing.  My easily scared 8 year old chose the movie for the clever plot and the talking dog.  So if the age of this movie should be early elementary, then it was way off. I was surprised at the other reviews...not sure what ""good clean fun"" you like your kids to watch, but bullies calling someone who likes school ""dweeb, nerd, idiot"" etc is not ok in our house.  The stereotype of being smart as bad is not one that should be promoted to kids this age. The language (stupid idiot) was not appropriate given the goal of the average age for this flick. Plus the innuendos about the boss and his girlfriend ""Candy"" were totally not necessary.  As for parents sitting through it?  Wow, the acting was awful and robotic and the special effects were poorly done as well.  Even my older daughter noted that the acting was worse than what she sees in her school plays. The two thugs were the only bright spot of the movie for having more than one emotion on their face.  It gives you something to talk about as a family in terms of what the kids should have done and how he should talk to his parents about the bully.  I would not recommend this movie for anyone.",1443312000,,1190,4.377272727272727

6131950,3,B00H4IR3HY,"The bad guys are UNBELIEVABLEY STUPID !  I don't know why writers and producers think being that stupid is funny. I find it annoying! At least give characters a reason for strange behavior - Like the elderly Aunt, she was kinda funny.
  Other than the bad guys, this was a pretty good movie, but I wouldn't have watched it if I had known about STUPID characters ahead of time.",1439596800,,376,4.420289855072464

6131953,4,B00H4IR3HY,"Abner the Invisible Dog is a not-too-bad kids film that adults will be able to sit through fairly painlessly.  It follows the 'Home Alone' formula that we see in so many kids films these days.  The kid accidentally doses the family dog with a couple of secret government spy formulas that turn him into an invisible, wise-cracking pooch.  The two obligatory bumbling, clownish crooks who stole the formula in the first place now set siege to the house, trying to capture the dog instead. There's a good deal of stooge-like slapstick, butt-biting, the typical bland, pretty girl that the kid has a crush on, the typical pair of bullies that make him look like an idiot in front of her, a certain amount of fart humor, and so on.

But it gets four stars anyway because it succeeded in being entertaining and fairly funny, even with all the rehash!

If you have the kind of monkey-see-monkey-do kid who might actually try to make his own pepper spray in the kitchen after seeing it done in a movie, you might want to distract them during the kitchen chemistry scene...",1404691200,,1065,4.6436170212765955
6131954,1,B00H4IR3HY,"Gave up after five minutes.  Might be OK for very small kiddos, but not for adults or anyone over six.",1473638400,,102,4.1
6131955,5,B00H4IR3HY,"This was a great, funny, kid-friendly movie!  It was like the first, best, Home Alone.  Kids loved it!",1472947200,,102,4.611111111111111
6131956,4,B00H4IR3HY,Very good children 's movie,1472774400,,27,4.6
6131957,2,B00H4IR3HY,"I watched this with my dog a few days ago, he seemed to enjoy it but then again he enjoys licking his butt. I've never seen any of Abner's other films but I wouldn't say he's that great of an Actor. He could t even remember his lines and I'm not buying that so kid would rather go to his room to mix chemicals than eat cake (unless that little jerk is a terrorist)! I'd recommend this if you enjoy lame ass movies, if so then you should move to Loserville!",1472774400,,456,4.021978021978022

6131980,3,B00H4IR3HY,"This is a takeoff on the home alone series.  The movie has a nice plot and, considering it is sort of sifi/fantiy, it has a ""believable"" plot.  The dialog is fairly good; but the delivery by some of the adults is very amateur.  The young people deliver their lines much more realistically than the adults do.  There are a lot of twists and turns in the plot and it is entertaining.  Some of the reviewers don't seem to like some of the language and the bullying depicted; but the bullies learn not to treat their classmates incorrectly and those that use degrading language (like Laural and Hardy or The Three Stooges get their reward, too.  Except for the amateur dialog delivery, if you liked the Home Alone series, you will like this one.",1455235200,,741,4.533834586466165

8629912,5,B00H4IR3HY,we bought this movie because it had one of our favorite old time actresses(jane kean) in it. It was about a dog who drank this invisble potion and turns invisible.
