271859,2,6300248488,"If you want to see a father kiss his dead daughter's dildo, you'd better watch this series as you're unlikely to see this anywhere else.

Idea for skit.

Bob Peck: What was the nature of your relationship to my daughter?
Tim McInnerny: It was intensely physical. She used to f*** me in the ass with a dildo.
Peck: Was it a white dildo?
McInnerny: Yes. You're turning green. What's wrong?
Peck: Never kiss a dildo. You never know in whom it's been.

The only reason why I'm not giving this one star is the wonderful absence of irony. In an attempt at being a nuanced avenger, the bereaved father forgives his daughter's murderer, hugging and kissing him, in what is an almost unbearably heavy-handed scene. It's hard to satirise something that's already a parody of itself, so let's have a look at the acting. _Edge of Darkness_ suffers from the contrast between a weak leading man and a strong supporting cast. Only a strong actor could pull off the dildo scene. Bob Peck isn't up to it. It just looks weird and uncalled for. Any of the supporting actors, including Tim McInnerny, would make a better leading man.",1438214400,,1113,4.611111111111111

I found the series so engaging, that I knew that I had to own a copy of it. I purchased the program in the old VHS format as soon as that came out; but I was very happy to finally purchase a nice DVD of the show. I would highly recommend this series to anyone who is genuinely interested in British mystery programs, of which there have been many of outstanding quality, obviously.

271897,5,6300248488,"As is often the case with superior British television product, I first saw this on my local PBS station when I was in college and never forgot it. The miniseries later served as inspiration for a film starring Mel Gibson but stands head and shoulders above that effort (though Ray Winstone, who played the pivotal character Jedburgh in the film, delivers a fine performance). The cast is top notch, including the late and very much lamented Bob Peck, the wonderful Joe Don Baker as Jedburgh, and a young Joanne Whalley just before encountering fame. The plot may seem dated but it's actually not. The great struggle between capitalism and communism is over but not the ongoing encroachments of the national security state, as Snowden's revelations have made clear. I defy anyone not to be mesmerized by the scene in which Jedburgh throws the s*** at the fan.",1393027200,8,858,4.843537414965986

Absolutely compelling stuff, and 100% believable. Frightening and desperately sad, but hopeful in the power of what lengths a Father will go to for his Daughter; even though she is dead. I still treasure my (worn out) VHS dub from all those years ago.",1338768000,4,496,4.123711340206185
271944,5,6300248488,"I first watched this TV mini-series when it aired in the UK back in 1986. Back then this was a thought provoking and absolutely stunning piece of work with a superb, and haunting, soundtrack by Eric Clapton and Michael Kamen. I had looked for this before on DVD but to no avail. Finally, they released it in 2003 on Region 2 DVD in the UK and this is the version I am referring to in this review. I had it in my 'wish list' for ages before I got around to buying it. The transfer is good and the sound reproduction is faultless. The entire series has lost none of it's potency. In fact, it's actually better than I remember it. As the review on the back of the package states, This is 'A gripping eco-thriller of political conspiracies and secret service machinations' - Fantastic.  Quite why Amazon in the US has to charge $26 dollars for it here when you can buy it on region 2 DVD for 3.49 (less than $6) is beyond me. It's well worth the extra few dollars it will cost you for postage to buy it from Amazon UK (provided you have a multi-region DVD player) - But then, I have found this living in the states, It can be a lot more expensive here much of the time. If you're an avid movie collector, as I am, then it's worth investing in a machine that plays all formats. Don't misunderstand me, there are some superb bargains to be had here too, even movies that are not available in the UK (and vise versa, actually), but, for the most part, region 2 DVD (PAL, which is actually a better resolution than NTSC), is the way to go.
As for this superb made-for-tv mini-series - Edge of Darkness - Just buy it - Whatever format you choose to go with, you won't be sorry. Top marks. If I could give it ten stars, I would.",1325635200,4,1718,4.206060606060606

Slightly crazy and experiencing visits from his dead daughter, Mr. Peck is determined to find the culprits whether he lives or dies.  Great acting job by Mr. Peck.  All sorts of unsavory things are going on which takes one back to the Cold War when countries and sleezy individuals were finding ways to obtain the makings of ""the bomb"". Underground tunnels, corrupt government officials, and just plain crooks and assassins abound.

271947,1,6300248488,"Very surprised at the slow pace and bad acting in this British Drama.
The character played by Joanne Whalley was SO unrealistic (seductive like smiles while addressing Trade Union rally's for example) that I was actually PLEASED when she got blasted by gunshot in the chest. Even her over dramatic leap in the air on getting shot was over the top! Sadly, her character kept reappearing as a supposedly inspirational spirit to her father.
The story drags along too slowly with weepy scenes of reminiscence and an all-too-slow unraveling of this daughter's involvement in something deep and I found myself loosing interest well before the plot started to materialize.
I am a true admirer of British drama - but this is one to miss.

By mistake I originally started the new Mel Gibson version.  After I gave up on Mel, on the strength of the reviews, I started the BBC disks.  I persevered through the first 3 of the 6 episodes.  I won't watch the rest, especially after reading comments that the 2nd 3 episodes are less compelling that the first 3.

272002,2,6300248488,After reading the reviews on this I was expecting a fast-paced well written British spy mystery.  What I got instead is a long and drawn out overly complicated and boring story.  The acting is good but this alone does not make a show  good.  I was tempted to stop watching in the middle of the series but was hoping for a big ending that would make up for the slow start.  It was not worth the wait.  I can safely say I will never watch this again.,1274745600,7,448,4.091954022988506
272003,2,6300248488,"This BBC series from the 1980s was created at a time of deep fear about nuclear power and nuclear bombs in Britain and fashionable left-wing anti-Americanism. This was the era of the Chernobyl disaster, the women protesting against stationing long-range missiles at U.S. bases in Britain and also deep suspicion about pollution from the Sellafield reprocessing plant on the shores of the North Sea.

All these factors are reflected in this series which begins with the assassination of Emma Craven, the radical daughter of police inspector Craven right in front of his eyes. Bob Peck plays Craven, the officer who had earlier suffered the death of his wife from cancer and is now completely devastated by grief. He begins investigating the death of his daughter and finds she was a member of an environmental group which infiltrated a shadowy nuclear reprocessing plant to prove that there was illegal manufacturing of plutonium going on there.

We meet the other main characters -- the weird British operative, his even weirder sidekick and weirdest of all Darius Jedburgh, a deranged CIA spy played with over-the-top gusto by Joe Don Baker. Jedburgh isn't so much a character as a caricature of what British lefties imagine Americans to be. While his performance is enjoyable, Peck is curiously flat as Craven -- not so much a man on a mission as a shadow of a man on a shadow of a mission.

The first couple of episodes of this series are quite good but the plot gets nuttier and nuttier and harder and harder to understand. The filmmakers are anxious to deliver a statement about the threat to the planet represented by U.S. corporations and nukes -- but the statement is shrill and unconvincing.

This series stands as a document of its time -- and of a particular left-wing attitude fairly pervasive in British elites. But it hasn't worn well over the years.",1271376000,20,1864,4.870662460567823

272005,1,6300248488,"The 5 star ratings are baffling. Example of the numerous ridiculous moments in the dialogue.

He states he held his hand frequently and even kissed the hard core criminal. Then it shows the police officer in the hospital holding the hand of the guy that murdered his daughter. He has the hand pressed against his check with affection. He is trying to build up an emotional connection with the man that murdered his daughter so the murderer will reveal the name af his accomplice. At this point i removed the dvd from the machine and tossed it in the garbage. The makers of this ridiculous junk must take the viewers for complete fools and idiots. Obviously, some of them are.

Well acted by a fine groups of (mostly British) actors, it's definitely an edge-of-your seat story. And, like ""Silkwood"" -- it will make you think about the nuclear industry.

272060,4,6300248488,"This refurbished issue looks fine, since the original was shot on film. If you find you're missing occasional dialog, turn on the Closed Captions.

I watched all 6 episodes in one sitting. I was quickly struck by the masterful grip exhibited in every aspect of production. Many of the scenes were impressionistic rather than absolutely integral to the drama, but I felt like I was watching ""music."" This was true of Episodes 1 thru 4.

Episodes 5 and 6 became a different matter, a shift in tone. #5, the break-in to the radioactive waste processing plant by Peck and Baker, occurs largely in dark underground tunnels (filmed in a Welsh mine), and makes for inky visuals. Here, as in the facility itself, the two men undergo great threat and have to scramble. Finally escaping, both are victims of lethal radiation poisoning. In #6, all the male characters, all their chicaneries and complex motives, jumble up before us, so Yours Truly didn't even bother to try to figure it out. The mini-series doesn't wrap up with a happy ending, of course. I suggest a 24-hour intermission before you go into Episodes 5 and 6.

I got this DVD because of my interest in Bob Peck, who intrigued me as the android in the movie Slipstream. This fine actor died of cancer at age 53. It took me a while to recognize American actor Kenneth Nelson, of Boys in the Band fame, because he is wearing thick glasses in the role of Jerry Grogan, who seeks to acquire the processing facility. Nelson moved to England to work in a more enlightened theatrical environment, and at age 63 died of AIDS-related causes. I was galvanized by Tim McInnerny in the role of Terry Shields, the former repugnant boyfriend of Peck's murdered daughter. His projection of filthy nastiness rose from acting depths to be envied in the profession.

The 90 minutes of Supplements, split between the two disks, are exceptional, and even include Closed Captions. There's much good archival footage on this much-awarded mini-series. Magnox: Secrets of The Edge of Darkness was made for this edition and we hear from surviving participants. Director Martin Campbell is not heard from, but he liveth yet and has just directed the 2010 remake starring Mel Gibson. The Alternative Ending that's shown is much the same as the one used, with black flowers in the snow. The writer's ending in early-draft scripts called for the dying Peck to metamorphose into an old oak tree to remind us that even after nuclear cataclysm Nature will find a way and Man will go on.",1262476800,2,2508,4.771889400921659

272062,5,6300248488,"Craigmills, Yorkshire, 1985: Ronald Craven (Bob Peck) is a detective with the West Yorkshire constabulary tasked with investigating allegations of corruption and ballot rigging within the infrastructure of the local miner's union. A widower who lives with his student activist daughter, Emma (Joanne Whalley), Craven finds himself confronted with the unthinkable when a shotgun-wielding assailant confronts him on the front lawn of his remote home and Emma is apparently 'accidentally' killed in the resultant carnage. A police manhunt is launched and as the grief-stricken Craven begins to make inquiries of his own, he inadvertently finds himself involved in a conspiracy that stretches from the corridors of Westminster to the stygian depths of 'Northmoor', a remote Nuclear waste storage facility on the Yorkshire dales, and which will take him far beyond the edge of darkness and into the hinterland where big business, corrupt government and state sanctioned execution walk hand in veiled hand.

Make no bones about it, for a large swathe of the UK population, myself included, ""Edge Of Darkness"" is 'the' finest drama ever broadcast on British television and still the benchmark against which all others must be measured.

Originally broadcast in the winter of 1985 at the height of the special relationship between Reagan and Thatcher, the Labour party's most militant incarnation, renewed violence in Northern Ireland, and at a time when the British public's dissatisfaction with the Conservative government's ruthless economic policies and relentless courting of multinational business interests had resulted in wide-spread suspicion and cynicism of the establishment, the series was a smash-hit ratings winner which was repeated almost immediately, swept the BAFTA awards (British Emmys) and made a house-hold name out of the late, lamented Bob Peck.

Veteran screenwriter Troy Kennedy Martin's script, for my money, remains the most complex, nuanced, eloquent and haunting examination of a decent man caught up in the serpentine machinations of corporate power and closed government ever written. To label this series as merely a thriller alone is both erroneous and incorrect. It transcends the genre, incorporating elements of the political thriller, ghost story, vendetta movie, spy drama, western, film noir and magic realist literature, mythological fable, ecological treatise (James Lovelock's ""Gaia Hypothesis"" as set forth in his book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gaia-A-New-Look-at-Life-on-Earth/dp/0192862189/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth</a>, was clearly an influence), and all points in-between.

Performances are, frankly, stunning. Bob Peck's turn as the stoic, slowly unraveling Ronald Craven is, to this day, one the finest pieces of screen acting that I have ever seen. You will never see a finer or more subtle depiction of a man who has been eviscerated by grief. His uncomprehending, hollow, dead-eyed stare will haunt you forever and the primal scream of sorrow and frustration which he gives rise to during his second confrontation with the man who killed his daughter is still one of the most chilling moments in television history. Matching Peck pound for pound is Texan actor Joe Don Baker, whose turn as the jovial, ambiguous CIA agent, Darius Jedburgh, provides some of the most memorable moments in the series: the revisionist ""show-down and soliloquy"" which occurs when Jedburgh confronts one of the series' principal antagonists at a conference in Gleneagles, Scotland, towards the close of the story, is still discussed in reverent tones in British drama and screen-writing circles to this day. Both actors are ably supported by a brilliant cast which features a smorgasbord of British acting talent including Ian McNeice, Zoe Wanamaker, Charles Kay, John Woodvine and Jack Watson.

Apparently a big-screen remake of this series, featuring Mel Gibson, is currently in the offing. I can say, with absolutely no doubt in my mind, that it will never match the peerless brilliance and depth of the original. It is impossible to do justice to the complexity, elegance and eloquence of ""Edge Of Darkness"" in words - all I can recommend is that you rent or buy it, find a night when you are free and able to give yourself to it entirely, and truly enjoy the best of British.

And if you, like I, find yourself haunted by Eric Clapton and Michael Kamen's haunting theme tune, ""Obituary"", you can find a superbly chilling live rendition of it on the live Clapton album,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24-Nights/dp/B000002LN9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24 Nights</a>.",1255564800,5,4722,5.643661971830986

Set in Boston & not Craig Mills (not sure how that's gonna work!). Bet it's not 5 hrs long, either (I'm afraid it will lose A lot trying to trim to theatrical length). I sure am doubtful that it will stand up to our beloved original, but I reckon it has to be good news as far as finally getting A U.S.re-release of the film on DVD. -'til then, I'll keep A tight hold on my VHS copy!

If you don't know what all this means, you probably shouldn't be buying the 2003 BBC Worldwide Publishing release of EDGE OF DARKNESS. On the other hand, this 2003 BBC release is so good it alone justifies your going out to buy a multi-region, progressive scan DVD player.

If your DVD player can play Region 2 PAL DVDs, then the ONLY EDGE OF DARKNESS DVD you need is the two-disc 2003 release by BBC Worldwide Publishing. The MONO sound track is so good you can almost hear Clapton's fingertip ridges on the strings (imagine what you'd get if BBC had sprung for stereo). The visual quality of this release is also much better than I expected, a bit grainy, yes, but far far better than the visual quality of earlier VHS and DVD releases.

If you're already an EDGE OF DARKNESS fan, you're going to love this 2003 release. If you're coming to this mini-series not having seen it, you won't be disappointed. Joe Don Baker as CIA agent Darius Jedburgh is reason enough to watch the over five hours of this thriller (plus the extra features).

I first saw EOD here in the US on a syndicated basis.  They chopped it up into two parts, and cut a lot of little ""unnecessary"" bits (like Craven looking out a second storey window and seeing McCroon stepping out of the trees with a shotgun).  The sound quality was fair to poor, also.

We eventually got hold of the 2-cassette VHS copy, and caught all the things we had missed.

This is bravura work, all around.  It's a superb cast, with great writing, classic direction, a fine score.

It looks like a revenge killing gone wrong, but then questions stars appearing: if the murderer was after Craven, why did he fire both barrels into his daughter, how did he escape in the first case, why does he and all other suspects die ""resisting arrest"", and finally: why is the lock of hair Craven cuts form his dead daughter radioactive?

His need for answers takes him to a nightmarish world of governement paranoia, interdeprtemental intrigue, and secrets hidden from the public ""for their own good"".

272103,5,6300248488,"Firstly let me point out that there is a DVD version of EOD, several actually. The best version is the latest released this year which is a wonderful transfer and includes a documentary on the film, Magnox and has clips of interviews and award ceremonies and discussions on the series. It is on region 2 DVD and is available from amazon uk. I too remember watching this masterpiece unfold when it was originally screened here in the uk. I was only 14 at the time and British television was still producing some wonderful stuff. Even so I knew this was something extra special. It must have planted a seed in my subconscious. Incredibly in 2003 it has lost none of its power and seems just as prescient now as ever. The callous disregard for the individual by corporations, the 'great game' played out between competing security agencies, the conspiracy of silence in the media. The ecology movement. The collusion of government with the malign constituents in our society. Ostensibly though this is still the 'little man's story' and what a central performance from the late great Bob Peck. His personal disintegration is harrowing to behold as he tries to unravel the mystery. Joe don Baker, what can you say about his performance. He is utterly compelling as the old school agency man fighting to keep his head above water. His verbal sparing matches with 'arts council' funded MI5's Ian McNeice and Charles Kay (also superb) are very very funny. Oh the script, what a script. Troy Kennedy Martin the writer provided the most consistently brilliant screenplay for television ever written. Martin Campbell the director sculpts it all into an entity that supplants the TV media. The DVD I saw previously to EOD was Leone's masterwork Once upon a time in America and I can honestly say EOD which bares many similarities is right up there alongside it.

It is also a mythic story of hope for the future, as Bob Peck's character finds his allies in the strangest of places, even as his enemies are everywhere.

There is very little that I can add to the other reviews.  Only this:  one of the beautiful things about seeing this in series form was that you had to wait week to week to see it so that you could ponder what happened and what might happen.  Very exciting.  And, once it was over, it was a marvel to re-watch it and see how well it ""hung together.""  Especially the hushed conversations that were blown through the first time around when you were uncertain who various people were.

It is the only production that's ever compelled me to write to the network (in this case the BBC) and tell them so.
In years to come,people will forget about Bob Peck being in Jurrasic Park; they may even forget about Jurrasic Park itself, but they won't forget this movie. (...)",1006732800,4,538,4.2745098039215685
272148,5,6300248488,"Edge of Darkness, directed by Martin Campbell and written by Troy Kennedy-Martin, has the texture of a novel - the way a novel plays out in your mind as you read it.  This VHS presentation enhances that feeling, as the commercial breaks and credits of each episode are trimmed away, and the whole thing unreels in nearly six continuous hours.  Don't let the considerable investment in time frighten you.  This is some exquisite work.  To begin with, you will probably plan to watch it in ""chunks"".  Don't.  Just clear the decks, because once you start watching, you will not be able to stop until the whole thing is done.
The convoluted story does not so much develop as evolve through a series of stages.  To begin with, it is a murder mystery.  Then it becomes a political thriller.  Then a spy movie.  Next, an action piece.  Finally, it unwinds in an existential meditation on life and death.  Its politics are bit leftward-leaning, and there is a whole anti-nuke, ""environmental message"" thing ultimately worked in at the end, but the writing is skillful enough to rise above mere rhetoric and take Edge of Darkness into the realm of art.
The performances by Bob Peck, Joanne Whalley, and a host of familiar BBC faces are uniformly excellent.  Even Joe Don Baker is good as the American CIA agent Darius Jedburgh (or ""Jed-borough"", as a Scottish character calls him). As an American, I am always amused by the stereotypes other cultures have of us.  Viewed through British (or in director Martin Campbell's case, Australasian) eyes, Jedburgh becomes a roguish gunslinger in white, having apparently just stepped out of the same silver screen occupied by John Wayne and Randolph Scott. Baker is game, playing the ""cowboy"" angle to the hilt.  (He would later perform similar duty in the Campbell-directed James Bond film Goldeneye).  It is encouraging that he is ultimately a good guy, despite the ""taint"" of Reagan/Thatcher politics.
The late Bob Peck is the real standout, though.  I cannot imagine anyone else playing the role of detective Ron Craven, whose shattering personal journey gives Edge of Darkness its soul.  His performance is completely authentic as he embodies a man who has lost everything, whose only reason for going on is to bring justice to those who murdered his daughter.  We have seen this sort of thing before, of course, but rarely realized with such verisimilitude.  We sense that if such things really happened as depicted in Edge of Darkness, they would happen pretty much they way they're shown.
It's a shame that Peck was not better utilized in those big, slick, (though often hollow) films that we make in this country.  Most Americans will remember him, if they think of him at all, as the Australian hunter in Jurassic Park.  His big line, spoken just before becoming a velociraptor's lunch, was ""Clever girl!""  He managed to invest those two words with subtle shades of dread and admiration, as his character briefly contemplated the brutal speed with which his own mortality was upon him.

272149,4,6300248488,"""Get it while it's hot!""  With those words, (and two bars of plutonium in his hands) yankee actor Joe Don Baker became one of the immortals of British television in this series which set the tone for edgy, paranoiac television years before the X-Files.  In this dark mini-series, Baker played free-lance CIA operative Darius Jedberg whose cowboy swagger and country can-do attitude has guaranteed him a role in every new James Bond flick.  The real star and hero is late actor Bob Peck as Yorkshire policeman Ronny Craven whose understated yet wrenching performance of a man coming apart provides a more subtle energy than Baker's over-the top performance (see the box &#8211; the still of Peck with a gun in one hand and a teddy-bear in the other sums it up).  When Craven's radical-environmentalist daughter is brutally gunned down, Craven follows clues that lead him to suspect sinister nuclear-age industrialists.  Seeking to uncover proof of a covert program to generate weapons-grade plutonium, and thinking that Craven's daughter had been on the verge of uncovering the conspiracy when murdered, Jedburg hooks up with the british police officer who has slowly begun to disintegrate with grief.  Prodded but also steered by Thatcher-government functionaries with their own agendas, Peck and Baker form an uneasy alliance on collision course with a nuclear-age vionary.
A superb work, with a pefectly edgy score by Eric Clapton.  I first caught the series in the late 80's on PBS while Thatcher was still in office, and environmentalism was still something only radical lefties worried about.  There's a pretty heavy allegory against nuclear energy &#8211; best typified by how Craven's slow disintegration begins to mirror that of some raw and toxic isotope, radiating bits of itself away as it diminshes in halfs over a slow period of time.  But the story also excels because it rises above metaphors &#8211; the black flower that is meant to symbolize mother Earth's revenge against the human infestation that has soiled the world isn't a symbol at all, Jedberg says &#8211; he's seen it in the killing fields of Afghanistan.  Though the story is centered on Craven, the Yorkshire cop plays straightman to Jedberg's fall guy, with the two trading words about the end of the world, the environment and the lyrics to Willie Nelson songs.  I had to watch this on UHF with crummy reception (snow, doubled images and all) but you can catch it pristine.  Get this tape.",992908800,6,2471,5.044226044226044

Apart from the faces, not much has dated, and even if the threat of nuclear annihilation seems less newsworthy, it's still an excellent, taut thriller. Bleak and brilliant, it starts with a seemingly random murder, and ends with the world on the brink of apocalpyse.
Everything works, and works well - the clever, non-linear direction is never annoying, the writing is intelligent, everything progresses with brutal, cold logic, and it all seems so much more serious, more 'real' than other television dramas of the time (with the possible exception of the early 'Taggart'). The acting is superb - Joe Don Baker's character may be a stereotype, but he makes it work, and the late Bob Peck is almost disturbingly intense.
