7270656,3,B00Z710UES,There are times when I watch a movie and just have very little to say about it and this is one of them.  I can only say this for the show.  It is a good sleep aid movie.  The acting was okay when it first started out; but the movie plot and dialogue could not and did not hold my attention.  I have watched and continue to like watching kid style shows and movies; but unless I need to help in falling asleep again I do not believe that I would watch this again,1455321600,3,461,3.872340425531915

7270658,3,B00Z710UES,"Ghost Squad is a low budget likely went straight to DVD movie from 2015.  The script and special effects are of watchable quality but are nothing groundbreaking.  This is a film made for the target audience of primary school kids, following a trio of boys at the bottom of the school's social pecking order who even though they know kids their age see dressing up in costumes as something younger kids do, they don't want to give it up.  They're also still into comic books and other things Hollywood has always seen as uncool, which sure enough was back in my time when I was their age, but I'm not sure Hollywood has that correct for the real world these days, where these things are now seem to be a main part of kids popular culture. But back to the plot, they are therefore the target of another trio of boys, who are high school aged, and likely being bullied there, so need to act tough by picking on the social outcasts of their former school.  One is the older brother of the girl the main character and only one of the three whose home life we see much of, has a crush on.  However it would be hard to imagine the other two don't, but again as Hollywood school representations go, the other two have no interest in her at all. One day the bully boys are picking on the weakest of the trio, an obese child with glasses (who I think is supposed to be like Chunk from Goonies, but misses the bar in achieving that). So when the other two arrive and stand up to the bullies, with the alpha bully's sister and her condescending friend looking on, they ask what they need to do for the bullying to stop.  The bullies tell them if they spend a night in the abandoned house in town that everyone says is haunted, they'll prove they are worthy of not being bullied anymore.  Of course the bullies have already booby trapped the house and set up cameras to ensure the three geeks run away screaming.

Ghost Squad is very predictable, not helped by the fact that there's countless movies that have told the same plot before. It's a kids who get pushed around finally saying enough is enough and doing something about it type of film. Younger kids who may not have seen similar films from past decades might find the story more original and therefore more enjoyable than their parents or older kids.  As far as the horror or scare factor goes, it's very mild, around the level of an old Goosebumps TV show episode. Like the characters in the film that take up the dare to sleep in the house, most kids their age who are the target market for this film would have been watching Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Saw, Scream and every other much more hardcore horror film franchises for a long time, resulting in this film being more of a laugh than something scary.

The young actors don't do a bad job or anything, it's just the script isn't the best. You'd think they'd suspect the bullies would have some fake ghosts and stuff to scare them and looked for these things, or at the very least picked up sheets on top of furniture and stuff.  And why is there is furniture, even a piano in an abandoned house anyway?  A news report says there is a dispute over who owns the house then contradicts that sentence with the next one where it says the Council is struggling to find a purchaser for the house.  How would the Council be selling something they don't know if they own? The boys have to climb over a high fence to gain access to the property which part of has miraculously disappeared when any other character comes to the house.  There's also a whole unnecessary side story or a younger brother who calls his dad Russ but never gets in trouble for it which is pretty pointless and adds nothing but irritation to the viewing experience of the film.",1453507200,2,3760,4.399135446685879

7270687,2,B00Z710UES,"One dimensional characters, slow plot and poor script.  According to this movie every football player has a low IQ, lives to bully, and is a jerk while very nerd is nice.
