Way to go Anthony.....Seriously NO RESERVATIONS!!!!",1371513600,,266,4.680851063829787

5084233,5,B007FZ7NC6,"I'm glad I had the chance to purchase Tony's series of travel segments. I always enjoyed watching his series. I'm sad he's not doing the exact travel series, but glad his D.V.D. collection was available for purchase. Nine D.V.D.'s is a bargain. Good job Amazon.",1358208000,,261,4.822222222222222

Now I have Bourdain's snark on hand at all times :) Contains seasons 2-4 only so grab the first season separately.,1356220800,,250,4.122448979591836
5084235,5,B007FZ7NC6,"The description of this collection doesn't clearly explain what you're getting in this collection, so here it is- nine discs:

Disc 1 - Sweden, Puerto Rico, Quebec, Mexico/US Border
Disc 2 - India ( Rajasthan), India (Kolkata/Mumbai), Korea, Indonesia, Ireland
Disc 3 - Ghana, Namibia, Lebanon, Pacific Northwest
Disc 4 - Russia, Los Angeles, New York, Shanghai, Hong Kong
Disc 5 - French Polynesia, Cleveland, Brazil, Argentina
Disc 6 - Singapore, South Carolina, Berlin, Tuscany
Disc 7 - Vancouver, New Orleans, London/Edinburgh, Greek Islands, Jamaica, Hawaii
Disc 8 - New York, Laos, Tokyo, Uruguay, Colombia
Disc 9 - Spain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Washington D.C., US Southwest

Bonus features include: Promo trailers, a Behind the scenes featurette, Tony and friends: Chats with Alice Cooper, Ted Nugent, and more.

So you are getting the previously released Collections 2, 3, and 4 in new packaging. This does not include collection 1. Still, a great deal though.

A solid collection of about 42 episodes, and some bonus features, for a decent price. The packaging is a little sparse however, they did not simply re-package the old collections- the nine discs come on a single spindle cheap plastic insert inside the box. The box itself is fine, nice pictures, but they cheaped out on the plastic insert holding the discs.

So, this is a solid purchase for any No Reservations fan who hasn't purchased any of these DVD's before.

Perhaps someday Travel channel will release the entire series on Blu-Ray. Now that, I'd pay a premium for.",1338854400,95,1540,5.091269841269841
5084236,5,B007FZ7NC6,"This collection is about 33 hours long, which contains the season 2-4 from 2007-2009. Seasons 1 (2005), 5 and 6 (2010-2011) are released on a separate collection, and season 7 (2012) will be released in August 2012.

Without a doubt, this is the most entertaining food travel program blowing any other program out of competition. It includes a good balance between covering food and covering the sights of the country, but more on the food side. Each episode would roughly follow the same formula: 1- a traditional or national dish in a middle class setting, 2- eating in a budget  restaurant or home meal, 3- Eating in a gourmet upscale restaurant with a known chef. The local guides that Anthony relies on are usually very knowledgeable.

For the price of the package, you get 33 hours for only $20, that's roughly 100 minutes per $1. You can't get a better bargain than this! You can sample some episodes on other video sites then buy the collection from here. Highly recommended!",1338854400,24,983,4.770588235294118

8516053,5,B007FZ7NC6,"I've had my ups and downs with Anthony Bourdain, particularly of late. It's ironic that Bourdain often professes love for bands that never quite made it huge. It's a fan's conundrum: there's a part of you that wants the world to know how great a band is, but there's also a part of you that wants to keep things on a more intimate level, as if you are part of a secret society. It's why the term ""sell out"" is thrown around with such derision from longtime fans who can't cope with the sheeple ravenously devouring their private playthings. Even after the crowd moves on to the next shiny new object, things are never quite the same again. I feel this way about one Anthony Bourdain.

Currently hosting some rancid ABC cooking show, having left smaller Travel Channel for the grown-ups table at CNN, marrying a younger woman who'd not have the slightest interest in him prior to his stardom, and becoming an aging dad and parody of himself have all added up to a disturbing trend. Even Bourdain admits he's a sell-out, but doesn't seem to mind. He may be able to look himself in the mirror each day or laugh all the way to the bank, but I have no interest in watching his shtick anymore.

All that said, these clips reminds me of why I fell so hard for a show that spoke to me and encapsulated all that is awesome, joyous, and fascinating about this world.  The best of his work was when he connected to the locals on common ground and avoided the predictable celebrity chef schmoozing that is endemic to foodie television. Sadly, it seems like that's all he does now. These are indeed the dark days of the Bourdain Franchise. I'm waiting for him to break down and start endorsing cutlery or some kitchen ware collection on QVC.  Hey, he's now got a family to feed and for a former junkie, fame is one tough drug to kick.

That's why this collection is such a great deal. For starters, there's the Laos episode, one of my favorite episodes in the entire series because of the heartbreaking segment that opens things up, and the appearance of one of Bourdain's more famous inner conflicts. To paraphrase, by bringing beautiful places in the world to a global audience, he hastens the destruction of those places. For a travel show to be so honest about their dubious influence is the kind of candid self-awareness that makes No Reservations the best travel/food show I've ever seen. Moreover, seeing Tony humbled beyond his trademark wisecracking in the home of a man maimed by the leftover remnants of the Vietnam War is also a shovelful of humble pie for all Americans. It's brilliant television.

Beyond Laos, you've got some excellent installments such as the comical U.S. Southwest, Berlin, Cleveland, Sweden, and Quebec episodes, sojourns in Asia from Russia and India through China and Japan, as well as the notorious Namibia trip. If you're new to this show, I can think of no better overview for the price. As others have noted, this item is what had previously been marketed as collections 2-4. The exclusion of the first collection is a shame because you miss out on the fantastic Paris episode, but still, this is a pretty great bargain. Tony Bourdain gets right what so many have attempted but failed. For a guy who is admittedly snarky, he is conversely far from the Ugly American, and all Yanks abroad could learn a lot from what he does. I just wish he'd come back to earth a bit and stop being such a celebrity d-bag. The irony is huge.",1375747200,,3452,4.586709886547812
8516054,5,B007FZ7NC6,"9 DVDs for ~$20? You can't beat that! A good sampling of the show, with plenty of AB goodness. He makes me feel like a casual drinker... :-)",1373068800,,140,4.035714285714286
8516055,5,B007FZ7NC6,"I have always loved watching No Reservations. I watched this entire collection as if there were no tomorrow. Now, as I rate this collection, I am waiting on collections 1,5,6, and 7 to arrive. It is totally worth it, if you're a fan on Anthony Bourdain. Hands down... Order this and the rest of the collections.",1372723200,,311,4.571428571428571
