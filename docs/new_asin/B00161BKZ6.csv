This is a nice one to add 5-20 minutes of abs on to the end of an aerobic workout. It's broke out into 5 minute segments of classic, pilates, core, and dynamic. The only strange thing is the 1st and third one they wear shoes so you have to pick them out of order. I saw a difference right away and the more you do them the better you are at them. I'm telling you you'll like every move.",1205712000,,553,3.990990990990991
