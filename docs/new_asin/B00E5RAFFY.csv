8601613,3,B00E5RAFFY,"I really like Chris.  I liked his writing when with the magazine and follow his blog now at his publishing house.  In this video, he provides good general information on hand planes and their use.

However, watching this video really bothered me.  It is really petty and bias I know but someone should have told him that oily hair is NOT attractive on video.  It REALLY bothered me.  The same goes for his ""Coarse, Medium, and Fine"" video.  I also felt uncomfortable with his narration style as it seemed halting, unrehearsed, and a little unfocused.  I feel that I may have misspent the $50 I spent for both of these videos.

Again, I feel bad pointing this out as I have such respect for him and what he is adding to the field of woodworking.",1500595200,,744,4.451851851851852
