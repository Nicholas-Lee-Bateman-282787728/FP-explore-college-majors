8508752,5,B000X4FGZW,"This anime is the BEST romantic comedy! It is funny, charming and heart wrenching. I laughed, I even cried and I LOVED every minute of this anime. I have been looking for the DVD of this anime for so long and I am so excited to find it!
Also, on a side note, if you haven't watched the anime, don't watch the live action. Watch the anime FIRST ^.^",1303689600,,347,4.043478260869565
8508753,5,B000X4FGZW,BEST ANIME I'VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME.  I like it as much as i liked FullMetal Alchemist (even though they're complete opposites).  I don't own any of the DVDs yet but it was so good that after I saw the series I promised myself I would buy the DVD when I'm not broke.  :),1287014400,4,270,3.8727272727272726
