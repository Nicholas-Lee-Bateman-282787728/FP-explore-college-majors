8713280,5,B00WGAFIMC,"What's not to love when your kids are belly laughing and singing along.  We first saw Lorax on Netflix.  Well who thought that Netflix would drop it?  So we were looking for it and I love getting a combo pack for the blueray player in the house, the DVD for our long car rides and digital for all the other locations and devices. (Plus now I can get rid of the box!)  My 5,3,2 yr olds love this show.  The music is fresh and the diaglogue short enough that they don't lose interest.  My two year old finds a section in the ""scary"" but it is very harmless.  In the end it teaches a great lesson about taking care of the environment and what happens when one is selfish and only thinks of themselves.  Go get this for the family, especially the digital copy.  It will be with you and travels on all your devices!",1456531200,,810,4.174193548387096
