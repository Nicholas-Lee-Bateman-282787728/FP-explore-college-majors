2344573,4,B000A0D1N8,"I must have been a very goofy kid, because this is a very goofy show. Over twenty years after its original airing on Nickelodeon, I still love this show. It has a sincerity that is rare for a cartoon, but it doesnt seem sappy or over done. I recommend this to any one born in the late 70's or early 80's who spent their afternoons looking at Nick. Was there a better time to be a kid than the 80's?",1145491200,26,398,3.9875
2344574,4,B000A0D1N8,"I have always enjoyed the story of the Little Prince even though I am now an adult, the moral values and stories told in that book is true across ages.

However, I do have to say that the cartoon on these DVDs are not quite on the level of the original Little Prince. It's an excellent cartoon series for kids, just like any other cartoon series. Plus the drawing also deviates significantly from the original. I personally feel that this series should not be mentioned in association with the classic book.",1142380800,6,507,4.571428571428571
2344575,4,B000A0D1N8,"although i read somewhere that there are more episodes than 26, i might get this set. its a ""sweet and loveable"" cartoon of another version of the little prince where he goes around helping people. great stuff for kids of all generations, bla bla, highly recommend. seriously.",1126051200,,276,4.8936170212765955
2344576,5,B000A0D1N8,"I think it's so exciting to see so many classic Nickelodeon shows coming out on DVD.  First Danger Mouse, then Clarissa Explains it All, Count Duckula is coming out in October, and now The Little Prince.  My memories of The Little Prince are pretty vague (heck it's been almost 20 years) but I know I loved it.  I can't wait to purchase this set, and add it to my collection of classic cartoons to keep for not only myself, but for when I have children someday and they won't see such quality programming like this anywehre.  I hope to see more and more classic Nickelodeon shows (from its glory days in the 80's especially) come to DVD.",1125014400,5,637,4.418803418803419

8071040,5,B000A0D1N8,"Thank you for the DVD of the Adventures of The Little Prince. There were a few episodes I was interested in (What Makes Misty Mean and The Wolf Pack) mostly but I'm glad I purchase all episodes. Last time I saw this show on TV was on Nick JR during the early 90's.  When I do another DVD order check to see if you have Dinosaur King episode (Battle Royal) on it.

Thank you;

Ronald Williams",1406678400,,391,4.118421052631579
8071041,5,B000A0D1N8,"I remember the character from high school French.  I didn't know he had been used as the main character in a series of adventure cartoons.  The language is clear, all the characters are charming, there's a lot of imagination, and lovely artistry.",1379980800,,246,4.833333333333333
8071042,5,B000A0D1N8,"My review does carry a bias, lol.  This was one of the first cartoons I remember watching as a child.  Back in the days of Pinwheel(proto-Nickelodeon.)  Netflix has a reboot of this but there are, sadly, only 4 episodes available(though they did a wonderful job with it).  I really wanted to share this with my son, who is still a baby and was so happy to find this on DVD!  Being it's based upon a book, the dialog is a bit more intelligent than average cartoons for small children but with lovely visuals and fun plots.",1363046400,2,521,4.385416666666667
8071043,5,B000A0D1N8,"I remember this show quite vividly, but it's another like ""Belle and Sebastian"" that I seem to be the only one (at least in my immediate circle) who remembers it, and I remember really enjoying the cool storyline and the little Rose girl and the Little Prince with a planet just for two... ;)",1333497600,,292,4.425925925925926
8071044,5,B000A0D1N8,"I bought this to have a collection of wholesome cartoons that I grew up with around. I didn't really believe my kids would luke them but I was wrong! The only one who doesn't seem too intrested is my five year old. The 8, 11, and 13 year old enjoy watching this. I remember growing up wanting and waiting to watch the little prince!",1324857600,3,332,4.203125
8071045,4,B000A0D1N8,"I'm so used to digitally remastered dvds that the video ""scars"" are always a bit distracting at the outset of a viewing.  The stories are fun though and they quickly capture the imagination and one's full attention.",1282608000,,215,4.8108108108108105
8071046,5,B000A0D1N8,"Used to watch this cartoon when I was growing up. Great cartoon for new generation of children to see versus the stuff being cast now days. Fun cartoon and very educational for children to see as the ""Little Prince"" Travels all over the world and learns different cultures and history of each place. I bought two books and videos and both have been sent to my friends children. Good clean old school cartoon.",1243036800,7,408,4.602739726027397
8071047,4,B000A0D1N8,"I think it's great to see these shows I enjoyed as a young child available today- keep 'em coming! I'd also really love to see ""The World of David the Gnome"" (which they already put on DVD in the U.K.), ""Noozles"" (you remember, the one with the koalas?), ""Inspector Gadget"", ""Heathcliff"", etc. Thanks!!",1187740800,2,302,4.716981132075472
8071048,4,B000A0D1N8,"I had seen The Adventures of The Little Prince when I was younger and chose to relive the good years by buying this. I was aware that it was older when it comes to animation, but I decided it was worth buying. I do love watching this once in a while because it has good messages and a cute story to it. If you've ever seen these adventures, I would advise buying them for little children.",1167868800,9,388,4.118421052631579
