8073276,2,B000A2XD48,I'm a big movie buff.. especially ghost stuff I love ghost hunters and paranormal stuff but to be specific here with this set of Ghost Killers just didn't do it for me. Sorry.. these were kindo of 'acting' type roles and just not the same as the paranormal stuff I'm into.,1215043200,3,272,4.352941176470588
8073277,4,B000A2XD48,"This DVD contains two classic horror films (including NIGHTMARE CASTLE with the uncomparable BARBARA STEELE!) and one newer release that doesn't seem to be available anywhwere else.  The classics have been reviewed to death (no pun intended) so I see no need to review them.  THE SPIRIT HUNTER, on the other hand, is definitely worth a watch.  The story revolves around a man who cannot remember his past.  The twist is that he is dead, and unlocking the secrets is the key to achieving heaven or eternal damnation.

The cover to the DVD is really cool -- it is a 2x3 lenticular, similar to the 1x1 toys you used to pull out of Cracker Jacks boxes that the image would change on when you moved it.  In this case a beautifully rendered image of BARBARA STEELE turns to a skeletal ghost and the candles blow out.  On top of this, I just found out that this cover (whose artist is CHRISTINA YODER) has been nominated for the coveted CHESLEY AWARD -- the top honor an artist of science-fiction, fantasy or horror can receive.

I recommend this DVD both for the exclusive film and for the cool cover.  VINTAGE HOME ENTERTAINMENT has outdone themselves with this design. The lenticular effect and the work of this artist was also featured on nine other of Vintage's horror releases.",1147132800,9,1276,4.635555555555555
