7823740,3,6302221595,"Jack Scalia plays an ex-L.A. cop who left the Force under unhappy circumstances and who now works for a home-security service in San Diego. During the course of his job he meets Kathryn Harrold who's temptingly beautiful and who's unhappily married to millionaire Will Patton. Scalia and Harrold are soon involved in a passionate affair and it isn't long before Harrold begins to hint that life would be so much better if her husband were no longer around. You've seen this plot before and while it's done with made-for-TV competence it never quite seems plausible because the Scalia-Harrold romance doesn't seem ""hot"" enough to blind Scalia to Harrold's manipulative behavior. Jack Scalia, who got his start modeling briefs, has never quite risen above ""male bimbo"" status in his acting career. He's suitably attractive in this outing, even at age 39, and no opportunity is lost to exploit his well-toned body by getting him out of his clothes. He appears in no less than five ""beefcake"" scenes with frequent views of his bare chest and in one of these scenes you also get a dimly-lit view of his bare buttocks. As for his chest, while Scalia has sometimes appeared with it shaved for that ""boyish"" look, here he sports a patch of black hair on his sternum.",1117238400,4,1258,4.828703703703703
