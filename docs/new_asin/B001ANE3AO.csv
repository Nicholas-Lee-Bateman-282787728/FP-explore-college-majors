3454952,5,B001ANE3AO,"The film is outstanding; one of the best films I have seen in my life.  It is an excellent update of Dante's magnificant medieval poem, ""The Divine Comedy.""  I originally saw the film at the San Francisco Film Festival and really had to own it.  The concept of using paper puppets is an intriguing twist.  I recommend the work to all.",1229904000,4,334,4.426229508196721
3454953,4,B001ANE3AO,"This isn't really the Inferno Dante wrote. Instead, it's a black comedy with a contemporary spin and more than a little of a liberal bent. Those looking for a rich interpretation of Dante had better stay home, because you won't find it here.

But it's a truly fun ride, largely because of the success of its whimsical animation style. This is a visually spectacular film, and the care with which it has been produced is evidenced on every frame of film. Beautiful work, and with enough jokes for Dante lovers to keep them entertained. Highly recommended.",1226361600,4,554,4.770833333333333
3454954,2,B001ANE3AO,Would've been nice if there were no political references and instead to of shown a neutral stance. The book itself is a great read and I suggest that the book is read before watching the biased movie. Overall it is an ok theatrical attempt but I still believe that a better reenactment of the great novel could be made.,1220054400,3,319,4.423728813559322
3454955,4,B001ANE3AO,"Likewise, I also saw this on OVATN.  Despite this film being composed mainly of 2-D cardboard pieces (with the exception of God and Lucifer), the low budget doesn't stop this film from being entertaining.  Theme and message aside, this film gives plenty of laughs for those who can appreciate it's various forms of humor (from political, historical, to some slapstick).  Hilarious to see some famous political figures in certain levels of hell, especially Fox News somewhere in the 7th or 8th (can't remember exactly, but somewhere around there), thus making a statement at how fake and/or biased the news is when it comes to stories, implying that they tell half truths or blow a story out of proportions making them whole lies.  That's just a tip at the iceberg when it comes to the parodies this remake of a classic story makes upon the modern world.  If you can withstand the cardboard pieces, you'll be in for an interesting form of entertainment.",1214179200,10,952,4.851851851851852
3454956,4,B001ANE3AO,"Ovation TV is showing this film in their animation week. Thank you, Ovation.
As Virgil says, ""I don't like puppets.""  But I will make an exception for this work of art. The technique is similar to the Shadow Puppetry of SE Asia. At one point, Ulysses introduces a movie of what he did after Troy. The ""movie"" uses the traditional shadow puppets to show Bush's fantasy of bringing democracy to the Middle East. The entire movie is clever in its use of the puppetry.
This is the ultimate message movie with heavy-handed commentary. But hey, it's Dante's tour of Hell, no subtlety needed. I have only read summaries of the original story so cannot tell you how close it is to Dante's version. Beatrice makes a token appearance. But the people shown range from Lizzie Borden to the man who set up the Jews to be blamed for the crucifying of Christ. There's even a surprise guest from the Bush Administration. Fox News provides some transportation.
Gay men are shown being forced to dance to techno music. Someone is condemned for downloading Metallica. Several Popes show up, including John Paul II. Somehow you will be offended by this movie. Get over it.
I am looking forward to owning my own copy so that I can pause the film and read the signs on the scenery.",1213833600,16,1259,4.595555555555555

3454959,2,B001ANE3AO,"I watched this as a supplement to reading Dante's Divine Comedy, as a review said it was an accurate portrayal of ""Inferno."" I would have been better off not watching this at all. It's extremely loosely based (I guess there are looser interpretations out there) so please don't watch this if you need it for study purposes. Outside of using it as fodder for study it's, eh, alright. It's amusing, James Cromwell is Virgil, and it's all done in paper puppets (minus Lucifer).
Please, please don't take anything away from this as being anything like Dante's epic, Inferno. Yes there are clearly parallels they stuck to, but looking at a chart of the levels of Dante's hell would give you better insight into the book/poem than this would. They tried to modernize it too much, and it ends up falling flat. I would never watch this for enjoyment. Maybe if you live in Colorado, and got REALLY, REALLY high, this movie would be interesting.

Another reviewer said it correctly: ""Dante for Dummies."" Indeed. They try so hard to be funny, modern, and relatable to the (below) average audience that it kills all the interest of the original story for the audience that is actually well versed with the original (who this movie also tries, and fails to pander to).
Yet another reviewer said this was like if Matt Stone and Trey Parker of South Park did Dante's Infero. False. If Stone and Parker actually attempted an Inferno episode it would be educational, correct, and amusing for both the read and unread alike.

I'm sincerely sorry I ever watched this.",1417910400,,1548,4.75092936802974
3454960,4,B001ANE3AO,"A solid adaption of a classic work, this movie manages to capture the original's tone by changing rather than staying faithful. The circles of hell are all there and mostly the same but the surrounding and characters have all been modernized into recognizable stereotypes or reference. Rather than being a lame attempt to modernize, these changes actually reflect the way Dante had intended his contemporary audience to see the poem, and make for a version of the Divine Comedy that everyone can find funny, without combing through pages of footnotes to the reference. It's not perfect, but its flaws are small and forgivable.
The most polarizing part of this adaption is the visual ""puppet show"" style. It takes a lot of getting used to, and, while I'm still not a huge fan of it, I've come to enjoy it for the unique visual opportunities it allows.
If you're a high school kid looking to find a movie version so you don't have to read the book, first off shame on you, but secondly this is the one you want to watch before you read the poem. The modernization makes the messages much clearer and will help you significantly in understanding the original poem which yes you will still have to read after watching.
As for those of you who are fans of Dante's divine work, this is an interesting interpretation and definitely worth the time to watch. Give it a rental, since Netflix dropped it for no good reason.",1416441600,2,1412,4.674698795180723
3454961,4,B001ANE3AO,"The film begins with a scrolling text about this 700 year old story and its author. Next there is a audience sitting down to watch a play, all the people, the stage actors, and musicians are cutout puppets. The play is Dante's Inferno, after several different curtains, a metal garage door opens, behind it there is a modern city with graffiti on its building's walls, and trash on the side of the street. A man wakes up on the street and then narrates about how he doesn't know how he got there. The puppet wires at times can be seen, which is part of the show. There are also background puppets, such as cars, birds, and helicopters in various scenes. For those unfamiliar with the poem there are signs throughout the film, which say 'Canton' and then the number of that part of the story they are at, which matches the canton of the poem.

He meets a guy in ancient Greek man dressed in robes named Virgil the poet/writer, who offers to be his guide. Virgil then tells the man, named Dante, that his dead girlfriend asked him to help out her former boyfriend.

In between scenes the curtain comes down, and another location set is seen when it raises. They enter a subway type sewer tunnel with warning signs about what they will find, but he follows the old man. They come out near the docks and find protestors, endlessly protesting nothing. They meet a police officer named Charon, in charge of people getting on the ferry ship to go to a place called Hell, in the after life. There is a Earthquake and then he wakes up in Limbo, where they meet other Greek writers. They then go the court of Judge Minos. From there they go to the lust section of town, with various animated representations of sex. Where he meets a woman and man that tell their story and how they got there.

Dante faints and wakes up in a new section of town, where he is nearly killed by a dog with three heads. There he meets a fat guy in 'Gluttony' area. Then in the 'Greed' area there are people are pushing cars around in circles. They reach the river Styx, and hire a motorized boat to take them to the other side. Along the way they encounter the angry people, swimming in hate. One of the people get their skin ripped off, so that they are only muscle and nerves. {This image is also the cover of the DVD release}.

They arrive at he 'City of Dis' a planned community. They end up at the spa where people are boiling in their own heresies, from work related, to religious, and political tubs.

They next stop at a lookout site, and while looking through a telescopic viewer, Dante sees illustrated drawings of people's mug shots, and the violent things they did. First they see people who committed fraud, then those who cheated, and lied. Lastly the people accused of treachery. They stop at the Minotaur food stand, and then meet two police, these are part men, and  part horse. Dante and Virgil get a ride from them to the River of Blood. The four people in the river are finger puppets, the hand performing the puppets raises up, shows the visitors the middle finger then a wrench comes down and rips that puppet's head off the finger.

They next enter a forest, and talk to a bendable tree that tells them his story. Next they stop by a night club where the gay people are forever dancing, they dance by air being blown from under the puppets. They pass from the city to the rock valley of 'Fraud' where they encounter a helicopter called Greyon/Fox News. An interviewer then tries to ask them incriminating questions and Virgil just tells Dante to keep moving. Dante doesn't want to get out of the chopper so he is kicked out. As he lands, he bounces up and down in an accordion style as he straightens up. Once in the streets of Fraud they meet the dealers in food, and their boss a woman named Celia who drives a long convertible Cadillac. Dante and Virgil get a ride from her. They arrive at the Capital Building, and then the statue on top begins to sing a jazz style song called ""We are the Lobbyists"", while members of Congress join in. The song ends with the members of congress in prison suits, and behind bars, in front of the capital building.

Dante then tells the driver to stop, hardly believing it when he sees a church, which is where people that are buried upside upside down, and up to their waists, have with their feet on fire. Among them is a pope that tells the story of various other unscrupulous popes. They next pass by a 'Psychic' shop, where people have their heads on backward, as having always wanted to see into the future, and now had to see only what they had just passed.

They arrive at a airport, and where Celia leaves them. They see a senator get stopped by security which find bribes on him. Then the security men beat up a former vice president for accepting bribes. Dante and Virgil try to make a run for it, but miss the jet, then get out from behind the puppet stage, and cut the cord to lower the curtain. It later raises in the middle of a parade of Hypocrites in silly costumes.

Next they come to a place where all the people look just like Dante and Virgil, these are the clones, and identity thieves. Then there is mess load of Popes in small scooters. They next stop at a puppet theater, they decide to go in, even though Virgil hates puppets. The show is 'Ulysses: The Untold Story', a shadow puppet theater. In this retelling of the events after the Trojan War, Ulysses goes off and tries to spread his views in other countries, by liberating their loot, and the ship sinks with all the treasure and his men.

After the puppet show they try to get a taxi, but the driver starts yelling at Dante about how the U.S. hates Muslims, and how Christians caused strife and skizums in the world at one time also. They decide to walk to the Malebolga Business Center. Here Dante has to try figure out who the people are and what they did, in a game show type style {mentioned in the audio commentary as Paul Zaloom's idea}. Dante only gets the last of the questions correct, then the elevator goes black, and they suddenly appear in a subway car. They continue onward to the frozen Lake Cocytus, where they ice skate, {with magnets under the lake set, according to the commentary}. Then there are found to be people frozen in the ice, and they are betrayers, one of which is chewing on another persons ear. They then meet the live action Devil, {played by head puppeteer Paul Zaloom} in red makeup, painting his fingernails black. He then eats a few paper people, while watching TV. He spots them, and they escape by going behind him, and then down the crack of his rear end.

They travel through the darkness and Dante alone climbs a hill which overlooks the city of Los Angles where he was before he had become lost. Dante reflects on his journey and hopes he can do the right thing, and then calls his friends to tell them what has happened to him. The curtains then come down, as the early credits start. After the main producers of the film are displayed, a person {Paul Lohr} walks in front of the theater puppet stage, while carrying a ladder, thus showing how small the audience puppets and stage were, and the film then fades to black. As the cast and crew credits roll, the song ""I'll fallow you down' plays. After the credits the stage curtains open one last time to show paper representations of 25 of the cast, crew and a dog, then the film fades to black one last time.

The film is based on a earlier adoption of the Dante's story, Marcus Sanders with illustrations by by Sandow Birk but in that translation, they did all three parts of the story. While this film focuses only on the first story. The makers of this film previously, made an earlier film called ""In Smog and Thunder"" which was similar to this, as it had various paintings that were taken and moved from time to time, but mainly that film dealt with still images. In this film they opened up their possibilities, by adding more movement to the images by representing each person as a paper puppet. This is a style of puppetry that Paul does in many of his FRUITofZALOOM YouTube videos. The game show section near the end seems very remonstrant of Paul's work in 'Beakman's World'. His co-star from that show Mark Ritts is also said to be in this film, playing a guy who kills his cheating wife and her lover, but he is not listed on the DVD credits. He is listed on the Internet Movie Database listing for the film, even though he he has very few lines. Another connection to Beakman's World is that the puppet of Virgil doesn't like puppets, and in the television series the penguin puppets Don and Herb are jealous of another bird Scratchy, until they realize he's just a puppet. A penguin puppet also walks alone through the ice scenes, but always alone, as if looking for another penguin. I imagine him saying ""Don, where are you, and why did you give that big red guy our TV and remote."" Lastly Paul as Beakman also takes off his shirt during Beakman's World Season 1 episode 19, where he has nothing on but a cloth like diaper, then he lays on a bed of nails. Which shows his chest is always hairy like that.

The film if rated would probably be rated 'R' because of the language, and sexual depictions. While in some countries it might get a lower rating, others might restrict it to adults only. There is also suggested violence with a knife dripping blood, and squirting blood splattering on a figures face, with a water pistol from off screen.

The DVD comes with two mp3 soundtrack songs. In a folder named MP3. There is also a index HTML file, that if opened takes you to a screen were you can download the mp3 files, which are stored on the DVD, this is an alternate way, to just 'opening' and viewing the files on the disk.
1. Follow You Down, by Mark McAdam. {A country music song with banjo, and harmonica.}
2. The Lobbyists, by Martha Pimpton, and Mark McAdam. {A jazz style song with piano and saxophone, listed in the movies credits as ""We are the Lobbyists"".}

The other bonus features of the film are;
* A Making of Featurette, ""12 Days in the Underground: Filming the Inferno"", 15 minutes and 25 seconds.
The documentary starts with the opening scene of the film and the raising of the curtains and the first puppet sitting up, and then Paul explains what he wants, and how they wanted to change the story to be more modern. It then cuts to him getting his devil makeup applied. From there it cuts to Sandow Birk discussing how the film came about. Behind the scenes footage of the talking to trees scene, and then Sean Meredith talks about the difficulties of making the film. There is then behind the scenes footage of the ice skating scene. It then returns to Paul, and the footage of the musical scene at the Capital Building. Sean Meredith then talks about the effects, and there are scenes from the observation lookout telescope. Paul then tells about the hard work and enjoyment of making the film. Sandow Birk and Elyse Pignolet talk about how they made so many different puppets of the same character, and in different sizes. Paul then explains the reason for the different sizes. Michael Negrin, the director of Photography then tells about filming the scenes, the camera angles and lenses. Sean Meredith then talks about how long some shots take to get correct. There is then more behind the scenes footage, this time from the spa set. Sandow Birk and Elyse Pignolet then talk about how it all became realized when others added their parts to making the film work.

3454963,5,B001ANE3AO,"I love the original Inferno and nothing will replace it.
That said, this brilliantly bizarre updating gives back to the Inferno the immediacy it had for its first audience.
Characters we recognize, sins we grapple with, political swipes we understand--no hunting through your footnotes here. Like all good adaptations, it should send you back to the original with fresh curiosity and motivation.
But for pity's sake, does no one at Amazon look at the content they put in their ""kid and family movie"" category?

3454967,5,B001ANE3AO,"At first glance one would consider this movie to be a joke, but it's actually quite brilliant.
It reminded me so much of the tale of Ebenezer Scrooge; perhaps inspired by Dante's Inferno.
The moral is to be careful because even if you think you are being good, you may actually be sinning.
In a nut shell, if you are a Christian, it is probably best to repent your sins with true meaning before they doom you to Hell.
Finally, never, never, never try to think you are God by trying to outwit him or using his name to gain power, deceive, or betray another person or persons.  The deepest level of Hell is reserved for betrayers.  :-(",1379635200,2,633,4.3559322033898304

3454969,5,B001ANE3AO,"Ricochet B001ANE3AO

If someone came up to me, a few years back, and said I would be laughing out loud at a ""toy matine"" version of Dante's Inferno, I'd say they didn't really know me. Well, apparently, I didn't know myself. This production is quite the noble effort.

The heart and soul shines through in the production quality, the writing, the humor, the whole message. And when I found out Paul Zaloom, of Beakman's World, was involved, I said, ""Well, of course it's good!""

If you've read the original Dante's Inferno, you'll get a lot of the humor. If you're over sensitive or rabid in your politics or religion, you probably won't find much of this very amusing. It gives a playful poke at almost every political view and religious belief you can think of ( The production even pokes fun at itself ) while the underlying message of the good ol' Golden Rule is loud and clear.

At first the toy matine format catches you off guard. But as the story gets going you forget about that and enjoy the show.

The Ricochet DVD is very good quality. No artifacts or pixelation. Sound is crisp. Colors are bright. Detail is sometimes too good and reminds you ""Oh, yeah. I'm still watching a puppet show.""). My advice, pick this up.",1373587200,,1228,4.5636363636363635

3454973,1,B001ANE3AO,"I wish I could say I liked this film. I have liked Dermot Mulroney for a long time but this made me question why. The movie isn't subtle. In fact, you may watch the curtain fall and find you feel as if someone has been pelting you with bricks for the past hour. But I don't think that is the largest of its shortcomings. I'm a fairly liberal person and agreed, to an extent, with some of the pretty obvious points he was making, but what I wanted to see-- and what I think any piece of work wanting to incorporate Dante's name demands--was the aspect of humanity that necessitates a hell. I understand that this is supposed to be satirical in nature but this kind of finger- pointing ridicule is better suited for King of the Hill jokes than the pretense of a Dante parallel. Chances are you're going to attract the attention of a reasonably intelligent audience who quite possibly is already of the inclination that Fox News does tend to expend some effort into getting people worked up and an audience that's thoughtful enough to wonder what transgressions you're committing while fervently pointing your finger at all these other people. I guess I'm just saying, if you're gonna take something smart, use it in a smart way. In this movie, everyone was dumb, especially the puppet paraded as Dante, and if anything was accomplished here, I'm going to have to assume it was a general feeling of ""aren't I clever?"" the creators may have felt while making it, however misplaced a feeling it was.",1325635200,,1494,4.599250936329588

Right here, twirling a feather at your nose and tickling so hard that you feel the need to speak to a priest. This version of Dante's Inferno is nothing short of divine: the scenery, the characters, the portrayal of Hell... everything almost makes you forget previously reading Dante's illustrious epic poem if indeed you ever did. And if not, this is a great way to be introduced to the titan of classical epics. Despite the use of cardboard cut-outs as puppets, Dante's Inferno colours the realm so brightly that in many cases, I have seen folk read the poem based on their enjoyment of the film. And that says a few somethings to me.

The visuals are wasted upon any HDTV, but larger screens make the elaborate designs fuller and easier to make out the subtleties, and there are plenty. Ditto with the sound design. You aren't watching this for the HD experience. Not at all.

There are a few bonus features, most noteworthy being the commentary tracks, both of which are enjoyable; the second of the tracks, the recorded opinions of a renowned scholar makes quite a few poignant statements that will make most people begin to wonder.

Like most works of years gone by, everyone who is anyone in literature or criticism will cite various 'true meanings' of the 'literary intent' of the work. Shut off that part of your brain, please. Grab some popcorn. Invite some friends over and have a gas.

Not only is the production true to classic puppet theatre techniques, but it's great fun to see who's ended up where, and why. The musical number is a hoot! The special feature on the behind-the-scenes production gives a good background on the history and techniques of puppet theatre, and interviews explain some of the thought processes behind choosing who's in Hell, where they ended up, and why, and some of those choices could be viewed as controversial. More great information is provided in the commentary, and you get two choices of commentators, each focusing on different aspects of the production. Overall, a very classy and well-done film!",1267574400,2,797,5.234375
3454981,4,B001ANE3AO,"This was actually very good for someone who knows and loves the original, because then you get all the references. Good sense of humor. Very left-leaning in whom it assigns to hell (Bushies figure prominently, as do Christians). But at the same time - look at how it handles some embarrassing parts of Dante from a modern perspective. It doesn't remove or skip homosexuals, but it has them there mostly for what seems to be hypocrisy (most of the men listed were closeted and guilty of quite other bad behavior - e.g. Ernst Rohm), and their punishment seems to only be to dance to bad music - FOREVER! (Again, the movie has a naughty but not vicious or cruel sense of humor.) I would think for someone who's never read the original, the experience would be more ""huh?""",1250121600,2,768,4.572463768115942
3454982,3,B001ANE3AO,"Dante Alighieri's `Divine Comedy' is filled with vivid imagery and flowing poetry.  It is one of the most celebrated pieces of literature of all time.  It doesn't need many more translations.  New ones are welcome, but it has been improved upon for the English reader time and time again.  On the other hand, `Dante's ""Inferno,""' the movie, takes many modern contexts and puts a new spin on the timeless classic.

Based on Marcus Doug Harvey, Sandow Birk, and Marcus Sanders' adaptation, the film is a cut-out puppet show--one with the wires still very visible attached to figures going across a mini stage with the finesse of amateurs using magnets and paper clips.  The sets are a landscape of (mostly) urban decay--still lifes that are at best a bit impressive, but that`s the exception not the rule.  The composite may seem like an A+ project by a high school senior, but on DVD, the results may be of interest only to hard-core Dante-philes or the uninitiated who only want to take the journey via 'Cliff Notes'.

Sight gags and funny references go along with literal passages, and true characters from the book go along with modern updates.  (You get to meet Palo and Francesca, Ciacco, the Hog; and Brunetto Latini--as modern players, except their characters and sins are remarkably intact.  However, this time you also get to meet Richard Nixon, Hitler, and Stalin along the way.)

The best aspect of the movie is the written material, which is mostly funny and favorable.  Sometimes the modern update is right on the money.  (Who can argue with Lizzie Borden being among the traitors against kin in the last circle of hell, Lake Coccyx?) Still, finding Hitler among the fortune-tellers doesn't exactly sound like poetic justice to me--even if their explanation does make a point.  And, for that matter, I wouldn't put Cardinal John O'Conner in 'The Inferno' at all, but that's just me.  I happened to notice that there were a lot more Republicans than Democrats in 'The Inferno,' but, 'The Divine Comedy' does have its political references.  Instead of Ghelfs and Gibolenes (white and black), we get red and blue.

Anyway, I'm not God and Dante never pretended to be--it was all meant to be representations of sin and redemption with identifiable figures from Dante's neighborhood to fictitious people in Greek mythology.

`Dante's ""Inferno""' entices as much as it repels.  To keep a wider audience, the entertainment goes into full gear.  ""Every dog has his day,"" Dante quips after Virgil shoots the three-headed dog, Cerebus.  At 1:18 the presentation does an admirable cross-section of some of the most memorable cantos.  It is rated R for the language and for the explicit nudity during the first circle of the lustful.  (I never thought paper puppets could leave so little to the imagination.)

Dermot Mulroney does a convincing modern everyman as Dante, the pilgrim, and James Cromwell is perfect for the voice of Virgil.  Clocking in at such a short time, I'll bet a lot of college students and Dante aficionados will satisfy their curiosity for a thoughtful, but often bare bones presentation of a marvelous work.

(Those who are strict with literature interpretations of 'The Divine Comedy' should take consolation that at least this interpretation is closer to 'The Inferno' than the film '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-Dreams-May-Come/dp/B00007GZR5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What Dreams May Come</a>'.)",1244851200,4,3468,5.1813285457809695

8278102,1,B001ANE3AO,"Despite its very cool concept and art, this movie has only a basic structural connection to Dante's Inferno. It can't be read as giving an idea of the intent or content of the classic poem. For example, Francesca and Paolo are in hell for a brief kiss, a brush of the lips, which counts as unfaithfulness to her marriage. Dante swoons from sadness at their fate for misguided love. In this movie, they are grotesquely portrayed and she is murdered by her husband. This is certainly not in Dante - and shows the films underlying misogyny that is clearly directed at young men? The characters in hell and Dante himself, in the original poem, show that even ""nice"" or sympathetic characters are in hell. Here, you will find a caricature of Dante's (already) exaggerated ideas of hell. The point of Dante's poem is that even sins culture finds ""justified"" are not so.  I wish the creators of the film would have taken the actual story and intent more seriously and used their impressive creativity to actually give an update.",1484092800,,1021,4.70391061452514
