8497376,5,B006G2FTE8,"I am quite pleased with this DVD, which complements the book: `Maskim Hul' by Michael W. Ford, very nicely!  Michael W. Ford is my favorite author of the Occult. This DVD: `Babylonian Magick and Luciferianism' is most helpful to me as I read the book: `Maskim Hul'. I am an alumnus of the University of California at Berkeley and so I am used to world-class professors. For me, Michael W. Ford exemplifies this as the best `Professor of the Occult'. Mr. Ford has a good `stage-presence' on camera, as I have previously noted in his many YouTube videos of which I am rather fond. I find this DVD most useful for several reasons. First, it is like being able to spend some time with Mr. Ford personally. Secondly, it is helpful to view this while trying to figure out the pronunciation many of the names and words found within the book: `Maskim Hul'. Lastly, Mr. Ford does use some helpful props and visual aids in his `Lecture' / explanation, which I enjoyed. He also shares a few things on the DVD which are not found elsewhere. I have already viewed this DVD many times over and will continue to do so into the future, until I am able to virtually recite this information. I recommend this DVD with great confidence to other serious students of the occult.",1341187200,2,1257,4.537444933920705
