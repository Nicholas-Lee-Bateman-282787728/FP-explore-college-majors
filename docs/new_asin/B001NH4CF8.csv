3718787,5,B001NH4CF8,"i bought this DVD series for my daughter who is 15 years old.  she loves watching the show on TV. She only discovered this show within the last few months on TV and as a result has missed a few seasons, that is why i bought it for her so she could ""catch up"" on the other shows that she missed during the beginning of the series.  Not to mention, the price was really good for these DVD's on Amazon.  Thanks so much Amazon, we have been looking for this Series on DVD for sometime and you're the only ones that we found carried it.",1242950400,3,531,4.038095238095238

8326999,5,B001NH4CF8,This show used to air on The N channel ten years ago! Man I'm feeling old - Samantha Best is a foster kid who wins a scholarship to a Ivy league school and has a series of tragic events unfold in rapid succession. It was one of the better teen/college based shows on the air. Season 2 was delayed by 8 months but lost most of the 1st seasons cast. It's a great show.,1485043200,,366,3.9594594594594597
8327000,5,B001NH4CF8,Great series I highly recommend it,1447977600,,34,4.833333333333333
8327001,5,B001NH4CF8,I loved the series when it was on. Only watched the first series when it was on tv cause they didn't advertise the second series. Overall it was a good series and i would recommend it.,1400457600,,184,4.138888888888889
8327002,5,B001NH4CF8,"Still one of my favorite shows of all time. Sad to see it go, but the 2nd season isn't quite as disappointing as everyone says. I enjoyed it even though some of the main characters were gone. My DVD player actually ruined one of the episodes because I watched it so many times, so watch out if you're playing one episode more than once because it freezes when I try to watch it (although, I'm probably the only one that does that).",1399248000,,431,4.2682926829268295
8327003,5,B001NH4CF8,This has got to be one of the Best The~N shows EVER produced! Season 2 was a disappointing follow-up so stick with season 1. The cast and plots are perfect :),1398124800,,158,4.129032258064516
8327004,5,B001NH4CF8,"This is the best show I still can't believe they canceled it, the show has everything packed in one show",1392422400,,104,4.25
8327005,5,B001NH4CF8,Definitely one of my favorite shows that was on television when I was in high school. I am really glad that it was available for purchase through Amazon! The package did have a different language on the cover which initially scared me but everything was in English and it came just as I expected it to.,1363219200,,302,4.410714285714286
8327006,5,B001NH4CF8,The first season is definitely the best. It's well worth the price and it's a shame that it only had two seasons.,1361404800,,113,4.181818181818182
8327007,5,B001NH4CF8,"The most addictive show I have ever watched!  It is full of fun and a great cast, it's unbelievable that the N cut it short and changed everything and everybody for season 2 and ruined the show!  Season One is a winner!",1289520000,8,219,4.190476190476191
8327008,5,B001NH4CF8,My order arrived a day early in wonderful condition and played as it should have in my DVD player. The packaging was great and I would definitely by from this seller again.,1283126400,,172,4.40625
