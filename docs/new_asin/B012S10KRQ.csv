The film is well-acted, super entertaining, and has a couple scenes that are downright beautiful.

My only complaint was that I kinda saw the ending coming, but that's just a minor complaint.

If you're a horror fan, you're definitely gonna want to see this.",1443916800,2,329,4.7368421052631575
7358318,2,B012S10KRQ,"I really wanted to like this film, and while I didn't hate it, I think I said, WTF?!? at least 20 times.

If I hadnt rented it and was watching it for a 31 Horror Movies in October challenge, there is a good chance I would have turned it off, due to the really bad sound in some places, especially at the beginning. When they were crunching through the snow and talking, I couldn't even understand what they were saying. I had the TVs sound up really high so I could usually hear them, but then was continually turning it down.

Then there was the editing in spots. There were more spots then this, but I'm trying to keep this review short. Two of the women are down by the lake, and Mark is coming down the stairs, then hes just instantly by their side.
Emma all of a sudden freaks out for no reason (she doesnt yet know theres a killer on the loose). Shes staring at us, slowly backing up to the wall. But there is nothing/no one there. Then she wakes up and is laying on the floor right next to the fire place with her head on rock. (Was she drugged and I didn't notice?)

The step-dad at the beginning looks to be around the same age as the kids. And the way he was putting the presents under the tree shoving them under with the ribbon on the bottom. Petty of me, perhaps, but it was done in such a way that it really stood out.
And some of the shots were played out way too long, like when the step-dad was decorating with the tinsel on the counter. And when they are tromping up the stairs, instead of focusing on the feet forever, at least give us a butt shot!

Some of the actors did a pretty good job, like Mark and Katie. And Justin reminded me looks wise, of a cross between Jensen Ackles and Matthew Lillard, so that was nice. Plus the naked butt shot was appreciated.
But where where the boobs?? It's a slasher film! When Katie was in the bathroom getting ready to take a bath, this would have been a perfect opportunity.

If I were to watch this again, it would be as a drinking game with a group of friends. We would drink every time one of us said, WTF?!?; because we couldn't hear what they were saying, the story line stumbled due to editing, or some rando shows up even though they are supposed to be in the middle of nowhere, and it is way too cold to just be wandering around the woods in Wisconsin.",1443916800,2,2321,4.160356347438753
7358319,3,B012S10KRQ,"Pretty average Slasher flick. Really liked the killer's mask. Liked the setting, it has some nice camera work and a decent body count. Just wished the murders had been bloodier and NOT telegraphed. My biggest complaint: except for one short haired gal, it was pretty hard to tell who was who as the ladies in this have a very similar look (long haired brunettes).

I realize this is very low budget, but some bloodier deaths would've earned this 4 stars.",1443916800,,454,4.675
7358320,4,B012S10KRQ,"My love of holiday themed horror is well known. I also happen to be a big fan of the work that Kevin Sommerfield and the guys over at Slasher Studios do. Earlier this week, I got a chance to check out their latest, a holiday themed slasher, Dismembering Christmas. As with earlier Slasher Studios releases, this is yet another enjoyable example of what an independent company with a passion for the genre can manage to accomplish without a huge budget.

Dismembering Christmas centers around a group of teenagers who are celebrating the holidays together, away from their families, at a lake house owned by one of their fathers. What begins as a weekend full of drinking and partying quickly takes a sinister turn as the group gets a visit, and ominous warning, from a local wandering by. When night falls, the group begins to disappear one by one as they are stalked by a masked killer out for revenge, who has a past connection with the secluded cabin.

That plot description may not sound like the reinvention of the wheel, and it isn't. That's the thing about the slasher genre, most of the plot lines are pretty paint by numbers. You get a group of kids, throw them in a secluded location, and have them killed off one at a time by some sort of masked killer who most likely has a past connection with either one of the kids and/or the location. Throw in some nudity, inventive kills, and a plot twist at the end, and you have yourself a movie. It's what slasher fans expect, and enjoy. That's why I love Slasher Studios so much. They deliver old school slasher films for fans of the genre because that's what they themselves are.

The cast all performs well, with the standouts for me being Baker Chase Powell as Mark, and Nina Kova as Sam. The both played well off each other, and delivered believable performances. Effects wise, everything is practical, so fans of the real stuff will undoubtedly enjoy the gore. The kills themselves range from tame to deliciously clever. I always love it when the holiday decorations in one of these movies come in to play, and let's just say I don't think I've ever seen a better use of a Christmas wreath. The killer looks good, the pacing is almost perfect, and all around this is just a really fun holiday horror film.

With Dismembering Christmas, Slasher Studios once again managed to capture the magic of an 80's slasher, just as they did with Don't Go to the Reunion and their other films before it. The difference this time though? Polish. For as good as Reunion, Popularity Killer, Teddy, and the others are, they are admittedly a bit rough around the edges. Dismembering Christmas adds some finesse, camera work, a tight script, and other little enhancements that makes it their best production to date.",1443744000,5,2757,4.655030800821355
7358321,1,B012S10KRQ,"Only good thing was the score and setting tbh. Everything else was bland, boring, and the kills were a joke as well as the D level acting. 2/10.",1443657600,2,144,4.178571428571429
7358322,4,B012S10KRQ,"If you enjoy movies like Black Christmas and Silent Night Deadly Night, you will be digging this movie. This movie features great suspense, an awesome score and a cool looking masked slasher....what more could you want for this holiday season? I watched this one before it was released as a reviewer and I will be picking up my copy to rewatch again soon.",1443312000,3,355,4.650793650793651
7358323,5,B012S10KRQ,"Over the years, countless holiday-themed slasher films (mainly set on Halloween) have came and went. But it has been a while since I've seen holiday horror with as much of a rewatchable quality and such creative and fun deaths as Slasher Studios' Dismembering Christmas.

Don't Go to the Reunion writer/producer Kevin Sommerfield teamed up with Survival of the Dumbest director Austin Bosley to create this lovely winter slasher. From start to finish, it's oozing with Christmas cheer but slowly the feeling that something's not quite right creeps in and the characters are blithely unaware of it. Each character has their own distinct personality and are so well played by the actors that you truly care for them when bad things start happening. The cabin setting feels like a perfect blend of the Paramount Friday the 13th films and Raimi's The Evil Dead and the beautiful Christmas decorations and lighting bring it all together. Dismembering Christmas feels like the winter Friday the 13th film fans have wanted for years and have finally received.

For an independent low-budget slasher, the acting, writing, and cinematography are all top notch (complete with beautiful, long tracking shots that will please any cinephile) and each and every character feels like a real small town teenager. Each and every one feels like they could be your neighbor and someone you know and that makes you concerned when they start getting picked off one by one.

Without many spoilers, I have to point out that the deaths are some of the most creative and fun ones I've seen in a very long time. Think wreaths, candy canes, and Christmas trees can't kill anyone? Think again. Each and every death oozes with holiday spirit and the killer's costume is near perfection. To top it all off, a wonderful soundtrack composed by Beasta Music's Dylan Curzon (who also worked as the gaffer on the film) is made use of in the most creative of ways and coupled with some fantastic foley work.

If there's one problem with this movie, it's that it's only a little over an hour in length. This movie could be three hours long with these characters and deaths like these and I'd be hooked. There isn't a single dull moment in the film and all the characters feel like real friends who bicker but deep down truly love and care for one another.

I don't like singling out certain actors (because each and every one brings something unique to the film), but I have to say that Nina Kova's Sam and Leah Wiseman's Emma are two of the best of the best. They almost feel like sisters and it's hard to believe that they haven't known each other their entire lives outside of the movie. They both have so much chemistry together that it makes the hour and seven minute runtime a breeze to watch.

If you're in the mood for a fast-paced, gory, creative slasher film with tons of holiday atmosphere and great cinematography, look no further. Slasher Studios has outdone themselves with this latest feature and I can't wait to see what they accomplish in the future.",1442880000,,3030,4.783938814531549
7358324,2,B012S10KRQ,"Fast forward to the middle of the film. You won't miss anything. Nothing happens except (spoiler) we meet the killer. It's one of those 'well duh' moments. You see it and you just know. People start dying and, as is typical for this type of flick, nobody notices that people are gone. And when we do get to see the killer unmasked there's a disconnect. There's no real explanation, no overriding motive. You don't go Yay! And you don't feel sympathy. Total disconnect, as I said. The characters are okay. And at least they are distinct, they have their own personalities. But this is just your basic bunch of ""kids"" in an isolated chalet getting knocked off. And with no gratuitous t&a, why bother?",1451001600,,698,4.637096774193548
7358325,2,B012S10KRQ,Come on really. I get it it's 2015 and anybody can make a movie these days. Horror movies are super cheap and in abundance. So it's my own fault I keep buying and watching this stuff. I had read this was on Horror Underground's top 20 horror list of 2015. Bah humbug. This movie was an hour long and a waste of that hour to boot. Bad and not much to talk about. I've seen over 600 horror movies this year and I will never be revisiting or talking about this one again.,1450483200,,468,4.043010752688172
7358326,1,B012S10KRQ,"The acting was bad, the dialogue was stiff and the plot was a paint-by-the-numbers slasher cliche. Young adults in an isolated cabin get picked off by a killer who's unmasked in the end. There's nothing interesting about this movie. Don't know why it was a Kickstarter campaign because I see no point in making this film. Only watch if you're desperate for a Christmas horror movie. Only good thing about it is the title. Yeah.",1450137600,,427,4.706666666666667

7358330,1,B012S10KRQ,If there ever was a blood and gut's horror fan then i am definrtely it. I like all the 80's slasher movie's and just about anything with going camping in the woods and someone taking their revenge. On the other hand this movie was waaay to drawn out it just didn't have the slasher feel good your gonna get it attitude for me. I was really hoping for a good movie but was regreting watching it at least half way thru it. As they say you cant win them all and this movie just couldn't pull it off.,1444435200,3,496,4.071428571428571
7358331,5,B012S10KRQ,"It's evident that the filmmakers behind Dismembering Christmas have a talent for creating disturbing and creative death scenes that only the true love of slashers could inspire.  Bosley is fresh and energetic in his direction of the film, which is a nice compliment to Sommerfiled's and Goltz's  screenwriting involving a vibrant, youthful cast.  These fun slashers are a nice break from the mundane horror films that are poured out by the truckloads today that have very little, if any, classic value.  As for a complaint I read about ""D acting,""  I would like to offer the perspective of  a tongue-in-cheek acting style that fulfills its objective effectively  - consider it an homage to many of those final-girl slashers of the 80's.  While this movie charms and subdues the audience with the comforts of those familiar traditions, including that likable and strong female lead and the plot of the killer revealing itself with intrigue, it ultimately delivers that long anticipated, twisted back-story every brutal killer deserves to tell....after initiating a remarkably demented blood-bath, of course, which is the highlight of Dismembering Christmas.",1444176000,,1156,5.348066298342541

8726489,5,B012S10KRQ,"This was a great old school slasher. There was plenty of gore and suspense. I couldn't figure out who the killer was. It was a fun b slasher one of the better ones I've seen in the last ten years. The Final girl in this was great. The acting was solid for a horror movie. You don't get Gary Oldman acting in horror more like Malcom Mcdowell which is good.

  It's fun movie with the characters out in the middle of nowhere in a cabin partying with a killer on the loose. I think if you are a hardcore slasher fan you will love this one. People who are not crazy over the sub genre in a slasher might not like it. I am a big slasher fan and I own all the great ones and bad ones.

  I would rent this one first and if you like it then you should add it to your video dvd collection. I watched it 4 times already. Cheers!",1521590400,,819,3.9036144578313254
8726490,5,B012S10KRQ,"Ah, Christmas, the most wonderful time of the year... Unless you're stuck in the middle of nowhere with a psycho killer!

I love Horror movies. I love Slasher Horror movies. I also love Horror movies that involve storms, cold weather, or isolation. This film has all of my favorite elements, all wrapped-up in one blood-drenched package. Although there are some technical flaws here and there, I totally enjoyed this little flick! I've also found that it's one of those movies that the more I watch it, the more I like it. What the movie lacks in acting chops or technical precision, it makes up for in atmosphere (I LOVE the ever-present howling wind!), a quirky vibe, and some odd, humorous moments. This movie has heart. You can tell that Slasher Studios loves what they're doing and I hope to see more from them in the future.",1485648000,,830,4.684931506849315
8726491,2,B012S10KRQ,"This was definitely low budget. Loud background music playing so loud, that you can't even hear important dialog. It would have been better silent or low sounding music, especially with no subtitles. Picture quality ok, but I've seen better. Looks like it was filmed by someone that doesn't know about sound, editing, or better lighting.  Its not terrible, but it's predictable, and only lasts like an hour an 12 minutes or so. It is better than some of the other attempts at christmas horror however.  I'd give it a 2.5, just on par with average. I wouldn't pay a high price for this one, but worth the rental.",1478217600,,611,4.648148148148148

8726496,5,B012S10KRQ,"Dismembering Christmas is a prime example of a modern day holiday slasher. It really, truly irks me when reviews say: ""A love letter to 80's horror"". But Dismembering Christmas is just that, a love letter to 80's horror. The cinematography in the film is actually really great. I've seen a lot of lower budget films with little, to no movement and I lose interest pretty easily. I'm not sure who the DP was on Dismembering Christmas, but the actors and the DP should feel extremely accomplished with some of those chase scenes and even more so, the party scene. All in all, I really dug this film and I thought the cast was phenomenal. I'm also glad to have gotten the limited release on VHS and the DVD, though I ordered through Slasher Studios website and not through Amazon.",1455667200,2,777,4.597122302158273
8726497,4,B012S10KRQ,"I bought the blu ray of Dismembering Christmas awhile back and recently had the opportunity to watch it. I personally really enjoyed this movie from Slasher Studios and I am looking forward to purchasing Don't Go to the Reunion.
Dismembering Christmas is a fun little independent film that was made with a lot of heart. It doesn't really come off as an independent film due to the high production value. You never really get the feeling that you are watching a film with a lower budget.
The acting is also a bright spot for the movie. For the most part, the acting is top notch and I feel that everyone did an amazing job with their parts.
I also must state that I really enjoyed the mask and look of the killer. Definitely creepy!
The only problem that I really had with it is the lack of on screen kills. I can understand due to budget restraints, but I would have liked to have seen some more on screen kills. This is just a personal preference and it didn't really take away from the film.
Overall I recommend this film to anyone who hasn't seen it. It is probably not going to be everyone's cup of tea, but those who do enjoy it will probably put it on rotation around Christmas every year. I know I will.",1455408000,,1210,4.334801762114537
