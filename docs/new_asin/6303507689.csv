667967,5,6303507689,"Christmas is a-comin', and this'd be a great gift for, oh, just about anyone.  I saw the movie before I read the book.  Except for one major plot twist (in deference, I suppose to Mr. Newman's leading-man status), the  book is wonderfully faithful to the spirit of Mr. Russo's exceptional  novel.  The cast is great (Mr. Willis can actually act, if he has a mind  to), and a fitting tribute to that great lady, Jessica Tandy. The musical  score, the cinematography, the superb acting all around: they add up to one  wonderful movie.  I 'm surprised it hasn't been ranked with ""It's a  Wonderful Life"" as a must-see holiday classic.",943315200,5,631,4.654545454545454
667968,5,6303507689,"How refreshing to watch a movie that is reality-based and poignant as well!  This is what life is all about.  Although Newman is ""Nobody's Fool"", it is wonderful to see that he finally gets the message...he is  right where he is supposed to be! He is needed right where he  is.

668152,5,6303507689,"What couldn't Paul Newman not do in the illustrious career he had?  He was a great man and a great humanitarian.  What Newman displays here is his great everyman qualities.  You do not sense that he is giving so much a performance but immersing himself wholeheartedly into the soul of a working man.  He's not so such playing Sully but embodying him.  Though this is a star vehicle Newman demonstrates his generosity towards his talented ensemble probably getting career performances from Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith.  Writer-director Robert Benton imbues this film with a richness that makes you feel as though you are a part of the upstate New York community it is set in.  Because this understated film had the misfortune to come out the same year as ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Forrest Gump"", and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" it was criminally overlooked.  ""Nobody's Fool"" should be at the top of anybody's list when screening a Newman retrospective.",1515628800,,947,5.0256410256410255

The feeling of a slice of life in a small upstate New York town pervades the film entirely, to the point that the geographical location is almost a character of its own.  A movie that was re-purchased twice as the household went from VHS to Laser Disc to Blu-Ray.

Also partially set on Thanksgiving day, in a somewhat offhand way, Nobody's Fool provides the sense of the winter season in that part of the USA, and delves into the nature of family in the way the holiday season often does.

668236,2,6303507689,"Review of Nobody's Fool
Hot Toasty Rag, July 10, 2017

Im too much of a classic movie buff for my own good. I just cant accept a movie that starts with Paul Newman asking a woman to run away to Hawaii with him, she laughs him off, and he ends his speech with a dejected, depressed, Hang in there, before ending the scene.

In Nobodys Fool, Paul Newman plays a limping old-timer who drinks and plays cards with his friends, and hits on his buddys wife. If someone else was cast in the lead, maybe I could have seen it with a more open mind, but when Jessica Tandy scolds heartthrob Paul Newman for not walking fast enough, it just breaks my heart. If you don't feel the same way about him, you can try to get through it, but its still not very good. It very clearly came from the 90s, which in this case isn't a good thing. The irredeemable scoundrel friend, the harmless flirting, the unrealistic quips between father and son, the gratuitous Melanie Griffiths nude scene, the no-good, over-the-hill guy who changes his ways for no good reason. . . See what I mean?",1499644800,,1064,4.3686868686868685
668316,5,6303507689,This movie is a real treat.  Paul Newman is great and the unaccredited Bruce Willis is a stroke of genius.  You will love this story.,1498608000,,133,4.28

The remainder of the cast are all wonderful as well, with great turns by Margo Martindale, Jessica Tandy and Gene Saks (as Newman's not so great lawyer), as well as from half a dozen other actors playing memorable characters.  I've watched this movie at least 5 or 6  times and it only gets better with every viewing.  I cannot recommend this movie enough.  If you haven't seen it - why the hell not?!",1493596800,,567,4.62

668983,5,6303507689,"An excellent treatment of Richard Russo's novel of the same name.  Staring Paul Newman, Jessica Tandy, Melanie Griffin and Bruce Willis (who actually acts in this one) it centers around ner-do-well Donald ""Sully"" Sullivan (Newman) and his generally fractured relationships with family and neighbors in the fictional small town of North Bath NY.  To borrow from the GoodReads review:  ""follows the unexpected operation of grace in a deadbeat town in upstate New Yorkand in the life of one of its unluckiest citizens, Sully, who has been doing the wrong thing triumphantly for fifty years.""  Newman's wonderfully nuanced performance shows why he was a leading man for nearly fifty years.  BTW: those interested might enjoy the mini-series ""Empire Falls"" (also based on a Richard Russo novel) starring Newman and is, in effect, a sequel to ""Nobody's Fool"" with different character names.

The film is by turns, dark, funny, touching and painful, just like most real lives.

 I had read the book and my husband had not.  We both enjoyed the movie.  It is clearly a story that Mr. Newman and the rest of the cast wanted to make.

669184,5,6303507689,"What's not to like? -- Jessica Tandy's last movie (at age 84 or so), Paul Newman at 70, still a charmer, nice turns by Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith and everybody else in the cast.  Sentimental? Yes, of course -- but it has a quality that, say, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" doesn't have, in the sense that Sully Sullivan (Newman) doesn't have to be made aware that his life has been worthwhile for us (the audience) to see two things; (i) that he has wasted a lot of it, and probably will continue to waste a good bit; and (ii) despite the fact that he has disappointed many people AND himself, to some degree, his relations with his neighbors in his small town in upstate New York show that his life in a sense preserves theirs.  In different ways, he gives two women confidence: his landlady, Beryl (Tandy) is able to keep living in her house because he is there; and his flirtation with Toby Roebuck (Griffith), the neglected and serially betrayed wife of Sully's sometime employer (Willis) gives Toby confidence in her beauty and desirability -- and eventually gives her the strength to leave.  And why, we might ask, does he keep employing Wirf (Gene Saks), his alcoholic, one-legged lawyer?  And it matters to him that he keeps employing his rather immature helper, Rub (Pruitt Taylor Vince).  These are people whose lives are vulnerable, and Sully looks out for them, as he does for poor mad (or demented) Hattie, the mother of the cafe-owner.  The great thing is that Sully interacts with all these people in the most natural way, even though he is in many ways a failure -- as businessman, husband, father.  When his son (Dylan Walsh) shows up, with two children, a marriage in trouble, and no job, Sully tries to help him out, and it's interesting that the conversations they have about the damage caused by Sully's absence as a father from his young son's life indicate that this doesn't come as a revelation -- Sully and his son have known this for years, and Sully will even admit that his son's stepfather has done well by his ex-wife and his child.  He generously accepts other people's weaknesses, and -- more wryly -- his own.  Psychologically, it makes more sense than the preachier and more fantastic ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and seems to me much the more appealing movie.",1466121600,,2289,4.646039603960396

Very true to the spirit and intention of the source material, Richard Russo's novel of the same name, while making some of the changes necessary to translate it to the big screen.

669401,4,6303507689,"The older Paul Newman looks pretty darn good! So good, in fact, that he makes his ne'er-do-well character, Sully, more appealing than he otherwise might be. Sully works construction, or whatever is around, drinks--a lot more moderately than one would guess--and hangs out with a (mostly) touching bunch of local characters. Having abandoned his son years ago, the son, an out of work college professor, turns out also to be someone who just can't resist Newman's--I mean his dad's--charm. So big-hearted is Newman's Sully that even when he has the chance to run off with Melanie Griffith, about half his age and very attractive, he turns it down in order to be--presumably--a better grandpa than he had been a father. The feel is pretty genuinely Richard Russo, although somehow Russo's novel seemed just a tad less sentimental than this film.",1463356800,7,843,5.0285714285714285

Great plot and character development, understated, powerful perfomances.  Even from Bruce Willis.  This guy has a great future if he ever gives up on action mories - although I did love Red and its sequel. : )

It is not a contradiction to say that this movie has small-town pacing but is never slow moving - becaucse life never really is, either.

The years have gone by too fast for some characters.  They realize this before it's too late - but will they do anything about it, anything new?

669816,4,6303507689,"This film wouldn't be nearly as successful without the wondrous understated performance by Newman.

He plays Sully, a small town man who has long since lost his family due to his drinking, and who never amounted to much in life, but still has a sharp sense of humor, life, sexuality, and even rage burning in himself at age 60.

It's also a genial slice of small town life, related to Benton's 'Places in the Heart', but less treacly, and with a less Hollywood spin. The characters (a terrific supporting cast including Jessica Tandy, and both Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith doing some of the best work they've ever done) are off-beat, without it feeling like writer/director Benton was sweating hard to create 'quirky'.

Nothing all that much happens in the film, yet people grow and change, just like in real life.

Not quite a great film, but it still captures a sweet, almost Caprasque Americana, without becoming cloying. The movie, like Newman, never pushes hard, and that goes a long way.",1452902400,,998,4.818713450292398

671729,5,6303507689,"It was a very enjoyable movie; however, the movie is unusual.  There wasn't much in the way or action, or a real love story, or even drama - and some may feel the pace was somewhat slow  either in spite of those things - or maybe because of them  the movie was very enjoyable.  The characters, although flawed, were charismatic.  The movie was full of snappy repartee, and was actually quite funny (although often in a dry, dark, or cynical way)  my wife and I both laughed out loud multiple times.  The movie kept our interest throughout.  I tend to prefer action movies, yet I found this movie very entertaining.

671963,5,6303507689,"Having grown up in an Upstate New York town (Mayfield) just five miles from where the book's author grew up I found that this movie is just like being home, back in the '50s and '60s, with the smart-mouth answers, the nasty winter weather (which I long for continuously since I no longer live there), the rusty trucks, the run-down bars, the hard-nosed attitude, but under it all a warmth that is real but often hard to recognize.  Accurately depicts a neat blue-collar upstate NY town.  After a career in the military with our family living far away from Upstate I've told my adult children that if you want to know what it's like to grow up where Mom and I grew up watch Nobody's Fool.  It's a wonderful movie, one of about three movies that I watch at least once a year.  Newman, Tandy, et al are perfect.  This gets my highest rating.  The book is equally great!",1439337600,,866,4.415094339622642

Bruce Willis played the blas, unfaithful rogue well.  Wondered if his character would do an about-face toward the end (watch & find out).  Thought some supporting characters played their roles well, while others were so-so, but no actor detracted from the flow of the film.

Time stopped for both my husband and myself to watch this little gem, and yes, it seemed to have gotten better with age.  The book by Richard Russo was such a hilarious masterpiece, that we hesitated to think the movie- even with the all star cast- could do it justice.  But, this movie does.  This seemed like a movie that Newman really enjoyed doing.  He is stellar.

I found the movie interesting, although a bit depressing to watch at times because the lives of the characters were so sad. I could have done without the bare-breasts of the woman at the poker table and some of the profanity, but the quick chest flash that Meg Ryan's character gave Sully (Newman) was cute and said a lot about their connection.
Though I don't want it to be a spoiler, I will say I liked the ending of the movie. Funny. I'd actually have like to followed a few of the characters further to see some of life changes that would be coming down the pike as a result of Sully's decisions.

674567,3,6303507689,"""Nobody's Fool"" is a good film from 1994. It is currently available on NetFlix Instant Download Streaming. The director is Robert Benton. The novel is by Richard Russo, and the screenplay is by Robert Russo. What a gem! Apparently this film did have a theatrical run, but I had never heard of it until I saw it on cable a few years ago. Paul Newman was, as always, masterful. So was Jessica Tandy. As unlikeable as Bruce Willis is, he is a great actor and does very well here. And even though it was a fairly small part, I think this is Melanie Griffith's best work ever. The script, directing, everything came together seamlessly. I highly recommend this film. I gave it 3 stars. Dale Haufrect",1432771200,,694,4.515873015873016

674574,4,6303507689,Old man with a past and bad judgement goes through life his way. He runs into his son and his son's family over the holidays this year and makes an effort to make amends for running out on them. He shows that while having made many mistakes and continuing to make a few more he is a stand up guy looking after people he cares about. Could do without the profanity and Melanie Griffith showing her boobs but actually that fits for a many like guy I think. Really nothing scandalous here. Nothing really offensive. Just a man trying to get together showing we all don't become rich or want to. We all don't do what we are supposed to but doesn't mean we are evil.

674991,5,6303507689,"A film that reminds you that it?s the small thing that you do in life that define your passage through this world. The tone of this film is similar to Gran Torino but more family small town and homey feel. Despite his unappreciated status in a small upstate New York town Newman?s character has a great affect on the day to day lives of this very close-knit and interconnected town. At the age when most people his age are retired he?s divorced and still doing odd-job carpentry. Enter his son who is an associate college professor and two disfunctioning sons. He wants his sons to meet there grandfather and openly expresses his discontentment of how poor of a father Newman was when he was growing-up. He returns later and explains he?s no longer employed, his marriage is on rocky ground. He works for Newman to make some money to tide his family by and develops a greater understanding for his father. There are many well developed characters in this movie Bruce Willis plays the contractor who hires Newman for odd jobs. Willis has a heart condition but it does not keep him from philandering with his secretary and drinking and smoking. His wife is Melanie Griffith. And for those interested in seeing here breast here is your chance. Phillip Seymour Hoffman makes an appearance early in his career as Officer Raymour. The scene when Hoffman and Newman are called into Judges chamber is one of the most memorable scenes. The Judge in response to Hoffman firing a warning shot at Newman retorts: ?You know how I feel about arming idiots, if you arm one you have to arm them all, Otherwise it not fair sport.?

He and his wife are going through difficult times, as they arrive at his ex-wife's home for Thanksgiving.

Sully does odd jobs here and there, he hurt his knee while doing a job for Bruce Willis's character, Carl Roebuck. Melanie Griffith plays the wife and Sully has a big crush on her. Jessica Tandy plays Sully's homeowner, he rents a room in her home and Sully has become a son of sorts. Phillip Seymour Hoffman  plays a young, naive policemen always after Sully for one thing or another. Margo Martindale plays the bar owner of Sully's choice. Fun to see these actors as young characters.

Sully tries to establish a relationship with us son via his grandson, and you can see regret and guilt in his eyes and voice. Sully is liked by everyone, good to his best friend, a young disabled man. Sully has an off and on gamesmanship with the character, Carl Roebuck, played by Brice Willis. All of these characters are ones you would see and meet in a small town. Most of them doing the best they can, and scraping along. Paul Newman is a strong character and this role shows off his talents. Filmed in 1995, it is the quintessential film of it's times. It is good to go home again. excellent film.

675068,1,6303507689,"Syrupy sweet, boring, and a lack of any real conflict...Paul Newman the only thing holding this together. He says the f word at one part, that's about as climactic as this one gets. Not surprised it is based on a book, seems like the writers/director wanted to fit too much into the movie, without delivering on one solidly directed or interesting scene. Maybe the book was written at a 5th grade level? It never achieves any level of real gravitas, but wants to very badly. The world is just completely unreal and the mood is too quietly goofy.  I really hated this movie. Bruce Willis does some really bad acting.
There is this one part where Paul Newman goes to thanksgiving dinner to visit the family he abandoned. Upstairs his two grandsons are naked standing in front of a toilet and get this- the one grandson flips the toilet seat down while the other one is pissing. Now, unless that kid has a dong like an alligator, there aint no way in hell that thing is hitting his pecker. This leads to the naked boy running down the steps and causing all of your usual 'family' commotion - like grandma falling backward into the Thanksgiving dinner (completely unscathed, I assume).

Rough around its edges, this film has a lot of charm and humor. Newman is very convincing as a too-old-to-still-be-working, but down on his luck guy who has to keep his shoulder to the wheel in order to barely keep ends meeting. The supporting cast is outstanding with Jessica Tandy, Bruce Willis, and Melanie Griffith all adding to the interest. The wisecracks and situations range from hilarious to nail-biting and keep the story moving at a nice pace.

This movie is in no way family friendly and I really expected better from Paul Newman. I bought the movie because Jessica Tandy was in it and I did enjoy her character. Paul's character could have been great. I like a grumpy old man that drives around in an old truck and spends time at the diner. I think it was really the side characters that ruined this movie. His son annoyed me every minute he was on the screen and Mr. & Mrs. Tip Top Construction are hardly role models for the community. Whacker was also stupid. Also, while I did like the diner, the Upstate New York landscape is absolutely miserable looking. Anyways, I am not a fan and I do not recommend you buy this tape.",1418515200,,835,4.32484076433121

Whether we are aware of it or not, we are exposed on all sides to alternatives and options.  As this movie depicts, it isn't an easy row to hoe and it still has it's ups and downs.  Even tho the main character is suffering from the equivalent of PTSD, he manages not to pass it on to his own offspring.  I have seen this several times in my own life.  It is a tremendous gift.  The plot was a little over-dramatic in places, but that's the prerogative of the cinematic art.  Most importantly to me the movie depicted life in small-town America with many of its warts.  If more of us paid attention to these accounts, we'd appreciate how far we've come with the partnership of all our social, cultural and economic agencies and institutions.  We still have a long way to go.  We've practically poured gasoline on fire with our war on drugs, and who knows if we'll make it in the end as a civilization.

The redeeming qualities are getting flashed by a pre-40 Melanie Griffith and a prolonged topless stip poker scene with Angelica Page.  The brief thrills don't come cheap though.  You pay for them with a topless Bruce Willis, watching a 70 year old Paul Newman give Melanie Griffith tongue, and a couple hours of your life that you'll never get back.",1398729600,,485,4.4772727272727275

675879,4,6303507689,Paul Newman was great in this movie. I love the setting in old town America. Shows the struggles of making it in this world sometimes.  Melanie was great.  Entertaining movie; not their best but good movie for a rainy day.,1398384000,,222,4.525

675988,4,6303507689,"Paul Newman is wonderful in this role of the less than perfect Dad and grandfather.  It's a bit slow moving at first but it is an endearing tale.  The son does a great job as well but it's hard to imagine a son being this laid back after a lifetime of estrangement with his Dad.

Jessica Tandy is charming in her role as landlady.  And the one legged lawyer is a hoot.  Bruce Willis plays a not so evil nemesis.  This film captures the essence of the quirky characters of a small town and the complicated dances they do to get along.

Melanie Griffith is great as the secretary.

All in all this is a charming, quirky tale about small town life.  Enjoy the all star cast.",1398124800,,671,4.2204724409448815

676146,3,6303507689,It is a good movie but young people probably wouldn't care for it because it is rather slow moving. It did have a good story line and I happen to like Paul Newman. It's a little dreary because it takes place in the winter time so you don't see anything bright. It's really a character study of the character played by Paul Newman. I think it's a movie for the older crowd.,1397520000,,372,4.180555555555555
676147,3,6303507689,"I hadn't seen this film when it debuted in the movies, probably because it seemed to be a film too subdued for what I was in the mood for, at the time. This is a quiet little film about a quiet little town, set in the town of Bath, New York. I also hear this was the last film of the late, great Jessica Tandy too...which is sort of too bad. Yes, it is quite dated & there are some clunky, awkward performances from some of the supporting cast, namely Bruce Willis, whom I even half expected to turn the camera at one point, shrug his shoulders & tell us, ""Demi would not let me not do this art-y film with Paul Newman. Whatcha gonna do?"" In fact, there is a strangely inserted, unfounded ""strip poker"" scene, where only Bruce Willis & his Hollywood bottle blonde secretary character are nude, though Willis is shirtless, & the actress looks embarrassed: look closely & you can see she is trying to cover herself with her arms. I think that scene may have been a give to Willis, who, when this film was made, was at the height of his career.
However, there are some standouts performances, notably from Newman's supporting cast, which is rich with character actors: Jessica Tandy delivers, as always, as Miss Beryl, a stalwart woman, who is beleaguered by her officious, greedy son, though she maintains balance & humor in her life through the connection she shares with Sully her tenant, played with a dependable naturalism we have come to love in Paul Newman, another late, great actor of his generation. Another bold standout, from the late, great Philip Seymour Hoffman, who once again conveys levels of depth & humor in a role as the ambitious young Officer Raymer, who runs his beat to the letter of the law. PSH proves again why there are ""no small roles"". This officer is ""on simmer"", which boils over, with hilarious consequences, later in the film. And, adding to the bright spots is one of my favorite character actresses, Alice Drummond, who plays her role of Hattie with spot on comic timing, as a long time, well loved resident of Bath, who is becoming more senile by the day. The residents keep an eye on her as she sometimes slips into another reality.
All in all, it's a quiet film about a quiet little town that won't leave you pondering life's bigger questions, and it's a film saved by a handful of the cast, notably those actors I've mentioned.",1397520000,,2365,4.540983606557377

676330,2,6303507689,"I remember liking this movie when it first came out but didn't think it held up well upon reexamination. Paul Newman plays a quirky curmudgeon with a heart of gold surrounded by likewise quirky characters whose paper-thin problems don't really exist outside of the world of sappy movie-making. This has the feeling of being more a showcase for Newman than of being a film with a genuine story to tell filled with lots of idiosyncratic characters that writers love to write and actors love to play but after a short while, the  idiosyncrasies seem more like shtick than characterization. It's a slice of small-town life that doesn't really exist outside of a movie studio and the taste of corn gets to be pretty overwhelming not long into it.",1396656000,,741,4.7890625

I even bought the DVD after I watched it, it's one of those you can watch over and over and not get tired of. This movie had an amazing cast of excellent actors that played off each other remarkably well.

I could have possibly made some changes for the good.  I am not saying my life is bad but there may have been room to improve it.  With this being said, I would say very family rich, in-between and poor because way of life has no choosing and those that it hits don't realize it till it is too late.

676454,4,6303507689,"I gave the 4 stars for location.  I thought they picked a great place to film.  Now to the movie...  I read Richard Russo's book , Nobody's Fool and I liked the book much more than the movie.  I love Paul Newman but for me he was not,""Sully"", even though he was nominated for an Academy Award for the role .  He was too groomed, and nice looking and other Paul Newman things.  Sully was a down and out with a little grace but lots of pain.  The scenes with the younger wife of  Bruce Willis, who by the way was not the person to play this role either, never happened in the book.  It was suggested he had a thing for her but it was just a dream on his part.  Sully like to dig people in a wound already opened, this never came across in the movie.  Now Rub, I liked the actors portrayal he could have been just a little bit more sloppy and a little slower acting but the actor almost got Rub for me.
So watch the movie but if you have read the book be prepared,,,",1396137600,,963,3.9635416666666665

It's not a fast paced action movie, it's about life in a small town and how their lives intermingled and choices they've made in life. I don't know how I missed this one for so long as it was made in the 90's. I think it's worth a watch and I'm glad I did.",1396137600,,397,4.037974683544304

676551,5,6303507689,"The first time I watched the movie I did not pay close attention and I was not impressed by it.  I watched it later and suddenly the movie became clear.  When you first see Newman he appears as a handy man who is kind of irresponsible.  As the movie moves on you see that he is helping hold the lives of many in his community together.  There is a line in the movie that kind of sums it up.  Newman has to go to jail for punching a police officier (Phillip Seymore Hoffman).  As he is heading for jail he gives his grown up son a list of people he has to look in on.  After the list grows to five or six people his son says, ""It's not going to be easy being you, is it?""  Newman responds by saying, ""Don't worry about it.  I wasn't very good at it when I started out.""
The movie is worth watching for the dialog alone plus it has Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith in it.  It was the last film made by Jessica Tandy.  If you are looking for vampires and zombies, forget about it.  This is an adult movie.",1395705600,,1003,3.9849246231155777

676626,5,6303507689,"Thought this would be like ""Grumpy Old Men"" but it was not. It is a ""really"" good movie though. The main character is nothing like everyone thinks he is. He reminded me of my own dad, not the person he was expected to be, yet more than he was given credit for being. Sometimes we don't know the whole story, and we just have to find out what it is to understand someone else's point of view.

676730,2,6303507689,"I like Paul Newman, and I generally like his films. This one, though, is not his best. The problem with this film is it is a movie looking for a plot. It is a great character study, I give it that, and he does well in portraying an unusual character. However, you keep wondering where this movie is going and eventually it goes no where and ends. It is almost a film about a person in a small town and this becomes a rather boring study of his daily life. Not much really happens that is all that exciting, the climax is weak and when the film ends you wonder if you missed something. It's to bad because the film features Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith. Griffith plays the wife of Willis and flirts amusingly with Newman. You know this isn't going anywhere within the first few minutes. Willis plays the wise- ass that characterizes his performances, but with less enthusiasm than normal. In essence, if you want to see another movie starring Newman, see it, otherwise, I can't recommend it.",1395100800,,995,4.502762430939226

676792,5,6303507689,"The setting is mundane which allows the actors to be splendid. Each character is distinct, behaves consistently, develops individual character arcs and all are changed. That is a great film. Newman is particularly believable as the square peg, endearing, cantankerous and yet lovable. I liked it enough to recommend it to my screenwriting professor as a film absolutely brimming with metaphor.",1395014400,,393,5.459016393442623
676793,4,6303507689,It's a pretty story but takes awhile to realize it.  Newman makes the movie along with Jessica Tandy who the film is dedicated to.  It is a story of a seemingly harsh individual but underneath a very caring person.  The caring person is there but you don't realize it for a portion of the movie and then it all ties together.  Gets a little long in the middle but the end is terrific.,1395014400,,384,4.219178082191781

Unfortunately, Hollywood doesn't keep the family in mind.",1394841600,,351,4.421875

676923,5,6303507689,"Definitely a 5-Star movie with a 5-Star cast! A movie can be made with a host of top-notch, well respected actors and still not capture and hold its viewers. This is not the case with this movie!
First of all, I Love Paul Newman, Melanie Griffith, Bruce Willis, & Phillip Seymour Hoffman in one of his early roles. And I absolutely Adore Jessica Tandy! They, along with the entire rest of the cast make this film feel so real! I was instantly drawn to Paul Newman's ""Sully"" character and how everyone reacts to him with respect yet, with a bit of distaste.

Sully has a unique and close bond with each of his family and friends. He has such deep respect and fondness for his landlady, Mrs. Beryl Peoples, like a Mother & Son relationship. She sees in him a goodness that not everyone else can see. After all, Sully is a somewhat gruff fellow with a wisdom and cunning, (or should I say ""conning""), personality.

I guess the bottom line for me is, I am a small town boy and have known someone in my own life who reminds me of virtually every character in this movie, even the petulant little ""Wacker"" Sullivan!  This is just a well acted, incredibly scripted film with a cast  of characters that make me feel like I am ""Home"".",1394582400,,1225,4.407079646017699

I liked it because the characters are real, the acting superior, the story is anchored in believable (but not ordinary) human behavior and the drama develops in engaging steps.

I would recommend it to anyone mature enough to appreciate the credibility of the story.",1394323200,,357,4.933333333333334
677001,5,6303507689,"I loved Paul Newman's work and it was so much fun to see him working with Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith in such a meaty
role.  It's R rated because of a couple of ""breast"" scenes and some language but the movie was solid and fun.  It's about some pretty dysfunctional relationships in a small town and doesn't pull any punches but the underlying love and respect they show each other despite the occasional slur is heartwarming.",1394236800,,432,4.597402597402597

677077,4,6303507689,Paul. Newman aged well in his acting career and was able to play a range of roles. He played a good rebel individualist in younger days and did well here. Jessica Tandy was a terrific actress who did a great job. Watch that the kids don't see a few flashpoints in two of the scenes. I led the movie.,1394150400,,299,4.084745762711864

677081,4,6303507689,"An exceptional Movie about seemingly unexceptional human beings. You simply fall in love with this small Town and its people with their flaws and quite ordinary lives. Even Bruce Willis (not one of my favourites) comes through in this one. Jessica Tandy impressively makes another old character in her last Movie and Paul Newman is brilliant. Philip Seymour Hoffman does a small, but very funny, supporting role.",1394150400,,412,5.164179104477612

Paul Newman was a perfect choice for the lead role.  I won't spoil the story line by describing the movie, just that it is worth a look if you like a gentle movie.  Not sure that it is appropriate for younger children as there are two gratuitous breast scenes.",1394064000,,432,4.296296296296297

677285,5,6303507689,A great movie invites me to the party. Nobody's Fool did just that. Paul Newman played a flawed character with a heart of gold. I loved the grandson--cute and a great actor to be so young. I also enjoyed the character who played the best friend. Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith are not my favorite actors but Willis played his role well and Griffith was on screen just enough. Jessica Tandy was delightful. I hated to see this movie end. I miss the characters.,1393804800,,462,4.511904761904762

A couple of seconds of a topless woman might happen, but a couple of minutes of a woman sitting there with her big breasts feeling mentally raped destroyed this hopeless lives drama.

The story-line is superb and flows beautifully with a message that is so important in today's world. The supporting cast does a fine job as well, Bruce Willis plays a likable scoundrel and Melanie Griffith's performance is sultry, lovable and vulnerable.

Not only does it have an excellent cast:  Newman, Willis, Melanie Griffith, Philip Seymour Hoffman (not his best role), Jessica Tandy; but, it also has great character development.  Yes, it is not your typical action flick, the pace is slow, but the characters are captivating.  I've known people like this!  By the end, you really care what happens to them, a mark of good writing.  The film is not overly sentimental, although it deals with a somewhat dysfunctional father-son relationship that has its tear-jerky moments.  Nor is it melodramatic:  the action is believable, especially if you've ever lived in a small town.

677912,5,6303507689,"This film combines all of Paul Newman's acting qualities we've come to love from all of his movies before and after this one! He could have brought a lot more characters to the big and small screens, but alas...
The story is of alienation between family members, the newly rich and the underdog who's worked all his life, but has also ruffled feathers along the way. He has chosen the path of a no-good going-nowhere smart a$$, as it's the easiest way to not face his real strong thickheaded nature. He has not tamed his demons, but has capped them under a thin layer of nonchalance. Only a couple of women see through him though. Everyone else takes whatever he's selling. One of them is his landlady, who is the charming as ever Jessica Tandy. And the other is the beautiful wife of his no-good employer, who longs for him.
In the process of getting into more trouble than resolving it, Sully finds his long lost self and surrenders to it - to being a father, a grandfather and a good tenant. He also faces his past of fear and turmoil, and comes out a man ready to face responsibilities he's always omitted before. Something's gotta give though, and it's the love of his employer's wife...

677993,5,6303507689,"Nobody's Fool is a really lovely, sweet, funny, movie.  The scriptwriting is clever.  It's the story of a failed/failing construction worker (Paul Newman as Sully) who lives in a small Upstate NY-type town.  He has a bad knee from a construction accident, for which he is in-and-out of court to sue his under-the-table employer (a company owned by Bruce Willis - unbilled).  It's a sleeper of a story, until his life begins to be transformed by the unexpected arrival in town of his estranged son and family, and a relationship develops between him and his grandson.  There is romance (an unfulfilled flirtation with Bruce Willis' wife, played by Melanie Griffith), drama (a relationship with his landlady, played by Jessica Tandy, who still believes in him despite evidence that has lead her son, the town's banker, to want him thrown out), and all-out sweetness in the transformation of his character from pretty much a loner to someone who realizes he is loved and has much to offer his friends, family, and community.

The cast alone makes this film worth it - Paul Newman, Jessica Tandy, Gene Saks, Margo Martindale, Melanie Griffith, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Philip Bosco, Bruce Willis, Dylan Walsh, Catherine Dent, and Alexander Goodwin - but the dialogue is fast-paced, witty, and makes your heart skip a beat here and there.  The ""real-life"" feel, the emotional pull of the characters' lives, and the direction from Robert Benton all make this film a keeper.

Warning - there is some cursing, and a few scenes with breasts, so probably not the best for the kiddos.",1392595200,,1572,4.9505703422053235

But as for the movie, it seemed to want to be a Norman-Rockwellesque presentation and play to middle America, but the last third of it turned for awhile into a different movie, with harsh language and a topless woman sitting at the poker table next to Bruce Willis.  It was basically a pleasant if leisurely couple of hours with Paul Newman in a small town, playing a curmudgeonly anti-hero.  All the actors in this were good, and Newman carried the movie, and did it very well, but he seemed a little too old here to play a 60-year-old.  The movie was also Seinfeldesque, in that it was mostly a movie about nothing.  If it did know what it wanted to be, it didn't tell us, and I certainly can't put my finger on it, but it wasn't a bad movie, either, and if you like these kind of things you can't go wrong with Paul Newman and Jessica Tandy.",1392508800,2,1012,4.448648648648649

And, as you think about it, you realize that the movie was about Paul Newman and how, even at an older age, he was just so darn charming. Newman's character may be down and out, but you'd never know it by his attitude. The supporting cast is excellent, with Bruce Willis playing his part to perfection, but the real key here is Newman. His ""tough yet tender"" characterization makes this little movie about, really, not much into something worth watching. And, Jessica Tandy, in her final role, is just perfect.

A pre-plastic surgery Melanie Griffith as the wife of philandering Bruce Willis. Dylan Walsh as the emotionally abandon son of Paul Newman, a down on his luck Jack-Of-All-Trades man with a crush on Melanie Griffith and a debt to collect from Bruce Willis.  It's funny and heartwarming and not for young kids due to language and nudity.

 Paul Newman  as a senior still finding himself and seeing who and how he has effected friends and relatives in his life. The movie captures his strengths and weaknesses in the Autumn of his life. He is funny, caring and sad about where he has been, where he is and where he is going. This is truly a character study of a man and those who know him.
This was the final movie for Jessica Tandy and she shines. Bruce Willis  hits a home run and Mellanie Griffith is seIductive and beautiful . The rest of the supporting cast delivers their best.

It's age stereotyping is broken by the crossover ability of Newman between the reality of his actual age and the age in his heart and mind.

Sully is the hub of the wheel, a man with no money and seemingly no cares about anyone else, but in fact proves himself to be the town character everyone knows and depends on (not necessarily loves).

Paul Newman is perfect depicting Sully a genuine free spirit who wears the chains he has forged in life as though they were made of light weight fiberglass.  Quite a character in many ways, he appears to have ended his journey with a few more pluses than minuses, just like Paul Newman. I would recommend any book by Richard Russo and any movie with Paul Newman. The cast for this movie is full of talent and it is not wasted.

The characters are full of beautiful human flaws and yet, they live in a small town and like each other, despite their petty spats. Paul Newman gives one of the best performances of his career. The banter between him and Jessica Tandy is so touching to watch - and funny. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments and a couple of Kleenex moments as well. Perhaps the least well-known, best movie ever!",1384214400,,459,4.411764705882353
678406,2,6303507689,"The bad reviews of this movie are correct, I think. This movie is painfully lethargic and by my standards virtually unwatchable.

I've lived in my share of small towns and none of them were the painfully hokey candyland portrayed in this movie, where every hapless hooligan is ripe with sunshine and gumdrops. More like Jack Daniels or, these days, crystal meth. None of the scenarios or events in this over glorified Hallmark special even make remote sense: what are the odds that Sully would just stumble on his estranged son while walking down the road? Why did his son decide to move to Cooter's ville? What's the deal with that kid ""whacker"", I mean, really? Or a 30-something married women wanting to be sexually involved with a 70 year old alcohol ridden dead beat loser who ran out on his family? I don't care if he looks like Paul Newman or the real deal, Clint Eastwood, there is no sane woman alive, no matter how desperate, who would flirt with Newman's character.

Every scene is filled with this sort of contrived trite nonsense: the boring poker games w/ all his friends and enemies, the paul bearer scene (and NO they would NOT let you out of jail for that!), the constant snow blower stealing, etc. If this movie has a weakness, and boy does it, then it's the fact that it is has no real narrative focus, it isn't about anything! It's just over 2 hours of Pual Newman wandering around a small town at winter (how Norman Rockwell right?) doing random %*&@ because it's supposed to charm the pants off of you....if you're a 60 year old woman, I guess. But I don't care because I am not personally infatuated with the actor Paul Newman, I want a story with characters that I actually care about and this movie just doesn't deliver. The best, most coherent subplot is with his son and it literally goes nowhere, it comes out of nowhere like 30 mins in, gets visited a few times, dies, and then never comes back. Jessica Tandy! ahhhhhh! I live in crazy town!",1383868800,,1970,4.546478873239437

""Sully"" (Newman) is living in the upstairs of Ms Beryl's (Tandy) house in North Bath, NY.  Sully is about 60 (with a bum knee) trying to make his way in the world by working ""off the books"" at construction jobs.  Just a regular guy trying to get by.  He and his old truck are running on empty.  However, you will see that Sully (a failure as a father) looks after a lot of people in North Bath.  His best friend, ""Rub"", is a dimwit, his lawyer is not much of a lawyer, his employer not much help, and on & on.  He'd like to run away with the beautiful Melanie Griffith but he cannot abandon his town, his son, grandson, his friends, his landlord.  He's an integral part of the town.  Ms Beryl never gives up on him.  A lot of interesting characters and a good story set in a gloomy upstate NY.  I liked it very much.",1383782400,,908,4.1022727272727275

Instead, it was a beautiful portrait of dysfunctional people trying to put it together, trudging through the snowy season.  The characters are warm and touching.  I noticed that my husband was weeping, too choked up to engage in conversation with me.  He knew some of those people and missed them.  This was Jesica Tandy's last film, and was dedicated to her at the end.  What can I say about her, that you don't already know?  There is some nudity in it, but it was germain to the story.

(He did win several other major awards.) Newman inhabits the character of Donald Sullivan perfectly, with humor and humanity and rage and grief... perfectly attuned to the complex character he portrays. Beyond that, the film has a terrific sense of place: I feel I could be dropped off on any corner of that little town, and I would know where to go, and who I'd find there. It's a small town where the police chief is a regular player in the tavern poker game, where a schoolteacher can rely on and trust one of her former students because she knows he's better than his reputation, where a man can be let out of jail to serve as a pallbearer for an elderly lady's funeral... where the townsfolk aren't impressed by wealth, but, rather, stick with folks whose hearts are in the right place.

678656,5,6303507689,"Old men work until we die: forgotten members of productive society, no longer part of breathing souls in our post-industrial society of Unemployment & Corporate Investment in China, we all know the lost 50+ citizen who barely survives. Tossed out of every family, only drinking friends continue to know them. We sense their danger: most die homeless, with friends dying before them, and no means of support.

But, there are a few who can still stand - mostly on their own - with few remaining friends & patriots of America lost. Sully, boldly American and staunch defender of his own liberties becomes a grandfather. Unwittingly, at first, Sully realizes other members of his extended family have lives, filled with emotions, and they need him. Strangely, the old man arrives at the decision to include his family in his life; but, first, he has to finalize the delusion of stealing the most beautiful woman in North Bath.

Trauma and abuse rang in his childhood mansion on the hill: where Sully's father brutalized his own family, including our Sully. Despite his obvious leadership abilities and natural talents, Sully had squandered his impressive gifts. Instead, life was met with no sense of personal commitment: minimal wages, no plans for any future, and little or no earnings for child support. His son was grown, had his own family, and had lost his professorship when Sully's life refocused on today's news.

Every second, within every minute, of this tightly constructed play-movie is superbly crafted, acted, and intensely understated as American small-town, only. Newman knew what he held in his hands when he accepted Russo's divinely inspired work. The film is one of the best adaptations from an outstanding full-length book you will ever find in your lifetime. I enjoy the reality, and the closeness we enjoy from all the characters. Each character lives the days, Sully moves from zero to grandfather, his own tormentor becomes Sully's guest when he's thrown-out ... And, reward of his patience and suffering arrives in his home of friends as he stares down his father's ghost.

Through our lives, we've known - or, thought we knew - Sully in our city, town, or village. We had always wondered why there was not a higher purpose or goal for his intellect, status, or ability. Perhaps, we were too busy witnessing our own evolution and personal growth; or, it could be we forgot the Sully's of the world by dehumanizing their personal secrets that started at home. This film gives plenty to observe, and re-purpose our own shortcomings to extend our sense of humanity for the very real Sully we witness each day. Get out and find your old friends & schoolmates! Find out, What happened, and maybe this film can bring a smile.",1371340800,,2742,4.928571428571429

The cast is tremendous, from Paul Newman and Jessica Tandy, to Taylor Pruitt Vince and and Gene Saks, with an uncredited Bruce Willis showing he can really act.  Margo Martindale, an under appreciated character actor gives her usual fine performance as the local bartender.  Josef Sommer as 'The Bank' is a hoot.

Overall, one of my favorite small movies, it proves Americans CAN make features concerned with people and their lives without car chases and exploding buildings, although we do way too little of it.",1371168000,,687,4.652892561983471

It's my favorite Newman flick too.

Someone in another blog asked me why I identified so heavily with Sully. Knowing is one thing; explaining it to other people is a different matter. I'm giving it a shot here, but I'm also curious about others who identify with this fascinating character.

Sully cared about everyday people, the powerless. He carried a load of emotional pain--symbolized by his injured knee--but instead of letting his pain defeat him, it seems to have sensitized him to the needs and struggles of others.

He was fearless, spoke truth to power and took the consequences.

Every day, he was a loving friend and his love was returned by the townspeople.

He was old and weary in body--symbolized by his old broken-down pickup--but world wise and willing, intent even, to share what he believed important. This was brilliantly expressed in the scene where Sully gives his grandson a pocket watch and explains how to be brave. Even his blunt face-to-face criticisms of Roebuck seemed to be cloaked with the loving intent of making a better person of the younger man.

There are two basic kinds of people in this world--those who like things shiny new and perfect and those who see the value concealed in the flaws that inevitably appear. Sully appreciates the latter and is no slave to the former. Mrs. Beryl's broken railing wasn't merely a chore; it was a link between her and Sully that allowed him to show is love for her and for her to show hers in choosing him to fix it, with no reciprocity involved.

There were dozens of these loving exchanges between Sully and the townspeople throughout the story, like when Sully helped the demented grandmother get back to the diner, walking sock-footed in the snow and ice; then substituting still sock-footed for her daughter at the diner where she waitressed while she attended to her mother.

Like Sully, I had a rotten childhood and it sensitized instead of hardening me. I see honor in the overlooked heroisms of everyday working class struggle. I see love where others are repelled by poverty. I had a rocky marriage but raised successful children. I don't allow money to control my life but am optimistic about the outlook for financial comfort.

(This is all based on the film. The book is on my reading list. I'm sure it will hold up to my expectations after reading EMPIRE FALLS. By the way, EF was Newman's last film, just as NF was Jessica Tandy's. What great tributes to Richard Russo.)",1352592000,3,2629,4.733041575492341

Richard Russo should be very pleased with Robert Benton's adaptation, which fully captures the spirit of the book.  Robert Benton's direction is flawless in my opinion.

To view this film is to experience a true portrayal of people and life in the Hudson Valley, east of the river, (along with the lack of adequate street and sidewalk plowing).

a sharp sense of humor, life, sexuality, and even rage burning in
himself at age 60.

It's also a genial slice of small town life, related to Benton's
'Places in the Heart', but less treacly, and with a less Hollywood
spin. The characters (a terrific supporting cast including Jessica
Tandy, and both Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith doing some of the
best work they've ever done) are off-beat, without it feeling like
writer/director Benton was sweating hard to create 'quirky'.

Nothing all that much happens in the film, yet people grow and change,

There are not many movies that actually touch, so deftly and perfectly on these normal souls, mainly because the subject is too close to our real lives. We go to the movies to escape our daily grind.

A very memorable role for Newman, with excellent, strong supporting players, especially BRUCE WILLIS as Paul Newman's character's Nemesis...you know, that person in our lives that makes it a little harder to get through the day, and, to our consternation, who usually has it a little better, and not deserving of it, than we are.

678981,3,6303507689,"Paul Newman, in my eyes, is the greatest actor to ever walk the face of the earth.  His talent knew no bounds, and he showed that with ease as he effortlessly floated from one film to the next.  He exhibited such natural grace and charisma on screen, constructing what may very well be the strongest resume of any actor.

I think it's safe to say that he is strongly missed.

For me, `Nobody's Fool' is one of his crowning achievements.  That isn't to say that I think the film is particularly wonderful (as you can see, I gave the film as a whole a C) but his performance within it is outstanding.  Honestly, this should have netted HIM his second Oscar, not Tom Hanks!  Alas, the Academy is rarely smart enough to reward the most deserving performance, so I won't harp on that too much.  The fact remains that Newman's performance here (light, affecting, natural, layered) towers over many and actually elevates the film, which is dampened by a few of its own vices.

To get the negative out of the way; the film has a cheap feel which makes it seem like a `made for TV' movie and the script lags in areas, and that whole subplot involving the bank is poorly constructed and serves as more of a distraction than anything else.  While I think that the idea behind Peter's failing marriage is ideal for the development of Sully's person, it is handled strangely and doesn't totally connect, and the overall handling of Peter and his family (including his sons and mother) is weak and at times can take you out of the film.

Eh.

But, with all that said, there is something special here to be seen, and I totally recommend this film so don't take my criticism wrong.

The film tells the story of Sully, an immature elderly man who has squandered most of what he has ever had.  He abandoned his family years ago and has no relationship with his son Peter.  He has no job and his constant attempts at suing his former employer for a `work related injury' prove fruitless.  He has no love life, although he quite obviously pines over his ex-bosses wife.  His only true companion is an elderly woman who also serves as his landlord.  When he happens to reunite with his son, thanks to a series of odd coincidences, his life starts to take a deeper shape.

Sully starts to grow up.

The entire cast does an admirable job here; some more so than others.  Like I mentioned, Newman is the star here and it shows in every frame.  Bruce Willis is also top notch here, reserved and astute (how he missed an Oscar nomination that year, when he had this and `Pulp Fiction' under is belt is beyond my comprehension).  Jessica Tandy is appropriate here and Melanie Griffith is beautifully sincere and believable.  Dylan Walsh has improved over the years (his `Nip/Tuck' performance year after year is quite impressive) but he is the weakest link here, in my opinion.

In the end I advise you to see the film.  As an ensemble it works beautifully, every performance in step with the others, and as a complete film is carries a message and contains a brilliant performance by Newman, but I can't say it is perfect or even `great'.

It is a good film, that is all.",1292198400,2,3145,4.491197183098592

678985,1,6303507689,"""Nobody's Fool"" is set in a small town in upstate New York.  Although the movie is full of the star power of Paul Newman, Bruce Willis, Melanie Griffith, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Jessica Tandy it hardly keeps your attention.

The story is about Donald ""Sully"" Sullivan, an elderly part-time laborer who ran away from his responsibilities as a young man.  He left his wife and children years ago, but they all live in the same town together.  Everyone in the town knows Sully and most of the movie is spent in marginal activities looking for work, flirting with his boss's wife, drinking at the local bar, helping the neighbors and his landlady.  His landlady is played by Jessica Tandy and they have a special relationship.

Then one day things begin to change when his car does not start, he hitch-hikes a ride from his estranged and only son, Peter (Dylan Walsh).  Peter mentions not seeing him for three years and invites him over for Thanksgiving at his mother's home.  Sully shows up but it is not a pleasant Thanksgiving with the grandchildren fighting, and he also learns his son and wife may get a divorce.

""Nobody's Fool"" tries to make this a portrait of a small town and its interesting characters, both bad and good.  It comes through as monotonous and mediocre at best.  The story is slow and, sluggish, sometimes unbelievable.",1276992000,8,1343,4.745689655172414

Newman plays a broke divorced handyman working in a poor town that is run by the banker. Bruce Willis is married to Melanie who Newman has a flirty go nowhere relationship with. Bruce is also the source of Newman's paycheck. The banker, Bruce Willis, is a jerk but no one seems lily white here. The town is about to receive lots of jobs because of a large corporations expansion into their area & the local politicians & money boys are finally back into managing finances.

Paul's son loses his job as a college professor due to the bad economy in the area & wind's up going to work for the dad that left him & mom for years. Other poor town themes get involved but for some reason this never became tedious to me. It moves scene to scene with pace & follows a logical flow of events. If you like large & small breasts there are more sets towards the end of the show in a scene you'll recognize from a HAHA funny show.

Initially he appears to be a failure bearly making a living but as the movie unfolds we find that he is a pillar of strength for virtually all who he come in contact with.

In a scene where Newman has to spend some time in jail for punching a deputy his son says, ""You know, it's not easy being you!""  Newman's response is classic:  ""Don't worry about it.  I wasn't very good at it when I started out, either.""  This is a small movie with a big heart and wit.  If you are looking for a movie with blood, bullets, and bodies, forget this movie.

679108,5,6303507689,"This is a gentle, small movie about small-town living and its citizens, particularly a blatantly unapologetic ne'er-do-well named Sully (Paul Newman) who has lived his life exactly as he wants to and manages, by optimism and the bonding in this town, to survive quite well in spite of himself.

Sully has co-existed with his former eighth-grade teacher for apparent decades (the great Jessica Tandy, in her next-to-last performance), living in an upstairs apartment and doing - when he remembers to - odd jobs for her as well as keeping an eye on her. He is constantly at odds with her stuffy bank-manager son (Josef Sommer) who wants Sully out of his mother's house; Sully is also at mild odds with several other people in town, including his ex-wife, and an uncredited performance by Bruce Willis as Carl Roebuck, a local construction-site manager who is frittering away the family fortune on trips with floozy office assistants. The cast is stuffed with excellent actors and performances, at a time when some of them were just becoming known; Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a local policeman who makes Barney Fife look competent, and Melanie Griffith, as Carl Roebuck's exasperated wife, plays an excellent foil to Sully, who banters with her as he steals her husband's snowblower with her tacit consent.

The film meanders amiably along through the month between Thanksgiving and Christmas, as Sully deals with various small crises in his life and amongst the citizens of the town. There is a comfortableness about this movie that makes you want to just sit back and enjoy it; nothing momentous happens, just the normal give-and-take of a town this size, where everybody knows everybody and even the most hopeless members of the community are given plenty of slack (Sully is let out of jail to be a pallbearer at one point)and the clear affection amongst most of the community comes through plainly.

I absolutely love this little classic, and I believe it deserves to be on the shelf alongside everyone's favourite holiday movies; since it spans both Thanksgiving and Christmas, it could fit either.

I like Richard Russo's books. I'm fond of ""Mohawk"" and ""Empire Falls."" However, this movie manages to be as good as the book without being a direct translation. Paul Newman makes all the difference.

Newman won only one Oscar, Best Actor for his role in ""The Color of Money"" in 1986. I believe his work in 1994 was better with ""Nobody's Fool"" and ""The Hudsucker Proxy.""",1217116800,5,608,4.568807339449541

Jessica Tandy, oh what a lady and actress she was--this movie is definitely one to own and watch over and over.  Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith give outstanding performances. Newman's talent should have been recognized in this movie at least with an Oscar nomination but alas, he's missed several Oscars that should have decorated his mantle--The Verdict being one and Nobody's Fool his crowning achievement. He has perfectly captured the walk and ""hobble"" of a 60 year-old with a knee injury and arthritis. He and Jessica Tandy play off each other like best friends, she has an undying respect and appreciation for Sully (Newman) and he loves her and cares for her with such tenderness--best acting ever from these two in Nobody's Fool. There is such tenderness in the heart of Sully, Newman does a superb job showing the complexities of this true character in the town and of this film--he has never been better, ever.",1213833600,11,1073,4.852459016393443
679111,5,6303507689,"Both the original novel and the screenplay was writte4n by Pullitzer Prize winner ""Richard Russo"" (Empire Falls, Bridge of Sighs)so that well defined characters, a superb plot and a realistic setting began on paper. From that point, the finest performers out there were placed into the hands of master director and writer, Robert Benton to create this brilliant film. In a forgotten upstate New York town, Sully (Newman) is approaching retirement in a life that was based on labor that has left him with a destroyed knee, destroyed marriage and an estranged relationship with his son. He rents a room from an old woman who lives alone in a large house that used to be the Grand Dame of the town in years past. The house and street, like the woman herself (played remarkably by Jessica Tandy in her final acting performance)have become worn out, sagging along the roof lines and  a street sprinkled with large trees in various stages of dying; a metaphor that isn't lost on anyone. Outstanding performances by Bruce Willis, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Melanie Griffith, and Josef Sommers are just a few of the performances that create a world into which we become lost for a period of 108 minutes. Benton and cinematographer John Bailey have captured the gray bleak winter of upstate New York and both this ambiance and the town itself (like the Street mentioned before) become a character entity all on it's own.
  Paul Newman was nominated and won multiple acting awards for this role and many would say that the role suited him, thinking that this is how acting works, but instead, Newman was given a rare opportunity in Hollywood: the chance to perform a character that was so well defined and so flawlessly written and directed that an Oscar nod was guaranteed at the first table read.(It is interested that Newman would later play a supporting role in Russo's next film, ""Empire Falls"" for HBO Films). An actor of Newman's quality combined with all of the elements attached to this film create a vehicle for Newman that allows him to stand out along with a cast whose awarded hardware would more than fill the back of a pick-up truck. If you've seen the film only one or if you've not seen the film, it's time to rent or buy it. I decided that owning this film was the way to go because it gives more each time. As a portion of the script says:

Peter: It's not gonna be easy being you, is it?
Sully: Don't expect much from yourself in the beginning. I couldn't do everything at first, either.

thank you to the one time production company who managed to create magic for all history during the winter of 1993 whi8le filming and growing close in an experience that must have been beyond remarkable because the result, an outsiders look really, is a film that is only allowed a rating as high as five stars or superior excellence, when in fact there is no room to comment on how this motion picture will touch your heart, connect to your own life and change you for ever.",1212278400,7,2972,4.642585551330798

679269,4,6303507689,"This is a very entertaining movie.  I had heard nothing about it so it was a complete surprise.  I knew that Paul Newman would not appear in anything less than first class so I chose to watch it, knowing I wouldn't be disappointed.  I enjoyed every moment, mostly because of the incomparable presence of this eternally attractive man.  The rest of the cast was first rate, too.  I was pleasantly surprised by Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith and especially by Jessica Tandy (whom I rather disliked in Driving Miss Daisy).

I found the reviews of people who had read the book helpful and that probably explains why I failed to give this five stars.  They said that the book is darker and that this is a more Hollywood-ized version of it.  I did think that Newman's character was almost too cute and charming in the beginning.  He wins our hearts in the first scene, when I think the darker elements of his personality should have been portrayed. And he looks so good--perfect teeth and skin and hair and wears really nice clean plaid shirts in lovely colors.  I think that the ""real"" Sully, would have looked a lot more beat-up--like his pick up. Then we would have journeyed with him in the transformation process that the film shows.  It's too slick and quick and easy here.  Only the anger of the son showed the extent of the pain that Newman's character inflicted on him.

I wondered, too, about the relationship of Sully to the Melanie Griffith character, which, the film treats in a very light-hearted way, that doesn't completely justify the ending.  I suspect that there was more to it in the book.  However, as several other reviewers (who read the book) said, if you just want a good, entertaining movie, this is a good one.",1173830400,2,1734,4.620915032679738

679274,4,6303507689,"I watched ""Nobody's Fool"" for the third time last Christmas Eve, the difference being that this time I had just read Richard Russo's excellent novel of the same name. Robert Benton has done a brilliant job of adapting the source material, capturing the tone and essence of the story, while compressing 549 pages of text into 110 minutes of screen time. The film, set in North Bath, a faded little town in upstate New York, follows 60 year old Sully (played by Paul Newman), who is described in the novel as ""just a lonely, stubborn, unlucky man,"" between Thanksgiving and Christmas as he works to stay afloat with a bum knee, few prospects and ""a stupid streak"" looming ahead.

In the film some of the background stories have been trimmed out but are often hinted at through a comment or the action. In one scene, which is changed from the novel, Sully is in the abandoned house of his long deceased father and Newman is able to convey much of the pain associated with that physical space just through a subtle change in his facial expression. This scene vividly illustrates the strengths of Benton's adaptation - he trusts the audience's intelligence and uses the cinematic medium to tell the story. A lesser filmmaker would have used the novel's technique of inserting a flashback from Sully's childhood into the scene.

Benton's film lightens the darkness and desperation of Sully's life as it's presented in the novel, choosing instead to put greater emphasis on the humour that is also a major strength of the book.  The change in tone in some cases is also accompanied by a change in plot development. At times this variation from the novel is not entirely successful.  For instance, the film's depiction of the unfolding of Sully's relationship with Toby Roebuck (played by Melanie Griffith) seems less realistic than the way it's presented in Russo's book.  The novel is able to achieve this aim, however, by taking the time to devolop the character of Sully's son, Peter, significantly more.  But this is a minor quibble. The film compensates for this easily overlooked flaw through the many other pleasures it delivers, foremost among them the presentation of some very three dimensional characters.

The film is very well cast - I can't imagine anybody but Newman playing Sully, Jessica Tandy playing Beryl Peoples, Bruce Willis playing Carl Roebuck, Griffith playing Toby Roebuck and especially, Pruitt Taylor Vince playing Rub Squeers.

""Nobody's Fool"" is one of the underrated gems of the 1990s and I would strongly recommend it.  It's also a superb adaptation of an equally great novel.  Hopefully, for some viewers watching the film will lead to a wish to become more deeply immersed into its world by also reading Russo's book.",1167523200,9,2744,4.907127429805615
679275,5,6303507689,"I saw this in the theatre and as soon as it came out on DVD I purchased it. I must have seen this movie over 12 times now.  It is one of my all-time favorites.  Paul Newman is amazing as Sully the main character in this story.  The scenes between he and Jessica Tandy (in her swan song performance) exhibit in my opinion some of the finest acting in motion picture history.  Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith are even suberb in this film as is the entire supporting cast.  However, it's Newman who steals the show.  He is truly a national treasure and the world is going to miss him someday when he is gone.

This movie has everything - great writing, directing, cinematography, acting, etc...  Overall, I can't recommend this movie enough.  Everyone that I've recommended it to or those that have seen the movie with me absolutely loved it.  Also, it is very rare that a movie that's been reviewed as many times as this one has a five star rating.  Enjoy!

679276,5,6303507689,"Teaser:  An unsung classic of a film, deep, heartwarming, and brilliantly acted.  Set between Thanksgiving and New Year in snowy upstate NY, the film could be a part of your holiday film library.

Plot:  Paul Newman is Donald Sullivan, a 60-year-old odd-job man in a small, hardscrabble town.  His tangled web of relationships with sometime employer Bruce Willis, landlady Jessica Tandy, and a host of colorful locals slowly emerges and it turns out that na'er-do-well Sully actually is a vital component of his community.

Acting:  Just superb.  Newman is at his best and in her final role, Tandy is brilliant.  Willis, Melanie Griffith and Pruitt Taylor Vince is full of pathos as best friend Rub Squeers.  The supporting cast is also scintillating.  Of special note is an early role for Capote star Philip Seymour Hoffman, as local police bumpkin Werner.

Best Feature:  The script-- the Newman-Tandy repartee is great and the Newman-Willis dialogue just crackles.  There are enough memorable lines to make you want to take notes.

Also of note:  Good cinematography lends an authentic ambience and the semi-Celtic soundtrack is pleasant without being manipulative.

Mr. Spitzer is running for Governor of NEW YORK, and his comment resonates with many but offends others, thus, the controversy.

This movie, made years ago, validates Spitzer's comment and beautifully, but sadly, depicts the ""Appalachian"" character of upstate New York.

Newman was born to play Sully, a crusty old codger who is trying to sue his boss (a marvelously restrained Bruce Willis) for a leg injury sustained while on the job.  Into the picture comes his son (Dylan Walsh of Nip and Tuck, and very effective), whom he left when the boy was only a year old.  Newman has a cautious relationship that develops nicely, and offers Sully a chance at redemption.  Willis' lovely wife (a nice turn by Melanie Griffith) knows Brucie is playing around, and has become sort of a fantasy lover for Newman.  Newman also is the tenant of the divine Jessica Tandy (in her last role), whose banker son (Josef Sommer) wants her to sell her house and get rid of Newman.  Oscar nominee Philip Seymour Hoffman has an early role as the blustery yet bufoonic deputy, and Philip Stuart Vince is Newman's best friend who becomes jealous of Sully's new relationship with his son.  There's also a pretty fun running gag about Willis' snowblower, and it's all handled with utmost care by Oscar winning director Robert Benton (Kramer vs. Kramer).

Small, people-centered (rather than action-centered) films like this are increasingly rare, sadly, especially ones with such an impressive cast. It's sad that we've had to lose Paul Newman, but in one of his last central roles he absolutely eats up the screen as Sully, a cantankerous but likeable itinerant carpenter who has never managed to make much of himself. As he rebuilds his relationship with his son (Dylan Walsh), carries on a no-love-all-hate relationship with his boss (Bruce Willis), and flirts with an intimate relationship with his boss' wife (Melanie Griffith), Sully exemplifies the kind of small-town character that we've all known; no one says anything all that nice about them while they're here, but we miss `em when they're gone. The film also makes you feel the authentic cold of an upstate New York winter. Look for Philip Seymour Hoffman in a small, early role as a surly cop, and for Jessica Tandy in her last role, as Newman's landlady.

Watching Mr. Newman "" act "" on the screen is similar to watching any great art form. You know it's terrific, you know it's perfect, yet you don't know quite how it's done. Perhaps the reason you can't figure it out is because when Mr. Newman "" acts "" he somehow transforms himself into that character. You cease thinking it's Paul Newman up there, and actually believe it's ""Sully "", a worn out, down on his luck man, who, while watching this movie, reminded me so much of my late father that it truly was scarey. After viewing this movie, you simply cannot fathom anyone other than Mr. Newman in that role.

The facial expressions, the pauses, the movements of Mr. Newman are the indescribable little subtleties that show why he is a movie legend.( Folks, it doesn't get any better than this).

The movie is shot in just the right town, with just the cast, and just the right emotion. In my opinion, it is one of the 10 or 15 best movies I've ever seen. It's the kind of movie that makes you feel good inside, sort of like comfort food for the soul.",1117756800,8,1362,4.31640625

It's just that the book was so real, so convincing in its portrayal of its characters, that I couldn't help feeling that the movie was, well, wrong. Though I know the book was a fiction, I couldn't help feeling that the movie was betraying the truth that the book presented. As the scenes in the movie pieced together the highlights, I kept having two thoughts: ""wow, this is going by too fast; are we there already?"" and ""but that's not how it happened!"" At any rate, I'd like my review to be something a little more meaningful than just the self-important cliche, ""The book was way better."" Whether or not I will succeed is up to you. [end disclaimer]
The book was 550 pages long and rich in description, so I don't fault the movie for trimming story lines and collapsing others (e.g., Bruce Willis's character was a composite of at least three distinct characters in the book). In fact, this technique works surprisingly well for much of the movie; the story feels a little flatter, but the meaning is left pretty much intact. And I suppose that the filmmaker can be forgiven for softening up the title character and sentimentalizing him a bit in the very way that I pointed out the book did not. This is a Hollywood movie, after all.
I do find fault, though, with distorting the essential truth. Minor variations hurt the movie a bit throughout, but in one particular instance, near the end, a major breach significantly changes the whole point. I won't give it away, because it might ruin both the book and the movie (hint: it involves Melanie Griffith's affections), but it gives Sully more credit than he deserves, takes away something important from his son's character, and generally turns a fairly dark personality study into a warm, snuggly, feel-good moment. Eech.
As I expected I would, I have focused on the negative aspects of the movie, but, as I mentioned in my disclaimer, I think it was probably a good movie for what it was and I would still recommend it to people who have no intention of reading the book. The acting of the entire cast is strong (even Melanie Griffith and Bruce Willis are bearable), with especially high marks for the always-incredible Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jessica Tandy (in her final role), and Paul Newman, who is particularly good in the title role. And of course it had an excellent story to work with, which was, for the most part, told quite well. I guess that's the problem with reading books. They ruin otherwise perfectly good movies.",1068768000,25,2799,4.714285714285714
679444,5,6303507689,"I loved this movie, which is both funny and moving, when I saw it in the theaters. Paul Newman has never been better and he deserved the Oscar--I think the problem was not enough voters saw the film. We don't see many characters like the flawed one that Newman plays in Hollywood films these days--he's flawed but he is also totally sympathetic. There are wonderful supporting performances as well, fine writing by director Robert Benton, and a lovely score by Howard Shore. The movie is based on a good novel by Richard Russo, and Benton was able to capture the spirit of Russo's long book.",1063497600,7,591,4.6380952380952385
679445,5,6303507689,"This movie is truley everything a feel good movie should be. All the acting, directing and comedy in this film was done to perfection. This should've won best picture! Don't miss it! The only question I have is why it is rated R. It has just 2 breif topless scenes and very little bad language. The MPAA must've had beter things to do in the 70's because I've seen nastier, more bad laguage and nudity in the 70's movies that were rated PG then. This movie coul've used a PG-13 at best and I would even reccommend it for family viewing. Anything for young kids would go over their heads and this is a movie teenagers should see to a spice of real life without all the crybaby stuff that's in most drama movies. ""Nobody's Fool"" is a feel good movie that doesn't really bring any tears yet seems to tell the story of peoeple's lives. Hard working regular good people.",1063411200,2,865,4.37888198757764
679446,5,6303507689,"This is a touching film about small town failures who don't realise how many people count on them and how important their lives really are. Watching this movie you feel part of this blue collar, down and out town. Paul Newman's performance is among the very best he has ever given. He plays Sully with a irreverence and subtle sense of humor that makes this sometimes employed construction worker with a bum knee one of his most heartfelt characters. Jessica Tandy is his landlady who can see in Sully the heart and the man he truly is. There are fine performances by Bruce Willis and Dylan Walsh as his son Peter. Peter has just been fired from his job as a college English teacher and has driven with his wife and two children to spend Thanksgiving with Sully's ex-wife. Sully had abandoned the family when his son was growing up. But as the movie develops so does a bond and understanding between the two men. The most touching scenes are between Sully and his grandson.
The adaptation of Richard Russo's book is excellent. It captures both the comedy and the emotion of the novel. The photography captures the feel of a small town in the dead of winter. The movie pulls you in and moves you in special ways. You come to like Sully and understand him. In a way it also help you understand yourself. It is a movie well worth seeing. A small movie with a big heart.",1056326400,3,1366,4.468
679447,5,6303507689,"This is a gem of a movie that never created much of a stir when released. We are accustomed to perfect work from the likes of Paul Newman and Jessica Tandy and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, but director gets pitch-perfect performances from Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith (who was never better).
Nobody's Fool might not be a great film, but I'd argue that it is a perfect film. A film of character, not action, it opens up with quiet assurance and never puts a foot wrong. The writing is exceptionally intelligent, and you could watch it several times just to enjoy the witty banter between small town friends (including friendly enemies, played by Newman and Willis). But ultimately, there is a very serious point to this unpretentious movie. The big climax is nothing much in a way: Newman decides against running off to Hawaii with Melanie Griffith, but that act is an act of heroism and triumph over himself. He comes to realize, after a life of living just for himself, that he has ties of love and responsibility to several people more important than himself.
I don't recommend that you watch this film. I recommend that you buy it and then loan it out to all of the people in your life who mean something to you. They'll thank you for it.",1052956800,60,1242,4.599099099099099
679448,5,6303507689,"This well written comedy/ drama has much to offer. In many ways it is a portrait of small town america. Paul Newman plays a loner type, content with the decisions he made in his life. As his son returns too town, he gains the chance too reconcile. This is just one of the many plots in the movie, raning from the heartfelt to the hilarious. However, everything is believable. The charachters are sometimes odd, but they seem like people you could know. These charachters range from a despicable boss (a superb Bruce Willis in one of his most natural roles) to a one loegged lawyer, and everything in between. Truthfully this is a real joy too watch. From the constant bickering between Willis and Newman, to the slightly crazed policeman (Phillip Seymour Hoffman in a small role), the charachters are well written and well acted. This film is a rewarding expirience ijn every way. Look for the great Jesica Tandy in one of her final roles.",1030406400,6,939,4.662650602409639

I lived in one of the towns in which the movie was filmed and the director captures the town perfectly. The light is even right. Watch this movie. It's funny and sweet and warm and perceptive about people and family and relationships. And Jessica Tandy never looked more graceful in this her last film.",1028160000,8,591,4.6923076923076925
679537,5,6303507689,"For some reason I love this movie, and I cannot even pinpoint what make it so great. Sully(Newman) is a small town ne'er-do-well and the story revolves around him and his interaction with family and friends, among others his boss(Bruce Willis) and his wife(Melanie Griffith). Willis is actualy very downplayed and for once gets past his macho-a-smoke-in-my-mout-and-bleeding-on-my-shirt image. The story (more or less) begins when Sullys son(Dylan Walsh) come to town with his wife and kids to spend Thanksgiving with Sullys ex-wife, and the interesting play between father and son(and grandkids). The story is very beautiful and at times genuinly funny. Jessica Tandy is seen as sullys landlord(in one of her last roles).",1007856000,11,722,5.398230088495575

679539,5,6303507689,"Rare is the movie where everything fits perfectly, and this is one of them; Nobody's Fool insinuates its way into your consciousness. I never heard of the film until it made it to cable; what a shame. I suppose the lack of hype at release time was in character with the movie itself; everything is understated, from the script, the actors' performances, the location, the beautiful score, but all add up to a moving and believable work.",993081600,4,436,4.675324675324675
679540,5,6303507689,"Having just finished reading (and reviewing) the book ""Nobody's Fool"", I had an itch to see the movie again.  I remembered it as a warm (an odd adjective considering the snowy setting) and heartbreaking comedy about a man down on his luck, but not down on life.  I remembered right.
But that description does not do justice to this fine piece of work.  Sure, being familiar with the source material, which provides an abundance of background information on the characters, helps.  But it is not required reading.  For in watching the film again, I realized that it gives you all the information that you need.  Not with pages of prosaic exposition, but with a wink, a glance, a grin, and most telling, a sparkle in the eye.
The four gestures noted above could come from anyone.  But if you're going to do it right, why not go for the best.  Paul Newman is perfectly cast as Donald ""Sully"" Sullivan.  He has the combined capacity for the man's dry wit, quick tongue, and emotional sincerity, rolled up in a rugged but worn exterior that's not afraid to show hurt (be it physical or emotional).  It's a no-brainer to say that he does a wicked job here.  The real questions come with the rest of the cast.  They are a hit-or-miss bunch.
The ""hits"" include: Gene Saks (who directed ""The Odd Couple"", among other movies) as the one-legged attorney who sticks by Sully even though he knows that they make a losing pair; Pruitt Taylor Vince as sidekick Rub, who doesn't come off as pathetic as the character did in the book (how could he!) but pulls of with aplomb his simpleness and his endearing nature; Jessica Tandy as landlady Miss Beryl, who died postproduction and who the film is justifiably dedicated to; and even Bruce Willis, who's smug act I've tired of lately, gamely holds his own in his scenes with Newman.
The ""misses"" include: Dylan Walsh as Sully's son (my antipathy towards his performance may come from the fact that Peter was a darker and smarter character in the book, more akin to his old man; Walsh's Peter is more of a bland young man not fully formed yet); and Melanie Griffith, as the prettiest (and most put-upon) girl in town, is caught once or twice delivering her lines rather than inhabiting her character while she speaks, a sin amplified when compared to Newman's perfect ease of speech.  Thankfully, neither of these sub-par performance harmed the film's overall effect in any way.
Director/Writer Robert Benton does a fine job of collating Richard Russo's novel into a cohesive movie.  The novel, if filmed as is, would have been several days long; there is so much depth and texture there.  Benton manages to combine some storylines, excise others that weren't really needed, and still maintain the tone and flavour of the book.  In my estimation, what was a monumental task feels like it was pulled off with relative ease.  I know that's not the case, that hard work went into the story's deconstruction, but am glad as a member of the audience that it appears that way.
Just like it's source, ""Nobody's Fool"" made me laugh out loud on several occasions, tear up on several others, and the rest of the time left me with a happy grin, in awe at what I was seeing.",984700800,40,3193,4.642984014209591
679541,5,6303507689,"As a resident of the Hudson Valley in N.Y., I got to watch this movie being made, from start to finish, having done some minor work for the production company along the way.

These actors and actresses, with their combined talents, made it look easy in the final product. But having been there, seen that, I know now, and truly appreciate the depth of commitment that not only a Fantastic actor like Paul Newman can project, but actors in general.

Paul Newman and Jessica Tandy in two moving, late career performances that show why they're two of America's greatest actors.

Tandy plays his old grade school teacher , who is the only one in this small town who still has any faith in him.

This film contains Paul Newman's finest acting, ever. An old version of a cover of the video of this movie read ""aged to perfection."" That describes Newman's performance in this movie quite well.
