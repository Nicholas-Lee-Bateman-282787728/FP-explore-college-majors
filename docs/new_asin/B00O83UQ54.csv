6728948,5,B00O83UQ54,Great show!  Couldn't believe it was cancelled.  Finally on DVD...well all I can say is it's about time!  Just pre ordered mine.,1418774400,19,128,4.7272727272727275
6728949,4,B00O83UQ54,"This Jon Tenney and Rebecca Romijn vehicle was canceled waaaay too soon. The characters were fun, adventurous, and had just the right amount of sexual tension. The addition of their genius, ""idiot savant"" character Edgar brought a surprising warmth and depth to the series as viewers soon learned Edgar knows far more than anyone suspected.

The story is a take on the ""cop buddy"" type shows with playful jabs at one another, as well as exasperation with each other's methods of acton. Both are ex Secret Service agents, and both left the SS disgraced. King's (Tenney)  charge was shot at a political gathering, and he can't get over that it happened on his watch. [We learn more about this event through flashbacks throughout the series]. Maxwell (Romijn) was on the Presidential detail, and a screw up left her on her own and out of the SS.

She and Maxwell meet and team up to form a private detective agency, and this is where the series starts. If you like sharp humor and smart writing, this is a show for you.",1418688000,33,1016,4.633333333333334

6728965,3,B00O83UQ54,"This is a good show but not a great one. The leads are OK but the supports are a bit too weird for TV. The Geek and Forger especially, needed to be a little less in your face and a little bit more human. The Geek's size and close ups made him overpower the screen when shot with the Leads.  He was not a character that would draw people to the show. One wonders how the FBI ever solve crimes if their portrayal here is taken at face value. They are incompetent and if it wasn't for K & M nothing would ever be solved. The banter was OK but at times seemed forced and the leads often seemed ill at ease with the dialogue. Romijn was good in her role and got more at ease as the season advanced while Tenney was OK but at times laboured in his role. On the whole a good show, but it could have been better",1453507200,,803,3.9263803680981595

6728990,5,B00O83UQ54,"King and Maxwell was an incredibly good show and done in by the suits who do not appreciate a great series beginning. This seems to be a trend as some shows have obvious fan appreciation but the so called decision makers fall down and can't get back up. It seems they stumble over themselves trying to find the next block buster instead of appreciating what the fans see in a show and work to improve the ratings if need be.
For those wondering if they should purchase this first season I would say yes - this was a great show. The characters were great and the scripts funny and fresh.

I would like to add that the characters of King and Maxwell would have benefitted from a larger family of players. Not that they really needed this. Both were great as is. However the shows that the suits seem to think are incredibly well crafted and had super ratings were also the beneficiaries of a large central team cast. Let's take The Closer - a series that Tunney was a cast member in. The police team alone had about seven great members all of which had their own quirks and funny additions to the whole. Look at some of the police investigative series with a long run over several seasons. They all have a large central team of cast members to play off each other and make the series interesting. NCIS, Bones, The Closer, Law and Order, CSI Miami and the list goes on and on.

It is rare that a James Spader comes along to carry an entire show with a few other main cast members such as in Blacklist.

Sad to see this series not appreciated by the suits - if they wanted bigger ratings they needed to spend a few bucks on a larger central team. But as is this is a great twosome. And I might add a blonde not afraid to mix it up with anyone.

Great season !

6728992,4,B00O83UQ54,A great show ...so sad it was only given one year chance to explore compelling Baldacci's King and Maxwell series,1431043200,,113,4.7
6728993,4,B00O83UQ54,"This series didn't last long, though I think that had more to do with corporate decision making than the quality of the production, the writing and the acting because, in truth, ""King & Maxwell"" was a very good program with a lot of potential.
The series revolves around two former Secret Service agents who were ""retired"" after something that shouldn't have happened to the people they were protecting did, in fact, happen. Based on David Baldacci's best-selling books, the series featured Jon Tenney and Rebecca Romijn in the lead roles as private investigators Sean King and Michelle Maxwell. Both characters come with an armful of baggage: King was fired when a presidential candidate was assassinated on his watch; Maxwell was canned after one of her protectees was kidnapped. King went through a bad period; drinking too heavily and simply drifting until a friend helped him get his life together and into law school. A lawyer, he practices only occasionally while running his private detective agency. Maxwell has yet to make her peace with the fact that she is no longer with the Secret Service.
""King & Maxwell"" also featured three very intriguing secondary characters: A computer genius who is mildly autistic, a former forger turned tattoo artist and a severely buttoned-down FBI agent. The dialogue was snappy and, unlike some other mystery shows that feature men and women partners, King and Maxwell have no romantic designs on one another. That was a refreshing change for me.
What might have doomed the series is the fact that Maxwell is the physical member of the team. In most of the episodes she is the one who gets into fights while King would rather talk his way out of situations. Many U.S. viewers are uncomfortable with the idea that a female is the power figure in a business relationship: If you don't believe me then take a look at real world numbers that show most major companies and corporations are led by men, not women.
I enjoyed this series and wish it had been given at least one more season to see if it could have boosted its audience.",1430265600,14,2071,4.820224719101123

6729009,3,B00O83UQ54,"Sometimes, the critics are right. Some shows are just 'okay' like King & Maxwell and 'okay' just doesn't get renewed. I like Jon Tenny, thought he was great in The Closer as Chief Brenda's husband, Rebecca Romjin is beautiful and has improved a lot as an actress over the last few years. Having said that, this show strives to be something 'different' but fails in my view. My Wife called it a slapstick version of ""Castle"" which is pretty accurate. Its not a bad show and its awesome that we can now get shows that last only 1 season on DVD now cause sometimes you find a real 'Gem' (check out ""Golden Boy"" a fantastic 1 season cop show starring Chi McBride.

And guess what: I found it to rank with The Closer and NCIS as the best shows so far of the 21st century.  The other two, of course, had great runs and earned widespread acclaim. Along with King and Maxwell, they also were the only shows of this era that had a clean slate for season one: All excellent shows, no bummers. Can't help wondering: Why wasn't this great show better publicized? I mean, how can any show based on David Baldacci's writing genius and Shane Brennan's producing genius be anything but great?
