8606502,2,B00EKXWAJ2,The DVD cover says this is about 4 people in Madrid looking to ease their loneliness. My thoughts...it is a whole bunch of people making a confused and bad movie. I can honestly say I felt absolutely nothing for any of them. I love foreign films but this one..please take it out back and put it out of its misery. truthfully I should have gone one star but the guy on the cover is pretty cute.,1393200000,6,393,4.184210526315789
