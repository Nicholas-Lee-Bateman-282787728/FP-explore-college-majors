2216839,4,B0007LBM3Q,"Some things to know: On the low impact routine, Jane Fonda isn't even there, it's led by three other ladies. The Basic workout is good, it's short and includes lots of squats. I was a complete mess trying to keep up with the steps and really just wanted to get down to doing more strenuous work, which happens in the ""Abs, Buns and Thighs"" sculpting workout. This one uses simple hand weights and easy moves and leaves out the silly ""step-step-kick-step-aaaaaand again"". There's a full body stretch with Jane that pales in comparison to all the popular

Pilates and Yoga DVD's. One other thing that bothers me with  exercise DVD's is the lack of concern for repeat watching. So that 5 minute lecture from Jane Fonda on how I should strech, drink more water and get rid of my body ideals before the workout gets annoying to have to FFwd through. Every. Time. They should construct these so that you only need to push 2 buttons before the actual exercise starts. Also, my reason for ordering these is the women (though hideous in tan hose with thong leotards complete with belts, big hair and gold jewelry) are real women. I didn't want the current workout look of fake boobs, or a b-list celebrity showing me how to strip as exercise. These ladies made me laugh, but they kicked my ass. I'd take 80's tacky over Carmen Electra sleaze any day.",1131580800,29,1341,4.583333333333333
2216840,5,B0007LBM3Q,This is an excellent workout DVD for someone who hasn't exercised for ages because it's easy and fun to follow.  Good way to start a workout routine and to boost the energy.,1123632000,16,173,4.40625
2216841,5,B0007LBM3Q,"I recently dug up my old workout tapes and found the three pack of Jane Fonda smiling up at me. I figured I would pop one in and give it a try, see if the old girl could still give me a run for my money. You know what? I had a fantastic workout. Here is the deal, three tapes: Low impact aerobics & Stretch, Abs, Buns & Thighs and Total Body Sculpting. Each tape has two different workouts on it. The genius of this trio is that it comes with a workout plan, at least my tapes did and I assume the DVD does too. Because you have two workouts on each tape, if you follow the weekly plan and vary your workouts it keeps the ""workout boredom blues"" at bay. I assumed that a workout tape from 1995 would not be that great compared to all the ""high impact yoga"" and Pilates that is so popular now but it was refreshingly simple and fun!",1117411200,70,831,4.0120481927710845
2216842,5,B0007LBM3Q,"Almost 10 years ago, I got these in video form.  As a beginner, who had a total lifestyle change to include my diet, Mrs. Fonda's Personal Trainer series really helped me lose weight, tone up, and be fit. I lost 20 lbs and have kept it off.  I also had success after I had my son when I used her videos in combination with a 2 mile run 5 days a week. I also recieved complements on how my body looked, many people would ask me if I was a gymnast!:) Her workouts and fitness philosophy are right on.  I highly recommend this series for anyone just starting out.  They are easy on the joints, and have three women who demonstrate basic, intermediate, and advanced levels in each workout, as well as lead some of the workouts, so its not all Jane. The workouts really have some great basic moves for learning about the body in toning and stretch. The aerobics get the heart rate up, and the moves are simple.  The aerobics section does require a little bit of space, enough to walk about 5 paces in each direction. I've moved up in my fitness level, but I still use this series for toning, stretch and when I just want to burn a few extra calories. I alternate my workouts with other videos like Gilad, Kaehler, and the 8min(ABS/BUNS)etc series, and I recommend these too.",1115164800,126,1269,4.360169491525424

2216885,5,B0007LBM3Q,"Love that my all time favorite Jane Fonda workout is now on DVD. I used up two of her tapes and don't have a VHS recorder any longer. Lost 25 lbs first time I worked out with Jane along with walking, walking, walking. Thanks, Jane!",1385337600,,231,4.155555555555556
2216886,5,B0007LBM3Q,jane fonda really has the personality for being the instructor in these dvds. i have done them before and enjoyed it very much.  i like that they are low impact and i can do them despite my mid 50's age.,1384387200,,203,4.075
2216887,5,B0007LBM3Q,"I love this dvd.  Fabulous.  I am new to ""weight lifting"" and her 2 program (alternating days with different muscle groups)  weight exercises are just right for me.  I feel so much better after I do that particular workout (it's called Total Body Sculpting part of the dvd. As Jane herself says on the dvd "" Its not like i wake up and say ""oh goodie, i get to do squats and lunges today, but i do it because it makes me feel so good!"" Im paraphrasing here, but that is the general jist of what she says, and she is totally right.!  No dread factor in any of these exercises. I actually enjoy doing them, as I also enjoy Jane's sunny disposition. She is good at reminding you of the proper form, and as a newbie, I really appreciate this.  Cant say enough good about this dvd.  All 3 parts are wonderful!",1382486400,2,803,4.209150326797386
2216888,5,B0007LBM3Q,"Why is this DVD over $200?  I understand that it's an amazing DVD and a great exercise to get in shape at home, so it's probably at a high demand, but REALLY? Major rip off.  Is it because the DVD is not being made anymore?  I wish that  Jane Fonda please release  all her workouts on DVD and make them affordable.  Please and thank you.",1373673600,2,337,4.107692307692307

2216891,1,B0007LBM3Q,THE DVD WAS HAZY AND BLURRY.  IF I WOULD HAVE KNOW I WOULD NOT HAVE PAID NEARLY 300.00! I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED AND FEEL LIKE I GOT RIPPED OFF. !!!!!!!!!!!,1368576000,,154,4.133333333333334
2216892,4,B0007LBM3Q,I used Jane Fonda's workout video many years ago with great results.  Imagine my happiness to find this video still available.  The workout is enjoyable and upbeat.  No gimmicks just good and effective exercises.  In 2 months of working out with Jane I have gone down one size in jeans.,1367280000,,286,4.66
2216893,5,B0007LBM3Q,I had Jane Fonda's workout series on VHS.  The DVD is much better because it contained several works on one DVD.,1363996800,,112,4.333333333333333
2216904,5,B0007LBM3Q,I have used Fonda's workout for years. I have never been injured as she stresses proper form. Three great workouts.,1361750400,,115,4.8
2216905,5,B0007LBM3Q,Three wonderfull workouts. Very efficient. Buy this dvd if you want to be in perfect fit. Jane Fonde is really the best.,1356393600,,120,4.5
2216906,5,B0007LBM3Q,"I liked the work out, it is very effective for weight loss but you should do it at least 4 times a week to see quick results. All of the moves are easily done & they are very effective. Can be done in a small space.",1355011200,2,215,3.6956521739130435
2216907,5,B0007LBM3Q,"Jane Fonda Abs, Buns & Thighs has been my favorite workout since the 90s.  I wish today's videos were more like that one.  The videos anymore have too much going on and too many people invovled.  I like how Jane has it setup so that the beginner can follow one person, then there's the intermediate workout (which is the leader of the set) and then you have the advanced workout which is the 3rd person in the video.  That's perfect.  I like to do a mix of intermediate and advanced.  I've tried lots of other videos to mix it up, but none of them seem to be as well done Abs, Buns, & Thighs.  Even some of Jane's other videos are like the others with too many people in them, and too many angle changes.  I'm not super coordinated, so I don't like to get really fancy with my workouts and do a lot of dance moves.  I like the straight forward moves that get the job done right.

I love the stretch video.  I look forward to going through the motions - although, I feel like she doesn't spend an even amount of time on each stretch.  But I've done it so many times that now I do the routine without the video and use a gymboss timer to make sure I stretch evenly and long enough on each muscle.  Highly recommend this package.

Total body sculpting is great too.  I use it 4 times a week (do the Abs Buns & Thighs a couple days), and I can see results.  I do increase the weights, and I do more reps than the video, but I like the routine.  Again, it's straight forward, nothing fancy and I'm seeing results.",1340323200,3,1508,4.144827586206897
2216908,5,B0007LBM3Q,I have tried these exercises many years ago on VHS and I am so glad that it is now available on DVD.  I still think that this is the best instructional exercise video around. Jane's instructions are very clear and she motivates you to do the exercises -- maybe because she is Jane Fonda!  Every time I go for different workouts I find that a lot of the training exercises are based on exercises I have already done through her videos. I wish all her VHS videos are available on DVD. I would get them all.  I just wish that those who did the DVD took advantage of the now available digital format with a menu that allows the user to go directly to the specific chosen exercise. I still give it 5 stars.,1329782400,,701,4.2164179104477615
2216909,5,B0007LBM3Q,It is hard to find good aerobic dance workouts that are easy steps this one is the best.  You get a great workout with uncomplicated moves.  You have a choice to follow low implact or high impact dance steps or use a little of both.  You can't go wrong with Jane Fonda.,1328313600,,269,4.134615384615385

2216911,4,B0007LBM3Q,The original VHS programs all on one DVD.  I am back on the program now.  I expect it to work just as well this time as it did when I used it a few years back on VHS.,1290988800,,166,3.3421052631578947
2216912,4,B0007LBM3Q,Why has Amazon more than doubled the price on this item in the last week or two (I can only think it's because demand spiked after Fonda was on Oprah).  Boo Amazon!  Buy it from collagevideo.com for under $20.,1288742400,2,209,4.333333333333333
2216913,4,B0007LBM3Q,"This dvd wears me out, but I am so happy I got it! I think it has a made difference already with my body. Jane Fonda is the best person work out too I think! This dvd was totally worth it! I Love it!",1282003200,4,199,3.5454545454545454
2216934,5,B0007LBM3Q,"Great workout up to the standard set previously by Jane Fonda. Always interesting exercises that can be modified if you are unable to perform all the moves and can be added to, perhaps with extra arm movements, to use a bit more energy.
Not just walking on the spot but dance-type steps that are easily performed in the lounge room at home without moving all the furniture or kicking the table.
In between Jane's older and new workouts, I have supplemented others but always come back to Jane, over and over, and I wish Jane made them more frequently.",1269820800,2,551,4.575757575757576
2216935,4,B0007LBM3Q,I really enjoy the two alternating 'total body sculpting' sessions on this DVD.  I've done the 'low impact aerobics and stretch' and like it too; but it does take a lot of time.  I'm glad I bought it.,1269216000,3,200,4.2368421052631575

2216937,3,B0007LBM3Q,"The aerobics portions leave something to be desired - unless you really like country line dancing.  The weight-lifting portions, though, were good.  If you are buying the  DVD on sale, it would be worth it.",1266019200,3,206,4.828571428571428

2216939,5,B0007LBM3Q,"I bought the vhs tapes of this collection almost 10 years ago and still use it today. The Abs, Buns & Thighs Workout is great when I'm short on time (25 minutes) and it really brings up the heart rate, works the legs and abs. I bought the DVD for fear that someday my tape wouldn't work anymore. I own a dozen or so different workouts and rotate them all for variety. I have my favorites and this is one of them.",1252195200,4,412,4.036585365853658
2216940,5,B0007LBM3Q,"In 1986 I got into doing Jane Fonda's Low Impact Aerobic tape. It was a great workout that I did 5 nights out of 7.  My cardio vascular system was so much better and my body toned up.  I did this exercise video for nearly 3 years until I got into running.  In 1991 right after I had my son and wasn't quite ready to start running again, I did this exercise video again.  I lost all the weight I gained in pregnancy and it acted as a trainer so I could start running again. Now 22 years later, I have some joint issues so running is not an option.  I really wanted to get my 1986 VHS tape on DVD - wasn't to be found. So I found this Jane Fonda workout and it suits my needs.  The adage is everything old is new again - that definitely works here. For anyone who wants a good at home workout - I recommend this DVD. Jane Fonda has perfected the art of aerobics.",1250812800,3,860,3.9421965317919074
2216941,3,B0007LBM3Q,"I tried to use the low-impact aerobics section and could not follow it. There was no instruction or step-by-step description of the moves. They were too complicated and too fast to learn just by watching. They seem to assume you already know the moves and just need to be told which one is coming next. I used to use Jane's low-impact aerobics tape from 20 years ago, that Jane led herself, and that one was described as it went along and was easy to follow. Not this one.

Also the sculpting parts require weights, which it doesn't say on the outside of the DVD, and seems to assume you already own them (or the DVD is supposed to come with them) and doesn't list what all you need.

I was disappointed.",1246752000,2,704,4.366412213740458

Even though it seems short, the warmup and cooldown is just the right amount and has never resulted in any injury even when I used heavier weights and did both sections of workout together.

I've tried countless other videos by such outfits such as Crunch, Self, The Firm, Samba Party, and Billy Blanks and find that Jane is still the queen. She provides a variety of routines and fitness levels from which to work and she's clear and concise. However, I think it's just her constant nudging to get better, instead of the yelling or cheering in your face, that really sets her apart. She challenges you and yet lets you know that it's all right if you're not quite there yet--don't worry, you'll get there.

Some of the routines can be confusing but once you catch on its great. I have used some of Jane Fonda's other videos and I like this one almost the best. The total body sculpting workouts are the best and really make you feel like you've worked out muscles you didn't know you have or that you wouldn't know how to target.",1181520000,6,447,4.149425287356322

I have not been disappointed. I think that it is well-balanced with aerobic activity and toning.  Jane and her partners give great instructions.  Jane puts some humor into it as well. I thought the music was good.  I am not that well-coordinated, so I know that you can do it if I can.  Beginners should not get upset if they do not get it right away.  Just have patience.

In it she's used fitness experts to give you a terrific yoga-based workout in just 20 short minutes.

To tell the long story: I work out with Mrs. Jane Fonda's VHS tapes since 1986. So, the story lasts 20 years. Indirectly, this story expresses my warmest thanks to Mrs. Jane Fonda for her work on these tapes (but, since she had worked with Mr. James G. Garrick - the author of ""Peak Condition"", it seems to me not at all surprising that I feel secure in ""her hands""). In other words, the exercises are safe and are easily adapted from beginners mode (represented by Mrs. Fonda) to the advanced mode.",1143072000,6,631,4.096774193548387

The routines are fun and easy to learn and very effective.  I was disciplined and consistent then and in 6 weeks I saw dramatic improvement in my appearance and stamina.  Since then I lost my routine and was in great need to start again.  The only series I really felt compelled to follow again was this one.  Although it is not the newest series on the market, Jane Fonda has produced a program that is timeless because it is realistic, challenging and very empowering. I really like the way she talks to you before you begin the program; I like her instructions; and I really like the other leaders she has for some of the routines.  I can't stress enough how respectful the approach is on this program.  I like all the routines, but my favorite is the stretch program.  My entire body feels relaxed at the end and my head is very clear.  If you want to succeed in a home trainer series and be happy while you are doing it - this is the one to follow! Kudos to Jane - I wish she was still making exercise programs.",1141171200,45,1192,4.372727272727273
2217023,3,B0007LBM3Q,"I bought this DVD series in hopes that I'd be challenged and stimulated. Well, I was challenged at least.

There are 3 25-minute exercise routines on this video. The total body sculpting routine requires weights, which I didn't know until after I purchased it. The other two routines are mainly led by two other girls, Kim and Michelle. Jane only does the warm-ups, cool-downs, and lunges. Another discomforting fact is that Jane is the one doing the low impact movements - that doesn't make me feel challenged to pursue higher impact movements since she's not even doing them!

The low impact aerobics & stretch and abs, buns, and thighs can be alternated, which is a bonus. While at first they are a challenge to learn, the movements are very boring and repetitive - grapevines, a few kick moves and some punching. There were also some ski-type of moves which were extremely boring and just made me more tired. I wasn't at all impressed with the movements, and the girls that lead the exercises seem positive and upbeat, but are not encouraging or comforting at all.

What's positive about this video is that when Jane does lead the exercises, she's very take control and will guide you thoroughly. The sit-ups are especially great on the abs and she does a variety of different kinds of ab work, such as pelvic thrusts, side crunches, and combinations. The lunges, too, are really great on the thighs. Her cool-down method is a little weird, though, and I don't really get anything out of the stretching she does at the end of each routine (while sitting, she places her hands on the floor behind her buttocks and asks you to stretch out your legs so that your thigh muscles will get a nice stretch, but then wants you to turn your head over your shoulder, which does absolutely nothing). A couple of the moves are really fun, such as one led by Kim which was an alternating leg movement which required you to do a pony-type of movement only slower, and use your arms as if you were waving in an airplane - very fun. There were a couple of other similar movements that were fun to do, as well, but most of them are boring.

The setting is a wooden floored studio with windows overlooking a city with shrubs and greenery, which might be a good setting for aerobics, but I wasn't digging it.

Overall, I wish Jane was more heavily involved with the routines instead of Kim and Michelle, and some more variety with the moves would have been beneficial rather than routine and boring.",1137369600,9,2483,4.608597285067873
