3883841,4,B002ACP2QI,"Everything is here. I always liked the Atlantis storyline better than original. It had more plots and villians and just more going on than the original Stargate which had only one set of villians and then had some trouble finding it's feet when they were defeated. These were pretty good. I bought the set even though I already have the 1st season, because it was actually cheaper to buy the set than to get each season individually!",1406505600,5,433,4.636363636363637

3883872,5,B002ACP2QI,"This is the most interesting of the three ""Stargate"" series for me.  The Wraith are amazing villains, with believable motivation & great powers.  I'll point out that while Joe Flanigan seems to be the star -- a majority of episodes are ""Shep in jeopardy"" -- if they need some real acting/emoting, a different character is used, usually David Hewlett as Dr. Rodney McKay.  (This was also true of ""Stargate: SG1"" -- Richard Dean Anderson was the star, and a majority of episodes were ""Jack in jeopardy"" but other characters got to most of the real acting).

Even now, several years after I watched the series for the first time, I'm haunted by the ambiguity of the way ""Vegas"" ends.  seriously!",1493337600,5,692,4.733333333333333

Its sci-fi in the Pegasus galaxy and has some corny elements but the main characters are well cast and make a good team.  I will probably watch it again in a couple years.

beginning. I watched all ten seasons on
TV, on the Comet syfy network. On the
weekend they would show stargate universe. I
really did not like that series that much I notice
they were not showing stargate Atlantis
at all. So I decided to buy Stargate
Atlantis,  I really did not see to many
episodes of this series, when it was on
TV. So I just decided to buy all five
seasons, I had to really get use to looking
at the different characters,getting to know
them, learning about Pegasus system an
learning about Atlantis.
But let me tell you, it has become quite
addicting, I am on the  third season, an
I love it!!! I wish this series could have
went five more seasons.  Stargate SG1
is real nice!! But Stargate Atlantis is
Beautiful to watch. I am so happy to
have this collection.!!",1475020800,2,818,4.368421052631579

3883909,4,B002ACP2QI,This series was not as good as Stargate SG-1 but it was still a classic sci-fi show that will go down in history of Science Fiction in my opinion Stargate series all the shows and movies are the only true rival to Star Trek there is no show that has been able to even come close to the Star Trek universe other than Stargate I feel Stargate can still go great places and do great things they have potential to make new series and more movies just because Stargate Universe only went 2 Seasons and did not do as good as expected doesn't mean that they  can't get out and start a new series for Stargate I believe the Stargate is one of the best shows outside of the Star Trek universe and I think it's funny that the crater of Stargate the movie thought  the series would ruin the idea of the movie and not go anywhere guess he was wrong Not only was there the Stargate Atlantis 5 Seasons but there was the Stargate Universe 2 seasons and then three Stargate movies from the TV shows Stargate continuum Stargate Ark of Truth and Stargate children of the Gods and of course it broke the science-fiction record for American TV shows Stargate SG-1 made it longer than any other TV show for science fiction 10 seasons Stargates are truly one of the best shows for science fiction that  has been made so far,1470700800,3,1301,4.323770491803279

3883914,5,B002ACP2QI,"Great bundle at a great price!  Loved the show from the start, and will watch the series over and over for years!  MGM giving up on this franchise is such a mistake!  Great sci-fi theme and love the tie in with the ""Ancient Aliens"" theories from ""Chariots of the Gods"" ideas.",1451952000,6,275,4.352941176470588
3883915,4,B002ACP2QI,"One of the big arcs of the ""Stargate SG-1"" series was finding the Lost City of the Ancients, also known as Atlantis. It also turned into fertile fodder for a spinoff series (come on, you KNEW they had to make one eventually). And though it had a slightly shaky start -- much like its parent series -- the following seasons saw ""Stargate: Atlantis"" blossom out into a solid sci-fi series with a legendary series, new alien parasites, and new nasty machines from long ago.

At the Antarctic base, Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) has finally figured out the location of Atlantis -- in the Pegasus galaxy. General Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) lets an exploratory unit to go to Atlantis, even though they don't have the power to return back to the Milky Way, and will be stranded there.

So Dr. Elizabeth Weir (Torri Higginson) leads an international group of scientists and military personnel to another galaxy, and arrive in the sunken Ancient city of Atlantis. After some initial problems, the ancient city is secured and has risen above the water -- but unfortunately the military unit, including Major John Sheppard (Joe Flanigan), have run afoul of the parasitic, life-sucking alien Wraith, who destroyed the Pegasus Ancients long ago.

And the Pegasus galaxy has plenty of its own dangers -- nanoviruses, spies, life-sucking bugs, cannibal Wraith, enzyme addicts, whales, an egomaniac baker, weird Ancient devices, Wraiths transformed into humans (and vice versa), ""alternate reality drives,"" Ancient artifacts, crooked businessmen, fear machines, a race of hybrid bug monsters, crystalline nightmare aliens, and a race of ruthless soldiers pretending to be Amish-like farmers.

The Atlantis base regains contact with Earth, but this may not be enough to save them from the Wraith's attempts to gain control of Atlantis, and an Ancient experiment gone horribly wrong. At the same time, Atlantis receives two new commanders -- first Colonel Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping), formerly of SG-1, and then the once-fussy Woolsey (Robert Picardo).

This series is less of a spinoff than a natural outgrowth of ""Stargate SG-1,"" and remains tightly tied to it -- the whole idea of the Atlantis base was introduced over a few seasons of ""Stargate SG-1,"" some of the ""SG-1"" characters (and the Prometheus) were also recurring characters, and Tapping was a regular. Teal'c and Daniel even drop in. And while the first season is a bit bland (""The romancing of the alien priestess? It's very 1967 of you,"" Rodney snipes) the storyline hits its stride in the second season.

And it has plenty of sci-fi staples -- ugly nasty aliens, tightly wound scientists, little tubular ships, explosions, moral quandaries and a bit of classic-style horror (just look at Michael's ""experiments""). But it doesn't lose its laid-back style, and the dialogue is a pretty entertaining diversion from the body-horror Wraith, with lots of one-liners and snappy exchanges, with the occasional pop culture reference (""It's the ultimate answer to the great question of life, the universe and everything!""). Most are from Rodney (""Just once, I would like to be taken prisoner by the sexy alien!""), and Sheppard (""But then I'd be The Man, and who would I have to rage against?""). But there's humor from everyone (""He put his hand in my forehead! How can you resist that?"" ""Well, I like to close my eyes and think of England""), including the Wraith (""I hope they prove as delicious as the farmers who grew them"").

One thing Atlantis does have is a high cast turnover, compared to the relatively unchanging cast of the previous series. But Flanigan has a nice O'Neillian snap to his performance (""I HATE clowns!""), David Hewlett is hilarious as the antisocial, ever-exasperated scientist, Tapping and Wigginson are solid commanders, and Paul McGillion is adorable as a Scottish doctor. And while Rachel Luttrell and Jason Momoa are never quite as endearingly alien as SG-1's Teal'c (who makes a guest appearance), they are quite solid as a psychic martial-artist and a rough-edged warrior.

""Stargate Atlantis"" loses a few too many cast members, but the storylines and aliens add a fresh dimension to the Stargate universe without losing their humor and horror. Definitely worth the while... but be up-to-date on the first series first.",1450396800,10,4306,5.1239316239316235

8359279,2,B002ACP2QI,"Watched the first three episodes from Volume 1, but was left unimpressed by the story.  I'm going to attempt to provide no spoilers.  The first episode, I think was the pilot, which went on *forever*.  The acting was hammy and there was a lot of scenery chewing by several of the actors.  Not sure if that was the fault of the actors, the director, or both.  The writing was all over the place, as if the writer(s) felt like they had to fit everything about the show into this one episode, and the editors whimsically pieced it all together in a haphazard manner.  The CGI was probably innovative at the time, but looks horribly dated by today's standards.  Who designed those terrible, poorly-fitted costumes?  Oh, and how is it that the nomads who never went anywhere and the Wraith all speak perfect English?

The second episode, which was probably the first aired, went over a lot of the same ground already covered.  We got to meet all the main characters (and a lot of the secondary characters) again.  The story itself didn't seem to go anywhere, since the purpose of the episode was to tell essentially the same story as the pilot and get the series rolling.  The acting and editing were a bit better, but the writing was still all over the place.  The costumes still look awful.

The third episode seemed to be about how many ways can we Earthlings insult and step all over the nomads that were ""rescued"" in the pilot, then have our arrogance vindicated by the end credits?  This trope was handled in a ham-fisted way.  The writing was a bit tighter but the overall theme left a sour taste in my mouth.  We see some improvement in costuming.

These three comprise what is on the first disc, along with a walkthrough of some of the interior sets.  The pilot's director guided us through, acting like he knew what he was talking about and generally behaving like a standup comedian who is badly flopping.

The bad acting and poor writing left me unimpressed.  The first disc in Volume 1 played with no problems, so I doubt any of the rest would have issues.

It's kind of sad to discover I don't really like this show.  Probably should've just picked up the first volume and not be out so much money.  I now have five DVD cases taking up space that could be used for better series.",1522281600,,2288,4.497572815533981
