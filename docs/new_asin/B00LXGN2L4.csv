6509985,4,B00LXGN2L4,"I have seen the first two episodes, the same included in this bundle, in japaneese with subtittles. I'm reading that there is a difference in voice actors, not sure how this will affect any relevance of my review.

I'm a fan of most things that come from Shirow Masamune, and my only real complaint is that this is an alternate reality of sorts(and the product placement), like how stand alone complex is different from the first two movies. The art style and story seem to indicate it could possibly be a prequel to the first two movies and maybe the events of the original manga, but it's definatley not part of the stand alone complex universe. It might be an entirely new story and universe alltogether, I can't really say for sure.

Without spoiling everything, I found the story to be decent considering it's a whole new continuity, they took advantage of the situation to redesign old characters and thier origins, some I was not fond of (Botou and Saito in particular) but the tachi/fuji/uchi koma equivelant, the Logikoma(logickoma?) was an excellent redesign combining elements of past versions to create something new.

Certain aspects of the story are smart, little hidden details and afterthoughts, other parts are hard to follow with at least one lengthy explanation that pins some things together, but could require a couple watchings to understand everything. It may not be absolutely spectacular, and the ultimate enjoyability may be altered by the third and forth parts, since these are only two of four episodes, but so far I like it, even if I didn't like everything about it.",1411776000,20,1596,4.881918819188192
6509986,5,B00LXGN2L4,"OK, this gray haired otaku loves the series, is almost certainly going for the package.  *Japanese dialog, English subs*, that and maybe a glass of sake or Black Asahi is only way to watch anime!  I have to be assured that this will be available!

6509987,4,B00LXGN2L4,"It's understandable why some fans of the original Ghost in the Shell might be furious about this new series, as it alters the original winning formula, so to speak. Besides a different voice cast (which isn't such a bad thing, to clarify), the somewhat predictable plot lines and - yes folks - product placement (Microsoft and Infinity, just to name two) contradict what made its source material so fresh and riveting. But as with all adaptations and reboots that diverge for the sake of validating its existence, not everyone will be satisfied for a number of reasons.

What remains the same here is its maturity, so these new OVA's still render the Ghost in the Shell franchise unsuitable for children, whether it be due to the violence or its philosophical ideas. Amazon shoppers should also know that there are a few options to watch Borders 1 and 2 of Arise. As of the time this review is published, both episodes can purchased digitally on Amazon for $8 each in HD ($6 in SD, but you don't want to do that!). That being said, you can judge for yourself the better value, but do consider that this $34 Blu-Ray/DVD set is a physical copy with some TBA extras included.

I've considered this reboot quite carefully, and I do agree there are some obvious pros and cons. But there's no questioning the painstaking update for today's otaku. Right from the first installment of Arise, you can see it in both the wonderful animation and effort to build an origin story that stands on its own. That is to say, both episodes included here are quite welcoming to the population that's never watched the original, or never even heard of it. By the same token, however, to please longtime fans, Arise may be too reliant on referencing the original. This is especially true in the second episode (heavier on action than the first), and it starts to become rather predictable. Fans with a keen eye will see it in scenes involving Motoko, the main character, and her tendency to lose a limb.

Still, even at its cliched worst, Arise does manage to have advantages over other current animes due to its willingness to tackle themes like the nature of reality (episode 1) and modern terrorism (episode 2). Compared to the original, Arise does a decent job in building Motoko as less sexualized and more of a vulnerable, conflicted protagonist. I also enjoyed its gravitas and updated cyperpunk feel, and those two qualities may be enough to draw a new audience. As for fans of the original Ghost in the Shell, loving or hating this series will depend on your view of the aforementioned changes they made. So the likability of this reboot is almost akin to the franchise's intricate world itself: it's not that simple.",1408665600,181,2704,4.72457627118644
6509988,5,B00LXGN2L4,"8/19/14 - Cast determined, it is all new. Not original cast.

Here's the facts:
-English cast is all new (yes, no long time Richard Epcar, McGlynn or other vets). So this will include subs and dub; No dub on the limited edition single copies. link to new cast members is in comments.
-Extras are also being included.

And my .02:
-Almost certainly makes this combo pack the best deal. period... Even with the extras undetermined.
-It's possible not all extras that were included in the Collectors Editions will be here. None the less, I've seen all the extras, and none (unless you can understand an untranslated interview) are worth the extra $$.
-Price alone is unbeatable (unless you opt for the digital versions). Add an English dub, and I can already say this is going to be a great buy.

Will update accordingly.",1407110400,25,818,4.706293706293707

6509993,5,B00LXGN2L4,"Before Ghost in the Shell became popular with Scarlett Johanson's GITS movie, ive been a big fan. I love all the movies, but truth be told i was a bit disapointed with the Stand Alone complex 1st and 2nd gig...maybe i have to watch the series over again, but from what i remember the Stand alone complex was a bit childish, not enough violence, but i liked the fact how the major was almost always nude. Anyways, my apologies to all die hard Stand Alone Complex fans in advance, but in my opinion Arise is far more entertaining, dramatic and violent than S.A.C. So regardless if u loved its predecessor S.A.C. or hated it, i strongly recommend Arise. Die hard fans will not be dissapointed and newer generations will absolutely love it.

6509997,4,B00LXGN2L4,"These first two episodes were a bit slow going and a bit rough around the edges, so to speak. I enjoyed this prequel series and found the new character artwork and voice acting refreshing but it was a slow start with a vague plot. In contrast, episodes 3 & 4 are much more familiar to a Stand Alone Complex fan with hard-hitting bang-em-up action and intense cyber warfare, ""in the trenches."" That's okay. There were some slow eps of SAC as well.

I feel it's helpful to note that SAC episodes were 20 minutes long each, so what we have here is equivalent (overall between Borders 1-4) are 12 episodes of comparable length to SAC eps. Not bad at all. The 1-hour format was done to tap into the ""American recipe"" with popular shows like 24 (according to director",1490486400,,761,4.474820143884892

6510009,5,B00LXGN2L4,"Im a huge fan of the original 1995 film which is in a class of its own and could never be outdone- as well as the follow up, Innocence. While the Arise series will isn't as heady and deeply philisophical as Oshii's films, its still smarter and more exciting than nearly anything else out there, building on the franchise in an effective and satisfying way. People who compare the older GITS movies to Arise, my response is simply to allow this new series to be what it is and refrain from drawing unnecessary comparisons. Old fans will enjoy watching this prequel and the inevitable formation and assembly of public security section 9.",1489104000,,635,4.678571428571429

6510019,5,B00LXGN2L4,"As a long time fan of Ghost in the Shell, I was thoroughly overjoyed when they announced Arise. Like many others, I was a bit unsure of Motoko's new look, but after sitting through the Arise Border movies and being capped off with The New Movie, I have to say I've really come to enjoy her new look --- in some regards, even more so than her Stand Alone Complex / 2nd Gig look!

The story of each Border is fantastic, insightful, complicated without being overly confusing, and entertaining. The quality of the animation is top notch, and these contain quite a bit more action than the original animated series do. I've now watched them a number of time and enjoy them as much as I do 2nd Gig, which is my overall favorite entry in the GITS Franchise.

Liked ARISE so much I actually own many ARISE PVC Figures of Motoko Kusangi!",1472169600,,829,4.411764705882353

6510027,4,B00LXGN2L4,Ghost in the shell Arise is a prequel series to the famous Ghost in the Shell series. I can see how GITS fanatics could be surprised and perhaps shocked by this prequel. GITS Arise is a reinvention of the story line that introduces a young Motoko Kusanagi and consists of four episodes. The animation is fine and the voice acting is good. I felt that GITS: Arise lacked the depth and dark overtones of the original. It's interesting to see how the characters could have developed into those known from the earlier episodes. The action sequences are good but its lack of menace ultimately lets it down.,1454803200,,601,4.626168224299065

6510032,3,B00LXGN2L4,"Ghost in the Shell Arise is another addition to the franchise. It's not as deep as the theatrical film that spawned it, nor is it as deep in its themes that come from Stand Alone Complex. However, the inconsistencies with previous works that this is trying to stand in as a prequel for leaves a lot to be desired story wise. Animation for these two volumes is very well done for an OVA, especially in set piece action sequences. Overall, if you are a newcomer to the franchise this is not a terrible place to start and I give this a hesitant review for hardcore fans.",1453334400,,567,4.3584905660377355

6510054,5,B00LXGN2L4,"Art work is great; Love the dual media, DVD and BR....system cannot play BR so the DVD allows play until I get a real HD setup.  I did see the Major's life being radically changed to allow her to build the team for section 9 for this new version of GITS shows.  Most of the original characters' personalities and appearance are similar to the pilot.  These movies are more ""PG13"" rated than the pilot release GITS movie with real nudity; here she's ""nude"" in a few scenes BUT no details to make it ""R"" rated so don't expect any fan-service.  My impression is our Major's cloths are more conservative,  her bust appears a few inches smaller and I believe she's also shorter/more girlish appearance;  here expect more complex plots with entertaining twists and many new enemies to vanquish with new victims to rescue.  As expected this is an open series; #4 ends only with the terrorist's search continuing; I hope for a conclusion with Arise 5,6 and hope we'll not see Arise 49,50 dragged on, on, on and out.  This series is the ground floor/beginning of a new slant on GITS and not a Star Wars type release of Ep. 1,2,3 with those blending seamlessly into old Ep. 4,5,6.  A good buy for a ""New Beginning"" of GITS.",1444780800,5,1213,4.527522935779817

And at the end of GITS 1, the Major disappeared, briefly re-emerging in GITS 2. In SAC, this has never happened. And yes, Arise does impliment changes to all of the characters origin stories.

I enjoyed the heck out of it despite quite a few complaints.  They got rid of the Technobabble and Cyberpunk tones to the show and it felt more like a Cop Drama with a lot of heavy action set-pieces.  It's actually really simple to follow, the story line ties neatly at the end, and the action sequences are amazingly drawn.
They also didn't bring back ANY of the original voice actors (I miss Mary Elizabeth McGlynn...), despite fans wanting the originals back.

It was a good set of movies (there was two of them) and I enjoyed them immensely, but it almost didn't feel like Ghost in the Shell.",1435017600,,634,4.3931623931623935

6510102,5,B00LXGN2L4,"Just finished watching ""Arise - Ghost In The Shell - Borders 1 & 2"" released by Funimation.
Jeff H. bought me ""Arise - Ghost In The Shell - Borders 1 & 2"" as one of my Channukah presents last year.  Yes, Jeff-Of-The-20th-Century does share my love for anime, amongst other things...[Yes Zack, you may borrow this if you want too...]
""Arise - Ghost In The Shell"" is the rebooting of the popular anime series that was spawned after the release of the widly acclaimed ""Ghost In The Shell"" anime movie which was released 25 years ago.
In these two OVAs - ""Ghost Pain"" and ""Ghost Whispers"" -, we learn how Major Motoko Kusanagi first won her freedom from the Japanese military establishement which basically claimed ownership of her and learn more of her mysterious personal history - which in-itself may be an implanted false memory; and how she came to recruit the first members of her freelance security team for Section Nine.
The relaiablity of memory and how it can be manipulated to further aims is the subjects of both these two Ghost OVAs.
The animation is breathtaking and the storyline reboot is well worth the price of admission.
Strongly Recommended!

6510106,5,B00LXGN2L4,"I've followed Ghost in the Shell (GitS) since first finding it in 1998. The art is rich and detailed in ALL the different iterations since the first movie and Arise is no exception. I picked up Borders 1 and 2 digitally on my Kindle and I'll say up front that the issue most have with new voice actors isn't an issue with me because I'm used to seeing the GitS world spoken in English so the new Japanese voice actors don't bother me. The story is set even before the original GitS movie while Motoko is still operating with Battalion 501. Personally, this younger version of Motoko is just what I would have expected. Raw talent, untested by much real world experience. In Arise, we see Motoko before her involvement with Public Security Section 9. She is obviously younger, not as experienced and somewhat of a hard headed brat who would rather work alone. Yes, there appear to be some slight Continuity issues in borders 1 and 2... namely how members of the Section 9 team meet and cross cooperate as opposed to the backstories in Stand Alone Complex but this doesn't detract much from the enjoyability of the stories. The action is fast paced, but its not all action. True to the original, Arise is layers and layers of intrigue heaped upon a technological back story. A must have for Ghost in the Shell fans.",1423267200,2,1313,4.567796610169491

I get the impression that it was more of a prequel of her past history, the team members and how they were allowed to be put together to combat cyber crimes in Japan. The dedicated viewers of the GITS series will be disappointed about Borderlands going over the past early series GITS stories in the original storyline. I doubt that I'll continue with the GITS Borders 3 & 4 when they come out in the near future.",1423008000,2,474,4.337078651685394

6510120,3,B00LXGN2L4,"The timeline takes place before the Ghost in the Shell movie. This is totally unnecessary as it doesn't add anything to the legacy. Considering the plot involves members of the Section 9 team, we all know how things are going to turn out, so absolutely no surprises, insights, or revelations are presented here.
  The animation is not fluid. Instead, it has a slight but noticeable flicker effect. Also, scenes of people walking but not moving are really old school anime amateurish and just plain silly. Watch Ghost Stories to see this anime phenomenon openly mocked.
  Unlike the previous two Stand Alone Complexes, which had multiple hours of episodes, here you only get two fifty-ish minute episodes amounting to less than two hours. This would be fine if this cost five to 10 dollars, but over twenty?? Definitely not worth it.
  The story has the usual overly complex convoluted plot as we've witnessed in the previous two Stand Alone Complexes as well as some great action sequences and cool robot fights. However, Motoko's origin here contradicts what was previously stated in a Stand Alone Complex story. Again, amateurish.
  All this being said, this is still an entertaining way to kill a couple of hours.",1421452800,9,1216,4.955665024630542

The first film is a little slow, but since it serves as a taste of things to come, it shouldn't be that surprising. The second film has much more action. What I didn't like was there is no scene selection in the menu, which is more odd than an annoyance. Hopefully, the next two films will be released in English.

I don't think that many fans understand something about Arise, so I'll put it here; this is NOT related to the SAC series or films; this is an AU, (Alternate Universe) to the series and does not even have to be watched first for first timers. That is why the character designs, voice actors, and the story is much different that the previous series/films.",1420070400,5,812,4.449664429530201

6510128,2,B00LXGN2L4,"This remake/retelling of the Ghost in the shell: stand alone complex is good but not great.  Certainly not worth paying $10+ per episode.  Honestly, ONE episode per disc?  For a box containing two DVD discs as well as two blu-ray discs, the entire project should have been contained in this one box.  What a waste.  I got this as a gift from a friend and I feel kind of guilty that they spent the money on just two episodes.  Save your money until its price plummets, or watch it online for free somewhere, which is how I got interested in this series in the first place.

Having said that, I thought the quality of the anime was good.  The actress who voiced Major Motoko in the original GITS series returns to play the voice of a military officer in charge of this series' Major Motoko, but someone else plays the new Motoko.  I really don't have a problem with the change in voice cast, but for some reason other people didn't like that change.  I thought the new voice actress did just fine, and I like both.  Much respect to the animators and the voice actresses/actors and everyone who actually made the animation, but terrible execution by who(m) ever had the idea to market it this way (referenced above).

As long as you don't mind paying $10 per episode or suffer from some kind of stupid sequel-syndrome, wanting the new stuff to be just as innovative and original as the first, then you'll enjoy this fresh take on Section 9's origins.

It was ""good"", but 1 ep on 1 disc, are you kidding me?  I got ganked by Funimation yet again.

6510131,5,B00LXGN2L4,"This G.I.T.S  anime is a prequel. It takes place before the 1995 animation, 2.0, innocence, stand alone complex, s.a.c second gig, and solid state society. If you love Major Motoko Kusanagi and the whole ghost in the shell crew, the return in a brand new younger epic way never seen before. It is very intelligent, it surprised me. I thought nothing could compare to the intelligent stand alone complex series. This is still a super science fiction adventure. I thought this was going to be episodes like s.a.c and second gig, but they are actually OVA's almost an hour long a piece. I cannot wait to see where they are going to go with this. I like this, it feels like watch an entire anime movie, it is intense. I highly recommend this even if your not a G.I.T.S fan. Also Chris Sabat is Batou, how cool is that. Not David Kaye, but good.  does not voice Mary Elizabeth McGlynn does not voice Motoko, but still voices a character Kurutsu  in the OVA.

6510133,3,B00LXGN2L4,"Ok just finished ""Ghost Pain"" the first disc in this bundle.  Just viewed it once ... but ... visuals: compared to the original GITS this one is a step or two behind.  Look at the alley, building walls when Motoku views the crime scene.  Lacks the grim, the dirty look of a real alley.  The sky(s)/city looks ... just ... painted.
Where is the airliner flying overhead while the city bustles? (of course that original was Hong Kong) Where are the raindrops hitting the water/falling reflected/illuminated by the city night lights?
I'm not asking them to redo these ... but where are the ""signature"" scenes that catches your eye and makes this a memorable anime?
This is  new GITS and I am happy that we now have new and original material.  It's just that once you've seen the original ... you at least want the same level of visuals or maybe, just maybe ... even better ...

GITS when it first came out - back in 97 ... it was f_____g amazing!  There was nothing like it before ... nothing!  (Still might have the VHS tape stored ... somewhere ...(?))

So now Arise ... 17 years later ... why couldn't they at least do ""as good"" visuals?",1417824000,4,1137,4.449275362318841

Only question I have is why is Borders 1&2 as a bluray box set way cheaper than the individual purchases of 3 or 4? Yes they are probrably packed with ""extras"" but my geekiness isn't that deep lol.

Its definately worth the money spent as the anime and story are top notch. It definately isn't a purchase for a child either. Peace",1415836800,2,550,4.392156862745098
6510136,5,B00LXGN2L4,"A very nice return to the Ghost In The Shell! Although there are a few things that raised some questions for me (Such as, how much of the main character's background are they changing, if any), overall this set delivers the goods. My main grip with the way this was done doesn't have anything to do with the content, but the way it's presented to us. Instead of a DVD set and a Blu-ray set you HAVE to buy a combo set! This means paying extra for this set when, if it was available in either Blu-ray or DVD editions, you could chose what you wanted without being forced to get both!! (I think Blu-ray is great but not at the prices they want to charge!!) I usually get DVDs instead and that works for me. Aside from that, this set works for me. I noted that some have expressed concern over the new voice actor used for Moto. I found no problem at all with this and could see how a younger Moto would sound this way. Another thing that's great from my point of view is the way you see that Moto is still ""learning"" in this series. She's not the well seasoned pro here but, even though she has the training, hasn't learned to completely use it all. She can even be fooled! This is perfect for a series that wants to show how things came to be the way they were later. You have a Moto who isn't even 100% sure about her pass and is just beginning to form her team.  It's all very well presented here.  Other than the combo issue, my only other thing was let's not throw out these character's pass backgrounds to easily as I noted this seemed to implied from the first two OVAs. This seems to be a real problem with things that are redone now-a-days. I hope it doesn't infect that series also.  Great Job and well worth the money!",1414540800,10,1727,4.195783132530121
6510137,5,B00LXGN2L4,"By a stroke of luck I managed to find this in a Best Buy store before the official release date, so I actually have this product in hand.  One of the things I like most about the actual product, and not just the films themselves is that the box has a reflective glow that really makes it stand out.  Plus, each Blu-Ray case has a detailed guide inside that is packed with fun facts.  On top of all that each cover is reversible showing a image of Tokyo on the inside of each cover.  Volume one's inside cover is red and volume two's cover is green.

Most people know what to expect from a Ghost In The Shell series, but for those who don't these OVA's have some sweet action scenes and a very enjoyable sci-fi military story that doesn't leave you with just mindless action.  I understand that some people don't like the fact that this series has new voice actors, but that doesn't bother me, and isn't a big deal.  The bottom line is that Ghost In The Shell is just as good as it always been, and deserves your time.
