The packaging on this is very nice and the book inside is nice looking (albeit a bit smaller then i had thought) but they had to make it fit in the package so no biggie. overall i really look forward to giving this to my son.",1381795200,2,380,4.0131578947368425
5895550,5,B00E8G5H0K,"I won't talk about the actual show because I imagine most people reading this already know that the Clone Wars is Star Wars done right. However, what I think bears mentioning is that Lucasfilm really created a great collector's edition here. First, the packaging is wonderful and really manages to incorporate many of the characters from the show. Second, the Art of the Clone Wars book is a wonderful look at the series and something we'd been clamoring for since the The Art of Star Wars: The Clone Wars was first released. The included episode guide should also help fans who want to watch episodes in chronological order and not the order in which the episodes were aired. Finally, I applaud the pricing - this set is very cheap for 5 seasons of television. Definitely recommended.",1381104000,32,785,4.779411764705882
5895551,5,B00E8G5H0K,"First off... I love this this show.
I have enjoy every single episode. Each story was just so well done.
While I am a little sad to see this series end, I am excited for the new Star Wars Rebels that is coming out soon.
I am hoping that the ""canceled"" sixth season or the last few episodes that they had planned will come out soon in its own set. Don't release this set again just with that thrown in. Unless it is already included.

Overall impression (pre-release) this set is going to be awesome.
Cannot wait for OCT. 15 to get here.",1380931200,2,536,4.203883495145631
5895552,4,B00E8G5H0K,"I love the show. Its absolutely amazing. It starts off a bit slower, but the show really grows and matures along with its viewers. Can't wait for the season 6 content to become available. I just hate the fact that companies release these series box sets for so cheap with exclusive bonuses once a series ends so everyone who has bought them as they came out are screwed for their loyalty. Now I am gonna have to find someone or somewhere to buy my seasons 1-4 for around $60 because spending $42 for the final season seems like I may be over paying for less extras.

Though I am just complaining. This is definitely a great value.",1379894400,3,630,4.384615384615385

5895555,3,B00E8G5H0K,"i have no idea why the animation has so high reviews seeing that there are a lot of inconsistencies with the canon and also that the episodes are in no order whatsoever, the first episode is the 3rd of a serie who starts in season 4 ??? and indeed a lot of season 4 episodes are either first ones of a serie or those between stories of the 3 first seasons. Worst case is if dead people come back due to lack of episode order .",1376697600,5,426,3.9651162790697674
5895556,5,B00E8G5H0K,"In January of 2008, a 12-year-old boy went to his friend's house to watch a movie. The popularity of Star Wars since the release of Revenge of the Sith had been on the decline and superhero movies had begun to take its place in their minds. The boy's friend showed him the movie trailer for Lucasfilm's first animated movie, Star Wars: The Clone Wars. The boy was skeptical. He was there to watch Spider-Man and was convinced that this movie wouldn't count as real Star Wars. The REAL Star Wars was in the comics books that came out each month. But his friend persisted. As the August release date got closer, the friend's bedroom began to fill up with Star Wars: The Clone Wars action figures and Star Wars: The Clone Wars visual guides. The boy's friend even made plans for the two of them to see the movie on opening day. When the boy made camping plans with his family, his friend managed to get pre-release screening tickets so they wouldn't have to delay seeing the movie. Although it seemed an awful lot of effort to put towards seeing a Star Wars spin-off, they went to see the movie all the same.

They both came out of the movie astonished. They spent the whole ride home telling their parents why the movie was better than I, II, and even III. This feeling may have worn off eventually but what didn't is what the movie stood for. The prequel films, as flawed as they were, had the unmistakable ""Star Wars DNA"" in them that could captivate kids no matter how confused they were. But as hard as the music tried to say otherwise, those movies lacked the life of the originals. The machine had worked so fast that there was no time to bring the same kind of fun that captivated audiences all over the world in the late '70s and 80s.

These two boys were both hooked on the idea of The Clone Wars and that it would be continued in a weekly television series that was starting in the fall. 22 minutes of new Star Wars! Every week! The Clone Wars movie may have had limited success but it succeeded in showing that there were some serious filmmakers out there who still loved and cared about Star Wars enough to bring those stories to the screen. Although the 12-year-old boy's opinion of The Clone Wars movie faded over the years, his opinion of the series never did.

6 years later and I am 18 years old and prouder than ever to call myself a Star Wars fan. The news of Episode VII has created a buzz in the air that I never thought would exist again. But what really saved Star Wars was the spirit of the animated series that had its five-year run on Cartoon Network and reminded its fans what Star Wars really is. Although this review has very little to do with content, I can guarantee that talking about its contents would only spoil the experience.

You can choose your favorite and least favorite stories along the way but what's so incredible is that we now have enough Star Wars to be able to compare like that. The money is a small price to pay considering the hours of pure entertainment that's in store for whoever purchases this gem of a television series. So all fans - of the originals, of the prequels, or of both - strap yourselves in and get ready for the best Star Wars since 1980. These ARE the discs you've been looking for!",1376265600,88,3251,4.3864013266998345

5895565,5,B00E8G5H0K,"First, I'll start this review with the very few things that I was dissatisfied with pertaining to this dvd set. The design of the cases is, for lack of a better term, stupid. The main box that the cases and books come in has no way to fasten closed whether by magnet, flap, etc. You close the lid and it just lays there. The design of the plastic cases is goofy as well. You kind of have to close them in a crooked way for them to snap closed. They are not your typical dvd cases. Also, a very minor thing, some of the voice actors for supporting characters are inconsistent. For example, for the first handful of episodes in season one, Ahmed Best (actor who played Jar Jar in the movies) plays Jar Jar but then they switch voice actors for a few episodes and then switch to a third voice actor later on. Main roles are consistent however.

Having said all of that.. I love this show. It takes place during The Clone Wars which happened during the three years separating Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. This is not your typical ""kids cartoon."" This cartoon, much like the movies, is family friendly but seems to be geared more towards older kids/teens/adults. There is no ""dumbed down"" terminology or anything like that, characters speak in this show the same as they do in the movies with regards to the Senate and things like that that maybe younger kids wouldn't be able to fully understand. The animation is very clean and looks great. I personally was skeptical of the animation because I don't really care for the ""CGI"" 3-D type animation style. I like the more 2-D animation style of the older cartoons but I was pleasantly surprised when watching this show. It's great and in my opinion if it were animated in the 2-D style it would probably not be anywhere near as good as it is. All in all, for any Star Wars fan who loves the movies like I do or anyone who is looking for more in depth Star Wars lore, this is a purchase I definitely recommend. This show follows the Star Wars ""canon"" so it is all in line with the storylines from the movies and everything lines up so you are watching events that happened in the official Star Wars storyline, nothing ""fictional"" if you will. Definite 5 stars, very well executed.",1487462400,,2240,4.423728813559322

It was pretty good, a lot of cheesyness which seemed unprofessional as well as silly moral lessons, but it was fun and funny nonetheless. The part that bothered me though was the final 2 episodes. The whole fifth season was awesome except for the concluded two episodes of all the seasons. They SUCKED! Completely ruined the whole series.

I can tell because sometimes when you watch the 'last time on CloneWars' portion, it matches up with the last episode we saw perfectly, but most of the time - I have *no* clue what I'm looking at in those clips that are supposed to bring you up to speed.  But of course, my 6 year old barely notices, and certainly doesn't care, so... eh, it suits my purposes.  But I figured I'd note that for y'all.",1453420800,4,898,4.216374269005848

It was originally planned for young audiences, but takes an adult, dark, grim turn after season 2. Well worth watching, incredible storyline, perfect for the older, intellectual Star Wars fan and a young appreciator alike.

The series introduces ethical dilemmas, military philosophy, the psychological cost of warfare, as well as the humanity of the clones as they face an internal struggle for personal identity only tempered by their loyalty to their brothers.

In addition, the storyline is superb and the round characters are something that all audiences can appreciate.

5895612,5,B00E8G5H0K,"I love this. This is by far one of my favorite shows. Way better than that piece of crap Star Wars Rebels. I just hate that the clone wars was cancelled.

Story: 10/10. Complete opposite of campy. Each episode is on a different planet, different environment, with different characters. The stories aren't all that kid friendly, which is why I LOVE IT. Much darker toned than even revenge of the sith at times.

Characters: 11/10. More characters than you can count. Get to know all the characters who got about 5 seconds of screen time in the main movies. Plo Koon, Kit Fisto (who has a Jamaican accent which i find humorous), Luminara, Shaak Ti, and many more. You also get to know the clones in their individual legions, like rex, and cody, and many other clones who you get attached to. Get to know the villians. Dooku, grievous, ventress. See darth maul rise again and cause galactic chaos.

Animation: 10/10. The animation wasn't the best in the 1st season, but by the fourth season it had better graphics than any show at the time. Special effects are beautiful, with emphasis on blue glows. Better than the movies tbh.

Voice Acting: 10/10. I could go on about the amazing performances by all the voice actors but that'd take forever. Take my word for it.

Action: 10/10. Better action scenes than the movies. Lightsaber duels can be brief at times but i savor every moment. And they aren't afraid to kill off characters. Seriously more main characters die than in game of thrones. Which again is why I LOVE IT.

Though the clone wars is over all the stories live on. This set is the perfect way to ensure that. Btw this does not include season 6, that is sold separately. You have to buy this.",1442016000,2,1701,4.560655737704918

Seriously, if you're a fan of Star Wars and you haven't seen this yet you need to.

At first the art style turned me off but after a while it grew on me. The story is usually pretty straight forward, simple lessons to be learned, etc, etc. However it's the character development that really steals the show.

Honestly, love or hate the prequels this show provide more story and character development than all of them (maybe even rivaling the OT (*gasp* did he just say that?!)).

Plus, you figure ""well I've seen all the movies and this takes place between movies 2 and 3 so I can pretty much figure it out"" yea, or not.

Some of the stuff is obvious and broadcast from pretty far off, other stuff creeps up and smacks you in the face.

One thing though, this doesn't include the ""lost missions"" which is essentially a series of wrap up episodes (which gives you the vibe this show could have easily run for another 2-3 seasons before starting to get stale) so do yourself a favor and fin those (currently available on Netflix) and watch them as well.

Also, these aren't all technically in chronological order. If that throws you off then here's a list of the order you're going to want to watch them in
( http://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-the-clone-wars-chronological-episodeorder )

Bottom line, yes you can get all of this on Netflix (for now) but, as a fan, I just had to have this collection. Well worth the price (when I got it anyway)",1432166400,3,1544,4.6300366300366305

5895636,5,B00E8G5H0K,"EXCELLENT series! Be advised that Season 6 (""The Lost Missions"") and the movie that kicked off the series has to be purchased separately.

Ever wondered what it would be like seeing Luke's Father and Ben Kenobi swashbuckling in the Clone Wars? Time to sate that curiosity.

Though this was on cartoon network and was made for kids, it is the most ADULT kid show I have ever seen. To clarify, the first half of season 1 has a lot of kiddy stuff, as is expected, but the series gets dark and matures greatly and rapidly. So much so that by the beginning of season 3 the viewer will question if this is still a kid's show.

If you are hesitant to make purchase of this, go look on your shelf for the Star Wars movies 1 - 6. If they are there then treat this series like the movies and BUY IT. If Episodes 1 - 6 are not on your shelf, why?

Note: Watch this series before watching the current series ""Star Wars: Rebels"", if I say why I will spoil things. However I can say this, ""Rebels"" matured within season 1, and season 2 is going to rock!",1431129600,2,1039,4.18

5895644,5,B00E8G5H0K,"The clone wars series does a great job of fleshing out the time between Episodes II and III. It also provides a lot of great character development, and makes Anakin's fall to the dark side more understandable.

The show does a great job of showing character relationships, and expanding lines from the movie. It's really recommended to watch Episode III right after watching through the Clone Wars series. Just watching the movies, we're told that Anakin and Obi Wan are really close, but the cartoon shows it, we get to see a lot of the moments where they save each others lives and such. (I'd say more about making Anakin's fall to the darkside more understandable, but that'd involve major spoilers.)

Also, we get one of the best characters in the saga introduced here. I seriously think that people that don't like Ahsoka only saw the intro movie and jumped to conclusions without seeing the rest of the series. She's probably my third favorite (cannon) character.

My only gripe is the violence level. It's nothing for adults, but a bit much for small children. (It's about the same as Episode's III and V.)",1428278400,2,1113,4.756476683937824

Thankfully I was proven wrong and was treated to some of the very best stories that star wars has to offer. At times I wish they could go back to the prequels and re do them with this type of writing. The animation continually improves throughout the seasons and the themes become darker and darker. But the fact that the stories become darker is not what made this show great, it was the writing. The breakout character for this show is anakins apprentice Ahsoka Tano. She started as someone that I was comvinced would be killed off or would be very annoying. Thankfully she proved to be a very strong and capable character that hopefully we will see again.

Even though Anakin's a Master in this series, with a padawan no less, (in Episode III ROTS Anakin wasn't even a Master yet and I quess never became one before he turned darkside) I just choose to ignore that little part of ROTS and play along with Anakin being the best Jedi in the galaxy, and a Master, not some whiney little moody brat as portrayed in the films. Here in ""The Clone Wars"" Anakin shows his dark sense of morality, yet uses the strengths of his passions (not good for a Jedi) to really show his power in fighting all that oppose him. His fear of losing his padawan to injury or death during battles shows how he still fears to lose in life, (bad for a Jedi) a trait that eventually turns him into Darth Vader later on. Great action set pieces, light-sabre battles too fast for the eye, plot turns, and fantastic Jedi action more than make up for the scattershot continuity issues and the opening 30 seconds of each episode with that newsreel narrator who makes the audience feel like they missed the last episode since they are all new scenes depicted. Like a real war this story is told in snippets of story rather than one act leading directly to another, but for some they might feel confused. Still 5 stars, just for the fact Anakin Skywalker isn't a brat, but a fully grown man who's Jedi skills are at their peak, even though those strengths eventually led to him losing his soul in the end.

5895708,5,B00E8G5H0K,"I was a bit iffy about this series at first because I thought it would be too kiddy and it would have that ""jar jar binks"" kind of quality to it - WRONG!  This series does just appeal to children.  It appeals to Star Wars lovers of all ages and I personally think it is better than the last 3 movies that came out.  You get a chance to really know the characters and the show also introduces some new favorite characters: Ahsoka Tano and Captain Rex.  And while I thought that Ahoska would be the character I would hate the most because she would be the ""kiddy"" character, nope.  There is some great character development with her and her presence leads to some great character development with Anikan.  Captain Rex is also a great character - wait till you get to the Krell arc.  And let's not leave off that Dave Filoni is one of the primary director's on this one and if your a fan of Avatar the Last Airbender, yea he worked on that too.  I would definitely recommend purchasing the discs for this rather than watching them on a popular tv service, because you get the commentary by Dave Filoni, Katie Lucas, and others which is really enjoyable if you love the show.  In summary, yes I had my reservations but I was proved wrong by a great show with great writing and directing :)",1400630400,,1285,4.343096234309623

As cartoons (short cartoon episodes - perfect for a 3-year-old attention span), they keep her interest.  There is also enough humor from the droids and different characters that she totally buys into it and now asks to watch Star Wars!  As the adult, I've enjoyed seeing some of the characters we don't see as much in the movies, and following the ongoing plot (and knowing how it plays into the storyline from Episodes 1-6.  I have been impressed at how well is stays true to ""Star Wars"".  I was worried it would be too ""kid-ified"", but they kept it as what you'd expect from Star Wars.  Awesome buy!

Star Wars The Clone Wars may come off as that kids show shown later in the afternoon on Cartoon Network, but it is much, much more than that. The Clone Wars shows you what went on between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. This show is action packed and epic. Can be brutal at times. Overall a really great show.

 I always wanted to own the seasons of The Clone Wars but never got around to actually buying them. Then the show got canceled and I was disappointed to say the least. After months of adding the seasons to my wish list to eventually buy, I cam across this. This seemed like a much better solution. Plus, this came with a small art book which is really cool.

Ultimately you'll be forced to call Warner Bros to get replacement discs, as they've apparently printed up discs for Season 5 that actually work.

As a hardcore Star Wars fan, I have to say, from the heart, that this show is true Star Wars. It never feels like it is watered down into 30 minute episodes, never feels like a kids show, and maintains the things that make Star Wars great. Overall, I would say that the show is designed to be a collection of stories about the Clone Wars, intended to showcase the diversity of events that occurred in this galaxy during that time. There is an episode devoted to pretty much any worthwhile character from this time, and they are all worth watching. Since Lucasarts is no more, this show has been effectively cancelled, but there will be a number of ""conclusion episodes"" airing in mid 2014, which I definitely look forward to.",1391731200,7,931,4.35632183908046

5895776,5,B00E8G5H0K,"Until I pre-ordered Star Wars; The Clone Wars, I had never seen a single episode of it.  Despite being a fan of the franchise since i was two-years old in 1977, it was something I just never got around to and I didn't appreciate how a prime time series on Cartoon Network revolving around Star Wars would be anything but geared towards little kids.

Boy was I mistaken...

Star Wars: The Clone Wars is the best animated action series in the history of television, hands-down, and this Blu-ray release of the complete series is a triumph both visually and audio-wise.

Contrary to my misgivings, the series is definitely not geared towards younger kids.  It's dark, it's heavy and there's plenty of good guys and bad guys getting killed (sometimes graphically) to make the PTC have kittens.  The series is incredibly well-written and weaves seamlessly into the Star Wars mythology and honestly, it adds more depth to the franchise than ANY of the films ever have.  This is not to criticize the films, but they were all pretty straightforward as far morality plays are concerned.  Good vs. evil, black and white... that's about it... oh, and of course Muppets (nub, nub).  Of course, the supporting novels, comic book series, etc., add much more to the universe, but on-screen it's been pretty basic.  Star Wars: The Clone Wars has so many different levels of ambiguity and shades of gray that you can't help to find yourself wrapped up in the introspective nature of the narrative, questioning your own preconceived notions of right and wrong.

The CGI is so crisp and detailed on both the planetside landscapes and the exterior in-space battle scenes that I find myself forgetting that I'm watching an animated series.

The audio mix is also a surprisingly well-done Dolby Digital 5.1 for the first two seasons.  I say surprisingly well-done because as anyone with a decent home theater can attest to, there is a vast difference in audio quality between the compressed Dolby Digital/DTS codecs and the lossless Dolby True HD/DTS HD MA codecs.  The Dolby mix is surprising rich and full with booming sound effects during battle scenes and feature film quality scores in both composition and presentation.  I haven't yet gotten to season three yet to judge the lossless DTS HD MA audio tracks but I can only imagine that if they put that much effort into the Dolby Digital mixes, the HD mixes must be as equally outstanding.

As far as the bonus features are concerned, there is a good amount of interesting content revolving around the behind-the-scenes production and the creative process.  It's thoroughly enjoyable.  The set comes with a neat little hard-bound book that features the concept art of the series as well.

Overall, this series and the presentation on Blu-ray is a treat and you cannot beat the pricepoint, even if you paid full MSRP considering that the individual seasons are $60 each. I pre-ordered and paid $105, less than the cost of two seasons.

NOTE: In the 1-star ratings, there seems to be a trend of some people having issues with season five.  I can't comment on that as I haven't gotten that far but will if I encounter similar issues.

I have close to 400 Blu-ray titles, some good, some bad but Star Wars: The Clone Wars is by far one of the best I own and I would highly recommend it to anyone, even if you're not a fan of the franchise.",1387756800,2,3368,4.75085910652921

5895786,3,B00E8G5H0K,"I ""upgraded"" to this box set from the individual seasons and am a bit disappointed. The hardcover artbook included with this set is roughly the same number of pages (and same size pages) as each of the art booklets that were included in the Season 1 and Season 2 digibooks. So if you had both digibooks, as I did, you already have twice as much artwork as is included in this entire collectors edition. So that begs the question - did the design of this collectors edition play a role in the discontinuation of those digibooks after Season 2? Did they realize the digibooks were outdoing themselves and might trivialize this collectors edition? Whether or not that's the case, one cannot help but wonder - nor help but be dismayed by the mediocrity of this set.

On the upside, the heavily embossed chipboard artbox that this comes in, which admittedly is where the large portion of the manufacturing costs lie, is magnificently done. Truly beautiful. But by skimping so badly on content inside I can't shake the feeling of style over substance.

Because of this I will need to look for other cases that fit this set because I cannot even put the cases back together. Very disappointed in the packaging.

I checked for the issues that others have had regarding season 5 and I see no syncing issues so that is good. The quality of the DVD's themselves are great...again...my only issue is with the packaging.",1386720000,,677,4.416

5895790,5,B00E8G5H0K,"As far as TV series box sets go, this has to be one of the best put-together sets I have seen. The packaging is phenomenal, the exclusive art book is great incentive, and that isn't even grazing the surface of the show itself, which won an Emmy for its fifth and final season. A must-have for even a casual Star Wars fan.

One thing I cannot stomach is all of the reviews dissing the series for not being canonical, or according to the Star Wars that George Lucas originally envisioned. Nothing could be further from the truth. If you did your research, you would see that George Lucas himself personally coached Dave Filoni on his way of doing things, and in addition, approved every single story that ever came out of the writers' meetings. He even attended most of them, and his daughter Katie wrote many of the episodes from Season Three onward. George Lucas couldn't have been closer to this series if he had directed the episodes himself.

Continuing the review about this particular release and not the series in general, I believe I would have enjoyed it immensely more if the discs included were not simply re-burns of the Blu-Rays from the individual releases. It is essentially placing new stickers on the same discs and placing them in a new box. As I had not previously owned the Blu-Ray releases, it is not a complaint on my part, but I know that this could be a deal breaker for some. Also, I mourn the decision to not wait until the final episodes (what the production team labels ""Bonus Content"") are released to make it a true complete series set. A disc of never-before released special features would have been appreciated as well.

Despite these very small misgivings, I can't give higher praise for the series as a whole, and as this is the only collection of all five seasons thus far, I am more than happy to pay the 100+ dollars for this essential piece of Star Wars lore.",1385856000,4,1897,4.557184750733138

I was willing to let the audio and formatting thing slide, they are relatively minor, but the fact Season 5 doesn't function at all pushed me over the edge. I would not advise purchasing this product until Amazon/Warner Bros get their issues sorted out.

I really enjoy the special features too.  Not often do you get deleted scenes with animated features because of the sheer amount of man hours it takes to complete every frame.  So they're blocky pre-vis, barely animated scenes.  But it's still nice to see some of the extra plot points and directions it was going.  I really like the 3-D turnarounds.  I just wish I could control what I was seeing.  It's basically just a video of whatever character walking as the camera pans around them once.  Control of the camera or having it loop until I tell it to advance would have been better.

The only Con I can come up with is the actual plastic cases the DVDs are in.  It's packaged as Seasons 1-3 then 4-5.  I would have preferred each season packaged separately.  Then I wouldn't have to take out 2 seasons and flip through all the discs just to get to one season I'm after.  That's the only reason I would take off 1/2 a star.

5895810,5,B00E8G5H0K,"I'm a Star Wars fan. However, I purchased this set without having watched the series beforehand. After reading comments about BD-discs not working properly, I briefly tested all seasons 4-5 discs by playing the first 10-20 minutes, with different languages and subtitles. I found no problems at all with my Sony Blu-ray 3D player. I have now watched the first two discs of season 1 without incidents. I expect the rest of the set to play properly but I'd keep an eye for the issues other people are experiencing.

The hardcover box is very attractive, with a metallic finish and textured characters. The extras (graphic art and episode guide) are nice but not very impressive, at least not for a collector's edition. I think the set offers a great value (price-wise) when compared to the individual season sets. The animation and sound are outstanding and the episodes entertaining. The series appears to mature and improve progressively.

For those interested in languages, the discs offer a variety of both sound and subtitles: English, French, German, 2-Spanish options (Spain and Latin America). This is a welcome addition for those who need or want alternatives while watching. Although my first language is Spanish, I prefer watching in English as the voices of the actors somewhat resemble those of the actors in the movies.",1382486400,36,1331,5.045454545454546

I had not watched the series and have been enjoying catching up with the box set.  I've been using one of the many chronological guides to watch the series in order and, so far, it has made for a very entertaining and cohesive story.  Well worth watching.

I'm a little disappointed in the number of bad reviews that are railing against either the cancellation or presumption that this set is ""incomplete"" rather than discussing the actual content of this set.  The content (story, art-style, packaging) is fantastic and the price is very reasonable for the over 40 hours of content.  As for those waiting for the unfinished Season 6 episode release, it is (unfortunately) unlikely that they will be packaged in a final collector's set given the Disney/Warner Bros relationship that resulted in the cancellation.",1382313600,3,979,5.043478260869565
5895815,5,B00E8G5H0K,"I've bought almost every episode of The Clone Wars on iTunes and watched them several times, and I'm still glad I decided to get the complete series box set. I haven't watched everything in this set yet, but I've watched several episodes and bonus features from multiple seasons, and so far I'm 100% satisfied with my purchase. It's a great price for all five seasons, and includes deleted scenes, featurettes, and other bonus materials that you won't find on starwars.com, Cartoon Network, or anywhere else. In addition, the episodes on blu-ray look great, sound great, and are presented in full anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1 aspect ratio). They air on TV in 1.85:1, so you're seeing the whole picture on blu-ray that they had to crop slightly for TV. There are also director's cut episodes that contain scenes that Cartoon Network censored in the original airing, so a few of the episodes are a bit more intense than you may remember, which older fans like myself may find enjoyable.

The set comes nicely-packaged in a great-looking box, with a handy booklet that lays out which episodes and bonus features are on each disc. It also comes with an all-new book of concept art that has some very neat stuff in it. The only criticism I can think of is that Season 4 is a bit lacking in special features compared to the other seasons. Also, if you already own multiple separate seasons of the show on blu-ray, this complete set doesn't bring anything new to the table except for the packaging and the art book, which is nice but not worth $105 by itself.

If you're a fan of The Clone Wars, and even if you've already watched every episode multiple times like I have, this is one of the best blu-ray purchases you'll ever make. The show itself was already amazing, but with the fantastic blu-ray picture and sound quality, the nice collector's edition packaging, and the wealth of extra content, this is a must-have addition to your Star Wars collection.",1382227200,20,1953,4.741176470588235

I just felt that if you are interested in this set that you should know more about the box. It is a beautiful box with a magnetic clasp. The art book contained inside is great and has art that is different from the art contained in the individual season box sets. The faces of the discs themselves are also different than what you get in the individual season sets. The episode listing book also is laid out very nicely. For the price listed on Amazon this set is a MUST buy for real Star Wars fans. It is true that season 6 is not included with this set and at this time, details are not available on how the extra content will be released. Star Wars has repackaged its movies more than any series I know of, so use your discretion on whether or not you feel like the extra content will be added at a later date (to another as yet unannounced set).

5895817,4,B00E8G5H0K,"As someone who owned the first 4 seasons on DVD I can absolutely say that the switch to blu ray for this complete 5 season series set is well worth it.  It comes with a nice (if not great) art book, plus a separate booklet detailing each episode.  The picture and sound quality for both the episodes and the extras is superb, and a definite step up from my old DVDs.  For those of you who haven't watched the series yet, this is the box to get I think.

The series finale (which I will not spoil here) was a rather clever ending that DID at least answer the biggest question of all - why wasn't Anakin's new padawn not in the movies?  The series also ends in a way that absolutely informs Anakin's perspective and who he is at the beginning of Revenge of the Sith.  For me, that's 99% of why I love this box set, because even though the show was abruptly cancelled, they did at least answer that one rather large question. Overall, the chronology stays intact and actually enhances the movies greatly in my opinion.

 ...To be fair though, there are two or three story threads that I wish would have been wrapped up, but Lucasfilm is supposed to be releasing a few more episodes next year which may (or may not) answer the remaining questions.  But speaking soley for this set I believe it (more or less) does tell a complete tale, and contains many of the absolute best Star Wars stories ever told.  And that's saying something.

8602503,5,B00E8G5H0K,"Magnificent companion series to Star Wars films 1 , 2 and 3. It helps fill out the story of the Clone War and the eventual failure of the Republic , told from a variety of different perspectives including some surprising ones. The addition of Anakins own Padawan is  a new and fascinating character , She fights with a light saber and what appears to be a light dagger as well...pretty damned cool , i always wondered if there weren't things like a light dagger or light pocket knife. . There are elements to this whole plot line that make no sense but im not too worked up over them as this  set of all 5 seasons is a must have for any SW fan.",1518652800,,644,4.185483870967742
