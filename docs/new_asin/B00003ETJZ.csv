1328328,5,B00003ETJZ,"Rania of Long Beach has long wanted to set a standard for herself and other women in using bellydance as an art and as a way of fitness. As a CERTIFIED aerobic instructor, she took her time to put this video together.
She accentuates and breaks down ALL parts of the body in a comfortable setting, along with 2 background dancers that follows along just as easy. The exercising is LOW-impact, allowing one who buys this to variate to their own enjoyed pace.
She has some of the best abdominals in bellydance today, and her segment on the area (especially belly rolls) will be a hit with beginning bellydancers, exercise buffs and video collectors alike.
The ending routine that ... all movements taught is well-scripted and designed to read and watch along. Rania's physique is a statement in today;s society: the thicker, the better. You don;t have to be as muscular as her to gain benefits from this workout. If you go at your own pace, you should see benefits. After all, the benefits by looking at her is motivation enough. And, she has more coming set to other forms of music. A MUST for women learning to bellydance.",1034553600,18,1122,4.64321608040201

1328339,2,B00003ETJZ,Something about  the look on this chicks face is annoying and I don't wan't to do the workout. Also...it seems like all the girls are on a different pace so when the the video focuses on a different girl...it makes you feel like your either moving too fast or slow. This video is okay...but I wouldn't  purchase it.,1431820800,,315,4.413793103448276

1328346,2,B00003ETJZ,"I bought this thinking it would be good exercise and fun, but it's hard for me to do some of the moves, and hard to keep up. So, instead if is discouraging, and I don't do it.",1403136000,,175,3.7567567567567566
1328347,2,B00003ETJZ,"This DVD is okay for beginners--the moves are easy and taught slowly.  If you have belly dance experience, are looking for a good cardio workout, or to learn proper belly dance technique, then this DVD isn't for you.  It was so boring I had to break it up into three separate sessions (even though it's only 36 minutes long)--I just couldn't stick with this one.",1402617600,,362,4.553846153846154

1328359,5,B00003ETJZ,I ordered this DVD to replace the VHS I already had. I was very pleased with this purchase because there is an additional workout that was not included on the VHS. A fun intro to belly dancing that will work up a good sweat.,1395792000,,224,4.113636363636363
1328360,4,B00003ETJZ,"I also like each DVDs bonus workouts that target different areas. From Cardio Shimmy to Pure Sweat, these dance workouts are fun and sometimes a little flirty, but if you're having fun while working out, all the better.",1392768000,,219,4.7894736842105265
1328361,5,B00003ETJZ,"I rewind it and play it twice. It is a great workout for me. I have fibromyalgia and bellydance keeps me from feeling so stiff and in pain. I also take classes at the y from an experienced instructor, but this is good to keep me loose and fit between classes.",1389398400,,259,4.098039215686274
1328362,2,B00003ETJZ,"I watched this DVD with my friend and here's the consensus:

The Good:  Decent cardio--hard to keep up with!  A bonus workout and two bonus performances.  (The first one we didn't chat through, the second, meh.)  Nice and short workout for the busy gal.  (30 minutes).

The Bad:  The music is just terrible--more Caribbean than anything.  If you are new to belly dance, you might get confused on the moves which are very fast, but also SUPER REPETITIVE--so you may be able to catch on after all!  This DVD likely has a negative effect on anyone's technique--Rania and the backup dancers have much to be desired.  Overall, this is a challenging workout--in fact, it could have benefited from having one of the back-up dancers doing a modified routine for those of us having trouble keeping up!",1384300800,,792,4.75
1328363,5,B00003ETJZ,"I bought each of these DVDs separately but wanted to post the review for all of them here.

I have low back problems, mostly because of a weak core - Bellydance Boogie is perfect for that, plus, with all the snake-arms, the upper back flab that's so hard to get rid off, is slowly melting off!
HipDropHipHop is great for getting moving in the morning- although my 'scoop'n'drop' probably isn't graceful when I do it at 530!
Cardio Shimmy and Pure Sweat are just what they say they are - you get sweaty!  Really - when I first got it, I thought - moving my legs like that is a work-out?  It is!  And Rania keeps you going and before you know it - thirty minutes have gone by and you're done.
I do one of these Monday, Wednesday and Friday, plus both days on the weekends.  Sometimes on the weekend I'll do two a day.  They're fun and easy to do.  And seeing results after three weeks is incentive for me to keep going.",1382313600,2,917,4.2057142857142855

The editing for her videos is not great, but she explains the dance moves well and gives you plenty of repetitions to get good at each combo before putting them all together. The most important thing I like about her videos is that I ALWAYS SWEAT! Definitely what I am looking for in a cardio dance  DVD.",1372896000,,526,4.36734693877551
1328366,5,B00003ETJZ,"This arrived in good shape and it is super fun. I don't like working out, but with this I can't wait for my next workout. I am already seeing major changes and I have only been doing it for 3 weeks!",1362528000,,198,3.8536585365853657

1328369,5,B00003ETJZ,I love her videos.  There  is no guessing around.  She teaches you the move. You master it. Then the fat falls off your tush. Voila! Isn't that what we want. The fact that she repeats a routine allows the viewer to add their own movements if they wish.  Great stretches.  It's an awesome workout.,1360281600,,296,4.407407407407407
1328370,5,B00003ETJZ,"This work out is specifically designed at keeping your hips and sides in constant movement to tone and strengthen those body parts. If a beginner, you will feel the burn. If not, you will just have a good time!",1333843200,,210,4.410256410256411
1328371,5,B00003ETJZ,"Rania has another Belly dance DVD for Fitness and Beginners to the art called Pure Sweat. In my option, this work out make me sweat far more than that one. Great leg work out, that's for sure!",1333843200,,192,4.216216216216216

1328373,1,B00003ETJZ,"When I was a new bellydancer, I was always looking for new options to help me practice at home between classes.  I tried Veena and Neena, and although I've seen some pretty crappy reviews of their videos, I liked them.  I got a little over-excited, and wanted to learn more... so instead of trying out ONE video by Rania, I bought the whole set.  Cardio Shimmy made me sweat at least, but the other videos are absolutely boring.  I felt like I was ""learning"" the grapevine for about 3 hours, even though the videos are only 30 minutes.  Apparently not everyone is as turned off by Rania's dancing as I am, but I can barely stand to look at her.  She looks like a male trucker (with pretty hair and fake boobs) trying to dance.  The grimaces, stiffness, lack of grace... and the creepy voice... I don't even feel like a nice person putting them on eBay because I love bellydance and don't want any newcomers thinking that what she's doing is what it should look like.  In my opinion, videos by Suhaila Salimpour and Jillina are much better options... or better yet, find a good instructor in your area, so that you can learn to execute the movements safely and correctly.",1287878400,3,1170,4.485849056603773
1328374,5,B00003ETJZ,"I got this multiple volume cd from Rania because I had purchased the Hip Hop,Hip Drop three years ago and loved it. It was easy to follow along, and she takes you through the steps several times before you put it into action. Then, she shows you how to put them all together. This Hip Hop,Hip Drop is in the multi-volume set so now I am anxious to give my original one away for someone else to try.

The workouts are fluid, and you sweat a lot, but it is not strenuous. FOr those with fibromyalgia or arthritis this is easy on the joints. After a few weeks of workouts, I was losing inches off the hips and thighs. It is a very good cardio that won't kill you. I love the multi-volume cd because you have five workouts, and you can work everything in your body. This is great to get to also keep your routine fresh, by doing a different DVD everyday. I highly recommend Rania, I think out of all the bellydance DVD's I have used, she is definitely the best.",1264809600,,957,4.201086956521739
1328375,3,B00003ETJZ,"I like this video! The choreography is interesting, if not a bit too repetitive, and it is a great short workout for when I don't have a lot of time. There are a variety of dancers, tho not a variety of sizes in the 'class', and some of them are more accomplished than others #although all are obviously very familiar with the choreography#.

Now the criticism #in the spirit of being helpful#:

My greatest irritation was the fact that the voice over of the moves is not good. Often you are alerted of a change AFTER the dancers in the video have already begun the next move. A little more preparation on this are would be great.

The 'cool down' is WAY TO FAST! It felt more like a continuation of the workout! I barely had time to take a decent breath before we were moving on to the next stretch. It should have been at least twice as long as it was.

Be careful which dancers you focus on in the 'class'.  A couple of them are not moving on the beat #usually ahead#, and it can throw you off. One very pretty dark-skinned girl was my favorite; she moved very well, did not over-do the moves and was always on beat.

In general, I do NOT recommend this video to beginners. I have danced for a few years, and, for all the reasons listed above, I found it challenging #mostly in a good way#. I recommend you start with something a little more relaxed like ""The Goddess Workout"" by Dolphina. Although it is a longer workout (about 45-50 minutes), you will really get a good foundation in the basic moves.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Goddess-Workout-with-Dolphina-Introduction-to-Bellydance-VHS/dp/B00004RFSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Goddess Workout with Dolphina - Introduction to Bellydance [VHS</a>] If you want a shorter workout, I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bellydance-Fitness-for-Beginners-Boxed-Set-VHS/dp/B00002AFWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bellydance Fitness for Beginners Boxed Set [VHS</a>].

1328376,1,B00003ETJZ,"this video is chessy...if u are looking for a serious cardio aerobics, something that would help u lose weight..then this is nt for u...and in my opinion..its not even a good belly dance video, if thats what ur trying t o learn...",1249516800,,230,4.5
1328377,5,B00003ETJZ,"Well I've read some of the other reviews and I've tried all the DVD's in this set, more than once.  First, of all I want to qualify my experiences.  I'm not a dance expert, nor am I a fitness expert.  However, I did spend my youth in Gymnastics and I also spent a number of years on many dance floors dancing the night away.

Of late I've been using various Pilates DVD's which can be useful for helping to tone and isolate muscle, but is quite boring after a while, so I was more than ready to get off the floor and get these old bones moving.  Since menopause has crept up on me I'm definitely needing to get moving about and lose some unwanted weight, so Rania is a great starting point.  I'm looking forward to mastering her dance steps and finding my youthful waistline again.

One reviewer indicated this DVD was not inspiring while another said it did nothing for them and didn't teach belly dancing.  Well if you are already a dance expert this may not be what you want, however, to the one who said it didn't teach belly dancing clearly they did not listen and observe in ""class"".  Rania does a great job of showing all the steps and moves, although I do agree that more direction of exact movements would be helpful to the beginner, I was able to stop and watch, rewind and begin again as I'm sure you can too!  I found it particularly useful after practicing with two of the discs to view a couple of her belly dancing performances.  If you watch Rania perform you can see that everything she does in her performances she has already taught you in the exercise DVD's!  Be a good student and repeat and practice and you will not only learn to belly dance and possibly perform for your hubby or significant other :)) but you will also trim up that waist along with the rest of your natural curves that only a woman can have!

One other thing....even though belly dancing is not typically a 'male' thing....my 13 year old boy is doing it with me and says some of the dancing moves are just like ""Tae Bo"" and he loves it!  LOL Hey, if we can teach the guys to appreciate dancing young, then they will make better husbands, eh?  Enjoy what Rania has to offer....I am!",1244678400,4,2173,4.330864197530865
1328379,5,B00003ETJZ,"I bought the box set of Belly dance for weight loss by Rania. And I also do weightwatchers. I have lost 44.4lbs so far and at a loss of 40lbs, I had become bored with my step aerobics. A friend introduced me to belly dance so I decided to find some DVDs. I came across Rania and gave it a try. I love these workouts. I do two DVDs a day. I even labeled them by levels of difficulty. The Hip Drop Hip Hop is level 1, Belly dance Boogie is level 2, Pure Sweat is level 3 and Cardio Shimmy is level 4. So I either do the level 1 and 3 on one day. And then the alternating days I do level 2 and 4. I find that to be a good combination. Also each DVD has an extra workout, which if you saw Rania's Daily Quickies, they are each from Rania's Daily Quickies. My fave is the Waist Sculptor on the Cardio Shimmy DVD, just ten minutes and you feel it working. The workouts are great but some of the voice over and movements don't exactly match. But you get used to it and really see results. She tries to make the exercise into a routine. She also has fun with the camera with her sexy expressions. She makes me feel like although I am exercising, belly dancing is sexy. I can't wait to get where I am and do a dance for my hubby. This is a serious workout believe it or not. It is also seriously fun, enjoy!",1243987200,3,1298,3.9391634980988592

1328381,5,B00003ETJZ,"If you are just beginning to exercise this is perfect. You won't feel exhausted and overworked but you will get your blood flowing, have fun and feel good about yourself. Then, after 6 months, move up to a little more hearty workout. Alternate between the 2 workouts until you become acustom to the heartier workout. My suggestion is TurboJam where you can start out easy & work your way to a routine that is just right for you. (don't get any of the extra crap with it) Also don't forget to check out Carmen Electra's workouts. They'll make you feel sexy no matter what size you are & firm you up. Remember, when exercising, only do what you are comforatable with, then add more. Don't overwork. Ease yourself in but keep adding every few weeks.",1238803200,,746,4.533333333333333
1328382,4,B00003ETJZ,"I love these DVD's because they provide a great workout and they integrate traditional belly dance moves into modern dance.

1328383,5,B00003ETJZ,"I love these tapes. I agree with the critique that sometimes Rania looks ""vacant,"" but I think that's because she is not talking and is slowing herself down to ""our"" pace. That said, these tapes are well produced and give a great workout. Before I started doing these (and I do them everyday, honestly) I weighed 151...two months later and without changing my diet or adding anything other than these tapes, I weigh 119! These are really fun for me, I feel more like I'm dancing than working out but I am getting great results. The bellydance boogie is my favorite and the cardio shimmy is quite a workout, for sure! These are great intro level videoes that will have you shimmying around your living room and slimming down in no time flat! Give them a go!",1233878400,,756,4.525547445255475

1328386,1,B00003ETJZ,waste of money it shows the same moves over and over. Not worth it I'm sure that there are better belly dancing videos out there. Also that hip hop drop is also a con,1213747200,,166,3.911764705882353
1328387,4,B00003ETJZ,"I have purchased a number of DVD's in recent years that supposedly provide full cardio bellydance workouts. Rania's videos are among the few I have found that truly sustain an aerobic pace in a dance-based workout, without the interruptions or slowdowns that happen when a lot of instruction is included. These videos also provide a good solid warm-up and cool-down.

Of course, less instruction means that the videos are more challenging for beginners. If you have experience in aerobics classes or with other forms of dance, however, you will be able to follow the basic movements, adding in more of the nuances each time you do the workout.

In these DVD's, Rania uses the classic layering approach of teaching the basic step, then adding on the hips and/or arms so that you don't have to try and master everything at once. This classic approach is used by dance instructors everywhere and-aside from doing monotonous drills of basic movements-there is really no other way to maintain an aerobic pace while learning and practicing a new step. Most students prefer this technique, because they want to experience the sensation of ""dancing"" rather than just repeating steps.

If you are looking for more thorough teaching of the basic steps, you should try one of the many bellydance instructional videos on the market. There are many high-quality DVD's created by instructors such as Jillina. It is also important to remember that there is no substitute for taking classes with a competent dance teacher.

If your interest in bellydance goes beyond just ""having fun,"" if you think you may want to perform some day, and/or if you are concerned about avoiding injury, you should supplement your home workouts with lessons from a qualified teacher.

It is important to keep in mind that the difficulty level varies quite a bit among the four DVD's. Pure Sweat and Cardio Shimmy are much more challenging than Bellydance Boogie and Hip Hop Drop.

More experienced dancers can move on to Rania's more advanced workout DVD, My Personal Trainer. It includes the more challenging, faster-paced segments from these DVD's, plus some additional drills for specific parts of the body. There is more emphasis on complex movements, and the movements are not broken down. My Personal Trainer is a real bargain, since it provides 7 distinct workouts, with the option to create a large number of longer or shorter workouts.

Virtually everyone will enjoy watching Rania's performances at the end of each workout video. As a dancer, she lacks expression and seems more focused on remembering the next step than on feeling the rhythm of the music. However, she is still interesting to watch because she is a very technically proficient dancer and the choreography is unique.",1203465600,6,2757,5.032894736842105

I had to start one DVD and when it passed the warm-up and work-out session, I had to put on the next DVD and fast forward to the the work-out session, stop it, and put on another DVD and forward to the next work-out session, and so on.  One DVD's work out was only 25 minutes start to finish which isn't long enough for me. So if you don't mind combining, this is a great workout.",1188518400,2,636,4.154471544715447
1328393,4,B00003ETJZ,"Not for everybody, but some people will like this

I would recommend this video to people who are looking for a medium-paced slightly-repetitive dance workout.  This is not a belly dance technique instructional video.

Overall I liked the video's routine - it has a straightfoward sequence of common bellydance moves that give a good workrout.  (I have no idea why it is called ""Hip Hop"" because this seems to be standard bellydance moves.)  Rania demonstrates each move slowly once or twice, then you do it a bunch of times, then you add it on to the whole routine from the beginning to include all the parts that you've learned so far.
Some people will like the repition to refine/practice doing each move and to do many repititions to get a more sustained workout of the muscles.  I find the redundancy to be boring and overcame it by jumping directly to Track 17's full dance routine after I had learned the moves step by step.

The one thing that I didn't like and found distracting was the instructor:  She has a weird seducing blank stare that follows the camera, she bobs her head like a valley-girl, and her posture is a bit hunched over.  Other than that, her form is usually decent(though not perfect), and the 4 other people in her ""class"" are more pleasant to watch because they have better form and look more natural/relaxed.
Even with her weird look, I still prefer her over the Veena/Neena plastic smile twins.  I think the  combinations of moves in this Hip Drop video are slightly more complicated than the Veena/Neena videos; beginners might initially find it hard to catch on to Rania's combinations, but it shouldn't be a problem for int-advanced dancers.

THE 35 MIN WORKOUT HAS THE FOLLOWING TRACKS:
2-7.  Warm Up (roll shoulders, snake arms, chest drops, hip circles, hip drops, hip lifts, stretch waist)
8-9. step together step touch while hip circle, then hip drop between
10.  step forward while hip lift, then walk backward while chest drop.  11. from beginning
12.  step side, hip ""scoop"" & drop.  13. from beginning
14.  step side w/ hip lift, step together w/ hip drop.  15. from beginning
16.  hip drop alternating with kick  17. Whole Routine from beginning
18.  Cool down (5 min variety of stretches)

Arms will definitely get a workout just by holding them out during the dance routine (if you are already in super shape, maybe you could even hold a light weight in your hands to make it tough)

BONUS SEGMENTS.
*12min Arms/Chest/Back
---Snake arms, shoulders fwd/back/shimmy, chest lift/drop,
---Series of bending and straighting arms to the front, side & up, while tensing muscles or with light  weights.
---Push ups
---Back hyperextension while lie on stomach
---Stretch back & arms
*Performances of Egyptian dances (I feel she lacks personality & stage precense)
*Workout to music w/o narration

This video is meant to be a WORKOUT and not an instructional tape, so there aren't specific cues about the proper technique of each bellydance move (e.g. what is a circle, drop, etc. and Don't arch your back with most moves).

1328395,4,B00003ETJZ,"I enjoy using these DVDs.  They're well-done, and provide a good workout [especially cardio-shimmy!!].  The only real drawback for me is Rania's often vacant facial expressions...but I can overlook that for a good time.  The moves are demonstrated well and are shown from different angles as the videos progress.

If you're looking for a really good instructional DVD set, this might not be it, but if you want a good workout combined with bellydance moves - this is a good pick.",1177372800,,479,4.8765432098765435

1328397,4,B00003ETJZ,"These DVD's are great if you want an exercise video that keeps you going constantly!  However, she doesn't give you enough time to learn new moves. It adds different moves many times during the exercise and assumes you know how to incorporate the new moves in right away. Other than sometimes looking pretty ridiculous, I like it. I would recommend purchasing a hip scarf with 1 or 2 rows of coins because it helps with sticking to the beat.",1174521600,,441,4.582278481012659
1328398,5,B00003ETJZ,"Personally I find the belly dance videos with Rania to be the best for learning and comprehension.  she walks through the moves and you can see full figure movement to learn with the instruction.  Most belly dance learning videos zoom in on the persons upper body or face while they are instructing, and talk as if you have an understanding of belly dancing up front.  If I can't see what the hips are doing how can I understand, or learn the actual movement?  But I have always liked Rania's videos they are great excercise, great fun, and excellent for learning whether you're just learning how to belly dance or have known for years!",1173398400,2,636,4.601769911504425
1328399,2,B00003ETJZ,"The title of this set is very misleading for two reasons:  If you are looking to lose weight these are not the dvd's for you.  They are very slow paced and not interesting.  The music is completly awful, not to mention it's all voice over.  Rania never even utters a word.

  The number two reason they are misleading is because it says belly dancing in the title.  Yes, the moves are based loosely onbelly dancing... but none of the actresses, (including Rania) are real belly dancers.  They're technique is worse than mine, and I am a beginner.  Belly dancing is supposed to be about isolating your abdominals,  and all of them show the kind of technique you could find in a sleezy strip club.  And further more the voice over never even attempts to tell you what you are supposed to be doing with your muscles or how to do the movement.  The only way you could do them is if you already have a pretty good knowledge of belly dancing, which I do.  And don't think you'll get any help from watching them because they can't do the movements correctly either.  So if you are truly interested in losing weight or belly dancing don't waste your time or money on this set.  The belly dancing they showed was not real belly dancing.

1328400,3,B00003ETJZ,"I rented this at my library & glad I did. The productoin was great, the backup girls were the usual plastered smiled stiffly moving zombies as was Rania with the uninspiring naration. The music was atrocious, it was like a cross of elevator music & 70s adult movie music. It totally killed my desire & wanted to say ""what beat?"" whenever Rania said to ""make sure you keep with the beat.""

It has a short warm up of simple snake arms & steping, etc.

The main workout is a lot of shimmying. Shimming regular, on toes *choo shoo* & while hoping to 4 corners. Occassionally she'll add in shoulder shimmies while steping fwd with a hiplift (don't expect instruction on that). In the middle, you'll get a ""king tut"" walk *simple* to take a break, but adds in shimmies. I only got interested toward the end when she did hip twists while shimminging. But she was back to the routine of shimming ragular, 4 corners, shoulder shimy & more shimming.

The cooldown of a few minutes was a sitting wide legged stretching to each leg & center, simple sitting fwd bend with straight legs, layding down leg crossed over spinal twist & lastly, a simpel arm crossed over chest stretch.

Her end dance was to triabal drums with a hint of synthesizer which sounded unique & I loved it. She was actually decent, had some flow to her movement for once *she excutes well, but no flow & very stiff usually* & I perked up the most for that & danced along.",1172102400,,1430,4.4465648854961835

1328403,4,B00003ETJZ,"Rania's focus on shimmies takes over this especially energetic bellydance workout. Her youthful exuberance is inspiring and there is a sensual energy throughout. Everyone seems to be having a good time in this workout and the turquoise outfits are beautiful.

At times you are gliding across the floor like a ballerina and then at other times you are doing shimmies and bouncing in four directions, imagine shimmying and then changing directions four times. This makes the workout even more intense. To top if all off, Rania repeats the main exercises so you learn them fast and then includes a choreographed routine at the end.

If you want a bellydance workout with a very challenging and fast-paced routine, then this should satisfy your desire for an all over meltdown - perfect in the winter to heat up your entire body - you can feel the calories melting off. This workout is one I only do if I'm spending the next day in bed reading. But seriously, it is energetic, intense and seems designed for anyone who is intermediate to advanced. This should tighten and tone you all over and you may even notice a difference when you look in the mirror the next day.

the voice over is creepy and the cuing is off but i have to say i really like the repetition. once a move is introduced you do it numerous times before it is put into sequence. the camera moves around a lot and shows all the dancers doing the move but they all do the move differently. i really wish they'd just focus on rania doing the movements.

i really like the bonus waist scupling and ab isolations.

1328407,5,B00003ETJZ,"I bought the four disc set, and decided to review them separately.

This was the first one I chose to try out. So, I pried myself out of bed first thing in the morning and put this in. At first, it seemed just a little too easy, but by the end, I was just about done for. For someone who has at least a little experience with bellydance, the moves are simple to understand. Having not been able to really dance in several years, this reminded me just why I fell in love with it from the beginning. I worked all those muscles again, and it left me feeling sore the next day, but fantastic for the rest of that day.

I would not recommend this to anyone who doesn't know anything about bellydance, however. The moves, while not complicated, are mostly ill-suited to absolute beginners. I know I could not have made it through this workout if I tried this back when I started! I would have gotten frustrated and given up.

Otherwise, this is an incredibly fun workout from beginning to end.",1167955200,3,987,4.353260869565218
1328408,4,B00003ETJZ,"I would classify this as a beginner level exercise routine with intermediate level choreograhy (as an exercise, not as a dance instruction). Like most dance-oriented workouts, it may take some practice to master all of the moves in this routine to really feel it working, which could be frustrating for those looking for an intense aerobic workout with very basic moves. This is however an efficient aerobic workout overall that primarily works the abdominal and calve muscles. I was actually pleasantly surprised by the background music which wasn't exactly ""hip hop"" as most of us know it (rap lyrics, etc.), but instead featured instrumental music with a more classic hip-hop inspired sensual groove - both upbeat yet non distracting. The dancers are fun to watch and the set is spacious yet simple. I was particularly impressed by the two bonus feature bellydance routines that Rania does - especially the beautiful costume, choreography and music of the Egyptian dance called ""Wings of Isis""! Overall, a fun, effective video that will add some variety to your cardio workouts.",1167350400,2,1081,5.1477272727272725
1328409,1,B00003ETJZ,"I received these DVDs for my birthday, and was disappointed to find that Rania wasn't all that I expected her to be. She wasn't that bad of a dancer, but the women in the background were horrible. They lacked in technique. When belly dance is about isolating movements to certain areas of the body, these girls were bobbing up and down like jackhammers. If you are looking for a good beginning foundation for Belly Dance, there are many other products that will help much more than these DVDs. If you are only looking for an aerobic workout, then I suggest only buying Cardio Shimmy, because it is the only one that will really make you sweat. Otherwise, the videos move at a slow pace, teach incorrect technique, and you have to perform two in a row to get even the slightest bit of a workout. Save your money and time and buy something else.",1167177600,10,843,4.48051948051948
1328410,5,B00003ETJZ,"As a non-dancer type person, I found this workout quite challenging and very efficient at getting the heart rate up.  The extra workouts are great as well and I really like the ability to work out my abs without getting on the floor.  And the Cardio Shimmy - I only did it for a few minutes and my abs killed me the next day.

I also like the fact that there are four other people doing the same workout so that I can see four other different ways of performing the same move.  I find myself watching the tall blond with shorter hair on Rania's right quite a bit and copying her moves more than Rania's.

I also have Too Hip and Rania's version of My Personal Trainer and highly recommend those as well.  Too Hip is a bit more advanced overall than I'm ready for right now but I do like the warmup a little better than some of the others.  Using the DVDs makes it easy to tailor my workout to my preferences.

If you're looking for something fun that will get you moving, I highly recommend this one.",1165622400,3,1000,4.198952879581152

She does introduce bellydance movements and compose combinations but they are probably not the sort of combinations would take with you to the dance floor.  She will give you combinations of about 4 eight-counts a piece and you will repeat them over and over for the length of a song.  Rania is a very beautiful dancer so I expected a little more.

Even as a workout, they were pretty slow, I didn't feel like I had worked up to cardiovascular benefit personally (I am 25 but I am not sure if that makes a whole lot of difference).

There are some performance peices on the dvd but the Bellydance Superstars dvd has better ones, in my opinion.

If you want to spice up your step-class workout- you might enjoy these but if you are hoping to learn how to bellydance, I would recommend something else.",1164326400,2,867,4.561290322580645

As a workout it's not bad though. It's still more fun than going to gym. Just don't expect it to be very inspiring. The music is not only inappropriate for bellydancing; it's so bland that it doesn't motivate you to move at all.",1155081600,,565,4.280373831775701

Not only is the technique only adequate but the music is less then exciting- and certainly in no way ""Hip Hop"" or anything close to it. The instructor provides instruction as a voice over and often goes off beat which is very distracting as well as the frozen look on her face. Many of the background dancers have personality and the filming is good, but overall I would not expect much from this video- the name is the most exciting part.",1151798400,,506,4.451612903225806
1328429,3,B00003ETJZ,"The exercises and the music are somewhat repetitive, but that can be the beauty of some exercise routines. If you are not in the mood to think too deeply about exercising on any specific day then this can be a way to get into a routine and flow with the motions. Each exercise has an extended learning session so by the time you put the routine together your body knows exactly how to move. Most of the dancing moves side-to-side or back and front with very little need for concentrating on footwork. Most of the movement seems to be in the hips and you circle your hips as you move from side-to-side or you practice raising and dropping your hips to the beat. Uncomplicated hand movements make this easier than most routines. The mood is slightly heavier than a bouncy bellydance routine and Rania seems serious about exercising, even when smiling. Her instructions are in voice over and are calming, yet precise. You can feel this working your stomach especially in areas that seem more difficult when doing sit-ups.

I just love the way she teaches the moves becasue they are clear and many of the reviews say she is stiff but I think this is good because as a beginner you get to see the fundamentals of the move.

I have had this DVD along with the hip hop hip drop for two weeks and I already lost 10 pounds, of course is not just excersise alone but I eat a light breakfast so I can do my belly dance in the morning and then before going to bed I eat really light so I can do the hip hop hip drop belly dance video at night.

1328434,5,B00003ETJZ,"I have built up a library of bellydance videos over the last few months (both purely instructional and fitness oriented) and I have to say that I really LOVE this set.  If you dabble in bellydance or are a student (I would say up to advance-beginner) then I think you'll really enjoy these DVDs.  The workouts are all roughly 30 minutes long with lots of fun moves (I'm a BEGINNER and I learned a lot!).  They are short enough to remain fun and still get you moving.  I'm sorry, but I just can't handle hour long workouts yet.  Sure, you may want to watch the Workout all the way through before you try it, but any new set of movements and steps takes practice.  Few fitness videos are perfect in regards to camerawork and perfect cueing.  But besides all that, each DVD comes with a ""bonus"" workout, which I believe are all gathered on another DVD sold separately.  I like to do the bonus workouts with some stretching in the morning and then the full workouts at night.  It's great that there are four DVDs to choose from.  I change up between the different workouts and my purely instructional videos each night.  Even with just the four and a couple of Veena & Neena's workouts I can workout all week and not repeat myself.  Some people complain about Rania's lack of smile and seeming stiffness, but really it isn't so extreme as to be distracting.  She moves so beautifully so who cares?  The voice over is upbeat and the dancers look like they're having fun.  The music can get a little cheesy though, but that hardly qualifies as a strike.  I say ignore any bad reviews and go for it.  You get four DVDs for under $30!  It's a great value, I swear it.",1136246400,23,1659,4.401315789473684
1328435,3,B00003ETJZ,"I had read the extremely mixed reviews of Rania's fitness series, but I wanted to try it out for myself, so I chose this one, which seemed to have gotten more stars than some of the others.  I'll tell you what, I was disappointed but not necessarily surprised.  After reading so many reviews that called these dvds ""repetitive"", or that the music was awful, or that Rania has a horribly bored expression, I just couldn't be shocked to find that it was all true.  This dvd definitely did not inspire me to buy the others in the set.  The only reason I even keep it around instead of trying to give it away (or throw it away!) is the extra arms, chest and back workout that's listed as a bonus.  I sometimes still do the bonus workout, but I've given up on the cardio.  It's too light even for light days, repetitive, and unmotivating.  Besides that, the music really doesn't fit into any category I can think of except the very worst elevator music.

Update 10/31/2013: Al right, so I've had since 2005 to sit with this one, and I think I've softened toward it a bit.  I no longer think Rania looks bored, I think her expression is one of concentration.  I don't do this workout a lot, but it's really good for days when I feel sick or I'm too tired to do a really hard workout.  I know all the steps and I can perform the moves confidently now, so it's kind of a no-brainer.  The music no longer annoys me.  And there's also a pretty darn good bonus arm workout that can be done with or without weights, and I've done it quite a few times over the years, so I feel as if I've gotten my money's worth.  For a winter's day when I'm coming down with a cold but I really want to stay on track and exercise every day, this one works quite well.  The arm workout is something I've tacked onto the end of other workouts quite a bit for an extra toning boost.  As for being repetitive, we learn through repetition.  I would recommend this DVD to beginners, people who are starting out getting fit, sickies, and people who like to do long drills and really get the moves down.",1129334400,2,2067,4.272493573264781

The performance at the end is the most atrocious bellydancing I've ever seen in my life. This lady should not have been a bellydancer I'm sorry. She lacks grace, she lacks nusicality.

1328449,4,B00003ETJZ,"Once you practice the moves and get into the dances it doesn't seem like an exercise program, but it does take practice.

I enjoy it now that I learned most of the moves.",1124236800,,170,4.151515151515151
1328450,4,B00003ETJZ,"I originally purchased this set since I was getting bored of regular cardio workouts.  Overall, I enjoy doing the workouts.  The first time I couldn't quite get all of the steps, but after the second time it's easy to catch on.  It is definitely not as strenous as say tae bo, but it's fun so I am more motivated to do it.  Plus I feel like I am standing up straighter since I'm working my back and abs more.  I absolutely love the bonus workouts on each DVD, they definitely made me sore the next day--I love that feeling!",1121731200,15,523,4.242424242424242
1328451,5,B00003ETJZ,"I love this video.  I alternate it with Carmen Electra's Fit To Strip DVD and the Bellydance Boogie, also from Raina.  I feel so much more coordinated and sexy since I started doing Cardio Shimmy.  I can really feel the burn in my hips and upper thighs as well as my arms and shoulders.  It's a great cardio workout without being boring.",1119398400,,337,4.387096774193548
1328452,3,B00003ETJZ,"I lead a group of women who are learning belly dance through videos, here is some of what we've had to say...

Hip-Hop Hip-Drop, Belly Dance Boogie, Pure Sweat:

We like that these coordinated the moves into a routine that builds, however she has a tendancy to not warn you that you are switching to something else.  Also when the camera angle changes it sometimes gets you off step from the video.

Cardio Shimmy:

Remember what I said about her not telling you what was coming up?  This video is so fast paced that the lack of warning caused us to nearly run into eachother.  I suggest watching this one first before you try it.",1117324800,14,630,4.426086956521739
1328453,5,B00003ETJZ,"What a great way to work out!  Not to mention practicing bellydance moves!  This will get your heart rate up and put a smile on your face!

Some of the other reviewers say Rania is stiff.  But she's not stiff at all.  However, I think I can figure out why people would say that!

After watching the workouts before I did them, I realized that Rania has VERY slim hips.  And since so much of belly dance involves hip movement, it appears that she is not moving her hips very much.

So don't hesitate to spice up your boring old workout with some fun, not to mention sexy, dance moves!

Update:  I've been working out on a consistent basis for about two months now.  I'm doing the Cardio Shimmy at this point in time and I've lost a dress size!  So ladies shake your shimmy, have a blast and lose weight!

Update and info for my disabled Sisters:  I have Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis and have very bad balance.  Even with my issues, I am able to do all of the moves, except one, plus the parts of the cool down where you have to stand on one foot.  So I simply substitute another movement which I can do and for the parts of the cool down where I am supposed to stand on one foot, I use a piece of furniture for balance.  So the moral of this story is, just because you have balance problems, and you want to bellydance, adapt whatever you need to and GO FOR IT!!!  BECAUSE BELLYDANCING WORKOUTS ARE FUN!!!  So...have fun with the workout I'm currently doing and Hip Drop to Hip Hop!!!  WOO-HOO!!!

UPDATE:  Well, I'm currently doing Pure Sweat and I just want to say, that is is QUITE an intense workout!  Very fast-paced and I'm having a bit of trouble learning some of the moves.  But...it's getting easier and it's loads of fun, like the other two I've learnt so far!  What a gift to have a workout I don't have to make myself do.  I do it for the pure pleasure of moving my body to music.

UPDATE:  I've been doing Bellydance Boogie, and it's a LOT harder than it looks.  It's really more of a strength training workout than an aerobic workout.  Due to my balance problems and vertigo, I can't do a few of the movements, I simply do other things.  I'd say that this workout is my least favorite of all of them.  However, it does teach some essential bellydance movements.",1113523200,23,2286,4.318396226415095
1328454,3,B00003ETJZ,"I would like to know where I should start from. I have bought the 4 DVD-s of Rania: bellydance boogie, pure sweat, cardio shimmy and hip drop hip hop. I am a beginner and in my opinion Rania is passing really quickly from simple moves to very complex, where coordination is very important. For her it might be easy, but for a beginner takes time. These moves should be explained. For example the position of the arms coordinated with steps is difficult at beginning.",1112227200,2,466,4.559523809523809
1328455,5,B00003ETJZ,"If you're not familiar with the Bellydancer Rania and her Bellydance Fitness for Weight Loss series, she is an AFAA certified Fitness Instructor and internationally renowned bellydancer. Her four part workout series fuses bellydance moves with a variety of different Western musical rhythms in her belief that bellydance can be done to any kind of music. With soundtracks not always coming off as authentic sounding as one may like -- you'll have to use your imagination a bit when you hear the `Disneyesque' and sometimes cartoonish sounding strains of Hip Hop, Salsa, and R & B. The Bellydance Fitness for Weight Loss series are a set of fun workouts and a great way to interject life into a dull and stale workout routine.

Before beginning each workout it's important to keep in mind what these are -- workouts. Although you will learn some bellydance, as all of the routines are nearly completely comprised of bellydance moves, don't expect to buy this set and have it be your one-stop shopping for instruction and workout. They haven't made anything like that yet. The pacing required for instruction is way too slow to get your heart rate up for a cardiovascular or fat burning workout. Rania does a very good job of  creating routines with moves using similar muscle groups, starting with a slower tempo to teach the move and then returning quickly to full tempo, layering all the movements together to create an interesting routine. Lots of repetition will give you plenty of great bellydance practice.

Each one of the four follows a similar format and vary only in specific content and theme. One thing that's nice about the whole set is the variety in movement that each will offer you. Rania selected moves for each of the four workouts to work different areas of the body. With the whole set, you'll get the most rounded workout.

Cardio Shimmy features the signature shimmies that are the hallmark all good bellydance performances. This workout uses a variety of these high-tempo, and high-energy bellydance moves. It also highlights a calf-building move known as a chu chu. It's one workout guaranteed to get your heart-rate up as quickly as you can wiggle your hips, buns, thighs, and shoulders. The Bonus section of this disc includes two performances, Rania's Techno Drum Solo and Rania's veil dance in traditional style, that later helped to form the ""Bellydance Divas"" CD as well as the ""Waist Sculpting"" workout that later became one 10 minute segment of ""Bellydance Fitness for Weight Loss: Daily Quickies...5 Ten Minute Workouts.""

Bellydance Boogie is supposed to fuse the sounds of Hip Hop and R&B with bellydance but once again you have to use your imagination here. It's the slowest of the four workouts, tempo wise, but not the easiest. The smoother and more undulating bellydance moves featured here will work your muscles in surprising ways considering its slower pace -- further proof that a faster, higher impact workout isn't always a better one. The Bonus section of this disc includes Rania's sword dance and Rania's improvisation dance from ""Divas"" and The 10 minute long Dancer's Legs & Buns workout from ""Bellydance Quickies.""

Hip Drop Hip Hop - Not exactly street style Hip Hop sounds here, but if you work your imagination a bit, urban dance-esque in feel. This workout is a bellydance routine set to 80's style hip hop instrumental music. The Bonus section has Rania's Wings of Isis dance as well as one other from ""Divas"" and the Arms, Chest, and Back workout from ""10 Minute Bellydance Quickies.""

Pure Sweat - Pure Sweat is the ""Latin-esque"" flavored bellydance workout and, of the four in this series, is by far the lightest workout. Try this one first if you're really out of shape. If you're no stranger to excercise, save this one for your 'light' excercise day. The music is more `tropical' sounding than Salsa as it claims; you could imagine the soundtrack being written by Disney. A couple of the bellydance moves featured here are similar to Salsa moves and with slight styling variations could easily be transposed -- further proof that learning one dance will help you in the learning process for another. The Bonus section features Rania's veil and cane dance as well as her Turkish 9/8 count Rompi Rompi dance from ""Divas"" and has the 10 minute Abs Isolation segment from ""Quickies.""

The workouts are set in a studio and Rania is backed up by a small group of dancers in matching workout attire w/ hip scarves -- similar in look and feel of the Crunch workout series but without all those annoying logos. The back up dancer's bodies are all variations on different female body types with some being curvy and some skinny, and at least one should look how your body could look if it were in a little better, but not rock hard, shape.

Each of the four workouts has a warm up of roughly  5 minutes. 20 minutes is spent on each disc devoted to instruction and routines. All four finish with a cool down and stretch segment of approximately 5 minutes in length. My biggest complaint is that I wish workouts were longer in length. 30 minutes just isn't enough for me to keep the fat molecules at bay. I would rather the workout be an hour in length and I could always quit part way through on days I have only 30-40 minutes to workout. Also, studies show that the body does not even begin to burn fat until after 20-30 minutes of sustained cardiovascular activity. If you're not loosing weight, consider doing more than one in a row for a great, results-getting workout. Then once you reach your target shape, one a day can be used as a maintenance program.

Not a lot of explanation is given to the individual bellydance moves but nearly everything is done in half-time to start before moving up to full tempo. Rania's voiceover often gives pointers as to how the moves are done but one would need to either be a little bit familiar with bellydance, or have a dance friendly set of coordination skills. Nearly anyone could eventually pick up most of the bellydance being done on these DVDs with enough patience and practice. Even without doing the moves perfectly you'll still have fun and get a good workout. Only the beginner absolutely new to all forms of dance would be truly lost. Some of the names Rania gives to certain Bellydance moves are different than I've heard them called before but this is common in the dance world where dancers come up with a move and patent the only part people can't `steal' -- the name. Don't let this bother you; it happens in Bellydance, Hip Hop, Salsa, et all. The move is probably the same thing you learned in class just with a different name.

Probably the biggest complaints about Rania's DVDs are concerning her stiffness, often vacant look, and inability to sustain a heartfelt smile. The look and smile I just consider window dressing for a video; I'm certainly more concerned with her ability to dance and teach. As far as her stiffness goes, it does have one advantage here -- a slightly stiff body is actually easier for a beginner to follow because lots of extra movement is distracting to the beginner who is merely trying to get the essence of a move down pat. While it may irritate an intermediate to professional dancer to watch, the beginner will benefit, and although Rania is certainly not the most fluid of dancers, the routines in the bonus section will attest that some, but not all, of her stiffness comes from making the workout moves look simpler. This is, of course, a fitness video for beginners.

In all, each of the four workouts are fun and you'll learn a little bit of dance. I just wish they all were longer.",1109462400,120,7634,4.748114630467572

1328458,4,B00003ETJZ,"I just finished doing this workout for the sixth time and my face is that beet red color pale skin gets after exercise. That is how I know it was a good workout, not to mention I am hot and tired and feeling that pleasant rush one gets after exercise.

  Anyway, this video starts with a warm up that I like because I can tell that even the warm up will tone my muscles. It includes hip circles, snake arms, and hip drops, all moves that I can feel in my muscles after doing them. Normally I hop around a bit as I am getting a workout DVD to the right place and skip the boring warm up but I do this one because it feels beneficial.

  The workout consists of a series of short dance combinations that are taught slowly and then quickly. Each one is layered on top of the next until you end up doing 5 different combinations in a row. The moves are easy to learn -not frustrating at all- I learned them the first time I did this video. I can still hear in my head ""step together step touch drop drop drop.""

  This is a workout video and a good one for a beginner, not an instruction video so I have not taken a star off for bouncy non belly dance form or for facial expression. The reason I took a star off is because it was a little shorter and less intense than I wanted. When all five combinations are put together, you only get to do it three times before Rania says it is time for cool down. I have to get my remote and go back a bunch of times to get the workout that matches my energy level.

  All in all though I enjoy this as a short workout video",1109030400,9,1558,3.990322580645161
1328459,4,B00003ETJZ,I do belly dance and found this video a fun workout and easy to follow. Easy to remember combinations. Good for a beginner. Rania is stiff and has a fake/glazed mannequin smile. She also fails to isolate for belly dance and tends to shake it for club dancing but I knew better than to follow. It was helpful and I really will buy other things from her because of that but I suggest to someone learning belly dance that they take a class first then start with Neena and Veena. Jillina is too advanced for a beginner and this one is just not proper technique. More for a fun workout. I will use it again and again.,1106870400,5,612,4.239316239316239
1328460,4,B00003ETJZ,"While this is certainly an enjoyable workout, it is my least favorite in the series.  This is because the final routine doesn't look as good as the other workouts.  As the title suggests, you will get your heart rate up by doing the ""shimmy"" (moving your hips up and down really quickly).  This particular move is essential in Bellydancing, and this workout will give you a lot of practice.  I am quite fit and this workout left me puffing and panting.

However, in one section of the workout, the narration is inconsistent with the visuals.  Further, I haven't noticed any significant weight loss and the stretches in the cooldown section may be a little difficult for some people.  The bonus workout is similar to the ""Bellydance Boogie"" and ""Hip Hop Hip Drop"" workouts (which are great!)

The bottom line is, getting your heart rate up doesn't necessarily mean you will lose weight.  But you will learn some vital moves and have fun!",1105833600,6,936,4.728395061728395
1328461,5,B00003ETJZ,"I LOVE these workout videos.  I have the entire Rania collection and I cannot complain about any one of them.  You will use muscles you didn't know you had.

I hate the ""dime a dozen"" Pilates, Yoga, and run of the mill aerobic videos.  They are so BORING!  Not these videos...give me dance workout any day!

I just had a baby and I am looking forward to getting back to the bellydance workout.  I am sure it will tone up my ab muscles quickly.  I highly recommend these DVDs to anyone with ""powerhouse"" problem areas.  Your belly will thank you!",1105056000,2,545,4.37

At no point did my pulse rise during the workout.  I felt that the video was slow and way too repetetive and I got bored.  I realize that she is a dancer and not an instructor, but I do feel that the words should go along with the moves.

I'm not saying that the video was terrible....but it just wasn't what I needed.  It wasn't aerobic at all.",1104710400,3,497,4.020408163265306

Not a dance recital, not a performance for other dancers, not a guide on how to master bellydancing..! W-O-R-K-O-U-T.

Okay, that being said, as a WORKOUT video, I find it awesome and great fun. Rania's gorgeous and her smiling face kept me perked up from the beginning and the choice of dancers in a variety of sizes should be applauded. There's a slim one, a curvy one, a little plump one and even a super pale one who looked like she could use a tan badly. Not that it matters of course as this is a bellydance video and not some kinda beauty pageant :D

I really wanted something that would target the lower area. I loved it. It was a little difficult for me to follow at first, which didn't surprise me because I don't learn things very quickly. But after a couple tries, I got it down. After doing it for a month, I got Cardio Shimmy. Wow! That one was much more difficult. I can't do everything in it yet, but I love it. They both bring up my heart rate and work your lower body if you do it the way she tells you to. I love the extra workouts on there also. They have an ab and a waist sculpting workout. I can really feel it. But these aren't for people who want an advance workout.

I read some of the reviews and didn't agree with most of the negative ones. For those people who obviously can't read.....THE EXERCISE VIDEOS ARE ""FITNESS FOR WEIGHT LOSS"" VIDOES...THEY AREN'T INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS ON HOW TO BELLYDANCE GRACEFULLY.

I find that any video/dvd workouts get repetitive over time, which why I turn the monitor off and get to the studio/ class or go running.

To keep an open mind to other styles that bellydancers have, I was searching for other workout/instructional dvd's. I saw Rania on the belly dance superstars tape. I was amazed at her belly rolls. I decided to purchase the cardio shimmy. But before I purchased it, I wanted to read the reviews to see what others thought of it. I read the reviews on Amazon and saw that there were alot of negative reviews and only one positve. I did the work out and I thought it was great. I think that if you want to pursue bellydancing further such as teaching or performing, that this is not only a good workout tape but, can help a begginer master shimmies and choo-choo's as well. Heck,I didn't even know the term choo-choo until I purchased the dvd. As for the music,I enjoyed it.",1083888000,10,897,4.409638554216867
1328479,3,B00003ETJZ,"I bought a combination video which had hip drop hip hop & Pure sweat. I didn't really mind the music or setting, but the video becomes boring quickly. Not only that, but it does not offer a challenging workout. ( I'm not overweight, yet not fit ) If you are overweight though, the video isn't too hard to do(rewind button for a few moves) and it little by little teaches you a nice dance at the end of the workout. If your somewhat fit, save your money and buy something else, I personally like billy blanks tae bo videos, they'll make you sweat! :o)",1081209600,3,550,4.298076923076923
1328480,5,B00003ETJZ,"I have quite a collection of bellydance videos, owning all of Rania's workouts, all but one of Veena and Neena's, and two of Dolphina's (Intro to Bellydance and Warrior Goddess). I must say, as much as I practice each one of them, this one never seems to get old; I could do it everyday. Granted it's not traditional, flowing, bellydance, it's fun 100%. Besides, to any of those complaining about this workout being too rigid, consider this - you bought a Bellydance FITNESS DVD, not a Learn to Bellydance video.
  And fitness you cetainly get: great warmup, awesome routine that leaves room for your own attitude to come through, and soothing cooldown. If nothing else, buy it for Rania's performance at the end - very powerful!",1079481600,10,729,4.777777777777778
1328481,4,B00003ETJZ,"I noticed a lot of comments about the bad music.  I guess I just tuned it out because I didn't notice it one way or the other!
I'm not a belly dancer or dancer of any sort so I can't comment on the authenticity of the dancing but I was looking for a good cardio routine that was different from the basic grapevine, step, etc. workouts and that is what I found.  I think it is very intense and I consider myself intermediate.  I've actually had a hard time doing the whole thing nonstop.
My calves killed me the next day after doing the choo-choos (shimmy on tippy-toes) but you can always work into it gradually.  I did feel than Rania had a pretty fakey look on her face most of the time - kind of like a stepford wife look.  I actually focused more on the 2 blondes in the back that looked like they were having more fun.
All in all I would recommend this DVD as a good one for your collection.",1079395200,3,896,4.097142857142857
1328482,1,B00003ETJZ,"I chose one star because initially this video was fun to do.  The reason why I bought it was because I thought it would be fun to bellydance to some modern music, and mix things up a little.  My sisters and I have had a good deal of fun working out together to it, but then after a week or so....the music really sucks.  It's pretty much just the same thing over and over and over....etc.  Also, she sticks her chest out the whole time and affects ungraceful postures.
Her voice is nearly unbearable, but once you get used to it it's not so bad...if only her smile seemed genuine it might be a little more fun to watch.  Her backround dancers are definitely better than she is, and Rania's dance routine at the end was so repetitive and forced that I've only watched it once all the way through.  (For those of you familiar with Veena and Neena, you will understand it when I say that when THEY do routines, you can hardly tear your eyes away.)
I did enjoy learning the different steps, but I must tell you that it's not one that I find myself doing very often now.  Just too annoying.",1079049600,3,1085,4.263414634146342
1328483,3,B00003ETJZ,"I've taught fitness for over 15 years.  I was a jazz dance major in college and have also started studying various forms of Middle Eastern Dance.  My review of Rania's videos will incorporate all three points of view.
In terms of fitness, this is where they rate the best.  The Cardio Shimmy is the most challenging, at about a beg-intermediate low-impact workout level.  They are safe moves, although I believe Rania left out some key verbal cues for proper technique and alignment.  The verbal cuing on the DVDs is also either not aligned properly with the video, or Rania cues late.  A participant needs time to react to verbal cuing, thus the instructor needs to cue a couple beats ahead of a new move in order for it to be effective.  A good amount of the cues were also completely off beat with the music.  Once you know the moves, play the DVD with only the music.  Rania and her team are in very good shape, so in this way are inspiring.
  From a dance perspective I find Rania's style to be very stiff.  This stiff style works very well with her performance of the Phaeronic Temple dance (bonus feature).  Her delivery, smile and arm movements are wooden, maybe she was nervous.  Her ""back-up"" dancers were pleasant to watch, as they exhibited more grace, extension and ease.
  From a Middle Eastern Dance background I've most commonly seen a different method of doing hip isolations.  Rania initiates the movement by straightening the leg.  While this can be a good way to help beginners, it also needs to be emphasized that most hip isolations are not meant to rely on the leg movement, the legs are just ""carried along"".  This difference in technique shows greatest when Rania looses her hip shimmy a few times (in Cardio Shimmy), with lots of movement still going on in her legs.
  I recommend this series to beginners who wants a light, different workout at home, or someone who wants to get an idea of beginner belly dance moves at home before going out to study somewhere.  More exprienced dancers can also use the simple combinations to brush up on their technique or practice zill drills (although it's not Middle Eastern Music) along with their dancing.
  The special features were enjoyable.  I've watched Sohaila over and over again.  She has impeccable, inspiring technique, elegance and grace.  Marina is a little firecracker with lots of energy.  Her drum solo and cane dance are lovely.  Lochia shows folk inspired dance with interesting combinations of folk inspired costuming in cabaret style fabrics.  Rania's temple dance was well executed, the costume beautiful.",1076025600,34,2592,4.811791383219955
1328484,1,B00003ETJZ,"If you are interested in her style and the DVDs, I recommend you buy only one of the four. The rest will be all the same. Many repetitions, and little creativity of movement. The bonuses are good, both the performance and the workout. I bought all four, and now I'm selling them all on ebay. I could not even do all four at least once, since I realized after three that they are all the same. Save your money, there are much better belly dancing videos out there.",1074902400,14,463,4.2727272727272725
1328485,1,B00003ETJZ,"Not only did I not sweat, but my heart beat didn't raise any. I will grant that I work out a lot.

This is probably a good workout if you're really out of shape. A total beginner might get a workout, but if your already work out regularly, keep your money and invest elsewhere. The Cardio Shimmy from the same series is actually pretty good.

Also, the music is indescribably awful.",1074729600,2,382,4.366197183098592
1328486,4,B00003ETJZ,"I am a beginning belly dance student.  I have six months of classes and the Neena and Veena instructional series under my belt, but I've done very little dancing for the past six months.  I got this DVD a week ago.  I like the fact that nearly all of the exercises are actual belly dance moves.  I haven't yet managed yet to make it all the way through the workout.  I am looking forward to using it to get back in shape and build my belly dance endurance.

The DVD opens with a display of the various products of Natural Journeys that feels really long.  The feature presentation begins with four background dancers dancing backlit.  They exit, and Rania dances forward as the lights come up.  Rania awkwardly introduces the tape, not quite sure what dance position she wants to assume in order to speak to us, or which smile to paste on her face.  Unfortunately, when she's not dancing, she seems to be constantly sorting out at least one of these problems.  After the introduction, we get a warm-up of arm movements and slow shimmies, then on to the workout.  There's quite a bit of repetition, with only a few moves, but there was enough variety to keep me interested, and it certainly kept my heart pounding.
Several people mentioned that they don't like Rania's choice of music for her fitness tapes.  I don't find the music intrusive enough to get me down during the workout, but it is bad...really bad.
I like the voiceover, which is fairly matter-of-fact.  She explains the moves briefly, but I don't really think you would want to use this tape unless you already knew how to do hip shimmies and shoulder shimmies.  I also felt that the background dancers frequently (and Rania occasionally) showed graceless armwork.
The special features include two bonus performances by Rania, a bonus waist-sculpting workout, and no-voicover option, a photo gallery, previews of other tapes by Rania & others produced by Natural Journeys.  I generally liked the performances, though Rania's blank, open-mouthed stare made her look exhausted.  I haven't yet decided how I feel about it the bonus workout.  I can't figure out its intended audience.  Rania shows you a few basic moves, with a little instruction.  It does not seem to be designed for someone familiar with these moves, but neither do I think that the instruction is enough for someone who does not know the moves.  The gallery shows Rania in her workout outfit and one of her performance costumes in various poses.",1072569600,5,2474,4.76056338028169
1328487,2,B00003ETJZ,"I purchased this video a while ago going by what the DVD cover said and I really had no clue who Rania was. The workout does make you break a good sweat that's why I am giving it 2 stars, however it is very repetitive, therefore it gets boring, not to mention the dancers in the back who lack gracefulness.
Rania did not impress me in her bonus performances. Belly dancing is a sensual dance, not a sexual one and she makes an erotic act out of it. She rates very low on her belly dancing skills and her instructions are annoying. Thank goodness there's an option to workout to the music without the narration.",1069718400,11,610,4.3130434782608695

I've been searching for different workout videos for a while, I just can't get myself to the gym between work and school so I do workout videos at home. After I did the other videos a few times I'd get bored with them and stop. This did not happen with Rania's videos. One important thing to realize is that these workouts utilize key belly dance movements in the workout **This is not an instructional belly dance set**. (If that's what you want I highly recommend Veena and Neena) If you are looking for a different low impact workout to spice up your routine, this is it. If you are looking for a workout that will help you improve your bellydancing by isolating important belly dance movements while execising, this is it. If you are looking to learn belly dance or a new routine, look elsewhere.",1067817600,14,990,4.662857142857143

I like her teaching style and the way she gives a breakdown for the movements.  Her dancing at the end is awesome.  I just don't understand the negative reviews of this wonderful set.  I have produced my own video tape -- and I give 10 stars to Rania's.  I wonder if the people who gave the negative reviews have produced their own tape???

1328501,3,B00003ETJZ,"This is a good video for beginners.  It starts out with an introduction to the hip drop moves.  Then the video moves into a routine which is completed through the entire video.  Each segment builds upon another segment unti you have a complete routine.  I enjoyed having a complete dance at the end of the video.  It moves slow enough and repeats each section enough times than anyone could master this dance, even on their first viewing.  I enjoy the fact that it creatse a choreography, because it helps me put together my own dances.  The Veena and Neena series, although excellent for learning, do not teach choreography.
The video had some problems, namely that the costuming, music, and setting were dull.  It has the style of an aerobics video.  However, this may make it more accessible to viewers coming from the aerobics world.  It has none of the new-age commentary one finds in Dolphina's videos, and some count this as a benefit.
I must say that I was disappointed that there was no true hip hop music in this video.  If real hiphop music was not going to be used, I would prefer to hear traditional Middle-Eastern music.",1058054400,3,1134,4.648241206030151

They all get your heart rate up although only one is high-impact. They feel more like dancing than exercising so they have held my intrest longer than most.  I recomend buying the whole set, you'll want to keep doing them because they're fun. These tapes are a fun way to include cardio into your workout while learning a few bellydance moves.",1054080000,,503,4.351063829787234

I own many bellydancing videos and have enjoyed all of them up until I bought this set. The only one worth keeping to me is the Cardio Shimmy, only because it will help strengthen the legs and improve the shimmy. Rania is an absolute beautiful dancer but these tapes were extremely uninspiring. These have some bellydance instruction to them but none of the moves are broken down and they are way too repetative--which is even worse because I didn't like the moves we had to keep repeating. The combinations weren't smooth and flowing. Ok, so I read the reviews and was warned that there was no Middle Eastern music used for the exercising, but thought that would be interesting and fun--WRONG!! Well, it would have been if it was great Latin, or Great Hip-Hop music as Rania said a couple of the videos were going to be worked out with. That music was dreadful. ... I also was very much annoyed by the facial expressions of many of the ones on the video, including Rania's. Rania does a bellydance routine of her own at the end of each tape and they are absolutely gorgeous to watch and I loved them.

I believe she will be able to create a great bellydancing program to workout to. If she does try some new tapes I will probably purchase them hoping she has chosen better music and a more variety of bellydancing moves that string together more beautifully. So, all in all... I would definitely recommend getting ""Cardio Shimmy"" and accompany it with other bellydancing tapes. ""The Sensual Art of Bellydance"" for beginners and then ""The Goddess Workout"" set for intermediate and a bit more are great videos. For more advanced, Suzanna DelVecchio has wonderful videos out but you will have to find them online on bellydance websites as they are not sold here. I wish they were.

As a bellydancer, and daughter of a 20 year certified bellydance instructor, I have to say Rania is one of the WORST professional bellydancers I have seen. I can't believe she has 10 years experience and other videos. She moves like a robot! As far as the workout, each tape has it's fun moments, but they don't last. Pure Sweat is like a bad salsa class with little to no bellydancing, Cardio Shimmy is no fun, Bellydance Boogie & Hip Hop Drop are enjoyable here and there, but the repetitive moves irritate me. The cueing is bad. Alot of the music is ""elevator""-ish. The warm-ups and cool-downs are lacking. This video set is fine if you don't know what bellydancing is SUPPOSSED to look like, but if you do, the mechanical movements can at times be distracting. These are definately for people who aren't serious about bellydancing and just want a different kind of dance workout.",1052870400,9,955,4.690476190476191
1328516,5,B00003ETJZ,"With well-chosen Latin music and a fast-tempo'd pace guaranteed to satisfy the aerobic-dance crowd, this is the most accessible entry in Rania's Bellydance Fitness for Weight Loss series. Travelling steps, such as the grapevine, the duck walk, swivel walk, with a little shimmy to boot are featured. The ""dessert"" at the end - Rania's playful Folkloric performance with veil and cane - shows how these travelling steps are used to advantage.
I firmly believe, though, that the sum of entire Bellydance Fitness series is greater than its individual tapes. Use Pure Sweat and Cardio Shimmy on your aerobic days, Bellydance Boogie when you want to really work on your torso moves, and Hip Hop Hip Drop on your yoga days and when you need to work out sore muscles. You need to master the elements in all the tapes, not just one, to become a well-rounded dancer.",1050624000,3,857,4.836734693877551

My two favorites are the Hip Hop Hip Drop and Bellydance Boogie. These are medium impact when it comes to intensity level. However her Cardio Shimmy and Pure Sweat I have not tried but have watched and they are high impact. Those I have yet to conquer. If you are looking for a good calorie burning fat burning workout within the bellydance world using the moves I recommend this set and definately go buy a coin hip scarf.

These workouts are FUN and you can really fill it working, plus they make you feel sensual and sexy!  Sometimes the moves are a little awkward at first, but with practice, you get the hang of it.  These tapes do not really teach you bellydancing, but instead teach you some moves that are used in bellydancing, so you should not expect that you are going to become an expert bellydancer with these.  I try to do two tapes a day, three days a week (I have added some other Veena/Neena & Rania tapes to my collection), and I have been keeping up with this routine for about 9 months, which is the longest I've ever been able to keep up an exercise routine.  Three of the tapes, do not offer much in the way of Cardio workouts, but are good for toning.  I have lost a little weight, and I probably would have lost more had I been more particular with my eating habits.  Overall, I think these tapes are great.

I just expected more of an actual hip hop sound (think of someone like Lauryn Hill) and more instruction on how to actually do the moves than was given. The workout itself was a weird combination of belly dance and pop dance moves which was not what I was expecting at all. I bought the DVD for the hip drops, not to learn how to dance!!  And is it just me or does Rania become a tad bit annoying with all the fake smiling? Just curious... Overall though, I would still recommend this DVD to someone who's looking for a decent belly dance inspired workout.

The other workouts are not as intense, in fact Bellydance Boogie is fairly mild. I have fun doing the workouts and I don't even notice the time passing. It did take me a bit of time to get the moves down. I also enjoy the bonus workouts included. The low point is the music, but I'm able to look past that.

I also like the way how she shows how to put moves together. While someone who is looking for just bellydance instruction would probably be unsatisfied with this video, if someone who is looking for a fun, stimulating bellydance based workout, this is great. I don't understand how anyone could think Rania can't dance well, she has been voted by her own peers as ""Bellydancer
of the Universe"" several times. This is a very motivating workout, and she has a sweet and unthreatening, yet confident style. I love the intensity of the ""Cardio Shimmy,"" I used to have a problem shimmying for any period of time, now I can do it with the best of them hehe. Personally, I like the fact that she is so beautiful and in shape, then I know it works well! Although I'm sure she does alot of weight training to get abs like that. I also love the Bidasha twins, especially the toning tapes and ""Sensual"" series, and Dolphina, I love her positiveness and spiritual outlook on exercise, although there are better bellydancers out there, she is still pretty darn good.
Also recommend Atea's videos, Slow Moves, Fast Moves, and Magical Motion, I love seeing dancing of all different styles on different body types, that way people can realize you can be beautiful and confident no matter what you look like :o)",1046908800,4,1425,4.658730158730159
1328524,4,B00003ETJZ,"The case features Rania (pronounced ""Ranya"" -- am I the only one who catches myself calling her ""Ranma""? :P ) in two costumes which aren't on the DVD.  There's a lo-ong intro from the producers, but you can skip most of it by clicking straight to menu.  Your choices are the main workout, a shorter upper body workout and two performance pieces.  There's also a photo section and trailers for other bellydance videos the producers have made.  There's no region code listed on either the case or the DVD, and I had no problem playing it on a ""stripped"" DVD player.
I confess the ""Wings of Isis"" performance was the sales clincher for me.  My girls love to watch clips from this spectacular performance and the full dance didn't disappoint.  Rania used ""Isis Wings"" props:  two sunburst-pleated semi-circular veils attached to her arms and to wands she held in her hands to extend the ""wings"" outward.  Her dance imitated the movements of real birds and was very exciting.  The other performance piece was a raks sharqui number set to a commonly-used Egyptian pop tune to contrast with the American cabaret style used in the other dance.  Rania is an incredible dancer and it's a real pleasure to watch her interpret the two different styles.
The stage for all the pieces is a set done up like the center court of a shopping mall or a talk show stage without the furniture.  I guess it was supposed to be Reassuringly American but I found its studied blandness a trifle annoying.  There are four backup dancers all with the same generic ""American nymphette"" bodies.  I hated the practice outfits used for the main workout.  Flat black looks good on some people including Rania; but three of the four backup dancers looked like they were about to keel over dead.
The main workout starts with a very short dance number by the backup dancers, then Rania announces they're going to be studying hip drop variations to hip hop music.  There's a warmup using basic bellydance moves like snake arms, hip drops and hip circles, then the workout begins.
Rania teaches a choreography which incorporates progressively harder variations on the hip drop as it goes along.  It's an American cabaret-style dance which IMHO shows some MTV influence.  Previewing it I saw that she used the same ""watch and follow along"" technique Neena and Veena used in their fitness videos, except her moves were more complex.  There was little discussion of  posture and none of where your weight goes.  I tried out the movements as they came up, but couldn't figure out how to do the more advanced variations at the end of the choreography.
Then I tried to do the workout.  Oh Goddess!  It quickly became apparent this workout wasn't for coordination-challenged among us.  With no previous dance experience and no discussion of balance and weight I can't even do the first step at speed.  I try to ""step sideways and do a front half hip circle"" and I'm listing like a ship in a storm.  But I turn off the DVD and practice, and by the end of the day I can sorta get it.  I'm currently working my way through this choreography at a few minutes every few days.
The short upper body workout uses bellydance moves in the warmup then progresses to a difficult gym exercise involving pushups and hyper extensions.  The photo section consists of additional shots of the same two outfits shown on the case (yawn).  The trailer are for the other DVDs in Rania's series and the two Bidashi series.  The four backup dancers are only present on the main workout; my 3yo was highly upset that ""her friends had to go home early and couldn't stay"".
I've heard a lot from experienced dancers looking for choreography tapes.  I can whole-heartily recommend this DVD, in fact this entire series judging from the trailers, to you.  And the two performance pieces are probably worth the price of the DVD, considering the high prices of most performance videos.  However if you're not interested in learning American cabaret-style choreography you might want to pass it up.  And if you're a rank beginner like myself you might want to put off buying it until you've got several months or a year under your hip belt first.",1045612800,9,4166,4.709944751381215
1328525,4,B00003ETJZ,"I got interested in bellydancing a month or so ago, but there aren't any classes in my area right now.  I was so sad. ;_;  But my mom bought me this video to cheer me up.  It's really, really fun!  The only real complaint I have is that sometimes the camera will point at the dancers' feet when I really need to  see what their hips are doing, and I get all confused and end up tripping. ^_^  But all in all, it's a great workout.  I'm really out of shape and like 50 pounds overweight, but I was still able too do all the moves, after a few rewinds.  This tape made it fun and easy!  So if you're looking for a workout that isn't boring or too difficult, you should check this video out!",1045526400,,688,4.0
1328526,5,B00003ETJZ,"I bought HopHop Hip Drop and was delighted enough with it to buy the entire set of Bellydance Fitness for Weight Loss, for which  I have posted a more comprehensive review.
Rania's pace is perfect and her approach works: she engages those who are not yet studying dance regularly, and gives us intermediate-level dancers a great workout. Also, if you suffer from sciatica, or know someone who does, working out with this tape is the most effective and efficient way to cure this stubborn problem, and by far the most inexpensive!
I appreciated that Rania gives a short performance at the end of the routine in full costume as a little reward. Her ""wings of Isis"" wowed out my workout buddy, who had never seen such spectacle before. I have seen better by other performers, but why gripe when Rania has produced a tape that TRULY WORKS IN PRACTICE, rather than a theoretical masterpiece?",1045180800,,886,4.753246753246753
1328527,5,B00003ETJZ,"I bought HipHop Hip Drop by itself, and was delighted enough to purchase the complete set! I am a dedicated amateur belly dancer with nearly three years of regular semiprivate lessons and have seen more than a few bellydance instruction tapes. So far, this is one of the best for my purposes, and here's why:
1) Production is professional, lighting is good, the array of smiling ladies in simple clothing, and Rania's direct and pleasant manner makes it easy on the eyes and the ears.
2) Rania strips down the workout to its essentials. She does not introduce terminology, she just has you do the moves, again and again, until you get it. Her pace of instruction is just right; occasionally, I have had to put the tape on ""pause"" to perform the move verrry slowly, but not very often. I would rather pause occasionally than suffer through terribly slow instruction, as we see in the front half of the Neena and Veena tapes.
3) I often work out with non-dancers of different fitness levels. This tape has been THE BEST of many I've tried in keeping my workout buddies engaged and involved, while I get a good workout and build skills myself. Once they feel confident about the workout, I show them how to adjust their stance and nuance their moves, and they're actually READY to listen to me! This is a tape that works, and transcends what ought to work theoretically.
4) As with any bellydance, it is a great lo/no impact workout. Rania chooses moves that teach basic moves, as well as develop the strength, coordination, and balance needed to bring your dance up to the next level.
5) HipHop Hip Drop should be recommended, standard practice for anyone suffering from sciatica. This is truly one of the most efficient and effective cures for this stubborn condition, and THE MOST INEXPENSIVE as well!
6) Bellydance Boogie's choreography may upset some longtime bellydancers with its emphasis on snake arms: it looked a bit like I was treading water, they went on so long. But wait - there's method to Rania's madness - a looong run of snake arms is just what is needed to build up the muscle strength to do them well. Rania also introduces moves to introduce floorwork, which she demonstrates quite admirably in the final segment.
7) I appreciate the length of the tapes, as well as the price.",1045180800,7,2294,4.680693069306931
1328528,1,B00003ETJZ,"Don't get me wrong, Rania is gorgeous and has a killer body, but this workout is misbilled as ""belly dance"" or ""hip hop."" The music is more New Age than Middle Eastern, and it sure isn't hip hop. The ""workout"" is boring, and there are almost no instructions, so if you don't already know how to execute the moves, you won't learn.
At least two of the backup dancers are much better belly dancers than the star is, and her plastered-on smile started to get on my nerves. It would have been better to have her actually talk to the camera rather than use a voice over, because there's no connection between her and the viewer. The flying camera was annoying too. How am I supposed to follow what the dancers are doing when the camera angle keeps changing? It seemed like they paid for this fancy expensive camera and wanted to get their money's worth, regardless of whether it added to or detracted from the presentation.
The performance at the end was okay, but not great. It didn't involve much real belly dancing, and the violent head snap she did repeatedly looked dangerous. (And pretty silly, after the umpteenth time she did it.) You could seriously injure your neck trying to do that move. It bothered me that a ""fitness"" video featured a potentially damaging movement.
This is not the first ""belly dance"" video I've seen that came out of this production company, and unfortunately, the flaws in this video seem to be part of the whole series. They hire beautiful women who are good dancers, but not the best *belly dancers*, and try to pass them off as superstars.

1328532,4,B00003ETJZ,"I bought this tape on a whim, and I don't regret it. It's a little less traditional than others, with more contemporary music instead of the Arabic/Eastern you'd expect, but good just the same. Rania and several other women of varying body shapes perform nice stretches at the beginning, similiar to all exercise tapes, then progress into steps, hip circles, hip drops, etc. From slow and easy to more difficult and faster, you'll feel it in your hips and waist. You'll learn the steps of a routine in sequence, and by the end of the tape you've learned a complete routine. The routine was fun, even if I was a little out of step, with a beginner level of exertion. Intermediate folks will probably find this too easy for a real workout, but perfect on their 'yoga-type' exercise days. The only thing I didn't like about the tape was the final dance Rania does afterward. It's a pretty dance, but I don't believe it demonstrates bellydancing in its best form. It demonstrates how much control she has of her abs for the most part. Either way, this is a fun tape and gives your hips, waist and thighs an especially good workout/stretch.",1043452800,2,1135,4.623762376237623

It's a wonderful more upbeat video to me than bellydance boogie.  And the performance at the end of the video with Isis Wings is just a wonder to behold.

Rania is a skilled bellydancer but her routines and workout don't seem to have the flavor and uniqness that Veena and Neenas had.  They seemed a little more enthusiastic about their workouts and their tapes are of a better quality.  Another thing that kinda bothered me about this tape is one of her back dancers.  The 2 white chicks just cant dance.  Im sorry, I actually had to laugh at them.
I think that the idea of bellydancing to different music is a great idea.  This set isn't worth the money if you cant stand bad music, just get bellydance boogie and hip drop hip hop(these are the best ones!).  Leave the other 2 on the shelf.",1040083200,4,864,4.245398773006135

7918529,5,B00003ETJZ,"My background is relevant to my opinions on this series: I took many bellydance lessons years ago - maybe a decade ago or so.  I haven't taken a single class since.  I enjoy the movements, but not for the sake of learning to perform, rather for me, they are are relaxing and invigorating the way that others might find yoga to be.  So I know how to safely execute most basic bellydance moves, and I simply enjoy the way it feels.  I also HATE exercising any other way - so I was really looking for a bellydance workout that primarily gave me a thorough, balanced, calorie burning, muscle strengthening, flexibility increasing, sweat producing, overall fitness-oriented workout.  You know: a workout that incorporated bellydance.  As another reviewer mentioned, that is very different from a lesson designed to teach you how to dance.  I think that is very important to remember.

I have tried Suhaila's DVDs and Neena and Veena, back when I was actually taking lessons.  Suhaila's were great as conditioning for bellydance, but I did not feel they gave me the best overall fitness workout (I don't think that was her intention, anyway - they are conditioning videos for dancers).  Neen and Veena were okay - they got me moving, but I think I got bored with them pretty quickly.  I used both sets for some time, but they didn't really hook me.  These do!  They are so much fun, and I just really love the moves - I also think Rania's fitness background and orientation really shine through.  These programs really are designed primarily to be a good overall (moderate) workout, based on bellydance moves.  They aren't going to drill certain techniques, they aren't going to give you the world's greatest choreography or Middle-Eastern music - instead, everything about these DVDs will just make you think ""workout!"", and they will be fun, not boring, if you love the way bellydancing feels :-)  Since I really don't like going to the gym, doing other forms of exercise, it's important for me to do something fun, that's the only way I'll stick to it - and these are so fun that I look forward to doing them, it doesn't feel like ""discipline"".  So I've saved a bunch of money by buying DVDs rather signing up for a monthly gym membership that I would not even enjoy using, and I can workout in the convenience and privacy of my home, whenever I want.  Since I personally am not looking to advance in my dance or learn to perform, rather I just want to workout using the skills I picked up years before, these DVDs are much preferred over taking a weekly class, again saving me money in the long-term.  For me, Rania's DVDs are a great investment (and yes, I own many others, beyond this series, to increase variety).

But if your interest is primarily in becoming a better dancer - maybe in very basic ways, like if you didn't know how to do certain techniques and Rania's instructions help you, that might work - otherwise, you're not going to advance in your dance, you're just going to practice some of the moves for long enough to really sweat and burn some calories.  Rania has other DVDs that are aimed towards teaching advanced dance and choreography - these are not them.

Some have complained about the voiceover.  I would say....I find some of her instructions to be helpful, but her cues often seem a little off to me - so I focus on moving in time to the music rather than her voice.  Some complain she seems stiff when she's not talking through the video, but relying on voiceover.  I think she looks fine.  The other advantage is you don't lose time while she explains moves, you just do them.  In other DVDs I have where she is talking things through, you lose some time while she is slowly demonstrating and explaining the move before bringing things up to tempo.

Biggest plus for me - I am finally back to working out, it's fun, and I can see and feel the effects in my body already!",1440288000,,3899,4.579250720461095
