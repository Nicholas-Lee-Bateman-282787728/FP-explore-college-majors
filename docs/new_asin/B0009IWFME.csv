2293338,4,B0009IWFME,"The Yoga videos I've looked at have been so boring.  This video covers the same types of stretches as Yoga but with a Ballerina's grace and movement so that you can actually enjoy what you're doing. Also, the work-out is only 10 minutes so it's ""do-able."" I wouldn't recommend this for people with back problems, though, that's why I knocked off a star.

2293339,2,B0009IWFME,"I have arthritis, including in my back and neck.  The moves she does would injure me if I tried them.  Her pacing is way too fast; to really stretch you must hold the stretch and she just runs through it like a dance.  The routine really is for a dancer, not a senior who has been sedentary which is how they advertise it.  If you're like me, try another video,like Keeping Fit in Your 50s.",1166140800,130,390,4.16

2293341,4,B0009IWFME,I would never have taken up stretching until my wife purchased Stretching for Seniors. I think the stretches Ann portrays are ones that almost any poerson can do comfortably. The exercises also are very graceful and make you want to be graceful along with them. I do them every morning and don't have the desire to find an excuse for not doing them everyday. I have never been a person who likes to exercise so Ann's program is exactly what a person like me needs. I urge you to buy it. The only reason I didn't give the DVD a five star rating is because I think that the material is organized in the wrong sequence. I think the insruction should have been first and the daily exercise routine second.,1154390400,98,701,4.4
2293342,5,B0009IWFME,"This 30 minute program is a great way for anyone to gain  strength and flexibility.  Ann Smith is a wonderful, easy-to-follow instructor and the music is beautiful.

2293343,1,B0009IWFME,This 30 minute DVD is really only a 10 minute program.  It is well suited for 17-year-old Olympic ice skaters and experienced ballet dancers.,1144713600,67,141,4.875

2293357,2,B0009IWFME,Not what I expected. This video was for my mom who is 74 and not as agile as this lady. She can't get down on the floor and do some of the stretches. This lady looks like she's been a dancer her whole life and is in good shape. It should state that this is for more physically fit seniors. I found a better option in chair yoga for seniors.,1496016000,3,340,3.8714285714285714
2293358,3,B0009IWFME,"Not sure if I received the right video - there were no instructions while doing the exercises - which was why I purchased this video.  I have never study ballet and while the movements were beautiful and graceful, I spent more time watching to see what I was suppose to do.  I really just wanted a video to walk me through stretching for someone in my age group.  Nice video and I'm sure someone who knows the movements will enjoy - just not what I wanted.",1495670400,2,456,4.27906976744186

2293360,3,B0009IWFME,This is a nice exercise DVD for folks of a mature age but there's too much time wasted on instruction. It should flow more smoothly.,1494720000,,132,4.32

2293374,1,B0009IWFME,This is quite possibly the absolute worst exercise/stretching DVD available.  Ms. Smith was apparently a dancer and is quite proud of it.  The DVD consists of her doing a stretching/dance routine with absolutely NO INSTRUCTION.  When she does give a slight explanation of the moves it is simply to tell you the difference between how a dancer moves as opposed to we more common people.  Not a total waste of money but very close.  Amazon should seriously consider removing this DVD from its inventory.,1486857600,3,501,4.916666666666667
2293375,1,B0009IWFME,"This video is marketed as being easy to do and appropriate for seniors.  After buying the video it certainly appears to me that Ann Smith was a career dancer of some sort, probably ballet, and what is simple and easy for her is WAY beyond what most seniors should be doing.  She also doesn't use a chair for the seniors to hold onto for balance.  This video is a disaster waiting to happen.  Senior people are going to get dizzy, stumble, and fall, and get hurt if they try to follow her exercises.  I think it would be ok for people who have strong sense of balance and have been doing exercises already, but NO WAY should beginner seniors attempt her exercises.",1485129600,3,663,4.401639344262295

I'm surprised by some of the comments from other reviewers who found the tape too difficult or hard to follow.  That has not been my experience. The music is gentle and beautiful, Ann does a fantastic job teaching each of the steps after the opening 10 minute routine, so that every day you just pop in the DVD and the workout begins.  Since there are a couple of minutes of musical introduction, I go through a Sun Salutation just to warm up.  I highly recommend this DVD to everyone, especially if you love ballet and beautiful music",1457395200,,614,4.304347826086956

2293400,5,B0009IWFME,"Thank you Ann Smith!  Finally an exercise video for an overweight, non-model, couch potato, senior citizen like me.  I can actually DO most of her stretching techniques, if my tummy doesn't get in the way :)  So what?  Move as far as you can.  Her moves are slow and well-explained.  The classical music in the background helps to relax and is conducive to make me feel as thin and graceful and Ann (well, in my mind's eye anyway).  A lot can be done sitting on the floor.  There is limited standing movement also.... unless you feel so-inclined to pirouette around your living room?  Not me, though.  Just perfect to get us ""veggies"" up and moving, get that blood pumping, get the heart circulating, just a tadbit. Just a good beginning.",1445126400,14,738,4.607692307692307

2293404,4,B0009IWFME,I liked this workout less than others I've tried. I'm 70 and can't do all the things she can do as opposed to other senior DVDs I've purchased. I will keep it though and keep pushing myself to see if I improve enough to do what she teaches.,1431907200,3,240,4.020833333333333

2293411,5,B0009IWFME,"Ann Smith is inspirational in her stetching video. Realize that you are trying to do as she does, and carefully and gradually getting closer to her example and not trying to compete with her.

2293413,1,B0009IWFME,This video is nothing more than a demonstration of Ms. Smith's vanity wherein she shows off her own flexibility and dance background.  It is completely useless as an instructional tool since she does not instruct.  It is up to the viewer to jump in as best she can . . pretty near impossible.,1412985600,2,292,4.490566037735849

It may be named ""Stretching for Seniors"", but anyone who enjoys calming music, and who benefits from stretching, can benefit from this routine.  As with any exercise, common sense has to be applied, so when any of the movements hurt, or just don't feel good, trust your body and know when to stop ... don't try to reach and/or bend as far as the instructor.  When she does some of her side movements, I bend only to the point where it feels comfortable, then I stop.

Good video. We recommend this to other people who wishes to properly do the correct way of stretching. As to the seller,I recommend this seller to other amazon buyer. Quick and responsive.",1283644800,,364,4.615384615384615
2293449,5,B0009IWFME,A great stretching workout that leaves you feeling refreshed and energized and ready for the day.  It is based on a dancer's stretching exercises and has very fluid movements that are gentle and yet effective.  Would recommend to anyone young or old or anyone who has difficulty with flexibility.,1280966400,,296,5.020408163265306
2293450,3,B0009IWFME,"I was a bit disappointed in this tape as I found it difficult to follow the movements without clearer direction.  I was looking for a video that contained more of the exercise type stretches done in ""Senior Stretching"" gym classes.",1280620800,,231,4.775
2293451,5,B0009IWFME,"This is a fantastic exercise routine for older adults!  The length and depth of the exercises result in a good workout on a daily basis.  The classical music is an incentive to finish the tape.  As a senior dance semi-professional, I find it valuable to keeping in shape. Dancers will love it!",1267142400,2,293,4.596153846153846
2293452,3,B0009IWFME,so I personally have not used the DVD.  But the person I bought it for said the exercises seems useful and beneficial.  She just wished the instructor had a slower pace to help her keep up.  I would say this is a great DVD for individuals that are in moderately good shape and are not struggling physically.,1264723200,,307,4.350877192982456

2293455,1,B0009IWFME,"I wish I had read the reviews before I bought it.  I watched it all the way through first and haven't really tried it yet, but it seems to be more ballet than instruction.",1253318400,6,171,4.029411764705882
2293456,1,B0009IWFME,"Stretching for seniors is a very unsafe video.  As I played it, it took several minutes before she started then they showed the music she played in the background, and then she tells us just follow along I explain later..........for real?  I turned it of immediately and will return it.",1245888000,10,286,4.7
2293457,5,B0009IWFME,I received the used video in exactly the condition in which it was reported to be. It worked well and arrived in good tome.  I am pleased with this purchase.  These stretches are exactly what I needed.,1238025600,12,201,4.405405405405405
2293458,1,B0009IWFME,I bought this for my parents last week!  We reviewed it together and just laughed at how ridiculous the routine was!  You couldn't even hear what she was saying during the routine!  The quality of the video was poorly done and so was the instruction!  it is definitely not for people in their 60's!!!!,1228694400,16,301,4.518518518518518
2293459,4,B0009IWFME,"This is a good beginning to stretching, especially for those seniors who are out of shape, but want to remain flexible.",1224892800,,119,4.714285714285714
2293460,5,B0009IWFME,"I really like this exercize program.  I us it every day.  OK - I'm 60 years old, 5'11' and weight 225 lbs.  Most of what she does I can not do completely but every day I do it a little more.  I am making progress and gaining flexibility I haven't had in 40 years.  Since I began this program I have gone on to yoga regularly and bicycling.  I feel great.",1207353600,27,354,3.915492957746479
2293461,5,B0009IWFME,"This is such a calming, effective and helpful DVD! I am not anywhere near as flexible as Ann, but even for this 58 year old non-dancer, the gentle, fluid stretches done to calming, classical music are a delight. She makes me want to dance! I am a fan of Ann's work and choose her every time over the more common exercise videos done at a frenetic pace to boisterous music. Thank you Ann for creating a soothing alternative that is so effective!",1204329600,38,444,4.426829268292683

2293463,1,B0009IWFME,"SAVE YOUR MONEY.  This is useless.  Ann Smith is not a good teacher.  ""Step-by-step -- easy to follow"",  NOT!!!  I found a different exercise DVD to be excellent.",1175472000,38,162,4.642857142857143
2293464,1,B0009IWFME,"I'm over 50, after reading an article in an airline magazine about Anne Smith, I thought I could benefit from stretching, I was expecting a progressive program to stretching. I assume that most seniors do not have much flexibility, so it would be very nice to have program that would introduce stretching in a very slow and progressive way. I was disappointed to find out that it is not the case, this DVD is not stretching for seniors but stretching for senior dancers or seniors that have been practicing some method to maintain flexibility. For the rest of us it can be even dangerous.",1175126400,82,588,4.663461538461538

8061545,2,B0009IWFME,"While Ann must have been a wonderful dancer, I can't imagine most seniors doing these exercises.  If we are to mimic her, her entire body should  be captured so that you can see the movements from head to toe. This is an awful tape. The quality is horrible.",1512086400,,257,4.333333333333333
