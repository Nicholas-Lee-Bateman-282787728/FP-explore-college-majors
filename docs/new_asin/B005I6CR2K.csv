8474284,3,B005I6CR2K,"This is one of the better videos in the Okinawan Karate&Kobudo Legends set that I have gotten.. The interview was good but it would have been nice to see more higher ranked students performing the kata.
Yagi sensei only does 1 kata on the dvd. It's from the re-opening of Shuri Castle. The quality of that video has a lot to be desired. Another thing that bothered me was the poor quality of the sound. It kept cutting inn and out.
These videos are interresting. I WISH that they would have put more quality into the work.",1355097600,,522,4.391752577319588
