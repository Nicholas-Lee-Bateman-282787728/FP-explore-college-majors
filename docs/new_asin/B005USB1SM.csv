Finally DC COOPER last testimony shows. It is amazing. Granted these shows are from the mid/late 90's, so I believe the quality is comparable with the time, technology and equipment. I enjoy every minute of it. If you are a royal hunt fan, DO NOT PASS THIS ONE. I love John West, but DC COOPER is the best vocalist as far as I am concerned for this genre of music. worth every dime.",1325289600,,558,4.224299065420561
8487106,1,B005USB1SM,"This is a real RIPOFF!  These concerts are NOT new, they are from 15 years ago.  They released it with a different name so people can get confused and end up buying like I did. The original concert was in VHS analogue format. Well, this one is Analogue as well they didn't even re-master it. The video it's not even in wide screen format. I converted my old VHS to DVD and they did exactly the same. They didn't add anything to it. SHAME ON YOU ROYAL HUNT for stealing people's money. Don't be lazy - release something NEW.  You should do it now that you called DC Cooper back in the line-up. No stars for you Royal Hunt. THE FUTURE COMING FROM THE PAST IS A RIPOFF.",1324944000,2,666,4.1875
8487107,3,B005USB1SM,"Neither of these two concerts have been available officially on DVD, so just for that, I give this set 4 stars. In truth, it's probably a 3.5 at best, as there seems to have been no effort to clean up the video. It basically looks like the VHS versions. They are also quite dark with lots of blue and red lighting, which doesn't help much. The picture is grainy and often shows many pixels during the darker scenes, of which there are many.  Sound is OK, but nothing special. Bottom line, if you're a RH fan, you need this DVD in your collection, just don't go expecting perfection!

EDIT: I've downgraded this to 3 stars. I'm really disappointed that so little was done (if anything) during the transfer process to improve the product. I mean, is it really acceptable with todays desktop technology to allow sound dropouts from the original source tape to remain??? Did they just pull an original VHS from their personal collection that had been sitting on a shelf for over 10 years and convert it straight to DVD? I expected better from Royal Hunt....",1324080000,7,1053,4.595744680851064
