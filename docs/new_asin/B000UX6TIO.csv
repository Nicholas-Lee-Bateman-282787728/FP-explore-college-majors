My boyfriend LOVES CSI: And I gifted this complete set to him for Valentines. He was so ecstatic! The smile on the persons face is worth so much more :)
Thanks Amazon!",1202083200,4,314,4.25
8215438,5,B000UX6TIO,This is my second CSI purchase - the first (CSI Miami) was less than top quality.  The CSI Vegas - seven seasons has been excellent.  The DVD's are top quality with no breaks or skips.  I am very pleased.  I would caution others to buy only US copies of DVDs or movies.  The imports can be of lesser quality as was the case with the CSI Miami DVDs I purchased.,1201392000,6,360,4.085714285714285
