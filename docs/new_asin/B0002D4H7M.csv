8426580,5,B0002D4H7M,"He's Marsupilami- the wonderfully wacky, wise-cracking whirlwind of nonstop hilarity with a tail that can turn into a swing, a spring- or anything! You never can tell what this hip-hop Houbster will be up to, so don't miss this collection of delightful escapades from the jungle's most gregarious gagster... the one and only Marsupilami! Houba!

In This Houba-Duper Volume:
""Marsupilami Meets Dr. Normanstein""
""Hole In Mars""
""Witch Doctor Is Which?""
""Safari So Good""
""Steamboat Mars""

I recommend this video to any true fan of classic Disney Afternoon cartoons.",1095984000,,561,5.363636363636363
