The title ""New World"" comes from the ""hostel"" that was opening up in Osaka that wants to cater to working class Chinese people, of which there are none visiting Japan. Coco is disillusioned by her trip, yet at the same time is an eye opener.

Economically China has replace Japan as a land of opportunity, a their economy is booming, while Japan was in recession. Economically Japan is now playing the prostitute to China, while all the while China still admires everything Japanese, hence the new world. The Japanese communist party ending was a bit confusing as if they were trying to tie the message all together, in case you missed it, or got it confused. I thought I had the message up to that point.",1462579200,,872,4.625806451612903

A warmed-over studetn film without a compelling character and no story to tell. I did not finish it. if a trascendent story emerges in the last 15 minutes it would be worth it. As an aside, the description is 1000x more compelling than the film. The description should be ""bored teenager takes revenge on her older boyfreind by stealing his credit card and travels to Osaka to be a bored teenager with a language barrier""",1393027200,6,532,4.552083333333333
