2996935,5,B000X1XA5S,"***UPDATE*** WARNING NORTH AMERICAN SHOPPERS *** DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!

This is a great miniseries, but only if you can actually watch it...

We purchased 3 copies of Year in Provence from this vendor in December 2013 via Amazon and have recently learned that these were Region 2 format (Europe), NOT REGION 1 NORTH AMERICA. It is true that the DVD format is given as Region 2 on the Amazon Page and failing to read every jot and tittle is MY bad.

But it is ridiculous that this company does not prominently list on a North American Amazon page which caters to North American customers that the DVD FORMAT BEING OFFERED WILL NOT WORK ON NORTH AMERICAN DVD PLAYERS. Ten months after making the purchase as Christmas gifts we can hardly expect a refund and are not asking for anything (except maybe an apology). BUT BUYERS BEWARE! The vendor might want to fix this issue.
**********************************

After waiting over 2 months for the ""pending"" release of the ""New"" version of this absolutely terrific 4-part series we wound up buying several copies of the ""Old"" version because we wanted them as gifts for people we know who love southern France, would like to go to southern France, or just love a good story.

These ""old"" version DVDs are identical to the edition we have had for a couple of years-originally shot in analog video in the early 1990s and put onto DVD, so nowhere near H.D. resolution, but perfectly adequate. Maybe part of the intent of a ""new"" version is to improve the image quality...but the best version of anything is the best one you can actually GET, and for now this seems to be it. These we ordered via Amazon; they had to come from England but the shipping costs were quite reasonable and they arrived here in the USA within about 1 1/2 weeks.

If you are okay with the above factoids, don't hesitate to buy this series. There is absolutely everything to love about the characters, the actors, the setting, and the story line.",1389571200,7,1965,4.648414985590778

8226694,5,B000X1XA5S,"*ASIN:B00IGAPNY4,PAL Format, Region 2, 2014 release. Two disc set, English audio and subtitles, no extras.

BEWARE of NEW Year In Provence! It is erroneously depicted and a CONDENSED version of this title with a runtime of 238 minutes instead of the correct 360! I know, I purchased and returned it ASAP.

A perennial favorite of mine, I never tire of it!
I've been watching this since it first aired on the A&E channel via VHS and their original DVD release.
I've never been satisfied with the mediocre quality of the DVDs though. I found the grainy low definition video very annoying. Dark areas were unstable, subtle flickering was obvious.
I let the people at A&E know how I felt but it wasn't acknowledged. And this is when their release was selling for $40 at my area Hastings Entertainment store, a number of years ago.

This newer 2014 BBC release is a much higher definition remaster but not a total restoration, there are occasional small scratches and blemishes but nothing truly disruptive.
I don't think this story will be restored until a  Bluray edition.
Audio quality is about the same as the old A&E product, very clear.

I've read some negative reviews regarding this production of A Year In Provence but I can find no reason for that. It is very professional and well done, I find nothing lacking about it.
The story itself is hilarious, whimsical at times.
John Thaw gives a sublime performance as the central character, Peter Mayle.
He is surrounded by a number of eccentric locals who defy description doing inexplicable things at times, just like Real Life which is the most entertaining thing of all!
So what's not to like?

This BBC release presents A Year In Provence by episode, one for every month instead of grouping them together in the four seasons like A&E.
The onscreen menus are quite nice and pleasant to use.
Runtime is equal to the original series, 360 minutes, no more and no less.
