8238005,3,B0010HP15Q,"This workout is supposed to be done using a special oblong ""core ball"" (which Hart sells). This needs to be mentioned in the product description.

Most of the exercises could be worked using perhaps a soccer-type ball (if you're not too heavy). Two of the exercises, the Mermaid and the Diamond push-up, she does with the ball, but you'd get a better workout not using the ball--it is used here as more of a support, rather than as a way to make the exercise more effective. Indeed, since it is oblong, rather than round, I think it is not as effective as using a round ball, since there is a lot less need to balance on it.

Another negative with this DVD is that there is over a minute of ads you can't forward through at the beginning. Plain annoying, especially when you're in a hurry to get to the workout.

8238006,5,B0010HP15Q,It was very well done and think I am a Leisa fan now.  She made me work hard  without thinking too much an even had some fun.  It's one of my favorite DVDs now and I am actually seeing some abs coming through!,1203120000,,209,3.813953488372093
