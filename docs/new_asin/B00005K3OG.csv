1615960,2,B00005K3OG,"Twice Told Tales was released in 1963 during an era in which the Anthology was quite popular and would remain that way until about the early 70s when they were being produced few and far between. Twice Told Tales stars horror legend Vincent Price and all 3 stories are written by Robert E. Kent based off the works of Nathaniel Hawthorne and all 3 segments are directed by Sidney Salkow who also worked with Price on The Last Man on Earth.

The biggest complaint when it comes to Anthology's is a lot of the times people feel the stories needed to be longer, but in the case of Twice Told Tales I felt the opposite, with 3 stories in 120-minutes they seemed to drag on a bit longer than they needed to be. Despite my rating I did enjoy Twice Told Tales, but I do feel as if the running time on each story could have been cut down a bit and while it wouldn't make this a classic of the genre it would make it more enjoyable.

The first story was Heidegger's Experiment and in my opinion was the best of the three. This story is about a potion that can restore youth and not only preserve a body in perfect condition, but can also bring them back to life. This one is mostly filled with talk, but it's quite interesting and the potion leads to secrets, betrayal and murder. I quite enjoyed this story a lot, but in all honestly it could have been cut down by a few minutes to help the pacing. But when all is said and done this was highly enjoyable.

The 2nd story was Rappaccini's Daughter; Price plays Rappaccini and he infects his daughter with a poison, so she can never leave the garden and anything she touches dies. A young Brett Halsey also stars. Like the first story, this one tends to drag in some areas and while editing would have helped the pacing unlike the first story it wouldn't help that much. Rappaccini's Daughter is a good story, but also kind of boring at times. This one has Romeo and Juliet type ending and again is good, but slightly boring and a little on the slow side at times.

The last story is The House of Seven Gables and was probably the most interesting of the three, but doesn't quite work; it's slightly slow paced and at times just not that interesting where as other times it is very interesting. This one though is growing on me after another viewing or so, I would possibly rate this higher.

Overall Twice Told Tales is a fun Anthology, but has some pacing problems I would recommend this to those who like Anthology's and or Vincent Price. It's a decent watch, but doesn't hold up as well on repeated viewings in my opinion. The biggest problem really is the pacing. Like I said most complaints with Anthology's is the stories need more time where as in this one, they might have been better off with a lesser running time; Still worth checking out at least once.",1227052800,5,2805,4.365900383141763
1615961,3,B00005K3OG,"Though the three stories contained in this collection are by no means good adaptations of the original sources,they are still worth viewing if only to watch the incomparable Vincent Price. The stories here are very loosely adapted from the works of Nathaniel Hawthorne.

The first story ""Dr Heidegger's Experiment"" is perhaps the best of the three - it centers around two old friends who suddenly find the source of life and youth dripping from the ceiling of a crypt. Before long, the two friends restore their youth and also bring a long-dead corpse back to life but discover that some things are best left as is. ""Rappacini's Daughter"" is the weakest of the three - Vincent Price stars as Dr Rappacini, whose possessiveness of his daughter goes to literally toxic lengths with predictably tragic consequences. The plot here was rather plodding and lacked credibility as the story felt rushed through.

Finally,in ""The House of the Seven Gables"", Gerald Pycheon returns to his cursed ancestral home much to the chagrin of his estranged sister and the horror of his wife, who senses a strange affinity to the place. This story would have played out a lot better if it were not confined to the ridiculous length of abt 35 minutes [imagine an entire novel being shortened into a short story] and everything plays out so quickly and abruptly that the story ends up being more of a farce than true horror.

All in all, I'd recommend this to fans of Vincent Price and those who get a kick out of the classic horror movies of yesteryear.",1225411200,3,1532,4.773584905660377

1615965,2,B00005K3OG,"This is an obvious attempt by another filmmaker to copy the success of the Roger Corman/American International/Edgar Allan Poe tales starring Vincent Price.  They even went so far as to cast Price in the lead role.  The anthology of three tales based on the works of Nathaniel Hawthorne is worth viewing, but you have to be a determined collector of gothic horror flicks to take an interest in this one.  The movie suffers in comparison with the Poe product.  Instead of Corman's creepy camp worthy of multiple viewing, we have straight-faced tales of the supernatural.  The first story, ""Dr. Heidigger's Experiment"" fares the best.  Price and Sebastian Cabot discover the secret of rejuvenation and resurrect Cabot's love of 38 years ago.  Instead of a dusty skeleton in a grungy gown, we now have a dishy blonde in a plunging negligee.  Combined with the color photography and period detail, the mood here begins to resemble the heaving bosoms of Hammer.  ""Rappacini's Daughter"" plods along, slow paced and poisonous, with its tragic romance.  ""The House of Seven Gables"" tries to capture the mood of the classic novel, but it only achieves modest results before it collapses on itself.  The supernatural overtone of the stories is subdued.  Vincent Price grimaces and tries to look tragically sorrowful.  The no frills Midnite Movies edition of the DVD includes the original trailer, but no bonus extras.  Proceed at your own risk.  ;-)",1022716800,28,1439,5.038135593220339

However Vincent Price is always a pleasure to watch and he has a great cast to work with including Sebastian Cabot, Bret Halsey, Richard Denning, Mari Blanchard, Beverly Garland and Edith Evanson. The sets by Charles Thompson, art designs by Franz Bachelin and colorful cinematography by Ellis W. Carter were very effective. ""Dr. Heidegger's Experiment"" was my favorite tale.

The third is a shortened and, therefore, slightly altered version of The House of Seven Gables. All are worth seeing more than once, but take care about letting small children watch them.

1616025,4,B00005K3OG,"Another [1963] Vincent Price anthology! This one with Hawthorne short stories.
The first story, which also stars Sebastian Cabot is the scarier of the three: a
body that comes back to life. The two guys go into a tomb, noticing, after the
casket slides aside, that, inside, is still moist and not decayed at all, after the
pass of a decade.
The second story has a horror-able garden, with plants that kill people.
The last one is an abbreviated classic story which---in 1940---also, stared Price...
about a legendary house and a cursed family...""HOUSE OF THE SEVEN GABLES""
Vincent Price is in all three, with co-stars such as Richard Denning... Mari Blanchard...
and Brett Halsey.
I remember seeing this when it was new... and I was too. In 1963---52 years ago---I was
14, and probably more interested in MONSTERS than girls... three marriages later, I
discovered that sometimes girls A=R=E monsters!

Such as we have three tales with Vincent in the lead role. I am a huge fan of Vincent Price, so, I have had this DVD for quite sometime when I got it as this Midnite Movies edition. There is only the Theatrical Trailer as an added bonus, but most of these titles under Midnite get the same treatment on DVD.
The image and sound are good for a DVD release and the picture appears clean for the most part. Menu has easy selections.
The first one with Sebastian Cabot (""Family Affair"" for those of you old enough to remember) is my favorite of the bunch.
The second has a gal that literally has poison running through her veins and everything she touches (reminds me of Rogue in X-Men) instantly dies.
The third is The House of Seven Gables. This tale I can't help but think of ""The Fall of The House of Usher"" because the houses or mansions literally collapse on themselves at the end.
At times Vincent looked as if he was trying hard to be sad, remorseful, or whatever he felt from the Corman/Poe movies.
I like it, but it's not one of his very best.
The Tales were written by Nathaniel Hawthorne.

1616029,3,B00005K3OG,"Although not as popular as Poe, it could be argued that Nathaniel Hawthorne was as influential as his for famous peer. Unfortunately, while Poe was given a series of respectful adaptations by Roger Corman in the sixties, AIP's attempt at the short fiction of Hawthorne falls well short of the standards set by Corman's work.

This anthology film includes adaptations of three very good stories: ""Dr. Heidegger's Experiment"", ""Rappaccini's Daughter"", and ""House of Seven Gables."" The last is one of the author's most famous novels and it's often considered a classic of American literature.

Each story has similar elements to the Poe series, but they lack Corman's panache and seem to have subscribed to a rather garish set design. The film seems less interested in scares or tension and more preoccupied with melodrama. The first story fares the best, featuring a few nice story twists and a bit of a bitter-sweetness that could've been a classic in more skilled hands. The other stories are okay; the last story is the weakest as it tries to condense an epic novel into a half-hour or so.

About the only allure this film has is that it is well acted (Vincent Price times three) and has some excellent flourishes in the set design. But this is weak care compared to the Poe cycle and even comes off as a bit of a bore when compared to Haller's misguided, insane Lovecraft films. I gave it three stars since that's how many excellent Price performances we get.",1405987200,,1461,4.7896825396825395

1616052,3,B00005K3OG,"There is no doubt that Vincent Price was the master at acting in horror movies. I have written in a couple of previous movie reviews in Amazon that a bad Vincent Price movie is still better then most of todays movies. A good case in point of that is ""Twice Told Tales"". Based on three short stories by Nathaniel Hawthorne Vincent Price stars in all three stories. None of these stories are bad, in fact these stories represent some of the best works as a writer by Hawthorne. The stories however in this movie are just not well scripted which makes the stories uninteresting. Also a lot of the acting in the movie is second rate at best. Except for Price who as always gets into his character and always seems to enjoy whatever part he is playing.

The first of the three is ""Dr. Heidegger's Experiment"". It is considered the best of the three stories in ""Twice Told Tales"". Sabastian Cabot co-stars with Price in a tale of a fountain of youth that starts to restore both of them back to their youths. It also brings forth a corpse in a wedding dress. It is a decent story. The second story is ""Rappaccini's Daughter"". By far the least interesting of the three stories. Price stars as Rappaccini who is an overly protective father of his daughter. The daughter tries to resist her overly protective father wanting to live life and falls in love with a young man she meets. Rappaccini of course tries to stop the budding romance which leads to a fateful ending. The third story is one of Hawthorne's most well known short stories, ""The House Of Seven Gables"". This one was I think the best of the three though still not up to par. One reason is this is a shorten version of the story. It still shows Price at his acting best but if you are interested in seeing ""The House Of Seven Gables"" done right I suggest you get the full length version of this short story starring Vincent Price and George Saunders made in 1948 and released by Universal.

All in all I would not recommend this film except for someone who is, like me, a big Vincent Price fan and is interested in adding this to their video library.",1371600000,,2104,4.434108527131783
