2317241,2,B0009S2KEM,"sigh...at least it was better than 'Zombiez'...

1) ACTING: Pretty much, it was hit and miss. Some of the actors were okay, and some were pretty rough. The lead character needed to be played by someone with more acting experience. He would've have been okay as a supporting character, but as the lead (who was also a scientist) he wasn't convincing.

2) PRODUCTION: This was filmed on whatever is the next film machine up from a camcorder. Some dark scenes not lit really well. So-so soundtrack, no heavy metal music, but some hip-hop songs here and there. I enjoyed the ""stunt phone."" It seemed whenever a cell phone needed to be dropped, it was always the same kind that hit the ground, even though we would see different cell phones with different characters at the time of use.

3) ZOMBIES: Snyder runners all the way. Nothing new here, except zombie-Jermaine remains loyal to his brother when he is attacked by another zombie. ""Love transcends all bounderies""...?

4) SPECIAL EFFECTS: Mad scientists with Mountain Dew in a beaker just doesn't cut it. The gore wasn't too bad, but reaching UNDER people shirts to gut them should only be used once or twice. Some of the budget should be spent on at least one good gut tearing scene. (IT IS a zombie movie, for pete's sake!) Having victims being attacked and seeing the aftermath of the victims just laying there with blood on them doesn't work either. (or, at least, not in abundance) And God forbid, I realize that white t-shirts show off the best blood, but when the majority of the cast is wearing them and then dying, it becomes noticable. (It was like the ""red shirts"" from 'Star Trek.')

5) THE CAUSE: Man made experimental formula, trying to revitalize dying cells.

Overall, a pretty typical lousy zombie movie. I realize that zombie movies are a plentiful bunch lately, but there should be no excuse for mediocrity.

RATING: 2 out of 5.",1193875200,,1898,4.716012084592145
2317242,1,B0009S2KEM,"Hood of the Living Dead (The Quiroz Brothers, 2004)

It is only the fact that I saw Venice Underground and the remake of The Wicker Man in the same weekend as this that stops Hood of the Living Dead from garnering the title of Worst Movie I've Seen So Far This Year. I mean, this is abominable-- it's bad filmmaking without any of the benefits of Midnight Skater. In fact, I cannot think of a single thing to say in this movies defense except that it's not Venice Underground or the remake of The Wicker Man.

In what passes thinly for something that may have at one time resembled a plot, Scott (Chris Angelo) and Ricky (Carl Washington, who has the bad fortune to have starred in both Quiroz Bros. And Daniel Zirrilli movies within a year of one another-- surely the kiss of death for any aspiring actor) are scientists working for Dr. Richards (Solo por Hoy's Victor Zaragoza) on a formula to speed cell regeneration. When Scotty's brother Jermaine (Dope Game 2's Brandon Daniels in his second appearance on film) is killed in a drive-by, Ricky and Scott use the formula on him. When it doesn't seem to work, Jermaine is taken away in an ambulance, and Ricky vows revenge on the shooters, recruiting Jermaine's gangsta-wannabe friends to gun them down. Which would normally start a gang war, but not here-- the formula did work, turning Jermaine into a zombie who's bent on his own revenge-- turning the shooters into zombies. Yes, I'm serious. Zombie gang wars, folks.

Actually, think about it-- that would have been a pretty funny concept. However, the Quiroz Brothers never pick it up and run with it, instead focusing on the scientists and their hired-mercenary help trying to survive the zombie onslaught. (Read ""onslaught"" here as ""a handful of easily killed walking dead people"".) It's no-budget silliness, but as Midnight Skater showed, no-budget silliness can be great if you've got a meaty script and some original ideas. Hood of the Living Dead has neither; it stumbles into every convention there is and does nothing at all original with them. *",1173744000,4,2061,4.76750700280112
2317243,1,B0009S2KEM,Hood of the Living Dead eh? some friends of mine rented this movie  based off the title of the movies alone. they thought it make a hell of a good movie to end the night and laugh our asses off. Well this wouldve been great but they tried a bit too hard on this one. I mean come on...i know you're trying to make a movie here but lighten up a bit. Its so serious its funny. The acting is terrible. The make-up isn't the worst but its not good either. Its kind of funny because its so bad. I think i was the only one that stayed awake and watched the whole thing. Anyways if you're looking for a decent movie to laugh at and make fun of here it is. Hell I love horror movies and I had some fun watching it...corny jokes were all said to myself but oh well. Rent it just to make fun of it. Have fun zombies,1145232000,6,804,3.902439024390244
2317244,1,B0009S2KEM,"Just because this is a B-Movie doesn't excuse the fact that it contains sub par acting, bad special effects and a serious lack of direction. I like a good zombie flick like the next horror buff. But I will not excuse this movie's weaknesses merely on the basis that it is a B- Movie. Even though this is a low budget film the viewer still expects to be mildly entertained. This film was just downright atrocious. George Romero's movies were made on a very low budget as well and they turned out to be cult classics.

If a movie is low budget and the acting isn't the greatest than it should atleast beef up on the writing and plot. This movie fails miserably at that. I don't understand how anyone could give this a five star rating not unless they were brain dead or trying to mislead someone into throwing their hard earned money on this waste of time film.

Sorry, but this film is a low blow to the zombie horror genre.",1140566400,5,923,4.329479768786127
2317245,5,B0009S2KEM,"I read these reviews and I'm forced to wonder what people expected when the rented a movie called `Hood of the Living Dead'.  I mean, James Cameron clearly had nothing to do with this one.  It was shot on a very small budget and that was apparent from the cover.  We live in a great time when a 20 year fan of the genre that is `zombie' can walk in to a video store and rent a new zombie movie once a month.  We all know that one way to kill a zombie is to remove the head or destroy the brain.  However, my fear is that zombies will be rendered extinct by bad reviews.

If you like zombies, you will like this movie.  It has that feeling of impending doom and apocalypse that made the genre successful in the first place.  The gore is not top-notch, but it is very passable.  It's racial (as should be expected) without being racist.  Zombies don't care about color, and that seems to be an underlying theme that runs throughout the movie.  The characters are believable, and there are very few plot flaws.  The movie has plenty of laughs without losing its generally serious tone.  And there's even homage to George Romero.  You can't have a zombie movie without borrowing from Romero's original; it's nice to see that acknowledged.

`Hood of the Living Dead' is an enjoyable movie.  It does not rival anything ever in theatres for best special effect category, but let's face it, most zombie movies don't.  If you're a fan of the genre, check it out, if you like big budget, move along.  Just don't try to dissuade others who might not have unrealistic expectations of a B-movie.  The zombie species is currently thriving, but they need audiences as well as human flesh.",1140134400,5,1673,4.462046204620462
2317246,1,B0009S2KEM,"First off, any five star review for this film is laughable and it only leads me to believe that A)We weren't all watching the same movie or B)Somebody must have been paid to rate this deplorable excuse for a film.

The writing was pathetic and seems as though it was done by a first grader. And on top of that, there were points where one of the Z-list actors disappears for a whole thirty minutes and reappears as a zombie and you didn't even see him get attacked in the first place.

I don't even have to tell you that the acting was horrid or the budget was low as you can tell that by the title of the film and the fact that there were only about 8 zombies throughout the whole film.

To sum up, this movie was a hot ""surface of the sun"" mess that should have never graced the markets of Amazon.com.",1138838400,4,803,4.134615384615385

2317248,1,B0009S2KEM,"Need I say more? It looks like it was shot on a camcorder. The acting is so awful you have to see it to believe it. If you can sit thru this movie (I played it like 4 times but ended up house cleaning or checking email and just letting it play) then you must be either in a coma, or related to someone involved in this film. How in the world are they charging $20.00 to buy this movie. Get a video of your next rectal exam, and watch that for a better production value.

8066017,1,B0009S2KEM,"This is a pretty lousy movie.  The people who gave it 5 stars have to be the makers, others who participated in it's making, or their mothers. This isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's in the same 'hood.  The blooper out-takes are so much more entertaining than the movie is.  The story is an uninspired ""life in da hood"" story, but with zombies, to make it more marketable. These guys deserve some credit for the effort, and the basic story idea could make a good film, but this ain't it.  It does have a few decent moments, especially in the second half, when it gains some momentum, but unless you're willing to look for the best in this pathetic, mostly amateur little movie, don't waste your money or time.  I got it for a penny, plus S+H and lost a mere 90 minutes of my life to watch it. I'll chalk it up to experience and move on with my life now.",1289606400,2,865,4.218181818181818

There is no spit and polish to give the impression that any effort was made on this film.  If the filmmakers do not make any effort to churn out a watchable movie, then I'm not going to go through the effort of recommending it.",1281657600,2,483,4.1063829787234045
