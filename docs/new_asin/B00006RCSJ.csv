Here's the problem: the film stopped playing about 18 minutes in. I tried it on multiple DVD players to be sure that it was the disc and not players. I had been waiting to see this film for YEARS so I was VERY disappointed when I got it and was unable to finish it.",1427328000,,381,3.8974358974358974
7972460,5,B00006RCSJ,"This could have easily been a movie of the week on network TV. There is very minimal profanity and is very touching. Judy can act (who knew?), and is very funny without ""trying to hard.""
The entire cast did a great job. It's a small film, but with a big punch. Some of the scenes were so truthful, it hurt at times to watch it. Judy was very sincere, and I totally believed her in this role. Great cameos throughout the movie. It is like an demented version of Sunset Blvd and Andy Warhol's Heat. If you liked those movies, you will certainly enjoy this one. I rented it (very hard to find in a rental capacity here in Orlando), but plan to buy it. It's a small cult-classic-to-be. The addition of Dana Plato's cameo added resinence and punch to the themes and plot lines. I can't say enough about this movie. It is worth it, and more. Bravo!",1060992000,4,842,4.30188679245283
7972461,4,B00006RCSJ,"I won't repeat what the other positive reviwers have said. This is a cute movie. What surprised me is how great Judy can act. She is funny, touching, moving, and gives a great performance. I think most of the people who will buy it will be Judy fans. While I was expecting more ""raw"" Judy, it was a pleasant surprise to see her much more mellow. Many fans will be disappointed to not see Judy being as acidic as usual, but you have to give her credit-SHE IS A GOOD ACTRESS. If you want the bitchy Judy, BUTCH CAMP is the DVD for you. Otherwise go into this with an open mind and enjoy her sweet and inspired performance.",1060905600,4,620,4.218487394957983
7972462,5,B00006RCSJ,"What can I say? It's a very funny, very cleverly written, very well-acted film, with lots of laughs, lots of surprises, lots of heart. I've enjoyed it over a dozen times. My friends have all loved it too. It seriously is one of the best comedy films of the past few years.",1060905600,4,272,4.25
