8508721,3,B000KC82DU,"Personally, I loved this series. It's childish, yet serious, and expresses the necessity of Family, and Freindship. The price for one disc is astronomically high for what you get. I don't believe in paying a fortune for just one disc. I'm afraid I'll have to give this one a bad rating. Sorry, Amazononites.",1248739200,7,307,4.811320754716981
