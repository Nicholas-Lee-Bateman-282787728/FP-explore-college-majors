6014934,5,B00FMR66J0,"Hahaha! That was awesome!

Usually I'm not a fan of musicals, but this was pretty cool. I've been a fan since season 1 and have seen every single Psych episode, so naturally, I just had to see Psych: The Musical. I loved the dance scenes and the rounds and Sean's dad is just plain awesome. Highly recommended. Any Psych fan will love this!!",1387152000,,341,4.412698412698413
6014935,5,B00FMR66J0,"I have never seen an episode of Psych, but my wife and son love the show, and we all watched the premier of Psych the Musical tonight.  I really loved it.  The music was very catchy and much better than what one typically hears in a new Broadway musical. Everyone in the cast was excellent, very talented and funny. I loved the show-within-a-show, where they did a musical based on Jack the Ripper (which was also a very funny bit from This is Spinal Tap.)",1387065600,5,456,4.352941176470588
6014936,5,B00FMR66J0,"I cannot speak for any of the potential 'Extras' but the Musical itself, is off-the-charts fantastic. I had the pleasure of seeing 'Psych: The Musical' during the 2013 San Diego Comic Con premier and it was by far, the highlight of the week. I have seen every episode of 'Psych' at least 2-times, and while most shows start to fade after 4-5 seasons, 'Psych' has actually improved. I was initially nervous when I heard the idea of a Psych musical, but the cast and crew absolutely blew me away. The vocal talent of all involved, Corbin Bernsen aside, was the biggest surprise. Scratch that, the 2nd biggest surprise.... the return of a fallen (Stabbed, then Fallen) 'hero' had the crowd cheering. The show is broken up into 2 parts, but are seamlessly tied together into one cohesive story line. As a fan of non-traditional musicals (Dr. Horrible, Repo!, Todd and the Book of Pure Evil S02E10) I cannot recommend this any higher. If you are into Psych, the musical is near-perfect however, if you are coming in blind, there are a lot of jokes you WILL miss out on. Watch the first 100+ episodes before diving in here. I was even a little confused going in as I had seen up through the Season 7 finale and the Musical, takes place somewhere before S07E07. Can't wait for my copy to arrive!

Buy this! You know that's right!",1386547200,71,1322,4.578059071729958

6015022,5,B00FMR66J0,"There have been whispers for years.  Then it was a sure thing.  Then the hype started.  Finally, the world was treated to the best singing and dancing murder mystery in December 2013.  Im talking, of course, about psych: The Musical.  And two days after it hit airways, its already hit DVD.  Rush out and buy it.

In fact, if youve been wanting to get into this show but were afraid of being lost after seven seasons this wouldnt be a bad place to start.  While a former villain plays a major role in things (and makes references to previous appearances), the first song gives much of the set up for the show.

And what is that set up?  Shawn Spencer (James Roday), is a thirty something clown who has found a way to use the super observations skills drilled into him by his father, former cop Henry (Corbin Bernsen).  Instead of becoming a cop like his dad, he pretends to be a psychic and helps solve murders for the Santa Barbara police department.  In on the charade is his best friend and partner in crime solving Gus (Dule Hill).  While his now girlfriend Juliette OHare (Maggie Lawson) believes him and Captain Vick (Kirsten Nelson) goes along with things because of Shawns results (while being skeptical at times), its Chief Detective Lassiter (Timothy Omundson) who is openly disbelieving in Shawns ability.

Which brings us to this case.  Zachary Wallace Zander, aka Z, (Anthony Rapp) has escaped from the psychiatric prison where hes been held captive for seven years.  He was arrested after killing a critic of his new musical play about Jack the Ripper and by locking him in the theater and setting it on fire.  The only person who can help them track this danger man down is Yang (Ally Sheedy), a serial killer that Shawn and Gus have tangled with before.  But will she provide them real clues or is she toying with them again?  Can they catch Z before he kills again?

Now fans of the show are already yelling at my description of the set-up.  Before you watch this episode, just know that it was originally filmed and designed to air during the recently completed seventh season.  The fact that it was held until December for a big event means that a few things that happened late in season seven haven't happened yet.  Know that going in, and youll be fine.

What this show always does brilliantly is combine mystery with comedy.  In fact, I often think of this show as a comedy more than a mystery.  That combination is in perfect unison here.  Yes, there is a mystery.  Yes, we want to know how Shawn will solve it and what is really going on.  However, there are so many great moments, lines, and gags that I was laughing the entire way through.  While season seven wasn't the strongest for the show, this two hour movie is the perfect example of just how wonderful the show can be when it is working on all cylinders.

What about the singing and dancing?  Im glad you asked.  Yes, they do set it up a bit as to why the characters are treating this as a musical, however, most of that doesnt come until the end.  Either way, by the end of the first song, I didn't care  I was already having that much fun.  The cast is very talented and they pull off the singing and dancing without missing a beat.  The first two songs are brilliantly funny, and there are some other classic moments later related to singing and dancing.  The only cast member who doesnt participate in the musical part is Corbin Bernsen, and according to him, thats a good thing for us.  Ill just take his word for it, but even his non-participation gives us a laugh.

Casting a Broadway star as the main suspect in this episode makes sense, and Anthony Rapp fits into the world of psych perfectly.  While I wasn't always a fan of the original Yang episodes, I did enjoy seeing her again here.  And the rest of the guest stars are good.  The main cast is great as always.  They are once again obviously having fun, and thats translates perfectly for us.

This DVD contains not only the two hour episode itself (well, 88 minutes if you don't count the commercials), but also includes a CD of the soundtrack.  Not bad for the price of a movie.

So if you are looking for a light musical comedy with murder (and who isnt?), be sure to check out psych: The Musical.  Youll be laughing and tapping your toes before you know it.",1434240000,,4310,4.4653846153846155

6015059,1,B00FMR66J0,"I am a huge fan of Psych overall. I would give the rest of the series an overall 5 star rating. However, this episode, being the final episode available on Netflix at the time, was a major letdown... and had it not been for the promise of seeing an 8th season reconcile the almost unthinkable travesty that this one singular episode constituted, I would have been utterly flabbergasted that such a great show could have crash landed so horribly in what seems to have been an instant. Although this episode was not just horrible because it was a bad episode... it was horriblebecause it was a prolonged bad episode... they unbelievably prolonged the suffering I felt while watching this out for nearly 90 whole minutes... a feature-length fest of unbearable awkwardness...

This review does not come as a pleasure for me to write. I honestly was in denial for a bit after the episode ended... that what I just saw could not have been as horrible as I was feeling it was... but my mom, who is also a huge fan of the show, also told me that she hated that episode so much so that she was compelled to go online and leave comments about how disappointed she was.

I usually don't put much time or effort into expressing my disdain for bad television, but this has for some reason been bothering me for two days. I would not be surprised if this episode alone singlehandedly ended not only the appeal of the show, but the promising careers of most of its cast members. It was that bad. I don't see how they didn't sense that in the production or the final editing of this botched abortion... after seven seasons of near perfection... to settle upon THIS load of utter rubbish as a top off to their second to final season topper.... it almost makes me wonder whether just about everyone involved in the production of this absolutely uncharacteristically terrible creation of theirs was not hammered on some sort of substance which turns its users into tediously mediocre bores...

Unbearably awkward, tediously mediocre, absolutely unnecessary, and one of the most potent career suicides I have ever seen a cast simultaneously commit in my whole life.

I will cautiously watch season 8 in hopes that it may in some small measure calm the raging displeasure I feel towards the whole franchise at this moment, but in all honesty it would take probably a whole 7 more seasons of its previous perfection in order to come close to undoing the absolute devastation that this one so-called ""special"" has done to the previous highly-esteemed name to which Psych had been once known.

Shame on you, Steve Franks, James Roday, and Dule Hill, for being blind to your own limitations. If it ain't broke, don't BREAK IT!!!",1415750400,3,2703,4.694092827004219

This show is about psychics, about detective work, deductive reasoning, crime, comedy, and many other things, but above everything else, it is a show about best friends.

6015134,4,B00FMR66J0,"It was a skillfully executed, talented and fun production with impressive singing from everyone....given a choice however, I'd still watch a non-musical 2-episode version of this show than a musical which is strange because I really like their singing and look forward to episodes where they get to sing. Maybe I wasn't watching at the right time and place...and perhaps the singing takes a little bit away from the reality of their characters as it tends to add more vulnerability. I'd still recommend it highly. If you like Psych, it's a must watch of course.",1392768000,,561,4.91578947368421

6015138,4,B00FMR66J0,"I think the hype about it was bigger than the production.  I was hoping for a little more of a Chistmas theme, Maybe something a little more Christmas Carolish, and yes it was funny as Psych usually is and the idea that everyone was breaking out into song gave it a real sparkle.  The vocalists weren't as good as they were making it out to be.  But I will watch it again.",1392422400,,372,4.138888888888889

6015140,5,B00FMR66J0,"I admit on first watching I didn't love it. I wasn't feeling it, didn't find it particularly funny, nor the singing to be spectacular. I think I'd set my expectations too high. I'm not really sure what possessed me to watch it again except that I wondered if maybe I was just not in the right mood the first time. See, I love musicals. I love Psych. I've loved all the musical psych-outs. I've loved the episodes that have featured a song and dance or two, so I couldn't figure out how this episode had failed so badly (to me).

But I'm glad I watched it again. I caught a lot more of the musical references/in-jokes for one. And I think the first time I saw it I *really* wasn't in the right frame of mind and judged it quite harshly. Are the cast super-talented singing-wise? For the most part, no. Except Lassiter. Oh my, his deep voice actually did give me chills a little. The rest were all passable (except...sorry, Maggie, but...Juliet, not so much. But that's okay! Loved her anyway. Perhaps more because she was giving it her all despite not having a great singing voice.)

I actually watched it last night, a third time after having not watched it for a few weeks, and found that I was really enjoying it more with the subsequent watchings. My only complaints were that Bostwick didn't sing :(  and that I would've liked Rapp to sing a bit more. But overall it's a fun episode, and despite my first impression, believe it will be one of my favorite eps of the series.",1391990400,2,1477,4.422794117647059

6015147,2,B00FMR66J0,"When I saw that they had made this kind of show with the Psych cast, I looked forward to seeing it.  Not only is it one of the best comedy shows on TV right now, they have often shown clips of the Psych cast messing around on the set and singing, and the show is often full of references to music and musicians.  We decided to watch this on a night of someone's birthday as part of the celebration.  What a disappointment!  Not only were the songs not very good nor the singing (which I hadn't imagined would be top rate anyway) but it was just the most boring, unfunny episode of Psych I have ever seen.  I like Psych.  I like musicals.  But I think, this was a big mistake.  Dule Hill's performance, however, was once again the best part of the show.  Psych is in the progress of airing its last episodes.  I hope the end of this last season proves to be a lot better than this particular episode!",1391472000,,899,4.174418604651163

Your mileage might vary, but for me the music was marginal, the dancing was close to spastic, and the lyrics ""sucked it."" Add to that and the mystery wasn't even up to the series average.

Tons of cameos and references and blink-and-you'll-miss-its demand repeated viewings.  Not all of the songs are amazing but they generally make up for it with whimsically ridiculous lyrics.

From Shawn & Gus's mood setting ""Under Santa Barbra Skies"" to Woody's ""It's the Opposite of That"", the music and lyrics are catchy and whimsical. It is the comedy writing and execution I have loved for seven years combined with fun choreography and memorable songs. The only thing missing was another appearance by Curt Smith.

I loved the songs the story was not that great but when tv shows do these special episodes I don't care about the story line. Really it just shows what kind of TV show psych is where they made this musical just for its fans.

Now for the actually DVD. It comes with four musical episodes and the soundtrack. I think it would have been cool if it had other special features like the making of or why they decided to do a musical episode or even the digital copy to the episodes.

6015209,3,B00FMR66J0,"So many shows try a musical episode at least once in their run.  I must say this is the first one I can remember that actually had all singing characters able to carry a tune, most with fairly good voices.  That alone made this a cut above other attempts at musicals.  I did find it a little hard to follow at times and the music a little distracting (besides the fact that I fell asleep while watching).  After two viewings, I actually had to back it up to find out who did it and why but it was good enough to sit through the two views and I will probably watch again.  I think it may be one of those that grows on you as you quit being distracted by the singing and dancing and simply embrace it as part of the story.

The only problem?  Psych's brand of humor is an awesome one, but one that best fits within the hour.  The resolution?  A good cast willing to do the work with lots of energy and good will kept me entertained.

The musical numbers aren't Broadway, but a lot better than I expected them to be and it seems our crazy cast has some hidden singing talent in its midst, some being better than others but no one truly terrible. The songs are funny, often based on running and inside jokes from the series, and everyone jumps on board with hamming up every section of the musical.

The plot is one of solid Psych respectability, just stretched out longer with extra detail and twists.

I don't know if it's the most memorable Psych moment, but it was a lot of fun to watch and rewatch and fans will be pleased.",1388448000,,1030,4.412698412698413
6015220,3,B00FMR66J0,"The witty and comical tv show returns in this musical version.  Audiences who are loyal may be confused as this special does not occur chronologically after the previous seasons ending.  The saving grace of this episode is Sean, who turns out to be a dynamic actor/dancer and a generic singer (works in his favor though!).  Most other main characters other than Lassie and Chief Vick have sub-par voices, and most have poor dancing ability (excpet for Guster and Lassie).  Juliet is a weak link IMO as her acting is significantly better than her singing.

As for the guest star, (an original cast member of RENT, I forget his name) has great moments but he seems to be under utilized for as good of a actor/singer he is.

This is a funny episode of Psych and a so-so TV musical.",1388361600,3,778,4.561151079136691

6015240,3,B00FMR66J0,"My wife and I are avid fans of the show, having watched all seasons through at least a couple of times. Needless to say, we're always eager to see the newest episode when it's released.

From the very beginning we came to the agreement that it's just not the same show. After sitting through the first half hour contemplating whether or not we'd just switch it off, the show does actually pick up and the plot starts to develop. But it's not the greatest plot in the history of the show, and I think they intentionally made it convoluted and weak in some places for the mere sake of making a 2 hour ""musical"" special (making it drag on for perhaps an extra thirty minutes).

And the story isn't the only thing they sacrificed to make this special. The quick wit and charm of the characters is lost among the singing. There are some exceptions (of course, Woody the Coroner's solo stands out as hilarious), but the majority of the songs are just too forced, too extravagant for what they're trying to do (and I can't count the number of times you can hear ""I've heard it both ways"", in several songs throughout the episode). The cast dances around but it doesn't look natural, it doesn't look like they're enjoying it.

I was surprised by the re-introduction of one of the show's long-time characters (I won't ruin it), and they did a good job of writing that character into the story. And there were some moments where the cast's jovial nature burst out and you could see the chemistry again, but they were few and far between.

Overall, I'm reluctantly forced to rate this as three stars. Length does not equal quality, and I think in this case unfortunately the writers didn't understand that. The music was more miss than hit, and the classic Psych charm must have gone South for the winter, because it wasn't here for this special. I'd still recommend it if you're a true fan of the show (though be prepared for a little disappointment), but if you're just getting into the show, save it for later... a lot later.",1387843200,2,2017,4.532967032967033

Fun  & Funny jokes as always with this show...LOVED LOVED IT! ..Its fun ""spur of the moment"" like everything Shawn does..the eternal Peter Pan..Whether you like musicals or not- RENT OR BUY THIS episode..THE OPENING SEQUENCE is worth the price of admission, "" Under Santa Barbara Skies"" is just fun, & James Roday sings very well and will make you laugh along with Shawn..And Gus keeps trying to remake Sherlock Holmes, as a Jamaican investigator..YOU JUST HAVE TO SEE IT!!",1387756800,10,2035,4.924198250728863

The music did help lighten the mood, but the plot was closer to one of the more dark episodes they have.

This is a musical that doesn't take itself too seriously. Which for ""Psych"" works. If you're looking for broadway greatness, don't bother. ( However I will say for what it was it was great)  Also Anthony Rapp was fantastic in this. It was a real treat to see him.  Also I was surprised by the vocal ability of the actors in the Psych cast. Plain and simple if you love Psych, you will love this.

6015255,2,B00FMR66J0,"My wife and I were both disappointed in this musical. I was amazed to see all the five star ratings, so I felt I needed to post something to at least provide a different perspective and why we didn't like the show.

First, a musical only needs a minimum of a plot to work, but this plot seemed awkward and contrived. A serial killer has information the group wants but refuses to cooperate unless they sing to her.  Lassie refuses, but then later sings when Mr. Yang isn't even present. If a show is going to have a plot, it should follow it. The whole musical within a musical didn't work for us. There are lots of ways to put on a musical... a dream sequence (Dallas), a concussion (Wizard of Oz), a fever causing delirium... any of those would have been better way.  As a viewer, I'm not watching to see some creative, original reason for the cast to sing and dance. Just give us a standard plot and get on with the entertainment.

In a musical, I want to hear the characters who can really sing get to showcase their talent. For example, the Captain was excellent in her very short number with Jules and Lassie, but that was her only solo lines. Gus really didn't get to showcase his singing until the ending credits. Ally Sheedy can really sing, but she only got one good vocal at the very end.  A couple more guest stars have great voices. You could tell from the few lines they got, but they never really got a big number. On the other hand, we got to hear Sean sing... a lot... okay, he can sing. We get it. Let someone else have a few lines.

The numbers themselves were very forgettable. The captain, Jules, and Lassie was the best number, but it was very short.

And Barry Bostwick never sang a single line that I can remember!!! Bostwick appeared in one of the greatest cult musicals of all time The Rocky Horror Picture Show and he has a great voice. Or I should say, he used to. You can't tell from this musical because he never even talked a verse.  I felt very short-changed that such an icon of cult musicals shouldn't get the opportunity to sing. At least give him a line, like Henry who when asked to sing said, ""not gonna happen.""

Gus did a few tap dance routines, but it was mostly slapstick or a three second camo in the middle of a bigger number. The guy can dance. Let him show his stuff. Loyal fans wanted to see it.

Finally, a musical should end with a big all-cast number. This show didn't even end with a number. It just sort of ended with the guys talking. What a let down!

If you want to watch a great musical, watch ""Once More With Feeling"" from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Every member of the cast who could sing got their own number and major parts in the big numbers.  Everything advanced the plot and it even had several sub-plots that stayed true to the ongoing lines in each case.  The guest star could sing and dance and, unlike Psych, the Buffy musical really showcased the guest star's talent.

My major disappointment was this this show has so much talent and so many guest stars with great talent that it failed to rise to the occasion.",1387324800,10,3079,4.322916666666667

Psych is the best show ever, and I couldn't imagine it getting better...until they added singing and dancing. Dule's talent has peeped out from time to time, but wow...the whole cast has talent! There is something so human and inspiring about song. Thank you, Mr. Franks! An especial thank you to the wonderfully touching scene with Mary and Yang...loved it. And also thank you because ""Jamaican Inspector Man"" is stuck in my head!",1387238400,2,509,4.930232558139535
6015257,4,B00FMR66J0,"I thought that the musical was good, but not up to Psych standards as far as I'm concerned. I don't think that I will be buying the episode any time soon, but I will take a look when it becomes available online.",1387238400,3,211,4.0476190476190474
6015258,3,B00FMR66J0,"I can't believe it, especially considering how big of a Psych fan I have been over the years, but this musical was just...meh. It's not that the plot, the acting, or the music weren't great, I just think that this continues the theme of what Psych has become in the last few years: everyone is trying waaaayyy too hard. I wish there was a way for Psych to get back to its roots - the earlier seasons and later ones are barely recognizable in terms of energy, character dynamic, etc., but perhaps the evolutionary nature of human relationships, even on-camera ones, means that this is going to be the best we have going forward. I think this was a good thing for Psych to do, but it definitely needs to be the penultimate season finale.",1387238400,2,735,4.451851851851852
6015259,5,B00FMR66J0,"Ridiculously funny and entertaining!!~ Especially Lassie's part.
I love how they decided to do a musical spin on this, really just amazing!",1387152000,2,139,5.363636363636363
6015260,4,B00FMR66J0,"I rarely like musicals but they used the format well and didn't try to be something other than Psych so it worked. It worked pretty good actually. It wasn't awkward at all, which I kind of thought it might be, and I really enjoyed it.

The musical aspect of the show definitely dies down after the longer opening numbers are through and then it's for the most part just a normal Psych episode with occasional shorter numbers that blend well with the scene.

I do hope this season they remembered that the charm of the show was based on Shawn and Gus and NOT Shawn and Juliette, or Gus and his girl, or Lassiter and his. The other characters are meaningless to me except for something for Shawn and Gus to work off of. The character of Henry is the only one that is more than a mere compliment to the pair and he could even successfully make it a trio but not any of the others. They could be replaced and the character of the show still remain so attempting not only some ensemble cast, but even worse a cast of a bunch of boyfriends and girlfriends, weakened the show. I hope for this last season they go back to what worked so well.",1387152000,8,1134,4.269767441860465

6015266,5,B00FMR66J0,I've been a big Psych fan for a while and this musical continues the show's tradition of zany antics and crazy characters. I won't ruin anything for anyone but the song with Dule (Gus) at the end had me in stitches.,1387152000,2,215,4.2682926829268295

Psych is a great show and the fact that they took their talents and expanded it into a longer show with all sorts of crazy dancing and singing just makes it more fun.

I think you must have to be a great Psych fan to love this show. If you just feel Psych is ok or not your kind of show you might feel as if this is over the top or too crazy.",1530921600,,491,3.6320754716981134
