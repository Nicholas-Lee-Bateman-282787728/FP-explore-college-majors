8057759,4,B00097DQE6,"The schooner Tiki sailed into our Texas ranch livingroom in glorious B&W in 1959, appearing on our first TV set with an engaging blend of romance and realism in the South Seas.  Little did I know that McKay's adventures would lure me off the range and onto the sea myself about a decade later.  Today, a lifetime later, watching these episodes, even though the quality of some of the scene-splicing recovered parts of the second episode on Vol1 was not good at all (I respliced it using video-editing freeware), the enjoyment of both the stories and the memories has driven me back looking for all of the rest of the show.  Finding this on Amazon also sent me hunting for McKay's whereabouts, because I'd always liked him as an actor.  Where was he?  It turned out Gardner had become a teacher of drama and a playwrite himself, living in Hawaii for all these years, but sadly he had just passed away in 2002.  I would like to have thanked him for his work.  Take a look at these stories and you'll see why.",1169078400,14,1006,4.46448087431694
