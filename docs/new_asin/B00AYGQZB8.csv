8559203,1,B00AYGQZB8,This BD is for PAL system. Can't be played in US.,1517961600,,49,3.5454545454545454
8559204,5,B00AYGQZB8,Not as good as March of the Penguins in my opinion but still very good. The quality of the filming though is better due to the hidden cameras and the new types of views that they offer. Well worth getting in my opinion. If you love Penguins you won't be disappointed. A word of warning though I think the blue ray version at least the one I got won't work on a normal US blue ray player. It worked on mine but I have a region free one. I have seen this documentary for sale though in the US on DVD. I wouldn't be surprised if I came across it here on Blue Ray now.,1442707200,,564,3.9130434782608696
8559205,5,B00AYGQZB8,"This is only one segment from the 2013 BBC Spy series shown in UK from tigers to elephants to dolphins. Penguin segment is two and half hour long, beautifully shot documentary about penguins that will be as entertaining as any Disney documentary for the kids in the family.

Jon Downer is a genius film maker who captures the animal kingdom by placing cameras in protective shells in a revolutionary tactics, matching the environment without causing any commotion or discomfort to animals that he is trying to capture which allows the viewer to experience the animals in their natural states without any harm to the camera man. For DVD players in US check the Product Detail section of the item to insure a region 1/NTSC format. To enjoy John's other masterpieces about lions, elephants, bears and dolphins check out the comment section of this review. There is truly something captivating about getting so close to this wild animals in their own environment which is not the same as witnessing it from a distance even with the best HD cameras, absolutely real and live. Anticipate the best of dolphins documentary with spycam to be released in late 2014 unless you have BBC UK reception at present time. Bravo.",1411603200,3,1211,4.878640776699029
