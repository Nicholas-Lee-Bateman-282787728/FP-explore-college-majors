1899802,5,B00009ZY9E,"If you work in an office anywhere you'll relate well to this BBC series.  I thought the movie ""Office Space"" was amusing, but this tv series really nails it - and since the BBC has fewer restrictions than US broadcasters, all the foul language and humour found in most offices remain intact.
Each episode will leave you laughing and talking about it later...",1055635200,3,358,4.682539682539683

I personally felt it was boring and just did not get into it. I have watched the American version of ""The Office"" first and it was significantly better and maybe that's what killed this version for me. I got about half way through before I just had to stop it. I just couldn't do it.",1414972800,,472,4.0212765957446805

It's filmed as though someone is silently making a documentary about a charming paper company, and the eccentric but lovable boss ""David Brent,"" who is played by Gervais. His employees are also running the gamut from totally odd to fairly normal.  Makes for great chemistry.

1899842,3,B00009ZY9E,"In the semi-rare instance where the remake is better than the original, the UK version shows us instances of rapier wit -- albeit dulled by an understated monotony of UK personality. I'm sure there's a contingent of ""You just don't UNDERSTAND British humor!"" backlash to condemn this review, but let me assure you: I *get it* enough to know when to laugh and when to split my attention between the humdrum of this show and whatever game I've got going on my Kindle at the moment.

Concurrent television and tablet entertainment; how is THAT for a heavy dose of 'Merica?

Fans of the American version will want to tune into this series just to see the roots of Jim and Pam, but don't expect much in the way of charm or depth. Without the over-the-top inanity of Michael Scott, or the creepily-laughable derangement of Dwight, the deadpan duldrums become the norm, which deadens a majority of the hijinky fun.

There aren't many episodes, so it's not like you're investing a TON of time into it... which is good, because what you're going to find are some of the exact same jokes performed much more poorly, and a debilitating ""meh"" tone to kill your attention. Odds are, you won't get drawn into any of the characters or storylines, but it's has a certain quaintness to at least provide background noise.",1396396800,,1303,4.681222707423581
1899843,5,B00009ZY9E,I can't ever imagine not laughing at least 4 times an episode. It will always be funny timeless. Thanks Ricky,1395878400,,109,4.5
1899844,5,B00009ZY9E,"I'm still partial to the US version, because that is the one that I fell in love with. However, I love watching the original UK version. It's fantastic on its own and I love the segments that the US version either copied or adapted, like putting the stapler in Jell-O!",1392940800,,268,4.38
1899845,5,B00009ZY9E,"I had never seen the British version before watching the entire run of the American television version of THE OFFICE. I am a huge fan of the American version and was interested in seeing the original British version. Season one was very funny and interesting to see how it created the inspiration for the American version's characters. Ricky Gervais is a complete riot as David Brent, the manager of the paper company. You just can't help but love the guy. I was really surprised to see the great Martin Freeman playing Tim Canterbury (the Jim Halpern role in America) who has gone on to even greater roles in THE HOBBIT trilogy and the equally great BBC series  ""SHERLOCK"" with Benedict Cumberbatch. One of my absolute favorites from the British version of THE OFFICE is MacKenzie Crook who plays Gareth Keenan, (the Dwight character in the American version) Mr. Cooke is an absolute gem and made this character his own. He has also gone on to a very distinguished career in the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN films and the new FOX television show here in the states called ALMOST HUMAN. Like in the other roles he has done he really shines as Rudy Lom in that show as well. I highly recommend that everyone, especially fans of all things British watch the British verison of THE OFFICE. I have started on the second season and have not been disappointed.",1392681600,3,1350,4.6722689075630255
1899846,5,B00009ZY9E,Ricky Gervais is a comic genius! Martin Freeman is hilarious! So happy to have seen the original series that was the inspiration for the American version of The Office.,1392249600,,168,4.827586206896552
1899848,2,B00009ZY9E,"My first exposure to The Office was the US version, which I found to be quite entertaining and enjoyable. It seemed worth checking out the source material. But the British version of the show was miserable compared to the American version. And this is coming from someone who watches more BBC than any other stations combined! Okay, that's an exaggeration, but I do love me some Brits. Just not these Brits. This version of the show is misanthropic to a degree that is not just uncomfortable, but also unfunny. It truly feels like a dark parody of the US version, even though it came first. If that's your thing, you will enjoy this show. But it did nothing for me.",1391731200,,665,4.55
1899849,2,B00009ZY9E,"All I can say it, thank God for the American version! Thank you, UK, for the inspiration though. Part of the reason I didn't enjoy this show is that I have a hard time following their British vernacular...and the boss' mannerisms are just unbearable. Michael Scott is deliciously self-deluded, but he's smoother than the boss played by Ricky Gervais. However, all in all, its fun to see how the characters compare from one country to the other. :)",1391558400,,447,4.743589743589744

1899851,5,B00009ZY9E,I had seen the American version and just decided to check out the original BBC series for fun. Glad I did. Amazing cast and storyline.,1390953600,,134,4.4
1899852,5,B00009ZY9E,I can now see where the American version of the Office got its inspiration!  This original version was 100% hilarious!,1390521600,,118,4.9
1899853,4,B00009ZY9E,"Very dry humor (British).  Rick Gervais is tremendous.  Different to the American version but has many character similarities and still have the same ""oh, I can not believe he said that"" feel.",1389657600,,192,4.96875
1899854,4,B00009ZY9E,"I really love British comedy--but I watched this after seeing the American version.  The American version pretty much copied the script of the British version line by line.  Plots were the same too.  The only thing the American version did better was the Dwight Shrute character--the American one is a lot more interesting than the British one.  Other than that, Ricky Gervais owns this show--he is awesome as the boss--I would definitely give this a try if you like the American version.  This version is a lot less polished but still very funny!  If you have ideas of the American version of each character in your head it's interesting to compare them.",1389398400,3,655,4.803571428571429
1899855,5,B00009ZY9E,Hilarious. And I love it since it is instant watch on amazon prime. Ricky gervais is pretty funny. Would recommend,1389225600,,114,4.75
1899856,3,B00009ZY9E,"I normally enjoy British sitcoms, but this entry is entirely too preoccupied with overt juvenile sexual innuendo, while the U.S. version is more subtle in its presentation. I also prefer Steve Carrell to Ricky Gervais, and THAT even surprised me!",1389139200,,246,5.175
1899857,4,B00009ZY9E,I like this British version much better. Really great acting and very funny show. have become a Ricky Gervais fan.,1387843200,,114,4.75

1899861,1,B00009ZY9E,I normally love British humor. I just don't get The Office. This is perhaps the only series where I have felt that the US version was better than the UK version. DISCLOSURE: I only watched half of the first episode; it might get much better afterwards.,1381622400,,252,4.5
1899862,2,B00009ZY9E,"I have never watched either version of this show.  I have always heard that they are both good.  I admit I only

1899865,5,B00009ZY9E,"If you are a big fan of the US version of The Office, then I urge you to watch just a few episodes of the UK version.

1899866,5,B00009ZY9E,Dry and hilarious. The only criticism I have is how few episodes there are.  If you like this I also recommend Extras.,1377734400,2,118,4.363636363636363

1899883,5,B00009ZY9E,"The UK version is the one to watch. I cod never get into the US version, but that should not be a surprise.

I never could get into the US version, YMMV.",1371686400,2,299,3.761904761904762

1899885,3,B00009ZY9E,I like the American version better. Maybe if I watched a few more episodes I'd like it however I didn't have time to watch more.,1370563200,,128,4.16
1899886,5,B00009ZY9E,"The original version of The Office is cringe-inducing, mean, and hilarious.

US boss Michael Scott is goofy, warm-hearted, and says silly things that aren't always politically correct. Many of his employees are incredibly weird, so their interactions are funny without anybody ever getting hurt.

UK boss David Brent is cutting, back-stabbing, vindictive, jealous, dishonest, obnoxious, and most definitely not politically correct, and he knows very well what he's doing the whole time. His employees, on the other hand, are for the most part normal people with normal emotional responses. (The UK version of Dwight is still weird.) You see them feel sad, angry, annoyed, unsure of how to respond, etc. When David is mean to them, they are hurt.

If you stuck with the US version past season 3 or 4 and you enjoyed the innocent pranks and seeing everybody get happy endings, I have to say there's a good chance you won't like this show. If you want to give it a chance, you should commit to watching more than just the first episode or two. Like many new things, it might take a while for you to acquire a taste for it.

If you watch the entire thing, you'll see some great stuff that in my opinion didn't happen on the US version, such as meaningful character development in the boss. You'll see him in some human moments where the mask is off so to speak.",1368403200,3,1357,4.689075630252101
1899887,4,B00009ZY9E,"The first season of The Office isn't as dark as it would later become (and whether you prefer that darkness is entirely up to you; personally I loved it) but it's still fantastically uncomfortable and a great start to a phenomenal - if, as ever with BBC productions, short - series.  'Training' is probably the best episode of the bunch here, and although it's a little more silly and outlandish in regards to Brent's tunes it's a hoot from start to finish.  Hey, I'd buy one of his albums.

Definitely not for everybody.  I'd recommend at least two episodes to see if it's your 'thing', as the first episode is probably the weakest out of the whole shebang.",1366761600,2,658,4.5508474576271185

1899889,5,B00009ZY9E,"The show is hilarious and filled with awkward moments.  It is not as sweet as the US version.  My only complaint (not sure if this should be in the ""feedback"" review option for vendors and shipping and such) involves the streaming of two episodes, after watching a few minutes, the content would pause and would not continue.  After multiple attempts to watch the episodes, we had to give up and stream another show and go back to The Office at a later date to watch them.",1362787200,,472,4.465116279069767
1899890,4,B00009ZY9E,"I've seen many people on here comparing this version of 'The Office' to the American version, saying things like, it tried too hard to be like the American Version' or 'Not as good as the original'...
THIS IS the original Office!
The format has been so copied and many of the jokes have been lifted, but This is the ORIGINAL version - never before tried.
After a while, the writers and production moved to America, and Most of the show was made by the Same people, but in America you got all new characters, and the American style of jokes and references.  Cleverly, the makers of the American KNOCK OFF used the same clever people behind This Original Version, but I cannot help but miss the genuinely unique version, as presented here.

I have heard that there are versions of this show in many many more countries now, and that, like sesame street, they each have different versions of each of the characters...  but for a look at the First Show in the First Itteration, Only THIS ORIGINAL OFFICE can provide that kind of insight.

I am very much more of a fan of the British Versions, and the Originals that the BBC makes, in general, so it's not surprising that this one's my favorite...
If you ever watch the First season of the American COPY of this show, you often discouragingly recognise jokes taken Directly From THIS version...
In the end, it has gone on for far longer, and proven to be a powerhouse in its own right, but I generally prefer the 'originals' to a rebranded copy...

Most of you watching the US version of The Office don't realize that the original version appeared on BBC in the UK.  The ""Michael Scott"" of the UK is played by Ricky Gervais and if you thought Michael Scott was awkward, Gervais' character is doubly awkward, but that's why The Office UK is a must watch.  Dwight Shrute's character in the UK version is hilariously ""bullied"", but the jokes that Jim (US) plays on Dwight in the US version are much funnier.  Still hilarious so don't let that deter you from watching it.  Oh and for those who look forward to Jim's (US) priceless expressions, they are not quite as priceless as the version in the UK.

It's a well known fact that Gervais ends his shows during the height of a show's success so many of the storylines you're used to watching in the US version is not nearly as expanded as in the UK version.  I mean The Office US is now going into its 8th season while the UK version only has 2 full season and a 3rd special episode.

All that being said, I highly recommend you watch this.  You will want to rewind some parts over and over again because they're so hilarious.",1309305600,5,1222,4.3201754385964914

Pokes fun at a rather typical, middle aged, undereducated, white male ekeing it out in an obscure middleman business in a former superpower nation.

He is aggressive, overselling, sales-oriented, puffery-prone, necessarily blind to his faults, lonely, desperate, not searching for meaning, and vain.

I was just laughing and laughing.  Weeks later, I catch myself thinking about the four main characters and where they are now, that's how thoroughly and richly characterized they are.  Just felt they were real people at a very real boring office job in a most unglamorous smallish town.  Shocked to find that they are real actors who have had other acting gigs in other movies and the theater.

These British actors did not undergo plastic surgery or expensive hair and teeth jobs, and that adds to their believability as office workers.  Also adds to their charm - they love themselves and their culture.  They don't need enhancements.  They have real dialogue instead.

I will not watch another American tv series again, not with its obvious humor and its tabloid-obsessed, steroid enhanced, plastic boobed stars.  I would rather exhaust the entire BBC comedy library first.",1290816000,2,1342,5.186046511627907

This version holds the awkward pauses longer, and has many moments where I truly wanted to pause just for relief from the discomfort it's realism brings forth; and yet, I laughed. Episode Four is probably the best in this series (season). The main characters are given much more attention and the secondary characters much less than in the American version, but the actors make you realize why--they are incredibly brillant.  A reviewer commented that this is very raunchy; it definitely has its moments. Scenes that would never have flown in the American version stand proudly in the original, scenes that no one would have believed in America because of our more stringent sexual harassment clauses. But, then, it's British humor, and I get and can appreciate it. Anyway, give it a shot, whether you like the American version (which I do) or not.

There are no traditional punchlines, catch phrases, ""wacky"" situations or unrealistically outrageous characters and, if the viewer would willingly suspend his disbelief, it could very well be the thing it purports to be: a documentary of an actual, ordinary office environment, with all its ugly-to-mediocre looking people and their ludicrous banalities, foibles and petty dramas. Any person who has ever worked in an office, or has been in any human grouping for that matter, will recognize the characters and situations of ""The Office"" as entirely true to life and not comedic exaggerations, and I guess that's what makes this show so funny: real life can be pretty bloody hilarious. Ordinary people saying and doing stupid and awkward things...you can't beat it.

1899917,4,B00009ZY9E,"When an American version of the Office was announced, there was a feeling of ""ugh, another show getting ruined"". Everyone kept saying the British one was better even though they liked the American one too so I checked out that one and found it insanely funny and even touching. Well naturally, the British version has to be just as good right? While I did find it enjoyable to a degree, there's a certain aspect to the humor that feels lost on me; whether it's British humor, underdeveloped secondary charracters or certain aspects that didn't get enough time, the British version of the Office is enjoyable in its own right but I tend to prefer the American one.

The show centers on the paper company Wernham-Hogg in the town of Slough. The place is run by David Brent, a self-proclaimed hilarious man who truly believes everyone thinks he's a great boss and a funny one to boot. His right-hand man (he thinks he's Assistant Manager but he's really Assistant TO the Regional Manager) is Gareth Keenan, an incredibly odd man who has a tendency to show strange behaviour and see David as a kind of mentor. Also in the office is Tim, a 30 year-old who feels his life is being wasted selling paper. He has a secret crush on Dawn, the office receptionist, who is engaged to an inconsiderate oaf of a man named Lee. Shot documentary style, we see the ins and outs of the day-to-day life of the people in the office.

The show as a whole is kind of like a comedy show but without wisecracking humor in the vein of Friends or Everybody Loves Raymond. The humor is rather centered on the knowing parts of life where you can think ""I know someone exactly like that"". Much of the show's humor comes from Brent himself, since he just seems unaware that he's not funny at all but wholeheartedly believes that people just love the guy. That leads into embarassing situations where he'll make a fool of himself in front of people. In one scene, he pretends to fire Dawn for stealing but he intended it as a joke where everyone can have a laugh. When she renounces him and calls him a sad man, he's completely ignorant to what he's done.

Well, how is this version different compared to the American one? Well the Michael Scott role (the David Brent counterpart) is more of a well-intentioned but incompetent boss; someone who knows people don't laugh at him but he shrugs it off and shoulders on anyway. You can see Michael sometimes take it hard when a joke goes awry but then he'll get right back at it and try again whereas David almost has a egoist grin and a completely misguided view of himself, like too much pride. A joke doesn't work? Just keep plugging away until he decides to leave. Meanwhile the Tim/Dawn romance is well-developed but not enough since it almost comes across initially as one-sided with Tim loving Dawn but she's not quite at the level he is. Pam on the other hand loves Roy but you got the feeling she'd much rather be with Jim if she could escape Roy's clutches. Jim is way more mischievious and full of pranks with Pam even in on a bulk of them while Dawn is almost amused by them.

Not only does the events surrounding the characters change but sometimes the character itself. Tim uses humor because what else does he have? Jim is quite popular with the ladies so he uses humor because it's fun for him. The other change is the character of Gareth, his American counterpart being Dwight Schrute. Quite frankly, Gareth is too gangly and just plain creepy that you wonder why someone didn't pop him one. He gives off an uncomfortable vibe whenever he's around. Dwight on the other hand is an oddball but a lovable one; one whose quirks amuse even if it's for the wrong reasons. Not to mention the secondary characters in the British one are kind of forgettable. In fact, the focus on David, Gareth, Tim and Dawn is so extensive that I literally forgot at one point everyone else's names.

I'm not disappointed at all with this version, really. It's more a case of the kind of humor you tend to prefer so while I did laugh at times on this one, the American one will routinely make me laugh quite hard. But try this one out anyway.",1175731200,2,4148,4.50332005312085

1899919,5,B00009ZY9E,"This is the original and the far superior version.  The American version of the show has some funny moments, but is nowhere even close to equalling the sheer greatness of this series.  Taken as a whole (first and second series and the Christmas special), the British (original) verison is funnier on every level and has one of the best romances I've ever seen in any medium.  It's subtle where it needs to be and over the top at just the right moment.

Fans of the US show who haven't seen the original owe it to themselves to at least give it a shot.  If your entertainment diet, however, has been strictly American, you may have a hard time with this series.  BBC doesn't usually treat its audience like children or developmentally disabled adults like American television does.  Yes, the jokes can be dirtier at times (and don't think the writers of the American version wouldn't love to be able to go as far as the British creators did), but the humor is also more mature on levels that aren't explicit.

The show is genius. From the opening downbeat music (check out the lyrics to the song, which are included with the DVD) to the facial expressions of the characters.  Every note is spot-on and it seriously puts the US version to shame.",1171065600,7,1243,4.563063063063063
1899920,5,B00009ZY9E,"aaahhh, our foolish American Cousins... Felt I simply had to comment on the negative reviews from this page particularly Utah.  Utah mook talks of every joke being smutty and body-function based - Are you watching the correct DVD.  There are more references to sex and toilet humor than the US version, and thats mainly because your television companies treat you like children, who can't possible hear anything risque on Prime time basic cable.  The BBC in England are a little more respectful to their audience.  And as for having to turn the sub-titles on, it never ceases to amaze me how Americans can't understand their own language when spoken in a slightly different accent (funny how you can probably understand cousin Cletus from THE SIMPSONS - what does that tell you)

The office is PERFECT - casting, writing, the slow burn of story arcs, and most importantly comic timing.  In the US OFFICE, timing is equated with long pauses.  Gareth in the UK series has probably the best comic timing in the show, and its these nuances that lift it to near divine comedy, and above the heads of the US nay-sayers.

Absolutely, if you need a bit of an edgy comedy like the UK Office but can't quite manage to get your head around the subtly and sublime darkness of Ricky Gervais et al, then go for the easier, more pedestrian version that is the US version.  The US version is the OFFICE Lite or the Office for Dummies....or Utah mooks.  Its for people who think Will Farrell is funny.

The tragedy of David Brent really is just that, painful, funny, heart wrenchingly sad, and ball bouncingly pathetic.  Its harsh and caustic and brutal and maybe not for US palettes, who seem to be much more content for easy laughs and a happy ending. Steve Carrell plays a slightly more awkward Steve Carrell.  You are always aware that you are watching Steve Carrell.  The American version, not without laughs I grant you, has the actors playing caricatures instead of characters, especially Dwight.  He is not in the same universe as his UK counterpart.",1169337600,6,2041,4.7259887005649714

If you have any standards at all, leave this one alone and try the american version, much cleaner and much funnier.

Why four stars from me?  The inclusion of some pretty raunchy dialog which some may enjoy while others need to know about so they can be careful watching around the kiddies.

This show, more than any other show that I've found (Seinfeld included) makes me want to watch its episodes over and over again - and never tire of them.

1899925,5,B00009ZY9E,"The BBC have out-done themselves this time with The office. When I first watched it I thought it was so different. It is completely unlike the average sitcom.

As one reviewer pointed out it only has 6 episodes, most BBC sitcoms only come in six, because usally they only have one or two writers, French & saunders or performers and writers. Absolutely Fabulous writer jennifer saunders, rowan atkinson blackadder and so on. This is probably to do with costs.

And as for it going on a full 30 minutes, the BBC at least in Britain has no adverts, everyone in Britain must pay to have a tv licence (by law) If you own a tv. It cost between ?100 and ?200 ($200 and $400 I think)

I find US sitcoms very funny but when the BBC buys them to show. I can't believe how many adverts you guys are willing to watch- but it is worth it in the end because you Americans have some of the best TV in the world.

I havn't watched the American version yet, its been on BBC 3 but I havn't had the time, I hope to watch it soon though. I didn't like the The 40 Year Old Virgin (2005)film so I'm not so sure about Steve Carell.

1899927,4,B00009ZY9E,"Like a lot of newer fans to the British ""Office"", I came to the show via the American version which began airing this year. It would be fair to say that I prefer the American version, simply because it's the best thing currently on the air (now that ""Arrested Development"" has died a cruelly young death). But I'm man enough to admit that the original isn't too shabby either. I'm a grown-up, unlike most of the Brit original fans who rag on the American one.

The set-up is thus: David Brent is the manager of a paper company in a London suburb with the attractive name of ""Slough"". His underling, Gareth Keenan, is a weasly little kiss-butt. Tim and Dawn, the star-crossed couple of the office, have to deal with the immovable object known as Dawn's fiancee Lee. And around them, all sorts of characters both unique and easily recognizable hover throughout the day, bored to tears but still in fear of losing their jobs due to rumored ""downsizing"".

The show is built on the notion that Brent hogs the camera and makes the show his personal enterprise, spouting out all sorts of praise on himself. The fact that he emerges not as the genius and lovable manager that he thinks he is makes the show tick. It's his buffoonery that the show relies on.

Maybe it's just because I watched the American version first, but I found that the focus on Brent took away from a lot of the secondary-character development that the NBC show nailed. You get a feel for David, Gareth, Tim, and Dawn, but the others seem on the periphery of the action. The NBC version has managed to make the characters other than the main quartet accessible and human. Here, they are but faces in the crowd, blocked out by David's antics. Quite a few moments occur when some of the characters do emerge as human beings with their own stories, but the focus on all things Brent doesn't allow for much more than a few choice lines and awkward moments.

That being said, the show works for what it is, a satire of the workplace enviroment. In a company that essentially pushes paper, there's little else to feel secure about. It's not as if these people can measure how productive their days are by looking at their output. So they are bored, and looking for things to do to alleviate that. The workplace is a showcase for their antics.

This, the first season of the British original, is chock-full of hilarious moments that will make you laugh out loud or cringe in horror. Is it better than the American version? I'll just say that the shows work on their own levels, and the Brit version is truly an original worth catching.",1132099200,3,2593,4.54389721627409
1899928,5,B00009ZY9E,"This truly is a one-of-a-kind series. I don't think I'll give much away by saying that this is a tragedy (that stretches all the way through the series), but a hilarious one at that. The humor is often somewhat subtle, but there is a nice balance of tasteful, obvious jokes, awkward situations (once again, though - tasteful - it's not as extreme as, say, Mr. Bean), and subtle, almost subliminal, humor.

1899931,5,B00009ZY9E,"This is quite simply the funniest show I have ever seen in my life, and I doubt (sadly) that I ever again will see another comedy of this calibre. There were times throughout watching this series I had to pause my DVD because the laughter was getting on top of me and I needed a short break to pull myself together. It really is that good.

Without going too deep into describing this piece (as it can only really be understood in the watching), The Office is as a general idea quite simplistic.

A small paper merchant on the outskirts of London being filmed in a mockumentary style, with boss David Brent (Ricky Gervais) trying so hard to make himself look good in front of the cameras that he inevitably makes himself look like a t**t. The subtelty of the writing and acting involved in this however, is what makes it so special.

For those who don't get the humour involved in this series I really do despair because you have been deprived from the best TV has to offer. However, if you watch The Office and enjoy it, I would highly recommend one of the best kept secrets of British comedy - 'The Royle Family'. It is the only thing that comes close.",1120521600,,1154,4.383177570093458

This British mock documentary series takes viewers through days in the office of a paper company.  The workers and characters are largely unsympathetic, yet somehow draw viewers to them.

The main character, the boss, wants so desperately to be liked and admired by his staff (his family, as he calls them) that he drives everyone crazy with his over-the-top jokes and expanded ego.  Gareth, Assistant Regional Manager (or Assistant to the Regional Manager) provides constant comic humour through his fragile appearance but tough talk coming from his experience in the Territorial Army.  When Tim isn't fighting with anal Gareth or planning how to leave his boring job, he's flirting with Dawn, the engaged receptionist with hopes for a bigger future.

This is a truly funny show with memorable characters and a great ironic portrayal of British office life.  The only disappointment is that there are not more than six episodes on this DVD.  One can only hope there will be more to come.",1117584000,,1089,4.907103825136612

So if you need canned laughter in your diet for the funny parts to be pointed out, maybe this show isn't for you.

My first warning to this show is when i heard one of my former bosses describe it as 'soooo funny.' Being around her is like being trapped in a room with the characters from this show: dull, dry and humorless.

There were a couple moments where i smiled, but building an entire show around awkward silences does not make a lasting comedy. If you have netflix, rent the first disk of season 1 to give it a try, but don't pay anything for it.",1104710400,16,549,4.269230769230769
1899939,5,B00009ZY9E,"The first time I knew about the Office was when it won the Gloden Globe for best comedy (the only foreign show to win in Gloden Globe history) and they showed this little clip of David Brent talking straight to the documentary crew's camera.  In the beginning, he is talking about something with serious conviction and then he starts getting politically correct and I just started laughing out loud (literally my gut was twisting).  That's when I knew this is the show.  Unfortunately, I forgot after the Gloden Globe awards. Luckily, I stumbled upon it in my local library and started watching the 1st season.  I usually don't order DVD's online or buy something if I have access to it very often, but after watching just one episode, I went to my computer and ordered both seasons of the series.  This the best thing ever happened to TV.  I can watch this series forever (not watching everyday as a habit but watching it very often) and still find little clues and deeper meaning of the comedy/drama.  If you have witty humor or just want to see what's all the fuss about the Office, I highly recommend you buy both seasons and the upcoming Office Special.  The only show that even comes close to its wit is Arrested Development.

So What's about? Well, it is about few peoples life in a small paper company office.  The characters are real and the humor is not like your average sitcom comedy but deep, witty remarks that once you understand you'll be crying from laughing so hard.  Try not to watch it with the idea that 'this show is very intelligent and I need to analyze' but simply watch the seasons once and go back and watch them again and you'll know what you have missed the first time. This is a show that more you watch the better it makes you feel about understanding the show.  If Orson Welles' ""Citizen Kane"" is the most important movie in history of cinema than ""Office"" is the most intellegent, funny, witty and best comedy series in history of television (I can't wait for the creators to come up with another series).",1100304000,9,2038,4.553424657534246

I feel like this theory applies to the humor in this series.  If you've ever worked in an office for any period of time, then this show might have you in tears from laugher.  You just might be able to relate.  I nearly seem to be able to breathe while watching the show because I'm laughing so much.

Also, like the other DVDs of ""The Office"" this is ridiculously overpriced for the amount of material on the DVD.

1899942,5,B00009ZY9E,"The funniest parts of this show are so uncomfortable that you don't know whether you should laugh or cry. But in the end your darker sense of humor will get the better of you, and you'll find yourself laughing at things you've never dared find humorous before.

That being said, Ricky Gervais is a comic genius. Not only does he play Boss David Brent to his painfully pleasurable perfection, but his improv skills are untouchable; timing impeccable. Gervais admits in the supplementary interviews on disc 2 that his sole purpose in this show is to improvise so much (and so well) that he'll cause the other actors to break out into laugher mid-take. The cast and crew hate him for it, but can't get enough of it nonetheless.

Over the first season of The Office, we meet the employees of Wernham Hogg, the paper company where ""life is stationery."" Manager David Brent is a boss so dumb, yet so happily innocent and friendly, he has no concept that he disgusts and traumatizes everyone he meets. Meanwhile, self-proclaimed Team Leader Gareth is a caricature of every nightmare co-worker you've every worked with, all rolled into one unbearable character. Tim is the textbook every-man, so fed up with his co-workers he wants nothing more than to leave this horrible chapter of life behind and start over. However, he is kept there by Dawn the soft-spoken receptionist, the girl he loves that unfortunately belongs to another man.

The mockumentary style of the show is much like that of Reno 911. It's set up like a reality show, but rather you get a parody of reality. However, with The Office, the humor is at times so dark and so unexpected, you can barely watch. It certainly has a cringe-factor like nothing I've ever experienced in television. The show is definitely NOT for everybody, so if that doesn't sound like your cup of tea, stay away.

On disc 1, you get all 6 half-hour episodes. Disc 2 has a few deleted scenes and a behind-the-scenes documentary. The documentary is very much worth watching, not only for the outtakes, but also for Gervais's discussion of improv on the set. There isn't much here for extras, but it seems very adequate for a mere 3-hour series.

Depending on your sense of humor, one of two things will happen after seeing this show. You could, of course, hate this show entirely due to the increasingly uncomfortable humor. But if that's not the case, it will raise the bar for comedy far beyond what you know. I think this is an amazing show in its uniqueness and fortitude. It truly goes where no comedy has gone before. If Season 2 is even half as good, it too will be another winner.",1092614400,6,2622,4.666666666666667

1899944,5,B00009ZY9E,"True, The Office is one of the funniest television shows you're likely to see anytime soon.  It doesn't have the sitcom formula of other BBC shows like Coupling, but makes you laugh through its keen understanding and observation of the familiar, mundane, and redundant.
However, several episodes in, while I was laughing hysterically at the insanity of David, Gareth, and the nightmare of nightmares, Finchy, my focus turned to Tim and Dawn, whom you could tell share a real chemistry.  By the time the final episode came to a close, I was smiling and crying, realizing that I had just seen a show capable of reaching out to all of my emotions, and all I wanted to do was watch the next season, which sadly, is the last.  It's not until you see the Christmas 2003 Special that everything comes full-circle.
I believe it's this sense of care for the characters (even David) that makes the series an enduring, three-dimensional piece of television.  It has the ability to make you take an outside look at your own existence if you work in an office/cubicle environment, acting as either a humorous form of therapy, or as the inspiration to take the next step in your career or personal life.",1089676800,5,1189,4.701923076923077
1899945,5,B00009ZY9E,"If you crossed ""Office Space"" with ""Spinal Tap,"" you might end up with something like ""The Office."" This hit British comedy defies the usual sitcom rules, and brings us into the cringingly dull world of a paper corporation, all delivered with straight-faced wit and hilarity.
Wernham Hogg is a suburban paper corporation, a stunningly dull place to work. And presiding over it is David Brent (Ricky Gervais), a wannabe comic who claims to be a pal to all the people under him, despite driving them all up the wall. There's also his partner in crime, vaguely corpse-like Gareth (Mackenzie Crook), the downtrodden everyman Tim (Martin Freeman), and the beautiful Dawn (Lucy Davis), whom Tim hopelessly longs for.
In the first season, David is informed that either his branch or another branch are going to be eliminated. If his branch is eliminated, some people will be downsized, and others relocated. The employees -- including Tim and Dawn -- reexamine their lives as they struggle to survive in the day-to-day chaos, including a Web porn scandal, a quiz competition, giant inflatable genitals, drunken carousing, inter-office romances, and Gareth playing detective.
Don't expect a typical sitcom in ""The Office."" No laughtracks. No punch lines. No gag humor... well, not much. And no episode has a clear-cut ending. Instead, we have the format seen in ""This is Spinal Tap"" and the Christopher Guest mockumentaries -- hidden cameras watching the madness. And what those cameras see is enough to make the world's cubicle-dwellers cry.
The series gets off to a slightly bumpy start -- at first, the jokes are a bit too thinly-spread. But soon ""The Office"" gets its footing and the humor steadies itself (""Tim's put my stapler inside a jelly again. That's the third time he's done it!"" Gareth complains, displaying the stapler in a Jell-O mold). And a lot of the humor is a subversive, subtle kind -- it creeps into your mind, and by episode two you'll be laughing your head off at David's bad jokes and veiled prejudices.
Ricky Gervais is brilliant. David is every bit as annoying and obnoxious as the immortal Basil Fawlty, but hides it under a genial mask and stupid jokes. Mackenzie Crook is wonderful as the obsequious boot-licker. Tim, like Dilbert, is a lovable loser who can't get himself out of his soul-sucking job. And Dawn is mired in a relationship with an obnoxious cheapskate.
More subtle and yet goofier than American sitcoms, ""The Office"" is a unique slice of British humor. Funny, witty, and horrifyingly true to life, this is a brilliant series.",1088985600,6,2562,4.9743589743589745

Yes, I do get it, but I'll tell you, this is one series that has to grow on you.  The humor is rather dry at first, and you really need to spend the time learning everyone's personalities (Gareth -- I love you!).  Once you get over the ""learning"" hump, you will love The Office.

The first episode was more confusing than anything else.  Done in a documentary style, it chronicled the goings on within, of all interesting venues, a paper company, and followed the relationships between its completely pathetic inhabitants.  The office constituency is led by (co-writer of the show) Ricky Gervais who plays David Brent...a cocktail of extreme insecurity, arrogance, and level of social ineptitude that pushes (but doesn't cross) the envelope of possibility.
I'll embarrasingly admit that the unorthodox style took a while to get used to, from no laugh track, to a complete absence of jokes or punch lines.  This show plays on a variation of the axiom about ""truth being stranger than fiction"".  Well, after an episode or two, I became totally immersed in the environment, an environment that seemed more like reality than fiction.  That threw my switch, I now find this show insanely funny, but the realistic element has a gravity of its own.  You start to really care about the characters.  Pretty unusual for a comedy series.

It's refreshing to watch a show this funny, where the structure and writing feel real, and do not insult the viewer's intelligence. Unfortunately, there are only two seasons in this series. From personal experience working in several urban offices, I think there's enough people with stories and situations out there, that the writers could have found more material and created one more strong season.

1899956,5,B00009ZY9E,"From the moment David Brent comes on the screen, he suddenly becomes every bad boss you've ever had and ever hated, without ever doing anything horribly offensive or rotten that all of your bad bosses have done. Such is the genius of the BBC comedy ""The Office"", slowly taking the US by storm, by being both brilliantly funny and wickedly sincere.
The brain child of Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, ""The Office"" brings us into the exciting world of the paper business, led into battle by the horribly camera-mugging David Brent (played by Gervais), who is aptly clueless in his verbal running-of-the-mouth. Acutely aware of the cameras which have invaded his office, making his work life into a pseudo-reality show. Brent is fidgety aware of the camera, often looking it during one of his hilarious monologues, and also as he attempts to ""be one of the guys"" in the office. The results are not punch-line funny, but deeper truth funny.
Adding to Brent's insanity are a supportive cast of incredible actors that add so much to the Office. Martin Freeman's Tim, who plays the office clown but also carries the more melancholy aspects of his job with him; Mackenzie Crook's Gareth, as a perfect foil to Tim as a brown nosing assistant with a huge inferiority complex; Lucy Davis' Dawn, a strong-willed receptionist who I secretly suspect is the smart one of the bunch.; to the rest of the office staff who are required to act by looking, and the looks they give are pricelessly funny.
What I began to appreciate about the series is that beyond the humor, the people in the office are terribly real. It's in their realness that the humor trannscends. When we see Dawn burst into tears because of an inappropriate practical joke Brent plays on her, when we see Tim brooding in the local bar because of his situation, when we see Brent caught in the middle of some lies he tells to save face; it's funny, and painful, and more strong because these people are real, complex. The humor comes from them, and doesn't happen to them, which is more real.
The first season is only six episodes, but worthy of the price for the many, many, many laughs The Office will bring you. I eagerly can't wait for the second season, and hope that American comedies learn something from this series destined to be a quiet classic.",1083369600,5,2309,4.703703703703703

The quite lovely Lucy davis grr... as quiet and emotional receptionist Dawn is particulary great as well. Other great performances also come from Martin Freeman as nice guy Tim, and Ewan Mcintosh as the deathly silent Keith.",1081036800,6,700,4.793388429752066
1899962,5,B00009ZY9E,"I'll admit... I waited some time before buying The Office.  I own a Region-free DVD player so I purchase Brit Coms usually before the arrive in the US.  I have all the classics, and usually, before the DVD main title, there is a teaser video with several scenes from various titles... The Office was one.  Although you may think humor is humor.. culture differences might make something funny in the UK seem silly in the US, and vice versa.  I'm glad I waited because I fully appreciate the thought and writing of this series (same with People Like Us.)  Everyone at some point has worked in or near an office.  People come everyday and do a job, then interact with each other during break-time periods.  It's the uncomfortable situations created by unique personalities that make this show great.  Without naming every character in the show... just think what if a TV camera crew came into your office for one week and filmed your staff... Ever see a group of co-workers talking, and one person makes an off color comment, over the line of good taste...

1899963,4,B00009ZY9E,"""The Office"" is the type of comedy that is bound to get mixed reviews. Ignore the people who say it is terrible - it is way too creative to be dismissed. Equally ignore those who so it's just SOOO funny - not really, not even the intent actually. What makes this series special is the blending of comedy and the dark twisted reality of the workplace. The main character is the office manager David Brent. He will remind you of people you have seen in the corporate world regardless of where you are in the world. At times you'll want to physically strike him. At other times you'll consider stopping the DVD. Some of the moments and characters are just that infuriating and embarrassing. However those qualities are what elevate ""The Office"" above the run of the mill. In order to make something that borders on being called art you have to push the envelope and this does.",1080691200,4,873,4.531645569620253
1899964,4,B00009ZY9E,"The Office takes some getting used to. It manages to be hilariously funny without making you laugh, instead you cringe and squirm with embarrassment at David Brent and his 'enlightened' take on senior management. It's funny, but also painful to watch. It's hilarious but the laughs are few and far between. Maybe it's because its too close to the bone - anybody who's worked in an office environment in the 80s or 90s will most likely have first-hand experience of the buffoonery that passes for leadership.
It's a good job Gareth is there - we can all laugh at his inept social skills and lack of any kind of redeeming feature - because otherwise the Office would be close to unbearable so close is the line between comedy and blackness. Take Brent's chum Finchy, for instance. You can't laugh at a guy like that, you just pray you never have to meet anyone like him. The Office mimics the earnest mockumentary style of Spinal Tap but is less far-fetched and therefore more scary.  The Office takes some getting used to, but that's probably because it is a first-rate comedy that manages to make you want to cry instead of laugh. In fact, the shenanigans of the Office are probably being played out at this very momentin a workplace near you.",1080604800,4,1243,4.65

You maybe miss out on 10-15% of the jokes, but you get the gist of what's going on.

It is the same kind of mockumentary Christopher Guest became famous with. Whole action happens in the office of some paper company. The acting is very very good, which is amasing considering that it is mostly semiprofessional actors. Ricky Gervalis is very funny. At the same time, despite all this laughing the movie leaves a sad feeling after the first series when you watch as some nice people cannot find thir place in life and how 'office' consumes them. Highly recommended!",1078444800,4,591,4.6923076923076925
1899978,5,B00009ZY9E,"Every time David Brent (Ricky Gervais) starts fiddling with his tie I get anxious.  It is like hearing the sound of an artillery shell coming at you and wanting to yell ""Incoming.""  Yes, I know I am contrasting a visual clue with an aural clue, but my point, vis-a-vis ""The Office: The Complete First Series,"" would be, to wit, on point in the same way taking a round hole and finding a square peg to put into it would make a modicum of sense, in a round about way.
We live sheltered lives up here in the Northland, so I had never seen ""The Office"" nor heard much about it until the BBC series won the Golden Globe for Best Television Series: Musical or Comedy and Gervais won for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series: Musical or Comedy.  But that was enough to check it out.  Since this is a British situation comedy there are only a handful of episodes, six to be exact, so we are spared from the sub-par and totally wasted episodes that so many American sitcoms are bloated with (is there going to be even one more great ""Friends"" episode before the grand finale?).  The result is an instant cult classic in the mode of ""Police Squad,"" another limited run sitcom series that inhabited its own little comedy world.
""The Office"" is the Slough office of Werham Hogg, manufacturer of paper products, where David Brent is the office manager.  The key story arc of the first season is the company's impending decision to close either the Slough or Swindon branches and merge the two, which brings up the dreaded idea of ""redundancy.""  Brent talks about protecting his people but we are aware from the start that this guy is talk, all talk, all the time, and has achieved new levels of self-interest and self-absorption in the process.  There are also the interpersonal conflicts in the office, where the number two man in the office, Gareth Keenan (Mackenzie Crook) is blind to his own incompetence and Tim Canterbury (Martin Freeman) divides his time between making life difficult for Gareth, trying to connect with Brent's secretary Dawn Tinsley (Lucy Davis), and keeping on the good side of the man himself.
The six episodes from the first season consist of: (1) ""Downsize"" is where Brent is told that his branch might be closed down and absorbed by the other office.  Of course that would not be a popular thing to tell his workers, so Brent flies in the face of reason and tells them the exact opposite; (2) ""Work Experience"" presents Brent with two headaches, the first being a doctored pornographic image of himself sent over the company computers and the second a return visit from Jennifer Taylor Clark wanting to know what changes he has made to improve the office; (3) ""The Quiz"" starts with Tim's birthday and his various gifts (one of which is large and inflatable), but comes down to Tim and Ricky (Oliver Chris) against Brent and Finch (Ralph Ineson) in the office's annual trivia quiz contest; (4) ""Training"" is my favorite of the bunch as it is training day.  Of course Brent cannot play second fiddle to anybody and it is not long before he is livening up the boring session with some of his original musical compositions; (5) ""New Girl"" has Brent firing and hiring as the deadline for a decision comes closer while Tim is thinking of moving on; and (6) ""Judgement"" deals with redundancies judgement day and the choice that Brent has to make.  Of course, no selfish deed comes unpunished.
My only complaint is that given how Jennifer Taylor Clark (Stirling Gallacher) saw through Brent in episode two, how she can come back in episode four and have a different attitude.  I know the short answer is because Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant wrote it that way, but it only underscores that for ""The Office"" to work nobody above Brent on the corporate food chain can really know his true value.  Done in mockumentary style, just another piece of evidence that Brent's ego is too great to ever see the harm of having his every word being recorded by a camera, ""The Office"" is ultimately about a man who is trying to have it both ways.  Every time he tries to stay ahead of the game he falls farther and farther behind, with the one constant being that he basically never ever shuts up.  There is just something so compelling about watching such verbal self-immolating, especially when we are only talking about six episodes where only the fifth one is less than completely satisfactory.",1078185600,19,4414,4.662805662805662

This is a defining moment in combining comedy and reality tv. It really is a non sitcom comedy filmed in documentary style.  There are some very funny moments in this. There are incidents that are highly politically incorrect, that would be difficult to imagine happening in an American workplace without multi million dollar lawsuits taking place, yet in Britain you obviously can still get away with this stuff.

To me the strongest scene, was when he fired the receptionist as a practical joke for alleged gross misconduct to impress a new employee and it totally backfires.

1899982,5,B00009ZY9E,"Office politics seem to be the same on either side of the pond. There's always somebody pining for somebody else, always a brown noser, always a boss that seems not to know what the boundaries are with his/her employees. And it's not so funny to watch your own company go thru a downsizing, but it is enjoyable here.
This is done in the style of a reality type show. You get to see Tim pining after Dawn, who seems on some level to be encouraging him. You see Tim play practical jokes on Gareth, who seems to _need_ practical jokes played on him. And David Brent, ah, what a piece of work he is.  Whatever you have done, he has done better and been more successive. He is the ""buddy boss"" - the kind who pretends to be concerned about you but is really just looking for an audience. And the kind that would pat you on the back looking for a soft place to stick the knife.
Be aware this show is similiar to spending the day in a dysfunctional office. It's funny in the way ""Dilbert"" is funny until you recognize pieces of your worklife on the screen or in the funny pages. As my family watched, we would point out  situations and say ""hey remember Ron at the UltraMegaOmniGlobal* place..."" and we'd laugh - partially because we don't work there anymore.
I recommend this seiries highly - but remember, it's _just- a tv show - it's not you who are stuck in that particular realm of Hell. Or if you are, maybe you can laugh about it.

1899983,5,B00009ZY9E,"As improvisational humor goes these days, you can't really expect much.  Sure, ""Joe Schmoe"" had some interesting moments with its ""Cast"" of players...who in the end were all actors.  Then there's Curb Your Enthusiasm, a not so ""Enthusiastic"" show about not so interesting people in staged/improved situations (although there is a basic script.  But Larry David, and Improve Comic, much prefers his take on it, even if it's rather humorless and tasteless).  Then, a gem comes along like ""The Office"".
Is it a documentary?  Is it a TV show?  Is it reality tv?  In essence, it doesn't really matter.  On a basic level, it's about the chaos that ensues in a location that no one really wants to be working at in the first place...it's where 90% of people here and abroad will end up working...and it's a place for very high tension.
All of these factors working together produce very funny situations that are both played as low key events and high brow or mid range farce (again, very subdued).  They stretch reality on some level.  But on some level, you bring yourself to believe that something like this could ""actually"" happen.  You laugh because of the irony, the logic or lack there of, and the conflict of interests of the characters.  And you laugh because the british still have a better sense of TV comedy than we ever will.
With all of the Two Guys a Girl and a Pizza Places, the Two and a Half Mens, and the shameful Whoopies (though we still love ya girl!), The Office is the breath of fresh air from across the sea that the world of comedy has been looking for.  My advice, pick up the first season, grab some popcorn, and be prepared for a wake up call for your funny bone.

1899984,5,B00009ZY9E,"The Office is a comedy without a laugh track or studio audience, it is shot in a mockumentary style which makes it have to succeed on its own merits and not cued signs telling people when to laugh.  It not only is funny, but brilliant.
Set around a fictional paper company in the rough and tumble London suburb of Slough (pronounced sl-ow, now slow), it is helmed by four primary characters all of whom are masterfully acted.  The plot evolves to a breaking point where the manager David Brent must choose a promotion or saving his office as the company is making redundancies.  The end result is hilarious, but getting there is half the fun.
The DVD is a different experience and the pace of the show is better as the presentation on BBCAmerica is with adverts, unlike its original showing in the UK.

Some people may find it hard to get into (my Dad still hates it) but watch it again and again and you'll begin to see what everyone else is talking about.

BTW the monkey you see in The Office (on the Coat peg - which Brent points at) is famous from an Ad for a company which provided the first terrestrial digital tv.  Sadly that company went down the tubes making the gag even funnier.

1899995,5,B00009ZY9E,"Meet David Brent (Ricky Gervais) a self indulgent boss of Wernham Hogg's Paper merchant branch located in the drab suburb of Slough. David Brent thinks he's the most popular and comical Boss in the whole of the UK, if not the world. To add to his self delusion, Gareth Keenan (Mackenzie Crook) plays Teacher's Pet and spurs on Brent's rude and sometimes obnoxious behaviour.
Playing the voice of reason is Tim Canterbury (Martin Freeman) who out of all the characters we can relate to the most. As he does the slight looks to camera, as if asking if we can see the torment he goes through everyday in this office. While playing the Juliet to his Romeo is Dawn Tinsley (Lucy Davis) the receptionist of Wernham Hogg who also shares the same ideals as Tim and tries to keep sane by illustrating. She is caught between the Boss's rude and not so wise cracking jokes and the love that was never meant to be between herself and Tim.
There are six episodes in the first season, each 30 minutes long. Six episodes you may not think is enough but The Office has mastered something that most other sitcoms have not, Quality over Quantity. And I think this shows by the series beating out the other sitcoms in the Golden Globe Awards who are in their final seasons.
The first time you watch this show you'll be in amazement at the Idiosyncrasies that each of the four main protagonists convey. You will also no doubt relate one of the stars to someone in your own workplace and cringe at what they do just to impress the camera. When watching this show, I find, that you don't think of it as a sitcom, you actually think of it as a real workplace being captured on film in a documentary style. Its just so believable.
Below are a brief summary of each of the episodes.
Episode 1 - Here we are introduced to the office workplace and the people involved. A young protege (Ricky) is also brought in for work experience as David Brent tries to lay down how relaxed and great the office is even though there has been word that the branch may be downsized.
Episode 2 - David hires Donna, a family friend's daughter and shows her around the office. While doing so he finds that his head has been photoshopped onto a pornagraphic image. Gareth is sent to find the culprit.
Episode 3 - Here we witness Quiz night at Slough and see how truly awful people can get when liquored up and in a competition environment. The quiz night boils down to a head to head between Brent and Finch V. Ricky and Tim on his 30th Birthday.
Episode 4 - To help keep good teamwork in the office a workplace seminar in conducted. Brent reveals that he is a singer/songwriter while Rowan tries to keep the seminar moving. Dawn and her Boyfriend (Lee) have a falling out while Tim quits his job and asks out Dawn.
Episode 5 - Gareth gives Donna Health and Safety Training while Brent hires a new secretary even though he's supposed to be downsizing. All the Office goes down to a local nightclub, Chasers, while David tries to get lucky with the ladies.
Episode 6 - Jennifer (Head Boss) informs David that either his branch or Swindon's branch will be downsized depending on if he accepts the role of UK manager or not.
EXTRAS - 40 minute documentary of how the Office was made and Deleted Scenes.
The Office hits on a simple yet universal relationship with love and work. Everyone can relate to being in a job that they hate and people who don't work as hard being promoted before they do.
This is the first British show that has ever been nominated for 2 Golden Globes and wins them both first time (Best TV Comedy, Best Comedy Actor). Do yourself a favour and see what this show has to offer above all others. This is comedic genius at its best.

An American remake is on its way, but I'm not keeping my hopes up.  Many compare THE OFFICE to classic mockumentaries like THIS IS SPINAL TAP and WAITING FOR GUFFMAN.  I think it takes its place, not only in the pantheon of mockumentaries, but in British comedy.

I will say that I do enjoy the show's unique approach and starkly arid humor that is presented with no attempt to point up the comedy, which is simply left to the viewer to find. While it is often compared to This Is Spinal Tap, because of its documentary style, The Office is more like a Beckett-infused version of NewsRadio. The show is not very accessible to a new viewer, since no introductions are made, and there is little deliberate exposition, but this also contribute to the reality of it. Ultimately, this is the central issue addressed in the DVD.
The biggest inclusion on the DVD is the Wernham-Hogg ""newsletter"" that includes profiles on all the major and most of the minor characters, which is helpful breaking viewers in. More important is an extensive ""Slough Speak"" dictionary, which helps the Yanks (like myself) understand the heavy British slang that is used, and provides perspective on many choices in the series (like why it is located in Slough). The is actually printed out, not throw on the DVD (like some other purchases I ave made) so that you can have it out while you watch.
The second disc includes a documentary on the makng of, which features Ricky Gervais bizarrely staying in character (I hope. If the real Ricky is that much like David Brent, this comedy becomes sadder indeed.) which contributes to overall odd-funny atmosphere of the show.

1900004,5,B00009ZY9E,"This show has been absolutely huge here in the UK and David Brent (the boss from hell) has become a national icon. Not only has it been massively popular with the general public but it has also received universal critical acclaim. This has benefited several of the cast members who have recently featured in movies. Mackenzie Crook who plays the loathsome geek Gareth was in Pirates of the Caribbean (the pirate with the wooden eye) and Martin Freeman, who plays Tim the nice guy underachiever, was in Love Actually.
As these reviews are for the Yank market I have to warn you that it's probably unlike any comedy show you've seen before. It's a pseudo documentary based almost entirely in a small office (hence The Office) with no canned laughter. I won't go into more detail about the show as other reviewers have already covered most of the bases. But if you're a blue collar worker who's ever wondered what goes on in an office environment then this is for you and if you are familiar with an office environment then this DVD is an absolute must - unless you're an overweight middle manager with a goatee and your facing downsizing sometime soon.

1900005,5,B00009ZY9E,"Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant's The Office is all that the other reviewers said and more.  Painful, pitiful, cringe-making, and hilarious; this ""reality"" look at office life is strangely addictive.  A Christmas gift, I was initially putting off viewing this series (especially after the recent announcement that an American remake will be out soon - yech!).  And after the first episode, I was already wincing at the idea of being in the same room with David Brent for another 2 1/2 hours.  After seeing all 6 episodes, though, I can't wait for series 2 to reach the US!
The other reviewers have really said it all about this series, so I'll just add my agreement to the raves.  I just wanted to suggest that if you liked The Office's mockumentary style and painfully realistic portrayal of clueless stupidity, check out Canada's Trailer Park Boys.",1072915200,7,853,4.895833333333333
1900006,5,B00009ZY9E,"As I am a UK resident, I have both Series 1 and 2 of the office on DVD... I'm not sure if the second series has yet been released in the USA.
Ricky Gervais has declared that there will be no third series, which is a shame but is also understandable - I'd probably do the same myself, such a level of attainment could not possibly be sustained. But... read on, for there IS a 'but'...
I write this review still under the spell of not one, but two, count them, TWO, Christmas Specials of The Office which have just been broadcast here in Britain on consecutive days.
No spoilers here, but I will say that the second and final episode is marked by genius; of course it will make you laugh, but if you don't also shed a tear (when you finally get to see it in America) then you are a harder man than I.
Yes, the BrentMeister is a total ass, a celebration of all that is grotesque, but I know I won't be alone in thinking that there is also a lot to like about him; certainly he's a better man than the disgusting wholesome new boss Neil who is so admirably contrasted against him.
Hats off to writers Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant; a towering achievement.",1072656000,5,1156,4.235294117647059
1900007,5,B00009ZY9E,"One thing that you must understand about this mockumentary- is that it is meant to come across as real as possible.  For those who would write that it is boring, slow, dry, or dull, try to think about your own work environment.  The greatest part of this show is that Gervais has captured many of the rediculous behaviours that take place around offices every where.  The two best elements of the show are the writing- which is amazing; and the acting- possibly even better than the writing.
  The one thing that amazed me most was the character development.  As a viewer, I felt (by the end of the first episode) like I was a part of this particular office and was annoyed on a daily basis with David Brent- the painfully ignorant, yet comical (in that kind of laughing at you way) and his sidekick-Gareth.  The uncomfortable feeling you get watching Tim flirt with David's secretary, not quite knowing whether it would develop into anything else- all the while wondering: ""would this follow the organizations ethical standards?""  The parties thrown in order to build team spirit and show appreciation for the workers- only to turn into dull wastes of time for those who attend.  Practically every office scenario that could occur, actually does in this series- and always in a way that makes you shake your head.
  You can't help feeling bad for the workers of this office, and yet almost ashamed that a part of what is going on there is what actually goes on where you work.  This series touches upon all that SHOULD be laughed at with corporate office environments and does a very good job of keeping it short and sweet.
  Literally only four hours long total, I recommend this highly to anyone that has ever thought that they have wasted their time with an organization.",1072396800,7,1775,4.683870967741935
1900008,5,B00009ZY9E,"This is set in a grimly recognizable version of hell: a paper supply company's office in the unfortunate town of Slough (previously best know for John Betjamin's invitation to ""friendly bombs"" to fall on it.) Into this environment comes a T.V. crew set on making a fly-on-the-wall documentary about office life. That documentary is what we see. This media attention is a dream come true for the manager David Brent, who is convinced his entry into office life has been a tragic loss to the world of show business, and comedy in particular. He's wrong: he isn't funny. His jokes fall into an oblivion of silence and embarrassment. And yet he is also right as this idle, incompetent, selfish, petty, stupid and self-deluded character, as played by Ricky Gervais, is one of the most painfully, appallingly hilarious creatures ever dreamt up and put on a T.V. screen.
If Brent is a monster, he remains perhaps quite likeable compared to his best mate, the appallingly obnoxious ""Finchy"" and his second in command Gareth, the ""team leader"". Gareth, brilliantly acted by Mackenzie Crook, is a character, like Brent, largely defined by his Walter Mittyish fantasy of who he would like to be. In Brent's case the fantasy is the Comic Genius, in Gareth's it is The Soldier. He is the perfect representation of the hopeless loser whose sad macho fantasies of being Jean Claude van Damme get played out hilariously scaled down in the appallingly petty landscape of his life.
This really ought not to be funny. It's less like watching most comedy than it is like watching a horrible road accident in slow motion. It is desperately funny, the way some passages in Samuel Beckett are desperately funny. It's a picture of modern British (and I suspect not only British) working life at its most unspeakably awful and a study in how not to go about being a human being. What mainly makes it funny is simply that it is so completely brilliant. The writing by Gervais and Stephen Merchant is as good as has ever been done for television by anyone. With a deadly knack for social observation and a marvellous ear for dialogue (and monologue), they have created a wonderful collection of characters who are at once utterly monstrous and utterly believable. That done, they have then managed to get these parts handed out to actors who have managed simply to become them with total credibility. British television comedy has produced nothing better than this. (And the preceding sentence would still be true with the word ""British"" removed.)",1072224000,21,2520,4.876456876456876

1900010,5,B00009ZY9E,"What do you get when you take Waiting For Guffman and put it in a business setting? You get ""The Office,"" the British sitcom that is ferociously breaking into American culture. This 2 DVD set contains the first season of ""The Office,"" as well as a behind the scenes documentary of the making and creation of the show. Enjoy it now before we have the sure-to-be stupid American version of it on NBC or ABC, which will likely perform about as well as the disastrous ""Coupling"" import.
""The Office"" shows us the day-to-day lives of the employees of Wernham Hogg paper company, led by the insufferable boss David Brent (Ricky Gervais, the shows co-writer and co-creator). While David is usually the focus of each episode, the show contains a very deep supporting cast, including Gareth, the military-trained assistant-to-the-manager, Tim, the anti-Gareth, who he's constantly warring with, and his in-office romantic interest Dawn, the everyday-pretty secretary.
If you are familiar with the films of Christopher Guest - Waiting For Guffman, Spinal Tap, Best In Show, A Mighty Wind - then you'll be right at home with ""The Office."" It's filmed in the simplistic and usually funny ""mockumentary"" style. For reasons never named in the show, there are cameramen throughout the Wernham Hogg offices filming the daily activities of all the employees, as well as conducting frequent and insightful interviews with the characters.
Enough of that - here's why the show is brilliant: You know everyone in the cast. At one time or another, you have met David Brent. Maybe he was your own boss once. Gareth was that psycho kid in study hall that always read Guns and Ammo and always insisted on showing you some Judo throw he'd recently learned. Tim is the nice guy that the pretty girls always took advantage of. You'll even see aspects of yourself in all the characters.
And it's the characters that make this show such a success. When you watch the first episode, you'll laugh a few times, a chuckle here and there. Then the second episode will yield more laughs as you get to know the quirks of the characters a little more. By episode three, everything becomes funny. It's this fact that makes it difficult to introduce the show to people, since it contains a great deal of humor that is only funny once you're familiar with the characters.
The runaway star of the show is Gervais as David Brent. He has a world-class ability to always say the wrong thing at the right time. More than anything he is proud of his comedic ability and cherishes this as the highest virtue of corporate bosses. The problem? He's not funny. Not intentionally anyway. Every joke is carried too far and in the course of trying to be England's most politically correct man, he manages to insult practically every race and every woman in the office.
Lastly, this DVD is worth buying not only for the repeat watching value, but also for the behind-the-scenes look at the show, which is almost funnier than the episodes themselves. Both Gervais and co-director Stephen Merchant are hilarious throughout it and you realize that Gervais can't not be funny. You get interviews with all the important cast, and you'll see several minutes of brilliant outtakes where the actors can't get three lines into the scene before losing it.
The only negative reviews of the show speak to the similarity of the episodes and that they are hard to distinguish between one another. This might be valid, but I don't necessarily think it's a negative factor. In the DVD itself, the episodes are not separated but are listed as a sequence of scenes, six per episode. This says it more clearly than I ever could - the shows are all meant to be taken as one continuing episode, much like the monotonous days of office labor. I think it's one of the more reality based shows I've seen, unlike another recent reviewer who thought Seinfeld was more realistic. That's too stupid a comment to even defend here. The bottom line - if you work in an office, you'll instantly recognize the humor in your own day to day life. If you don't, then after watching ""The Office,"" you'll thank God for it.",1071187200,6,4129,4.776223776223776

1900014,5,B00009ZY9E,"The Office is to sitcoms what The Sopranos has been to television dramas: a redefinition of the genre, and one that makes all others in their category seem second rate by comparison.
Ricky Gervais has perfectly captured the absurdities of office life and filled his characters with real personality. Only a few are less than three dimensional--Chris Finch and Lee come to mind--but the rest are all human. Tim is a witty but wimpy lonely heart, Gareth an arrogant but vulnerable pain in the rear, Dawn a needy user--even David Brent, the manager/standup comedian who rumbles from one awkward conversation to the next, has enough humanity that you can feel sorry for him in all but his most asinine moments.
The first season of The Office was the greatest inaugural season in sitcom history.
Get it while you can, though: episodes of the second season aired on the BBC have been more angry and cruel--and less funny--and Ricky Gervais has said from the start there will be no third season.",1069200000,3,988,4.817647058823529
1900015,5,B00009ZY9E,"When this series was first shown in the UK, there were some who assumed it was a documentary, possibly a management education programme filmed by the BBC Business Unit.  There is no laughter track, and there are frequent shots of people doing not very much and photocopiers collating paper.  The first-line manager (David Brent) was so incompetent that this must be the 'Before' section before the consultants moved in and transformed the company.
But no, once viewers got it, and saw that David Brent was never going to improve (and would never do any work either), the BBC realised it had a major winner on its hands.
But perhaps the most extraordinary part of the story is that the BBC should give total control of the writing, direction and acting to Ricky Gervaise and his collaborator Stephen Merchant.  Ricky Gervaise, a fortysomething, had had no acting or directing experience.  He had never been to acting or scriptwriting classes.  His only contact with the media was in the 1980s when he was a member of a failed pop group.  Before he made this series, he was the manager of the students union bar at one of the London university colleges.
What happened was that, for his graduate training course at the BBC, Stephen Merchant had to create a 10-minute short.  With Gervaise, he created a prototype of the Office, and the BBC liked it so much that they gave the partnership a series.  It's hard to imagine that happening in the US, which tends to value training and experience rather more highly.
In truth, Gervaise plays a character very close to his own persona.  Here is a manager who plays the guitar and wants to be a comedian.  It is that closeness to reality that lends the series such a genuine feel.  Also contributing to the feeling of reality is the sparseness of comic characters.  There are only two seriously abnormal people in that office -- Brent himself and Gareth, the weekend soldier with a penchant for childish electronic toys.  The rest are, I have to confess, very true to life in the English workplace.
The plot, such as it is, is not worth giving away here.  Suffice to say, there is just one more series (of a further six episodes).  There will be a holiday special, but otherwise the whole Office has been canned -- not for lack of popularity, but simply because Gervaise and Merchant do not believe they can better it.",1069200000,3,2357,4.673123486682809
1900016,5,B00009ZY9E,"When The Office was first shown to a UK audience back in 2001, it was shown on BBC2. That is the secondary BBC channel where shows that aren't supposed to be popular are first aired. It's no surprise then that when The Office was repeated, its audience share was much greater second time around. A good reputation goes a long way.
Gervais and Merchant hit the spot with this DVD, containing 6, 30 minute episodes that comprise Series One as well as a lengthy interview with the 2 which comes complete with outtakes, deleted scenes and early verions of The Office.
The timescale of the Series is only a few weeks but oh so much is crammed in here from training days to nights out to Brent's philosophical musings to camera.
Merchant and Gervais admitted that they'd run out of ideas after Series 2. This is evident (Series 2 is good, nothing like Series 1, though) and this is also why we will only ever have 12 episodes plus one Christmas Special.
Sure there are many Brit 'in-jokes' that the average American will not get but there is so much more than they will not distract you from laughing.",1069113600,,1095,4.507537688442211
1900017,5,B00009ZY9E,"Rather than merely parrot the acclaim already accorded the show by other reviewers, I will simply point up a few of the lesser lights, as it were. Ricky Gervais' performance is so wonderful that it overshadows two 'b' themes from the show: Tim and Dawn's attraction and Tim's feelings about his job.
Dawn's fiance is an ass and is obviously wrong for her, but she stays with him. Tim is a thirtyish college dropout who longs for success in his field of choice, if only he knew what that was. In both cases the characters long for something more, but their own insecurities keep them locked in their paths.
Ultimately, it's about settling. It's about that moment (around your thirtieth birthday, or it was for me, at any rate) when you realize that you're not going to be a rock star. When you realize that though your mother thinks you're special, you're just one of 5,999,999,999 other nobodies-in-particular, and maybe that's OK. After several years of hard knocks, you start to crave the comfort of certainty over the thrill of risking it all for your One Big Break. Dawn clings to her fiance because he's a sure thing, if a lousy one. Tim says that he's going to quit and go back to school, but ends up taking a ""promotion"". Better the devil you know....
<<SPOILER>>
In the final episode of season two, we get to see why it's easier to follow this path. After Tim's initial humiliation in season one, when he asks Dawn out and is shot down in front of his coworkers, he tries again after he learns that Dawn has given her notice and is leaving for the States with her fiance. He takes her into a conference room and pours out his feelings for her (or so we assume -- before entering, he removes his microphone, leaving the camera to peer voyeuristically through the blinds. And why not -- we've all seen this scene before). When he returns to his desk he plugs back in his mic, faces the camera and says, ""She said no."" An American show would have had them in bed by episode two. Brilliant, simply brilliant.",1069113600,2,2012,4.515068493150685

Ricky Gervais' observations on human behavior in a typical office are so true to life, so acutely and agonizingly and hilariously well-observed, so marvelously accurate.
This series is not just about its unique and innovative humor. It also provides reassurance for many of us that we are not the only ones who notice that humdrum office life is deeply comical... and deeply tragic at the same time.
A lot of people say that they ""can't watch"". This is because though they are drawn to the humor, they'd prefer not to be reminded of the truth revealed by the darker side of Gervais' acute observations.
Go easy on the reviewers who say they ""Don't Get It""... At least ten percent of us must be Gareths or the equivalent. He'd never ""Get It"" either!",1068681600,4,805,4.597222222222222

His interrogation methods, ex-Territorial Army experience, title of Assistant (to the) Regional Manager, & his responsibilities as ""Team Leader."" His character is too funny... & it has the kind of potential for a spin off series.
Like to add that, I do believe the series gets better in Season 2 (and unfortunately, the last season? Say it ain't so Mr. Gervias). The second season manages to create more uncomfortable situations with the addition of Neil, who becomes David's boss (he is mentioned several times by Jenifer, as the Swindon branch manager who makes the necessary changes that David neglects) I look forward to seeing it released in the US VERY soon.

Intelligent, well written and featuring all manner of comedy, This is Spinal Tap has rightfully gone down in cult movie history as perhaps the best comedy of all time.  The Office has now done for Television what Tap did for movies.  Utterly original and painfully hilarious, each episode of The Office is a perfect forty minutes of comedy.  The genius of this show is not just the comedy but the depth of the characters.  Like the three leading men of Spinal Tap, Office inhabitants Gareth, Tim, Dawn and David are masterfully developed and acted.  While it is easy to point out the faults of David or Gareth, one soon finds out that neither of these guys are loathsome--just sad.  The Office reaffirms that realism is the best comedic form, and that mining the mundane for laughs can provide outstanding results. In six short episodes you already feel more for these characters than you ever could for Rachael, Ross, Joey and co.  Perhaps the best (and most discomforting) part about The Office is its underlying theme--that we all lie to ourselves, and do so in such a way and with such frequency that we can come to believe the lie.

If you have not seen The Office before, you are smiply missing the best comedy of all time. I admit, i enjoy the banter of 'friends' and 'Will And Grace', but there comes a time where this 'slapstick' comedey gets old.  However, this british import is not 'Ha ha' funny, it's 'Oh my god no!' funny. Your proabably now thinking what the hell am i on about. Well The Office is set in, believe it or not, an office. There is no added laughs, just simply the true british accent of pure genius. It is cruel, funny and interesting at the same time. Some might say it is slow with a few laughs, some say it is unwatchable. There is more that say it doesn't cease to amaze.
Going back to my original point, 'Why will you ruin this show?', please, do not watch your remake (which is already planned) before you watch the original version. Trust me, it won't be the same. Simply because o the passion and the acting. The acting in this show is the best of all time. From David Brent (Ricky Gervais) to Kieth (i don't know his name, but he is a star in the making). This show is unmissable on all accounts. Read the other reveiws for more on my view!

Ab Fab, Mr. Bean, Fawlty Towers, Monty Python, Yes, Minister to name a few. ""The Office"" is up there and, in my opinion, better. why is it so good? watch the second disk interview on this collection and you'll hear the creators talk about how they did not want to do a sitcom where jokes were set up for a laugh, they wanted to see the humor in everyday life. what a brilliant, refreshing idea. there are no lame one-liners in here. the comedy comes from remarkably well-drawn characters, which is something pot-boilers like ""friends"" lacks. most people i know who watched this couldn't figure it out at the beginning, but all have been hooked because of the depth and layers. U.S. sitcoms must produce 22 or so episodes per season. the brits demand 6, but since you can watch each episode 6-10 times and get something new and laugh harder each time, they're doing a better job.

There are those that think Brent and the other regular characters on the show are unsympathetic, shallow, mundane, and petty but I don't see it that way. Brent just wants to be loved and part of the gang - he's just to creepy/seedy/inappropriate to make that kind of connection with his employees. Gareth is a weasly ass face (or is that ass face weasel) with a background with the territorial army. He's another one that combines a mix of vulnerability with strangeness. Tim and Dawn hide away thier desperate longing and love for each other in a way that is subtle in action but heavy in effect. It's really a great and funny show - one the very few top quality 30 minute comedy shows on TV in the last 10 years or more.

Why in the world should anyone care for these mere worker bees?  None of them are the least bit interesting.  They whine and squeak through the day with nary a sense of concern for the valiant corporation gracious enough to employ them.
The characters, not unlike my actual minions, are beneath my contempt.  I hated every vacuous, empty-headed and insipid moment of this series.  Perhaps the only character worthy of mention is that of Gareth.  He is the right hand man every superpower in business (not unlike myself) needs in order to accomplish his goals.
Two stars for Gareth and the smug pomposity that is sure to confound any resident of the Northern American States.  They, as a viewing public, need their hands held and senses of humour coddled, not unlike their foreign policies.",1066867200,13,1040,4.782122905027933
1900030,5,B00009ZY9E,"I first saw ""The Office"" while channel surfing. I didn't know what it was,exactly,as it had a documentary feel. But when David the sleazy boss opened his mouth,I knew that I was watching the greatest thing since Mystery Science Theater 3000. The acting is superb,especially by the actor who portrays David,the mealy-mouthed sleazoid,lying,humorless(although he thinks he is a comic genius),twit boss of the office. This man is I think,the best actor I have ever watched,film and television included. He really is. And he does it so effortlessly. He also co-writes the show and has no qualms about making his character out to be an embarrassment to humankind. It's wonderful. All of the actors are ""spot on,"" as the British say,and the acting and lines are so good,you may find yourself cringing in embarrassment..really..it's painful to watch,but in a pleasing masochistic way,if you get my drift.
If you like superb ensemble acting,and some of the best laugh/cringe -inducing dialog ever written for tv,or any media,you must check this out. You will not be disappointed.",1066780800,5,1071,5.196531791907514
1900031,5,B00009ZY9E,"There is little doubt that THE OFFICE is the best comedy airing on television today. It is hilarious, smart, and innovative to say the least. The premise of the show is excellent: a faux documentary of employees of a paper merchant company near London. The camera follows the workers in their daily interactions with each other and with their dodgy office manager, David Brent. Anyone who has worked in an office environment can easily relate to the drudgery depicted in this show. The employees have to endure David Brent with his canned management lingo along with the antics of Gareth, 'the team leader' and David's pet. David is arguably the best depiction of an incompetent supervisor to date. While striving to bring humor into the workplace and be everyone's pal he ends up insulting many and comes off as a genuine jerk. The plots are simple yet brilliant. There is little action involved but the acting and writing behind this show always succeed in filling an entire episode with sidesplitting funny scenarios. My personal favorite episodes include the one with the doomed training session and also the one with the mocked up pornographic picture of David that was circulated around the office and Gareth's attempt of finding the perpetrator. (Just thinking about these episodes makes me laugh...)
Many people claim that the cult classic OFFICE SPACE is the best show depicting the absurdity of cubicle work, but I believe that OFFICE SPACE does not even touch the talent and genius of THE OFFICE. Watching all six episodes of the first season will guarantee a good laugh. No fear, I have seen the first two episodes of the second season on BBC America and I can testify that the creativity of this show has not diminished one bit.
As stated in a promotional commercial on BBC America, THE OFFICE is one of the saddest and yet the funniest shows on television.",1066694400,6,1870,4.846875
1900032,5,B00009ZY9E,"Absolute class, David Brent is both funny to watch and an absolute w*nker aswell. The best comedies are British like Only Fools and Horses, The Royle Family and the Office is right up there with them. I just wish we could get The Royle Family here in America.
Ricky Gervais.....absolute genious!",1066608000,,295,4.803921568627451
1900033,5,B00009ZY9E,"While the television pool is currently littered with reality shows, ""The Office"" offers a breath of fresh air.  It is a mockumentary, a comedy specifically designed to LOOK like a bird's eye view of the everyday activities of a British paper merchant.  The irony is that these actors have more depth and personality than any ""character"" from shows like The Real World and Big Brother.
The cast is led by Ricky Gervais (who also co-writes) as regional manager David Brent, an ultimately sleazy boss who spends more time trying to be witty than he does managing his staff.  His battles with political correctness are hilarious, as he is very aware that a camera is following him.  His right hand man is Gareth (Mackenzie Crook), a former army lieutenant who believes he has more company power than his assistant regional manager (I mean, assistant TO the regional manager) position truly entitles.  Gareth spends most of his day pestering Tim (Martin Freeman), an obviously bored sales associate who always has a witty comment to add to any conversation.  Dawn (Lucy Davis), a receptionist engaged to marry a warehouse worker, is the object of Tim's affection and the victim of one of Mr. Brent's cruelest practical jokes in the pilot.
Each cast member is some sort of caricature of a person you might see in your own workplace.  The situations they come across could happen to anyone (lay-offs, sexual harassment, jokes via company e-mail, romances, et cetera).  This show is kind of like ""Spinal Tap"": it fools you for a second to believe that this office could exist.  And there's no whining, no drama for the camera's sake, no huge mansions for seven people to argue in.  It's just these people, going about their days, doing their jobs.  And it couldn't be more brilliant or side-splittingly funny.
This DVD features every episode from the first series, which is great if you only get to sporadically catch episodes or moments on BBC America.  There are also funny deleted scenes, with explanations from the writers as to why they were cut, and a 30-minute featurette.
If you have not yet discover this delightful British import, I strongly recommend you check it out.  If you loved the movie ""Office Space"" (or at least sort of identified with it), you will laugh at loud at ""The Office.""  Enjoy it now before some American television writers enlist their own sub-par remake.",1066348800,4,2379,4.870967741935484
1900034,5,B00009ZY9E,"David Brent just wants to be loved and thinks the best way to achieve this is to be as obnoxious and embarassing as possible.  Tim loves Dawn but Dawn is stuck in a long engagement to boorish Lee.  Gareth thinks he's tough because he's a weekend warrior (territorial army).  Add 15 other people and stick them in a paper merchant's office.  Hilarious!  The highlight of this series is episode four where David Brent hijacks a training session with his excruciating songs (listen out for ""free love on the free love highway"" - classic).  I like the mundane shots in this pseudo documentary - particularly watching the photocopier spew out more paper.",1066089600,,649,4.801801801801802
1900035,5,B00009ZY9E,"If it wasn't for ""The Office"",most people would still think that BBC America only had home and garden shows,EastEnders and Graham Norton on all day. If you've seen the first season's episodes,you already know how great this show is. If not,do yourself a favor and catch up,then buy the DVD and watch it again. Ricky Gervais is so brilliant as the creepily funny David Brent,you WILL actually feel more than a bit uncomfortable and embarrassed for him when he 1)tries too hard to be funny or 2)when he's so clearly unaware of the hole that he's digging that it becomes surreal. And that's the beauty of this show:Take a total idiot meanie of a boss and combine it with the mundane day to day goings-on of working in Corporate(office politics seem to be identical on both sides on the Atlantic) and you immediately recognize the similarities to real life. While David Brent is the linchpin of the show,the characters of Tim,Dawn and Gareth are also essential. A classic play on the office crush subplot(Salesman Tim pines for the lovely but unobtainable receptionist Dawn)grows at a mild but always interesting pace that it reaches a brilliant fever pitch by the second season. And you'd feel bad for Brent's suck-up subordinate Gareth if the practical jokes played on him by Tim weren't so damn funny. Another plus for this series:no laugh track/studio audience to spell out to you what jokes are funny,no gimmicks or situations for the characters to work out(ala ""Friends"")and no political correctness. It really is reminscent of ""Fawlty Towers""or ""Curb your Enthusiam""so if you're a fan of either of those,you shouldn't find any problem with ""The Office"". Again,I say:get the DVD,watch the reruns on BBCAmerica and savor the genius before the Hollywood fat cats make good on their promise and ruin it i.e.making an American version.",1065744000,30,1833,4.973941368078176
1900036,5,B00009ZY9E,"I'm a Brit who has enjoyed the office over the past couple of years here in Britain. Needless to say, it is brilliant. David Brent is the boss of this small paper publishing company who are currently being filmed for a documentary to be put on tv (this is just an excuse to allow us to see the world of this office). Needless to say, David thinks he is great and always plays the good guy moralist for the cameras, the rest of his staff think him an idiot though, you soon see why! Great comedy involving embarrassment, peoples relationships and Davids own logical traps as he explain his personal theories of life to the camera crew! There is no laughter track, or jokes per se, but the whole situation renders the program as funny and tragic.
Anyway, i just wanted to say that series 2 is even better (David has to put up with the boss of the other branch and his staff. The new boss called Neil is genuinely nice, funny and fair. The staff are all very normal and hard-working. Cue David trying to get them to loosen up! 'You will never ever get a boss like me again' he pleads). So buy this when it gets release in the UK which is mid-October, check amazon.co.uk for more info.
If you like this then you must buy 'Im Alan Partridge' and 'Phoenix Nights'. Both are loved over here (Alan Partridge is a video diary of a failed TV celebrity forced to do 4-7am Radio shows! He quickly loses the plot. Phoenix Nights is about a pub run by a power crazy madcap businessman, see amazon.co.uk for more!)  We recently went through a comedy golden age in the UK when these thress comedies aired in the same weeks!",1064966400,17,1607,4.3566666666666665
1900037,5,B00009ZY9E,"I've been watching/recording episodes of The Office over here in the states since the re-runs have been playing on the BBC.
It is absolutely hilarious.  David Brent is a ""wanker"".  He thinks he's the coolest, and his jokes are horrible, even though he thinks they're great.
He's a horrible boss, and thinks he knows how to run an effective business.  All of the employees hate him, but act like they like him only when he's around and they just make fun of him all of the time.
So don't pass this DVD up, I've been waiting for it to be released for the US and now it's here, so it's definately a must have.",1063929600,2,606,4.298245614035087
1900038,5,B00009ZY9E,"At first sight, this show is SO sick and disturbing that it can really repulse.  Ricky Gervais (writer, lead, creator) stabs into the heart of the common man's working environment with a 'mock-u-mentary' (faux documentary using comedy; this is 'Spinal Tap' for the office worker) about the office of a British paper distrubution franchise.  Caught in tedium, these no-where people generally are caught trying project larger images of themselves, openly admit they are boring, or try to rip down others putting up facades.  The 6 episodes cover great, unfathomed material the jaded and decadent Hollywood crowd could scarcely relate to.  It begins with the District Manager alerting David Brent (Gervais) that cutbacks are rolling down the line to his office, and allows this sword of Damocles to hang over the staff until the resolve in the final episode. Inbetween we get to see Brent and his excellently written/acted staff play out truely horrid moments with employee's night out at a club, training day (the best episode by far), hiring a secretary, and a staffer's pathetic 30th birthday party.  Once I got over the shocking, candid humor framing the hideous fronts and foibles of the characters, it became an enjoyable bathe in the muck of human politics.  This is brilliant TV.  Goes right to the heart of human woe.",1063497600,8,1323,5.041284403669724

Please check this original out BEFORE the Americanized version (which is in the  works) hits our shores. Ricky Gervais has created a classic character in David Brent, the office manager from hell.  Gervais took a page from John Cleese's book and called it quits after two series (the Brit equivalent of American television seasons) so that the quality of the work would not deteriorate: What we are left with is a diamond of a series.",1063238400,18,657,4.839285714285714

I'm a big fan of the Office Space movie, but this takes the office experience to a whole new level.
Basically, this is a show of office workers doing boring, tedious work. The boss, David, thinks everyone is SO happy, because he's such a hoopy guy. In fact, the entire office is obviously miserable BECAUSE the boss is so out of touch.

1900042,5,B00009ZY9E,"I have been watching BBCAmerica for over three years. I've seen alot of great shows over a course of three years (ex: Father Ted, Coupling, Red Dwarf)and I've never seen a show as smart and clever since ""The Larry Sanders Show"". The characters actually make your stomach turn. I showed this show to my family, and they couldn't watch. Everybody said the boss reminded them of a boss they once had.  My grandmother said ""Gareth (He looks like a deformed David Spade)is an ugly bastard"". She left the room because she couldn't stand him. I always say if a show can make you feel something it's great. This show's a  modern classic. The best shows are Seinfeld, Curb Your Enthusiasm, The Larry Sanders Show, and now I'm proud to say ""The Office"". Buy the DVD! You won't regret it. It's better [than""Friends""] (Any television show is better than that show). British shows are much better than American shows. There smarter and edgier. The Office doesn't have a laugh track so that might make simple minded people upset. Some shows with laugh tracks force you to laugh (Friends). This show doesn't. This is like if you really stepped into an Office and saw all these strange and interesting people. I love the show because it reminds me of the sleazebag teachers at my school. This show is great because a regular working class person can relate with these characters. Shows like Coupling, (Which is a great show so I advise everybody to watch it. It's lightyears ahead of that show Friends) you can't relate with the characters. There all very good looking people with minor idiosyncrasies that get blown way out of proportion. That's not real life. Real life is harsh and mean. People working at a dead end job will love this devine comedy that's not really about an office, but life in general. The office really is a state of mind where you feel stupid and lonely (Tim) while stupid people rule everthing (Daivd Brent). I give this show which, I call the one of the greatest comedy's of all time a five out of five! Watch it you won't regret it.",1063065600,15,2044,4.628099173553719

Support comes from his spindly sidekick Gareth Keenan who says he's in the Territorial Army.

1900045,5,B00009ZY9E,"For anyone who enjoys sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek humour, for anyone who daily works in an office, experiencing both the best and worst of human behaviour, Ricky Gervais's 'The Office' is bound to appeal.
This series introduces us to a faux-reality genre, and once grasped , the viewer can sit back and get to know David Brent , the office manager who will make your skin crawl, your teeth itch and your own office manager seem like a dream. Gervais has created a character so utterly despisable and annoying that you feel compelled to watch him out of morbid facination.
Brent is joined in the office by pendantic, paranoid and pathetic Gareth ( played brilliantly by Mackenzie Cook). Afflicted with the notion of being an ex-highly trained combat soldier , Gareth is a wealth of useless information and is desperate to assert himself as assistant to the manager. For me, this character completely steals the show and his witty , 'deep' asides to the camera , facial expressions and ridiculous hair-style leave you almost WANTING him to apply for the next vacancy in your OWN workplace.
Gareth's office buddy is the likeable, Tim ( Martin Freeman), who appears to be the only 'normal' character. Tim & Gareth's quick, sharp banter displays some of the best comedy writing I have seen for a long time. The long-suffering and good natured Tim endures the office environment only by pursuing his crush on receptionist Dawn ( Lucy Davis ) who is constantly beseiged by the inappropriate behaviour of David Brent.
'The Office' is so cleverly written , perfectly cast and well acted , that at first it really seems to be reality TV. It pokes fun at the boundries and 'rules' set in modern offices. You'll no doubt recognise more than a few of your colleages amongst the characters!
I so enjoyed watching this series on a hired video , that I went out and bought it for myself on DVD. Each time I watch the episodes, I find myself noticing more humour hidden in fast one-liners and clever acting. I'm already looking forward to the second series being released. Ricky Gervais should be commended for writing and producing such a refreshing ,clever and addictive show , that leaves you grinning to yourself for weeks after viewing.",1060732800,3,2223,4.821989528795812

They have brought us such gems as The Royle Family, Father Ted, Coupling, and countless others, but The Office hits home. Anyone who has enjoyed the great film Office Space will love this program mainly because you know these people, they are the same people in your office with the same problems and attitudes. The only sad part is that since it is a hit, some American network will try to re-tool it (dumb it down) to fit what they think Americans will watch. Look at what they did to Coupling!

The trick is that at first you believe it is a reality TV-show (handheld cameras, speaking directly to camera, etc) which works wonderfully well. Once you have got used to this, the laughter comes thick and fast. However, its ability to make you absolutely squirm with embarrassment (even more than Fawlty Towers)is also a major highlight.
