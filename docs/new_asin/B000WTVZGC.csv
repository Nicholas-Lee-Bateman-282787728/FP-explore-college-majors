2991582,3,B000WTVZGC,"Looking around all I see are negative reviews for Lake Placid 2 and I have to wonder what was everyone expecting? While the original did get over with the audience it's not seen as a classic of the genre, but as an enjoyable movie. Did anyone really expect Lake Placid 2 to be some kind of classic? The budget is obviously very low and Sci-Fi Pictures was involved right there you should know what to expect.

I see so many reviews calling this the worst movie ever; come on people lighten up. Is Lake Placid 2 a bad movie? Hell yeah, but it's also a lot of fun. The cast and crew knew the kind of movie they were making and make a B-movie that isn't meant to be taken seriously. All the comedy and idiotic moments are intentional.

Anybody who has read my reviews knows I'm not the biggest fan of CGI; I don't like and I probably never will. But the CGI in Lake Placid 2 is the best. And by best I mean worst. It's always easy to spot the CGI. Unless used very little you can always spot it and that sort of takes me out of the movie, but here the CGI is so fake looking it just makes the movie more fun. The Crocodiles are CGI and they look like something from Playstation. And the CGI gore also looks like something you would see playing Playstation.

Remember those old super low budget movies where they would put a guy a monsters suit and have him run around chasing people? Well Lake Placid 2 is sort of like that only with the CGI. Every time one of the Crocodiles appears on screen it's damn hysterical. Normally I hate CGI, but in this case I loved it since it really makes the movie even funnier.

The screenplay was written by Todd Hurvitz & Howie Miller and yeah it was a silly screenplay filled with characters saying and doing the dumbest of things. But that was the point; these guys weren't trying to write a Crocodile version of Jaws. They were writing a silly B-movie.

Director David Flores keeps the movie moving at a silly pace and never attempts at making a serious movie. He knew what kind of movie this was and makes that movie. There is always something silly happening to keep things silly and fun.

The actors were mostly good, yes you read that right. The main cast all put in the performances they were meant to. They put in a silly and even slightly over the top performances. The actors weren't meant to play it straight at all and they knew this and don't attempt to. John Schneider as Sheriff Riley was a blast. It was quite clear he was enjoying himself and puts in the performance he was meant to. And does this guy not age? He can easily pass for his 30s. Sarah Lafleur as Emily also puts in a fun and campy performance as the love interest for the Sheriff.

Chad Collins as Scott Riley and Alicia Ziegler as Kerri play it a little more-straight and actually both gave fairly good performances. Let's face it they didn't have the best of material, but both do rather well and I would like to see them in a more serious movie to see what they have acting wise. Cloris Leachman and Sam McMurray round out the cast; both actors have been around for quite a while and McMurray is one of those guys you know by face, but not name and he also seems to be having a lot of fun in his role as Struthers.

Bottom line is this by no means is Lake Placid 2 a good movie. It's a bad movie sure, but it's also fun in how idiotic it was. The CGI was horrible and adds to silliness of the movie. Fans of low brow so bad its good cinema might find some entertainment out of this. Don't except a good a movie or a scary movie. It's a silly movie that works on how bad it is. Lake Placid 2 is the type of movie you watch and make fun of. Don't take it so seriously.",1202169600,31,3683,4.184767277856135
2991583,1,B000WTVZGC,"Normally I enjoy B movies....and I loved the first Lake Placid.  Aside from a few humorous moments, this was absolutely horrible.  Thankfully I rented it first.",1201824000,,160,5.115384615384615
2991584,1,B000WTVZGC,I bought this movie and was checking it out on amazon before I watched it and am I ever glad I did before I opened it up for $19.00. After reading the reviews I don't even want to watch it for $9.00. Maybe after it gets down to $0.99 I will be willing. Thanks to everyone for writting about it so I could sped my money on a good film. THANK YOU,1201737600,3,344,3.7916666666666665
2991585,1,B000WTVZGC,"Wow, this was a big disappointment. I happen to really like the first one, and this is nothing like it. Horrible CGI. I loath to even refer to it as acting. No suspense, no cheap scares, no halfway decent one liners. They don't even have consistency. First they decide it's to fast to outrun, then they decide hey, lets make a run for it! You've been warned, so if you waste your money on this gem, it's your own fault.",1201478400,8,419,4.25
2991586,4,B000WTVZGC,"Due to a state of recent disappearances, Deputy James Riley, (John Schneider) is confronted with evidence of something monstrous in the lake, forcing his ex-wife Emma Warner, (Sarah Lafleur) a Wildlife agent, to show up as well. Deciding to search around the lake, they find a giant crocodile that attacks their boat. When professional hunter Struthers, (Sam McMurray) shows up due to the rumors and sets up camp to hunt the crocodile, he stocks up for a war with the beast. While they're fighting, James' son Scott Riley, (Justin Ulrich) and his friend Kerri, (Alicia Ziegler) along with some of their friends soon find that not only are they also attacked by the crocodile, there's a small family of them living in the lake and who all decide to gang up on the two groups of survivors stranded on the lake. Finally realizing what they're up against, they decide to work together to stop their rampage before more fall victim to them.

The Good News: This was actually a pretty good creature feature. One of the best things is that it plays up the previous knowledge and manages to expand upon it. The end of the previous one set-up the fact that babies had been born, and this one here is where the children come back and strike out against intruders as adults. The constant mention of characters and situations being brought up simply tie the events together, and a rather decent attempt is made to make the constant interaction in the forest look similar, ensuring another small bit of continuity. That includes the next great feature, the different crocodiles. This is one of the few films that has several individuals of the threat for the characters to get around. Having four crocs to deal with is a pretty clever move, allowing it to drop the tiresome ""invincible creature"" motif and actually make some semblance of reality when they can kill off one of the creatures early on without making it seem like the characters are out of danger or the crocs are weak. That itself is a really great idea no matter what the angle played. Another really smart move is to make the existence of the creatures known fairly early in the film, as it does here, allowing for a lot of croc screen-time and playing in to the option of letting one of the other ones take over if one is killed option that it uses since there's more than one. With it being fairly obvious to the characters about twenty minutes or so into the film that there's something huge and vicious in the lake, and for this to be obvious to them is quite nice, as the search for them leads to some really great scenes. The search for the first croc on the lake is a nice action highlight, as the different tactics used to try to slow it down make some nice little action scenes in it. There's even a little back-and-forth as the croc puts up a valiant struggle and manages to take out several vehicles of the police force before being brought down when it seemed like it would've been the police force which had the upper hand. The assault on the campground is one of the highlights, as there's a lot of action with the first couple traps and the ensuing attack is nicely handled. It gets to it's parts, though, when it goes for the jungle attacks, as the assaults on the stranded campers comprise so many great scenes and moments that there's a lot to like in them. Handled with great skill and even allowing some creepy moments to come into play, these are simply great and really make the movie, along with the first lake capture, and make this a really worthy sequel.

The Bad News: There isn't a lot here that isn't to like. One of the only points is that, as usual, the crocodiles and the gore are completely CGI and don't look even the slightest bit real. It's not that they look off or unrealistic, as they look remarkably close to what they're supposed to be. It's simply the fact that the tone and appearance of the creatures are quite obviously not there. It's a bit distracting to see that the main threat of the film isn't there, and as it's so easily apparent of this, there's very little confusion about whether or not the effects are CGI or not. It's actually impossible to feel any threat of the crocs due to this state, which is just a common problem that so many similar films have. That the gore, which should've been a big highlight isn't that shocking or revolting because of the CGI aspects is another flaw, and just look fake, especially since the crocs have so much screen-time to get to see all the fake-ness of their design. Beyond these, this is an enjoyable film, but they will make it hard for some to get into the film.

The Final Verdict: While not up to the level of the first one, it's still a reasonably entertaining creature feature. The worse that can be said about it is that it's computer graphics are quite obviously fake, yet real creature feature fans won't mind this one bit and have some fun with it, so this is really only recommended to those kinds of viewers. All others shouldn't.",1199577600,4,4990,4.523809523809524
2991587,1,B000WTVZGC,"all i will say about this film is that after watching it, i felt like stabbing my eyes out with a blunt object and setting myself on fire as punishment for even watching it. the movie has no direction as apose 2 the first film. they treated the first film like an urban legend. i mean cmon, giant crocodiles eating up people in a small community, why would u want 2 cover that up? the visual effects were pointless, the acting was not convincing, and the outcome was like u expect, dull and useless. i highly recommend you stay away from this film. and if u do decide 2 watch it anyway, may god have mercy on u",1194912000,4,610,4.177966101694915
2991588,5,B000WTVZGC,"The film is not as good as the original but then again, this was made on 1/100 of the budget of the first one.
The film is fun, fast, and has a couple good scares.  Cloris Leachman and Sam MacMurray steal the show.

2991589,1,B000WTVZGC,"What can I say besides... WOW Hollywood has really become overloaded with popculture, sellouts, and cr@ppy cg effects.  The first Lake Placid was great, decent effects, decent one liners, good cast, and reminded me of the classic Alligator.  In Lake Pacid 2, I have seen children preform an elementry play better then this.  Has Cloris Leachman really reduced herself down to this type of trash?  I love Cloris, but she should stick to comedy.  The effects, dear god, I have seen better animation on a super nintendo game. Furthermore, was the nudity called for.  The first Lake Placid showed no [...] and it was great, in this film the writer/director knew this movie would suck, therefore he threw in random [...] just to draw in teenage hormones.  Stay away at all cost, if you are bored enough to watch this go to movie fourmz and watch it for free.  You will be greatful you did not blow your money on a low budget cruddy sequal, which never should have been made in the first place.",1194393600,9,988,4.605714285714286

2991692,2,B000WTVZGC,"A sequel to Lake Placid (1999), the Sy Fy Channel Original Movie Lake Placid 2 (2007), continues the story of oversized crocodiles loose in Black Lake, Maine.  Without a particularly interesting story, the main attraction is probably the carnivorous beasts, but sadly the special effects in this made for TV movie, are barely adequate at best.  The crocs chomp people whole, and boldly crawl up on land to attack, but it's all rather unconvincing, often more funny than scary.

Sadie Bickerman (Cloris Leachman) has been feeding her pets meat loaded with growth hormones, causing the crocs to grow to enormous size.  When a scientist is attacked and killed on the lake, Sheriff James Riley (John Schneider) begins an investigation.  Also involved is Emma Warner (Sarah Lafleur), a Fish and Wildlife officer who is Riley's ex-girlfriend.  It's not long before the crocodiles strike again, destroying the Sheriff's boat, and forcing the party to swim for their lives.  Adding some color to the proceedings is the presence of Struthers (Sam McMurray), a hunter with questionable ethics, and his assistant Ahmad (Joe Holt).  Struthers has plans to bag a croc, but he seems to be better at shooting off his mouth, than his hunting rifle.  Also in the woods is Riley's son Scott (Chad Collins), and a group of teenagers who have their partying interrupted by the hungry crocs.

Lake Placid 2's weak script, bad dialog, and uninspiring special effects, makes it hard for anyone to look good, and John Schneider's laid back approach often giving the impression that he is barely awake.  Like many films of this type, the actors often appear silly interacting with CGI creatures, as people get chomped up, limbs are severed, and bullets have no effect.  Familiar ground for those acquainted with Sy Fy productions, but even graded on a curve, this one is average at best, with the kills and sharp tongued Sadie Bickerman the main source of entertainment value.  Sy Fy followed this with yet another sequel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lake-Placid-3-Unrated/dp/B003ZZ7TPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lake Placid 3 (Unrated)</a>&nbsp;(2010) that takes the series to a new low.  If you are really interested, you can often find these films listed on Sy Fy's schedule on their ""creature feature"" days.",1296345600,,2334,5.341530054644808
2991693,5,B000WTVZGC,"I once decried all those quickie SyFy (nee Sci-Fi) movies.  The overnight-written scripts, the over-the-weekend CGI effects, the second/third/fourth tier actors.  Not sophisticated enough for erudite and discerning me.  However, I found myself always tuning in to ""the most dangerous night on television"" to see the next big threat bested by a small gutsy band (hero, heroine, and several extras to be eaten/destroyed/immolated, etc).  Why?  As one of those Vietnam era vets, I cherished my weekends at the local drive-in in the 60's and 70's where, oddly enough, the same type of movies played.  Back then it was men in rubber monster suits demolishing miniature sets, or men in rubber alien costumes carrying away beautiful kicking blonds, or men in rubber . . . well, you get the point.  So, does a movie like ""Lake Placid 2"" remind me of my youth, or does it give me one more Saturday night to throw popcorn and laugh at the screen?  Doesn't matter.  I love this movie for the little pleasure it gives.  Like hearing your favorite Christmas carol once a year.  You roll your eyes and think ""not that old song again,"" and when no one is looking you smile and sing along.",1260144000,12,1173,4.757425742574258
2991694,4,B000WTVZGC,"Within the creatures-on-the-loose genre exists the sub-category of crocogator flicks. Believe it or not, 2007's ""Lake Placid 2"" is one of the better entries in this genre. In my opinion it's more entertaining than the original 1999 film, which is hard to believe since this sequel went straight-to-DVD with a much lower budget (a mere $2 million compared to $27 million). Other than the budget and the cast ""Lake Placid 2"" is superior in practically every way:

- Although both films have a were-not-taking-this-too-seriously vibe, similar to ""Crocodile"" (2000) and ""Alligator"" (1980), ""Lake Placid 2"" is a little more serious than the original, which scores points in my book (but, don't get me wrong, there are quite a few funny and campy parts, like the incredibly casual way the Ranger responds toward people who have just perished).

- The babes are both more numerous and hotter. One good example is Sarah Lafleur (Emma) and her dive into the water early in the picture. Then you have Rachel and her white bikini (VJ Kewl, aka VJ Benson), stunning blond Edi (Zhasmina Toskova) and, lastly, the secondary protagonist, Kerri (Alicia Ziegler).

- The Bulgarian locations are superior to British Columbia. Not that B.C. isn't gorgeous but the story takes place in New England and Bulgaria is simply a better stand-in for Maine. (If you're not sure where Bulgaria is, it's located in Southeastern Europe by the Black Sea).

- Although the cgi crocs may not look as good as the first film, the kills are better, if you're into that sort of thing.

- The story, which is very similar to the original, is all-around better for what it is (a Grade-B nature-runs-amok flick).

Although the cast may not be as A-list as the first film, they came up with a good group of people led by John Schneider and all have fine chemistry together; they obviously had a fun time making this picture. John is a excellent leading man and perfect for these types of films. Some, of course, mock him because he played Bo Duke on The Dukes of Hazzard, but so what? How does that detract from his performance in this film or others of the same ilk, like ""Ogre""? He's an actor/entertainer and perfectly capable of playing different roles. Incidentally, he was in his late forties during filming and still looks great -- does the man ever age?!

Other highlights include Sarah Lafleur's face and hair; she's so uniquely cute it's somehow enjoyable to just look at her. Also, there are some really laugh-out-loud moments, like the ranger's comment near the end regarding the recurring white bunny, as well as a certain quasi-villain (Sam McMurray) whom I was just starting to really like, and then... well, I can't give it away. Other cast members not mentioned yet include Chad Michael Collins as Scott, Joe Holt as Ahmad and Cloris Leachman as Sadie, the old woman who regards the crocs as her ""kids.""

There's not much else to say. If you're in the mood for a crocogator flick you can't go wrong with ""Lake Placid 2"". Yes, it's a low budget, direct-to-DVD release but it's quite entertaining for what it is and compares well with the other films of the genre. Don't give heed to the grumps who rate it so lowly; they're wrong. It's almost on par with ""Crocodile"" and ""Alligator"" and in many ways better than the original ""Lake Placid.""

The movie runs 88 minutes.

  If you liked the original movie as I did you'll enjoy this movie. It has the same dark comedy lines. There is nothing wrong with the CGA crocodiles.
  You'll miss the suspence of the original movie as we already know it's the crocs. This movie the crocs get well fed.

The CGI is not believable, the attacks rather pedestrian, and the acting terrible.  Normally I like John Schneider a lot, but the writing and direction was so bad that he didn't have a chance to salvage this flick.

A lot of the acting - especially in the beginning - was more like the voice overs for some foreign films I've seen than actual acting. I actually liked Cloris Leachman the best out of all of the actors (she was indeed scarier than the crocodile). I love campy movies but I just didn't see it in this movie.

The reason I am giving it three stars is for the last special feature - the ""Gnawed Up Version"" of the movie, which I didn't see anyone else mentioning. It is FABULOUS!! It fast forwards through all of the ""boring"" parts of the film and stops to regular speed on the boobs, croc, and carnage.

2991702,2,B000WTVZGC,"""Lake Placid 2"" is a more boring version of the original featuring former ""Dukes of Hazzard"" star John Schneider, a gigantic CGI crocodile, and Cloris Leachman as the local crazy lady (replacing Betty White from the original). This made in Bulgaria flick tries to re-create the frights and good humor of the original, but largely falls short.

Most of the acting is wooden, with Schneider turning in the best of the performances, although the beautiful Sarah Lafleur does her best as the Fish and Game Administration agent and love interest. The highlight is seeing Leachman acting insane and following in White's footsteps in encouraging the flourishing fauna in Lake Placid.

The crocodile is onscreen quite a bit and the CGI varies from acceptable to really bad. The crocodile serves as a substitute for plot; the story ambles on very predictably (especially if you saw the original), with occasional stabs at humor and titillation interspersed throughout.

On balance, ""Lake Placid 2"" is an unneeded sequel, and while there are certainly many better creatures-gone-wild movies, Leachman and numerous ridiculous situations make this watchable once through for fans of brainless camp films.",1226620800,,1192,5.296296296296297

  This is the best crocofilm of the subcrocoflicks - the second drawer of crockery.
  CGI, while not top-notch like the original, sometimes comes close, and to me is never really bad but just off a few times (Playstation can be pretty real sometimes you know!). So, CGIOK.

LP2 is
1) Finally a croc film where you do see a fair amount of the croc.
2) And - I can't believe it - it is always in the day! Though the real solidity is slightly lacking, and only once the beast enters sunlight - and it's when it's dappled; that sucks. Sometimes the detail gets quite good, showing even the inside of the mouth.

  Sure the pointier, snappier wit of the orig is not quite there, but at least it has wit, with bite! They do try much humour and I don't think it all as sad as most others do. Most so-called creature films don't have any humour, for fear of disturbing the seriousness, but are like food without spice or sauce, that goes down like unreality, or like having a meal without a drink. So hooray here!
 Plus it has some delicious desserts in carnage. Gratuitous beasts and gratuitous breasts!
 As always, the actors and plot are on par with the CGI.

THE OTHER BOTTOM DRAWER CROCKERY
Don't see Supercroc of **it (on the DVD extra, even the girl star said welcome to ""Super croc of..."" then she went quiet and laughed I think), where the nightly ghost croc is more lacking in detail.
Make sure you miss bloody Blood Surf, that croc out where you never even see the whole croc once - see it walking - but just the rubber head or front part. THAT is much worse than the meticulous care that goes into even undernourished CGI.
You can wait to see Primeval, the better of these two, with infuriating minimal croc action, always at night, and always spaztcroc.
And cop Croc. Unless it is the first or second croc film you've seen, is just the same routine filmed in minimalism again. Mostly real crocs are filmed, often with added CGI like an arm out the mouth, or else shoddy flashes of the crocodummy head.
Black Water I've yet to see seems above C-grade.

2991706,1,B000WTVZGC,"Avoid seeing this god awful excuse for a sequel to a movie that did not need a sequel done in the first place.

Bo Duke now resides in a small town, and this guy who was out on a boat with his friend are attacked by a crocodile. When he reports it, Bo Duke does not beleive him and the sheriffs department think it is a joke.

However, even after Bo is shown evidence of what is left of the first victim of one of the crocs, he continues to smile, joke around like he could not care about anything less in the world.

Along the way you meet characters who can not act for SHIpenuTs, but got the part cause they where willing to take there cloths off at the drop of a hat.

Each character in the movie seems to be done in a lame way. You can not beleive any of the characters, the acting itself is dreadful on most actors part, and the plot is almost the same as the original movie.

This time around, Cloris Leachmen plays the sister of Rose from the golden girls. And it's just too corny, and too predictable what her story is. But the thing about her character, is she was one of the actors in the movie who wasn't doing a terrible job, but the character she was given was like monkeys wrote the part.

If the acting and some of the accents and the characters where not bad enough, then there is the CGI. For a movie made in 2007, you do not expect to see CGI work that looks like it was from 1997. The croc's looked unbelievably bad, and the way they move are just in no way at all believable.

Anyone who has seen a real croc or alligator know they are not slow moving creatures, they pounce out of the water at speeds you have to see to beleive. And they can use there tails to launch many feet into the air. Yet the characters in this movie have no trouble out swimming a croc, hiding in a tree about 5 foot in the air, and have plenty of time to see a croc coming for them and decide what they will have for lunch next Tuesday before opening fire at one of these things.

I know sometimes you can suspend belief and just go with being entertained by a movie, but this one just does so many things that stand out in a bad way that you can't sit back and just enjoy it.

The script writer seemed to have had a decent story going, but the way it was filmed... it's like the director never did the scenes over and over to get the best one, he was like, ""do it once....that will do, next""

The plots and ideas behind it where just lame, bad or leaving you thinking, ""what where they thinking?"" and thats what I say to this movie overall.

There is one more thing I did not like about this movie. The way it was shot, directed, cut together and even the way it was acted... if they cut out the un-needed nudity, this movie would be rated PG.

Which audience did they plan to show this to? Cause the adult audience are definitely saying how bad and lame it is. And at many points in the movie, I thought I was watching a kids movie.

If you have a program like NERO, use one of it's features to cut out the nudity scenes, then show it to a kid under 13. Then ask them if they thought any of the movie was the slightest bit scary?

This movie has no idea which way it should go, family movie, or more mature audience, and by the final cut of this thing, it's the useless nudity thats the only thing that gets it a rating above PG13.",1213833600,,3331,4.050228310502283

2991711,1,B000WTVZGC,"When Lake Placid came out in 1999 it was a bit of a surprise hit and better than it had a right to be, partly because it was a campy ode to monster movies of the 1950's. Still, it was not a film that I thought would have been worthy of generating a sequel, particularly so many years later. Lake Placid 2 originally premiered on the Sci-Fi Channel several months ago but has now been released on DVD in an unrated version. More on that in a moment.

Once again were back at the quaint Maine setting and the serene lake where the first film took place. John Schneider is Sheriff Riley, living with his teenaged son Scott (Chad Collins). I have to say that Schneider looks very good. With his hair longer, he looks almost as young as he did in his Dukes of Hazzard days, and much younger than he did in Smallville. Unfortunately Schneider seems to know he's in a bit of a clunker here and doesn't generate a lot of electricity for a guy in the lead role.

The plot in Lake Placid is pretty identical to the first film with just new characters: Small town sheriff, cute co-star Emily(Lefleur) who is an agent of the Fish & Wildlife department, and another crazy old hag. This time its scary looking Cloris Leachman playing Sadie Bickerman, the sister of Betty White's character from the original film. With two Mary Tyler Moore show alums used so far, who's on tap for Lake Placid 3, Valerie Harper?

Anyway, after the first crocodile attack, Riley mobilizes his, um, deputy to begin a search of the lake along with Emily who is apparently an old flame but that's never complexly explained. Their search is interrupted by the appearance of a big game hunter named Struthers and his assistant Ahmad who've come to kill the beast. Meanwhile, Scott and his friends have picked that day to go swimming in the lake and I'm sure you can guess what happens to most of them.

So what makes the DVD unrated? A little swearing and some topless girls. Granted, the girls are damn hot but they are killed very quickly. Honestly there's about 90 seconds of material...maybe...which make the movie ""unrated"" over what was shown on TV. The CGI is typical of a Sci-Fi channel film...in other words...bad. I've seen documentaries on the Discovery Channel, which had better CGI effects than this film. There's just no believing that the croc is interacting with the actors at any time. Making matters worse is the actors themselves to a weak job in making the scenes believable. There are several occasions where the actors are within arm's reach of the cros but you'd think they were standing close to a poodle rather than a man-eating animal.

I don't mind a film being bad if it at least has a campy quality to this that Lake Placid did not. Betty White's foul-mouthed character was a scream...Cloris Leachman's character just makes you want to scream in terror. The DVD does come with two VERY short featurettes, each only about four minutes in length, adding little value to the DVD This could have been much better!",1208131200,8,3000,4.58955223880597
2991712,4,B000WTVZGC,"With an all-new cast one has to wonder what happened since the events of the first film.  In the first film there were two giant crocodiles and one of them was captured alive at the end.  And yet in this film there is only the slightest of rumors that a giant crocodile existed.  We have a new Sheriff and Game Warden.  The croc groupie has been replaced by a hunter.  Betty White's wonderful character mysteriously disappeared and has been replaced by a sister (Cloris Leachman).  Add a bunch of youngsters (mostly to increase the body count) and some gratuitous nudity (also supplied by the youngsters) you get almost the same film.
A researcher is killed right at the beginning and that prompts the beginning of the search.  Soon it is obvious that a croc is in the lake and the body count begins to rise.  Although the film pulls some of the same stunts and follows the same basic plot, there are a number of changes (some good and some bad).  All in all it seemed a little too much like a remake and too little like a sequel.  I find it hard to believe that a giant croc was removed from the lake and transported in plain sight in the first movie and there is no knowledge of it in the second.  As a remake it is a fun movie.  As a sequel it is just the same thing again with no new developments.  If you like giant croc films then you will probably want to see this one.",1205020800,2,1376,4.246153846153846

The man left standing just stands there and then he gives a few yelps of concern.  Next scene in the sheriff's office, the survivor has told his story and the deputies then proceed to giggle and joke and whoop, as if they've heard the funniest joke of the year.

Then the sheriff comes in and asks the survivor what's going on. The survivor yawns and says ""there's a problem"" out on the lake. He acts like he's stubbed his toe.

No  onein this truly horrible exercise in boredom ever acts in the least frightened or nervous about a giant croc roaming around.

2991716,1,B000WTVZGC,"Granted, LAKE PLACID was not Oscar winning material. But at least it was entertaining and kept your interest, offering a twist on the tried and true formula of a town not wanting to admit they had a problem (via JAWS). There are days when I still pull out this movie to watch again, enjoying the back and forth between characters and the witty dialogue they share. Not the case this time around.

This movie is so blatantly made for TV that it reeks of all that is bad with sequels made for that medium. The only difference between that and this is that here they can offer a bit of T & A to spark interest. But all of that is predictable and uninteresting. As I watched two nubile young wannabe actresses (one of which offers the worst reading of written dialogue that I can recall), I felt like the croc featured in this film was taking over for Jason Voorhees, attempting to seek retribution and slutty teens involved in or preparing for sex.

The film begins with a huge gross out moment as the assistant to an EPA agent gets his arm bitten off and then his other are left behind in the pair's boat. The local sheriff, played well by actor John Schneider, is in the midst of cardboard cutout problems with his for the summer son (the child of divorced parents) when he gets a call to come in. When he arrives, he is confronted with the small amount of remains from the attack.

Along with his ex-girlfriend and game warden Emily (Sarah Lefleur) the trio set out to see what exactly is in the Maine lake nearby. Though uneaten, they do get into a confrontation with the croc resulting in his munching down their boat and them narrowly escaping to the shore.

Enter the great white hunter Struthers (Sam McMurray), a rich man with a joy for the hunt who has crossed paths with Emily before. Beside him is his trusted companion Ahmad (Joe Holt), a laughingly bad character that appears to be a man Friday to a hopeless bumbler, never quite sure of how to play the character. Is he Sudanese or is he Jamaican? He does end up with one of the few good moments in the film when he tells an ungrateful employer what he can do after years of being treated poorly.

The group gets help when Schneider calls his deputy to bring out a new boat and some explosives. The deputy makes it to them without incident but when they attempt to lure the beast in and rope him after tranquilizing him, it wakes and makes a meal of the deputy. The funny part is that no one seems to care or show signs of remorse at the loss of their friend. Within minutes they're trading jokes about what to do next.

While all this unfolds, we also have the story of Schneider's son Scott as he makes friends with the local teens. At least with the young lady teen, Kerri. The rest of the group are stereotypical hard nosed teens who want to prove to the city boy they can be as intimidating as...well...as something. Who knows what because they appear to be nothing but goofs that you know don't have a chance of making it to the final reel.

Also on hand is Cloris Leachman as the sister of the character played by Betty White in film one. She's just as nuts and helps the crocs by feeding them steroid injected meat and the occasional person or two. Why no one has noticed up to this point is anyone's guess.

There is nothing original at all about this film, even though most sequels tend to be mere repetitions of the first film. But this one doesn't even come off as a good parody of that one. No witty dialogue, uncaring characters, poorly done CGI effects throughout (even a plane landing on the lake is CGI!) all result in one terrible movie.

Don't waste your time here. Instead, rent or buy the first one. Hmm...then again if you watch this one first and THEN watch the original, you might wonder why the Academy didn't consider it for Oscar worthiness.

There is one good thing about this movie. It is so bad that I found myself laughing throughout. Amazing how a comedy like THE COMEBACKS fails to inspire laughter while this movie offers more in the first 30 minutes.",1203379200,5,4047,4.398395721925134

3226079,3,B000WTVZGC,"Looking around all I see are negative reviews for Lake Placid 2 and I have to wonder what was everyone expecting? While the original did get over with the audience it's not seen as a classic of the genre, but as an enjoyable movie. Did anyone really expect Lake Placid 2 to be some kind of classic? The budget is obviously very low and Sci-Fi Pictures was involved right there you should know what to expect.

I see so many reviews calling this the worst movie ever; come on people lighten up. Is Lake Placid 2 a bad movie? Hell yeah, but it's also a lot of fun. The cast and crew knew the kind of movie they were making and make a B-movie that isn't meant to be taken seriously. All the comedy and idiotic moments are intentional.

Anybody who has read my reviews knows I'm not the biggest fan of CGI; I don't like and I probably never will. But the CGI in Lake Placid 2 is the best. And by best I mean worst. It's always easy to spot the CGI. Unless used very little you can always spot it and that sort of takes me out of the movie, but here the CGI is so fake looking it just makes the movie more fun. The Crocodiles are CGI and they look like something from Playstation. And the CGI gore also looks like something you would see playing Playstation.

Remember those old super low budget movies where they would put a guy a monsters suit and have him run around chasing people? Well Lake Placid 2 is sort of like that only with the CGI. Every time one of the Crocodiles appears on screen it's damn hysterical. Normally I hate CGI, but in this case I loved it since it really makes the movie even funnier.

The screenplay was written by Todd Hurvitz & Howie Miller and yeah it was a silly screenplay filled with characters saying and doing the dumbest of things. But that was the point; these guys weren't trying to write a Crocodile version of Jaws. They were writing a silly B-movie.

Director David Flores keeps the movie moving at a silly pace and never attempts at making a serious movie. He knew what kind of movie this was and makes that movie. There is always something silly happening to keep things silly and fun.

The actors were mostly good, yes you read that right. The main cast all put in the performances they were meant to. They put in a silly and even slightly over the top performances. The actors weren't meant to play it straight at all and they knew this and don't attempt to. John Schneider as Sheriff Riley was a blast. It was quite clear he was enjoying himself and puts in the performance he was meant to. And does this guy not age? He can easily pass for his 30s. Sarah Lafleur as Emily also puts in a fun and campy performance as the love interest for the Sheriff.

Chad Collins as Scott Riley and Alicia Ziegler as Kerri play it a little more-straight and actually both gave fairly good performances. Let's face it they didn't have the best of material, but both do rather well and I would like to see them in a more serious movie to see what they have acting wise. Cloris Leachman and Sam McMurray round out the cast; both actors have been around for quite a while and McMurray is one of those guys you know by face, but not name and he also seems to be having a lot of fun in his role as Struthers.

Bottom line is this by no means is Lake Placid 2 a good movie. It's a bad movie sure, but it's also fun in how idiotic it was. The CGI was horrible and adds to silliness of the movie. Fans of low brow so bad its good cinema might find some entertainment out of this. Don't except a good a movie or a scary movie. It's a silly movie that works on how bad it is. Lake Placid 2 is the type of movie you watch and make fun of. Don't take it so seriously.",1202169600,31,3683,4.184767277856135

3226083,4,B000WTVZGC,"Due to a state of recent disappearances, Deputy James Riley, (John Schneider) is confronted with evidence of something monstrous in the lake, forcing his ex-wife Emma Warner, (Sarah Lafleur) a Wildlife agent, to show up as well. Deciding to search around the lake, they find a giant crocodile that attacks their boat. When professional hunter Struthers, (Sam McMurray) shows up due to the rumors and sets up camp to hunt the crocodile, he stocks up for a war with the beast. While they're fighting, James' son Scott Riley, (Justin Ulrich) and his friend Kerri, (Alicia Ziegler) along with some of their friends soon find that not only are they also attacked by the crocodile, there's a small family of them living in the lake and who all decide to gang up on the two groups of survivors stranded on the lake. Finally realizing what they're up against, they decide to work together to stop their rampage before more fall victim to them.

The Good News: This was actually a pretty good creature feature. One of the best things is that it plays up the previous knowledge and manages to expand upon it. The end of the previous one set-up the fact that babies had been born, and this one here is where the children come back and strike out against intruders as adults. The constant mention of characters and situations being brought up simply tie the events together, and a rather decent attempt is made to make the constant interaction in the forest look similar, ensuring another small bit of continuity. That includes the next great feature, the different crocodiles. This is one of the few films that has several individuals of the threat for the characters to get around. Having four crocs to deal with is a pretty clever move, allowing it to drop the tiresome ""invincible creature"" motif and actually make some semblance of reality when they can kill off one of the creatures early on without making it seem like the characters are out of danger or the crocs are weak. That itself is a really great idea no matter what the angle played. Another really smart move is to make the existence of the creatures known fairly early in the film, as it does here, allowing for a lot of croc screen-time and playing in to the option of letting one of the other ones take over if one is killed option that it uses since there's more than one. With it being fairly obvious to the characters about twenty minutes or so into the film that there's something huge and vicious in the lake, and for this to be obvious to them is quite nice, as the search for them leads to some really great scenes. The search for the first croc on the lake is a nice action highlight, as the different tactics used to try to slow it down make some nice little action scenes in it. There's even a little back-and-forth as the croc puts up a valiant struggle and manages to take out several vehicles of the police force before being brought down when it seemed like it would've been the police force which had the upper hand. The assault on the campground is one of the highlights, as there's a lot of action with the first couple traps and the ensuing attack is nicely handled. It gets to it's parts, though, when it goes for the jungle attacks, as the assaults on the stranded campers comprise so many great scenes and moments that there's a lot to like in them. Handled with great skill and even allowing some creepy moments to come into play, these are simply great and really make the movie, along with the first lake capture, and make this a really worthy sequel.

The Bad News: There isn't a lot here that isn't to like. One of the only points is that, as usual, the crocodiles and the gore are completely CGI and don't look even the slightest bit real. It's not that they look off or unrealistic, as they look remarkably close to what they're supposed to be. It's simply the fact that the tone and appearance of the creatures are quite obviously not there. It's a bit distracting to see that the main threat of the film isn't there, and as it's so easily apparent of this, there's very little confusion about whether or not the effects are CGI or not. It's actually impossible to feel any threat of the crocs due to this state, which is just a common problem that so many similar films have. That the gore, which should've been a big highlight isn't that shocking or revolting because of the CGI aspects is another flaw, and just look fake, especially since the crocs have so much screen-time to get to see all the fake-ness of their design. Beyond these, this is an enjoyable film, but they will make it hard for some to get into the film.

The Final Verdict: While not up to the level of the first one, it's still a reasonably entertaining creature feature. The worse that can be said about it is that it's computer graphics are quite obviously fake, yet real creature feature fans won't mind this one bit and have some fun with it, so this is really only recommended to those kinds of viewers. All others shouldn't.",1199577600,4,4990,4.523809523809524

3226189,2,B000WTVZGC,"A sequel to Lake Placid (1999), the Sy Fy Channel Original Movie Lake Placid 2 (2007), continues the story of oversized crocodiles loose in Black Lake, Maine.  Without a particularly interesting story, the main attraction is probably the carnivorous beasts, but sadly the special effects in this made for TV movie, are barely adequate at best.  The crocs chomp people whole, and boldly crawl up on land to attack, but it's all rather unconvincing, often more funny than scary.

Sadie Bickerman (Cloris Leachman) has been feeding her pets meat loaded with growth hormones, causing the crocs to grow to enormous size.  When a scientist is attacked and killed on the lake, Sheriff James Riley (John Schneider) begins an investigation.  Also involved is Emma Warner (Sarah Lafleur), a Fish and Wildlife officer who is Riley's ex-girlfriend.  It's not long before the crocodiles strike again, destroying the Sheriff's boat, and forcing the party to swim for their lives.  Adding some color to the proceedings is the presence of Struthers (Sam McMurray), a hunter with questionable ethics, and his assistant Ahmad (Joe Holt).  Struthers has plans to bag a croc, but he seems to be better at shooting off his mouth, than his hunting rifle.  Also in the woods is Riley's son Scott (Chad Collins), and a group of teenagers who have their partying interrupted by the hungry crocs.

Lake Placid 2's weak script, bad dialog, and uninspiring special effects, makes it hard for anyone to look good, and John Schneider's laid back approach often giving the impression that he is barely awake.  Like many films of this type, the actors often appear silly interacting with CGI creatures, as people get chomped up, limbs are severed, and bullets have no effect.  Familiar ground for those acquainted with Sy Fy productions, but even graded on a curve, this one is average at best, with the kills and sharp tongued Sadie Bickerman the main source of entertainment value.  Sy Fy followed this with yet another sequel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lake-Placid-3-Unrated/dp/B003ZZ7TPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lake Placid 3 (Unrated)</a>&nbsp;(2010) that takes the series to a new low.

3226190,5,B000WTVZGC,"I once decried all those quickie SyFy (nee Sci-Fi) movies.  The overnight-written scripts, the over-the-weekend CGI effects, the second/third/fourth tier actors.  Not sophisticated enough for erudite and discerning me.  However, I found myself always tuning in to ""the most dangerous night on television"" to see the next big threat bested by a small gutsy band (hero, heroine, and several extras to be eaten/destroyed/immolated, etc).  Why?  As one of those Vietnam era vets, I cherished my weekends at the local drive-in in the 60's and 70's where, oddly enough, the same type of movies played.  Back then it was men in rubber monster suits demolishing miniature sets, or men in rubber alien costumes carrying away beautiful kicking blonds, or men in rubber . . . well, you get the point.  So, does a movie like ""Lake Placid 2"" remind me of my youth, or does it give me one more Saturday night to throw popcorn and laugh at the screen?  Doesn't matter.  I love this movie for the little pleasure it gives.  Like hearing your favorite Christmas carol once a year.

3226191,4,B000WTVZGC,"Within the creatures-on-the-loose genre exists the sub-category of crocogator flicks. Believe it or not, 2007's ""Lake Placid 2"" is one of the better entries in this genre. In my opinion it's more entertaining than the original 1999 film, which is hard to believe since this sequel went straight-to-DVD with a much lower budget (a mere $2 million compared to $27 million). Other than the budget and the cast ""Lake Placid 2"" is superior in practically every way:

- Although both films have a were-not-taking-this-too-seriously vibe, similar to ""Crocodile"" (2000) and ""Alligator"" (1980), ""Lake Placid 2"" is a little more serious than the original, which scores points in my book (but, don't get me wrong, there are quite a few funny and campy parts, like the incredibly casual way the Ranger responds toward people who have just perished).

- The babes are both more numerous and hotter. One good example is Sarah Lafleur (Emma) and her dive into the water early in the picture. Then you have Rachel and her white bikini (VJ Kewl, aka VJ Benson), stunning blond Edi (Zhasmina Toskova) and, lastly, the secondary protagonist, Kerri (Alicia Ziegler).

- The Bulgarian locations are superior to British Columbia. Not that B.C. isn't gorgeous but the story takes place in New England and Bulgaria is simply a better stand-in for Maine. (If you're not sure where Bulgaria is, it's located in Southeastern Europe by the Black Sea).

- Although the cgi crocs may not look as good as the first film, the kills are better, if you're into that sort of thing.

- The story, which is very similar to the original, is all-around better for what it is (a Grade-B nature-runs-amok flick).

Although the cast may not be as A-list as the first film, they came up with a good group of people led by John Schneider and all have fine chemistry together; they obviously had a fun time making this picture. John is a excellent leading man and perfect for these types of films. Some, of course, mock him because he played Bo Duke on The Dukes of Hazzard, but so what? How does that detract from his performance in this film or others of the same ilk, like ""Ogre""? He's an actor/entertainer and perfectly capable of playing different roles. Incidentally, he was in his late forties during filming and still looks great -- does the man ever age?!

Other highlights include Sarah Lafleur's face and hair; she's so uniquely cute it's somehow enjoyable to just look at her. Also, there are some really laugh-out-loud moments, like the ranger's comment near the end regarding the recurring white bunny, as well as a certain quasi-villain (Sam McMurray) whom I was just starting to really like, and then... well, I can't give it away. Other cast members not mentioned yet include Chad Michael Collins as Scott, Joe Holt as Ahmad and Cloris Leachman as Sadie, the old woman who regards the crocs as her ""kids.""

There's not much else to say. If you're in the mood for a crocogator flick you can't go wrong with ""Lake Placid 2"". Yes, it's a low budget, direct-to-DVD release but it's quite entertaining for what it is and compares well with the other films of the genre. Don't give heed to the grumps who rate it so lowly; they're wrong. It's almost on par with ""Crocodile"" and ""Alligator"" and in many ways better than the original ""Lake Placid.""

The movie runs 88 minutes.

I actually liked Cloris Leachman the best out of all of the actors (she was indeed scarier than the crocodile). I love campy movies but I just didn't see it in this movie.

The reason I am giving it three stars is for the last special feature - the ""Gnawed Up Version"" of the movie, which I didn't see anyone else mentioning. It is FABULOUS!! It fast forwards through all of the ""boring"" parts of the film and stops to regular speed on the boobs, croc, and carnage.

3226199,2,B000WTVZGC,"""Lake Placid 2"" is a more boring version of the original featuring former ""Dukes of Hazzard"" star John Schneider, a gigantic CGI crocodile, and Cloris Leachman as the local crazy lady (replacing Betty White from the original). This made in Bulgaria flick tries to re-create the frights and good humor of the original, but largely falls short.

Most of the acting is wooden, with Schneider turning in the best of the performances, although the beautiful Sarah Lafleur does her best as the Fish and Game Administration agent and love interest. The highlight is seeing Leachman acting insane and following in White's footsteps in encouraging the flourishing fauna in Lake Placid.

The crocodile is onscreen quite a bit and the CGI varies from acceptable to really bad. The crocodile serves as a substitute for plot; the story ambles on very predictably (especially if you saw the original), with occasional stabs at humor and titillation interspersed throughout.

On balance, ""Lake Placid 2"" is an unneeded sequel, and while there are certainly many better creatures-gone-wild movies, Leachman and numerous ridiculous situations make this watchable once through for fans of brainless camp films.",1226620800,,1192,5.296296296296297

  This is the best crocofilm of the subcrocoflicks - the second drawer of crockery.
  CGI, while not top-notch like the original, sometimes comes close, and to me is never really bad but just off a few times (Playstation can be pretty real sometimes you know!). So, CGIOK.

LP2 is
1) Finally a croc film where you do see a fair amount of the croc.
2) And - I can't believe it - it is always in the day! Though the real solidity is slightly lacking, and only once the beast enters sunlight - and it's when it's dappled; that sucks. Sometimes the detail gets quite good, showing even the inside of the mouth.

  Sure the pointier, snappier wit of the orig is not quite there, but at least it has wit, with bite! They do try much humour and I don't think it all as sad as most others do. Most so-called creature films don't have any humour, for fear of disturbing the seriousness, but are like food without spice or sauce, that goes down like unreality, or like having a meal without a drink. So hooray here!
 Plus it has some delicious desserts in carnage. Gratuitous beasts and gratuitous breasts!
 As always, the actors and plot are on par with the CGI.

THE OTHER BOTTOM DRAWER CROCKERY
Don't see Supercroc of **it (on the DVD extra, even the girl star said welcome to ""Super croc of..."" then she went quiet and laughed I think), where the nightly ghost croc is more lacking in detail.
Make sure you miss bloody Blood Surf, that croc out where you never even see the whole croc once - see it walking - but just the rubber head or front part. THAT is much worse than the meticulous care that goes into even undernourished CGI.
You can wait to see Primeval, the better of these two, with infuriating minimal croc action, always at night, and always spaztcroc.
And cop Croc. Unless it is the first or second croc film you've seen, is just the same routine filmed in minimalism again. Mostly real crocs are filmed, often with added CGI like an arm out the mouth, or else shoddy flashes of the crocodummy head.
Black Water I've yet to see seems above C-grade.

3226203,1,B000WTVZGC,"Avoid seeing this god awful excuse for a sequel to a movie that did not need a sequel done in the first place.

Bo Duke now resides in a small town, and this guy who was out on a boat with his friend are attacked by a crocodile. When he reports it, Bo Duke does not beleive him and the sheriffs department think it is a joke.

However, even after Bo is shown evidence of what is left of the first victim of one of the crocs, he continues to smile, joke around like he could not care about anything less in the world.

Along the way you meet characters who can not act for SHIpenuTs, but got the part cause they where willing to take there cloths off at the drop of a hat.

Each character in the movie seems to be done in a lame way. You can not beleive any of the characters, the acting itself is dreadful on most actors part, and the plot is almost the same as the original movie.

This time around, Cloris Leachmen plays the sister of Rose from the golden girls. And it's just too corny, and too predictable what her story is. But the thing about her character, is she was one of the actors in the movie who wasn't doing a terrible job, but the character she was given was like monkeys wrote the part.

If the acting and some of the accents and the characters where not bad enough, then there is the CGI. For a movie made in 2007, you do not expect to see CGI work that looks like it was from 1997. The croc's looked unbelievably bad, and the way they move are just in no way at all believable.

Anyone who has seen a real croc or alligator know they are not slow moving creatures, they pounce out of the water at speeds you have to see to beleive. And they can use there tails to launch many feet into the air. Yet the characters in this movie have no trouble out swimming a croc, hiding in a tree about 5 foot in the air, and have plenty of time to see a croc coming for them and decide what they will have for lunch next Tuesday before opening fire at one of these things.

I know sometimes you can suspend belief and just go with being entertained by a movie, but this one just does so many things that stand out in a bad way that you can't sit back and just enjoy it.

The script writer seemed to have had a decent story going, but the way it was filmed... it's like the director never did the scenes over and over to get the best one, he was like, ""do it once....that will do, next""

The plots and ideas behind it where just lame, bad or leaving you thinking, ""what where they thinking?"" and thats what I say to this movie overall.

There is one more thing I did not like about this movie. The way it was shot, directed, cut together and even the way it was acted... if they cut out the un-needed nudity, this movie would be rated PG.

Which audience did they plan to show this to? Cause the adult audience are definitely saying how bad and lame it is. And at many points in the movie, I thought I was watching a kids movie.

If you have a program like NERO, use one of it's features to cut out the nudity scenes, then show it to a kid under 13. Then ask them if they thought any of the movie was the slightest bit scary?

This movie has no idea which way it should go, family movie, or more mature audience, and by the final cut of this thing, it's the useless nudity thats the only thing that gets it a rating above PG13.",1213833600,,3331,4.050228310502283

3226208,1,B000WTVZGC,"When Lake Placid came out in 1999 it was a bit of a surprise hit and better than it had a right to be, partly because it was a campy ode to monster movies of the 1950's. Still, it was not a film that I thought would have been worthy of generating a sequel, particularly so many years later. Lake Placid 2 originally premiered on the Sci-Fi Channel several months ago but has now been released on DVD in an unrated version. More on that in a moment.

Once again were back at the quaint Maine setting and the serene lake where the first film took place. John Schneider is Sheriff Riley, living with his teenaged son Scott (Chad Collins). I have to say that Schneider looks very good. With his hair longer, he looks almost as young as he did in his Dukes of Hazzard days, and much younger than he did in Smallville. Unfortunately Schneider seems to know he's in a bit of a clunker here and doesn't generate a lot of electricity for a guy in the lead role.

The plot in Lake Placid is pretty identical to the first film with just new characters: Small town sheriff, cute co-star Emily(Lefleur) who is an agent of the Fish & Wildlife department, and another crazy old hag. This time its scary looking Cloris Leachman playing Sadie Bickerman, the sister of Betty White's character from the original film. With two Mary Tyler Moore show alums used so far, who's on tap for Lake Placid 3, Valerie Harper?

Anyway, after the first crocodile attack, Riley mobilizes his, um, deputy to begin a search of the lake along with Emily who is apparently an old flame but that's never complexly explained. Their search is interrupted by the appearance of a big game hunter named Struthers and his assistant Ahmad who've come to kill the beast. Meanwhile, Scott and his friends have picked that day to go swimming in the lake and I'm sure you can guess what happens to most of them.

So what makes the DVD unrated? A little swearing and some topless girls. Granted, the girls are damn hot but they are killed very quickly. Honestly there's about 90 seconds of material...maybe...which make the movie ""unrated"" over what was shown on TV. The CGI is typical of a Sci-Fi channel film...in other words...bad. I've seen documentaries on the Discovery Channel, which had better CGI effects than this film. There's just no believing that the croc is interacting with the actors at any time. Making matters worse is the actors themselves to a weak job in making the scenes believable. There are several occasions where the actors are within arm's reach of the cros but you'd think they were standing close to a poodle rather than a man-eating animal.

I don't mind a film being bad if it at least has a campy quality to this that Lake Placid did not. Betty White's foul-mouthed character was a scream...Cloris Leachman's character just makes you want to scream in terror. The DVD does come with two VERY short featurettes, each only about four minutes in length, adding little value to the DVD This could have been much better!",1208131200,8,3000,4.58955223880597
3226209,4,B000WTVZGC,"With an all-new cast one has to wonder what happened since the events of the first film.  In the first film there were two giant crocodiles and one of them was captured alive at the end.  And yet in this film there is only the slightest of rumors that a giant crocodile existed.  We have a new Sheriff and Game Warden.  The croc groupie has been replaced by a hunter.  Betty White's wonderful character mysteriously disappeared and has been replaced by a sister (Cloris Leachman).  Add a bunch of youngsters (mostly to increase the body count) and some gratuitous nudity (also supplied by the youngsters) you get almost the same film.
A researcher is killed right at the beginning and that prompts the beginning of the search.  Soon it is obvious that a croc is in the lake and the body count begins to rise.  Although the film pulls some of the same stunts and follows the same basic plot, there are a number of changes (some good and some bad).  All in all it seemed a little too much like a remake and too little like a sequel.  I find it hard to believe that a giant croc was removed from the lake and transported in plain sight in the first movie and there is no knowledge of it in the second.  As a remake it is a fun movie.  As a sequel it is just the same thing again with no new developments.  If you like giant croc films then you will probably want to see this one.",1205020800,2,1376,4.246153846153846

Then the sheriff comes in and asks the survivor what's going on. The survivor yawns and says ""there's a problem"" out on the lake. He acts like he's stubbed his toe. Even after the sheriff is nearly murdered by the fake looking monster, he's laughing and joking just seconds later. No  onein this truly horrible exercise in boredom ever acts in the least frightened or nervous about a giant croc roaming around. Even when they witness one of their own being swallowed alive, they're laughing and joking just seconds later.

In another scene, the monster starts dragging a girl into the water. She swats him with her purse. A second later, the survivors are laughing and joking. In another scene, a smart aleck thug is spouting off about how there're not any monster crocs. Then the monster creeps up behind him. The others stare at him and say, ""Eh, you'd better move."" It's like they've got a skunk or a dog lurking just a few feet away. When the thug is swallowed, the others dash away but then they're back to laughing and joking again. I couldn't watch anymore. This could be a terrific joke movie to show while having a party and everyone would probably die laughing. For a real party treat, they could show this dog and that cult masterpiece, HANDS OF MANOS, for a real blow-out.",1204502400,,1914,4.5523255813953485
3226212,1,B000WTVZGC,The special effects of the crocodiles are so so. But they do not look scary. the plot and  the acting are below average. There are a lot of logical holes. There's no suspense.,1204329600,,175,4.303030303030303
3226213,1,B000WTVZGC,"Granted, LAKE PLACID was not Oscar winning material. But at least it was entertaining and kept your interest, offering a twist on the tried and true formula of a town not wanting to admit they had a problem (via JAWS). There are days when I still pull out this movie to watch again, enjoying the back and forth between characters and the witty dialogue they share. Not the case this time around.

This movie is so blatantly made for TV that it reeks of all that is bad with sequels made for that medium. The only difference between that and this is that here they can offer a bit of T & A to spark interest. But all of that is predictable and uninteresting. As I watched two nubile young wannabe actresses (one of which offers the worst reading of written dialogue that I can recall), I felt like the croc featured in this film was taking over for Jason Voorhees, attempting to seek retribution and slutty teens involved in or preparing for sex.

The film begins with a huge gross out moment as the assistant to an EPA agent gets his arm bitten off and then his other are left behind in the pair's boat. The local sheriff, played well by actor John Schneider, is in the midst of cardboard cutout problems with his for the summer son (the child of divorced parents) when he gets a call to come in. When he arrives, he is confronted with the small amount of remains from the attack.

Along with his ex-girlfriend and game warden Emily (Sarah Lefleur) the trio set out to see what exactly is in the Maine lake nearby. Though uneaten, they do get into a confrontation with the croc resulting in his munching down their boat and them narrowly escaping to the shore.

Enter the great white hunter Struthers (Sam McMurray), a rich man with a joy for the hunt who has crossed paths with Emily before. Beside him is his trusted companion Ahmad (Joe Holt), a laughingly bad character that appears to be a man Friday to a hopeless bumbler, never quite sure of how to play the character. Is he Sudanese or is he Jamaican? He does end up with one of the few good moments in the film when he tells an ungrateful employer what he can do after years of being treated poorly.

The group gets help when Schneider calls his deputy to bring out a new boat and some explosives. The deputy makes it to them without incident but when they attempt to lure the beast in and rope him after tranquilizing him, it wakes and makes a meal of the deputy. The funny part is that no one seems to care or show signs of remorse at the loss of their friend. Within minutes they're trading jokes about what to do next.

While all this unfolds, we also have the story of Schneider's son Scott as he makes friends with the local teens. At least with the young lady teen, Kerri. The rest of the group are stereotypical hard nosed teens who want to prove to the city boy they can be as intimidating as...well...as something. Who knows what because they appear to be nothing but goofs that you know don't have a chance of making it to the final reel.

Also on hand is Cloris Leachman as the sister of the character played by Betty White in film one. She's just as nuts and helps the crocs by feeding them steroid injected meat and the occasional person or two. Why no one has noticed up to this point is anyone's guess.

There is nothing original at all about this film, even though most sequels tend to be mere repetitions of the first film. But this one doesn't even come off as a good parody of that one. No witty dialogue, uncaring characters, poorly done CGI effects throughout (even a plane landing on the lake is CGI!) all result in one terrible movie.

Don't waste your time here. Instead, rent or buy the first one. Hmm...then again if you watch this one first and THEN watch the original, you might wonder why the Academy didn't consider it for Oscar worthiness.

There is one good thing about this movie. It is so bad that I found myself laughing throughout. Amazing how a comedy like THE COMEBACKS fails to inspire laughter while this movie offers more in the first 30 minutes.",1203379200,5,4047,4.398395721925134
3226214,1,B000WTVZGC,"I am 31 years old and have seen thousands of movies.  This movie has got to be in my top three when it comes to the worst acting and storyline ever.  The special effects were horrible and the super fast land crocs were utterly ridiculous.  However, I am just mesmerized by how god awful the acting was.  Seriously, I have seen ""B"" movies that were supposed to be corny with better acting.  I am now wondering if this movie is supposed to be some bad acting joke and it hasn't been announced yet?

While it is filled with your cliched idea's you'd expect to find in a film about reptiles eating their pray from a comedy horror perspective, it was not for me. If you are enthralled by genetically engineered creatures of the deep then this is probably for you. What I will say is Jaws, Deep Blue Sea, Tremors were good films I liked in comparison. This is B grade at best, if that. Do you want good comedy horror?  I'd suggest you should look more along the lines of something like The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Beetle Juice, Gremlins, Cabin in the woods - (Post Modern), The Lost Boys, The Frighteners and  Little Shop of Horrors.",1519344000,,685,4.3858267716535435
