4684476,5,B005FQ2HBO,"I had bought the first season of crime story, 5 years ago .It was dark, the packing was shody,and the sound was so horrible, I didn't even bother to order the second season.
  I recived the 25 the anniversary set,AND I WAS BLOWN AWAY!!! Here was my favorite show of my childhood, as I remebered it. The new remastered picture and sound,are outstanding....the only complaint I had at all , there still is no play all button on the dvds. Besides that , it was about time, this show got the respect it so richly deserved!!!",1323475200,6,520,4.40625
4684477,4,B005FQ2HBO,"SEASON ONE: The picture and sound quality of CRIME STORY--THE 25th ANNIVERSARY edition is GREAT.  I have no idea if Image Entertainment did any remastering, but the picture looks the SAME to my eyes as the original broadcast on NBC--in other words--it looks **FINE**--I have no complaints.  SEASON TWO: As other reviewers have mentioned, many of the Season Two episodes (unfortunately) have noticable digital artifacts--the picture definitely isn't as clear as the original broadcast, but it's good enough.  Also, it **APPEARS** that this DVD set features ALL(?)...or at least MOST of the ORIGINAL MUSIC--I viewed all of the episodes in this set and virtually every episode features 1960's music--PERFORMED BY THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS--there are no ""covers"" or replacement songs as far as I can determine (and I am by no  means an expert on either vintage music or the CRIME STORY series).  Also, this DVD edition features Chapter Stops--something that the previous versions released by Anchor Bay didn't have.  There is **ONE ERROR** though--the Season 2 episodes ""Byline"" (on disc #9) and ""The Hearings"" (on disc #8) are presented in REVERSE ORDER (view ""Byline"" FIRST and THEN view ""The Hearings"").  To sum up, CRIME STORY--THE 25th ANNIVERSARY EDITION is a **HUGE** improvement over the Anchor Bay editions--and the price (currently $19.99) is a steal!  This DVD set is an AWESOME viewing experience--don't hesitate to order it!",1321833600,71,1428,5.287610619469026

4684479,3,B005FQ2HBO,"No Response part 2.
  I never did get a response from Image Entertainment. But I have received Crime Story and have reviewed the first two discs. The picture seems dark and the original was dark on my tapes as well. That's why they have brightness controls on the TV's. I compared the soundtracks on disc one episodes to the same on the tapes. They seem to be the same. Disc two on the other hand wanders off to 60's style music, but not the original used in the show. I feel sure it will be the same through out. I can't seem to get past disc 2 right now. Personally I'm ready for 3, but someone always comes and gets wrapped up in it and wants to see the beginning. I have seen disc 1 and 2 now 3 times. It was over Thanksgiving when family and friends dropped by unexpectedly when I was trying to watch it. For those that have never seen the show but are familiar with the late 50's and early 60's loved the cars and pre police restrictions on handling criminals. The pilot consists of Torella saying, ""I'm a cop, I make $10,000 a year and the highest paid guy out here. I have $3.12 in my pocket. If you want, I'll take up a collection. You want a million dollars, it will take some time.""  They didn't really care or know the music was different. I know it's different, but on the other hand, I'm watching the show and enjoying the shows content and not paying much attention to the background music. It has the 60's beat and fits in. If I want to hear those songs, I can pull out my old 45's and put em on my turntable and enjoys my 50's again. You do know what 45's and the term turntable are?  Don't you?
For $20, it still beats most of the current hum drum cop shows and boring commercial interruptions, pop ups, and speedy credit runs, that plague TV of today. Personally, I would rather watch some of yesteryears shows than most of today's current runs. THIS channel and ME-TV are doing just that, except they are following the normal syndication procedures and cutting material to allow for commercials.
In short, is it worth the $20. You betchya.",1317340800,11,2059,4.298969072164948
4684480,3,B005FQ2HBO,"I sold my two seasons of Crime Story.  One of the best dramas on television got a crappy makeover on DVD.  One of the DVD was in bad quality like it was some sort of a bootleg copy.
It's a cryin' shame that NBC canceled the series before resolving the cliffhanger.  If you don't care that this show never truly ended than you might be happy; but like I said, the DVD could have been made much better with restoration.",1316131200,7,417,4.1875

Now I've have the original Anchor Bay set season 1 watchable dvd rip...but season 2 is a complete disaster by far the worst dvd season set I own (worse than Earth the final conflict sets) unless Image entertainment does a basic job of remastering the complete set (especially season 2) (nothing fancy mind you like Shout! did with the Adam 12 sets) I can not justify a double dip.

Even though the video quality is lacking, it's still a riveting show, and I recommend the series to anyone who likes cop/detective shows (or the always enjoyable Dennis Farina).

4684492,5,B005FQ2HBO,"A ground-breaking series which was produced between 1986 and 1988. Well worth watching, even in the old 4:3 screen ratio, if only for the great locations, cars, clothes, and hairdo's!  But the acting and scripts are also first rate.

The whole series (really just two seasons) centers around Mike Torello, a cop played by Dennis Farina, and his obsession with bringing a gangster, Ray Luca (Tony Denison), to justice in the 60's.  They start out in Chicago, but shortly after, the series moves to Las Vegas for the duration, when Luca relocates there to take over the crime syndicates.  Torello and his entire team (wonderfully played by Bill Smitrovich, Billy Campbell, and others) are appointed federal agents and follow him.

The Chicago and Las Vegas locations are terrific:  fabulous 50's-type drive-ins, night clubs, motels.  Magnificent cars:  period Chryslers, Cadillacs, Fords, etc., in mint condition and beautifully photographed.

There are some holes in the story and, it seems, nothing can stick to Luca.  It does seem surprising that the feds can't get him on tax evasion like Capone, but that wouldn't make for much drama.  There is a lot of tough moments with extreme violence, but also many tender moments between Torello and his team.

One could also wish for a more beautiful print.  Even though this is an 'anniversary' production, the picture quality varies quite a bit, and sometimes looks like a DVD copy of a VHS print.  But there are some episodes that look quite good, especially in the rare instances when there is a lot of light.  Much of the series takes place at night and in dark places, so clarity suffers.

But the story and characters (both the 'good guys' and 'bad') are compelling, and I found myself forgiving a lot of things because I love the series.  The period music makes a great accompaniment and I even watched the credits just to hear it.

This is as good as we are likely to get in the foreseeable future so, if all this sounds good, don't hesitate to partake.",1509408000,7,2006,4.815789473684211

Ahh, I dunno, I'd seen him in movies and what's the deal...

You gotta see Crime Story, you gotta see Crime Story...they kept telling me, oh for Chrissakes, it's a 2 Season Series, that's a lotta time to invest, I said.

Michael Mann, they told me, you outta your mind? Just rent it, get it, watch it, you'll love it...

Rent it? That's a lotta dough for a 9 disc set that is probably gonna have a few or more discs beat to heck from other slobs like me handling them in between attacking a Hoagie with extra onions and lotsa mustard, what can you do (pass the BBQ potato chips, honey)?

Hey now, good old Amazon has these fer cheap, and this is gonna happen, here I go, steady, there's the buy it now button, bingo. Cut to the chase, it was in my mailbox and I watched it, make that DEVOURED it well over a year ago, and lately have been thinking about it and want to watch it again and here's my review to tell you that even a hold-out, semi-brain-dead skeptic  like myself can become a believer.

The first disc has 4 episodes. I defy you to watch that disc and not develop a burning anticipation to watch the rest. Even better news is that it just gets better and better from there; a few of the last episodes of Season 2 seemed a bit on the thinner side, but even those were watchable, just somewhat 'hurried', in my bumbled opinion.

Any series featuring both Pam Grier AND Deborah Harry in the cast belonged in my viewing range a long time ago, and I won't even get into all the other acting talent herein, if you don't know the show, dive in, it's a winner of the crime genre!

the second season was suppose to be set in las vegas 1980 but New world pictures were financing the series
and for Budget reasons New world didn't have the cash to spend on a 1980 setting
so instead season 2 episodes are set in Las vegas between 1964-65
both seasons are like one big Movie actually that Michael mann executive produced, Michael also Directed some episodes
every episode is worth watching Great acting performances, Great script writing, Great Directing
Image entertainment have reissued released both seasons on DVD now in 1:33:1 ratio
advertising it as 25th Anniversary edition, well what Bulls*** very insulting
cause the Digital remaster transfers for every episode are very Grainy & Dirty so they're tolerable to watch
 so Image did a rush Job with the picture quality season 1 is about 5/10 for the picture quality
season 2 picture quality is actually slightly better maybe 7/10
the sound quality is lot better Dolby digital stereo mix
EXTRAS well there are none, Image could've got a new retrospect interview with Dennis Farina & Michael mann
but ofcourse they didn't bother
the packaging is terrible each 2 discs are on flip over plastic rectangle trays, not Disc trays inside clamshell case
the Australian dvd Distributor SHOCK has the Discs on flip trays inside plastic clamshell case which i think is much better packaging
the SHOCK DVD is NTSC All regions
if you prefer the AUS dvd seasons 1 & 2 you can buy them of ebay.com.au

However, for every two or three good shows, there would be a bad show (I mean a real stinkeroo) with plots so thin you could read the bad script pages through them. Some of them used the character Paulie so poorly that you knew no one, and I mean NO ONE could be as stupid as he was depicted and not be in an institution for the terminally goofy.

The sad thing is that as the show went on, the bad scripts started to out weigh the good scripts. For instance: No one could possibly out run an atomic bomb blast in a car and survive. Particularly if they are caught in a shock wave as strong as the one shown.

Further, from a technical standpoint, the transfer to DVD left a lot to be desired. Some shows were very uneven and overall, the picture and sound definition on a number of the were substandard.

4684541,5,B005FQ2HBO,"I remember this series being televised late at night (9.30 onward) and if I hadn't gone to sleep while watching it, I missed episodes for some other reason. When I started to watch this production on DVD, I realised why I couldn't 'get into it'. It's because, unlike ""the Sweeney"" or ""The Professionals"" it falls in between a  series and a serial. Although some of the episodes are stand alone, there is a thread where the storyline is predicated on previous episodes. Occasionally, an episode does a summary of what has gone before as it is easy to lose direction in this lengthy production. The 'feel' of the show was brilliantly authentic and I was particularly taken by the 1960's cars (automobiles), those gorgeous Yank-tanks usually with fins which because of their soft suspension gently rock themselves to sleep after they've stopped. A puzzling feature was the weather. I must admit I was astonished when I walked out of a casino one evening and found the streets to be sopping wet. In the DVD, nearly every scene is a vista of wet streets. But isn't this the Mojave Desert? I looked Las Vegas up and it says it has about 26 wet days a year and the annual rainfall is 4.2 inches (110 mm). That's half-an-hour's rain in Australia. So why so much rain? Was this a symbolic gesture by the makers as water is a cleansing agent? Is there the suggestion that cleaning up Las Vegas is a protracted endeavour? I don't pretend to know the answer.

It is usual to comment on the plot and the characters and the performances and I am assuming these have been covered by other reviewers other than to say I couldn't fault any of them. There are a several who deserve special mention. Strangely, it's always the most flawed characters that seem to be the most attention-getting if not endearing. Ted Levine (before his ""Monk"" days) whose resume is surprisingly long is excellent as the street smart survivor. He turns in an impeccable performance a a craven, savvy, unscrupulous opportunist whose personal standards are beneath contempt, and is loyal to no-one but himself. In contradistinction, John Santucci who does have a sense of loyalty even if misplaced is excellent as the witless lieutenant to Ray Luca who thinks that the most complicated philosophical and mathematical problems can be solved with a gun. I would add that Joseph Wiseman (Dr No) is excellent as the genteel but lethal overlord Manny Weisbord.

This is a production well worth getting to add to your collection.",1462838400,,2482,4.767441860465116

4684554,4,B005FQ2HBO,"The series is fantastic, with Dennis Farina as driven Chicago cop Martin Torello in relentless pursuit of crime lord Ray Luca played by Anthony Denison. The story travels from Chicago to Las Vegas to (in the last few episodes) someplace in Central America. The writing is great, the acting is excellent (particularly Farina, who just strikes you as a decent, believable guy.) The narrative continues through both series (sometimes implausibly, as it seems Ray Luca always manages to evade capture... and even survive atomic blasts?!) and the episodes definitely hold your attention. It's amusing to watch how in this 80's-era drama (set in the 1960's) how plenty of actors from Miami Vice show up along the way, and how it can't completely escape that 80's Miami Vice feel (at one point I could have sworn the characters were in Lt. Martin Castillo's office).  The music, although rich with ""oldies"" is decent, but there's no driving Jan Hammer score going on here, just forgettable electronic music. Clever series with a few cheesy moments (like the ridiculous 'Pauly's dream' - the series seemed to put flashback sequences to use quite a good deal) and the final episode well, judge for yourself but I thought that was a cheesy departure for the series.

As for the packaging of this series - highly disappointing. Not only are there no extras, specials, interviews, etc, but the episodes aren't even in order!  I had to jump ahead to disk 9 for ""Byline"" which featured a story leading up to ""The Hearings"", which was back on disk 8?  Seriously?  A few more extras, and the series in order, would have improved this tremendously.",1453334400,,1631,4.894927536231884

4684580,3,B005FQ2HBO,"Presently watching Crime Story.  Even though I love police dramas, detectives and mystery movies there is something about Crime Story that doesn't quite sit well with me viewing these stories.  Maybe because it is set with the storylines of bad boys and organised gangs in Chicago.  We have a series here in Australia that I didn't like so I did not watch, it was a similar type thing about organised crime gangs.  As far as Crime Story goes I will watch all the episodes with breaks in between with other movies.  Please this is only my opinion but I certainly have not contemplated shelving it.  7/8/15 Have finished watching Crime Story, as I mentioned previously it is not quite to my liking but the last disc I did like the storyline.  The only final comment is that I was very disappointed with the ending, not what I expected or wanted to see.",1436572800,,850,4.552631578947368

4684588,4,B005FQ2HBO,"This excellent program follows a special investigation unit which is going after the Mob in general and Ray Luka in particular. Set in 1963 it is fun to watch for the neon lights and the cars and for the most part the plots are pretty good. The team starts out in Chicago and then moves to Las Vegas when it becomes clear that this will be the center of new and bigger Mob scheme. These agents are just as tough as the criminals they are chasing, which was always my favorite part of the show.

 I watched this when it first came out and really enjoyed it (even though I'm not normally big on police programs). Great period music but the incidental music can be a little jarring at times... not sure if that was deliberate or not.",1432339200,,730,4.282608695652174

The video transfer isn't ideal, but it might be an artifact of 80s TV-DVD (I don't have the tech chops to say). There's a great deal of pleasure to be seen in early performances by actors who've gone on to successful careers, and it's hard to argue with any series that has a cameo by Miles Davis.

The technical quality of the show is no where near something like the Soparanos.  First is film quality - the scenes are dark and are even more noticeably dark on the big flat screen.  I guess the style of depicting criminals has changed, but this is a very brutal bunch of guys - to the point of being unrealistic by today's standards.",1389571200,,513,4.257731958762887

4684665,4,B005FQ2HBO,"Stylish throwback to a time when Michael Mann's work dominated several media. The series starts out with incredible visual and plotting impact, but becomes less and less interesting as the major crimes unit leaves Chicago -- where most of them really did grow up and get their professional starts -- and sinks into the mire of Vegas. Still, it's a cinematographic gem and a walking style show. Loved the performances of Dennis Farina, Bill Smitrovich, John Santucci, Anthony Denison, Darlanne Fleugel, Stephen Lang,  -- many of whom worked multiple times with Mann. The sets are marvelous and the stable of 50's and 60's automobiles unsurpassed. But Chicago was this show's home turf and it never should have left.",1383782400,,714,5.0508474576271185

4684668,4,B005FQ2HBO,"Crime Story was a fantastic Crime Drama set in the venerable Chi-town of the early 1960s. Filmed some 25 years before Mad Men - with terrific period cars, costuming and story lines, this is a fantastic show -! however there is a downside. - the DVD transfer on this is barely standard definition and is almost like they ran a DVD recording session from a Betamax. Sadly in 2013 ; This is the only way to view this Michael Mann project ( Miami Vice / etc )

There are many reasons to watch this series including the appearances of so many actors very early in their careers. You will find yourself on your ipad looking up things as this is like a journey through an old photo album.

4684674,5,B005FQ2HBO,"I once briefly saw this on ""C"" Band Satelite and was interested, but forgot about it in favor of some of the other series that I was following at the time. Later when I went looking for it agan I had forgotten the name. Thanks to the internet and specificaly IMDB, I found it and ordered it from Amazon. I was not disapointed.
Like the Peter Gunn series, it brought back a lot of old memories of the times with the great Automobiles and the Classic Rock and Cool Jazz Music.(Peter Gunn).I highly recomend this series to those of us ""old fogies"" who grew up in the 50's and 60's and fondly remember the days before Political Correctness and Progressive Liberalism dictated our lives.
I must admit though I was not happy with the final ending of the series, or the anouncement of Dennis Farina's passing. He brought a sense of the hard boiled cop.common to that period of Television and Movie drama, because before he took up acting, he actually was a cop.

4684679,4,B005FQ2HBO,This is a great show with good story lines and a great cast. I have only good things to say about the show. My only complaint is with the DVD package. The sound of them talking isn't great you have to turn it way up but you can hear the music and there is no subtitles. The show is fantastic. Dennis Farina and Tony Denison are great as enemies.

If you like clear cut, good guys vs bad guys stories you need to see this series.  It follows the long running battle between our hero, Dective Lt Mike Torello and his Major Crime Unit (all hard bitten tough cops) and the evil (but really cool) bad guy, Ray Luca, as Luca rises through the Mob.  The series is fascinating as each of them alternately gain the upper hand and then lose it.  Story is set in Chicago in the early sixties so the fashions, cars, and expressions are really fun to listen to if you were around back then (or even is you weren't and are trying to get a feel for it).  An added treat is the music which is straight out of that time frame and which by itself is worth the cost of admission.",1377216000,,813,4.219354838709678

No.  But, if one enjoys classic or rock and roll on vinyl through tube type amplifiers.....high end system components, Crime Story looks and feels authentic.

4684686,2,B005FQ2HBO,"So, I received my 25th anniversary DVD set released by Image Entertainment today, and have a few observations to share.

One, the music seems to be the same as the Anchor Bay individual season sets, which I know is a concern for some folks.

Two, the transfer of the Image set is worse than the Anchor Bay season sets, with more artifacting, more grain (who would have thought that was possible), and a great deal of pops and scratches.

Three, the season two episodes are wildly out of order, with at least six episodes swapped. This does not seem intentional, as it does nothing to make the season more linear, in fact, it leads to great confusion as events unfold that make no sense in the order presented here.

The packaging is attractive but bare bones, and is at least in a sort of digibook format making it less clunky and awkward than the first season of the Anchor Bay release. The title card and menu screen is a blurry static image that has been stretched and distorted, and there is no ""play all"" option, so you have to return to the menu and select each episode individually.

The show itself is in my opinion, one of the all time greats. Much has been written here in some very in depth and spot on reviews of the show, as well as elsewhere on the Internet. A stellar cast, led by the always amazing Dennis Farina (may he rest in peace), and a young, dangerous Anthony Dennison. The writing is top notch, the characters well fleshed out, and the period music, cars and fashion are perfectly done. I'm not going to say much more here about the show, as I'm focusing this review on the DVD set itself, which falls short on so many levels.

This just makes me ache all the more for a restored and remastered blu ray set that will likely never come, but that is no less than this show deserves.",1374624000,3,1805,4.389221556886228

4684688,5,B005FQ2HBO,"This series takes me back to the 1980's and some fond memories. From the opening song to Dennis Farina playing Lt. Torello of the Major Crimes Unit to his mission of putting Ray Luca away one way or the other, I always found the time to park myself in front of the television when Crime Story was on.

Crime Story was one of the great TV experiments. I first watched it on my Last Black and White TV... Yes I did not let it go till 1986... With an all star cast and for those of you who can remember... a real good feel for police behavior in the early 60's....

You'll read about the ending on several reviews... ignore them... the show never made it to the 3rd Season....

Imagine a TV series with real life characters in real life situations in a great blend of nostalgia and style. And to boot both Dennis Farina and John Santucci in real life were cops and robbers. Farina was a chicago cop, hired as a technical advisor, he became an actor. And John Santucci was a a jewel their in real life....and was actually busted by Farina for real. I love this series, it is a real life depiction of bad and good guys, with a musical score done by none other than Al Kooper touted in the credits as ""the guy who picks the songs"". The action is great, the music is great, the characters are great and if you are a clothing and car buff, well this series is a must.",1360972800,2,786,4.211920529801325

4684717,5,B005FQ2HBO,"This series was great.  At first I was watching one episode a day and towards the middle I couldn't get enough.  Dennis Farina and his crew are pretty likeable, and the gangsters (Luka and Paully) are equally interesting to watch.

There is a lot of range to these characters.  Each episode is a continuation from a time standpoint of the previous one.  And the episodes are not run of the mill.  Towards the middle and to the end there are some pretty original and cool episodes.  This was not a predictable show at all.

To me this was a best mob movie I had seen.  The picture and sound looked good to me.  However, it looks sort of like a video tape.  I still watch them so to me it doesn't matter.  Also for this price getting the whole series it was a great deal.

Also you see a lot of known actors when they were young, but the stars of the show are Farina, (Luka and Paully).

Highly recommended,

It showed cops doing thins in gray areas instead of some black and white sense of right and wrong. Dennis Farina was great as the leader of the MCU and he had a great supporting cast including Bill Smitrovic and David Abrams. Antony Denison, Ted Levine, and John Santucci were great as the criminals. The crews efforts to make it look and sound like the 1960s paid off. This is not just a shoot-em-up it has action and drama, it show us some of what goes on in the characters lives, instead of just showing us what they do at work. The two problems with this are the music which is not the original music in the series, a small problem as the music wasn't really a part of the story, the big problem is the picture quality, which is the same as the videos I had of it in the 90s, you would think that they could do a better of job of digitizing it, looks like they just copied the video right to the DVD with no processing whatsoever, but, it is not so bad as to be unwatchable. For those of you who like Police Dramas this is a good bet, unfortunately, you may not be able to preview this series online as it doesn't seem to be readily available to view online, Amazon or Netflix don't have it, maybe try Hulu.",1351296000,3,1483,4.72972972972973
4684720,5,B005FQ2HBO,"Pros: Well done, well thought out and keeps your attention. Set in 1963 with all the old classic cars and some excellent era music too. Good actor/actresses you can see at their start off era that continued their acting careers later on in life.
Cons: Dennis Farina should have had a better physical appearance, which he is capable of. The story gets hard to follow at some points and it's worth watching over again once you have been through it once to fully understand the characters and story plot(s)",1350172800,,503,4.662921348314606

I own hundreds of DVDs including many other ""budget"" TV sets that put too many episodes per disc so I wasn't expecting the picture quality to be great. After watching the first 10 episodes, I can say that this release has the worst video quality of any official DVD release I own. The picture is VERY grainy, the blacks are gray and the colors are faded and washed out. It looks like they transferred these from VHS tapes recorded on SLP.

4684724,5,B005FQ2HBO,"Got this set for a Crime Story enthusiast couple and they told everyone it was one of the best gifts ever. Then I got this set for myself since I had never seen the show when it was on TV. That is Del Shannon's voice singing the title song Runaway over the titles and in the entire set, there may be just a few songs which are not by the original artist- but I bet the show never had those few artists on the original soundtrack. It is Roy Orbison's voice. It is Julie London's voice. The cars and costumes are bright. If this transfer is dark then why are the turquoises, pinks and coral colors so vibrant and true to the period? And I am just talking about the cars!  The ladies clothes and hair are true to the period. The men stepped out of the early 1960s, Brylcreem and Vitalis intact. I hesitated getting this set due to some bad reviews on Amazon. Don't know what they were watching. I have the original vinyl and the CDs by many of the soundtrack artists, and this soundtrack is great and real.

I have heard from the superfans that the presentation is not very good (sure, it does look like watching my TV in 1989 even though I have a high Def TV now).  The picture is a little dissapointing and there are no special features really.  Unless you need to have all of the extras, I think this is the way to go.  Great price for a good show.

My favorite actors in this series are Dennis Farina, Ron Dean, Billy Campbell and Andrew Dice Clay. Everyone else is also great at their performances. Tony Denison's portrayal of Ray Luca is so believable, that you'd think he was a real life mobster. He's not though.

4684738,3,B005FQ2HBO,"I held off on ordering The Complete Series for six weeks after it was released in hopes that a chorus of reliable voices would chime in with their thoughts on this latest release. Since that never happened, I thought I'd check it out and give my honest opinion as a fan of the show and somewhat of a nerd about pic+sound quality.

First of all, I can't speak to whether or not Image Entertainment is a bunch of well-intentioned folk who lack the proper tools to do a DVD authoring justice (as I believe Echo Bridge to be) or if they're just willing to cut any corner to increase profit margin but these transfers SUCK! If you're looking for any kind of improvement on previous releases, or if you already own the Anchor Bay editions and are considering ""upgrading,"" don't. The video quality, especially on season 2, looks about as good as a standard-def YouTube video. The audio quality is deplorable as well. Just check out the 2nd line of dialogue in S2, E01, it sounds like it was recorded through a telephone with a slight delay. Kind of like Bob Odenkirk's toe-less kidnapper in Mr. Show. Just awful. If you remember how Twin Peaks: The Complete Series was released on VHS in LP with five episodes crammed onto each tape, this is basically the DVD equivalent.

That said, it's under twenty dollars on Amazon (well under at the moment) and it's basically the only way to buy and watch the series. Unless you want to spend over $120 buying the AB versions, which are of equal quality, I'd have to say I give it a grudging recommendation on the strength of the show alone. But if you're not willing to forgive an abysmal A/V performance for the sake of the story, steer way the eff clear.",1325635200,,1690,4.501628664495114

Both actors play their parts to a tee; Farina as the tough Chicago detective who's out to catch the slick and dangerous mob boss (Denison).  The first season starts in Chicago and it's pretty good but gets intense when Ray Luca moves his mob operation to Vegas; then the show really takes off.  Also you'll recognize alot of stars who were just beginning their careers. The whole mood of the 60's will jump right off your screen.",1324944000,7,588,4.4672897196261685
