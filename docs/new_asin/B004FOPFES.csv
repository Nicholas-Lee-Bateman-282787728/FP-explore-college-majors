4370612,4,B004FOPFES,"An excellent study on the subject of forgiveness.  It really prompted a lot of self examination and led me to develop a class using a few selections from the series.  I can't agree with all the conclusions of the contributors; however, it was fascinating to think about all that was presented, and compare the ideas against my own Christian beliefs.",1377302400,,349,4.8
4370613,4,B004FOPFES,"When I first watched this, I thought, ""How could anyone justify a representation of ""incomplete"" healing, even anger?"".  The film gives honest feedback about how several different people have dealt with terrible things in their lives and stimulates the viewer to take a close, hard look at the way they might improve on dealing with their own forgiveness issues.

Because the film allowed the ugliness of partially complete forgiveness journeys to be shown, it allows the viewer to ""climb the ladder"", understand where THEY may be on the ladder, rather than just stand back and say, ""the mountain is too high - why bother?"".

It does NOT justify a partial journey as the ""right answer"" - it just unblinkingly shows that those ugly ladder steps in the process are out there and may eventually have to be dealt with.

Sure, some may try to use elements of this video to avoid the forgiveness process, or even try to justify their anger & hatred.  Yes, I agree with reviewer ""Brian"" that the ""only way out is to forgive"", but after watching this DVD three full times, I can honestly say that because it does NOT hammer the viewer with "" Thou MUST forgive""...it genuinely leads the viewer towards that very understanding AND helps people remember that forgiveness is a process.  Mistakes can & will be made.  It is NOT just an emotionless YES/NO, forgive/don't forgive, hate/don't hate, angry/don't be angry equation.",1327190400,8,1413,4.8625
4370614,2,B004FOPFES,"The film starts strong but then I started to note a message in the film.  The film has a message that total forgiveness is simply an ideal and not an actual possibility.  Example: They talk about the Amish shooting, and how the Amish forgave... but then bring in person after person who just attacks that level of forgiveness. They also bring in a grief counselor who says ""well it's been a couple years and the families still are grieving..."" and the film's message is -  that their level of forgiveness didn't help them. What the film glosses over is that  when we forgive we  still grieve.  Forgiveness will lesson grief and allows one to transform by cutting the ties that bind the victim to the wrong doer.  Until forgiveness is truly given - people will never get over a situation.

The film just bogs down with Terri (some writer from Yale) who had a harrowing story with a guy who almost killed her.

Terri just bogs the story down with a lack of understanding of what Forgiveness really is.  She tells us towards the end of her long tale, that ""forgiveness stagnated"" her and caused her not to move forward with her life... but Terri NEVER forgave him.  Terri said she went into a state of apathy with her life after the attack.  She fell to fear and apathy - which is understandable... but that's NOT forgiveness.  Terri tells us, that she wakes up at a point in her life and starts this investigation of this guy, which spans her whole life and finally see's that the guy goes to jail for another crime he committed.  Great job.  But she pretends to us that it was her anger that saved her and got her to move on with her life.  But I contend she never got over it.  She's still living it.

All in all I found this film to be a lazy approach to the subject of forgiveness - giving too many reasons to be angry, hateful and resentful.  We need to hear more examples of those that truly have forgiven... not authors who tell us how much anger and resentment have made their lives so wonderful.

If all one did is watch this movie, one might leave feeling justified in their feelings of anger, resentment and hatred.  But if we simply check people who forgive, we can see so many life changing individuals.  Some examples of those who truly forgave:  The Dalai Lama, Martin Luther King Jr., Ghandi, etc.

Another failure of the film is this idea that the Amish forgiveness was only possibly by living in a society that doesn't feel the same as they do.  A guy being interviewed gets upset with the Amish's level of forgiveness on the shooting, and tells that if everyone felt the same way - the killer would have been left to kill more people.  But that's again a classic misunderstanding of forgiveness.

At one point in my life, I studied under a Buddhist monk.  He would often get naysayers who would challenge on him on the point of ahimsa (non-violence) and they would say ""But sometimes we must kill. would you let a man murder hundreds and do nothing???""  He would reply like this:  Do you love you're mother?  Good.  Imagine you came to your mother's home one day... only to find her in a fit of insane rage with a knife - attacking people in the house.  Would your first reaction be: ""Ok i better get the gun and kill her""?  Or would it be ""Let me subdue her, drag her in the street and execute her as a sign to others who may wish to do the same""?  Or rather would you simply subdue her... to use every other non-leathal option before killing her, to stop her?  Obviously you would pick the later.

When we harbor hatered to someone who harmed us, we begin to identify with them.  It causes a binding between them and us.  The only way out, is to forgive.

The film pretends, these people can't possibly exist.  Nor could they possibly be forgiving, except out of some fear based religious belief system.  They back their claim with people who haven't forgiven and feel ""better for it"" and then attack those who have forgiven completely.",1325462400,2,3955,4.436111111111111
4370615,5,B004FOPFES,"I have viewed ""Forgiveness: A Time to Love and a Time to Hate"" several times, and find it one of the most deeply affecting documentaries I have ever seen.

The film explores the spiritual, psychological, and social challenges of forgiveness: are there acts that, by their very nature, are unforgivable? Do we, the living, commit an injustice to the dead when we decide to forgive past evil so that we may move on with our lives? Can forgiveness be afforded too quickly if wrongdoers have not yet fully realized or repented their sins?

These are just a few of the questions that the film raises in a wide variety of circumstances and settings, some of which are widely known (such as the Rwandan genocide), and others of which have faded from the public eye (the murder of five Amish schoolchildren in Nickel Mines, Pennsylvania). ""Forgiveness"" also examines the ""intimate woundings"" of our everyday lives, the quiet transformations that strain, and sometimes break, the bonds of family and friends, woundings which require deep devotion and awareness that forgiveness may be extended.

What is perhaps most extraordinary about this work is that it avoids easy answers and pat formulations. It leaves us with no doubt that there are no absolutes when it comes to forgiveness. Forgiveness is an individual decision, sometimes taken in solitude and sometimes made in a larger religious, social, or political context. It is clearly a process, one that may take an entire lifetime. Whether you are contemplating events on the scale of 9/11 or you are seeking to come to terms with more personal injustices or hurts, this film will give you plenty to consider and, quite possibly, hope to continue your journey.",1323734400,10,1706,4.978947368421053

4370617,3,B004FOPFES,"I was looking for the movie Forgiveness with Arnold Vosloo and I thought that's what I had purchased. The description of the one with Mr. Vosloo is identical to this in description and packaging, however he was never in it. I watched the entire thing even the bonus features, scenes ,etc just in case I missed it but I hadn't. This documentary is very well done about the powere, negative and positive, of forgiveness but since it wasn't what I was looking for I wasn't thrilled watching it.",1316908800,,491,4.590909090909091

8428120,1,B004FOPFES,"The feature story in this documentary was not going to help someone face forgiveness effectively. The producers do not include evidence-based research instead relying on this anecdote as their premise fot not forgiving. I liked 'The Power of Forgiveness"" more than this documentary. This one is not worth your valuable time unless you want reasons to hold a grudge.",1495065600,,365,5.203389830508475
8428121,5,B004FOPFES,"A Deep-rooted documentary. Faces things that most Can't or Won't face.
Contemplates 'forgiving the unforgivable'. As they say in 12-step - 'Forgiveness Isn't for the other person'.
Not easily 'said' and gut wrenching to Do. All all the atrocities this film faces - the one that upsets me the Most - is a
kooky woman - who walked away from her kids and husband - and now is semi-baffled as to Why the kids were devastated.
Sometimes - the most intellectual people - are the Most screwed up.
This film shows overviews of what people have endured and forgiven (or tried to forgive)
Sometimes - forgiveness is an ongoing work in progress. Anyways - parts of this are Difficult and Unsettling to watch -
but then again - it Wouldn't be a Great documentary if it didn't.
Forgiveness is about Facing and Identifying Pain - Expressing it - and letting it go.
This DVD is One disc - with 2 parts - probably about a total of 3 hours. And some bonus things too.
I think I get these lessons & concepts - but practicing it - it's probably a skill or art-form I might not have.
Powerful documentary!! Scott M.",1490054400,,1095,4.45273631840796
