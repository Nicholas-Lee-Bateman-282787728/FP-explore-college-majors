8705644,2,B00UGPHXOU,"Same crappy DVD as the $4.99 version. it is NOT anamorphic widescreen, meaning it will have bars on all 4 sides of the movie. There needs to be an updated version of this movie released on Blu-ray. I would recommend this for $5 but not $15/$20.",1524873600,,244,4.326086956521739

8705650,5,B00UGPHXOU,"With all the bad movies in the world today, it is hard to weed out all the trash and find a good show. Especially when all the funny ones come with bad language and inappropriate scenes. But there is no need for anyone to search anymore, because the movie What About Bob is the best comedy you will ever find and is not inappropriate.
In fact, What About Bob is a Im laughing so hard I can't breathe type movie. It is full of big laughs and can be appreciated by anyone with even the tiniest speck of good humor. Dont get me wrong, like any movie it has its ups and downs, but the not-so-great-parts are drowned out by the amazing witty parts. It is very far from the so called funny movies with lame jokes and stupid actors. Though this movie does have some light profanity, it is a hundred times cleaner than tons of other movies. When you watch this movie, you never get the well known embarrassed feeling for the actors or yourself, and it never leaves you with an ugly feeling afterward. In fact, it was nominated for the MTV movie award because it was a best comedic performance.
This good laugh all starts when a man named Dr. Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss) gets a new patient named Bob Wiley (Bill Murray). This man is over his head in insane phobias and just cant get a grip. He loves Dr. Leos new therapy book called Baby Steps and really finds the help he needs in it. But when his new doctor decides to take a month vacation, Bob panics and follows him there so he can keep discussing his issues.
Once he is there, Leo tries to get him to leave so he can enjoy his vacation and get ready for his interview with Good Morning America. However, Bob doesnt want to go away and keeps finding reasons to stay. After much frustration, Leo hits his breaking point. And you would not believe what he does.
This movie is perfect at showing good comedy, and the actors are so good you forget it isn't real. Once you fall into the scenes you don't come out until the jaw dropping ending. This movie is drop-to-the-floor-laughing good and should be watched by everyone who can appreciate it for its brilliance.",1487894400,2,2108,4.366412213740458
