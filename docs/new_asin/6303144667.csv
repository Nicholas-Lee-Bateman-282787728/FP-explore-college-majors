571350,5,6303144667,"The Lorax by Dr. Seuss is one of the best books I have ever read. Never mind that it is somewhat a childrens book.  The story deals with environmental issues, ethical dilemmas and just plain ""do unto others..."" philisophy.  I read it to my son when he was five (he's now 15) and still I rate it as one of my favorites - for any age!  END",882403200,,337,4.0
7839008,4,6303144667,"The last reviewer's interpretation of the book involves a narrow understanding of profit motive as ""greed"" and no understanding of property rights.  (The same is a problem for the environmental movement today.) ... Someone truly driven by profit (Once-ler) motive would not cut down all of his Truffula trees, but rather would replant and manage his truffula forests in order to continue his biggering (growth) into the future.  At the same time, habitat for the forest creatures is continuously renewed (dispelling this apparent dichotomy).  In the Lorax, there are no clearly assigned property rights.  Thus, the Once-ler's has no incentive to protect his own property.  Indeed, since no one owns the surrounding property either, the Once-ler is also allowed to pollute, as well.  They have no recourse to sue him or exact compensation, so the Once-ler is allowed to spread the cost of his activities onto everyone else.  This is known by economists and social theorists as the Tragedy of the Commons...  The lesson I'll teach my kids from this book is respect for other's property, for nature, and that ""common property"" ends in disaster.",1080864000,6,1141,5.129729729729729
7839009,5,6303144667,"I was at a choir party the other day, and we were writing evaluations.  The daughter of the director pulled out books that we could write on.  The Lorax turned up!  We asked the super-capitalist if he'd ever read it.  Nope.  We joked that we figured as much.  He asked what the book was about.  We replied:
""It's a book about the pitfalls of capitalism, the greed of the wealthy, the ridiculousness of marketing, the importance of the environment, the disregard of big companies, standing up for yourself, and being the one to make a difference.""
""All that in a Dr. Seuss book?!""
""Absolutely""
I've sworn that my kids will be raised on this book.  I think it made an imprint on me while I was young, and has affected me greatly ever since.
Cheers!",1020038400,13,746,4.474074074074074
7839010,5,6303144667,If Pat McCulloch or anyone else can help us get hold of a copy of the video that would be great. I have used the book in teaching my economics class but I would love to be able to show the video,982627200,,194,3.642857142857143
7839011,5,6303144667,"As fabulous as Dr. Seuss has always been, the story of the Lorax is the ultimate as far as I'm concerned in teaching our children the value of the environment and the threat that capitalist consumerism is to the beauty of the Earth that we love.  When we look at some of the damage that grows exponentially through exploitation for profit all around us, the Lorax teaches us to be brave enough to take a stand, even if it is a frustrating, lonely one.  I admire the Lorax.  He speaks for the trees!",970704000,20,498,4.333333333333333
7839012,5,6303144667,"The schools resource centre where I work owns an ancient copy of the Lorax (VHS PAL for Australia) and it is almost loved to death. It is used for fun, as well as units on the environment, greed, selfishness and the stupid  side of capitalism. Where can we get another copy? If we find a source, it  will be flooded with orders because I will spread the word to those outside  our area who would love to get their hands on any copy, even ours.",963273600,3,443,4.188235294117647
7839013,5,6303144667,"I watched this video for the first time when I was about 10.  I know I wasn't the target audience for the movie, but I loved it!  For one thing, all the songs and rhymes are really catchy, and the acting is great.  On a  deeper level though, it is really a haunting story, especially when you  have to watch all the animals leaving because they were forced out of their  home.  Read the book, then be sure to watch the movie!",952387200,9,425,4.109756097560975

While I concentrate this study to coordinate with Earth Day activities, it could be used at any  level when an awareness of the environment is needed.",942364800,9,271,4.625
7839015,5,6303144667,"My son is not even 4 yet and he loves this video.  I find him singing the songs and saying ""I speak for the trees"" often after watching it.  I think the environmental and capitalistic messages are revealed to kids  in a manner that won't scare them, but still enlightens them to new  concepts.  I watched this when I was a kid and it is still good!",934070400,,348,4.134328358208955
