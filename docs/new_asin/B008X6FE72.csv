8531606,2,B008X6FE72,"This video is not for a person that dose not know about there Cannon T4i, or has just purchased there first DLSR camera.
The instructor spoke to the end user with alot of jargon that one most have went to a photography/film school to understand.
Which if that was the case they would have no problem reading the owners manual and would have no need for a video.

it was not clear and concise. I wanted to learn more about the camera menu functions as it pertains to the REAL WORLD
and taken great shots for modeling. Instead this dvd left one confused and wanting more. The footage of the dvd looked great
and there return policy was great, but there no where near on the same level as other instructors like Lynda.com or macprovideo.com and so forth.",1364428800,2,751,4.442028985507246
8531607,4,B008X6FE72,"This DVD is definitely more informative and easier to understand than the supplied manual, both print and cd.  It is worth the money in time saved in learning to operate the camera, especially if you are accustomed to film SLR cameras, and have limited experience with digital photography (which I am).  I especially appreciate the expanded capability which digital image stabilization (reduction of camera shake) gives with hand-held use, like photographing insects and other small subjects which move around.",1363824000,,510,5.443037974683544
