8556434,5,B00AQJCN5U,The videos were clear and the sound was good.  The tutorials were very instrumental in helping me get an A in Gen Chem 1.  Not much help for Chem 2 though.,1505520000,,155,3.967741935483871
8556435,5,B00AQJCN5U,"Jason Gibson is a genius!! I ordered all of his chemistry, his calculus and all of his physics!! So far I have just completed the chemistry and I have such a greater understanding because of this man.  He breaks everything down to such a simple easy to understand format. Please, Jason Gibson, come out with an organic chemistry tutor DVD set!!",1423008000,,344,4.639344262295082
8556436,5,B00AQJCN5U,I used this before my first Gen Chem class. Very helpful and prepared me for success in the course! Def recommend this for review and help with applying to assigned coursework.,1401926400,,176,4.709677419354839
8556437,5,B00AQJCN5U,"This is the last volume in Jason's Chemistry series, which is designed to cover chemistry 1.  If you are taking introduction to chemistry (or non AP high school chemistry)what you get in the 4 volumes will cover pretty much the entire class.  If you are taking the General Chemistry class (or AP chemistry in high school) you will get about 70-75 percent of what you will get in the first semester.  The parts that Jason omitted are the ideal gas laws, and thermochemistry.

This particular set of DVDs covers redox (oxidation, reduction) reactions.  As is Jason's style in all of his DVDs, he only presumes you have the knowledge of the material that proceeds what you are working on.  In this case you need to be very familiar with net ionic equations and Stoichiometry.  Aside from that he presumes you are an absolute beginner with redox reactions and walks you through step-by-step, explaining everything he is doing along the way to drill the material into your head. You honestly end up doing so many examples that you have no choice but to learn the process for balancing the reactions.

The best part of the set in my opinion is how he explains doing the problems that require you to balance reactions taking place in a basic solution.  His method is a workaround to the method that many books teach, that builds on the process for balancing reactions in an acidic solution by tacking on three additional steps at the end.  Many books teach an alternate step in the middle of the process that then requires you to do a lot more work to get everything to balance.  You will want to get an idea for what method your teacher wants you to use, but most of the time if you get the right answer, they will not care how you got to it, as long as you show your work.

I have used Jason's material as the foundation for my preparation to get me through all levels of calculus and the first year of physics.  Even though you have to pay for the DVDs as opposed to finding the material for free online, I believe that the quality of the material and Jason's teaching style is that good.  If you are a visual learner and do not need the interaction you would get with a regular tutor, and want something that will get you a jump on the material or clarify what you did not understand in lecture, then these DVDs are the best investment you can make.",1372636800,,2346,4.450934579439252
8556438,5,B00AQJCN5U,"I got these dvds for my husband, who is going to nursing school.  He watched these before his chemistry class, and he said it made a huge difference.  Jason Gibson makes everything easy to understand, and is not at all boring.  Get these for any class that you need to take - you won't regret it.",1371600000,3,296,4.25
8556439,5,B00AQJCN5U,"Jason Gibson products will help you towards getting that A+. I have purchase mostly all of his products from Algebra, Statistics and now Chemistry. I received an 'A'in Algebra and Statistics just by taken notes from off his DVDs in addition to following the lectures and instruction of my professors. Not only that it also help my colleagues to master a good grade in their course. Yes, I have recommended this product to my colleagues and his material has help them to succeed in their course of endeavor. Hope this review helps",1369612800,,529,4.760869565217392
8556440,5,B00AQJCN5U,"No Chemistry Background Required.
Excellent Instructor.
He Explains In Plain English.
Highly recomnended
I Will Buy More Products Of his.",1368316800,,137,5.9
