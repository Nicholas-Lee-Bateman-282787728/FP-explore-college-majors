885317,5,6304479859,"This movie was totally different for Elvis.  Instead of warding off the flocks of girls and singing on the beach he was just trying to have a roof over his head!  I loved the fact that he played this role beautifully.  So endearing and naive but at the sane time so beleivable.  The move was great and hilarious.  One of his greatest acting jobs.  If you didn;t like Elvis before, when this movie was over you couldn't help but love him afterward.",988675200,13,447,4.390243902439025
885318,4,6304479859,"Some of Elvis' newer initiates might be surprised to learn that one of his  best movies had but five songs and was not in the Hollywood Musical mold -  it's a completely different character for Elvis, a simple drifter in a  family of drifters, upsetting local political hacks by homesteading on  valuable, undeveloped Florida land and eventually turning it into a  successful fishing area. The theme song has become a Rock and Roll Classic.  The opening number, ""What A Wonderful Life"", is another uptempo  gem featuring fortisimo Presley.",962582400,12,539,5.056818181818182
885319,4,6304479859,A very underrated Elvis film.  Elvis is a natural in this story of homesteading in Florida - some of the lines are real beauties.  Great locations too!

885321,5,6304479859,"The movie was filmed in the Yankeetown area of western Florida. Tons of white sand were trucked in to create a lovely beach which remains mostly unchanged to this day. Interiors were filmed at Inverness Court House and  Crystal River High School and Ocala. A very entertaining, funny film.  Presleys acting may have been his best before the Girl epics began. The  house the Kwimpers lived in was donated to the Florida Sheriffs Youth Ranch  in Live Oak, Florida, which can be viewed to this day. .",932601600,25,497,4.67816091954023

885358,4,6304479859,"The American dream of owning ones own land and from overwhelming laws and rules can be inciting. In practice it can unleash dangerous conflicts, unless you are too dense to be effected by them.

The Kwimper family travailing through Florida runs out of gasoline. After a conflict with local authorities it is found out that you can homestead the unincorporated area as so they do. A friendly gambling group finds out about this loophole and also moves in. Conflict of interests forces Toby to take on the duties of sheriff. He is still friendly and even returns a mysterious ticking package to them. Other scenes involve social workers trying to remove adopted children (you may want to watch [Improper Channels (1981)] that has a similar theme).

You will have lots of fun watching the details and cringing at some of the action. And pay close attention to the word association used in the trial.",1502928000,,897,4.818181818181818

They come across a road block and sign that is saying, ""positively closed to the public""., but since Pop believes since they get government checks, he feels he is not the ""public"", so he drives around the block and drives on the road anyway. As time flies by, Anne notices they have not passed any gas stations nor any houses for miles. Just then, the car runs out of gas and it stops next to this small sand beach next to a river. Pop considers it private property and so there they will stay.

885842,5,6304479859,This was one of the more entertaining Elvis movies. The songs were catchy and the story kept my interest. Elvis seems very relaxed in this setting and does a great comedic job while being serious. This is one of the few films he made where he really had to play a character very different from his own personality. The Kwimper common sense cuts through all the rhetoric of modern society to get to the truth and its a scream to see how jaded we have become. The TV program Matlock had Andy Griffith playing a seemingly country bumpkin who nails the legal question just when things seem lost. I wonder if the character was a seed planted by this movie?,1406246400,2,651,4.433333333333334

885881,4,6304479859,"Elvis Presley films are unfortunately dissed by too many; this breezy charmer features Elvis in a Jethro Bodine (Beverly Hillbillies) kind of role.  Southern, honest, not terribly clever.  Presley is superb in the understated role and handles several amusing one liners with skill.  About a family group of homesteaders, Presley is charming and has at least three good songs.

The direction of the film is laid back and very even paced, but that steadiness may seem to those who watch contemporary films as being somewhat lifeless and lacking emotional depth.  This comedy features Howard McNear (Floyd The Barber from Andy Griffith) as a bank lender.  McNear is hilarious and ads to the chuckles.

As others have noted, the video transfer is weak, but still watchable.  The cinematography doesn' take advantage of Florida's beauty as well as it could have.",1393113600,,857,5.115107913669065

885883,4,6304479859,"I agree with other reviewers that Elvis can act if given a chance.  He did a great job in this movie, even though it was kind of cheesy.  I really liked his genuine southern accent, which he hasn't been able to use in most of his movies (I am originally from the South, and I can tell when an accent is genuine:)
The only thing that I didn't really like was several of the songs that he sang were obviously done offsite.  There was huge orchestration. which one little ol' guitar can not make, plus Elvis delivering an echoing rendition.  I would prefer he just sing without all the extras.
I like it when Elvis is allowed to act; I'm not sure what Colonel Parker's motives were, but Elvis should have been allowed to ACT, not just put out movie after movie without substance.  He did a good job in Flaming Star, too, but I enjoyed this one a little more.",1391385600,3,855,4.285714285714286

886037,5,6304479859,"This is a cute movie. Actually in 2013 seems like a fantasy. Land in Florida undeveloped? But this party of 5 find it by accident and get to claim it. Elvis has two beautiful songs in it - Follow that Dream which is dreamy to watch him singing it laying in the sand. And ""Angel"" - if anyone can sing that pretty you better get yourself on stage - you are destined for a good future.  The father -played by Arthur McConnell, who also was Jimmy Stewart's law side kick in Anatomy of a Murder - is perfect in this role - explaining how he tries to help the govt out with everything it wants to do. lol
Anne Helm, the sister type girl in the movie - is fine and not at all silly like other Elvis costars to come. The movie is a mood lifter, an easy time with great color scenery is excellent. Elvis plays honest but adorable. easy to get along with hard to push around and slick without knowing it.
But when he sings 'Angel' - who's fooling who. Nice Elvis movie. Proud to have it. Funny and silly. I am a Love Me Tender Jailhouse Rock  King Creole Flaming Star type of Elvis movie fan (ok I have Change of Habit).",1363996800,6,1110,4.110599078341014

I bought the movie because I was recently in Yankeetown Florida, and drove on the ""Follow That Dream"" highway, so named because this is where the bridge and sandy beach scenes were shot.  The bridge is still there, but the sand is long since gone.  Was never there, naturally anyway, as this part of Florida is without beaches - just marsh and wetlands.....

Still it was a fun movie, and recommended to Elvis fans, although I am probably the only Elvis fan to have not watched this early 60's film.",1363996800,2,651,4.428571428571429

He's not into chasing after women in this one, accidentally robs a bank (with ""Floyd the barber"" as his hostage), sings only a handful of short songs (all of them catchy) plus has his only courtroom scene in any of his films, which is great! His supporting characters are awesome, too, which is a relief, what with the usual ones he's stuck with. The only reason I don't give this a perfect score is the 40 minute padding of the movie with a meandering casino gangster sub-plot.

886100,5,6304479859,"In ""Follow that Dream"", Elvis stands out as a somewhat simple-minded, somewhat naive, but incredibly honest GI who was retired on disability. Arthur O'Connell is hilarious as his father, who likes to help out the government as much as possible by taking all the money they will offer him.

Along with the father and son are a variety of foundlings that the father took in over the years. On a trip through Florida, they run out of gas and homestead a stretch of beach. A local banker who likes the fishing loans them the money to set up a fishing operation off of their beach, while at the same time a trailer load of gambling gangsters set up shop when they discover that the unincorporated area is a little hole in local law enforcement. A local social worker inserts herself into the picture in an attempt to help shoehorn the family off of their homestead, and makes a play to take the orphans away.

Elvis provides great straight-man comedy throughout, constantly misunderstanding situations from the commonplace to the abnormal as he tries to fit them into his narrow experience in the world around him. His adopted sister, Holly, who has less experience but more capacity to catch on to events around her, helps to keep the family from falling face first into the pitfalls placed in their path. Arthur O'Connell constantly expounds ""sage"" advice of a decidedly shaky nature, all of which is amusing.

Filmed on location on or near the Gulf Coast in central Florida, the scenery is beautiful. Of course, as an Elvis movie, there are several songs. All are entertaining, and the title song, ""Follow that Dream"", is a real winner.

If you've never seen Follow that Dream, you owe yourself the experience of this very entertaining film. If you haven't seen it for a while, you may not remember how much you liked it in the first place!

886122,5,6304479859,"Follow that Dream is Elvis at his best. A comparatively early musical effort before the King settled into his more formulaic series of musicals. The movie has Elvis as an 'aw shucks, maam' good ole' southern boy. On outside appearances - not too bright but underneath a tough core with a country smart take on things. Elvis is excellent and his screen presence shows why his movies were far more profitable than such mainstream musicals as 'Camelot' and 'Paint Your Wagon'. Elvis wandering the woods singing 'I Talk to the Trees' would have been an enjoyable, silly pleasure and not the toe curling embarassment that Clint Eastwood made of it in the latter film. Obviously Eastwood has transcended all expectations since then but in musical adventure films no one can surpass the King. Apart from the opening song there are no outstanding musical numbers but the ensemble cast works well with Arthur O'Connell particularly noticeable as the canny patriach and Anne Helm enticing as the romantic interest (both starred in other Elvis movies also). The story moves along well with a nice twist at the end. Great nostalgic movie for a time that probably never existed but should have.",1193270400,5,1181,4.939698492462312

It has many funny scenes and lines, and shows Elvis's natural flair for comedy that was seldom utilized in his movies. Sometimes this film is criticized for portraying the central characters as sterotyped southern bumpkins, yet I believe this is negated by the fact that they outsmart all their enemies to triumph in the end. And it's all done with playful humor anyway.

All the cast is good, with standouts being Elvis, Arthur O'Connell as Elvis's amusingly daffy father, and Simon Oakland as the mafioso that is outsmarted at every move. The few songs are decent, though none is terrific, and mostly contribute to the film; the title song and ""Angel"" are the best of these.

886269,5,6304479859,"Every so often, an actor plays a role that fits like their own skin, a perfect match between character and performer.  George C. Scott as Patton.  Judy Garland as Dorothy Gale.  Bela Lugosi as Dracula.  Clark Gable as Rhett Butler.  Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade.  Madonna as Evita. Charles Laughton as Captain Bligh. Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, just to name a few.

To that list, I add Elvis Presley as Toby Kwimper.

Yes, I know; as an actor Elvis was pretty much a good singer and an okay dancer.  Most of his movie performances are ho-hum, looking back on them decades later.  However, in the case of Follow That Dream the persona of Toby Kwimper, a young man of whom one of the other characters observes, ""His heart is pure and his head is empty and you can't beat that combination,"" is brilliantly portrayed by Elvis, one of the few genuinely good-hearted actors ever to hit Hollywood.

Toby Kwimper, an innocent from the swamplands of New Jersey's Pine Barrens, has to deal with all kinds of dangers of modern life that would cause a less optimistic and lucky hero to quail.  The plot is fairly simple.

On a trip to Florida to visit relatives, Toby, his Pop (ably played by Arthur O'Connell), his twin kid brothers Teddy and Eddy, his baby sister Ariadne and Holly (Anne Helm), a babysitter who is no kin to him, run out of gas on a state highway not yet open to traffic that Pop had driven down.  Stranded on a coast road, the family group improvises, adapts and overcomes to set up camp with no real equipment by the road on dredge spoil used to fill in the land so the road could be made.  The 'pioneers' are truly on virgin land; it didn't exist a couple of months before and the State did not bother to title it.

After a few days of roughing it, feeding themselves and quite well at that on nature's bounty, Civilization and Authority show up in the form of H. Arthur King, the local Highway Superintendent.  He goes bananas at the sight of (to his eyes) a bunch of bums camping beside his newly made highway, climbs on his bureaucratic high horse and orders them out. Pop, however, an expert at dealing with governmental bureaucrats after years spent on various programs like welfare, AFDC, WIC and many others, climbs on his own high horse and refuses to leave, citing an 1820 law about homesteading.  He swears out a statement describing the land parcel, and the family settles in to prove up their land.

Not one to give up easily, King sics the local child welfare supervisor and clinical psychologist, Alicia Claypoole, onto the Kwimpers.  The idea is to prove that Pop and Toby aren't fit to raise the kids, threaten them with the removal of the children, and thus force the Kwimpers to flee.  Coincidentally, Alicia has the idea of having Toby jump her bones - except that Toby is so innocently naive he can't tell a pass from a hand-off (although Holly, who has her own cap set for Toby, certainly can).  Toby's bewilderment at Alicia's advances will have consequences later.

Toby himself has adventures in the Innocents Abroad vein.  When Holly comes up with the idea of starting a little fishing business, a trip to town by Toby to apply for a small business loan ends up with his being mistaken for a bank robber, with humorous results.  When Alicia tries to subvert the Kwimpers' homesteading by showing Toby how much easier life would be in government housing, he ends up recruiting a retired couple to move out to the Kwimpers' highway bridge and homestead the virign land on the other side of the highway.  And when two gangsters (Simon Oakland and Jack Kruschen) set up next door to the Kwimpers because the land isn't policed by the county or the state - more of King's handiwork - Toby serves as proof that God watches out for children, drunks and fools when by a series of misadventures and just being neighborly he demolishes their casino, wrecks their dock, bankrupts their operation and runs them out of town.

The climax of the picture comes when Alicia Claypoole has the twins and Ariadne taken away from Pop on specious psychological grounds, forcing a confrontation in front of a judge who has the power to make the removal permanent.  Once more, it's up to Toby to make things right - if he can.

Follow That Dream is taken from Richard Powell's book, Pioneer, Go Home! and thanks to screenwriter Charles Lederer astutely deciding not to monkey with a well-crafted book, hews very closely to the novel.  He also manages to keep the feel of Toby and Pop's speech patterns and most of the book's original dialogue.  Lederer cut only two sequences from the novel.  The first was the hurricane which H. Arthur King hoped to use as a pretext to break the Kwimpers' continuous occupancy of their land as required by the homesteading act, and it is not missed.  The second is the epilogue, and that isn't missed either.  Frankly, he did one of the best jobs of adapting a book to the screen that I have ever seen; and considering the vivisection usually performed on original novels in Hollywood, that is praise indeed.

The five songs Elvis sings are nothing special, but that doesn't matter.  In my opinion, this is the one Elvis Presley movie that could stand on its own even if he didn't sing a note.  Nobody is going to mistake Follow That Dream for anything but light entertainment; but entertained you will be, and delightfully so.  As I said, this is the role Elvis Presley was born to play, and he plays it to perfection.",1098835200,72,5470,4.595262615859938

886271,5,6304479859,"There are only three Elvis films that I enjoy: King Creole, Jailhouse Rock, and Follow That Dream.  While the first two are great musical dramas from when Elvis still had the air of rebellion about him, Follow That Dream is a piece of comedic fluff like most of his later films, but one which avoids being as formulaic or sickly sweet or filled with terrible music as are most of those later films.
In this one Elvis plays a true innocent who is somehow still ignorant about the ways of the world despite being a vet.  He and his family (including some orphans they are looking after) build a homestead on government land which happens to be prime real estate and find themselves in the position to legally obtain ownership of this land.  As a result they become the targets of organized crime and feds (who can tell them apart?) who want the land.  Elvis also finds himself the target of a crackpot social worker looking into the welfare of the orphans who seeks revenge after he innocently spurns her advances.  Elvis gives a really fun performance as a naive character who is so positive in his outlook that when somebody shoots at him he automatically assumes it was an error.
The film pokes great fun at bureaucracy and greed, but it maintains the optimistic outlook that good guys will win in the end.  Such an innocent perspective tends to turn off many fans of social satire who find such things too escapist, but what most cynical viewers miss is that much of the innocence is tongue in cheek, and I personally see nothing wrong with optimism so long as it doesn't interfere with realism.

It might have been the heat since it was done in the summer in Florida and temperatures went above 100. Elvis had to change his shirt constantly in one day. My mama loves this one. She's the one who started me off with my admiration of Elvis and everything about him. Now I'm a bigger Evis fan at the age of 15. This is something Elvis fans have to see at least once.
