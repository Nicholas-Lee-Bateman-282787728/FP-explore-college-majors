525457,5,6302980437,This was a super documentary about a time and place that is no more. In some ways I think we have gone backwards.,1373328000,,113,3.9565217391304346
525458,3,6302980437,Interviewees were well-spoken.  They needed more depth interviews.  Interesting history of founding of Maud's.  Would have liked to have seen more couples.,1359244800,,155,5.954545454545454

525460,4,6302980437,"The film deals with the last day Maud's is open after being in business for 23 years. I enjoyed seeing the various patrons reminisce about their younger days at Maud's, but I wish more detail could have gone into the history behind lesbian bars, their huge impact during the repressive 1940s and 1950s, and how brave these women were to defy authority and risk arrest by patronizing these places. I would have liked this documentary to be longer, with the regulars going into more detail about how the bars affected their lives, problems they encountered, etc. It seemed people were sad but accepting about Maud's closing, indicating that social changes dictated its eventual demise.",1314316800,3,683,5.0
525461,5,6302980437,"I was totally disturbed when I saw the lesbian club scene in the film ""Black Dahlia.""  There, a lesbian club is shown as huge with many lights and everyone having a good time.  Every gay studies text said that being in a gay or lesbian club in the mid-20th century could have gotten you arrested, fired, and worse.  Clubs were often holes in the wall because they didn't want to be noticed by others or were run by the mafia.  Lesbian bar frequenters at that time were brave women taking risks.  This documentary points to the realities of a lesbian club over the decades.

One interviewee said that at one time, there was only one lesbian bar in SF compared to 139 places for gay men.  Many films now have lesboeroticism in that, but the number of lesbian documentaries is still small.  This was a needed and appreciated intervention.

Many a documentary on gay men never mentions lesbians, but this work on lesbians did mention gay men.  The work says that as gay men were fighting HIV, many lesbians began abandoning alcohol and leading healthier lives.  This work spoke about the racism in gay male spots were men of color were often discouraged from being present.  I salute the work's inclusiveness.

The work did address alcoholism among lesbians.  They mentioned having a softball team, but I never understood who were their rivals.  They presented as the only game in town.  So who played against them?

The work includes interviews from Del Martin and Phyllis Lyons, two big heroines of mine.  Del said something very poignant:  ""The only constant is change.""  I would be loathe to bring up the term ""social construction"" here, but the bar employees and patrons seemed to realize that things were changing and they welcomed it, or weren't upset that their day or scene was finishing.

The work presents San Francisco as a Gay Mecca, a Hippie Mecca, a progressive Mecca, etc.  In the few years I lived in the Bay Area, I hated it with a capital (sp?) H.  For people who did not enjoy that city, it may be hard to watch a documentary which praises it and shows beautiful photos from it.",1203811200,5,2094,4.630434782608695

525519,5,6302980437,This movie provided insight on a part of San Francisco lesbian culture with which I was unfamiliar. It was interesting to hear the women's personal stories in the context of the larger history of our civil rights movement.,1403654400,,222,4.868421052631579

7832715,4,6302980437,"Very warm and intimate look at lesbian life during a transformational period in LGBTQ history. I loved hearing about how each of the women profiled came to discover Maud's and found it heartwarming to see how they found a welcoming community and formed lifelong relationships. We have gained so much since that time but it is a little sad that we don't have the same sense of community that Maud's created. Thank you for this documentary, it is an important piece of history!",1467676800,,475,4.734939759036145
