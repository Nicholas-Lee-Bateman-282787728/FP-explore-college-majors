8172465,2,B000A7DVS6,"First of all, fans of Vincent Price should be aware that he is not in ""Chamber of Horrors""--nor are Richard Long or Carolyn Craig for that matter.  Nor was the film produced in 1958--from the look of it, probably early to mid 1930's.  The film is a fairly tedious bit of melodrama.  The transfer is awful--fuzzy picture and the sound is so bad the dialogue is hard to make out.  ""Bluebeard"" is the better of the two with John Carradine's restrained performance the reason for giving the dvd two stars.  The picture isn't terrible clear, but the sound is okay.  So, for five dollars I would give this one a look if you like John Carradine, but skip over ""Chamber of Horrors"".",1131235200,5,674,4.483606557377049
