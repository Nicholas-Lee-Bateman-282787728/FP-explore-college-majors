8715196,5,B00X6RJ17C,"A wonderful documentary! Containing the 1:36:00 film, plus a whole ton of great bonus features. Going into the history, it talks about the early days when the Mekons would hang out with the Gang Of Four, and sneak into their studio space to practice on their equipment when the band was down at the pub. Scenes of left-wing Leeds, meeting the young U2 as an opening act (the Mekons were headlining). Begs the question ""how do you have an amateur band as a career?"" Jumping to Ancient & Modern writing sessions, showing the progression from studio to stage. Violence at benefit gigs. Meeting Bill Leader, ethno-musicologist, who understood that they were English country singers. Leader had produced English Country music on Topic Records. Mis-playing got embedded into their music, which was a-tonal and dis-harmonic. Came into folk music, which opened new horizons, and produced English Dancing Master. BBC coverage of the miners strike. ""Fought a dawn battle"", with police dogs. Tales of Dick Taylor, Susie Honeyman, and Steve Goulding (a proper drummer) and Lu Edmonds, joining for the miner's benefit, and then never really leaving. There are nice interviews with the various ex-Mekons, with Chicago DJ (and country influence) Terry Nelson, and Bloodshot Records. The influence of the Sundowners is explored. There's a wonderful story about the runes on the Curse Of The Mekons album cover. Lu talks Tajikistan, and we learn that he lives in London and Kyzyl, Siberio. Ed Roche of Touch & Go Records talks Lu as well. Jon Langford is underplayed, although his little dance for ""Cockermouth"" is probably the funniest thing in the show. ""Jon's music repels all the right people,"" says Tony Fitzpatrick. ""I don't know where he gets the energy."" Scene of the Burlington Welsh Choir, and Sally & the Goats with Fred Armisen. ""There's a lot of available partners in Chicago,"" apparently. ""Mekons vanity plates people. Luc Sante sounds like Miguel Farrer. Mekons United show. Kathy Acker, Vito Acconci about the Pussy and the Pirates production. It's a loving production with all the right parts and I'm so glad it's mine

Many bonus features, starting with ""Live at the Bell House"" (33:00), a corkin' live show, with a blistering version of ""Diamonds"" from Natural, where all sing."" ""Geeshie"" includes a Sally Timms vamp. Tom on pianica. ""Okay,  here's enough of that old hsti."" Obscure hits! Fletcher Christian!! The ""Mekons Symposium"" (38:23), held at Columbia University on October 20th 2014 for the film launch is a bit of a snoozefest, where each panellist gives a little speech, and at the end a panellist asks a few questions for the gang. Only one Mekon onstage (Jon, of course), but there's also Vito Acconci, Jonathan Franzen, Mary Harron, Greil Marcus and Luc Sante. Franzen reads lyrics, Harron, Marcus & Sante read stuff that they've written about the Mekons, and Acconci describes the Pussy production (and it's the best part of the whole thing), although Marcus' discussion of ""Kill them"" bumper stickers is wry and apt. Langford sings a song. The ""Is punk still relevant"" (0:50) anecdote is interesting, but it's nice that it's short. Ditto for ""MekonsWatch"" by Mark Kemp, where he mentions a magazine column about the Mekons. ""Rico's Art Studio"" (3:45) is great, because you get to see him at work, talking about forgeries. ""For the Mekons et all"" (4:58) is a nice Will Oldham song, and ""Jon hits the links"" (1:09) is a bizarre game thing. There are also 12 old concert posters.",1521590400,,3493,5.010327022375215
8715197,5,B00X6RJ17C,"This is an excellent documentary on the funnest, greatest band on the planet.  Just a heads up, Fred Armisen is high on the credits but he's only in a small portion of the movie.  Which is really no big deal because almost all the Mekons are very engaging characters.",1474848000,,267,4.428571428571429
8715198,4,B00X6RJ17C,"The Mekons have been one of my favorite bands since I discovered them in 1998.  I have never had the good fortune to live anywhere they have toured, so I have never seen them live, but I have followed them for going on two decades now, and they are still making great music, releasing a new album every few years.

This documentary is very good on the beginning and early years of the Mekons.  It gives a good sense of the left-wing culture of Leeds where the band began as art students, along with fellow political punks the Gang of Four.  Incredibly, they landed a record contract before the Gang of Four and toured extensively, despite not knowing how to play their instruments and not writing recognizably pop songs.  In the tense political atmosphere of Britain in the late Seventies, the Mekons played lots of benefits for Rock Against Racism and other causes, and violence increasingly broke out at their concerts, leading them to stop playing in the early Eighties for several years, something I did not know until watching this film.  I was also unfamiliar with many early band members -- Kevin Lycett and Andy Corrigan, for instance, are featured in interviews.  There are also lots of interviews with music critics, which is fine but overdone relative to hearing from current Mekons.

They didn't break up, and absorbed lots of folk music influence while out of the public eye.  They reemerged to support the miners' strike in 1984, and were joined by the excellent drummer Steve Goulding, who had played with Elvis Costello, and multi-instrumentalist Lu Edmonds of the Damned, which marked a turning point toward their being a competent band.  During the mid-Eighties they discovered American country music, and ""studied"" with the Sundowners in Chicago, producing the legendary, twisted&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fear-and-Whiskey-1985/dp/B008EEB8IW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fear and Whiskey (1985)</a>&nbsp;and two more albums in that countrified vein.

At that point, the newly revitalized Mekons signed with A&M records and released the great&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mekons-Rock-n-Roll-1989/dp/B00C3V570C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mekons Rock 'n' Roll (1989)</a>.  The film focuses on the subsequent dropping of the band by the label, and their failure to achieve commercial success, which is no doubt an important part of the story.  However, there is little time spent on the music made since then, which in my opinion is the band's best.  Since that 1989 album, nearly every album has been superb.  I also wish there were more interviews with the three main singers and songwriters since 1989 -- Jon Langford, Sally Timms, and original member Tom Greenhalgh -- and more on how the musicians' politics informs their music.  Careful listening reveals that they are still socialists!  The focus is on the band's communal spirit and practice, and its dogged refusal to break up in the face of commercial failure.  Their revenge is to continue anyway, a quote from Langford.  There are glimpses of the artistic endeavors of band members outside the band, including Langford's paintings and Susan Honeyman's art gallery.

After going through many changes in membership, the band has been very stable since 1989, with:

Jon Langford -- vocals and guitar
Sally Timms -- vocals
Tom Greenhalgh -- vocals and guitar
Rico Bell -- vocals and accordion
Lu Edmonds -- various and sundry
Susan Honeyman -- violin
Sarah Corina -- bass
Steve Goulding -- drums

I have never heard anything by the band prior to 1989 that I am very impressed by.  Here are the Mekons albums I recommend -- they are all at least very good, and some are Great:

Mekons Rock n Roll (1989)
The Curse of the Mekons (1991)
I Love Mekons (1993)
Retreat From Memphis (1994)
Journey to the End of the Night (2000)
Out of Our Heads! (2002)
Natural (2007)
Ancient & Modern (2011)
Existentialism (2016)

Among bonus features of the DVD is a live performance of nine songs from the concert at the Bell House in Brooklyn on October 7, 2011, featuring the line-up listed above.  This is very welcome, the next best thing to seeing a live concert, but clearly not the same as being there.

""Revenge of the Mekons"" can certainly be recommended to any fan of the band.  It's understandable that the focus is on the punk roots and the country influence, both of which are core elements of the band's mystique.  But it misses giving any insight into the band's best music, which after all is why a band exists, right?  Perhaps a sequel -- ""Mekons Strike Back!"" -- can be devoted to the in-depth examination of the post-1989 Mekons -- the albums listed above -- a body of work as strong as any in folk/rock of recent years.",1464048000,5,4793,5.139175257731959
8715199,5,B00X6RJ17C,"A sweet and entertaining film about the 35 year history of a lovable punk band.  And if that sounds full of contradictions, welcome to the odd world of The Mekons, who started in the late 1970s as art student punks who knew almost nothing about music, only to slowly integrate folk music, American country and western and other influences in with their slowly but steadily growing musicianship, and their passionate politics.

Theyve never gotten rich or famous, but they have put out a treasure trove of recordings full of love of music and crazily mixed up musical ideas.  These are people who are in it for the joy of playing, touring, and communicating with their passionate if limited audience, not money or adoration.  And if they're well into middle age and still traveling around in a shabby van, that doesnt seem to stop them from enjoying the adventure and still loving the music.  In fact, the film makes the argument that the lack of  success and its trappings may be what has kept them together and kept them going:  Friends making music for friends.

Theyre also an intelligent, articulate, funny and likable lot, full of self-deprecating humor about themselves and their accomplishments in a way we rarely think of rock musicians.  I didn't really know the Mekons before seeing this film.  Now I like them and want to really get to know their music.  Thats a pretty good endorsement of a rock-documentary.",1444608000,8,1420,4.8264462809917354
