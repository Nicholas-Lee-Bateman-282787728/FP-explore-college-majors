5334448,5,B009GYS70Q,"I can't believe DALLAS is here again and not in a reboot form but mostly a continuation from the old series. Surely we get new actors to continue the story but the old gang is also here. LARRY HAGMAN, PATRICK DUFFY, LINDA GRAY together with cameos by KEN KENCERVAL , CHARLENE TILTON and STEVE KANALY give the show what it needs. THE GLAMOUR OF THE PAST GLORY DAYS.
 This dvd is spectacular. All 10 season episodes fulled with a pack of extras is all we need and season 2 is on it's way soon...

 SIT BACK AND ENJOY JR'S RETURN TO GLORY...

 PS.

 In europe the same title is released 2 months earlier...LOL

5334475,3,B009GYS70Q,"I knew when this show was rebooted that it was going to continue with the children of the original characters, as it should have, and that was fine. I thought ""Oh Great! A New Dallas, With JR, Bobby, And Cliff Back In Action""! I sat through JR's machinations, with Bobby of course trying to keep the peace while John Ross and Christopher went at each other. I sat through the mysterious behavior of Rebecca and the odd peculiarities of Bobby's wife. I even felt sorry when John Ross got seriously beat up and Sue Ellen put her Political Future in jeopardy. But how does anyone prepare themself for CLIFF. He had his own daughter to marry his nephew.
For all of you who followed the original ""Dallas"" know the story behind how Christopher came to be Bobby's Son. For everyone who haven't, this may be a spoiler for you. Bobby was married to Pam who was the sister of Cliff Barne. Pam and Cliff had some sort of a disorder which could be passed on to their children. Since Pam could not have children she became suidcial. When Sue Ellen's sister, Kristen, was found dead in The Ewing's Pool, it comes out later that she had had a baby. The father, Jeff Farraday, didn't want to keep the child, so he in affect sold the child to Bobby. Bobby, in his desperation to keep Pam from going over the brink, after agreeing to ""Jeff's"" terms, took ""Baby Christopher"" home, saving Pam, her sanity and his marriage. Bobby and Pam did legally adopt Christopher, but Sue Ellen, though she was his aunt, signed away any legal claim to him. Christopher then became Cliff's nephew. Cliff later began a relationship with Afton Cooper and Afton had Rebecca, named after Cliff and Pam's mother. So Cliff, in his ongoing feud, coupled with his over the top greediness, has sacrificed his own daughter to incest.
Some people say ""no it isn't because there isn't a bloodline between Christopher and Rebecca"". Others say ""yes it is because they are first cousins, even though there was an adoption"". In my opinion, they were to closely related, bloodline or not. I DON'T THINK I CAN STOMACH MUCH OF THIS SERIES. I AM DONE!!!!!! I think three stars are to much for this mess, but it was worth seeing some of the old cast again.",1432684800,,2201,4.5465994962216625
5334476,5,B009GYS70Q,"Dallas Season 1 (The Reboot/Sequel/Continuation) has exceeded all of my expectations.  I grew up watching the original Dallas on CBS every Friday. I tuned in to see J.R. being his sneaky powerful self. I also tuned in to watch Sue Ellen hit the bottle, Bobby, trying to stay a good guy through all of the shenanigans, Cliff trying to stake his claim on Ewing Oil.

The three principal characters have returned. Everything blends perfectly. The writing in this series is fast-paced so it requires you to be glued to the television screen so you won't miss a thing.",1432080000,,563,4.73469387755102

5334484,2,B009GYS70Q,"We all knew the original Dallas was something of a soap opera when it was on TV.  But there were great performances and lots of twists and turns to keep us watching.  There were likeable characters and some characters that were so bad they were fascinating.  This new version of Dallas is nothing but a soap opera, and the young characters are just plain dumb and dumber.  J. R., III is a weak punk type.  Christopher is a whining little cry baby.  The only outstanding performance is by Mitch Pileggi as Harris Ryland.  Larry Hagman tries mightily with the material he is given and it is fun to see him and Patrick Duffy back, but they both seem a little lost in this lame attempt at reviving the original show.  The rest of the characters might as well have phoned their performances in.  I won the second season in a contest, so I bought the first season.  Don't think I will bother to buy the third season.",1426118400,,910,4.395209580838324

5334511,4,B009GYS70Q,"As a long time Dallas fan, I approached this new incarnation with excitement and hope. Having heard that the tele-movies (JR Returns and War of the Ewings) were not being considered as canon, I was not sure what to expect. Whilst this series is billed as a continuation, it certainly has a revisionist side to it. The writers have done a reasonably good job to bring us up to speed of where JR, Sue-Ellen, Bobby and their families are. However the tiny cameos from the likes of Ray and Lucy leave us wondering if they are married (they always appear together) - which would not be good as relations. New characters like the Rylands are a good addition to the classic Ewing-Barnes feud. We find John-Ross claiming Ewing Oil is 'back in business' but never really know what became of it (on the original show, Cliff Barnes was the last owner). The love triangle between Elena, John-Ross and Christopher is interesting but complex. Some interesting plots during the season that sees action, drama, romance & adventure prevail. Worth a look",1404432000,,1036,4.761111111111111
5334512,5,B009GYS70Q,"I am a Dallas fan from the late 1970's when the show began & this new series of Dallas did not disappoint. I truly thought where could it go with such a shocking & somewhat ridiculous finale in the old Dallas when the final showed aired. However my thoughts were wrong- it was better than I could have imagined - taking me down memory lane & the same time enjoying the new Dallas in the millenium. Full of twists & turns, great acting & a taste of the elite society of Dallas - I highly recommend this non stop guessing where it goes Dallas!",1400371200,,541,4.211538461538462
5334513,5,B009GYS70Q,"I was very skeptical at first because I did not believe they could make it as good as the original Dallas was. I must say I was very impressed! The characters they chose work well, and the fact that J.R., Bobby and Sue Ellen are on this new Dallas with Cliff Barnes and occasional appearances of Lucy make it seem so original. I can't say enough how hooked I am on this series and now I want to buy all of the original ones to re-watch as well! You won't be disappointed!",1396742400,,471,4.130434782608695

Even as a kid growing up I would stay up and watch it on CBS which at the time was KDFW-TV, I would always get teased a
round about it. The show had it's own character about Dallas, and that is what drew me to watch it.

I still watch it today, and I hope the legacy will continue for another seven or more years, because that is what Larry Hagman would want.",1393286400,,538,4.018691588785047

If you are a fan of the old Dallas without the weirdness that surrounded the series toward the end this should be a delight for you.  The young J.R. is up to the challenge and the rest of the cast is either supporting him or against him.

5334521,4,B009GYS70Q,"Dallas season 1 is a winning combination of old and new.  This is not your standard rehash of old storylines, but is a continuation of the original series set today.  The older Dallas rivals - JR and Bobby, JR and Sue Ellen, the Ewings versus the Barnes - all still exist, and the next generation takes on those plus new ones.  The casting is great, the older cast has aged gracefully, and we aged with them along the way.  The new cast - especially John Ross and Rebecca Sutter are strong and have their own individualized roles.  Christopher and Elena are strong actors, but their flavor has to be fleshed out more in season 2.  The intertwined relationships and family dynamics still drive storylines.  The relationship between JR and Bobby drives the series, and it projects into their sons.  Very enjoyable.",1391126400,2,812,4.709219858156028

5334536,4,B009GYS70Q,"There's something about the new Dallas series that makes it seem somehow reduced in comparison to the sprawling grandeur of the original series (even Southfork  both the house and the land  seem smaller) ... or maybe the old Dallas just seemed bigger from the perspective of a little kid staring up at the TV screen back in the 80s. That aside, the Dallas reboot is certainly worth a peek, especially for fans of Larry Hagman's J.R. Ewing. Hagman returns in exceptional form (like a fine wine just reaching its peak) and delivers a J.R. Ewing in his reclining years that in many ways is even more fascinating and complex than the dastardly oilman we all loved to hate back in the good old days of wheeling and dealing and backstabbing and bed-hopping. Though his bed-hopping days are over, J.R. proves that he still has the knack for wheeling and dealing (and even a little backstabbing). In a clever character twist, this time around J.R. is more hero than antihero. Sure, he's plotting to regain Southfork from younger brother Bobby  and willing to use any means of deception at his disposal to do it  but he's also become Sue Ellen's greatest champion and is willing to risk everything, including his own life, to protect the family when an old rival resurfaces and threatens to take the Ewings down.

Featuring solid performances by Patrick Duffy, Linda Grey, Mitch Pileggi, and Brenda Strong. But make no mistake, this is Larry Hagman's show  from tip to tail, as J.R. would say. In what has got to be one of the most monumental oversights in the history of the Emmy Awards, Larry Hagman was not even nominated for the Dallas reboot (though he was nominated twice for the original series and lost both). What a moment it would have been had Emmy voters opened their eyes to see this magnificent final bow by Hagman reprising his greatest dramatic role, that of the iconic J.R. Ewing ... and doing it with such style and class. There wouldn't have been a dry eye in the house as he stepped up to the stage to accept his long overdue award.",1378598400,,2043,4.629834254143646

5334545,5,B009GYS70Q,"I had caught several commercials for the revival of Dallas.  Never having watched the original series, I decided not to watch the revival, but to start from the very first season from 1978. After having finished all 14 seasons of Dallas, I decided to finally check out the reboot. It's amazing how well this show was handled - like it was a Season 15, not a silly reboot. Classic characters like JR, Bobby, and Sue Ellen are a welcomed addition to the show, and it's nice they aren't used as plot devices to attract older viewers.  They maintain an important connection to the canvas throughout the entire season, sometimes playing more integral roles than the new generation. Speaking of, whoever casted John Ross and Christopher did an absolutely brilliant job - the resemblance between the older actors and the younger actors from the original series is so uncanny you'd think the same actors were in the roles. Separately, Josh Henderson perfectly nails the nuances of being JR's son - a man who wants to be like his father and who wants it all - and is a fitting replacement for Hagman, who unfortunately passed away last year. I haven't started Season 2 yet, but I am excited to, and here's hoping they do the character of JR justice!!",1373760000,,1241,4.6880733944954125

5334552,5,B009GYS70Q,"This is a remarkable achievement, ""Dallas"" taken to today in a new series that is better, more dramatic and more believable than the charming but dated old soapie ever was. The clever aspect of this is the series has picked up on the central thread of the original series (The Ewings Vs the Barnes) and expanded it and developed it for a new generation that may never have seen the original. Whereas the old feud was always a bit of rootin' and tootin' with no one taking it too seriously, it now becomes a vice like drama more in the style of ""The Sopranos"" So so glad the series is expanding to a third season even without the beloved late Larry Hagman as JR whose death is worked brilliantly into the second series. Keep it up guys and you could be here for another 15 years. It is also clever that original characters keep being brought into the series initially in cameo appearances and then later more substantially (ie Ted Shackleford/ Joan Van Ark / Ken kercheval etc).

We old timers remember the original Dallas, and we just can't resist passing the tradition on to the younger generations.  Of course in the meantime we are glued to our sets watching the new Dallas as it continues to unfold, and missing JR.  The show is all about family values!  In a way, of course.  Everyone stands together just long enough to pass through the current crisis, whence they start in on each other as soon as the crisis passes.

They really should throw some of that oil on the troubled waters, but if they did, we would all quit the show!",1366588800,,641,4.530434782608696

5334567,5,B009GYS70Q,"Season 1 of Dallas, seen here, is just incredible. At first, I was concerned that it wouldn't measure up to the 80's series. Well, ""shut the front door"", not only does is meet that quality, it surpasses it. Hagman was great & as another author wrote, was just wonderful: crisp, sharp with that look in his eyes, despite having had Cancer & dealing with older age. God Bless Him, he really brought it out of himself. That's class! All of this would be impossible without wonderful writing. Creative, fast paced, up to speed-- in this decade of what we'd call exciting TV. In comparisson, the 80's series seems passe.",1366156800,,615,4.651376146788991

5334581,5,B009GYS70Q,"Early on I heard some so so to bad reviews.  I don't have cable, so I couldn't see for myself.  I thought this DVD set was pricey for 10 episodes of something that I may regret buying.  Target eventually had it for 21, so I went for it.  I became HOOKED just like on the old Dallas.  Sometimes I find it humerous looking at the old characters because it is like looking at Dallas: The Geriatric Edition.  The characters look good, but really old.  Bobby looks older, but not old.  The others look old.  Old is good because it is a blessing to get there.  Society puts too much emphasis on youth.  Anyway, the show is great!!! It still has the original feel, but what they would have been like with newer technology.  No one has to go looking for people, all they need is the cell phone.  The interenet is a boost in business.  Watching the older DVDs I would always think , ""what would Dallas be like if they had what we have now as far as technology"".  I think the writing is just as great as it was back then.  Hopefully in season 2 Sue Ellen will have a bigger part.  I think the casting of John Ross is amazing...he looks just like the original.  Christopher is just gorgeous.  I have to agree with another reviewer, Elena is my least favorite character.  I would have liked a more Mexican looking girl to play her.  Looking at her background she does have some Latina in her, but she doesn't look Mexican enough for me to play the part.  She reminds me of Alexandra Paul from Baywatch.  She isn't a bad actress, but for the character I would rather see a real Mexican lady for the part since she is suppose to be Mexican.  I hate that I have to wait for season 2 to be over before I get season 2's DVD set.  I refuse to pay for cable or 1.99 to stream an episode, plus it is so much fun to watch the episodes back to back.  With only 10 episodes I finished this set in days.  I will now go back and watch the extras and listen to the commentaries.",1362787200,,1952,4.149732620320855

5334583,5,B009GYS70Q,So being a fan of the original series I had to have this dvd set to go along with my dvd collection of the original classic series. I also got this dvd set at about a third off the original price and it arrived to me very quickly via mail.,1362355200,,239,3.8

I started watching the original series when I was 14 (I was in love with Patrick Duffy).  So when I found out that a new version of the series was coming out, I couldn't wait.  The new cast members are terrific; especially Josh Henderson, who plays J.R.'s son to perfection.  Then you have the gorgeous Jesse Metcalfe, the adopted son of Bobby, who is basically decent, but will not tolerate people that try to push him around.

It was so unfortuneate that Larry Hagman passed away.  I love his one-liners; especially ""now that's my son, from tip to tail.""  I was looking forward to seeing how this season was going to unfold, with him waging battles with just about everybody.

The extras on the DVD were fantastic.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone; whether they are a fan of Dallas, or if they've never seen the original series.",1361491200,,955,4.564705882352941

Its a great script, very good actors: even Larry Hagman was great in this ""new"" Season and also the OLD Rat Cliff Barnes.
In the coming season we will se more of the new generations - really I can't wait to see it.

This NEW update is much better made than the terrible new Melrose Place 2.0 or ""90210"" where older actors/people almost does not appear.

Congrats to the PRODUCERS AND ACTORS!!!!

It will be sad and very different without Larry Hagman but I believe they will find a way to keep going and keep it interesting!  Keep of the good work to everyone involved with Dallas!",1359072000,,341,4.2
5334604,5,B009GYS70Q,"I absolutely LOVED the first season of the new Dallas and as of this review, the 2nd season is coming up next week. The only sad thing is that Larry Hagman will only be a part of about 6 episodes of season 2--at least I now have Season 1 and all the deliciously typical J.R Ewing scenes that went with it. I think a Dallas DVD marathon is in order at my house just to get ready for the Season 2 premiere. Thanks again TNT for releasing this and to Amazon for the nice affordable price! I have Prime but I think this came even quicker than usual.",1358985600,,545,4.055555555555555

5334606,5,B009GYS70Q,"I have been a huge fan of the original DALLAS & have spent sleepless nights watching every episode of the earlier show & when I heard they are bringing everyones favourite show back on television,  I was restless to see it & boy have I been amazed. The 'Season 1' though a bit short is VERY VERY GOOD. The wrting is fantastic, the production values superb, the clothes, the sets, the acting..everything is as good as the original, if not better.  We will all miss Larry Hangman (who plays J.R) the backbone of the original Dallas series who sadly passed away in 2012. We hope the writers are able to fill his void with an equally powerfull character. And we also hope the Ewing family finally unites to jointly take on or face villians from the outside maybe another family that moves into Dallas. Whatever happens I am sure most of us are already hooked & cannot wait for the second season. I have watched several old shows that have been re made however inspite of having better production values etc,  none of them are a patch on the original. The new DALLAS is & we hope it will continue for a very long time.
I also wish some equally great team will rekindle 'DYNASTY'",1358726400,,1173,4.446511627906977
5334607,1,B009GYS70Q,"I have been a Dallas fan my entire life. I was devistated when the series ended 20 years ago. I was so excited when they announced Dallas was coming back! And the original cast like linda gray, patrick duffy and larry hagman were returning as well. Little did i know the modern rewritten CRAP they ended up producing! The sets are hideously ugly, the new actors are terrible and feel like they are reading a script. The entire show lacks the suspense, drama and glamour of the original. Lets face it if not for the original actors coming back, the network would have pulled the plug before the pilot finished airing. I still hold that Dallas ended in 1991 because this modern piece of crap doesnt deserve to share the spot in tv history with the original.",1357689600,2,755,4.518248175182482
5334608,5,B009GYS70Q,"I remember sitting with my grandfather as a kid playing while he watched the original Dallas. Back then I had no idea what was going on, but I did remember names and faces of all the characters. So when they decided to bring the show back, I was thrilled!!! It's absolutely FANTASTIC!!! The cast is amazing and the storyline so far has been intense!! I'm excited for the new season to start at the end of this month. If you haven't watched yet, do it!!! Easily my favorite new show of 2012!!",1357430400,,491,4.3478260869565215
5334609,5,B009GYS70Q,"I loved the original Dallas and while happy to see so many original cast members I was nonetheless skeptical that the story would hold up after all of these years and still manage to be as exciting and dynamic as the original.  I was so pleasantly surprised to see that not only was it as good as the original, in my opinion it is even better!  With J.R. as creatively devious as ever and now schooling his grown son in how to be a rapscallion the wonderful deceit upon which Dallas is built and thrives is as cleverly contrived as it ever was.  Saddened, of course, to learn of the death of Larry Hagman, but interested to see how they weave his death into the new season and wondering if they will be able to maintain the dynamic into a third season without J.R.",1357430400,,764,4.291666666666667
5334610,5,B009GYS70Q,"Watched every episode of the original ""Dallas"" back in the day.  Absolutely love the new series... will very much miss J.R.  It won't be the same without him but I'm sure the writers will make up for his loss somehow.  Have pre ordered the first season and am so glad I did, especially now with Larry Hagman gone.  I will be able to relive his episodes.",1354752000,2,353,4.303030303030303
5334611,4,B009GYS70Q,"Dallas: 2012 Season was GREAT!!!! All the elements, old & new, are there. JR, Bobby, Sue Ellen, Cliff Barnes, Ray, & Lucy are the foundation to presenting the next generation of wheeling & dealing. Good stuff. Sadly, Mr. Hagman passed away during the filming of the second season (only 6 episodes he filmed) due end of January 2013. As they say in show business, ""the show MUST go on."" and I think it will despite JR's end. Long live Dallas!!!!",1354752000,3,444,4.5625
5334612,4,B009GYS70Q,"the return of  Dallas  was  good and it worked, a  good balance of the past and present.  it  says something about  a popular show  from the past  being able to reinvent itself and  making itself  modern. the  show  had  the  back handed  schemes  and  also  alot  of  intriquing  situations.  dallas  is  one  of  the  greatest  shows  ever  and  JR  Ewing  is  a  true  iconic  character and  will  never  be  forgotten.  the  return  is  good.",1354406400,2,446,4.418918918918919
5334613,5,B009GYS70Q,"Well,  this show is just great.  watching how john ross is just like his daddy is so interesting.  I just hope that this show can survive now that larry hagman has passed away.  he was the villian you love to hate, he will be missed.  Rest in peace, larry.",1353715200,,256,4.142857142857143
5334614,3,B009GYS70Q,"I'm an original fan, live a short distance from Southfork for the past 14 years and we original fans are the ones who buy & own all the DVDs. So they should take care to ensure we like the show. The dumbest thing they could do was to start the new show by having Bobby sell Southfork; ignore his son's heritage & opinions; and make stupid decisions without doing any research as if he was some dumb cowboy like Ray Krebbs with no business background. This story line was incredibly offensive to most original fans and alienated any loyalty to Bobby's character.  No one could feel any sympathy for him. What idiot wrote that? Duffy? Hagman?

The new cast members all look alike & the writing will have to improve by 80%. Hopefully by finding some new writers who actually know the original series. For instance, Bobby did not inherit Southfork. Miss Ellie, via Clayton Farlow, signed over ownership of Southfork to Bobby in the last season and gave JR the control of Ewing Oil shares.  So John Ross could not overturn something that occurred before her Will which had nothing to do with Bobby owning Southfork.

We all know the mineral rights for Southfork were always separate from the deed and used to trap Jeremy Wendell when dumb Ray sold his land. JR never would have forgotten that.

Sue Ellen did not hide John Ross away at boarding schools... JR did. John Ross joined his mother because JR had become so consumed with James and destroying Cally over Weststar and Vanessa. So John Ross's comments were off base.

The only 2 new characters with any charisma and character potential are Rebecca and Bobby's wife Ann. The rest of the new cast are duds and should be recast with new actors after they find new writers who actually watched the entire original series. Not some short attention span newbie who scanned through the episodes.

Cliff's seething revenge attitude no longer makes sense. He owns Ewing oil and JR was a vegetable in a nursing home when the new series began. Cliff should be happy & gloating; not creating devious destruction plans and certainly would not hurt his nephew Christopher. Cliff also never wanted Southfork. That was miss Ellie's home, not oil well's that Jock stole from Digger. The only person Cliff should be angry at and seeking revenge upon is Afton who cruelly and illegally kept his daughter from seeing or knowing him. Or angry at JR; if & when he tries to take back Ewing Oil.

Someone also needs to convince Hagman that those ridiculous eyebrows are not his trademark. They make him look like some Alzheimer geezer who is incapable of personal grooming. The eyebrows are nasty.

Duffy and Hagman also need to do better with the characters of Lucy and Ray. Those fleeting cameos were an insult to the actors and fans. They were both core characters who battled JR. We need to see more of them but without repeats of old mistakes as if they never learned their lessons. They should be stronger and smarter now but angry with Bobby for the selling Southfork fiasco.

Also, let us not forget about Lucas - Bobby's natural son, as well as James and Cally's baby who were both Jr's natural born offspring. They each have claims on the Ewing legacy.

Focusing the later episodes of the original series on Bobby & JR with an endless parade of Bimbo's for their off~set pleasure is what destroyed Dallas the first time and permanently chased away Victoria Principal. Just look at the ratings after Pam and then even more so when Sue Ellen left and the ratings plummeted. Hagman & Duffy & the producer Katzman were so blinded by the procession of Bimbo's, they couldn't see their decisions were the problem.

Dallas was not a male fan dominated series. Vast numbers of women watched it for the glamour & power & interactions of the cast. (Glamour: as in jewels, clothes, furs, money... not bimbo's and sex). Especially the interactions of Sue Ellen & Pam fighting back to hold their own. They ruined Pam by making her run away and whine instead of sticking by Bobby & fighting for their marriage. Sue Ellen was at her best when she was successful and not rolling in the gutter. The bimbo's were shallow and offensive to both male and female fans. Any viewers who need an endless parade of swimsuit models to keep their interest - are not watching Prime time soap operas. They are watching the X rated channels or out cruising street corners and bars.

The producers should have a little common sense this time and don't depend on those hack Nielson ratings and opinions which never contact the actual audience and caused cancellations of wildly popular shows that has enraged fans for decades. Most of the fans and cast have died waiting for a new Dallas and the original Dallas DVD sets which took forever to complete; while some anarchistic Xgen tried to create a mockery comedy to get revenge on their parents generation. Thanks to Travolta for refusing to go along with it.

Let us hope they learn from their mistakes this time before it is too late. This show can be a success again if they don't waste this second chance which has taken far too long.",1351728000,4,5094,4.658129175946548
5334615,5,B009GYS70Q,"I didn't get to watch dallas when it aired in the 80's, having been born in 1979 myself. However, I had grown up hearing about ""Who shot JR?"" so I knew about the show. Watching this new dallas had prompted me to want to watch the old dallas. The new dallas is just as good as the old one was, with all the plotting, scheming, and back biting. Looking foward to getting this on DVD & really looking forward to season 2! And for those who haven't seen it, JR really is a guy you love & hate @ the same time!!!!",1351641600,2,508,3.9901960784313726
5334616,4,B009GYS70Q,"As a passionate fan of the original I was concerned that this sequel would disappoint.  However, it hasn't, except for the dramatic change in the interior of Southfork. Yes, in 20 years one would expect it to be redecorated and refurbished generally - but the whole layout of the interior to change....? The main staircase clearly moved since it now bears no relation to the other rooms in the way that it did; small rooms; a different dining room because it does not relate to the kitchen as it used to....  These differences are really quite profound and are the elements that have detracted for me because I find it hard to believe that they are in the same house.  I used to love Southfork - but not now. The style, the light, the space, the elegance have all gone.

But having said that, it is great to have JR, Bobby and Sue Ellen back - as well as the brief appearances by Cliff, Lucy and Ray. How about Jenna and so many others who were apparently still alive at the end of the first DALLAS?  In reality, their lives would be very likely to still impinge on the present at times and it would be great if they returned, even if only briefly so that they could update their stories.  I am delighted to read that Gary and Valene are to come back in the next season.  The new cast are fine, but Bobby's new wife is not Pam (nor even April) and because of the change in fashion the glitz has gone - everyone is much more ordinary.  And I do miss Miss Ellie and Clayton (and, of course, Jock.) Now, if Victoria Principal could be persuaded to return, think what storylines might open up there!

Nevertheless, I have the complete set of the orginal DALLAS as well as all the supplementary products that have emerged - so, despite the odd gripe, I shall undoubtedly buy the new series, too. It has made a strong start in retaining the general characteristics of the original and the very best of luck to it - I hope it develops as brilliantly as its predecessor.

Now, please get the original Knots Landing released on DVD and then bring that back 20 years on...!",1350777600,3,2063,4.37696335078534
5334617,5,B009GYS70Q,"The new Dallas was fantastic.  Lived up to all expectations.  Kept to the original story with JR and Bobby playing a big part, but at the same time, letting the sons take more in control.  Well worth the money.  I will order the set when it is available in BlueRay and be one of the first to get it.  Twists and turns keep you guessing all the time.",1349395200,6,349,4.073529411764706
5334618,5,B009GYS70Q,"During the summer of 2012 cable's TNT aired ""Dallas"", not repeats, but a new series that is a continuation of the original CBS soap opera that ran from 1978-1991. People didn't know if the serial was going to be a hit or not as many believe (stupidly) that scripted dramas are a wave of the past and something viewers don't want to watch. ""Dallas"" became the highest-rated drama of 2012 beating even network shows and proved the timeless story of good vs. evil in a tight-knit Texas family who backstabs each other is still relevant today.

 With three of the original cast members included (Linda Gray, Patrick Duffy and most deliciously Larry Hagman as J.R.) along with a bunch of newcomers playing the sons of Bobby and J.R. (stud Jesse Metcalf (of ""Passions"" fame) as Christopher and Josh Henderson as John Ross, with excellent writing and direction, not to mention that timeless opening theme and music ""Dallas"" became the must-see TV event of 2012. TNT already has ordered 15 more shows for the summer of 2013 signalling their faith in the series.

 This set will include all 10 episodes along with a slew of bonus material including ""Southfork legacy: Making of Dallas-Season 1"" where the cast and creators discuss having ""Dallas"" come back, ""Back in Production"" where both J.R.'s (Larry Hagman and Josh Henderson) give a tour of the first day of filming, deleted scenes, pilot commentary with writer and executive producer Cynthia Cidre and executive producer and director Michael Robin and much more.

 ""Dallas"" it is so nice to have you back!!!!!

 Of special note Steve Kanaly, Charlene Tilton and Ken Kercehevel also return this year.",1348790400,9,1646,4.9169675090252705
