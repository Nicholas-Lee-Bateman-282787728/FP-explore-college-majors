372194,3,630181391X,"""Making Contact"" deals with Joey. A nine year old kid who has just seen his father passed away. Not only that, but all the other kids at  school pick on him constantly. That's when things take a turn for the  worst. Joey starts to talk to his father on his toy phone and then starts  to move things with his mind. He starts to act weird around his mother  which gets her afraid and mystified (as he shows her his powers too). One  day, while walking his dog, he goes into a mine and finds a dummy. He takes  the dummy to his room and finds out a dummy which could of been nice, is  pure evil. The dummy tries to kill his only friend, his mother, and  anything else who tries to come in it's way. When Joey's enemy get locked  in the house above the mine due to the dummy and are locked in a maze, Joey  is the only one who can save them before they all die due to the dummy.
As I said, ""Making Contact"" is not your regular kid flick, it  mixes horror/sci-fi/children's genre and dosen't come out perfect (it also  rips off lots of '80s blockbusters at a time too). This film might be hated  by lots of people, but I liked it. It's one of my guilty pleasures. It's  not really a fun movie, but it's watchable.",965865600,4,1208,4.085106382978723

7816241,4,630181391X,"Everything about this movie is at odds with reality. Certian films achieve just the right level of production value, wierdness, and obscurity that make them seem out of sync with your world.

Also helping to aid wierd gems like this are the clear attempts to mimic the tone and feel of other successful films from the same era. You'd watch something like ET and Poltergeist and that night dream you watched a movie called Making Contact. It's happened to me plenty of times, except Making Contact is a real film!

Movies from expired decades are finite. That's why coming across ones we have never seen or heard of from a bygone era like the 80s are so special. It's also why an out of print title like this is so expensive. People who have been fortunate enough to know it want it in their collection.

The 80s was an explorative decade for cinema. Kid's films did not have the cookie cutter template for the tone that sells best to the masses as we have today. There is far more social ambiguity in kids movies from the 80s than you could ever hope to find in cinema aimed at children today.

It's a fun ride, from one bizarre concept to the next, but don't expect great performances. Just watch it and maybe question what alternate dimension this weird commercial for all things 80s came from. I assume they were paid to promote Star Wars, ET, Disney, etc?? What a strange and wonderful glitch in the Matrix!",1409702400,,1411,4.52156862745098

7816244,2,630181391X,"Well, I recently saw this movie for the first time, and it was given to me by a good friend who totally loves it. With that in mind, I feel bad about having to share my very contrary opinion of it. But, first, a brief synopsis.

Joey is a 9-year-old boy who just lost his father. However, he is still in contact with daddy over a toy telephone. Along with this new phenomenon, Joey has also acquired strange powers of telekinesis, and it's rather unclear why, but all the toys in his room have a tendency to come to life (not just with movement, but literally ""alive""). Talking to his dead father on a toy telephone makes Joey a target of the local school bullies, a gang of kids who are looking more for a play war against easy odds than to bully him in a really hardcore way. His one friend throughout is a cute little blonde girl fascinated by Joey's ability to wiggle her pigtails with his mind. Joey's strange new life is also causing stress on his widowed mother, and things only become worse when Joey's house-call making teacher gets a bunch of scientists involved. They transform his home into a full-on laboratory. The biggest problem Joey has though, is a mysterious living ventriloquist's dummy he finds that seems to be inhabited by something evil. The dummy doesn't want Joey speaking to his dead father anymore.

And, that's as brief as I could keep that synopsis. As you can see, there is a lot going on in ""Making Contact"", AKA ""Joey"", a film that mostly had me thinking, ""What the heck is going on? And why?!!"" I still am not sure. For the most part though, and I know my friend who loves this movie really doesn't like it when people say this, but... I feel one-hundred-percent that this movie was an attempt to combine E.T. and Poltergeist. And, that's it. It seems exactly that, to me. I feel like people who love this one mainly love it because they saw it as kids. I love a lot of so-so movies for that same reason myself. I hate it when people say I just love something for ""nostalgic reasons"", but... I guess sometimes it can't be denied, and I feel like that's gotta be the main reason this movie gets any love. And, I can understand why a kid would like it. Like in E.T. and Poltergeist, you see a typical bedroom of a kid who has a lot of 80's-child toys, and they start to float around and come to life. Kids love to see that. I don't know why. We love to see a bunch of Star Wars toys in a kid's bedroom when we watch a movie too, because we all had a ton of those. We love to see an AT-AT toy in a movie. This movie has one that comes to life. For some reason, that is awesome for a lot of us to see. As little boys, we secretly love cute blondes in pigtails, we outspokenly love cameos by Lord Vader, and who doesn't love evil dummies? This movie has all of that. What it doesn't have is a coherent plot, in my opinion. It's just a lot of weird stuff. If there's a message about letting go of those we lose to death, I don't really see how it is brought forth here. It never really even seemed to be made clear whether or not that really was Joey's dad he was talking to. Actually, a lot of stuff in this movie was unclear and I just didn't get the point of most of it. The DVD provides a disc with the U.S. version and a disc with the German version, and personally, I can't say one works better than the other. At times, I felt the German version was doing better. Then, sometimes I felt the opposite.

This movie was directed and co-written by Roland Emmerich of ""Independence Day"" fame. Frankly, I like and even love some of his blockbuster films, like ""The Patriot"". I even liked his ""Godzilla"" film. Maybe I was the only one. However, ""Making Contact"", AKA ""Joey"", just doesn't work for me, despite my love of kids' fantasy movies and seeing a toy Millennium Falcon battle toy Tie Fighters. If the plot had made more sense/had more purpose, I might feel differently. Emmerich's work certainly has improved by leaps and bounds though, and I am glad that childhood favorites like this ARE getting 2 disc DVD releases. I'd be sad if I didn't have my copy of ""Monster Squad"" to put on every now and then.

""Making Contact"" is presented in enhanced widescreen and includes only the German theatrical trailer as a bonus feature. The German version can be viewed with English subtitles. The film appears to have been shot in English (in the U.S.?) though it seems like it is dubbed in both versions.",1301788800,,4430,4.333734939759037
7816245,5,630181391X,"On the surface Making Contact seems like a horror movie for kids, and it works well on that level, with plenty of special effects, and not too scary.  It has an interesting basic idea, about a boy who makes contact with his late father by phone.  He comes into telekinetic powers, and later finds a scary ventriloquist's dummy in an abanoned house who tells him the voice on the phone isn't his father, but an evil entity to be avoided.  But should you really believe a scary ventriloquist's dummy? Similar ideas were used in later films like White Noise and others.

The film is underrated for specific reasons. It tries to be more of a fantasy of the genre that deals with near-death or after-death experiences (Heaven Can Wait, The Dust Factory, etc.) than just a horror film, but this makes the plot seem uneven.  Some scenes seem like deliberate imitations of Spielberg and other horror films.  However, some clever and stirring moments shine through, particularly the ending.  Other horror movies with child protagonists include Thirteen Ghosts, The Lady In White, and Sixth Sense.  In terms of special effects alone, Making Contact has more to offer that these; but the others are scarier and more enjoyable to adults.

I recommend this film more to fans of films like Dragonfly and Just Like Heavan than people who want to be seriously frightened.",1158624000,5,1355,4.8311688311688314
7816246,4,630181391X,"Things have been strange for Joey (Joshua Morrell) since his father's death! he's been given telepathic and telekinetic abilities that allows him to make his toys come to life and can contact with his dead father on a toy phone. He's an unpopular kid at school because he tells him his secret but they laugh at him especially the local bullies and has only one friend, one day he walks his pet toy robot (whom looks like one of the robots from ""The Black Hole"") that's alive into an old house in his neighborhood and discovers a ventriloquist dummy (whom looks like Col. Clink from ""Hogan's Heroes"") to add it to his toy collection. It later turns out the dummy is possessed by a demon with powers similar to Joey's only more stronger and threatens Joey, his mother, friends and the city with demons from another dimension for Joey is the only one to stop it.

An entertaining, dark and cool supernatural horror fantasy from Germany and director Roland Emmerich who gave us ""Stargate"", ""The Patriot"", ""Independence Day"" and ""The Day After Tommorow"". It's labeled as a kid's movie but it's kind of dark and scary for small children, i remembered when i was young back in the 80's watching this on video it scared the hell out of me especially with that dummy and the second movie to cause my fear of dummies when i was young besides ""Magic"". The special effects are very good for it's time considering this is a foreign movie, there's also a bittersweet ending to this movie and if you want a movie to scare your kids then this could be it, and the music score on both versions are very good as well.

This 2-Disc DVD set contains both the cut dubbed American version from ""New World Pictures"" and the uncut full length German language with English Subtitles version and the only extras there are is trailers but the sound and picture are quite good on both versions.

7816247,2,630181391X,"Between E.T., Poltergeist, and yes Star Wars, this movie had nothing original to it! And I'm not just talking about the plot, I'm talking lighting effects, camera angles.......And I also found myself dozing off more than once during this movie.

If you liked this movie, I recomend: Watching something better, like E.T. or Star Wars or something like that.
What I learned from ""Making Contact"": Dummies are frickin scary...o wait, I already knew that.",1056585600,,451,5.094594594594595
