6242981,5,B00HXJIK4E,"Just to clarify about this set from the prior reviewer of this set.....They just posted the release on tvshowsondvd.com.....looks like there are some skits that were never released before on the mega-set or any other set. Among them are Tim Conway's oldest man (Fireman), one skit featuring Charo and one ""As the Stomach Turns"" featuring Valerie Harper (""Rhoda""). None of these skits were ever on any of the past releases.  I have been hoping and waiting for the 2 skits (Tim Conway's Fireman & The Charo skit) cause to my dissappointment, these skits never made it to the Mega set.  So I am happy to know, this set has some new skits!!!

Mind you, there maybe some skits that were previously released on other collections, however there are some new skits new to DVD on this set as well as 2 new bonus features (featuring Tim Conway).....this is a definite must-have for those who are looking for additional skits from ""The Carol Burnett Show"" collection.",1394755200,35,956,4.781818181818182

This review is for the 6-disc version:
10 OF THESE HAVE EVER BEEN RELEASED TO DVD! Neither by Columbia House, Guthie Renker, or previous Time-Life sets!
This is great news for us fans!
I wish Time-Life didn't re-use the collection title for their 12 disc set as it has nothing to do with that set!

6243052,3,B00HXJIK4E,"Greeting Reviewer,
When I was younger, I enjoyed watching and experiencing the humor on The Carol Burnett Show.  So when the DVD version came out I purchased three of the season sets.  I must have viewed the program with more innocent eyes back then. When I started viewing the recorded DVD season series, I did not realize how much ""Adult"" content (PG-13) was seen on TV back then.  I am not a prude, but I feel a level of responsibility to filter what my young children view and absorb. So I gave a rating for Adult content of 4-star rating (PG-13) for adults, but for the family I give it a rating of 3-stars as it definitely is not (PG) for children.",1453420800,,654,4.344262295081967

6243061,3,B00HXJIK4E,"This was ok, but I don't understand why it was called ""crack ups"". Don't get me wrong, there were a couple of sketches where people were cracking up mainly because of Tim Conway (who was awesome to watch), but I guess I was expecting more bloopers and more of the actors and actresses to crack up.

They just weren't that funny.  A couple parts were, yes - but in general.... I think the infomercial played all the funny parts there were.

6243106,5,B00HXJIK4E,"I have to go back to these type videos when I get so sick of disgusting movies and stuff on tv these days.  Back when clean fun for the entire family.  Movies and tv sitcoms are nothing but porn and for some reason, the scum in Hollywood believe that everyone on earth cusses like the devil!  There are still some of us that show consideration and respect toward others and refrain from such trash talk, but then those that talk this way are trash.....",1402012800,6,452,4.357142857142857

6243110,3,B00HXJIK4E,"Disappointed by this collection, based on the title. There are many classic skits where Tim Conway breaks up the cast. Many of these are even mentioned in the featurettes included as bonus material. I was hoping that this was a collection of the shows those classic scenes came from or at least a collection of those skits, but this apparently random selection of shows contain next to none of those classic ""crack-ups"". What was the point of calling this Carol's Crack-Ups if none of those crack-ups are being featured?",1398038400,38,520,4.853932584269663

8637207,5,B00HXJIK4E,Carol Burnett. What can I say about Carol Burnett other than her show was simply a riot to watch. What a brilliant comedian. I cant believe I have all of her shows on DVD. Im so happy to have them. I looked forward to her show coming on every week when I was growing up.,1521331200,,270,3.9272727272727272
8637208,1,B00HXJIK4E,"Just very disappointed, because the title suggests this will contain ONLY comedy sketches.  Instead it is mostly a selection of a few full episodes of her show with interviews, songs, etc., and just two comedy sketches per episode.  There are some extra comedy episodes added, I believe, but I was so disappointed after watching the first two episodes that I have not watched any more of the disc.  Will give the rest a try someday.  And then donate it to a library so others will not need to spend their money on it.",1520899200,3,517,4.526881720430108
