The DVD consists of three 'music videos'; the single quotes indicate that the term is used loosely...as the videos are basically just footage of the 5 Browns playing their five pianos in a desert or an airplane hanger.

Videos feature the following songs:

1.  American Hymn Fantasy
2.  Rhapsody In Blue (George Gershwin)
3.  The Firebird (Igor Stravinsky)",1188864000,5,505,4.882352941176471
