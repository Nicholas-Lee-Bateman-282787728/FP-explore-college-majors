202235,5,1896306918,"This features Liam Neeson in one of his earliest roles as an Irish priest,  Michael Lamb, who befriends a boy at a remand school and takes him away  with him, when he suffers a crisis of faith. What makes the film compelling  and unusual is in the shifting tone. The initial school scenes play like  Dickens, and after Lamb and the boy run away to London, Neeson plays  straight man to Hugh O'Conor's Owen, who gives surprisingly funny line  readings. The first time we hear him speak is a riot when he tells Lamb  ""I don't give a f**k"". Then as Lamb begins to realise his limited  options when he is being hunted for kidnapping, he makes a shocking  decision as to how to resolve his predicament. Owen is an epileptic, and I  like how director Gregg shows that what makes him have a seizure is a  moment of joy. The first one is preceded by a big close-up of his innocent  face. I also like the way Gregg shows Lamb's reaction to a death from  outside a window, and his use of U2's In the Name of Love when Lamb and  Owen have their faces printed onto each other's t-shirts. Neeson is  touching as Lamb, particularly in the way he yearns for the boy to return  his tenderness, and also his height makes him look great in priest getup.  The conclusion of this film is unforgettable, though the Van Morrison music  of dread gives us clear warning. We actually open with a frame from the  end, but by the time we realise it, it's too late to be prepared.",969321600,8,1452,4.311111111111111
202236,1,1896306918,"I am a huge Liam Neeson fan and waited MONTHS for a copy to be available. What a disappointment! Terrible script--it seemed unfinished; the story is depressing and frustrating. Make that ""ZERO"" stars! Sorry, Liam.",954115200,,213,5.114285714285714
202237,5,1896306918,"Esta produccion irlandesa de 1985 engloba los sentimientos encontrados entre un cura educador ( Liam Neeson ) y un nino de 9 anios (Hugh O'Connor) que es llevado al reformatorio catolico de St. Kiaran debido a supuestas  alteraciones de conducta y extrema agresividad. La historia muestra lo que  puede llevar la desesperacion humana de un hombre de Dios para lograr la  supuesta sanacion espiritual de un nino gravemente atormentado por una  enfermedad neurologica. Una historia triste, real y humana, caracterizada  por la exelente actuacion de un pequeno actor practicamente desconocido,  pero con gran talento dramatico. Es una pelicula fuerte y muy diferente a  lo que habitualmente estamos acostumbrados a ver ! Recomendable para  personas con amplitud de criterio.

202239,2,1896306918,I would not recommend this movie.  Liam Neeson is one of my favorite actors and that is why I watched it.,1489276800,,105,4.0
202240,1,1896306918,"So after being abused by his father, mother, and men his mother hooked up with, the boy had to suffer the worst at the hands of a failed priest who was too afraid to leave the church in a decent way?  He had to leave in the middle of the night?  His parents were already dead, so who did he think he was going to disappoint by leaving the church?  I guess the point of the movie was that the adult was more of a naive child than the child actually was.  My biggest question, I guess, is why did I punish myself by watching it to the end?  I guess I was also naive enough to expect somehow a happy ending to all of this misery.",1488758400,4,626,3.8976377952755907

202243,3,1896306918,Neeson brings great life to his character as he faces a crisis of faith. His journey with a child in difficulty pleads for a happy ending. It shows again the consequences of our choices.,1485820800,,186,4.5

202247,3,1896306918,very depressing saga of a highly disturbed individual who unintentionally destroys lives.  Liam is a well meaning but tragic figure. Great performance.  I would never consider watching it again.,1483747200,7,194,5.655172413793103

202250,2,1896306918,"Bizarrely unaffecting considering the plot line. There is no real tension, and the believability factor is nil.  I think it's just a rotten screenplay. And the out of the blue violent ending is like kick in the shins of the viewer who has suffered through the ridiculously over long film..",1482537600,5,289,4.78

202253,2,1896306918,"The story line is wonderful, unfortunately, the audio was awful!  You could barely here Liam when he spoke - it was very hard to understand any of the dialog.

202254,5,1896306918,"This is an brilliant ,while at the same time,a very unusual movie. It was released in 1985,but somehow I had never heard of it until I came across the DVD.By the way,several reviewers have stated that they were very disappointed with the reproduction quality of the DVD.I am writing this review under the VHS version,as the DVD I have is not like the double movie .Mine has only one,""Lamb""and I found no problems with it. It was by Direct Source Special Products,ISBN 1-896306-91-8,Item #DVD 20089.
 The movie has a lot of interesting characters and well played,but really only Brother Michael Lamb (Liam Nesson) and Owen Kane (Hugh O'Connor) have major parts. The whole story is really about them,and the other characters appear only briefly. The movie is totally an Irish movie ,though part of the story takes place and was filmed in London. There are some great scenes of the Irish countryside,St. Kiaran's Reform School in Galway,beaches,and street scenes and other locations in London;but it is by no mean a travelogue.
 The story is very emotional,and both Kane and Lamb are struggling hard in coming to terms with their lives and situations. Watching the movie,you will also feel their problems. Both Nesson and O'Connor are excellent for these roles and played them masterfully.
 Of course,you are really wanting to know how things are going to work out for them;but the thing that makes this movie one that is unusual,and which will remain with you;is the sudden and totally unexpected ending.",1329782400,,1502,5.0
202255,1,1896306918,"The VHS I received of this movie was in very poor condition. Throughout the whole movie you could hardly see any of the picture clearly: it was grainy, flicking, & you could NOT see most of the video.  I think I was sent a replacement copy, but the quality of the picture was still very poor with the video looking mottled & unclear/not sharp. --It's been a while since I purchased this product.",1299024000,,395,4.410958904109589
202256,1,1896306918,"What a disappointment!,
I TOO am a huge Liam Neeson fan, but What a disappointment!
A FRAGMENTED script--VERY depressing and frustrating.
ENDS ABRUPTLY LIKE COMING TO A DEAD END AFTER GOING
A LONG DISTANCE WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS.",1252800000,,229,5.216216216216216
202257,3,1896306918,"What a surprise!  This early Neeson movie has a lot to offer--good acting by Mr. Neeson, who turns on the compassion very convincingly.  The other actors are very believable, especially the young lad who does an amazing job of acting out the seizures his character is subject to.  The storyline is pure Irish tragedy:  a naive priest (Neeson), an abused child and indifference from the principals.  The coastal scenery is just beautiful--though I'm not sure it is the Antrim coast--the credits say it was filmed in the Republic.  And I couldn't help but wonder if it ever gets warm enough up there (Antrim coast) to actually take a dip.  Worth watching!",1042070400,2,653,4.828828828828829
7801107,5,1896306918,"A great movie except for the ending; a story about a boy being physically and emotionally abused at home and elsewhere, including the boarding school where he finally ended up. Then this priest (Liam Neeson) deserted his post and his religion, so it seems, and then he absconded with the boy. The movie, in large part, was the joy and the love given the boy by the priest, thus allowing the boy to seek those things of interest to him; those things he never have gotten at home. That's the part I really like, thus the five stars. But then the ending was like watching a different movie or maybe we finally got to see who this priest was really like.",1521072000,,650,4.380165289256198
7801108,1,1896306918,The whole lot who made this film are bloody lunatics and they just wanted to play devil's advocate and ruin what would have been a watchable movie,1515369600,,146,4.444444444444445
7801109,5,1896306918,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Just because it didn't have a Hallmark ending doesn't mean the sad story wasn't moving. The portrayal of love and kindness for another human being, even if it involves poor judgment was moving. Excellent acting and shows life in a real way.",1511654400,,272,4.808510638297872
7801110,2,1896306918,"Started out with lots of potential and slowly went downhill. Somehow, I watched until the end.",1509321600,,94,4.9375
7801111,1,1896306918,I agree with all of the previous reviews.  I kept waiting for something redeeming to happen....couldn't believe I watched it that horrible ending.,1501891200,,146,5.3478260869565215
7801112,2,1896306918,"It was ALMOST a good movie, but fell far short and was ruined in the last 5 minutes by the ending. The sensible ending would have been returning and having the boy testify to his mother's abuse. Of course, I don't know how the actual law of the times would have gone, but I know the Catholic church has a very highhanded authority over children and keeping them from their parents (Movie Evelyn is good and ends well, about parental rights and the Catholic church). Liam should have adopted him. Clearly his mother didn't want him. Liam's $2000 could have been sacrficed to adopt the boy and made the ending good. Then there would be no more need to hide and Liam could have had the help of friends instead of trashy people.",1501200000,,724,4.451127819548872
7801113,1,1896306918,"This is a terrible movie.  It started out good, but you will feel so ripped off by it.  It also is homophobic in portraying a gay man as a potential pervert because he is gay.  Cannot understand Liam Neeson doing this movie.",1499472000,,224,4.285714285714286
7801114,4,1896306918,"I enjoyed this because Liam Neeson is young and handsome!! The actors are interesting and do a great job with the script.  I was surprised that the Liam Neeson character fails to make sensible plans. The young priest has good intentions, yet stumbles about without a sensible plan as though he is a child trying to figure out how life works. That surprised me and how the story progressed surprised me.",1497139200,,402,4.661971830985915
7801115,1,1896306918,Horrible horrible horrible..........ridiculous ending. This movie makes no sense has no plot or outline. Wish there was a less than one star rating. Can't believe I sat and watched it.........was hoping for a better ending. The Liam character is still left unresolved and running away with the kid on a quest that had no closure and was pointless. They could have at least thrown in something else in one of the scenes where they were caught or he took him back to the home and the fight for custody or something for the kid.........at least something to make the movie more interesting. I sat and watched it just to see the end and what would happen to him and the kid and it was unbelievable pointless! Bad writing of the movie but despite all that the acting was ok. I guess that's what makes it a one star!!!,1496880000,,812,4.493243243243243
7801116,4,1896306918,"The movie LAMB was based on an early novel of the same title by Bernard MacLaverty, one of the finest writers of fiction to emerge since the mid-1970s. LAMB joins the better known movie CAL, based on a subsequent MacLaverty novel of the same title, as the two most lauded films drawn from MacLaverty's writing to date. If you dislike the movie LAMB, as many of the commentators here seem to do, I urge you to read the novel, which is superb. (By the way, CAL is even more brilliant a novel than LAMB, and MacLaverty's short stories are also compelling.) The subtext often driving MacLaverty's writing is an almost foreordained tendency of many of his characters to destroy the people and things they love, whether immediately or eventually--and sometimes both. My advice is to read the novels LAMB and CAL before watching the films based on them. CAL, starring Helen Mirren and John Lynch, is an absolutely terrific 1984 movie with an equally impressive soundtrack by Mark Knopfler that also features singer Paul Brady and uilleann piper Liam OFlynn on it. (One of the most underrated or overlooked aspects of Knopflers musical career is the number of impressive movie soundtracks hes created, including THE PRINCESS BRIDE and LOCAL HERO, a neglected 1983 film gem directed by Bill Forsyth and starring Burt Lancaster and Peter Riegert.)",1496188800,,1337,4.920353982300885
