8337177,1,B001R23H2I,"While the product description gives you the impression that it is a historical documentary, the film or rather this slide show is nothing but a collection of old drawings which appear to have no direct connection with the topic, since no captions or commentaries justify their relevance. Besides not being a cheap dvd which you can put aside without much regret, this dvd is ridiculously short (21 mins.) & its inferior content/format does not qualify it as a true historical documentary.  I've seen much better free slide shows compiled by amateurs in U-Tube & much better documentary dvds for a third of its price.  While this slide show may be of interest to a few, in the least, this product was definitely misrepresented in its description.",1245369600,3,745,4.904761904761905
