The subtitled translations are not that great, but if you don't speak Italian you would never notice and it doesn't contribute to anything being missed or lost within the plot or anything. I highly recommend this film",1141344000,6,375,4.696969696969697
2398889,5,B000AYELX8,"""Caterina in the Big City"" is a lively, quirky movie, similar in tone to something like ""Amelie."" Like ""Amelie,"" it is about something very small (in this case, a girl moves to Rome and learns life lessons and such) but somehow feels bigger-than-life. The actress who plays Caterina does a wonderful job and the other kids in the movie are outstanding. There's a nice bit of politics, human nature, romance, and more than a bit of comedy.

Very entertaining!",1137801600,8,458,4.7974683544303796
8081153,4,B000AYELX8,Very interesting cultural story to watch.  I bought it to practice hearing Italian.....Not always easy to follow with the story being a bit disjointed at times but I did enjoy it and the ending which is a bit unexpected but fits the story....,1496448000,,242,4.627906976744186

8081157,4,B000AYELX8,"don't read if you don't want plot items revealed...other reviewers have branded this a coming of age story...true enough, but the sub plot is the father, a middle aged man slowly becoming estranged from his family and losing his grip in the workplace as well. a scene outside the cafe kinda characterizes the entire picture when caterina's new friend dismisses her with cab fare, on his mother's orders. alas moving to roma is not the same as living in a small town... filmed around rome,you'll recognize some of the places if you've been before.",1235520000,4,546,4.819148936170213
8081158,5,B000AYELX8,"This excellent Italian comedy is very similar in plot to Mean Girls (who came out on theaters in about the same time). The difference is that this is a much more politicized film. Caterina is a shy teenager from a small town in Italy, who moves to Rome with her long-suffering mother and her teacher father, when he is assigned to a new job there. In her new school, she has to choose to what clique to belong: the children of the progressive intellectuals or the children of the rich industrialists. The left or the right. What this film says is that these people are not terribly different between themselves. They both hold a degree of fame and power in Italian society, and look down upon those who don't. The outstanding performance in the movie is that of Caterina's father, the teacher Giancarlo (Sergio Castellito), a hothead angry that others have gotten all the breaks in life, who rants against the rich and privileged but who would sell his soul in a second in order to join the establishment. He is a familiar type of malcontent in real life but one who is seldom shown in the movies. There is a silly subplot of Caterina falling in love with an Australian boy, but all in all, this is one of the best Italian movies of the last years.",1170115200,2,1248,4.478070175438597
8081159,5,B000AYELX8,"I had read a favorable review of this movie earlier this year in the N.Y. Times and was pleasantly surprised to find it on the shelf at our public library. What a pleasant surprise.

This is a coming-of-age film about a 13 year-old girl who moves from a small and remote Italian town to the ultra-sophisticated world of Rome. Think ""Mean Girls"", with a touch of Amy Heckerly's ""Clueless"". But ""Catarina"" rises above the usual teen farce by integrating Catarina and her classmates into the {corrupt}adult world around them. The fine editorial review above is an excellent summary of the story and I will not try to duplicte it.

As the Times' reviewer pointed out, ""Catarina"" shows how we now have a global youth culture. The girls of Roma are easily recognized as variants on American teens, with their own clothes, issues, etc.

Alice Tergil is superb as the sweet, but naive, newcomer. An excellent cast all-around.

8081160,4,B000AYELX8,"I really enjoyed this film. Caterina is a country girl who moves to Rome with her parents. Her father is a teacher who has a grandiose vision of himself as a great writer (his work reads like a cheap paperback). Her mother is kind and pretty but a bit of an airhead. Caterina is trying to fit in at school. Does she belong with the Bohemians or with the rich socialites (think teenage Paris Hilton)?

It's a charming coming of age movie. I couldn't help but think that Italy has the same social and political divide as we do in America. I found it amusing some classmates called her a ""Hillbilly"". Back in Detroit in the '70s I knew a Sicilian who called himself an ""Italian Hillbilly"". I thought it was kind of funny but I bet he was called that as a kid. I think anyone who remembers being a teen will like this flick.",1155427200,4,820,4.256410256410256
8081161,4,B000AYELX8,"'Caterina va in citta' ('Caterina in the Big City') is an Italian film that takes as its storyline the coming of age of a young teenager transported by her family from the quiet Tuscany seaside village of Montaldo Di Castro to the challenging realities of Big City Rome, but that is only the means to an end of exploring Italian politico-social life and its effects on the youth of today.  It comes very close to drowning in its own excesses, but at the root of the film is a sensitive tale of a young girl's struggles with growing into an adulthood that puzzles, frightens and challenges her.

Caterina (Alice Teghil) finds her greatest moments of happiness in her home town singing mezzo soprano in the choir: simple pleasures in a simple setting surrounded by country folk content to live life day to day.  Her father Giancarlo (Sergio Castellitto) is a teacher who can't hold a job, partially because he is so outspoken and partially because he is a raving truly obnoxious person.  Her mother Agata (Margherita Buy) is subservient, a woman with few coping mechanisms who allows her odious husband to run an abusive household.  Giancarlo's aunt is ill in Rome and with the idea of finding a job where his talents are respected, Giancarlo uproots his little family and moves to the big city.  There the social castes are evident and Caterina is judged a country hick until she is befriended by first a rebel who bonds with Caterina, introduces her to tattoos and liquor, and causes a schism between her important mother (Giancarlo hoped to have is novel published by the woman), the daughter and his family.  Caterina then is absorbed into the rich and spoiled rank and file of the wealthy, not fitting in until the girls do a make over. That situation is again disrupted by Giancarlo's blindly inappropriate behavior. The true Caterina is somehow lost, still dreaming of becoming a fine mezzo soprano, but tagging along with the crowd du jour.  Ultimately Giancarlo's multiple and consistent failures drive him away from the family, he rides off to oblivion on his restored motorbike,  and Agata and Caterina both bloom.

The noise level of this film is such that it is difficult to watch: the young girls means of communication is a mixture of screaming, loud talking, and fighting and otherwise making us uncomfortable.  Yet underneath all of the political and social expose and brandishing is a truly wonderful young Caterina whose life as a soap opera is watched tenderly by an Australian boy who plays the guitar and observes her family from a window across the way from Caterina's Rome home.  The moments toward the end of the film when the playback comes justifies the fuss of getting there.

This is not a film this viewer would sit through again, but reflecting on the story after all the commotion is over, hearing Mozart's 'Ave Verum Corpus' and Verdi's 'Nabucco"" etc as the inspiration behind Caterina's honest dreams, makes is a more memorable experience. In Italian with English subtitles.  Grady Harp, July 06",1151712000,3,3027,4.841085271317829
8081162,3,B000AYELX8,"Caterina in a nutshell: a social climber husband who thinks he has the soul of a poet but really has the soul of a brutish cretin; a verbally abused wife with a friend on the side, their daughter, the new girl in the big city, courted and dropped by the cool clique; and the Australian boy in the apartment across the alley who watches that family soap opera drama while living his own.  This familiar theme movie is somewhat redeemed by the acting of the spirited Caterina and her mother.  Otherwise, it just barely slips into three star territory.",1145664000,2,549,4.5353535353535355
