7803426,5,6300174220,"This tape is dated, but it's a good workout.  It is low impact enough that I don't dread doing it, but it definitely gets my heart rate up. I had this tape  back when it first came out and lost it somewhere among my moves. I intentionally search for it online to repurchase it because I remembered it being a good workout that I was willing to do. It didn't disappoint me.",1490659200,,372,4.152777777777778
