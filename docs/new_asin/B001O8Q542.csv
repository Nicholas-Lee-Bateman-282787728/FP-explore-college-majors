The video does a great job explaining the process...",1392595200,,166,4.0606060606060606
8329971,3,B001O8Q542,"I really was hoping to learn the basics from this DVD and it was interesting to watch.  If you have never carved before DO NOT get this video.  During the actual carving they just play music, show the film in high speed and the camer anever seems to be in the right place and zoomed properly to see the details to learn.  They run the film at regular speed to talk about a few helpful hints and some joking around.  It left me VERY disappointed and now I am back out here looking for a beginners DVD again.  This would have been a GREAT DVD if the video would have had about three cameras with trained camera personel and properly editted.  I hope their next DVD is better quality.",1382054400,,681,4.24031007751938
