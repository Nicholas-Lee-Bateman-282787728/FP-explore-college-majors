7846415,5,6303439179,"Aladdin is one of my all-time favorite Disney films.  Not my favorite (that honor belongs to Beauty & the Beast), but it is my second favorite.  However, it would prove to be the best one to make a show out of.  Remember the Little Mermaid prequel show?  That was a boring show where any conflict was a foregone conclusion, and the new characters were boring, and the good ones never lived up to their potential.  My ""favorite"" was the episode with the cool new villain Evil Manta, voiced by Tim Curry.  How did they beat him?  Ariel sang a song about harmony, & he got zapped away in a pink flash. ?_!

This is the complete opposite.  It was an exciting show.  All your favorite characters from the movie were here except for Jafar, but that's okay.  He was never one of Disney's strongest villains I thought.  The villains in this series put him to shame.  Every episode had at least one interesting idea, or one (most likely more) laugh out loud moment.  I own every VHS tape of this series, & I'm going to review the episodes on every one of them.  Here's the episodes, with the summaries from the back of the box.

Getting the Bugs Out:  Aladdin takes all the credit for exterminating an army of destructive mechanical beetles!  But when a huge, tank-like mechanical bug thunders into Golden Village, will Aladdin realize one person doesn't make a Swat team?  This was the first episode I ever saw, & it's one of the best.  Mechanicles is probably my favorite villain in the series.  He is so hilarious I hurt myself laughing during every episode with him in it, even if I've seen it before.  Besides, those machines he makes are actually pretty cool.  A+

The Sands of Fate: Aladdin, Abu & Carpet are caught in the glow of a magic crystal & are doomed to repeat the fiercest of battles over & over & over!  Only Iago can stop this perpetual rerun by breaking the spell - without breaking the magic crystal!  This is another great episode.  The idea was interesting, & Groundhog Day loops are always entertaining in my book.  And to top it all off, Iago saves the day without it being his fault the day needs saving in the first place.  A+

I can't give this tape anything other than 5 stars.",1365120000,,2197,4.447236180904523
