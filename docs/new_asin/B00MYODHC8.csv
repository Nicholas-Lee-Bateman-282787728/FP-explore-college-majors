6604756,5,B00MYODHC8,"This Korean comedy-mystery in 20 episodes develops the characters of four rookie cops and their team leader. Crimes are solved but not always prevented as the rookies learn the detective trade. A murder mystery of the mother of one of the rookies lurks in the background and drives the main plot. This is a refreshing change from the formula -- no character development-- of US crime series. To go into detail would spoil the plots. The South Korean Broadcasting Co. show is getting harder to acquire but is featured on Dramafever, an online streaming service.
I initially bought a $15 version from Hong Kong but it merged all 20 episodes into one long feature and the quality is not so good--you get what you pay for.",1427673600,,718,4.7063492063492065

8675350,4,B00MYODHC8,"I've never bought a Korean drama before but was surprised when it arrived marked new (extremely well packaged for safety and marked fragile) in its celephaine wrap but had little disc inserts that made me think it was bootleg. The shipment arrived extremely fast and even came with a hand written thank you which I really appreciated. If this is the way they come then great! I'll be sure to change it to 5 stars. If not, it's kind of strange as the quality on my laptop seems to be a little low with some noise that reminds of a DVD rip. Just, curious about it as its my first Korean drama purchase.",1452297600,2,600,4.31858407079646
8675351,5,B00MYODHC8,"This show will make you laugh, make you cry and then satisfy your action itch. This is not one of those silly brainless comedies but thoughtful and witty. The show starts out with a mystery that slowly progresses throughout the show and along the way you will laugh and enjoy enjoy some awesome action scenes. There is no lag in the story plot and at the end you will wish there was more episodes. If you are a fan of K-drama then this is a MUST have to your collection.",1446076800,,470,4.233333333333333
8675352,4,B00MYODHC8,I liked this police procedural TV series. I was really surprised at who were the good guys and who were the bad. It is important to me that the main characters are people I would like to hang out with and most of these character are those kind of people.,1444176000,,254,4.1

8675356,5,B00MYODHC8,"Excellent. Creative storyline, and by the end of the series, you feel part of the family. Character development is far superior to US television--you find yourself laughing until your belly aches, and weeping with the characters when tragedy strikes. Love the soundtrack, too. Excellent quality, great subtitles in English. Much better than the highly rated ""Boys Over Flowers"" Korean mini series. This is one I will watch repeatedly.",1430870400,,434,5.397058823529412
