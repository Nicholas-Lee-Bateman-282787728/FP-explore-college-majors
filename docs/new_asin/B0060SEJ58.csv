4924077,5,B0060SEJ58,I wasn't sure if I was going to like it at first but when all the clues started to come together the light went on.  I drowned once as a child and was brought back to life by an unknown stranger that I never got to meet but knew that someone was out there somewhere always watching over me.  Everyone has a Guardian angel and it was interesting to see one depicted in this good versus evil flick that has a surprising end.,1360540800,2,422,4.072289156626506
4924078,2,B0060SEJ58,"Me parece una pelcula con muy bajo contenido,  psima produccin y ni que decir de los actores, directores no la recomiendo",1359504000,,121,4.761904761904762
4924079,5,B0060SEJ58,"This is a well written and directed movie. Fight scenes very convincing and choreographed. The on location shoot, great idea.",1352851200,2,125,5.3
4924080,4,B0060SEJ58,"I, too, picked the movie out by its description, as I was intrigued to see what would be done with the Everglades, which could have been so much more. On the other hand, that's probably the way it plays for those who go there.

I normally don't like action films, and probably would have felt disappointed had this come from a big studio. But I feel it was interesting as an admirable independent film effort. As the director said in the special features which you should watch afterward, it was a low-budget film made with a big-budget mindset, and, to tell you the truth, it did look very professional.

The plot was interesting, too, not quite what I would have expected. It wasn't what I would have wanted out of a studio movie, either, but had some redeeming angles that you don't usually see in an action film. It did reflect the male mindset, which seems to run to violence, and also a cultural mindset, which I was glad to see did not seem to embrace drug-running but rather universal truths.

I'd say give it an open mind. We're probably going to be hearing more from both director and star.",1336521600,,1100,4.49
4924081,3,B0060SEJ58,it was very good movie to see it was very good i love it and my wife too. Thank You,1334534400,,83,3.2
4924082,5,B0060SEJ58,"Una pelicula de mucha accion, agil y entretenida. Se pasa un rato agradable con esta bistoria desrrollada en los Everglades.",1330560000,,124,5.25
4924083,2,B0060SEJ58,"I rented this because i liked the description on the box (based in part on a true story that happened to the director). It's an ok little actioner with religious overtones, that could have benefited from being a little shorter. It's got nice stunts, the woodland setting is atmospheric and the actors do their jobs. On the downside, it begins to feel muddled and flat toward the end.",1329004800,,383,4.647058823529412
4924084,5,B0060SEJ58,This movie rocks!!! Great cast Sonia Smith is awesome and all the guys are super hot. loved this movie. I hope to see Jencarlos in more action films.,1328745600,,149,4.357142857142857
4924085,1,B0060SEJ58,Another movie for Jr High kids.,1472428800,,31,4.333333333333333
4924086,5,B0060SEJ58,"I really liked it. In a way, you almost knew what was going to happen but you just can't stop watching it to see for sure.",1466294400,,122,3.730769230769231
4924087,5,B0060SEJ58,Not a great or even good movie but come on who doesn't love to see Jencarlos shirtless.,1463184000,,87,4.176470588235294
4924088,3,B0060SEJ58,Okay movie,1461974400,,10,4.5
4924089,2,B0060SEJ58,Didn't like,1461715200,,11,5.0
4924090,1,B0060SEJ58,"I would give this minus stars if possible, or zero. It starts as a ""WWF in The Swamps? farce and turns into an endless kill fest with the most ridiculous dialogues ever written. And insultingly bad acting.",1461456000,,205,4.5675675675675675
4924091,5,B0060SEJ58,Great movie,1461024000,,11,5.0
4924092,3,B0060SEJ58,"If you suspend belief there is a decent action film here with authentic hand to hand combat, evil drug runners and three friends with differing views on God and morals. Fairly decent acting and production values. Think a poor man's Rambo with drug dealers doing the hunting instead of the military. This is a cut above the typical Prime included schlock. A touch of mysticism adds an element of interest.",1461024000,2,404,4.785714285714286
4924093,5,B0060SEJ58,"The movie starts out very strange and you're not sure what to make of it and what importance it has to the rest of the movie.  It fast forward many years and Brandon, played by Jencarlos Canela and his friends is at Brandon's house, getting ready to head out for a hunting trip together.  After drugs are found it is a fight for survival between the 3 friends and a gang of drug henchmen.  The story gains action as two of the 3 friends, Peter, and Jose, decide to go against Brandon's wishes to leave the drugs be and move on.  Peter and Jose see instant riches by stealing some of the drugs and the race for survival is on as they fight to survive through the Everglades in the night.  I don't want to give away the ending, however, it is a twist I had not seen coming and I was glad I watched until the end as everything came full circle and the entire message of the movie was made.  A must watch, you won't be disappointed in the ending.",1460160000,,942,4.148351648351649
4924094,1,B0060SEJ58,"If you are looking for mindless drivel in the form of awful cinematography, terrible writing, pathetic acting and even worse dialog, by all means watch Hunted By Night. Don't say you haven't been warned.",1458864000,,203,5.0
8490684,1,B0060SEJ58,"Movie is suck, director is suck and the bad girl suck harder, forward this to the director; you don't hold a assault rifle up right position, you have to be in crouch position and shoulders lean forward otherwise once you fire the weapon you can't even stand still and you will fire the bullet in the sky",1502064000,,304,4.350877192982456
8490685,5,B0060SEJ58,"Wow. This is one action-packed movie. This one guy must be an ex-marine and/or friends with John Claude van Damme !!
He kicks up a storm. His two buddies are weak. They could only shoot arrows. Hopefully in real life he will be more particular choosing his friends. He was mature. They weren't but, he stood by them to the end.",1493683200,,327,4.377049180327869
8490686,1,B0060SEJ58,Who knew people could fight for 35 minutes like a ninja after getting shot 12 times with 2 arrows in them! LOL Amazon should pay you to watch this garbage.,1489795200,,155,4.2
8490687,4,B0060SEJ58,"Had it not been for Paco exaggerating/overdoing it at the very end, it would've been a 5 star. Loved the Pastor at beginning and end. And The cross belonged to the young mother and placed on the baby, which is the only survivor at end of movie. The movie was very good, just over played by the Paco character.",1486512000,,309,4.254237288135593
8490688,4,B0060SEJ58,Good movie,1485820800,,10,4.5
8490689,1,B0060SEJ58,This movie sucked!!  A-team episodes from the 80's weren't even this bad.  Horrible acting and lots of silly action sequences with gratuitous use of slo-mo.  I only got a third of the way through it and called it quits.  Don't waste your time.,1485734400,,243,4.5813953488372094
8490690,4,B0060SEJ58,thanks for the movies,1484352000,,21,4.5
