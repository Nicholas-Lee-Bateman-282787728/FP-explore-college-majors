The selection of weapons are good and it is a great example of a film that is crying out for a full-blooded remake.",1293494400,,265,4.28
537112,4,6303025625,"Even if ""Ring of Steel"" were a very bad film (not so) and failed to rise above the stigmas of DTV moviemaking (also not so), you'd still have to give it credit for simply existing. I mean, how many movies then and now concern themselves with swordfighting? Sure, there are a mess of movies featuring swordplay, but with the exceptions of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Highlander/dp/B001JFZ118/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Highlander</a>&nbsp;and Eric Roberts'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/By-the-Sword/dp/6303139132/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">By the Sword</a>, virtually no film has built its premise around the art of sword combat. Not only does ""Ring of Steel"" do this, but it manages to retain respect for the sport in the midst of a very fun and surprisingly competent mid-'90s action flick. If you like low-budget features from this era but are tired of repetitious kickboxing pictures, then this ought to be a pleasant departure from the norm.

The story: Alex Freyer (Robert Chapin,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragon-Fury/dp/6303415520/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragon Fury</a>) is an up-and-coming star in the fencing world when he accidentally slays an opponent on his way to the championships. Blackballed from the sport, Alex believes his career to be over when he's contacted by a nameless man in black (Joe Don Baker,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Silence-of-the-Lambs/dp/B000LP6KNU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Silence of the Lambs</a>) who offers to make him a star in the world of illegal underground swordfighting. Intrigued at first but repelled by the antics of the out-of-control champion, Alex attempts to leave the competition, but this proves more difficult and dangerous than he had anticipated.

Following his writing of and starring in this movie, Robert Chapin pursued a handful of small parts in small movies but would eventually settle down as a stuntman and visual effects artist for mainstream blockbusters. It's nice that he's still got a career, but it's also a shame that he could never follow up on anything as fun or physical as when he wielded a rapier and took on guys with broadswords, katanas, cutlasses, and sabers. Where his character is concerned, he makes the movie work without playing the dummy, but from the physical side of things, his work is even better. Credit also goes to master swordswoman Jan Bryant, who choreographed the numerous matches and also had a hand in the swashbuckling content of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Army-of-Darkness/dp/0783227434/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Army of Darkness</a>, as well as to the awesome opponents Chapin has in Jim Pirri (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Perfect-Target/dp/6305609292/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Perfect Target</a>), James Lew (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Balance-of-Power/dp/6304371128/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Balance of Power</a>), American Gladiator Deron McBee (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat-Annihilation/dp/0780622057/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat: Annihilation</a>), and Gary Kasper (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Escape-From-Alaska/dp/B0000633RY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Escape From Alaska</a>) as the insane, katana-wielding champion.

The swordfighting is the rightful highlight, with at least nine cool encounters to show off various styles of fencing, but the acting isn't too shabby either. Chapin is respectable as a short-lived action hero and manages to build a surprisingly endearing on-screen relationship with fellow fencer Darlene Vogel (""Pacific Blue""), who later gets kidnapped to keep Alex in the tournament. Joe Don Baker proves versatile in his role: he walks a fine line between villain and benefactor, often coming off as despicable in one scene and saving someone's life in the next; kudos to him for making the very most of his part. Co-stars Jim Pirri and Gary Kasper didn't have too many large roles outside of this film, but prove steadfast in their portrayals. The only disappointing performance comes from beautiful villainess Carol Alt (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thunder-in-Paradise/dp/B000GNOSD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thunder in Paradise</a>), who's responsible for some of the more illogical exchanges in the movie.

If the movie has a glaring fault, it's the relative shallowness that defies the cool fights and better-than-average acting: with a bit more gravity, ""Ring of Steel"" might've managed to snag the cult status that has unjustly eluded it thus far, because casual viewers won't necessarily keep too much of the film in mind after the credits roll. Short of needing a bit more ""oomph"" to go with its ""ahh"", the movie is one of top finds I've come across in my wadings through action flicks of the era, and I wholeheartedly suggest it to anyone willing to give something new a try.",1249171200,,5210,6.679941002949852
537113,4,6303025625,"For a title that I was totally unfamiliar with and actors I have not heard of, Ring of Steel turned out to be better than the typical B-grade swordsfight/martial arts action film.  All the actors do a good job of never overacting, which is just too common in these types of films.  The action is choreographed well.  There is even some humor thrown in that is actually humurous for a change.  The story is nothing impressive, though there are elements of suspense to it here and there with a few small surprises.

The best thing I liked about Ring of Steel is the underground fight locale.  The scene in the beginning of the film takes us from the entrance to a dance club on the streets, and from there practically by footstep to eventually the illegal gambling arena.  It gave me a feeling that I was actually there and no other such movie that I have seen before gave me that feeling.  The fighters are pretty decent and the whole gig reminded me of American Samurai, though not as violent and thankfully, not as overdramatic in the acting department.  There are lots of fights in Ring of Steel, though none overly impressive.

I thoroughly enjoyed Ring of Steel, especially because I was expecting a 2 star film at the best.  Everything is done adequately, but nothing stuck out as being very impressive.  The music kept a sense of cheesiness throughout much of the movie that could have been avoided and provided a more intenseful atmosphere.  But overall, this movie doesn't disappoint, especially if you like a good arena with fight matches and swordsplay.",1158019200,,1563,4.681318681318682
537114,4,6303025625,"This tape has 3 different workouts.
The first one is the one I actually use, it is pretty challenging and is great for spot conditioning; it covers the outer thighs, inner thighs and back of thighs.
The second and third workouts need a chair and a step respectively, and i really don't like the chair one (to hold balance) because it really hurts your knees! and the step one is just unconfortable sitting on it.
One thing i really don't like is the cheesy atmosphere and music; and tamilee's outfit is very scary, and they are always focusing on her butt, but she talks to you in a very friendly way, which gives it positive points, and you don't really feel like just turning it off like other trainers.",1037664000,,705,4.4728682170542635

537116,4,6303025625,"This is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and enjoy it every time. Robert Chapin wrote the screenplay and portrays Alex, a young fencing champion whose rising star is felled by tragedy during a  pivotal tournament. Alex is drawn into the dark world of illegal fight  clubs. Chapin is engaging as well as re-assuring, mixing Alex's naivete  with impressive fighting skills. Jim Pirri puts in an energetic and  sympathetic performance as Brian, a fight club champion who befriends Alex.  If you are into action, especially action involving swordplay, you'll want  to make use of the slow motion feature on your VCR during many of the  scenes. The actors perform their own fights, something I love to see. One  of my all-time favorite swordfight scenes ever is the inspired duel between  Brian and Alex. You have to see it to believe it!",951177600,5,859,4.789115646258503

And I love her no-nonsense delivery too, no incessant mindless chatter. Just great pleasant instruction and all exercises pretty easy to do. And better than that Tamilee offers solid no bull****, instruction on form and position. WONDERFUL. Beg, steal or borrow a copy of this and any of the STEEL series. And forget the rest.

7835030,5,6303025625,"Since the early 90's the action B market has had a very profound affect on our lives. In fact it reigned down blows upon us with such great force that we have never been able to shake it. There is something to be said for these low budget movies that would never be shown before 12 am on an given evening. Essential they are cinematic perfection, through their non-stop flaws, for the right type of viewer. With our years of experience, we've found one factor that remains consistent with any good 90's action B.....MULLETS. Whenever you have many small mullets or one huge mullet, the film will be amazing 100% of the time. 60% of the time it works every time. In Ring of Steel we were introduced to a mullet so glorious that it could go head to head with Chuck Norris' mullet from 1993. This thing clearly contained the power of ten men. Outside of the mullet factor was the clear parallels to the B of all B's, the immortal, incomparable...DEATH RING. It was obvious the writer caught Death Ring the same night we did back in 94 and utilized the same general premise.

Ring of Steel opens up in a high school gym as a ""world class"" fencing tournament is going on. Oh yeah, this movie is centered around fencing. Bet you didn't see that one coming. Our main star Alex is possible the worlds greatest fencer and is a mirror image of Matt Collins. As Alex competes for champion of the universe, he accidentally stabs his opponent through the eye killing him on the spot. From here he goes into total loser depression mode, just like Matt Collins, questioning the path of his life. The only thing missing was the batting cages where he rants about the lamest whimpiest geeks of the planet. One night Alex finds himself about to be mugged until a mysterious man rescues him. The man known as ""the man in black"" recruits Alex to be part of his underground fighting ring. Once Alex decides this Ring of Steel is too mental he takes off. But wait a minute our golden mulleted hero...not so fast. The man in black pulls a Denton Vachs and kidnaps Alex's woman forcing him to fight for their lives. Obviously Alex winds up victorious in a burning roof battle with some white swordsman with an awesome ponytail.

Ring of Steel is yet another fine example of the perfect 90's B action premise. A lacking story with lots of overacting and superior mullets will always land you a 5 star event. Anytime you base your film off of the Death Ring premise also will only lead you to victory. A very smart move by casting the main role to be a duplicate of Mike Norris...just swap out the flat top with a mullet. It even had a brief cameo from the fat bouncer in Roadhouse...the guy that was a dead ringer for Christian. Yeah the same Christian that body slammed himself onto a picnic bench leading to its ultimate demise. We weren't even aware of any film that's main premise was centered around fencing. Who would have thought? All we can say is you must see Ring of Steel as soon as possible. Somehow this even made it to DVD. Not sure where the demand for DVD came from, but we'll take it.",1335139200,,3076,4.442477876106195
