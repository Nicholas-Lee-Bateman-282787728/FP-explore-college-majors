8202587,5,B000RW3Z1M,"I'm pretty inflexible and know that when I do a stretching routine I feel a lot better and have a lot less trouble with my back.  Getting a core workout was a bonus!

I really like the stretch part of this DVD -- her explanations are good and the camera work shows what to do.  I like the core routine, too -- but I'll be honest that there are some of the exercises that I just can't do.  I guess I was more out of shape than I thought.  For now, I just skip those parts and concentrate on the ones I can do.  A nice thing about this workout is that you don't need any equipment -- just an old towel and a carpeted floor, rug or a mat.

I bought four DVDs at about the same time, and do different routines on different days, typically some each of the stretching, core/Pilates and knees about 5 days a week.  It's been a month, and there is a difference in how I feel . . . and my husband says also in how I look and move.  I'd recommend any or all of the four I got -- they each have a little different workout:

8202588,5,B000RW3Z1M,"I love this video.  I use the stretch routine after workouts or anytime I feel I need a thorough stretching out.  It is not difficult and you feel good afterwards.  She really emphasizes the hamstrings and hips which are resposible for so much low back pain, but this is a head to toe stretch in about 25 minutes.  Breathing into the stretch is also given consistent attention, really helpful.

The ab workout routine is quite challenging and is very good prep for Pilates or general fitness - if you can keep up with Jeannette on this one, you're doing really well. For the rest of us, she structures things so you can move at your own pace using beginner versions of the exercises.

I did notice on the stretch exercises the camera has reversed left and right somehow - but you can just follow what Jeanette says, not the side she appears to be working on in the video...

Great video - use it all the time",1226275200,,908,4.401197604790419
8202589,5,B000RW3Z1M,"I suffer from hip problems, so am always looking for a good stretching routine that doesn't involve advanced yoga moves, since I am not that flexible. Up to now, my favorite was the 20min ""Yoga Stretch"" routine on Karen Voight's ""Slim Physique"" DVD. It has very relaxing music and is great to do late at night. But I was looking for an alternative that wasn't so relaxing, and bought this Hollywood Trainer DVD to compare.

This DVD is fantastic - a really good athletic stretch that leaves you feeling great afterwards. Most of the leg stretches are done with a strap (or a towel) and are a good length. Jeanette talks a bit loudly (she seems to forget she's using a mic) but I was looking for an alternate to the soothing voice and music atmosphere anyway so it was okay with me. (Just be warned that it won't make you sleepy...) If you know a wide range of stretches, you can substitute or modify a few here and there as needed.

Since I was only looking for a good stretch, the ""Core"" routine was a wonderful bonus. It's a solid ab workout (about 20mins) with lots of variety and a good pace. I like that it also includes a few minutes of back exercises. Overall, one of the very best ab workouts I have (and I own a few DVDs of ""10-minute ab workouts"" that I don't care for much).

The DVD is set up that you can start with the CORE workout and it moves into the STRETCH automatically, but keep the DVD remote handy so you can skip the two sections that introduce all the other participants in the room. I'm sure the producers thought it was a nice friendly thing to do, but (1) I don't care who is in the room with Jeanette and (2) I certainly don't wish to hear their life stories every time I want to work out. What were they thinking? This stuff should have been in an optional ""bonus"" section for people who are curious.

Incidentally, the title of the DVD I received was ""Core & Stretch It Out"", in case you see it elsewhere.

I also bought the ""AM/PM Stretch"" DVD (the PM is good enough, the AM is very tame - it might wake you up but that's about it).",1202169600,6,2064,4.255102040816326
8202590,5,B000RW3Z1M,"I love Jeanetts Jenkins way of teaching, she keeps it simple but makes it fun. The Video has two 30 minute workouts. The first workout is for the core, this workout is easy to follow but very effective. The second workout is 30 minutes stretching, it makes you feel awesome afterwards.",1195689600,5,285,4.607843137254902
