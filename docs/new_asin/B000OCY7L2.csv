2793322,4,B000OCY7L2,"Ironically, The Exterminating Angels seems to be a critique on making sexually explicit and arousing films, but at the same time it certainly is one.  It just so happens to be the highest quality of its ilk that I've seen since perhaps The Dreamers.  Looking briefly at other recent movies that The Exterminating Angels may be compared to (i.e. 9 Songs, Shortbus) it isn't as graphic and it strictly involves female sexuality and nudity.  There is a massive amount of nudity in The Exterminating Angels, but only a few shots go over the line in terms of acceptable content in mainstream American films.  Some angles in The Exterminating Angels show absolutely every part of the actresses' bodies.  I felt it was justified given the fundamentally sexual subject matter and there were actually many opportunities in this movie to show even more nudity but it didn't, so I'm not sure we can definitely call it gratuitous.  It definitely would've been a lesser film without it, and I mean that as both a stern critic and as a libidinous male.

The Exterminating Angels is about Franois, a filmmaker who needs to find several uninhibited actresses who are not afraid to appear in his explicit semi-improvisational film.  He wants actresses and not porn stars because porn stars have been there and will not transfer effectively to his vision of taboos and unexplored female sexuality.  In other words, the actresses have not been exploited yet and that is what he wants to show.  We get the feeling that Francois is a very serious filmmaker.

Franois is visited by his dead Grandmother in the middle of the night and she warns him of the future.  As Franois begins his search for the right actresses, he comes across a girl who willingly experiences a real climax at her audition, and it is her first time ever.  Franois requested she fake it but she went right ahead anyway and explained that she did it because the idea of doing so in this setting is what turned her on.  Franois, fascinated by this exchange, decides to explore why this happens.  But he never chose that girl for a part in his film, so he essentially and unwittingly used her.  He does eventually get the appropriate actresses and relationships with them develop and trust issues surface in no time.  One of them even falls in love with Franois but he doesn't know anything about this, as to him he's just making a movie.  Being behind the camera is a loveless experience to him but being in front of it is an incredibly intense sexual exploration to his actresses, and they are not stable people to begin with.

There were also two apparitional girls that indicate no longer being angels, but not quite witches yet either who follow Franois around.  One of them even helps to originally persuade one of the three actresses to approach Franois about a role in the film.  In the end they seem to both be conflicted about what Franois has done to these girls.  That element coupled with the extra random and surreal dialogue that accompanies some of the more unnatural scenes perplexed me a bit.  There are certainly some aspects that were artier than I think they needed to be but perhaps I need to see the film again.  Also, I can't help but think this is a self-indulgent effort from director Jean-Claude Brisseau.  Taking that into account it does come off as a bit pompous, and the near accusations I have that Brisseau is guilty of some pretentious elements is certainly consistent with that.  All of that aside, this is still a fiercely determined and erotic film that is well done, brave, and provoking on many levels.",1186531200,47,3589,4.711538461538462
2793332,4,B000OCY7L2,"At least I think it's French. A lot of soft-core lesbian play. The whole thing has a real feel to it. We have a bevy of attractive, but not drop-dead gorgeous women with big fake boobies, doing girl-girl things. But are they doing it because they're into it? Or are they doing it to entice him? They seem to do anything he asks, so what is this control he has over them? I won't spoil it, but it's revealed in a meeting late in the film. As for the angels, I'm not so sure. They save him from being beaten to death, but at what price? If you like soft-core, artsy flicks this isn't half bad.",1459814400,,591,4.103448275862069

The idea was that they would be paired with other women but they were not lesbians. The film was very well done and I do not see for one minute why it could even come close to porn as some reviews would have you believe. A very well done French film that is well worth watching.

2793376,2,B000OCY7L2,"Les Anges Exterminateurs (Exterminating Angels) (Jean-Claude Brisseau, 2006)

I had entirely forgotten, until something on the IMDB boards nudged my memory, that I had watchedand not been entirely thrilled withone of Jean-Claude Brisseau's earlier pictures, Choses Secrtes, back in 2008. There is a great deal of conjecture on the IMDB message boards that Les Anges Exterminateurs is Brisseau's response to charges of harassment filed against him during the making of that film. (I also saw allegations that similar charges were filed against him during the making of this one, but found no verification for this.) While my research, ragtag as it was, was able to neither confirm nor deny any of this, it can't be denied that this movie feels autobiographical, but then you have to take into account that any film a filmmaker makes about a filmmaker making a film is going to feel autobiographical, especially when the filmmaker in the film is making the kind of film the real-life filmmaker makes. Now, go back and try to say all that five times fast. In one breath.

Plot: a director, Franois (A Tale of Winter's Frdric van den Dreissche), sets out to make a new film. (We think, anyway.) He begins interviewing actresses and, in these interviews, pushes them farther and farther erotically. Is he really interested, as he tells them, in pushing the boundaries of the erotic, or is he just getting a thrill from watching them play with themselves (and, sometimes, each other)? Eventually, he starts focusing on two of the women, Charlotte (Au milieu de la Nuit's Maroussia Dubreuil) and Julie (The Girl from Nowhere's Lisa Bellynck). But then... what does his wife (Saint-Jacques...La Mecque's Marie Allan) think about all this?

It continues to amaze me that people can make porn filmsor, in this case, films that border on porn without ever quite getting thereand still manage to have the final product be a bore. It would be easy (and accurate, judging by lor_'s review of the film on IMDB, which includes information from a director Q&A confirming the sexual harassment/response allegation) to pass that off as the innate inferiority of memoir, and looking back most porn-like substances I've come across that have bored me to tears have been of that variety. (100 Strokes of the Brush Before Bed, anyone?) But there's an added level of pretentiousness here that also applies; I'm not sure whether I should be applauding Brisseau for having had the hubris to use a trope from Orphe or to backhand him, like so many other reviewers have done, for the shameless rip-off. The answer may lie in the question; would anyone but the greatest purist be taking him to task for attempting it if he's actually pulled it off? Taking a tangent from there, arthouse porn is still porn (if you're more ashcan than academic, you may want to look at this from the perspective that arthouse porn is still arthouse; either squinty-eyed view of this crossover is equally valid). While I would never claim to be an authority on the subject, it has always seemed to me that attempts to make arthouse porn are by default attempts to legitimize pornography as an artistic medium (think Winterbottom's 9 Songs here). There should be some argument about whether such legitimization is needed, even if that argument is fading the farther we get away from the days when the film half of the adult film genre was just as important. But the legitimizing aspect here has a much darker background given the film's memoir qualities; it can be argued that Brisseau is not attempting to legitimize the pornier aspects of his film as much as he is attempting to legitimize the sexual harassment that spawned the script for this movie. My relatively high rating for the movie, which stems entirely from my appreciation of gratuitous nudity on a movie screen, should tell you that I am at least attempting to give Brisseau the benefit of the doubt here, and my conclusion that any attempts to legitimize sexual harassment to be found here were unconscious on Brisseau's part. If I ever find out that is not the case, I'll be revising the rating on this to zero. **",1396569600,,4132,4.874822190611664

2793435,2,B000OCY7L2,"Many miss that this film is an open letter to the film industry... Brisseau had issues after his first erotic film and chose the self-indulgent path of telling that story in his next one.  It was intended to redeem Brisseau in the eyes of his peers and any future aspiring actresses, and in my view that's where the story ends.

Attempting to find the artistic or plot-driven value of this film will only leave you disappointed and I don't think anything is gained by looking for deeper merit where there isn't any. Choses Secretes was by contrast actually pretty good as a film... This is only worthwhile as an open letter. It should be a DVD extra on the Choses Secretes disc.

There's a lot of inexplicable nonsense in this which I believe was added in order to make it seem like more of a movie and distract from what otherwise feels a lot like a documentary (even though quite a lot of license is taken with the truth of what happened to Brisseau). I'm referring of course to the fallen angels themselves, and the manifestation of Franois' grandmother both of which seem to be extremely pointless.

It is of course possible to do Brisseau's work for him yourself and imagine many reasons for their inclusion in the film, but none of those are adequately indicated in the film itself, so you're always left wondering WTF Brisseau was actually thinking.

In the end, almost every woman featured in the film becomes obsessed with Brisseau's alter-ego Franois, despite him being perhaps the most obtuse man ever to try to understand a woman's feelings. Of course Brisseau himself is nothing like that but in this open letter, he wants us to believe that his naive ignorance is what absolves him of any responsibility.

If you liked Choses Secretes as I did, you may wish to watch this open letter. The experience will be made just bearable by the smattering of erotic scenes and the stunningly beautiful shapes made by Maroussia Dubreuil and Marie Allan's naked bodies. I can't get quite as enthused about Lise Bellynck unfortunately.

Imagine if a utility company included two fine chocolates with your itemised usage summary and you could indulge yourself on those while reading a bunch of boring statistics about electricity usage.

2793471,3,B000OCY7L2,"The erotic scenes were done really well. I like that they happened within the context of a story. I just wish it were a different story. It just seemed like everybody loses in the end. A couple of fallen angels are stearing the course of events in this film, but it's not clear what their motives are. Why are they involved? Why do they care about any of the things that are happening? What do they hope to gain by hurting the characters?

The characters, for the most part, are likable enough to follow them through the movie. The protagonist is 'the model man' for a story. He's good looking, confident, and he has status. The women who work with him are attracted to him but his eyes are focused on his work, the very work that gives him his identity and status in the first place. The women are likable. They get along with each other well. They are sexually adventerous and they have interesting back stories. It is somewhat of a downer that their bonding to each other is mostly through him, but it's probably more realistic that way. The movie takes a turn for the worst toward the end, when the character flaws of the women cause the whole ship to sink.

One good thing about the sinking ship is that it shines a spotlight on white knighting and shows just how ignorant and thuggish such behavior really is. We see the protagonist getting arrested and assaulted despite the fact that he remained on his best behavior, and yet everyone close to him thinks that everything that happens is his fault, even though all the women who interacted with him were adults who had complete control over themselves. Yet, in the blue pill world, he's the agent that acts, and the women are objects who are acted upon. The problem, though, is that the spotlight wasn't bright enough. But of course it's an erotic movie, and a more bold criticism of gender interractions would have gotten in the way of that. Perhaps the tragic plot should have been its own movie, while the well done erotic parts should be put in a more positive story. For example, I liked that Stephanie and Charlot were falling in love with each other, but instead of that pairing blooming into something wonderful, it only serves as a tool for one of the girls to control and manipulate the other one, at a point when the latter is vulnerable, against the protagonist.",1356739200,,2331,4.534441805225653

The film is in French; loosely subtitled 95% of the time into English.  One hour and forty minutes of softcore exploitation of women, who expose themselves with subdued expression and / or restrained emotion; unable to completely ignore their nervousness of being part of such a film.  I wasn't sure just what this film would be like, and before the halfway point I decided I wasn't the intended audience.  You might be though, if you're less nave than I was; or more progressive and embracing of any and all lifestyle experiences.  Somehow this violates the sacred gift shared between two human beings in a completely different format; not really porn (softcore or hardcore) and not really art or educational either.  I'm not sure what this is meant to inspire or encourage from the viewer - there doesn't seem to be any point IMHO, it seems like I'm watching through a keyhole while an unabashed voyeur sits in the room and watches a quite mild exchange between women in bed together, but never really gets with it.  This film definitely delivers more than what I anticipated - I wouldn't call this a ""fun"" film, and it CAN'T be intended to be all that stimulating.  France released this film in 2006 and it has been compared to 1999's ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" the latter not having been at the Seville film festival of 2006.

2793493,3,B000OCY7L2,"Director Jean-Claude Brisseau seems to be using this movie to proclaim his innocence after being on the sticky end of a fair amount of criticism following his first ""female masturbation movie"" Choses Secrets. So here he's showing us what went on behind the camera, supposedly, and telling us that really he's been misunderstood and wrongly accused. Well, I suppose if you can get a budget for what is essentially a 100+ minute essay on ""why I'm really a nice guy"" then more power to you.

French movies, in years gone by, often seemed to be on the edge of tipping over into self-indulgence and wilful obscurantism. Sad to say, this movie is guilty of the same thing. In a way you can almost imagine it inspired by Peter Greenaway - though there's none of Greenaway's elaborate framing, just his penchant for obscure symbolism.

Perhaps the biggest problem with the film is that it is pursuing the director's own personal obsession with female sexuality in much the same way as Choses Secrets (and later A l'Aventure) without actually developing beyond what was explored in the earlier film. Yes, it's charming to watch pretty women masturbate and Brisseau is to be commended for seeing sexuality as something potentially ecstatic and mystical, rather than merely mundane. But he explores this trope relentlessly through the narrow passageway of female masturbation and in the end the corridor is simply too narrow to enable him to develop his theme adequately. Although it seems difficult to imagine in the abstract, the fact is that after a while the repetition is simply boring. The director lacks the breadth and depth of vision necessary to move beyond the obvious. In the end it feels like we're watching a big-budget art school project where the ambition is much greater than the talent available.",1303862400,32,1803,4.947194719471947

There are bunch of things to see in this film which I can say this film is erotic to certain levels buy ususally the type sexual scenes done in this film is between females, it is all up to the audience to decide what to say about this meaning lesbian sex (which doesn't looks too much like one as found in film book of revelation where one of the woman wearing a latex dick to perform penetration on another woman.

The movie leaves a lot open for personal interpretation (i.e. did the girl angels hang around watching because they were lesbian angels? Was one of the angels really in love with the guy?)

2793508,5,B000OCY7L2,"This is the second of Jean Claude Brisseau's trilogy of erotic tales. The camera work is again extraordinary as it was in Secret Things and l'aventure.

The story is about a film maker making a documentary on the female climax. The interviews for prospective models adds a very light and comic turn to the movie. However, as in his other films, there is always a sense of foreboding that it is all going to go wrong somewhere. As much as he tries to stay above and removed from the eroticism of his models, and professes to care only about the film project, there is increasingly the suspicion that this is a tragedy and not a comedy. The mystic or metaphysical element that is always in Brisseau's films is very mcuh present in ""Angels"". He seems to be stalked by fallen angels that only the audience can see but that can whisper in his ear to influence him. They quite clearly mean him no good.

Watch for scenes as the one where he poses two of the girls by an open door with only the light from the hotel hallway and instructs one to make the other come again. The beautiful indirect light on their bodies makes the whole scene much sexier and more erotic. Fabulous camera work. Oh yes, you may be wondering. The models are all very attractive with sensational bodies. There is full nudity and more lesbian play than boy girl scenes, as the girls help each other out achieving climaxes for the camera.

Clearly this is a full step above almost anything else you might have seen in this genre. Brisseau proves again that he can tell a story, create dramatic tension with his characters, while creating eroticism. It is in French with English subtitles and everyone acts their parts extremely well.",1267660800,3,1700,4.567213114754098

However, this has much better production values and the girls are (arguably) of better quality. (Sorry, gals, there's no male nudity to get in the way of the male viewers' delight.)

The positive rating for this film I give if for the clean, color-filled visuals, including a couple strikingly lit nude scenes (I admit it -- I'm weak). Acting is okay. I found the dialog, even if it is in a language I don't speak, no more than functional.
