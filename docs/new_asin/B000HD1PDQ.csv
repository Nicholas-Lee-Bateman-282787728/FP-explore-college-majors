8138648,5,B000HD1PDQ,"A genius! One who had an open path to share his ability to make the imagined real through radio broadcast...and beyond. They have captured the man at work; directing a broadcast, coaching actors we've seen on the screen, and  there's so much more...so very well done.",1427414400,,267,4.804347826086956

8138650,5,B000HD1PDQ,Now I know one of Bob Fass' main influences. It was this guy. Listen to Radio Unnameable (Thurs/Fri Midnight wbai.org) and learn why the spirit of Norman Corwin still graces the radio airwaves.,1425513600,,193,4.878787878787879
8138651,5,B000HD1PDQ,"I'm pretty old so therefore a big Jack Parr fan over Johnny Carson, part of the reason being his guests were so very much more interesting and literate.  I am ashamed to say that I was not familiar with Corwin, he being brilliant and uncensored in the early days of CBS radio.  Although uncensored (which today sadly means using a bunch of cuss words and telling crude jokes) he addressed all important issues of his time poetically and with truth as he knew it.  I am a conservative and did not always agree with Parr and perhaps not with Corwin on all of their political views but I hugely respect both men's opinions and listen to them intently.  I also love Amazon's William Buckley series, his debate on capital punishment with Truman Capote is classic.",1419552000,,758,4.592592592592593
8138652,5,B000HD1PDQ,Yet another great documentary on Norman Corwin.,1408752000,,47,5.857142857142857
8138653,5,B000HD1PDQ,"I was raised on a farm in Oklahoma back in the 50's. Radio was my lifeline to the rest of the world (much to parents late night consternation). I remember shows like the ones Corwin did but I don't remember hearing any of his back then. I've listened to many of them recently and they are awe inspiring. The voices of the great actors of the day. Jimmy Stewart was just as good on the radio as in the movies. It reached your imagination. You were not a passive acceptor of what they were presenting you had to engage your mind to visualize what was happening. Find recordings, turn the lights off and listen.",1384992000,4,608,4.342105263157895
