2680817,5,B000JYXX7E,"I have to admit, I borrowed this from the library not really expecting much....The name was a little goofy and the cheesy picture on the front made me think it might not be something that would be for me, but I tried it and I couldn't have been more wrong.

The cuing on the moves is very good.  Both instructors show good form and give you modifications where they might be necessary.  The set includes one dvd for core exercises and one for the booty.  Both were excellent and mixed some pilates and yoga moves.  I thought the instructors were upbeat but not over the top.  Encouraging but not hyper.

I would probably do the two segments together to make about a 50 minute workout, but when I was pressed for time I did one and some toning exercises with another dvd that was short to round out my workout.

I would definitely seek out more dvds from these two instructors.  They know their stuff and show you you can't judge a dvd by it's cover.

Overall a good dvd that I would consider purchasing.",1298505600,,1003,4.372972972972973
2680818,3,B000JYXX7E,"Well, actually this is my first amazon review ever :) I got this dvd from my local library and just finished the abs section. I am a pretty fit person and I feel that some of the moves are good while others really don't seem too helpful. It just didn't quite take me to the next level. So if you are in pretty good shape and have done intermediate core workouts before, this one is an ok addition for a lighter workout.",1259280000,,419,4.121951219512195
2680819,5,B000JYXX7E,"This is my 5th written review on the YBB seris. I love YBB so much because Teigh and Gillian inspire you to be the best goddess that you can be, and their workouts are so fun it doesn't feel like your workingout. Trust me though after you are done with the workouts you will feel pretty sore and get some great results!

Godess Booty begins with the regular mudra/kudilingi yoga, some warm up stretches for the buns, thighs, and back. You do some leg lifts (like in pilates) with the foot turned in making it so you target the thigh and glute area. The frog, which after the leg lifts will really target you buns and you will feel the burn. Then you do a few more leg lifts ( differnt varity of course)some ballet that will target the booty area, fallowed by some strecths that feel really good after working so hard on your buns. Finally you end off with another mudra and your done working on your booty! (25 mins)

Yoga Core is a seris of Pilates exercises that will stregthen your core and slim/tone it down. You will see moves like swimming,half moon pose on the floor, bicycele and teasers. You also tone your internal organs later on in this dvd and do some stretchs for the abs and end with a mudra. 30 mins total...

YBB is a program that has worked really well for me. Teigh and Gillian have keeped me very motivated. If your not seeing results after doing this dvd, then it means your not working to your best potiental or at a high intesity...You should see results no matter at what fitness level you are at...",1247270400,,1523,4.355633802816901
2680820,5,B000JYXX7E,"I've owned several YBB workouts in the past and have enjoyed them all. I bought the Master's Series to have a set of shorter workouts for the days I'm pressed for time. I thought I was pretty strong when it came to yoga, but the Yoga Core workout humbled me. I couldn't complete all the poses, but Teigh and Gillian offers good variations if you are not up to the advanced moves. I felt sore the next day, but it was a good feeling. I felt I'd actually accomplished something rather than going through the motions. The Goddess Booty workout is a great way to target that area, which for me is a definite problem spot.

I recommend also getting the A.M. Latte and Goddess Abs Master Series DVDs. I look forward to working out with these dvd's and my boyfriend actually has to convince me to take a day off every now and then.
I gave this product five stars because, for me, it is a perfect workout combination. I enjoy the yoga meditations and do not notice any religious overtones. Some people have a problem with the perkiness of the instructors, but I find them motivating. I could see my self wanting to hang out and have coffee with these people. For me that is a real plus.",1238976000,,1178,4.3545454545454545
2680821,5,B000JYXX7E,"i bought this dvd after buying the yoga booty ballet beginners set and some of the LIVE dvds. i lost as much weight as i had wanted to, but i gained SO much more. i gained confidence and acceptance of myself and my body. i realized no matter what the scale said i was worth it, just like they told me in the beginning! i absolutely love Teigh and Gillian. sure they talk alot and they goof off, but come on, who wants to workout to silence? not i! they are motivational and inspiring. if you don't follow (or believe in) their mantras or poses or intentions, its okay to still do the workouts. they still make you feel beautiful and worth it. i felt as if they really wanted me to let go, have fun, and enjoy it as much as they do. now, i would buy ANY workout they sold! if you're a little skeptical, its still worth giving it a shot. go ahead, YOU""RE WORTH IT!!!",1229385600,,864,4.118343195266272
2680822,4,B000JYXX7E,"... that is, if you don't take yourself or the instructors too seriously.  Folks who are generally unfit will find the balancing poses demanding and probably won't have the stamina for this workout, but for those with a bit more strength and endurance it is a challenge and quite fun.  The women in the video are a somewhat odd combination of typical peppy aerobics instructors (""Eight more!"") with some mumbo-jumbo about finding your center and claiming your inner beauty, and they intersperse yoga terms without really explaining them.  Their best advice was about the satisfaction of working hard to achieve your fitness goals, and with that in mind, doing this workout regularly will definitely enhance one's core strength and gluteal muscles.",1221264000,,747,5.1570247933884295
2680823,4,B000JYXX7E,"I've got my young daughter doing it with me and we are having a BALL!
Seriously, if there's someone in your family whom you want to connect to, but aren't sure how, just do some YBB together!  ANYONE can do it--you can make it harder or easier depending on who you follow on the video.  So grab your 90-year old granny and your 8-year old kid and huddle in the TV room for some FAMILY BOOTY BALLET!  A good way to bring people together while working off that donut you ate after picking the kids up from school (I went to Fractured Prune for my donut today--it was hot and fabulous!).",1220832000,,584,4.243243243243243
2680824,5,B000JYXX7E,I was very pleased with how fast I received this product. The shipping was great. I love YBB so any DVD they put out I have to have. I don't do the tapes as often as I should but when I do them I definately notice a difference in my body.,1209513600,,238,3.6862745098039214
2680825,4,B000JYXX7E,"Yoga Booty Ballet is sometimes kind of cheesy, but the moves are effective. The women may grate some people's nerves because of their mantras or because their personalites are a little out there. There is one moment where one of the ladies gives the other stink eye and their deep breathing close ups are... interesting. Once you get past all that the moves are doable and worthwhile. I used this DVD as a followup to a more strenous one. The time flies through this one because everything is pretty succinct.",1205798400,,509,4.666666666666667
2680826,2,B000JYXX7E,"the ballet and yoga section is ok, as for the dance section their choregraphy is terrible some of the moves are ridiculous.  Don't buy if you are interested in the dance part.",1196467200,,175,4.46875
2680827,5,B000JYXX7E,"Excellent product!  Like the first one, it can be challenging but also spiritual and very motivating! You can put several segments together to customize your own workout for time and needs. I love them!",1194480000,,202,4.9411764705882355
2680828,5,B000JYXX7E,"I tried Yoga Booty Ballet Latin & Easy DVDs & felt the toning section was too easy & the dancing had too silly moves. I love Teigh McDonough from her Yoga Fusion Abs & Power videos that incorporated dance & Qi Gong with pilates & yoga. She has great body awareness & knows what stretches, poses, moves feel great in what order to keep you inspired to keep opening up your body. I always feel energized more when I'm done with her videos.

They cute YOUR left & Right. Teigh & Gillian alone on simple stage w/their positive, upbeat personalities & seem to get along great. The stage is simple & the music is Middle Eastern w/a great deep beat to keep you grounded & calm unlike Kenny G type music.
The Goddess Booty went by very fast, it felt like I was only exercising for 8 min, but it is 22 min. There is no menu. They start with a yoga mudra & breathing real quick, then kundalini yoga seated torso circles & & torso back/forth with breath. Then quick to side laying & leg lifts & circles & frog (leg/hip lifts when laying on stomach) on each side with child's pose 2 second rests in between. Then on knees & forearms is more leg lifts & rest with calf to chest stretch or modified version. Next callanetics /bar method / lotte berk method seated knee lifts (more challenging then those), knee to chest stretch & knee to each side back/forth for hip circulation. Next is more challenging version of callanetics standing tiny squats, hip tucks & standing leg lifts with more balance challenge. Next is yoga chair pose, seated spinal twist, threading the needle for hip stretch & ends with a visualization & mudra for abundance in life.

Goddess Yoga Core
Starts with kundalini yoga with arms behind head torso twists w/breath for 3 min, alternating between rolling like a ball & boat pose, lying down single leg lifts & then the straight leg to side w/o letting it go to the ground for strengthening spinal twist & both legs, lying holding straight legs at 45 angle, on elbow side plank, on elbow plank, on stomach pilates swimming, locust, plank w/leg lift & knee to nose w/breath of fire, bow pose, full side plank, full camel, fun torso rolling stretch, downward facing dog, standing fwd bend, diaphragmatic breathing (slight squat & full exhales & holding to massage organs, slight squat cat/cow stretch, standing full side bends, full squat balance w/good qi gong energy cultivation hands & ends w/mudra.

I felt very energized & positive after doing this & it made me want to exercise even more! Their positive words were helpful to make me want to do this again & again. I was able to even do my best camel with the best ease because of Teigh's words to ""visualize a string coming up from your heart to the moon, oppositional energy, enjoy the space you are creating...""
I've only tried their Latin/Easy workouts & didn't like the dance portion as much & thought the toning workout was too easy. I think as well because there were other students who were not as in good strength or not as in a positive mood or aware of their bodies who probably hoping the workout would end immediately got to me. Gillian & Teigh alone like this I LOVE.",1184803200,,3146,4.525483304042179
2680829,5,B000JYXX7E,"It's not the first product of this kind purchased by me,but because I have some others at home,I've decided to enlarge my personal library. And I'm very glad with the results. The workout is purely complete,you don't need anything else for seeing real results. Keep doing it and you'll get better. The touch of yoga is the cream on top and this makes it mor.e special. Buy it and you'll see the magic in it.",1184803200,,407,4.44
2680830,2,B000JYXX7E,"When the DVD finally arrived at the workout it was a good one.  I would have kept this workout if it had more workout and less ""motivational"" mumbo jumbo.  Now it is in the charity bin!",1184544000,,185,4.111111111111111
2680831,4,B000JYXX7E,"I really like the workout.  The two women in the DVD have a really good workout and explain everything very well, and I feel the results as I'm working out with this DVD.  The personalities of the two women just seem a little strange, but it's not really fair to judge people in a workout video.  Besides the personalities, I love the DVD and the workout!  It was well worth the money!!!",1181433600,,387,4.333333333333333
2680832,5,B000JYXX7E,"I do tradional Hatha and Kundalini Yoga and this was really nice for a change. It wasn't boring at all and the exercises really do work! If you think that this workout is too easy, then you really aren't doing it properly. For a longer set I recommend doing both DVD's. Well worth the money. I love this workout for when I don't feel like spending over an hour doing tradional Yoga and want results.",1178496000,,399,4.333333333333333

8153645,5,B000JYXX7E,"Yes they're goofy, cheesy, and over the top. But I love em - they are positive and inspirational and they motivate me to try my best.

My cats seem to find it entertaining.....and I'm not getting chubbier",1410825600,,353,4.205882352941177

8153648,3,B000JYXX7E,"I own 97% of all the Yoga Booty Ballet DVDs out  there.  This one is not my favorite. Then again it is not my least favorite either. Then again I don't have one... Anyway, what exactly is a goddess ab? If I knew I would be better at judging my abs accordingly. Maybe these two firecrackers seen on the cover (Gilligan and Tiara I think are their names), know the answer. I keep writing to them but they never communicate back (at least not with words or letters). I recently made friends with someone who grew up on the islands. Maybe they'll know. Until then this video is ok I guess.",1353283200,,585,4.261261261261262
8153649,5,B000JYXX7E,Great workout DVD.  I have purchased many of the Yoga Booty Ballet DVD's but I had outgrown them.  I bought the Master Series hoping for a more advanced Yoga workout.  This DVD did not disappoint.  There is a Goddess Booty portion that lasts 25 minutes and the Core portion lasts for 30 minutes. It is perfect  for getting my workout in before I leave for the job in the mornings. I definitely recommend this DVD.,1351468800,,413,4.453333333333333
