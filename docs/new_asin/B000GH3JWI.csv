2611355,5,B000GH3JWI,"I watched this film a couple of months ago and it is still on my mind. It was riveting, I didn't want it to end.
So many issues were touched upon. It is a must for all who care about rescue regardless of what country we live in. My heart goes out to the people interviewed. The trauma of their experiences will stay with them for the rest of their lives.",1230508800,3,354,4.0
2611356,5,B000GH3JWI,"An incredibly concise overview of what went on in New Orleans during the animal rescue post Hurricane Katrina and Rita. The documentary manages to not pass judgment and doesn't exclusively point fingers, yet there is still an undercurrent of truth to the stories. The bare bones of the story of the dedicated volunteers are there, but the movie is a long way from being the specific story. Be warned though you will shed tears, if you do not  you need to reexamine your humanity. My dog and I watched this film together - he was worriedly jumping up and straining his whole body to find out which serious atrocity was being committed and I must admit I bawled on quite a few occasions even though I have seen most of the footage and pictures before. The special features are always worth taking a look at - they are supplementary to the main story and are additional scenes of the rescues that took place by the Winn Dixie Rescue Group.",1217116800,3,936,4.538461538461538
2611357,4,B000GH3JWI,"I remember seeing a small film crew wandering through our animal rescue site in New Orleans and wondering, without ever stopping work, if I'd ever see the result. Now I have. I am impressed. The filmmakers clearly had a pro-animal agenda, something I can get behind, but they still presented a balanced look at rescue efforts. While it was cool to see people I'd met on the screen, I appreciated even more the first-person style of following several rescuers in action, as well as the view from other rescue centers. While following rescuers, the film acknowledges the dissension between rescue philosophies without judgment or unnecessary focus.
This film does not shy away from showing the worst results of the disaster, including the aftermath of dog shooting by NO law enforcement officers, and it is this that makes the film's agenda evident. Some images are perhaps dwelled on longer than necessary, and yet they are part of the truth. Above all, the film was true to its tagline. It shows as much of the truth as it can in this time. And if every element and every rescue group is not depicted, the filmmakers have shown enough to give the watcher the essence of the experience. A short epilogue ties up the story with statistics and where-they-were-afterward info. Nice job, Shidog Films. And thanks.",1189900800,,1308,4.869955156950673
2611358,4,B000GH3JWI,"Overall, this video gives the viewer a good idea of what it was like to have been involved in the greatest animal rescue mission in American history.  You can feel the fatigue, frustration, sadness, and even happiness of the rescuers.  These people are real heroes, leaving their jobs and families to do the dirty work that few people wanted to do or even cared about.  My only complaint is that the video seemed to focus more on dog rescue.  There is some token cat footage, but for the most part, this video is about dog rescue.",1171670400,10,530,4.489583333333333
2611359,5,B000GH3JWI,"I got a real view of what it was like to be at the eye of the aftermath of the storm.  This movie made me think about the animals that were left behind.

I watched the movie with my husband and in-laws while on vacation.  We all enjoyed it.  We talked about it for 2 days.  Very informative.  Great narration.  Interesting images.  Makes me want to adopt a dog!!!!",1152489600,11,364,4.173913043478261

8132142,5,B000GH3JWI,"I watched this video years ago, and I cannot remember where I bought it from.  This was a powerful documentary.  Have your Kleenex ready!  I wish all of us had the guts to do what those vigilante animal rescuers did.  When the big animal charities were setting up rescue sites and organizing who does what, the clock was ticking and animals were dying.  Things were not happening fast enough.  The handful of animal lovers who found each other at the gates of the flood and a crucial decision point -- hurry and wait, or hurry and save -- made the right decision.  I am proud of each and everyone of them! Especially the ""dog whisperer"" whose fear was set aside to rescue even the most frightened and viscous dogs still tied up in flooded backyards starving and afraid of help.  His dog skills were magic.  And when they painted ""You should be shot"" on someone's front door, I nearly stood up and clapped.  Watch this film, share it with others.  And to all the animals that lost their lives in that horrible storm because you were left behind, animals everywhere now have new laws to protect them from being left behind like you were.",1503792000,,1135,4.514705882352941

8132144,5,B000GH3JWI,I HIGHLY recommend this DVD! If you love anything dealing with Animal Rescues than this one is worth getting! It's nice to know there are compassionate people out there that truly care about the welfare of all animals!,1411948800,,218,4.7631578947368425

8132146,5,B000GH3JWI,I wanted this video as I rescued in the 9th and other areas along with a group featured in this video. It was really well done and showed the effects on the rescuers as well as the animals. Heartbreaking.,1367107200,,204,4.256410256410256
8132147,5,B000GH3JWI,"I thought this would be too sad to watch.  It was quite sad, but also quite inspirational on how people can be and what they went through to rescue these animals.",1306108800,,162,4.225806451612903
8132148,1,B000GH3JWI,"Let me first point out that I am what one would call a radical leftist.  And I do believe in animal rights... up to a point.  But since I frequent a lot of anarcho-leftist literature and correspond with many others who share that persuasion, I am very familiar with how the extreme, heavy-handed though well intentioned ""animal rights activist"" allows him/herself to descend into misanthropy.

People come first.  I'm sorry, but as a humanist and an idealist I see no point in adopting the mantra quipped often by many amongst the entire animal rights community: that the suffering of animals should be more disturbing than the suffering of people.

Contrary to what is said in the review above mine this is a pervasive attitude amongst this branch of activism.  It is casually discussed in the documentary when the ""acitivists"" can be heard literally saying that dead human beings don't bother them.  Instead it is a dead cat that ""haunts their dreams"" and motivates them to sacrifice all on behalf of the rescue effort.  Although a bit more extreme than most, these people are not a whole new breed of animal activist, they share an ideological foundation which I think is dangerous and nihilistic as well as a blow to sensible animal rights activism.

People need to remember that true humanitarians, root word being human, were busy during the post Katrina period trying to save actual people, retrieve and process the dead, and reunite human beings with each other.  I don't think that these rescuers of human beings are pretty much absent in the documentary because of artistic license and an attempt to focus on the subject matter.  I think these ""animal rights"" weasels probably had to avoid running into actual rescuers who had been finding dead bodies, breaking horrible news to the bereaved,and generally witnessing the complete assault on humanity.  I know if I were on a rescue crew during that time I would probably assault one of these jerks simply on the premise that ALL resources and efforts should be geared towards dealing with the human loss before shifting to pets.

Again, nobody likes to see animals suffer, and it was unfortunate what happened in New Orleans.  Dog fighting is abhorrent, and the pigs who wear blue in New Orleans show a shocking disregard for animal life.

But we need to remember that no matter how much we love our pets we are supposed to love our fellow man more by biological decree, and don't give me the sanctimonious hit list of attrocities that a misanthrope always runs to when they want to elevate animals to a level that is unhealthy.

I will say that the new protocol devised by FEMA after the fact, which the documentary mentions in the end, is an acceptable way to perform pet rescues after a disaster.  But it doesn't apply to Katrina, when the agency was a running joke whose malfeasance became the centerpiece of the tragedy. Since you are already in the aftermath of failed policies the purpose should immediately be a collective, unified, somewhat ""partisan"" effort to save and help other people.  To in any way justify otherwise in the chaos of such horrors is simply irresponsible.",1302739200,,3144,4.833955223880597
8132149,5,B000GH3JWI,"As a former SPCA Inspector and a current Disaster Management Consultant, this was a mind numbing show.

Today, there are some officials who believe that shooting pets is the solution - this documentary clearly disproves this option and the solution is a multi agency response enabled through pre-event planning.

Although many hearts where in the right place, this doco proves the point that ""do gooders"" can do more harm than good - not only in their response, but to themselves. Untrained responders need to be effectively managed and the contrast between the professionalism of existing and credible organisations like the SPCA and HSUS in comparison to spontangeous organisations certainly proves this point.

The causal factors such as FEMA policy on animal management are not thoroughly examined, but that is not the focus of the doco - its about the rescue and the realities of such operations.

But as Leslie Irvine (Filling the Ark) points out, despite the passage of the PETS Act by Senate - Pets are actually the less vulnerable of the animal community, and what is not well publicised is the millions of intensively farmed animals that died during Katrina, many left in factory cages with no means to escape or fend for themselves.

Whether you are an animal emergency manager, animal lover or animal activist - this is a fascinating and sobering documentary.

8132150,1,B000GH3JWI,"This film makes all animal activists look bad, and the animal-hating population can easily use this against us.

It was very noble of the people in this film to go to New Orleans with the intention of saving pets. But when they broke into house after house, even when they couldn't hear or see any evidence an animal was in there, that was illegal and pointless. In one scene, one of the HSUS volunteers is shown taking Mardi Gras beads from one residence. She tells the cameraman not to include that into the film, and says she wants to ""spread joy"" with them. The blatant theft/looting of the items was not very joyful for whoever owned them. The 'Winn-Dixie' group also was shown looting a grocery store- not of food or other essential items, but bottles of wine and liquors. Another way to make everyone look bad.

The worst parts were where the rescuers repeatedly badmouthed the pets' owners. Strings of insults about them being cruel and deserving jail were peppered throughout the film. I was not there, but from what I have read/heard, the residents were forcibly evacuated and expected to be able to return in a few days. No one expected it to be over a month. Told by soldiers with machine guns that you cannot take your animals, most people understandably complied, and did what they could to leave supplies for their dogs and cats. I doubt any of them expected the water to get so deep that it would drown a chained dog.  Nor did they expect to be forcibly detained against their wills in the superdome while their pets starved. But that is what happened, and the makers of this film do not mention at all how the government at all levels contributed to this horror. Somehow, the pet owners became the scapegoats instead,and the rescuers spraypainted insulting graffiti on several houses to this effect.

Meanwhile, they spent enormous effort saving vicious fighting dogs, while seemingly letting most cats run off. How well the film may have been made is not relevant; the content of the film is. I hope few see this, as it makes all of us animal welfare advocates look bad in many ways.",1251244800,2,2101,4.639784946236559
