2594451,5,B000FZEU24,"The Paradise Virus is not an action movie.
This is a drama which relies exclusively on the acting abilities of the cast.
Ralph Moeller (Conan the Series) shows that he can do more than fighting scenes. He shows true passion for his religous beliefs which is why his performance is the best of all the actors in this movie. The lead actor, Lorenzo Lamas, has a surprisingly good screen presence.

I rate this a five star movie",1223942400,,425,4.51948051948052
2594452,5,B000FZEU24,"I knew nothing about this film when I bought it but I am a fan of Lorenzo Lamas so I took a chance.
 Here is a film that does not include any martial arts, but simply shows Lorenzo playing the charactor of a man who is trying to save his daughter from a deadly virus.
 I comepletely enjoyed the film and the role that Lorenzo played. I hope to see him do more films like this one.",1193616000,2,380,3.9220779220779223

8127946,3,B000FZEU24,"Not the best virus outbreak movie I have seen.
But for a low budget one it's okay, did not age well with time but if you like
pandemic movies this is one to add to your collection.
I agree it could of been better with a bigger budget they slacked off with the ending in
my opinion.",1411084800,,281,3.9473684210526314
8127947,1,B000FZEU24,Lorenzo Lamas has starred in some of the finest crappy movies around. This is not one of them. Barely-veiled new-age spiritualist schlock that numbs the mind and deadens the soul. I may be a lesser man for actually sitting through this.,1398556800,,236,4.780487804878049

Poor acting and budget killed this.

If you are a Lorenzo fan..it's worth it to watch it.",1258502400,2,218,3.9318181818181817
