8291535,5,B001D2651C,"It's a good end to a good series. The final episode is a parody of Cinderella missed with elements of Snow White. I too wish the final episode was done like the rest of the series, but it was funny. This DVD also includes a music video from the series.",1247529600,,252,4.06

 During the fight Mizuho takes a hit that leads to Takako discovering his secret. She does not tell anyone else and he becomes more populer with the girls of the school. He tells Takako he will resign and leave school after the dance. Well Mizuho leave school or will Takako come to the dance and convice him to stay? What does Mariya say to Takako to get her to go tot he dance?

 I enjoyed the end of the story and I do wish there was alittle more. The last episode has everyone in the tiny forms when they get silly I am sorry I do not remeber what it is called. It is funny but I am not a fan of that style kindy wish they did it like the rest of the series.",1227744000,,1889,3.9920424403183024
