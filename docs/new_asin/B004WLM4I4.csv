8502792,4,B004WLM4I4,"No DVD is perfect, and this is no exception.  Still, this one will keep your attention, especially if you are looking for quality color footage of N&W's last years in WVA and Ohio. The photographer seems to have shot 16mm, and had a tripod or a steady hand.  Many advantageous angles such as shooting on the sunny side, on mostly nice days, and standing on the inside of curves, as well as framing shots with signals, effective panning including some pacing shots, are all in evidence here.  The profusion of 1950s automobiles along roadsides and on paralleling highways are an added bonus in many shots.
The great majority, in fact, almost all, of the film shown is from WVA, especially Iaeger, Elkhorn Mountain, Powhaton, and Williamson to name a few of his ""favorite haunts"".  There is less than two minutes of footage in the Blue Ridge area, only 35 seconds at Bluefield, and nothing east of Blue Ridge.  The narration is raspy and uninspired, even halting at times, and the occasional music soundtrack is an elevator music disco version of some early-70s Diana Ross hit, hardly appropriate for grungy railroad action in West Virginia coal country.  The sound is dubbed from O. Winston Link's recordings, and is timed out pretty well, although they use Link's famous high-pitched echoing whistle at least one time too many.
Still, don't let any of these minor nitpicks discourage you from acquiring this DVD.  Barring future time travel, it's the nearest we'll ever get to a time now long gone, when articulated behemoths roamed the Virginias in search of coal from the bowels of the earth.",1371945600,2,1594,4.8597785977859775
