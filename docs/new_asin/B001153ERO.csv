8240638,4,B001153ERO,"The Lone Wolf (a.k.a. Vuk samotnjak) is a 1972 Yugoslavian film which was dubbed for English audiences and shown on the CBS Children's Film Festival in 1973. This dubbed version is what was later released in the US by Children's Treasures.

The film follows a young boy named Ranko as he befriends a roaming German military dog. The German Shepherd, whom Ranko calls Hund because of the ID on his tag, befriends the boy, but has a price on his head since the townspeople think he's killing sheep. Ranko is desperate to prove what a gentle soul Hund has, but finds himself up against his father, grandmother, and his whole town, to try and save his friend from their rifles and pitchforks.

It's a rare treasure to find an older foreign kids film like this, even if only on VHS. Hopefully those Children's Film Festival movies will one day find their way back onto shelves in some DVD sets.
