I thought the actress who played the evil mother was so good that I just hated her. The casting was brilliant as each actress/actor was perfect for their role. I started off not liking Lee Seung Ki but by half way through, he won me over.  This drama has a darker storyline but I rate it as good as my all time favorite ""You're Beautiful"" because of the characters in the drama. I'm glad the ending was happy for everyone. The English translation is excellent.",1306886400,,625,4.333333333333333
4902668,5,B005XB7E2S,Very good plot and outstanding performance of all the actors and actresses in this TV drama series!  I liked very much the development of Hwan and Eun Sung's hate-love relationship.,1300147200,,181,5.033333333333333
4902669,5,B005XB7E2S,"Brilliant Legacy one of the best korean dramas.  Lee Seung Gi acting performance is brilliant and Han Hyo Joo beautiful as usual, Bae Soo Bin handsome as ever, this truly is a touching story, full of twists and turns.  ""A Must See"" for every Korean Drama Addict. This box set is too expensive and have subtitles typos, so its better to find it in other websites.  I got a different version than this one (US YES Version) and it is exactly the same for less.",1283904000,5,457,4.352941176470588
4902670,5,B005XB7E2S,"Very nice movie, hope it will happen to me.  The seller knows business very well.  The item was delivered quickly and in good condition.  Hope to make business again with this seller.",1280016000,,183,4.65625
4902671,5,B005XB7E2S,"I bought this drama without any previous knowledge of what it was about. I have to admit that the nice cover art and catchy title combined with YAentertainmen's track record did it for me. All twenty-eight episodes of this series are well paced and thought out. The story is, albeit predictable to a fault, enjoyable and each episode ends in a rather nice cliffhanger. There is always something interesting to look forward to throughout the series, meaning that it does not get annoyingly repetitive. The antagonists are scheming and conniving, but you can still find personality traits and emotions which lead to you empathize with them at times. The main characters are good hearted, but not naive. Once the protagonist, Eug-Seung, realizes her family betrayed her, she does not believe them again and analyzes their behavior (step mom and sister) and the implications it has had in what happened to her. I don't want to give it away,  but this actress sure knows how to cry a good tear.
The packaging is O.K., there is nothing amazing about it. It is just an artbox with three individual DVD cases inside. The last case contains two smiley face pins (the ones used by the employees at Jinsung). The only tiny problem I noticed with the subtitles was somewhere in DVD case #2 where some words were switched, as in ""he is the in room."" Other than that, nothing else worth mentioning.
I have to say that the price here in Amazon is a bit steep. I would either wait for it to be on sale or shop around (there are other places where you can save money). Other than that, I'm sure you'll enjoy this series",1272240000,14,1602,4.621052631578947
8488482,5,B005XB7E2S,Oh my gosh! This is my all time favorite drama! I love the story and the actress. I've learned a lot from this drama.,1397865600,,117,3.9166666666666665
8488483,5,B005XB7E2S,His drama rates right up there with producer Yoon Suk-Ho's four seasonal drama series. Need lot's of Kleenex  for this drama. I can see why Han Hyo Joo and Moon Chae Won were voted top awards for series. Well worth the money if you like this kind of korean drama.,1395532800,,263,4.26
8488484,5,B005XB7E2S,Really enjoyed this Korean movie.  The story-line is well plotted and the acting is very good.  I highly recommend it.,1366329600,,118,4.85
8488485,5,B005XB7E2S,I did enjoy this but it got a little intense in a few spots. Definitely a soap opera but you want the guy to grow up so badly. You are rooting for him to wake up. He is worth rescuing. We all liked this a lot.,1353888000,,209,3.5652173913043477
8488486,5,B005XB7E2S,"All my favorite K-Dramas have strong core values and this one is compassion. A young lady, although abandoned by her step-mother, takes in an old woman off the street who is hurt and has temporary memory loss. Turns out that the old woman is rich and the head of a prosperous company, and after regaining her memory, puts the girl to the test by doing irrational and annoying things. After obtaining a promise that she will not be abandoned, the old woman decides to return the favor and takes the girl home, threatening to make the girl her heir in place of the irresponsible, spoiled family. The threat has a redemptive, if hilarious, effect on the family, as the grandma puts them all to work in her company.",1345334400,2,711,4.5625
8488487,1,B005XB7E2S,I love K Drama but this is like MELODRAMA overkill!  The one character I absolutely loved gets a cold shoulder...what's up with that????  Overall it is just too much drama.  I mean the main actress cries for 90% of the show.  It was also too long to keep my interest.  I actually was so bored I fast forwarded lots of the show.  I would not recommend it unless you like DRAMA and I mean DRAMA!!,1339113600,4,394,4.1866666666666665
8488488,5,B005XB7E2S,"I got addict to the drama and finally addict to the actress. The first half part of the story are very great, the late half are a little bit of not as great as the first half, but the  late half have several best scenes. The ending is great!",1329955200,2,241,3.9183673469387754
8488489,5,B005XB7E2S,"Wonderful drama about family, friendship and love.  Superb performances by HHJ and LSG.  This DVD box set is of high quality.  Special features brought lots of behind the scenes insight.",1328832000,,186,5.133333333333334
8488490,5,B005XB7E2S,"A girl is ditched by her stepmother but befriends a rich old woman and subsequently moves in with the family, which consists of two spoiled grandchildren and their high maintenance mother.  The old woman (who owns a prosperous beef soup restaurant chain) then decides to give her inheritance to the new girl, which creates consternation within the family as well as the company.  By the end of episode 5 all of the main characters are set up in very compelling ways and the conflicts are based off of manipulation, misinformation and ignorance, so the viewer is glued to the screen to see if (and when) each of the characters discover the little truths that have been hidden away from them.  The protagonist's stepmother is a backstabbing, manipulative wench who could very well be the most despicable character in the history of K-dramas (the viewer's blood is guaranteed to boil furiously!).  False accusations and rumors are piled onto the lead protagonist in huge quantities, but her perseverance builds character and makes her very likable.  Hyo-joo Han turns in a great performance that demands a wide range of emotion.  On the negative side, there are contrivances and coincidences that do get annoying at times, but the dramatic elements are so emotionally affecting that this K-drama series (28 episodes, 60 minutes each) cannot be denied its rightful place as one of the best ever.",1327449600,,1391,5.0
8488491,5,B005XB7E2S,"Excellent Buy!  Amazing Characters, especially the Evil Step Mother.  Kind of like a riches to rags/snow white storyline, but with a few twists here and there.  Two main characters were outstanding. Love/Hate relationship which pulled through in the end.  Highly recommend!",1307923200,,273,5.585365853658536
