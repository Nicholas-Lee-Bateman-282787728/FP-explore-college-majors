889812,5,6304457316,STAGECOACH IS CONSIDERED THE MOVIE THAT GAVE JOHN WAYNE INTERNATIONAL EXPOSURE. THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE CHARACTERS CREATES A TENSE THRILLING ACCOUNT OF A GROUP OF VERY DIFFERENT PEOPLE WHO ARE FORCED TO SHARE A  DANGEROUS JOURNEY. THIS MOVE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.,916704000,,267,5.512195121951219

890046,4,6304457316,"I'm not quite sure how I feel. I'm thinking this was a 4 1/2 star movie. I always like Claire Trevor - she seems so earnest in every role she's in - regardless of type. John Wayne was John Wayne. Although I felt the characters were not fully developed, overall, the film was good at displaying the attitudes that prevailed among people of various social strata. And, for all the people who like to complain about racism in movies made over 70 years ago - don't watch them! I have mostly AA ancestry and I don't go to pieces every time I see a mammy portrayal - for goodness sake it was how people were viewed during THOSE times.",1518307200,,628,4.285714285714286

890208,3,6304457316,"I guess by 1939 standards, this was a very good movie.  But watching arrows thunk into the stagecoach from incorrect angles, someone in the stage take an arrow to the chest on an impossible shot, Indians being shot off their horses in pairs, etc., etc., well it just became laughable. Also, they're in a fast moving stagecoach on bumpy ground and the interior shots show the passengers sitting rather nicely, no rattling or jolting around.  Very odd.  And the movie could have used a few more jolts of excitement throughout.  I see a lot of people really like this movie.  I think it was just okay.  Nothing here really knocked my socks off.",1508716800,,641,4.628318584070796

A diverse group of passengers set out on the road through hell.  The way is dusty, treacherous, and fraught with incivility.  Run out of town by the Law and Order League, prostitute Dallas (Claire Trevor) is given a hard time by all and sundry.  Also run out of town is Doc Boone (Thomas Mitchell), a drunk.  A banker/crook (Berton Churchill), a whiskey salesman (Donald Meek), a gambler (John Carradine), a snooty pregnant woman (Louise Platt), and a late passenger (John Wayne as the Ringo Kid) round out those who ride inside.  Topside is the incomparable Andy Devine as the stage driver and Marshal Wilcox (George Bancroft) as the guard.  With the military only escorting them just so far, the rest of the ride is bumpy in more ways than one.  This movie doesnt skimp on character development or action/suspense.

890973,5,6304457316,"I am writing this Review after watching this classic Western on Video released by Warner Brothers in 1967. As far as I know it is a complete reissue of the original B & W movie released in1939 which won 2 Academy Awards,and lasts the same time of 97 minutes. I also can't say if other versions such as DVD or BlueRay are different in quality or otherwise.
As I watched the Video,I was quite impressed with the quality and the fact that it had been released in 1939,that's now 76 years ago. Who would have believed that in future years,that one would buy copies of these movies and be able to watch them at will in one's own home.
I was also highly impressed with the fantastic scenery shots that had to be done in B & W as color was only in the future at that time. I must admit though,that the sound left much to be desired,particularly when compared to what was to come in later years. However,I still found watching this version to be very enjoyable ,and I really felt like I was experiencing what viewing the movie would have been like in 1939The storyline and the acting is superb,especially considering when it was made. It is no surprise it won 2 Acadwmy Awards and set a whole new standard ,thus becoming a classic.
 Although John Wayne had made many movies B movies though he had not risen to the mega star that he would become in future years. .",1446768000,,1355,4.355731225296442

This is 5 years after ""The Big Trail"" (filmed in 1929 & released in 1930), John Wayne's first big-screen debut as a Western star (with the under-rated brilliance of director Raoul Walsh.)

-----------------

Certain bromides are repeated often regarding classic Hollywood movies.

""Citizen Kane (1941) is the best picture ever.

""Singin' In The Rain"" (1952) is the best musical ever.

And........

""Stagecoach"" (1939) is the best western ever!

So the universal wisdom and gospel of the movie buffs goes.

The fact is that ""Stagecoach"" (1939) deserves its long enjoyed reputation as a classic.

The actors are all wonderful.

The script is wonderful.

The direction is wonderful.

And, for me best of all, the camera work and presentation of Monument Valley, Arizona (owned entirely by the Navajo American Indian Nation, along with the all land along the eastern Arizona/ New Mexico border, including the Painted Desert!) is a thrill and one of the best black and white travelogues every made in the movies.

Monument Valley, Arizona (located on the far Northeastern corner of the state) is breathtaking, and ""Stagecoach"" (1939) director John Ford shows us why.

Monument Valley never changes. Same wonderful place 30 years after ""Stagecoach"" (1939) was made, presented in 1969 in the ""Easy Rider"" (1969) movie starring Peter Fonda.

Another good (color!) depiction of Monument Valley, AZ is presented in ""Easy Rider"" (1969) shown as Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper motor cycle though it...incredible color sunsets in that movie are wonderful.

But the best ""Monument Valley"" movie of all is ""Stagecoach"" (1939), which has long been an old friend at my house, screened and re-screened faithfully at least once yearly every year, always reliable, aways welcome, always edifying.

Hooray for ""Stagecoach"" (1939).

Make friends with this movie. You won't be sorry!

891515,5,6304457316,"Stagecoach was John Ford's epic 1939 film that rescued John Wayne from ten years of B-movie apprenticeship, and introduced American audiences to the beauties of Monument Valley as a dramatic backdrop for western movies. It is the story of nine people on a stagecoach journey from Tonto, Arizona to Lordsburg, New Mexico: the driver and shotgun (Andy Devine and George Bancroft), the lady of easy virtue and the drunken doctor who have been forced out of town (Claire Trevor and Thomas Mitchell), the whiskey salesman (Donald Meek), the pregnant wife of a U.S. Cavalry officer (Louise Platt), the Southern gentleman gambler (John Carradine), and the embezzling banker (Berton Churchill). To these is added a revenge-minded Ringo Kid (John Wayne) whom they pick up on the trail. With these nine threads John Ford weaves a tapestry of action, adventure, despair and redemption, all played out against the stark beauty of the American Southwest.

Orson Welles considered Stagecoach to be such a directorial tour de force that he reportedly screened it 39 times during the making of his first film, Citizen Kane, as an example to himself and his crew of how a film should be constructed. This Criterion edition contains the usual generous helping of extras that make the viewing more enjoyable, and the craftsmanship of John Ford more evident, pointing out his tricks of composition, lighting, the interplay of contrasting characters, and his use of the landscape setting. One extra is a 34-page booklet that includes the complete Collier's Magazine short story Stage to Lordsburg, by popular western writer Ernest Haycox, which was the basis for the film. A bonus on the disc is a 54-minute John Ford silent film from 1917, ""Bucking Broadway"", starring Harry Carey, the last of nine films Ford directed in his first year as a director at the age of 23. Other extras include a lengthy BBC interview with Ford at his home in 1968, when the director was in his mid-seventies; Ford home videos narrated by his grandson Dan Ford; an interview with director Peter Bogdanovich; an item about Monument Valley and trading post operator Harry Goulding, who brought the valley to Ford's attention; a radio play of Stagecoach from 1948; and a trailer.

Of special note, and nicely covered in one of the extras on the disc, is Yakima Canutt, the stunt coordinator for the film, who was also the stuntman in the same year for the blockbuster Gone with the Wind. Canutt is the ""Indian"" who leaps from his horse onto the lead pair of coach horses in an attempt to bring the stagecoach to a stop, only to be shot by the Ringo Kid and dragged beneath the team. Then Ringo has to do the famous leap from the coach to the wheel horses, to the middle pair, and finally to the lead pair in order to recover the lines dropped by the wounded driver. This too was Canutt, and not Wayne, so the stuntman was both Indian attacker and cowboy rescuer in the same scene.

Thomas Mitchell was a busy actor in 1939, appearing in three out of the four top films in that greatest of Hollywood years. An Oscar winner for his drunken Doc Boone in Stagecoach, he also appeared as Scarlett O'Hara's father Gerald in Gone with the Wind, and as a reporter in Frank Capra's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Who knows, maybe he was even a Munchkin in The Wizard of Oz.

A technical note about subtitles on Criterion's Stagecoach: the film has meticulously complete subtitles, but you might never realize that, because they are neither mentioned in nor accessible from the disc menu. To find the subtitles you must hit the ""subtitles"" button on your player's remote, or lacking that, the ""display"" button, which brings up a player menu which includes subtitles. Both the ""subtitles"" and ""display"" button access methods can be used only after the main feature has been started. Update: I did a quick survey of a few of my many Criterion movies. Virtually every movie, whether on DVD or Blu-ray, has subtitles. The only exception was English language silent films, which have the original intertitles. Foreign language silent movies, by contrast, have English subtitles which run automatically under the foreign language intertitles. Foreign language sound films indicate on the case and in the disc menu that English (and sometime other languages) subtitles are available, and they can be accessed from the disc menu. So far as I have surveyed my collection, the Criterion English-language sound films all have subtitles, but this fact is unmentioned on the case or on the disc menu.",1412294400,5,4532,4.881818181818182

I don't know exactly when the term ""ensemble cast"" was coined, but it could've been invented for this film; by anyone's standards, the list of players reads like an all-star cast, and each actor seems to have been born for his or her role:  an incredibly young John Wayne as the Ringo Kid, Claire Trevor as the beautiful and vulnerable ""soiled dove"" Dallas, Thomas Mitchell as the drunken Doc Boone, Andy Devine as the stagecoach driver, John Carradine as the gentlemanly Southern gambler, the aptly named Donald Meek as the whiskey drummer Peacock. . .  The list goes on, all of them perfectly cast.  (I'll refer you to IMDB for the complete listing.)  Each of these characters harbors a humanizing flaw, which through the course of events in the film he/she is able to overcome in the moment of crisis -- whether it's Doc Boone's sobering up to deliver Mrs. Mallory's baby or Dallas's helping with the delivery and caring for the newborn, despite repeated rebuffs by the aristocratic Mallory.  Even the timid Peacock, wounded by an Apache arrow, displays courage under fire, not to mention infinite compassion and wisdom from his experience as a family man.

But of course the headline stars of the film are John Wayne and Claire Trevor.  Wayne portrays the Ringo Kid without bluster or bravado:  it's a well-modulated performance -- the depiction of a young man falsely imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit and out to remedy that injustice with calm determination.  He treats the beautiful ""fallen-woman"" Dallas with courtesy and consideration that most of the other passengers deny her and ultimately saves her from further ill-fame as a prostitute.  (I won't argue the political correctness of whether or not she needs ""saving"":  I'm referring to the context of the movie, not commenting on the appropriateness of prostitution as a career choice.)  Of course, in the action scenes, Ringo is ever-ready with his proto-Rifleman Winchester, whether it's to fight off an attack by Apaches (again, I won't argue the political incorrectness of the portrayal of Native Americans) or to face his ultimate showdown with the evil Plummer brothers.  Finally, ""Stagecoach"" has a satisfying resolution ""as only celluloid can deliver,"" as Ringo and Dallas ride off together to his ranch, leaving their respective pasts behind.

In sum, ""Stagecoach"" is a classic Western with a perfectly chosen cast.  It is a genuine screen treasure and a perfect example of James Goldman's tribute to this great American genre:  ""There are no masses in Dodge City, only individuals whose will to good or evil brings them to the ends they deserve.""

891733,5,6304457316,"This movie made in 1939 is apparently the one that made John Wayne a star.  It is probably his best western and also one of the best westerns ever made.  It was directed by the famous John Ford.  I never paid much attention to his movies but now can see why he is acclaimed.

It seems that most of the outdoor shots were filmed in Monument Valley in southern Utah just across the border from Arizona.  This gives the film a genuine look.  Most of the close-up shots must have been filmed in Hollywood.

The basic plot is a stagecoach ride through arid Arizona from safe outpost to outpost.  The stagecoach is full of various characters, somewhat reminiscent of the Canterbury Tales.  The main danger is an attack by Apache Indians led by the famous chief Geronimo.

Ironically Wayne is initially an outlaw travelling with the group but eventually shows everybody that he is his usual man of fairness and integrity.  Some of the recognizable actors who later appeared in countless movies are Thomas Mitchell (the alcoholic doctor), Andy Devine (the stagecoach driver and perennial comic), and Donald Meek (the whisky salesman) who co-incidentally always played himself as a meek character.

Eventually an Apache attack develops and looks clichd because we have seen such an attack so many times.  However this film was probably one of the first, if not the first, to develop this portrayal and the copies have made it a clich.  The ending has a final encounter reminiscent of High Noon which shows that the latter copied it from the former.

The main difference between this film and today's politics is that then the Apaches were the bad guys and the white settlers were the good guys.  Nowadays of course it is mandatory to portray any Indians as the good guys and any white settlers as the bad guys.

It is the seminal John Ford Western; the first one he made in the sound era, the first with Wayne and the first in Monument Valley...he would team up w/Wayne and revisit the Valley many times after this. It is not Wayne's first A-list Western as some believe; he starred in the Raoul Walsh-directed ""The Big Trail"" in 1930; but it was a huge box-office flop; and Wayne was mostly relegated to ""Poverty Row"", B-list Westerns until his breakout role in this film. While Wayne turns in a fine performance as the Ringo Kid - not one of his best, but very good - he is not the only reason for watching this fine film. His co-star, Claire Trevor, was a much bigger name than Wayne at the time and was given lead billing...she plays Dallas, the quintessential saloon gal w/the heart of gold. The ubiquitous Thomas Mitchell (he was in four other major films in 1939, including ""GWTW"", ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" and ""Mr Smith Goes to Washington"") won a much deserved Oscar for his role as the iconic drunken town doc who always sobers up when he's needed. Andy Devine, who along with Gabby Hays and Walter Brennan, defined the Western sidekick role, plays the stage driver, Buck. John Carradine, in his best Simon Legree attire, actually plays a good guy...the post-Civil War southern gentleman who turns to gambling to make a living, but is still a gentleman at heart. And look for Donald Meek, who's name defines his character...and most of the characters he played. Combine those and other fine actors w/John ford and mix in a runaway stagecoach scene, an Apache attack led by Geronimo, the US Cavalry to the rescue, a suspenseful gunfight, and the hero riding off with his lady and you've got great cinema...one of the top ten Westerns of all time!",1393632000,5,1839,4.609756097560975

 Stagecoach (1939) I have long heard about how great this film was so I finally purchased it and watched it. Starting out, I was startled at how stupid, meaningless and moronic it was. It was like watching a depression era Cartoon. Presented are a bunch of idiotic, tiresome, ""civilized"" people chatting about nothing in particular. Once they get on the Stagecoach it's no better, their self-righteous attitude, which comes across in the director's and script writers' intents, are much to stomach. You have a prejudiced, aristocratic dandy (John Carradine), a dumb as nails loner (John Wayne), a gullible, understanding prostitute, a vile corrupt banker, a smug small-minded ""preacher"", an inane drunk doctor, an annoying sanctimonious ""lady"" (who is pregnant) and a few other dimwits, all riding on the Stagecoach, ever fearful of the ""evil Indian"" attack. They talk about the most frivolous rubbish ever imagined. All of the characters are entirely irksome. Scenes proceed from A to B without any story, good dialogue or interest.

The Apache are played by Navajo Indians (or a Mexican woman in ranch scene) in close ups and by blatant white stunt men in the horse shots. Of course, as expected, since this is filmed by a virulent, white bigoted Director, financed by a greedy studio and written by calloused short-sighted, studio stable script writers, it is no surprise that the Apache are played off as a hostile threat to the grand white civilized lifestyle (if you have a brain, you will observe that the 'grand white civilized lifestyle' is nothing but a bunch of loathing drunks who shoot each other). You will notice that the Apache are so inept that they can't even stop a Stagecoach, and are shot by the rabble riding in said Stagecoach, who never run out of bullets and put down about 55 of the attacking Apache in one of the most shallow, impalpable scenes ever imagined. If you are wondering how the Apache stopped Stagecoaches, all they had to do was shoot one horse. The Apache, by that time, having been reduced to being a poor starving band of corralled slaves, imprisoned, murdered by the US government and it's hostile citizens, were fighting for survival at that point. Instead, they are called ""savages"" and made to resemble sub-human scum. Having lived with the Apache myself, I realize that they have a rich culture, are deeply spiritual and had a love for their land.

If you can get past all the inept portrayals and ostensible characters, which if you are intelligent, is impossible to forgive, then at least you can enjoy a narrative but Stagecoach lacks that as well. John Ford doesn't even give us a palpable story. All that is left is cheap 1930's gimmicky cutouts, as John Wayne instantly falls in love with ostracized prostitute, kills all bad guys, then everything is fine.

After Stagecoach (1939) was over I was left questioning all the misleading ""great"" reviews. I burned my copy as it has no value whatsoever, not even as average entertainment.

891811,4,6304457316,"A couple of reviewers nail it: in many ways, this movie stretches credulity to a ridiculous level.  The most obvious bit that doesn't make sense is the epic Indian chase. The pursuers simply would have shot the lead horses on the coach's team quite early on.

My mind immediately leaps to the imaginary scene thereafter:  Screaming horses flail as Buck (the driver) and Ringo go flying and the stage overturns.  Indians dismount to speedily dispatch and scalp the two, as the door of the stage opens and other male passengers are shot or feathered as they emerge.  Indians cluster around the door.  Close up of Dallas and Lucy (and baby) screaming, trapped inside.  Cut to long shot as Ford ""averts his eyes"" (and ours) on a fate ""worse than death"" and...THE END.

However, the movie is so skillfully made that most of us are swept up in the action and never consider the obvious. I always thought the arrival of the troopers as the real climax of the movie. Of course, it isn't. Other scenes in town are necessary to ""resolve"" other plot elements.  But, in dramatic terms, NOTHING that happens later--can compare in visual or dramatic terms.

Were the many plot elements and characters presented in 1939 that are now regarded as clichs regarded as such at the time?

891814,5,6304457316,"Being a classic, there isn't much that I can add to other people's review about this movie, except that I enjoyed it. It is my favorite John Wayne movie next to Rio Bravo and The Man Who Shot Libert Valance. Stagecoach has a group of major players who share a stagecoach that must cross Monument Valley on their way to an unruly town called Longbourn while apaches led by Geronimo are on the loose. A whore and a drunken doctor who are thrown out of town, a young respectable lady who's married to a soldier, a whiskey drummer (salesman), a gentleman who offers protection to the young lady, a banker (who ironically steals money from the bank he works for), a fugitive who seeks vengeance for his brother's death, a sheriff who wants to keep him in prison for his own safety, and the stagecoach driver are the major players here. As they move toward Longbourn, the audience learns of their differences, their weaknesses, their social prejudice, and their fears. Some actors, like the driver, the doctor, and the drummer, offer comic moments; while the others act out their personal dramas and prejudice. Being a John Ford film, it doesn't hold to today's politically correct standards. The apaches only get a small piece of the action almost at the end of the movie. They aren't real characters, but a plot device that serves as a unifying thread to the movie. Smoke signals and a burned down ferry station serve as a signpost of the apaches' ominous presence in the film which helps unify all the characters (except the banker) in the common goal of surviving the west. Although not politically correct for using Apaches as mere plot device, it never gets to the level of being offensive. On the  contrary, the film succeeds in its purpose: it delivers fun, including the dread encounter with the apaches. It is a great film and a great western.",1389312000,3,1847,4.683076923076923

892006,5,6304457316,"STAGECOACH, A Powerful Story of 9 Strange People (yea, thats the subtitle) : I like that everyone in this movie has a public image and a private reality. I don't read the film as a allegory for the taming of the west or anything like that. Rather I read it as a comment on social roles in a changing (and often divided) America. At the outset of the film both doc and Dallas are chased out of town by a bunch of bible bangers (The Law and Order League) and they are joined on the coach by the liquor producer Peacock, the aesthete gambler Hatfield and his pregnant (upper crust) mistress (who pretends to be in love with a cavalryman). And completing this wild bunch is the banker Gatewood (who is embezzling loot from his own bank). The working class dudes sit outside and drive the coach and protect it from villains like Ringo, who of course is not a villain. In the city those with polished images have the upper hand but out in the natural elements everyones true identities emerge. So, yea, this is a cast of wild west archetypes, but the story could be set in any time period and in any location and remain unchanged b/c the Indians play no real part in this film (they could just as well be an avalanche or a monsoon or the Depression or WWII).  We identify the banker as an ass who hides behind a public image right away and we idenitfy the Ringo kid as the guy whose real talents only emerge when things get real. So its an impossible story not to love. I even like Wayne here b/c hes not really all that macho, he's still young and sensitive and one of the first things he says is that they call him Ringo but that his real name is Henry. Thats my favorite part of the film. Hes completely embarrassed of his outlaw image and disassociates himself from it---for him public image is meaningless. Thats why hes so drawn to Dallas--she too has been unfairly branded. Thats what the film is really about-- examining the unreliability of social labels/idenitities (and by extension the unreliability of a society that rewards the wrong people). And of course this expose of social realities creates a desire for a higher form of justice (that only art can satisfy).

892083,5,6304457316,"As the rights pass from distributor to distributor, there have been quite a few issues of the 1939 Stagecoach, from Universal's barebone's UK PAL issue to Warner's NTSC single-disc edition that included trailers for various John Ford films to their more ambitious two-disc edition with a Scott Eyman audio commentary which also included the documentary American Masters - John Ford/John Wayne: The Filmmaker and the Legend, featurette Stagecoach - A Story of Redemption and a vintage radio adaptation. It doesn't help that Amazon have lumped the reviews for all the different editions together, but thus far the best to go far is Criterion's excellent two disc NTSC set (though bear in mind the Bluray edition is Region A locked).

Even in 1939 there wasn't anything strikingly original about Stagecoach, but that doesn't stop it being a terrific little picture even if, stylistically, it's a very schizophrenic one. Much of the film, particularly the interior scenes, is very much a 1930s picture, yet once they reach the ferry and the big battle with the Apache kicks in it suddenly becomes a strikingly modern one with far more imaginative and dynamic camerawork than you usually find in Ford's films, making it no surprise that this was the film Greg Toland used to teach Orson Welles about filmmaking, only for the style to suddenly revert almost to the 1920s once it reaches its destination, Lordsburg. Indeed, the scenes with Luke Plummer have a look and feel that could almost have come straight out of a silent western, albeit a moodily photographed one (throughout the picture Bert Glennon's photography opts for darker, deeper blacks than was the norm for the genre) - although Ford ultimately decides to play the dialogue-free scene almost by sound alone. You don't even get to see the final gunfight, Ford cutting away as soon as it begins, preferring tension over action. Yet somehow the grab bag of styles melds surprisingly well and the film is still remarkably entertaining and holds up much better 70 years on than its forgotten remakes.

The surprisingly rough looking title sequence, complete with tramline scratching, doesn't bode well for Criterion's much-vaunted improved transfer, but once the film gets started the quality improves massively: it's probably fair to say this is the very best it's ever looked on the small screen, and possibly the best it's looked since it came out. Also included among the copious extras on Criterion's two-disc set (including 72 minutes of unedited footage of a typically difficult Ford interview with Philip Jenkinson) is the restored silent John Ford comedy Bucking Broadway, starring its producer Harry Carey Jr. as a cowhand who follows his fianc (Molly Malone) to New York when she runs out on him and her Mark Twain lookalike father with a city slicker played by Vester Pegg, the ugliest of the Plummer boys in Stagecoach (the one who couldn't even hit a cat at four paces). Since neither of her beaus is exactly an oil painting, unless it's one of Dorian Grey, she's obviously not got particularly high standards, but the same could be said of whoever decided to back this story. A tiresome affair even at 54 minutes that veers more to maudlin sentimentality over comedy - neither of the two would-be comic setpieces work and there are few attempts to mine the situation for comedy elsewhere - it's probably fair to say that this wasn't funny in 1917 and it certainly isn't funny today. There are a couple of interesting visuals, but it's a long, hard slog.",1374796800,5,3523,4.969491525423729

What I like so much, is that the scenes exhibit greater reality of what the old west was, and how men and women lived, dressed, and why they were that way. Those who ""went west"" were often adventurous, running away, or looking for a better life with the freedom to start all over. Of course there also were many who had a strong hunch that they would make money out west. The characters in Stagecoach seemed believable and of course my favorites are the Duke and Claire Trevor, but all the actors brought it together. But the music!!! I so miss the beauty and life in the music used in these wonderful old westerns. It painted a canvas of what the west looked like, from dusty, dirty, dry to beautiful in that special way that defines the desert and hills of that part of America. The story itself is describing humans with their strengths, weaknesses, moral character and faith, and does it without the nonsense that is in too many films today.

892183,5,6304457316,"After 10 hungry years of ""B"" movies and film serials, John Wayne got his first starring role in a big film.  Under the, sometimes berating tutelage of famed director John Ford, Wayne was brilliant as Ringo Kid who was a recent escapee from prison.  The trumped up charges had something to do with his involvement with the Plummer brothers who had killed Ringo's brother.

Ringo hooks up with a stagecoach headed to Lordsburg, New Mexico from Tonto, Arizona.  This is Indian country, so there is great danger, especially after the U. S. Calvary will only go with them so far.  The passenger list is an interesting one.  Dallas (excellent Claire Trevor) and Doc Boone (Oscar winning Thomas Mitchell) are being run out of town for being a woman of ill repute and the town drunk, respectively.  John Carradine plays Hatfield, a gambler and escort for Lucy Mallory (Louise Platt), a pregnant woman on her way to meet her husband, an Army officer.  Berton Churchill plays Gatewood, a blowhard banker seen earlier cleaning out a bank safe.  Peacock (Donald Meek) is a liquor salesman who quickly becomes best friends with Doc.  Curley (George Bancroft) is the ""captain"" of the stage and also happens to be a U. S. Marshal, who then has double duty to get Ringo back to the calaboose.  Andy Divine was recruited to be the stage driver Buck.  As explained in one of the bonus documentaries, Divine was not only an excellent character actor but one of the few who could drive a 6-team stagecoach.

Cultural commentary and tolerance is the true theme of this brilliantly played out western.  Most consider this the first ""mature"" western and I have to agree.  Many of the themes are seen in modern films.  I've watched many of those old ""B"" movies with Wayne, Roy Rogers, Gene Autry and others in recent years.  They all have the same plot and other than having some great horsemanship, they are all terrible.  Ford was very innovative with this film, shot in gorgeous Monument Valley; he even breaks the rule for shooting a scene involving the stage being chased by Indians from both sides.  The camera angle suggests the stage is going one direction then the other.  Wayne's performance is excellent.  Ford focuses the camera on close-ups in many scenes.  Wayne has little dialog but a lot of screen time.  Much of his acting is reactionary.  ""Stagecoach"" set a high bar for those who followed and remains one of my favorite films.

I should also add that this non-Criterion 2-disc DVD includes a commentary by Scott Eyman, a John Ford biographer and two excellent documentaries:  ""John Ford/John Wayne: The Filmmaker and The Legend"" and ""Stagecoach: A Story of Redemption.""  There is also an audio only radio version with Claire Trevor and Randolph Scott.",1373068800,,2747,4.814102564102564

892277,4,6304457316,"""Stagecoach"" is a B&W Western from 1939. I'm a big Western fan but I didn't view this classic until last night (although, of course, I've seen clips here and there over the years). When it comes to really old movies like this I generally dislike the music and the B&W photography, so the story and characters really have to work in order for me to enjoy the picture. Not to worry here as within 20-25 minutes I found myself involved in the story.

THE PLOT: A number of characters travel on a stagecoach through an area where Geronimo and his clan are on the warpath. The people include a somewhat goofy driver and his shotgun, a marshal; inside are an outcast prostitute, an escaped prisoner named the Ringo Kid (John Wayne), a pregnant woman traveling to meet up with her husband, a suave Southern gambler who knew the lady's father during the Civil War, an alcoholic doctor, a crooked banker and a meek whiskey salesman.

The first 2/3 of the film is mostly character development as the group travels on the stagecoach and spends the night here and there. The last third involves an action-packed Indian attack and the Ringo Kid settling scores. The attack is quite thrilling and there are a couple of outstanding stunts.

Films like this are like going back in time to the period in which it was made. Although times have changed dramatically there's not a lot of difference in some ways. People are people whatever the time period and certain behaviors or lifestyles will never be respected by society at large no matter how ""progressive"" we become, like being a prostitute or drunkard. It's just the moral facts of life.

The film works because it establishes the characters well and effectively builds suspense concerning the Natives. The outcasts all prove their worth one way or another because they all want redemption or to make things right. The doctor may be a drunk but no one else on the stage can do what he can; the saloon girl is repeatedly overlooked or disrespected until the Ringo Kid stands up for her honor, an outlaw, no less. The marshal must perform his duty, but how do you take an ""outlaw"" in when you've been through a life or death situation together and he was instrumental in their survival?

Something else occurred to me while watching. People often think that the ""antihero"" originated in the mid-to-late 60s with the Spaghetti Western and the like, but we see the whole ""good badman"" concept here way back in 1939. Or consider Brando's character in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-Eyed-Jacks-Slim-Case/dp/B0007WPJBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One-Eyed Jacks [Slim Case</a>]"" from 1961. In other words, the antihero was nothing new in the late 60s.

It's also great seeing John Wayne back when he was lean and mean, or pretty kind actually.

The film runs 96 minutes and was shot in California, Colorado, Arizona and Monument Valley, Utah.

FINAL SAY: Step back in time and enjoy a truly classic Western.

If I were to rate the blu-ray on picture quality alone, it would be more like a 1.5 or 2...  I would not recommend the purchase of this Blu-Ray version until the film is fully restored.  I am astounded that it has not already been restored.  The transfer is poor at best. There are far too many streaks and spots in just about every scene for my liking.

I've seen quite a few BRD's dropping down to the $5.00 to $10 range.  I have also been noticing that the transfers of these lower priced BRD's are very often the same as DVD quality.

892394,4,6304457316,"Stagecoach is not only a quality film, but an influential one. It set the standard for the modern Western, outside of B film level entertainment (both in its literacy and daring- the stunts of Canutt, during the Apache attack, are justly famed), and it made a star out of John Wayne, right from his dramatic entrance into the film (replete with out of focus zoom and twirling rifle). But it also is a great example of a film that, on the surface, seems to be all clich and melodrama, but via Dudley Nichols' and Ben Hecht's non-wasteful screenplay (adapted from Ernest Haycox's short story The Stage To Lordsburg which had roots in Guy de Maupassant's short story Boule De Suif), and acting, rises well above such. It resists clich by subverting it with the performances and writing. There's not even a mediocre performance in the film (look at how often details of plot are conveyed via the eyes of characters). I know of no film where the eyes of its actors convey so much, so many times, and so consistently. Even John Wayne comes across as sympathetic, gentlemanly, and lovable, and most of his `acting' comes in reaction shots where he is silent or says little. One need only look at many other films from the 1930s to see how different Wayne's acting style was from the remnants of the overly theatrical acting styles of the silent film era actors that were still around. Claire Trevor is adorable as her non-trite version of the hooker with a heart of gold, and Thomas Mitchell won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar, as the Doctor, and deserved it. His progression from drunk to indignant righteousness in the face of Luke Plummer's gunbarrel, is truly a pleasure to watch, and a clinic in acting subtlety and bravado in tandem. The other Oscar the film won was for musical scoring, for Richard Hageman, W. Franke Harling, John Leipold, and Leo Shuken, yet, the score is really unmemorable, and the worst scene in the film (one of only a few points which keep the film as a near-great, not great film) is a scene where the Apache wife of a local Mexican sings. It simply is out of place in the film. The cinematography, by Bert Glennon, is quite good, especially in the Apache chase sequence that alternates between live locations shooting, and rear screen projections, and in numerous compositions in Monument Valley.

  As mentioned, watching Stagecoach, then comparing it to later films in Ford's canon, is sort of depressing, because it makes one wonder how much of this film's success was just happenstance, since, such a literate and well acted film never again made its way to the screen under the John Ford name. Nonetheless, watching this film was a pleasure, both in and of itself, and in how it is that rare work of art that forcefully demonstrates to me that even I can succumb to the rigors of habit, in expecting too little from a certain work of art merely because most works of art, in any genre, or from any artist, so often conform to one's worst expectations. Thus chastened, I implore anyone else with that or a similar bias to toss it aside, for a while, and allow its destruction under Stagecoach's ever turning wheels. What's left won't be worth much, if at all, but often it's the loss of something that is the best part of the thing. I think Doc and Curly would agree.",1340236800,,3298,4.634188034188035
892395,4,6304457316,"Stagecoach is a must-see, must-love movie.  When released it redefined what the western could be, and helped launch the careers of John Wayne and Ford into the stars.  This is a five-star movie that deals with complex issues of human relations, social problems, and so on.

On the other hand, I've docked a star for the technical quality of the film.  Lines, scratches, artifacts, and other visual problems are not just present, but persistant throughout the film.  Very little of the movie has the pristine, perfect look I had hoped for when purchasing this bluray.  There is even at times some sound issues, including speaker hiss.

To be fair, some of these problems -perhaps most -are unavoidable.  I see criterion's claim that this is the best possible picture and sound.  I have enough criterion films to trust this claim.

I'm writing for those who already have one of the Warner Bros editions and are wondering if you should upgrade to this one.  IMO, unless you're an absolute fanatic about the movie and want to explore the plentiful special features, I say no.  Why?  Because it simply doesn't look as good as you'd expect from a remastered Blu-ray edition.  Criterion tells us this transfer is the best they could do with the elements available, and there's no reason to doubt this.  It's just that these elements aren't great.  The film is full of scratches, dirt and a ton of cinch marks at the beginning and end of reels, and there wasn't enough money to spend for the labor and computer time that fixing these aberrations would require.  In many shots, the focus is soft.  So although the Blu-ray looks better than the standard editions, it doesn't look THAT much better.  The best of the remastered Blu-ray classics have set the bar pretty high for what I expect when I purchase them (such as Treasure of the Sierra Madre and The Adventures of Robin Hood), and this one isn't close.  If you're on the fence, rent it before you buy it.  I'm sorry I didn't.  If you do buy it, lower your expectations and you'll certainly enjoy it more than I did.",1334534400,20,1348,4.497942386831276

Directed by John Ford

Director John Ford combined action, drama, humor, and well-drawn characters in the story of a stagecoach set to leave Tonto, New Mexico for a distant settlement in Lordsburg, with a diverse group of passengers on board. Dallas is a woman with a scandalous past who has been driven out of town by the high-minded ladies of the community. Lucy Mallory (Louise Platt) is the wife of a cavalry officer stationed in Lordsburg, and she's determined to be with him. Hatfield (John Carradine) is a smooth-talking cardsharp who claims to be along to ""protect"" Lucy, although he seems to have romantic intentions. Dr. Boone (Thomas Mitchell) is a self-styled philosopher, a drunkard, and a physician who's been stripped of his license. Mr. Peacock (Donald Meek) is a slightly nervous whiskey salesman. Gatewood (Berton Churchill) is a crooked banker who needs to get out of town. Buck (Andy Devine) is the hayseed stage driver, and Sheriff Curley Wilcox (George Bancroft) is along to offer protection and keep an eye peeled for the Ringo Kid (John Wayne), a well-known outlaw who has just broken out of jail. While Wilcox does find Ringo, a principled man who gives himself up without a fight, the real danger lies farther down the trail, where a band of Apaches, led by Geronimo, could attack at any time.

Stagecoach offers plenty of cowboys, Indians, shootouts, and chases, aided by Yakima Canutt's remarkable stunt work and Bert Glennon's majestic photography of Ford's beloved Monument Valley. It also offers a strong screenplay by Dudley Nichols with plenty of room for the cast to show its stuff. John Wayne's performance made him a star after years as a B-Western leading man, and Thomas Mitchell won an Oscar for what could have been just another comic relief role. Thousands of films have followed Stagecoach's path, but none have ever improved on its formula.

Although there were Westerns before it, Stagecoach quickly became a template for all movie Westerns to shoot for.

Oscar Winner for Best Supporting Actor (Thomas Mitchell) & Best Music Scoring.

Oscar Nominations for Best Picture, Best Director (John Ford), Best Cinematography (Black & White), Art Direction & Editing

John Wayne: The Duke - one of the most recognizable people on the planet - a true mega-star in film

* Special footnote: -- John Ford's first sound Western, and his first in that genre in 13 years. Westerns had fallen out favor with the coming of sound, as it was tricky to record on location.  This was the first of many films that John Ford filmed in Monument Valley, Arizona. Others were: My Darling Clementine, Fort Apache, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, Wagon Master, Rio Grande, The Searchers, Sergeant Rutledge and his last western, Cheyenne Autumn.

** Asked why, in the climactic chase scene, the Indians didn't simply shoot the horses to stop the stagecoach, director John Ford replied, ""Because that would have been the end of the movie.""

892461,5,6304457316,"Jean-Luc Godard, later a famous metteur en scne himself, in his early days as a film critic said that to make a movie, you (only) needed a girl and a gun. John Ford (1894-1973), maker of about 140 films over fifty years, a giant and a legend, most of them Westerns, would have added a horse, perhaps a stagecoach, to that definition. He would never leave out the female, one of whom in this world of rough and rowdy men, would invariably serve as a pivot of sanity. Well, welcome to Stagecoach, as fresh as on the first day, with action that beats today's luna park rollercoasters. John Wayne, a good kid, temporary turned bad, but turning good again, proves an invaluable shoot in the Apache attack. The film has all classic Ford characteristics: location shooting, with long shots against the horizon, and little talk beyond the necessary minimum to get the action understood, and, of course, its share of romance. Will easily keep his five stars.",1317859200,2,949,4.688622754491018

892464,3,6304457316,"I'm glad that I checked the Criterion issue of Stagecoach out of the library rather than buying it. While the transfer is marginally better than the Warners' issue and the extras on the second disk are worthwhile (especially the piece on Yakima Canutt), other things are quite disappointing. Jim Kitses' commentary is arrogant and tedious; he misses Ford's clear (and well documented) intention to have the Ringo Kid/John Wayne as the centering point of the ensemble cast. Scott Eyman's commentary on the Warners' issue is more interesting, more accessible to nonspecialists, and easier to listen to; it also reflects his expertise as the author of Print the Legend: The Life and Times of John Ford (2001). In addition, Criterion provides only a single subtitle track (English) while Warners' offers English, French, Spanish, and close captioning. Finally the Criterion booklet is problematic in many ways. The typefaces for cast/ credits/ headings are difficult to read. Some pages are almost impossible to read because the contrast between the type and the color of the page is insufficient (light yellow type on a dark yellow page is only one example of poor design choice); the disk menus suffer from the same readability flaws for any but young, sharp eyes. It is nice to have Ernest Haycox's original short story in the booklet, but as this is easily available online, it is not of significant benefit. Finally, the essay by David Cairns in the Criterion booklet is well worth missing. His descriptions of the actors are unprofessional (a description of Thomas Mitchell as having the ""body of a giant baby, face of a sodden chimp, yet oddly noble of aspect"" is appalling). And, more research into the background of Stagecoach would be valuable (for example, he claims the scene where Hatfield primes to shoot Lucy so she doesn't fall into the hands of the Apache comes from Birth of a Nation (1915), when it is far more likely to have come from the Thomas Ince/Francis Ford The Invaders (1912) and/or DWGriffith's Battle of Elderbush Gulch (1913)). All in all, this Criterion issue is quite disappointing. I regularly buy upgraded DVDs when they become available in order to have the best material available for the film classes that I teach--and I was particularly looking forward to the Criterion's Stagecoach, a film which I consider to be one of the best westerns ever filmed. Sadly though this is one DVD that I won't be buying.",1315785600,11,2439,4.965770171149145

892466,5,6304457316,"This film was made in 1939 which seems like a million years ago. Directed by John Ford and starring John Wayne, it is a piece of movie history, winning two Oscars and epitomizing what has come to be remembered as an iconic western.  I loved stepping back in time to a bygone era and watching the high adventure of several people thrown together on a stagecoach and fighting Indian attacks as well as their own personal problems.

Yes, there are stereotypes in this film but don't' forget the year it was produced, before the term ""Native Americans"" was even considered and where women were either ""good"" wives and mothers or ""bad loose women"".  Other stereotypes include an  alcoholic doctor and a former confederate gentleman. John Wayne's role is that of a young man who made a few mistakes in life but who is redeeming himself by honoring women and by shooting bad guys.  But, most of all, this is a fine story that moved fast, kept my eyes glued to the screen and made me smile.

The film was produced in black and white which added an authenticity that transported me into a time and place in history when special effects were primitive and ""political correctness"" wasn't invented yet.  This was just a good story, well told.",1313020800,5,1230,4.640552995391705

892468,4,6304457316,"I think I should preface this by saying that I am not a big John Wayne fan nor am I a fan of the Western; they are just two facets of the cinematic world I've never truly embraced.  Yes, I have like both of them on certain occasions, but they are not regular parts of my cinematic diet and I don't feel any craving for them.  To be honest, the only reason I watched this film was because I adore everything Oscar and felt the need to see it at least once.

I kind of really liked this film.

`Stagecoach' is much more intimate than I expected (being considered a Western epic of sorts) and I appreciated that close-knit nature.  It is littered with apparent flaws that I couldn't help but note (the scripting is rather predictable and certain characters are generic and clich&eacute;d) but the overall flow of the film was nicely orchestrated thanks to some slick direction from John Ford, and the famed chase scene with the Apache's is vigorously exciting and wholly entertaining.

The film centers around a group of very different individuals aboard a stagecoach embarking across Indian territory for various reasons.  There is a drunken doctor, a prostitute, a pregnant woman, a criminal, his escort and a few others.  The film kind of lives and dies within the ensemble, some reaching heights of excellence (Thomas Mitchell is the rightful standout, as his Oscar win would attest to) and some failing to ignite (Donald Meek was, well...Donald Meek).  The scripting leaves some to be desired, for it doesn't do a whole lot for some of the characters development (and that ending was rather preposterous) but it does manage to find some slivers of gold in the rough, especially with regards to the female characters, their social status and eventual acceptance of one another, and Louise Platt gives an honest and transcendent performance as the upper-crust so-to-speak; Lucy Mallory.

Is anyone else completely annoyed by Andy Devine's voice?

In the end I really enjoyed `Stagecoach'.  It is a thrilling and engaging Western that chips away at its characters rather well.  It has its faults, but it masks them well with surefire excitement and intrigue.  Heck, even John Wayne turned in a fault-free performance!",1302566400,2,2216,4.85904255319149
892469,5,6304457316,"This movie was made in the 30's and it features the standard stereotypes at first. However the characters do spring to life and even change in this movie. This movie made john ford's career and for good reason. The blu ray is expensive. However critireon spent money to remove dirt and lines and still the print often has defects.  I must say however that critireon doesn't do a good job to price a newer movie at such a price because unlike this one they did no restoration work. But still this is the best I have seen this movie and I even wish that they'd even restored it fully so there was no lines even if they had to use computers to do it.
Still I am glad to add this classic to my collection and one must remember that this movie is of it's time the 30's and not today. And western movies had been in a tight format for 30 years at the time. todays westerns are more realistic but that is besides the point because this is still a fine and classic movie in which the confines of the stagecoach make for strange bedfellows and good drama with the native americans providing the antagonists here. It could be aliens though and still be a great story! And lest we forget , the real west was filled with raids by native americans and settlers killing off native americans as well. It was not a time of understanding often ,unlike today where we can see it from a distance. This is worth owning and it is as good as it's going to be. It's in it's native aspect and black and white. People shot in color alot then sadly so it's what you get. there's no excuse these days for black and white but then it was a different story and non black and white fans should still enjoy the movies story.",1301702400,3,1693,4.241486068111455

892522,5,6304457316,"I own this videotape of STAGECOACH. It was dubbed from an unrestored film that's in fairly good condition.

STAGECOACH was John Wayne's 80th movie. In retrospect, the previous 79, mostly 'B' grade programmers, give no indication of this journeyman actor's box office potential. It took John Ford to recognize Wayne's natural talent and charisma and capture them on-screen. His faith in Duke was rewarded, and the masterpiece they and a sterling cast created elevated the western from Saturday matinee fare to an art form revered around the world.

It's a complete work, a brilliant amalgam of action, romance, comedy and melodrama, with Duke spot-on perfect as the Ringo Kid. The story is simultaneously confined to a small coach or a cramped way station and as wide as the magnficence of Arizona's Monument Valley.

Simple, broad strokes, perfectly placed, achieving something very deep and subtle.  It's easy to see how this film influenced Orson Welles, I believe he watched it thirty times or so during the making of Citizen Kane (though a lot of that time was spent in discussion while the movie was playing).  Ford is one of the few directors who can actually make me sit through a western, a genre I otherwise don't care for.

Moral ambiguity abounds as a cast of disparate characters are put together in claustrophobic environments and forced to deal with each other in the ultimate road trip movie (still used today:  Rain Man, Little Miss Sunshine).  Orson Welles watched Stagecoach over 40 times while filming Citizen Kane and incorporated scenes with ceilings (a practice rarely used).  Akira Kurosawa was inspired so much by this movie he went on to make The Seven Samarai.  Stop and think about this for a minute, Stagecoach was responsible for two of the greatest movies ever made!!

Be prepared when you first put it on -- the opening is surprisingly scratchy.  Apparently the restoration team removed any nicks and blemishes that they could without leaving evidence of their work.  Other imperfections were left in place -- and there are plenty of them.

However, things improve quickly.  While there ARE heavily scratched sections at points throughout the film -- apparently around the reel changes -- most of the movie has only light scratching, with certain scenes (especially towards the end) looking nearly pristine.

Over-all, the sharpness, contrast and detail is impressive.  It varies quite a bit from scene to scene, but certain shots have that ""almost 3d"" feel that hi-def is famous for.  Close-ups are often beautiful with every bead of sweat and stray hair visible.  And even in the weakest sections detail is noticeably improved over the DVD.

As the liner notes explain, the original negative is long gone and the print was assembled from the best sources.  While this can't compare to the restorations on Casablanca and The Third Man, it's a solid upgrade and well worth the purchase.

Oh -- it's a great movie too!  ;)",1276905600,10,1241,4.990243902439024

For a while I wondered if this edition of Stagecoach had indeed been restored.  The opening monoaural sound track suffered greatly, as it warbled its way alongside the black & white picture.  Maybe not as out of place as I had thought.  Yes, there is a plethora of supplementary material as well as a surprisingly large book that accompanies the package, but what should come first would be the quality of the film, which itself speaks volumes about motion-picture making in the early days of talking pictures.",1276732800,7,796,4.8088235294117645
892580,5,6304457316,"I will not go through much of the story as that is why you are buying the movie. Alternatively, of course, like me you just want to see what they did with the movie and the Criterion extras.  Just having a newfangled 46"" TV helps in its self.

Looks like several passengers are going to Lordsburg for their own various reasons. Like an Agatha Christie movie, we are introduced to the major players in the story.  On the way, we get to know the passengers a little better. In this version, Ringo Kid (John Wayne) is picked up on the way instead of being intruded with the original passengers. John Wayne actually inters with what is now his signature close-up. An Apache uprising threatens the stagecoach. Yet there is a lot more to the film after this Arrowing incident.

Be sure to go through the DVD extras including the voice over commentary. Recorded exclusively for the Criterion collection in 2009, the commentary features film historian and Western scholar Jim Kites (Horizons West). He is a little wordy in his commentary but he does pick up the high points. Moreover, sometimes you need somebody to tell you when your shoe was untied I used to get him to tell me what I was looking at and missing. Even after this commentary, you need to watch the supplement named ""Dreaming of Jeanie"".

On a different note, I saw Monument Valley on a vacation. Therefore, I can tell that they keep driving back and forth in a small aria on their imaginary trip to Lordsburg.

I am and new fan of Ernest Haycox and read some of his books. However, I missed ""Stage to Lordsburg"". It is now on my list to read.

Is it an iconic film, the film that raised the western from its B movie, Saturday afternoon kiddie matinee status to something more adult and more respected? I don't know. I'm not a critic. I'm a movie lover.

It is what one of my daughters calls ""a grey movie"" (she insists they are not truly black and white) and many people, especially younger ones, don't like that. It wasn't made in widescreen, and those square movies look odd on today's widescreen TVs, but The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind, two other great movies made in 1939, weren't made in widescreen either, and both have survived as iconic movies.

It was possible to make 70mm films in 1939 (The Big Trail was filmed with an even younger John Wayne in both 35mm and 70mm in 1930) but very few theaters were equipped to play them. To make money, a film has to be distributed to as wide an audience as possible, so this is a 35mm film.

This is a good, solid western with scenery that is stunning even in shades of grey. If you enjoy westerns or John Wayne, or John Ford, or any two, or all three, you should watch this movie at least once and decide for yourself if it deserves its reputation.

892632,5,6304457316,"I'm am a fan of Criterion editions, as they are the pinnacle presentations of classic films, and ""Stagecoach (The Criterion Collection)"" certainly continues the tradition, with a very fine remastered original print, two stimulating commentaries (one as an audio track during the film, the other, a separate special feature), both analyzing John Ford's approach to filmmaking, a 1917 early Ford western with Harry Carey, a 1968 Ford interview (with the director as nearly uncommunicative as ever), color home movies with commentary by Ford's grandson, Dan Ford, an appreciation by Peter Bogdanovich, tributes to Monument Valley 'discoverer' Harry Goulding and stunt man supreme Yakima Canutt, a 1949 radio production of ""Stagecoach"", introduced by Ford and starring John Wayne and Claire Trevor...all captivating, and completely wonderful...

But I wish somebody might have included a 'Making of' documentary about the creation of the film, itself! This is a film with a fascinating history, as worthy of attention as any of the special features...Ford struggled mightily to find a studio to produce the film, as the major studios didn't want to finance a low-key western, particularly as Ford refused Gary Cooper or Joel McCrea as the lead, insisting on 'B' actor John Wayne (whom he had been 'punishing' for nearly a decade for making ""The Big Trail""). The verbal abuse Wayne took from Ford during the making of the film was legendary, but the result was undeniable; Wayne was a full-fledged star the moment he appeared onscreen. There are many more stories from the cast and crew that I've heard, over the years, all of which would have made a wonderful addition!

So I praise this edition, but wish it had offered just a little bit more...",1275091200,3,1742,5.151943462897527
892633,5,6304457316,"This new Criterion edition boasts a new restored, high definition transfer of the picture of this classic John Ford Western.  The picture quality is excellent, as is the sound.

This 1939 western has twice been remade, but the original far surpasses the 1966 remake and the 1986 made for TV version.  The story is set in 1880 in the town of Tanto in Arizona where a band of strangers set on a stagecoach journey bound for Lordsburg New Mexico.  Each of these characters have different motives, issues, and reasons for leaving Tanto to go to New Mexico.  The story contains a social commentary:  there are the 'dregs' of society who show a heart of gold, there are self-righteous members of upper society who exhibit unfounded prejudice against those different than they, there are people who are willing to sacrifice in order to save others, and those who just look out for themselves.

This movie is special for the excellent ensemble performance of these actors/actresses, which bring their rich characters to life.

Claire Trevor as Dallas
John Wayne as The Ringo Kid
Andy Devine as Buck
John Carradine as Hatfield
Thomas Mitchell as Doc Boone
Louise Platt as Lucy Mallory
George Bancroft as Marshal Curly Wilcox
Donald Meek as Samuel Peacock
Berton Churchill as Henry Gatewood
Tom Tyler as Luke Plummer

The ensemble acting is unmatched.  The glances and looks from one character to another speak volumes.  The different coupling of the characters (e.g. Dallas & the Ringo Kid, Buck & Curley, Lucy Mallory and gambler Hatfield, Doc Boone and the meek Samuel Peacock, and Gatewood all by himself) helps the viewer to see the different relationships that develop between these characters in the stagecoach.

I really enjoyed Jim Kitses' (Horizon West) insightful commentary on this movie.  Kitses does a masterful job of providing the background for the making of this classic, the symbolism, themes/motifs that run throughout the story, and insights into John Ford's moviemaking of the western.  Kitses' commentary is a bit more scholarly than Scott Eyman's commentary on the Warner Bros 2 disc special edition (henceforth abbreviated as WB version).  Eyman's simpler commentary gives insights upon the actors & actresses' performance, while Kitses gives more insight into the social commentary & meaning of the movie.

I also really liked the WB documentaries:  John Ford/ John Wayne The filmmaker & the Legend,  Stagecoach: A Story of Redemption.
I wished these were included in the Criterion version.

The Criterion version has a supplemental disc which contains these features:

Bucking Broadway (1917 silent feature by John Ford)
Philip Jenkinson's 1968 video interview with Ford
New video appreciation of Stagecoach with director and Ford biographer Peter Bogdanovich
New video homage to legendary stuntman Yakima Canutt
Video essay by Tag Gallagher
Screen Director's Playhouse 1949 radio dramatization of Stagecoach
A booklet featuring an essay by critic David Cairns and Ernest Haycox's ""Stage to Lordsburg"" (the short story that inspired the film)

I agree with the other reviewers who recommend getting both this Criterion version and the WB version (if you have enough money to spend).  Overall, I'd say that I liked the special features of the WB version a little bit more.  Too bad the WB version is out of print.

However, this Criterion version boasts excellent DVD transfer, quality sound, and a new insightful commentary.  Highly recommended!",1275004800,3,3462,5.194594594594594

892636,5,6304457316,"""Stagecoach""  is one of the greatest of big-screen Westerns.  Directed by John Ford, it is the film that made John Wayne a star and associated him with the Western genre for the rest of his career.  Until ""Stagecoach,"" the Western was relegated to the B-picture format.  Ford showed that with a solid story, interesting characters, and plenty of action, a Western could hold its own as an A-list film.

The plot concerns a group of strangers riding on a stagecoach through dangerous Apache territory.  The passengers include an alcoholic doctor (Thomas Mitchell), a woman (Louise Platt) traveling to her cavalry officer husband, a mousy whiskey salesman (Donald Meek), a gambler and Southern gentleman (John Carradine), and a prostitute (Claire Trevor) driven out of town by the Law and Order League.  The Ringo Kid (John Wayne) rides shotgun.

Though Wayne and Ford were friends, Ford hadn't used Wayne in any of his 1930's pictures, telling him to wait until he was ready as an actor.  In doubt about casting the Ringo Kid, Ford showed Wayne the script and asked his opinion.  Wayne suggested Lloyd Nolan, but eventually Ford asked Wayne to star.  That presented a problem with securing financing.  Wayne had starred in only one big-budget Western, ""The Big Trail"" (1930), and that was a box office flop.  Producer Walter Wanger wanted Gary Cooper, but Ford held firm on his decision to cast Wayne.

Ford shot much of ""Stagecoach"" in Monument Valley, providing some breathtaking images of the West's natural splendor. He also staged terrific action sequences with dangerous stunts during the Indian attacks.

The Criterion Blu-ray edition contains a newly restored high-definition digital transfer; audio commentary by Western authority Jim Kitses; the 1917 John Ford-directed silent feature ""Bucking Broadway;"" a 1968 video interview with Ford; a video appreciation of ""Stagecoach"" with director and Ford biographer Peter Bogdanovich; a video homage to legendary stuntman Yakima Canutt; and a booklet featuring an essay on the film and the short story on which the movie is based, ""Stage to Lordsburg.""",1274486400,14,2105,5.204747774480712
892637,5,6304457316,"This special edition is jam-packed with goodies for fans of the film and of the western genre, starting off with an audio commentary on the first disc by film historian and western scholar Jim Kitses. He challenges the conventional view that Stagecoach lacks the depth and command of craft of John Ford's later films. Kitses does a fantastic job of explaining how Ford's camerawork and the use of invisible editing set up differences in class and established genre conventions. When not offering expert analysis, he provides biographical information on various cast members in this eloquent and informative track.

Also included on this disc is a trailer.

Disc two starts off with ""Bucking Broadway,"" a 54-minute silent film from 1917 that stars John Ford favorite Harry Carey as a cowboy whose true love is taken away by a big city type. It features many of the themes and conventions that Ford would explore again and again in later films.

There is a 1968 interview with Ford by British journalist and television presenter Philip Jenkinson. Running over an hour, the filmmaker talks about his childhood, how he got his start as a director, working with John Wayne, and, of course, Stagecoach. Ford comes across as a no-nonsense man and plain-spoken, refusing to romanticize his past despite the interviewer's best attempts.

Filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich offers his thoughts on Stagecoach and praises the strong script and solid ensemble cast. He analyzes Wayne's performance and how he reacts to the things that happen around him. Bogdanovich also offers his impressions of Ford and Wayne, having met both of them.

""Dreaming of Jeanie"" is a video essay that examines Ford's visual style in Stagecoach. It analyzes several of the film's themes through clips and illustrates how Ford used camera movement, framing and background details to show the traits of the various characters.

""John Ford Home Movies"" is an interview with the director's grandson and biographer Dan Ford. He talks about his grandfather's home movies that show the man at his most relaxed, complete with clips from the actual films. We see the likes of John Wayne and Henry Fonda lounging around with Ford on his boat.

""True West"" is an unexpected treat featuring author Buzz Bissinger talking about the 1920s trading post operator Harry Goulding and his role in telling filmmakers like Ford about Monument Valley. The land belonged to the Navajos but he staked out a claim thanks to his friendship with them. Bissinger talks about how Goulding met Ford and persuaded him to make Stagecoach in Monument Valley.

Another outstanding extra is a featurette about legendary stuntman Yakima Canutt who performed many of the amazing stunts in the film. He went on to become an important figure in the stuntman industry. Fellow industry legend Vic Armstrong offers his thoughts and impressions of the man and talks about just how groundbreaking Canutt was back in the day.

Finally, there is ""Screen Director's Playhouse,"" a radio adaptation of Stagecoach that aired on January 9, 1949 and starred John Wayne and Claire Trevor, reprising their film roles.

Essentially a road movie, this one has a group of strangers on a journey into extraordinary situations and discoveries about themselves and their prejudices, dreams and fears.  Terrific performances from Claire Trevor, John Carradine, Thomas Mitchell and of course John Wayne is the charismatic and daring outlaw Ringo Kid.  Beautifully photographed and tightly edited, this was Ford's first trip to his beloved Monument Valley location, a place to which he would return with Wayne, most notably for THE SEARCHERS.

Look for the classic shot that introduces Wayne.  Still one of the greatest movie character intros in American cinema.  Two discs with generous extras including a poetic commentary, and a terrific booklet with a fine essay and the short story that inspired the movie.

To me, the best part of these older flicks IS the costumes of the monsters, or the painstakingly time consuming stop motion effects of masters such as Ray Harryhausen.  I'll take Yog any day over Cloverfield.  I'll also take the unbelievably crafted Toho sets over the non-existent sets of today.  Just add a building or two and three miles of green/blue screen.

I have purchased EVERY movie that John was in, good, bad or worse, including the years of his 30's.  I recently obtained his first ever movie, ""The Big Trail"". WOW!  Out of my library, I have donated to our local library the movies that I watched, did not care for and would not mind if my collection was missing them.

This movie however, WILL NEVER become separated from my collection.  When I saw this one for the first time, I fell in love all over again. Clair, John, Andy and all the others were fantastic.  Every time I see John's first appearance on screen, he twirls that rifle to cock it, I fall in love all over again and again with great acting.  There are simply too many great scenes to name them all.

I will not rehash the plot, as one prior review detailed it perfectly.  I have the collectors addition of StageCoach.  I am looking forward to this particular release and will buy it when it comes out.  IF I like this one better than the one I currently have, I will donate it also to the library.  The librarian informed me that our town here in the heart of Montana if full of John Wayne fans and that since my donations of all my John Wayne dvd's, their ""check outs"" for the libraries dvd section has tripled in the first 6 months of the fiscal year.  SO, moral of the story, John Wayne still lives on in our hearts.  If I could depart here with one thought for those who like to pick apart movies, it would be this.

Movies of old are the foundations for the today movies.  I however, prefer the ""real"" movies where we had ""real"" actors.  Those who did their own stunts, where they did not have all these special effects from digital computers.  Where the actors themselves had to ACT!!  What we have today is a sham of the past.  Even my grandson of 5yrs prefers a John Wayne movie to anything of today.  The actors of yesteryear were made of ""True Grit"".  Instead of picking apart our heritage of classics with negative reviews of the shoulda coulda thoughts, lets just simply enjoy what the screen and reels have to offer us.  GREAT entertainment that all members of the family can enjoy.  WHat a legacy we have been endowed with.

Nevertheless, this is a great picture and attempts, successfully in my opinion, to demonstrate a gamut of human frailties and strengths.  The most interesting, and most complex, person, in my opinion, is played by John Carradine.  He is an ex-Confederate officer reduced to the status of a tinhorn gambler and possibly a killer.  He combines southern manners and lethality in equal degree.  He treats his female ward with great kindness and consideration while showering the other woman on the stage--a prostitute--with understated contempt.

He absolutely glories in battle against the Apache as can be seen by the slight smile on his face.  Nevertheless, when everyone on the stage has run out of ammunition and face hideous death under the scalping knives of the Apache, Carradine saves one last bullet--not for himself--but for the woman.

892720,5,6304457316,"Conventional wisdom has it that John Ford's STAGECOACH changed the landscape of the western film, bringing it a respectability and a seriousness that it largely lacked throughout the early years of the sound era - and that it made John Wayne a star. The latter is pretty obiously true; though Wayne had starred in a big-budget, ""epic"" western nine years earlier that was made by another legendary director known for his work in the genre, Raoul Walsh's 70mm widescreen THE BIG TRAIL and gotten decent reviews for his performance, that film was a large-scale flop and Wayne was reduced to b-westerns and serials for the remainder of the decade. It's rather amazing to think that this one film was to make him the biggest star in the world for the next three decades, but when you see him appear for the first time, so much larger than life, about two reels into the film, you'll get it - if you understand the mythmaking and iconography of Hollywood even slightly.

As to the first statement, it's not quite so simple. There were actually quite a few ""serious"" westerns in 1939, with two of them even in Technicolor - and one of those was also directed by John Ford (DRUMS ALONG THE MOHAWK). The other color western, JESSE JAMES, starred matinee idol Tyrone Power, big star actor Henry Fonda, and Wayne's primary competition as a western star, Randolph Scott, and it was a huge box-office hit, placing in the top 5 for the year. The black-and-white STAGECOACH, with a much less well-known cast toplined by recent Oscar nominee Claire Trevor, didn't place in the top 10. And all of these films, as well as Cecil B. DeMille's spectacle UNION PACIFIC were shot largely on location - something else that Stagecoach often gets mentioned for, as it wasn't all that common at that point, even on larger budget pictures.  We also shouldn't forget the important seriocomic DESTRY RIDES AGAIN, with stars James Stewart and Marlene Dietrich in their first of many westerns.  A great year for the genre indeed.

So if it's not as groundbreaking as it at first might appear, why then is the film so influential, and so much better-known than the other westerns of its day? I'm sure a big part of it has to do with the specific trends it started; it was the first major western shot in Monument Valley, and the vast, empty yet splendid landscapes of the deserts and canyons would soon come to exemplify ""the west"" for generations of filmgoers, and it was the first collaboration between John Ford and John Wayne, meaningless at the time of course but hugely important in retrospect. And the fact that it's neither pretentious and self-consciously ""grand"" or ""epic"", nor overburdened by comic nonsense or songs. In short, it's a serious take on a fairly simple story, extraordinarily well-told, and it caught a fire that many have tried to imitate but few have succeeded at. The perfect recipe for a classic.

And it was also a take-off on a by-then hoary genre - the all-star many character story set in one place, pioneered by GRAND HOTEL and DINNER AT EIGHT a few years earlier. Except, of course, our disparate cast of characters is here confined (mostly) to a stagecoach and a couple of rustic buildings along the trail. We've got the alcoholic doctor (Thomas Mitchell), the town harlot (star Claire Trevor), the reluctant driver (Andy Devine), the banker-turned-thief (Benton Churchill), the marshal riding shotgun (George Bancroft), the lady who turns out to be pregnant (Louise Platt), the liquor salesman (Donald Meek), the southern gentleman card-sharp (John Carradine) and finally the outlaw Ringo Kid (Wayne). It's been given as common shorthand that all of these people are running from something - that the physical journey by stage is also a journey of the spirit for all of them; though this isn't a stretch as a reading for most of the characters, I think it's an oversimplification. Certainly the marshal and the driver are just doing their jobs; the liquor salesman seems to be also, though one wonders why he's off so far from his apparently large family; and the pregnant gentlewoman is on her way to meet her husband. As for the rest - most are well aware of what they're running from, and where they might be going; in the end only Ringo and Dallas, the lady of ill repute, are on a truly uncertain road, and not until the very end do they receive any kind of real direction.

It's all stunningly photographed by Bert Glennon, who lost out to the equally great monochrome work of Gregg Toland at the 1940 Oscars. Look at the night sequences in particular, which have an early-noirish quality about them and an immense depth of field. The shots in Lordsburg at the end actually convey the sense that this is a real town with multiple streets, blocks, alleys, etc - and it looks very different from Tonto, the town from which the stage departs. This also begs mentioning the production design - art direction by Alexander Toluboff, another big part of the influence the film had. Everything is dry and dirty, hot and sun-blistered, and you can positively smell and cough on the dust in nearly every scene. This is no clean and pretty ""Hollywood"" western where the women all look perfectly primped at every moment.

The justifiably famous Indian attack on the stage still packs an excitement that all the fast edits and tens of millions of CGI budgets just can't match, largely because the characters have all become well-developed enough by this point that we actually want to see them pull through it - and the narrative hasn't given us any reason to assume they all will. Dudley Nichols' screenplay from an Ernest Haycox story certainly contributes greatly to these wonderfully drawn little portraits, but just as impressive are the actors who inhabit these archetypes and make something more of them. The whole cast here is impressive, and you'd expect nothing less of many of these pros like Mitchell and Meek. Carradine in particular is wonderful, oscillating from likable to arrogant to tender in seconds; but there really isn't a weak link anywhere. But ultimately the show belongs to John Wayne, just as capable in the tender moments with Dallas and of showing uncertainty and fear in the face of going back to jail, of what his life might end up being, as he is of being heroic in the face of danger. No black and white, simple hero here.

NOTE ON TAPE/DVD: None of the copies of this film that have been released on either VHS or DVD thus far have been particularly good, print-wise; this old WB tape has served me well and will continue to until I grab the new Criterion, which promises to be the definitive version for the forseeable future.  This copy and the official DVD from the same source is watchable enough though, so if you can get it cheap, why not?",1268611200,,6776,4.745331069609508
892721,5,6304457316,"Now don't get me wrong here. This is one of the greatest American movies and that's why it gets five stars from me. If cowboy movies have a Citizen Kane, this is it. And yet at the same time it's a deeply surversive essay on the immorality of the wide-open American frontier that systematically questions every single civilized value that you can think of. Let's not beat around the bush, okay? Basically we're looking at the love story of a jailbird and a whore, which is the exact opposite of the conventional Western. This is the DECONSTRUCTION of the Western genre, a deliberate attempt to demolish the grand narratives of Roy Rogers and Hopalong Cassidy. This is a post-modernist film that improbably emerged 50 years before post-modernisn came into fashion, very Nietzchean in its devaluation of all values.

THE OPENING: The wives of a western town are kicking out the town whore. And why not? If you were one of those wives, would you want your husbands associating with a prostitute? Recall that there was no cure for syphilis in those days. And even worse, the wives are presented as ugly and clownish. Is this really fair to them? Funny on the surface, but nasty underneath.
THE RINGO KID: Yeah, such a great entrance! But he just busted out of prison, and he's not even old enough to vote. Okay, he has this big windy story about how he was unfairly locked up, but is he a reliable narrator? Can we believe him? Or is he just a murderous delinquent?
THE BANKER: A fat, greedy fool with a monster wife. One day he just grabs the bank's money and skedaddles out of town. This character is thinner than cardboard, no motivations except for childish greed and stupidity.
THE DOCTOR: May the good Lord help you if you get sick and need medical help from this pathetic substance abuser. He's always drunk, except when he's delivering a baby. And then quite suddenly he becomes Sir Lancelot, the protector of innocent womanhood and the shining image of chivalry. Fun to watch, but I don't believe it.
THE SOUTHERNER: Obviously John Carradine fought on the wrong side in the Civil War. In other words, he risked his life to defend the disgusting abomination of human slavery. And yet he's the most polished gentleman in the movie. In fact, the only real gentleman. Kind of like the good Nazi, right?
THE CAVALRY OFFICER: As head of a troop of horse soldiers, responsible for maintaining order in a brutal land. And yet he's presented as a green kid, shy and stammering, almost helpless. One more authority figure torn down and disrespected.
THE WHISKEY SALESMAN: Totally and improbably helpless! Such a nebbish would be eaten alive in the old West.
THE STAGECOACH DRIVER: An obese figure of low comedy, a babbling big-bellied clown. And yet this engaging stupidity has to be a phony act, because such a fool wouldn't have lasted six months on the frontier. Not to be trusted. Probably cheats at cards.
THE INDIANS (pardon me, the NATIVE AMERICANS): Of course they attack the stagecoach, but this has to be the most incompetent Indian attack ever staged. If you really want to stop a stagecoach, you just shoot the horses. Bang bang bang and it's all over. But instead our Native American friends ride patiently alongside the stagecoach and wait to be blasted off their ponies, one by one. Hey, it's my turn to get killed now! And finally, with a great noise of bugles, the cavalry JUST HAPPENS to ride up. In a million square miles of wilderness, the horse soldiers are by some unexplained accident in exactly the right place at exactly the right time. Yeah, okay, and I have a very nice bridge I'd like to sell you.

The real ending of the story is terribly pathetic. The jailbird and the whore are sent off into the sunset, apparently on their way to a little ranch in Mexico that the Ringo Kid improbably owns. So what the heck are they going to do in Mexico in the midst of a hostile population that hates anglos? I'll tell you the real ending. A year later the Ringo Kid lies fatally wounded in their adobe hut, shot by bandits who just stole all their cattle. And the prostitute is packing up to move to a whorehouse in Tampico where she can at least get a hot bath. That's the real ending to the story and don't you doubt it.

This movie is a brilliant end run around the Hollywood code and the Hays office. And yet maybe John Ford tried a little too hard to make fun of the ordinary people, the plain little folks like you and me who make the world run. H.L. Mencken used to preach that everybody was a boob except for himself. John Ford seems to be telling this exact same story, and that's why I think there's a bad smell hovering over this brilliant film.",1268438400,19,4670,4.570405727923628

UPDATE Review.
After viewing only the feature the other evening, I do have some observations that I would like to share.
First and foremost, the actual video quality of the blu-ray doesn't appear to my eyes to be a marked improvement over previous dvd versions; while Criterion has a proven track record of meticulous transfers, alas the newly discovered 1942 nitrate duplicate negative of Stagecoach, while an improvement over pre-existing negatives, still has so many scratches, nicks and debris, that viewers expecting a miracle on par with the blu-ray version of Casablanca, will be sorely disappointed. Indeed, I found myself paying more attention to the film source, rather than enjoying the film.
The good news is that Stagecoach still delivers. The dialogue, direction and scenery are still Ford's masterpiece. The extras, including a rare 1917 Ford silent feature, Bucking Broadway and an audio commentary by Jim Kitses and much, much more, make this version of Stagecoach a worthy addition to anyone's video library.",1268092800,32,1627,5.093632958801498

892724,5,6304457316,"There are endless reviews extolling the merits of this famous film, a landmark of sorts in 1939, much imitated but in fact, not quite the trendsetter which might be concluded. All the cliches for westerns abound but the quality of the acting and the direction are what makes it special. The film made John Wayne an A feature star after years toiling in Z grade westerns and he certainly has presence even if his acting is still immature. Claire Trevor and Thomas Mitchell are the standouts and Mitchell won a deserved Oscar.

What makes this DVD really special, other than the restored but not perfect print, is that this a 2 disc edition with some great extras:

- a first rate commentary by Scott Eyman which is easy on the ear and full of insight into the maverick director John Ford and his technique.
- a detailed documentary exploring the complex relationship and rich legacy of the collaboration of Ford and Wayne
- a further documentary on the film itself some of which is covered in the commentary

There is also a radio adaption but that holds little interest because that medium can not capture the filming techniques which lift this film above its obvious cliches.

The DVD is good value, expecially if purchased as part of a John Wayne collection.",1261526400,2,1260,4.6877828054298645
892725,5,6304457316,"John Ford was a man of few words and concise images.  Let it suffice to say that this film is one of the works which may come to define America for all time.  It will be a fine monument.

Added: 2012.  Apart from being the ultimate patriot, John Ford was the ultimate progressive liberal.  We see this clearly in the characters of ""Stagecoach"" and how Ford presents them.  Nearly every one is shown as a dimensionalized, complex human being.  But there is at least one exception: the caricature of the corrupt banker who rants against government regulations even as he steals gold may have been added in support of Roosevelt and the new deal, but its message resounds just as freshly in 2012.  When the banker declares that we need ""a businessman as president"" he might as well be caricaturing Mitt Romney and everyone at Fox News.  The sexual morality, here, too, is a direct attack on the kind of moralizing evangelicals who disgust every true patriot when they defile the first ammendment with their foul, life-hating ""morality.""  Ford shows the temperance ladies as witches and the ""good soldier's"" wife as a mean spirited small minded (and spiritually unfaithful) mouse who only finds humanity through her own suffering-- and the assistance of two ""sinners:"" a drunk and a prostitute.

The good people?  They are the outcasts here: a ragtag group of outsiders who help each other despite their flaws and who ultimately come together in community.  One might say the film is an allegory about the Democratic Party somehow coming together in awkward grace, raising up the meek--  despite the corrupt, murderous soul of the GOP that trumpets gold through false declarations of morality-- and forces the law into the awkward position of hunting down both the noble savages and the white man's truest hero: Ringo.  The false ""civilization"" of the GOP: the bible and the sword-- these are the true villains of Stagecoach.

It's well known that John Ford personally ended the McCarthy witchhunt (by attacking arch conservative film hack C.B. DeMille) and opened the door to the blacklisted writers to come back to work.  It is less known how clearly his progressive liberal politics are etched into America's finest embodiment of its highest values.  This film should make every right winger fall on one of his own poison tipped arrows.

America--at her best-- has always embodied progressive ideals.  ""Stagecoach,"" America's purest and noblest work of movie art, proves it.",1260230400,,2472,4.968369829683699

892727,3,6304457316,"The film opens on a road in the southwest. Two riders gallop into an Army post. The Apaches are on the warpath, led by Geronimo. [No reason given.] The coach stops to change their six horses. The conversation introduces the characters. ""What's good for the banks is good for the country."" [Does the banker resemble President Harding?] Dallas is driven out of town by the good women to avoid a calamity. Doc Boone hasn't done well. Cavalry escorts the stagecoach to guard against attack. The banker hops aboard. Johnny Ringo hitches a ride. They proceed through Monument Valley. Shall they continue without a cavalry escort? They take a vote. ""What difference does it make?"" Seating at the table shows their status.

The banker spouts political slogans that are still relevant (and wrong) today. They take a detour north for safety and learn bad news. Mrs. Mallory faints and needs medical attention. ""It's a baby!"" Ringo must carry on the family feud. We learn more about the people and their concerns. [Too sentimental?] Smoke on the mountain sends a signal. The stress affects the people. The next stop reveals a burned house and ferry. They get across the stream and continue. An arrow announces the Apache attack, the chase begins. [That wasn't much of an ambush! Would the clever Apaches attack in the open?] Will the cavalry arrive in the nick of time? The survivors arrive in town. ""Johnny Ringo is in town."" Luke's hand had aces and eights. The telegraph was repaired and the Sheriff greets banker Gatewood.

Ringo is given his ten minutes. The men in the bar await the news. Three men look for Ringo in the dark. Shots are heard, a woman screams. Ringo returns to the Marshal, and meets Dallas again. There is a surprise for a happy ending. The film reflects the culture of that era and hasn't aged bacly. Ringo had knocked around enough to know what Dallas was and wouldn't care anyway. [Too sentimental?]

Ernest Haycox wrote many popular Western novels, some adapted to films. This is a story of clichs about a group of people who are thrown together, face a peril, and live through it. How did it compare to the other western movies from that era? Few have survived to be placed on tape or disc. Was it more censored in some respects and less in others? I think remakes of this fil will drop the banker and pregnant wife due to cultural changes. John Wayne played in many westerns before this film.",1256428800,,2411,4.695035460992908
892728,3,6304457316,"This is about a stagecoach trip, but the movie might as well be ""on rails.""  The plot is predictable in the extreme, and the characters are one dimensional.

There's a drunken doctor who sobers up at the crucial moment and comes through in spades.  Etc.  Subtlety is not to be found here.

The one redeeming quality is the almost poetic cimematography at times.  As was often the case, director Ford used Monument Valley as a backdrop.  In fact, the stage never quite gets out of the valley, town after town.  Still, the backdrop is spectacular and wonderfully filmed.

I realize that this movie is revered as a cinema classic, but I don't understand why.  Westerns of the era were so predictable, mostly B movies and Saturday matinee fare for the kiddies.  Later westers would improve to give us ""The Ox Bow Incident,"" and ""True Grit"" and best of all ""Lonesome Dove.""

The movie is about a group of passengers that travel by a stagecoach under the threat of a possible apachi attack. The final shootout scene is very short but quite exciting.
The director John Ford proves his extraordinary talent by creating such a great movie under the limited technical and technological circumstances of the 1930s. He deserves the highest praise not only for his directing skills but also, for his decisiveness in giving the role of Ringo Kid to the young John Wayne although the big Hollywood studios turned him down because of this insistence.
John Wayne shines like a star throughtout the movie. In fact, he has reached the star status through this movie and has become a legendary actor through his future works.
On the other hand, Thomas Mitchell garnered an Oscar at the Best Supporting Actor category for his bright performance in Stagecoach.

All the diverse elements of the genre are present in this one movie, each waiting to be probed and dissected in the future, not only by other filmmakers, but by Ford himself.

STAGECOACH introduced the public to the Duke, John Wayne, and in every film he made thereafter you can find a bit of the Ringo Kid in each of his roles. The characters in STAGECOACH may be a bit too stereotypical or cliched for some tastes, a criticism applied to many Ford films, but the acting in this film is uniformly excellent. Aside from Wayne, Claire Trevor, John Carradine, Thomas Mitchell, Andy Devine, George Bancroft, and Donald Meek, are outstanding.

A hallmark of Ford's work is great pacing, and STAGECOACH is purposeful in it's demand for the viewers' attention from start to finish. There is very little waste or extraneous action and dialogue. Each sequence fits together in a seamless chain that moves the story forward to it's dynamic conclusion.

It's been made more than once, but I don't think it's been made better.  This is a classic in every sense of the word.  John Wayne in one of his earliest movies plays the Ringo Kid or just Ringo to my friends.

A confederate gambler, an alcoholic ex-Union doctor, a woman of ill-repute with a heart of gold,  a crooked banker, a whiskey drummer with samples and a fat and happy driver sitting next to the town marshal riding shotgun  going through Indian territory with Geronimo on the war Path all make up a classic movie.

Curly Wilcox (George Bancroft) is escorting outlaw Ringo Kid (John Wayne) to jail. Driver Buck (Andy Devine) leads the way as this diverse group aims for a common goal: to get to Lordsburg alive.

I am not normally a western fan. The barren landscapes and the rough characters are not my cup of tea. However, this film features a cast of characters that are very similar to any ordinary dramatic classic. There are outcasts like Dallas and Ringo, character actor parts like that of Doc Boone and Mr. Peacock, and straight parts like Mrs. Mallory or Curly. It is the characters that make this film truly great. However, they are aided by wonderful scenery in Monument Valley, Utah; expert editing; and an interesting take on a standard genre.

This is the film that made Wayne a star, and it is no wonder why. For a man characterized by his minimalist acting strategy, his talents run a wide gamut here. He is appropriately clueless in some scenes, strong in others, and romantic in still others. It is an impressive performance by any standards, and even moreso based on the work Wayne did previous to Stagecoach. Other notables include Mitchell who won an Oscar for his role. He is excellent comic relief, but also a sympathetic character.

Stagecoach has it all: action, romance, and craft!",1202601600,3,1861,4.958333333333333
893052,4,6304457316,"This wasn't the first ever western and in fact, director John Ford had a hard time convincing studio execs to let him make yet another western and even resisted the casting of John Wayne as the leading man.  Thankfully, they failed and what we have is the definitive western and the one that set the standard for all subsequent westerns.  We have attacks by Indians, a gunfight, the cavalry charge, romance and a lesson about hypocrisy and about class struggle/discrimination.  These are some of the qualities that I really miss in today's movies which seem to be superficial and morally bankrupt.

The acting of the superb cast is excellent and I was very impressed by the score as well.  The only negatives are the very sparse special features which consist of just trailers and the poor visual and sound quality which is in the original mono.

This is a great movie but perhaps this is not the best dvd version to view it from.

893054,5,6304457316,"Consider that Orson Welles carefully studied Stagecoach, then hired its cinematographer (Gregg Toland) for Citizen Kane.

Consider, too, that both John Ford and his financial backers spared no expense in hiring a first-rate troupe of actors and behind-the-camera talent.

And finally, consider that Stagecoach helped legitimize the Western as an art form, when previously it was largely seen as simply a reliable cash cow for studios with too many B-level actors on the payroll.

John Ford knew well what was needed and what he was up against in the battle for theater screens in 1939. He needed a film that exhibitors could profitably show in a year when Gone With The Wind was just one of a dozen top-flight attractions in a nation mired deep in the Great Depression.

He delivered, and Stagecoach is still as entertaining today as it was some 60 years ago. For those who don't like Westerns, Stagecoach is still a lesson in how to craft a classic film. The short story Last Stage to Lordsburg was expanded to fill the 35mm frame, but the original plot was not gutted. Ford knew enough not to ruin a perfectly good tale, so he matched his actors to the characters.

As a result, the cast of pros delivers. Abetted by terrific stuntmen and top-flight technicians and film crew (you'll be hard-pressed to notice any technical flaws), Ford produced a Western that that helped define the popular conception of the American West, for better or for worse.

In a later film, one of Ford's characters says ""...this is the West; when the legend becomes fact, print the legend.""

That's what Ford does in Stagecoach, in aces.",1196035200,3,1617,4.815884476534296
893055,5,6304457316,"In 1939, the modern adult Western was created when director John Ford collaborated for the first time with B-movie cowboy actor John Wayne in STAGECOACH. But although this film would catapult Wayne to A-list stardom, it is really an ensemble piece of the highest quality. This was also the first collaboration between John Ford and Monument Valley, where he was destined to return time and time again throughout his career.

In STAGECOACH, John Ford introduces a number of stock character types that nevertheless resist falling into cliche due to the fine story that he is telling here and the standout performances from this cast. The premise is a stagecoach journey through hostile territory which throws together a disparate group of travellers who, each with their own stories and problems, grow closer due to the trials and difficulties of this journey.

Ford consistently has great supporting actors in all his films, and STAGECOACH is particularly blessed. Claire Trevor plays Dallas, the fallen woman with a heart of gold who has been run out of town along with Doc Boone, the flamboyantly alcoholic doctor played brilliantly by the wonderful Thomas Mitchell. Wayne plays the Ringo Kid who has recently broken out of jail with vengeance on his mind. John Carradine plays Hatfield, the courtly Southern gambler and Louise Platt is Lucy Mallory, the pregnant Southern wife of a cavalry officer intent on joining her husband at his post. Donald Meeks plays Peacock, the small, meek whiskey drummer heading back to Kansas City to rejoin his wife and kids and Berton Churchill plays Gatewood, the pompous corrupt banker who has embezzled his banks funds and is running away from his shrewish wife. Gatewood is the only character who remains aloof from the rest of the group throughout the journey. Rounding out the ensemble are George Bancroft as the marshall taking Ringo back to jail and Andy Devine as the rotund, comic stage driver.

In my opinion, the standout star of the ensemble is Mitchell, who was arguably the most accomplished actor in the cast at the time the film was made. His heavily nuanced portrayal of the drunken, disgraced doctor who shows his true mettle and gains redemption by the end is outstanding. 1939 was a busy year for Mitchell, with supporting roles in ONLY ANGELS HAVE WINGS, MR SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, and, especially, GONE WITH THE WIND. But significantly, he won his Oscar that year for STAGECOACH.

Another star of this movie is the beautiful black and white cinematography of Bert Glennon. It is interesting to note that Orson Welles studied STAGECOACH extensively prior to shooting CITIZEN KANE. Some of Glennon's techniques such as deep focus photography and low-angle interior shots showing ceilings (actually stretched muslin) would show up in spades in KANE. John Ford himself would further develop this style when he worked with legendary cinematographer Gregg Toland in THE GRAPES OF WRATH and THE LONG VOYAGE HOME. Toland, of course, would go on to shoot CITIZEN KANE for Welles.

STAGECOACH is a perfectly satisfying cinematic experience even if it is a bit simplistically optimistic for my tastes, unlike the later, more complex Ford films. Also, the John Ford directorial ""style"" (the longer takes and resistance to cutting in of close-ups) is not as firmly established here as it would later become. For these reasons, there are other John Wayne, John Ford movies that I like better. But STAGECOACH remains an absolute essential to any fan of the Western, of John Ford, and of John Wayne.

893155,5,6304457316,"It's hard to believe that no one has commented on this immortal film yet! Am I missing something? Did everyone comment on an earlier dvd version!? Anyways...Onto my thoughts and observations.

Like my title states, (and I believe many would agree), this is indeed the most important film ever made in the western genre. In 1939, with the release of this film, John Ford and his cast changed the course of the western film and forever established credibility within the genre. In a time when the Hollywood western was never considered by critics or the general public as a serious and mature genre, when it was a genre of cartoonish B-movies, serials, and cowboy ""shoot 'em ups,"" it was a risk for Ford to try to encapsulate his brand of social commentary and character development into the film. What was more of a risk was casting the unknown B-movie veteran John Wayne in the lead, a move which made it difficult for Ford to find financial backing for his movie. But what a movie it is! It gave us an actor in Wayne that would come to be a living, breathing icon of Americana, and it gave us a genre that would continue to shape and define a part of American mythology: the myth of the West.

The film's seemingly simple structure, that of a stage with passangers of various social backgrounds and temperaments, actually allows for Ford to analysis and critique various aspects of social and community structures, roles, value, and worth, all within the context of an exciting tale of romance, danger, and revenge. Each character has an initial place in the social standing. The characters of Lucy (Louise Platt) and Gatewood (Berton Churchill), for example, occupy high positions in their society as distinguished citizens. John Wayne's fugitive character, the Ringo Kid, and the characters of Dallas (Claire Trevor) and the drunken Doc Boone (Thomas Mitchell, who won an oscar), possess low social status and are looked down upon by the characters of higher status. As the story develops, however, the concept of role reversal takes shape as these three characters prove their value and worth in the role or the skill that each is able to use to help other characters, particularly those of the higher social status. Ringo fulfills the role of a fighter, Dallas as a nurturing maternal presence for the laboring Lucy, and Boone as a doctor, and each is then valued higher as the social structure becomes a functioning community.

All of this is so well conceived visually by the brilliant direction of Ford, and by the equally superb work of the ensemble cast, that it flow with a clinical precision and maintains a unity of tone throughout. It reaches for and so effortlessly achieves a thematic complexity, exploring human interactions (both good and bad), social roles, and community achievement, while always maintaing a sense of conflict, imminent danger, suspense, and, above all else, entertainment. Set against the magnificent backdrop of Monument Valley, which would become Ford's cinematic legacy, the film is given both an epic scope and a sense of poetic and mythic adventure. It is one for the ages, indeed! And it was just the beginning of what the legendary duo of Ford & Wayne would achieve together....",1184803200,5,3223,4.888482632541133

893157,5,6304457316,"It's only a ""western"" because it takes place in a western setting. It's a drama, like ""Lifeboat"" is a drama. You wouldn't call ""Lifeboat"" a war movie.

I have nothing to add to the praise that so many others have given ""Stagecoach."" Instead, I'll add a few observations, pro and con.

The characters are stereotypes. But they are beautifully defined and superbly acted stereotypes. It's not important whether they are ""realistic"" or not. The point is, they serve the dramatic story, which is the whole point of having characters at all.

The army officer's wife is a wimp. She's supposed to be army, for crying out loud. If I were that officer, I'd dump her.

There's also something strange about the movie not telling us she's pregnant until she actually gives birth.

In the chase scene, the Clair Trevor character gets to do a little shooting, rather than standing by and screaming while the men do the fighting, as is so often the case in films.

But earlier in the movie, after she has sat up all night with the ailing officer's wife, the sleeping men awake and immediately ask HER to make THEM some coffee. Pul-eeze! Was the script writer asleep, too?

And then of course, there are the Apaches, beautifully portrayed by Navajo extras from the Monument Valley area. No whites in darkface here.

But alas, the usual one-sided battle ensues, with the cowboy marksmen effortlessly picking off the pursuing Apaches. Come on!

First of all, though John Wayne uses a rifle, the others use handguns. It's almost impossible to hit anything accurately at a distance with a handgun, not to mention when firing from from a jouncing stagecoach at rapidly shifting targets.

Second, real Apaches of that period, exceptional fighters and tacticians, would never have chased the stagecoach from BEHIND and exposed themselves so stupidly. They would have intercepted it from in front, and the whites would have been easy pickings.

Another reviewer asked why the Apaches didn't simply shoot the horses to stop the stage. The film doesn't deal with that question, but the right answer would have been that the horses were more valuable to them than the stage or the people in it. Shooting the horses would have rendered the attack itself a bit pointless.

The cavalry coming to the rescue is an embarrassing clich, but it is somewhat saved by the beautifully framed deep shot, a John Ford trademark, of the stage slowly coming to stop as it approaches the camera, while the soldiers recede into the distance chasing the Apaches.

I never tire of watching this film. I can say that of few others.",1180310400,,2584,4.819004524886878
893158,4,6304457316,"Stagecoach (John Ford, 1939)

Both John Ford and John Wayne had made nearly one hundred films by the time of Stagecoach, but this is the one almost universally regarded as the movie that catapulted both to the status of legends. Deservedly so; I'd say this is one of the five best westerns I've ever seen.

The plot seems simple enough: a stagecoach has to get from point A to point B, with the path travelling through Geronimo's territory, and he's not a happy guy right now. There is, however, a great deal more to it than that; one of the stagecoach's passengers is the wife of an officer who's fighting Geronimo, and the motley band of characters riding in it end up not just going from point A to point B, but C, D, and E as well, with various escapades along the way. It's the western version of a Bunuel film, but with tension mixed into the absurdity. This is not an idle comparison; a lot of the seemingly extraneous shots Ford uses should put one in mind of Bunuel's later work.

The characters, also, are a far cry from what one would expect in such movies. The entire core cast is well-developed and three-dimensional; no one is here just for comic relief, or just to be the action hero. Everyone has a backstory, and it informs each character. That's still rare today; back then it was groundbreaking.

If you've never seen Stagecoach, I recommend giving it a look. Even if you're not fond of westerns, this one's got something to offer. ****",1178841600,,1455,4.5

893162,5,6304457316,"Stagecoach is a black and white classic ""disparate strangers tossed together"" kind of story - and this is the original 1939 version starring John Wayne. You've got all sorts on the stagecoach - Wayne as the goodhearted outlaw out for revenge, a sweet prostitute, a high-class lady, a southern gentleman gambler, a drunkard doc, and so on.

Each person has their own motivation for going on the stagecoach - most are escaping one thing or another in the town. The problem is that the Apaches are out causing trouble, being stirred up by Geronimo. They're told this by another indian - apparently ""The Cheyenne hate Apaches worse than we do"". One of the hotels in town is named the ""Tonto Hotel"". Lone Ranger lovers will enjoy the reference. Rumor has it that the friend of the Lone Ranger was named after the Spanish word for ""fool"".

Soon of course there are Indian troubles for the travelers. They head up higher into the hills because, as one of the men wryly comments, ""those beach crowd Apaches don't like snow."" The only real Apache they run into is the ""squaw"" wife of a local Mexican trader. She's one of Geronimo's people - but she sings Spanish song and wears a Spanish looking blanket. She also takes off as soon as she can, and her loss isn't missed much by her husband. He regrets the horse she took more than her loss!

The movie packs a lot into under two hours. First, the scenery - even though it's in black and white - is simply gorgeous. No wonder westerns became such a popular genre, with the fascinating rock formations and wide open skies.  Next, the characters are great. You really feel each person has a history, a complex character. The banker is all bluster - but something drove him to betraying his business and taking off with the money, deserting his wife and profession. Characters that start the movie believing in something strongly are often made wiser by the end.

Anyone looking to this to get any sense of what the natives were like back in the wild west won't get much to learn from. Most of the time the Indians are represented by an arrow flying in a window or a scary noise outside the window.  The Indians are a faceless, ever-present menace.

On the other hand it's really amazing that this film from 1939 survived this long, in any form. It was very nearly lost. It is great to watch this version and then the 1966 remake with Ann-Margret and Bing Crosby.

893221,5,6304457316,"The remarkable thing about Ford's Westerns is his gift for simultaneously contemplating people as individuals and as representatives of virtues, vices, and other abstract qualities...

""Stagecoach"" is the Western to combine successfully the poetic grandeur and sense of myth-making of the real and imagery West with pure entertainment values... It is the Western in which the public first saw Monument Valley, Utah on film - a place that Ford would revisit again and again, and that became his favorite location for the exterior sequences of his Westerns... It is the first Western to combine successfully the poetic grandeur and sense of myth-making of the real and imaginary West with pure entertainment values... It is so rich it has become a treasury of Western characters and motifs... Prior to 'Stagecoach,' the western was in grievous decline, but with 'Stagecoach' a renaissance occurred...

""Stagecoach"" makes much capital out of an early means of communication... Ford used it as a symbol - there is nothing more striking, as an image of loneliness, than a long-shot of a coach twisting its way through the arid and dry South-Western landscape - but also as a box for shaking and mixing human drama... The combination is devastating... Despite some complaining criticism that there is just a little too much contrivance about the selection of passengers riding in the 'box', that they look as if they've been handpicked for contrast and for drama, ""Stagecoach"" always repays another look... It still works admirably... Time takes little away from it...

Everything seems to fit in ""Stagecoach"" from the first moment that the camera races in on the imposing figure of John Wayne, a man of heroic size with a powerful stance, twirling his Winchester rifle in one hand to the gallery of colorful portraits in a shaking box to the dramatic black and white photography taking advantage of every trick of light and shade including cloudscapes and silhouettes...

Ford carefully selected 'characters' boxed in for a troublesome ride... They are not characters, save perhaps for the drunken doctor, in the usual Ford sense of beloved eccentrics... They are highly contrasted 'types' who, by some alchemy that the movie develops, do grow to some extent into credible human beings...

Apart from the drunken Doc (superb1y played by Thomas Mitchell), there's the mysterious southern gambler (John Carradine), a pregnant wife (Louise Platt) joining her soldier husband, a Whisky salesman (Donald Meek) who could kid anyone at first sight--especially an audience--that he's a parson, a whore with a heart of gold (Claire Trevor), and an absconding banker (Barton Churchill). Andy Devine is in the driving seat, George Bancroft, as a U.S. Marshal, rides shot-gun and keeps a wary though fatherly eye on the Ringo Kid (john Wayne) who has come along for at least part of the ride...

Two things are at once apparent... Ford is employing a dramatic device for which there is plenty of precedent--compressing diverse characters into a confined and highly charged situation in the certainty of reactions, and, secondly, that the Claire Trevor character is the spitting image, as they say, of Maupassant's tart, Boule de Suife...

Geronimo will be the catalyst for this load of combustibles... He's on the loose again and the escorting cavalry have already had to say their farewells to the coach party...

Along the way you will also see: The birth of a child, the telegraph lines cut, an attack by Indians, a chase, a cavalry rescue, a poker game, a three-against-one gunfight on the streets of a town, and an exciting climax...

""Stagecoach"" leaves a whole host of abiding impressions... There is the dramatic black and white photography taking advantage of every trick of light and shade in the wonderful Monument Valley location... It was the first time that Ford had used this setting within the Navajo Indian reservation around and about the Arizona-Utah state dividing line... The eroded lunar landscape has its own beauty and its own menace and these two qualities are reflected in the film... Cloudscapes and silhouettes--these linger on.

""Stagecoach"" bulged with all the required ingredients of the classic Western... It carried a full complement of the historic-pioneering elements and it also made room for that other constituent, the domestic law and order issue...",1162857600,6,4371,5.1784702549575075

On top the stagecoach is driver (Andy Devine) with the sheriff (George Bancroft) riding shotgun. Inside the coach are dance hall girl (Claire Trevor) being run out of town, a crooked banker (Berton Churchill) and others all with good reason for going to Lordsburg, a drunken doctor (Thomas Mitchell) A pregnant lady (Louise Platt) and her sworn protector a southern ""gentleman"" (John Carradine) and last but not least a most unlikely looking whiskey drummer (Donald Meek) along the way they pick up a horseless ""Ringo Kid""

The Kid has broken out of prison and is out for vengeance on the Plummer brothers who had killed his father and brother but first they have to run the gauntlet of Geronimo and his band of Apache Indians on the warpath - The brilliant chase across the salt flats started off when an arrow thuds into Donald Meeks shoulder out-of-blue.

The DVD review

 Let's start with the good it's a great movie, even for it age it just fun to watch. My kids really got into it. It stars John Wayne as a man who has escaped from prison to avenge his father and brothers killers. Along the way he meets up with a cast of characters whom set the story in motion of course on a stagecoach running from Native Americans who are out to get them. Plus it's not a flip case that's always a plus.

The Video:

 Sadly they did not clean it up. If Stagecoach doesn't deserve the Disney treatment I don't know a film that does. It goes out of focus here and there and has a light flicker. It's not the Green Beret flicker but it's no Rio Grande that's for sure.

The Audio

2.0 Of course it will be nice when the audio catches up to the video ability to clean up.

The Extras

Here where the DVD Shines though if you already own the movie I suggest you wait 6 months till it hits 5.50 at Wal-Mart.

893225,4,6304457316,"This terrific double-disc version of the restored ""Stagecoach"" includes commentary from John Ford biographer Scott Eyman, who says: ""The modern Western begins here.""

Images from the trailer and docu clips give a pretty good idea of what the restorers were up against with ""best available film elements."" Video quality is OK despite the wear. Audio gets by.

Eyman delivers his talk flat, lecture-style, but provides plenty of detail and thoughtful analysis. He says Ford rescued John Wayne from the B-movie mill of Republic Pictures because the director ""sensed Wayne could command a scene simply by entering it."" To make sure, Ford gave Wayne one of the great entrances in screen history, using a dramatic dolly shot to rush up on the cocky Ringo Kid. Still, Wayne was Ford's favorite target for tirades, and ""Ford kept picking on Wayne for 34 years,"" Eyman says. (As Peter Bogdanovich puts it, ""There was a certain tension on a Ford set, to put it mildly."")

The men's tense yet affectionate and enduring relationship is chronicled in the recent ""American Masters"" profile ""The Filmmaker and the Legend,"" included as an extra. The informative (but padded) docu runs 90 minutes. (It contains numerous spoilers.) The 2006 half-hour docu ""Stagecoach: A Story of Redemption"" includes testimony from Bogdanovich, who dubs it ""the first psychosexual Western.""",1149552000,6,1356,5.2110091743119265

  john ford's stagecoach is one of his best works and the template for all westerns to follow. it might feel like you have seen all this in a million other movies,but this was the first.

 the story of a group of people on a stage to the town lordsburg is a great character study of people under stress and how the good in people is on the inside and that some people who look nice are just the opposit in real life. the action is fast and the story is just the best. won oscers for music score and for thomas mitchell as the drunken doctor who is quick witted and quick drinking man who finds himself again as the trip goes along. belongs in every collection of the greatest movies ever made",1145318400,2,843,4.115853658536586

Add one bad girl (Claire Trevor) driven our of town with the drunken doc by the town's respectable marm hens, and one cuffed outlaw, the Ringo Kid (John Wayne.)  Shake vigorously in a stagecoach plunging violently through hostile Apache territory.

 Made in 1939, the Year of the Motion Picture, John Ford's STAGECOACH is pretty much everything you want or need in a western.  Nominated for a slew of Academy Awards, it took one home when Thomas Mitchell won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor as the shrewd, whiskey-loving physician.  In 1995 it was placed on the National Film Registry by the National Film Preservation Board.

 Well, this is the first film Ford shot in Monument Valley, and it looks great.  It's also one of the first big-movie breaks for Wayne.  Check out the first Wayne shot - the camera eagerly rushes up to him and holds him in a wide-eyed close-up for a couple of seconds. An entrance worthy of an icon, even if Ford was a couple of decades premature.  And the always reliable, underrated Claire Trevor looks great as... well, I'm not quite sure what she is, though she dresses well and the respectable folks drive her away when they can, shun her when they can't.  In fact, the only thing that doesn't look all that marvelous on the Warners' 1997-released dvd is the print itself, which is scratchy in some spots and muddy and murky in others.  Not terribly so, but c'mon, Warner Brothers.  You'll throw scrubbers, cleaners, and polishers and a host of long-winded commentators at suspect crime thrillers if they have `Film Noir' stamped on the front cover.  How's about throwing some love and attention to an undisputed classic?  As long as this one remains the only one available I strongly recommend it, although it truly deserves a full-scale restoration.",1134086400,69,2087,4.787709497206704

Director John Ford achieved that by emphasizing character developement over action though the film does contain some thrilling sequences.  For sure the film does contain a number of Western archetypes(the gambler, the prostitute with a heart of gold, etc.) but they transcend the stereotypes.  ""Stagecoach"" is also significant as the film that broke John Wayne to mainstream audiences.  Wayne's entrance as the Ringo Kid is the stuff of legends.  There is not a bum performance in the impressive cast that includes the underappreciated Claire Trevor as the social pariah, Dallas, and Thomas Mitchell as Doc Boone, for which he won an Oscar.

Positives, besides its relevance to film history, are a young John Wayne, wearing blue jeans even!  Also, this movie's repeated references to and depictions of the ""coach gun"" (the old sawed off double barreled shotgun that the stagecoach guard carried) helped make the gun famous.  Also, the Stagecoach scene when they are being chased by the Apaches will remind you of the Indiana Jones movies.  And if you think about what the stuntmen were doing, their work was amazing and quite dangerous.

893312,5,6304457316,"I am not a Western movie fan. Yet I stll watched Stagecoach because it represented the genre of the Western movies.

A stagecoach that travelled between the Western towns across the dry land and monumental rocks of Utah, with the marshall and soldiers to guard the passengers against the threat of the Indians, provided a simple storyline for the movie. The success of the movie was to bring together a convincingly batch of 9 (10 in the end) characters on the stagecoach - the driver Buck, upright Marshall Wilcox,  Lucy (the lady who was determined to reunite with her soldier husband) and her admirer Hatfeld (John Carradine), the good old man Mr. Peacock, Doc Boone (Thomas Mitchell whose last film was Pocketful of Miracles with Betty Davis), the selfish banker Mr. Gatewood,  Dallas (Claire Trevor) and the Ringo Kid on the run (a 32-year old John Wayne who looked convincingly young) who later joined the coach halfway.

Dallas (Claire Trevor)was looked down upon by fellow passengers because of her profession as much as Lucy was respected as a lady. And yet Ringo Kid courted Dallas as nobly as Hatfeld courted Lucy. Claire Trevor was perfect in the role. Doc Boone (Thomas Mitchell) was the drunkard who had lost his trade but proved as capable and sober as he could ever be when his medical skills were called for. Thomas Mitchell was excellent and deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actor in a supporting role. When he, alone and unarmed, dared the main villain not to take the shotgun outside to shoot the Ringo Kid, I feared that was the last of him.

The 2 great action sequences included the fierce battle between the men on the coach and the Indians across the dry land; one great stunt involved an Indian shot down by Ringo Kid and ran over by the 6 horses of the stagecoach. Another great scene  was when Ringo Kid intended to revenge for his father and brother - 1 against 3. It successfully created an atmosphere of suspense and anticpation - the men in the bar all stopped, stood aside and watched how the 3 prepared to go out to have a duel with Ringo Kid.

There was a good mix of romance, action, comradeship and upright characters in the film. The ending was a great twist. How Dallas could enjoy family life with Ringo the Kid in his home outside the border if Marshall Wilcox was to jail Ringo? For the good old times of the Western movies, this definitely is the one to watch.",1129248000,3,2404,4.589743589743589

The Toho company stopped producing these kinds of films a few years after this one. None of the aforementioned monsters are in this film, which is about a nasty space amoeba that rode to earth on a satelite bound for home.

Gone are the scenes of mass destruction in cities like Tokyo, Okinawa, and Hokaido. In its stead, are scenes of helpless island natives and tourists running around with spears and gas cans. Hmmmm... tanks, fighter jets, and rocket launchers have been useless with these types of monsters before.

It seems that the Yog-ster can inhabit the bodies of small aquatic creatures and make them gigantic. A giant turtle (uh, can you say Gamera rip-off!), a giant crab (not Ebirah, the giant lobster that fought Godzilla), and my favorite - Gazora, a giant walking octopus who looks like he was fashioned by slapping two mattresses together and then attaching some rubber legs and glooing on some ping-pong ball eyes. By the way, rumor has it that the budget was so lo on this one, that they opted not to fix the lighting of Gazora's eyes when they burned out half way through production, thus, in some scenes the eyes glow, and in some... they don't... And though it did come from the bankrupted film company American International, it wasn't a Roger Corman film. You get three monsters in Yog, but though the first shot of the film shows them all fighting one another for a few brief seconds, we do not get the grand battle of the the trio of titans. We get a short battle between the turtle and another crab (You'll know what I mean by that if you watch the film), but it is staged on a boring mountain and doesn't really get too exciting.

Then the strangest thing happens in the last half of the movie. Yog inhabits the body of a sleezy guy in a white leisure suit. My question here is the obvious one... then why didn't this guy turn into a giant monster in a white leisure suit. Now THAT would have been entertaining.

This movie is an uninspired rehash for only the die-hard daikaiju fan. It is kind of fun in its silliness and the actors do the best with what they have, (especially the guy in the leisure suit) but it is definitely ultra low low budget, so don't expect great costumes or effects. The best suit is the turtle Koemeba who is seen torn to shreds in the recent ""Godzilla : Tokyo SOS"", so I guess one of them did make it into a G film... well kind of.

Lastly, the best ingredient in this film, is its music by Akira Ifikube. The grand master of Japanese kaiju soundtracks turns in some nice music here, with some haunting monster and action themes. Sadly, and ironically the delicious music is wasted on a lackluster production.",1123891200,3,2827,4.502923976608187

They know Geronimo is out there but they each have reason to get to the next town. They are escorted by the sheriff and the stage driver.  Not far along the way, they meet up with the Ringo Kid (John Wayne), an escaped convict on his way to the same town to settle accounts with the crooks who framed him. He becomes an escort to the stage as well. Along the way, they fight each other, the desert and Geronimo's raiding Apaches. The cavalry shows up at the last minute to save the day.

893318,4,6304457316,"Prior to John Ford's ""Stagecoach,"" the Western was kid stuff, B-movie stuff, the kind of thing no one took very seriously in Hollywood or in the theaters across the land.  By the time this film had assembled this group of stock characters and Ford infused them, and the multilayered story, with the energy and vigor he became known for, the Western had grown up and risen to become a respectable genre.

What's more, Ford's choice of John Wayne changed the face of movies forever as well.  From his first moment on screen as the Ringo Kid, a dramatic and unforgettable closeup that suffers by today's standards only due to the technological inferiority of 65 years past, Wayne has immediately stepped up to star level.  (Modern equipment eliminates the bouncy, hard-to-focus camera that plagued many of the older films like this one, only to have some modern filmmakers bounce and/or unfocus the camera on purpose for artistic reasons.)

If only for those two things, the elevation of Wayne and the Western, ""Stagecoach"" will never be forgotten.  Having never been a huge fan of Westerns in general, and with this film having been made in the year my mother was born, I never went out of my way to see it until recently, when the NY Times list of 1000 best movies ever made came to my attention.  It centralized the list of old great films that I'd like to see more of, and ""Stagecoach"" is certainly one of those 1000.  It's a real pleasure to see such a young Duke, as well as the equally young John Carradine, the lovely Claire Trevor, and goofball Andy Devine, and to see Mr. Ford deftly handle a story that goes in several directions and coalesces with a surprise at the end.

""Stagecoach"" begins with about 10 minutes of nondescript, basic Western film nonsense that looks like nothing special is going on, but it gradually picks up steam and makes a case for being the finest classic Western ever made.  While I prefer ""High Noon"" for that title, I'll not argue for long with anyone who would choose this one.  ""Stagecoach"" is one of the film industry's treasures, and any fan of the movies needs to see it at least once.  Your education is incomplete otherwise.",1112918400,,2168,4.661417322834645

Leading them is gunslinger Wayne as the Ringo Kid. It's what's revealed beneath each character's surface personality that makes this movie special, though sometimes that can be shallow.

893385,5,6304457316,"A great adventure western that in many ways is comparable to the classic movie ""Lifeboat"". Like Lifeboat, a collection of people from different social levels are trapped together under great stress. Amongst the urban travelers is Ringo (Wayne) as the prison breaking  cowboy out to avenge the death of his brother. Old Doc Boone played by one of the greatest character actors of the period Thomas Mitchell, an alcoholic orator banned from the town. The beautiful Dallas, a good woman who is either a saloon girl or more obvious, a lady of the evening, forced into those labors purely due to economic hardship. The suspicious mysterious gambler Hatfield who was a confederate officr in the war but has a strange consuming chivalrous attitude for the high brow Captain's wife. The pregnant wife trying to reach her husband serving in the cavalry, the self confident elitist banker, the frightened but religous whiskey salesman (Doc Boone adopts),the tough Sheriff and the famous sidekick of all time, Andy Devine playing the not so bright but honest stagecoach driver. The movie is fascinating as the personalities divide up amongst their social classes with Wayne's great line after several patrons move away from Dallas, Wayne thinks he is the reason as he utters ""I guess you can't break out of prison and into society in the same week"". Great tension as the stagecoach moves further into Indian territory as they become more isolated as they constantly just miss the protective army. The end culminates into the great western climax of a tremendous Indian attack with the odds terribly against them as the stagecoach tries to flee. The big question, will the cavalry get there in time. But the movie is not over as the Ringo Kid (Wayne) still has a score to settle. Watch the main villan in the final scenes as he apparently appears more suited for silent films, he rarely speaks but does a lot more with physical acting and facial features. Aside from a wonderful thrilling action western, the film has great dialogue:

Doc Boone, ""Ringo didn't I fix your broken arm?""
Ringo, ""No that was my brother, you did a great job considering you was drunk""
Doc Boone beaming, ""Professional compliments are always pleasing""

The movie itself is a great character study.

Apache chief Geronimo is on the warpath making the trip that much more dangerous.  Will the stagecoach make it to Lordsburg before the Apaches cut off the road?  Along the way, the viewer gets to know the passengers, some more likable than others.  There is a reason this western is considered a classic.  Ford blends a great story, excellent characters, a fantastic score from Richard Hageman, impressive action scenes(especially when the Apaches chase the stagecoach across the desert) and beautiful cinematography of Monument Valley.  For a truly classic western, this is a safe bet.

  Claire Trevor gets top billing as Dallas, a saloon girl kicked out of town by the women's law and order society.  In the role that sent his career skyrocketing, John Wayne stars as the Ringo Kid, a framed outlaw tagging along on the stagecoach who is seeking revenge for his family's murders.  The image of Wayne yelling for the coach to hold up truly marked the beginning of an impressive career.  In an Academy Award winning performance, Thomas Mitchell plays Doc Boone, a drunk down-on-his-luck doctor.  Andy Devine and George Bancroft play Buck, the stage driver, and Curly, the sheriff riding shotgun.

This was one of those movies that had everything going for it.  The screenplay was terrific and enabled a most diverse range of characters to interact in a way that created a high level of human drama.  That was brought to screen under the excellent direction of Ford.  The actors were all well chosen and delivered outstanding performances.  Among the best were those of John Wayne, Donald Meek, Claire Trevor, John Carradine, Andy Devine, and Thomas Mitchell (who got the Best Supporting Actor Oscar in one of the toughest years ever).

The plot involves an unusual collection of individuals taking the stage to Lordsburg.  It includes a pregnant army officer's wife, an alcoholic doctor, a Southern gentleman gambler, a prostitute whose was being kicked out of town, a sober whiskey salesman, and a later traveler; the Ringo Kid (Wayne).  The Kid joins them after they've left town and is under the watchful eye of the the sherrif who's riding shotgun.  The immediate problem is getting past the Indians who are on the war path.  Along the way, each of the travelers is challenged to go beyond the person that they have become.  The crisis, in other words, brings out the best in all of them.  The journey is more climactic that then end but it has a uniquely Western finish.

Some movies really make a difference in an actor's career.  Just consider Jack Nicholson in ""Easy Rider"".  Ford had already established himself (he'd previously received and Oscar for Best Director for ""The Informer"") and his selection of ""B"" movie actor Wayne made a big difference in the history of Hollywood.

But more importantly is the idea that the good guys in the white hats versus the bad guys in the black hats was finally replaced by real human beings who have their strengths and weaknesses.  ""Stagecoach"" is about six passengers, the driver, a sheriff and an outlaw who joins them on their journey fleeing from their pasts and heading into an uncertain future (with Indians shooting at them too).
Wayne plays the Ringo Kid, who has been framed for a murder and is seeking the real killers; Claire Trevor plays Dallas, a prostitute fleeing her unhappy life; Thomas Mitchell is the courageous but alcoholic Dr. Josiah Boone; John Carradine is the gambler, Hatfield; Berton Churchill is Henry Gatewood, a banker who has embezzled a fortune; Donald Meek is Samuel Peacock, a mousy little salesman; Louise Platt is Lucy Mallory, a pregnant woman traveling to join her husband; Andy Devine is the stagecoach driver, Buck and George Bancroft is the tough but fair minded Sheriff Curly Wilcox.
""Stagecoach"" was filmed in what would prove to be Ford's favorite locale, Monument Valley, Utah. During their journey the personality of each character is revealed as Lucy gives birth, the stagecoach is attacked by Indians, and the Ringo Kid gets revenge on his enemies. A nice balance between character study and action, ""Stagecoach"" sets standards for how westerns should look and how characters should be real people. Wayne does not really stand out in this strong ensemble cast, but we can clearly see all the elements of the persona that would make him a screen legend.

The western genre wasn't taken very seriously, and neither was the young, sauntering cowboy who starred in them.  Stagecoach changed all that.  Director John Ford knew talent when he saw it, and with this film one of the greatest alliance/friendships in Hollywood history was formed--that of John Wayne and John Ford.  Out of this memorable alliance several wonderful films came, but this was the first.
Shot in Utah's beautiful Monument Valley, Stagecoach follows the adventures of a group of unlikely traveling companions as they cross the stage route in an effort to stay clear of Geronimo and his band.  Along the way, the group picks up the Ringo kid (Wayne), a confirmed killer.  As the journey progresses, the group's true colors come forth, a young prostitute who was driven from her home (played by Claire Trevor) becomes the true heroine, and the stuck-up aristocratic woman, the banker, and the whiskey peddler are forced to learn a valuable lesson--that true inner character is far more important than social status.
The movie itself is a masterpiece, from the brilliant storyline to the climactic ending with the Ringo Kid's battle in the street.  The cinematics are spectacular (especially for that time), and Ford's directing is flawless.  There have been many, many Westerns since this one (a great deal of them starring John Wayne), but no Western has ever changed the face of the motion picture industry like Stagecoach did.",1059696000,11,1536,5.067460317460317

893435,5,6304457316,"STAGECOACH is a film that is great viewed once, but even better watched repeatedly.  Although the story it tells is a simple one, it is told in a deceptively simple manner.  In fact, it is a heavily nuanced, deeply complex film, and it is only on repeated viewings that the complexity is revealed.  For instance, if one rewatches the film focusing on just one element, such as the physical distance and placement of each character throughout the film, one realizes the degree to which John Ford is the master of his craft.  This is one of those rare films that, if watched frequently enough, shows you how films are constructed and made.  In fact, ""Masterpiece"" is almost too weak a word for a work of this quality.  It is almost more ""Blueprint"" for future films than merely a Masterpiece.
STAGECOACH is sometimes regarded as a John Wayne vehicle, but nothing could be further from the truth.  He does manage a stunning debut in an ""A"" picture (his extensive previous work had been in ""B"" oaters), but this is an ensemble picture, the strength of the film deriving from the performances of a number of important characters, and not from the performance of merely one.  Had Wayne been great, but John Carradine and Donald Meek and Berton Churchill and Andy Devine and Thomas Mitchell not turned in equally as compelling performances, STAGECOACH would have been only a shadow of the film it is.  Although this is not a John Wayne vehicle, he does benefit from two visually stunning moments.  The first is the marvelous close up when we see the Ringo Kid for the first time.  The second is his dive to the ground at the end of the film as he takes on his enemies.
STAGECOACH is a nearly flawless film.  The cinematography is extraordinary.  Monument Valley, which Ford used here for the first time but which is now forever associated with his films, provides a perfect backdrop to the story.  As mentioned before, the large ensemble cast is flawless.  The script is classic.  The story utilizes the classic formula of a journey as symbolizing the changes in characters as the stagecoach goes on.  The music is memorable.  This is easily one of the most imitated movies in history, and watching it one can easily see why.
This movie also features one of the most famous stunts in the history of film.  During the climatic chase scene across the long desert plain, an Indian rides up and jumps off his horse onto the lead team of horses on the stagecoach.  John Wayne shoots him before he is able to rein in the horses and stop the coach, but the leads have fallen and are trailing the ground.  So, John Wayne apparently jumps from the coach to the second team of horses, and then from them to the lead horses, where he recovers the leads.  In fact, the same person, Yakima Canutt, did both stunts.  This sequence is so famous that it has been spliced into dozens of movies over the years.  When they filmed it Yakima first did the Indian stunt, and then dressed as John Wayne and then saved the stage.  It is on the basis of this as well as his later stunt work that Yakima Canutt is considered one of the great stunt artists ever.",1029024000,5,3128,4.562724014336918
893436,4,6304457316,"A favorite technique of Hollywood is to place a diverse group of strangers into a box of some sort, keep them there while danger appears, and then see how they relate.  Alfred Hitchcock in LIFEBOAT and John Hughes in THE BREAKFAST CLUB proved that locked in characters exhibit a range of emotions from gloom, to doom, to humor, to acceptance.  In STAGECOACH, director John Ford went to the Old West as a background against which several characters are all on the run for one reason or another.  On a stagecoach headed for Lordsburg, driver Buck (Andy Devine) picks up Gatewood (Berton Churchill), a crooked banker who has just embezzled his bank's money; a hooker Dallas (Claire Trevor), who needs the emotional flipside of a business notorious for a cash on the barrel philosophy; a wino Doctor Boone (Thomas Mitchell), who tries to drown his sorrows in whiskey; a glib but crooked gambler Hatfield (John Carradine), who measures all of life's risks by odds given and taken; a pregnant Lucy Mallory (Louise Platt); who seeks her husband who she feels sure will care for her and her child; a travelling salesman Sam Peacock (Donald Meek), who fears the danger of a world will intrude on his unassuming self; a sheriff Wilcox (George Bancroft), who hunts a man he is sworn to bring in; and of course the hunted man himself, the Ringo Kid (John Wayne), who seeks redemption through revenge for the murder of his family.
  What Ford has done was to place these riders in a volatile situation where their respective personalities emerge such that despite some obvious differences in temperament and character, each is resigned to co-operate in the face of a common enemy, Geronimo, the Apache chief, who swears to kill them all.  Even though John Wayne gets top billing, it is not he who occupies center stage.  Rather, there is a collective splicing of individuals so that each takes turns in joining the group consciousness that is needed for self-defense.  The climax is the protracted assault on the stagecoach by a band of Apaches who attack on horseback.  These Apaches do not emerge as distinct individuals.  We never learn more about them except that they are warlike and led by Geronimo.  As they attack, the riders shoot back, killing one Indian after another. One would think that after losing more than a dozen warriors in the initial assault (I was counting), Geronimo would have weighed cost versus benefit and called it all off. The attack itself is a masterpiece of filming.  The bouncing, jangling motion of the stagecoach is a palpable vibration felt viscerally by the audience.  With the riders' ammunition running out, the gambler Hatfield is down to his last bullet, and probably for the first time in his card-sharping days decides to give a [guy] an even break.  The young mother Lucy is praying to God for deliverance, but Hatfield knows that the Apaches will rape and torture her upon capture, so he resolves to use his last bullet mercifully on her.  Ironically, no one on board sees this as he is killed seconds before he can pull the trigger.  With further irony, a troop of US cavalry appears to chase away the Apaches. As the stagecoach pulls into Lordsburg, there is a series of happy endings.  The meek salesman recovers from a wound.  The crooked banker is found out and arrested. The tart Dallas and the Ringo Kid fall in love while Sheriff Wilcox allows them to ride off into the night together.
  STAGECOACH was not the first hit for John Wayne, but in its superb choreography, beauteous setting of Monument Valley, sparkling dialogue, and Ford's ability to allow his cast's respective and unique styles to bounce off each other, the result is a gripping movie that is truly far more than the John Wayne vehicle it is sometimes trumped up to be.  Instead, what it reveals is that in life-threatening situations, the power of the whole far exceeds the individual talents of each.  Co-operation, even among quarrels, can often spell the difference between success and failure on both the screen and in real life too.",1028073600,,4046,4.816473988439307
893437,5,6304457316,"While this movie retains many of the OLD style western film trademarks (indian chases, good guy, bad guy relationships), Stagecoach is where J. Wayne begins to develop real character depth.  The worst people (the drunk, the prostitute) are the dependable folks who take charge and get the job done when things get tough, and the respectable folks (army wife, banker) are really all talk, with no stomach for lifes realities.  This type of acting was new at the time, where characters actually worked to hide a part of what they were, which was different from their society-defined role in life.  More complex characters, and thus, more complex acting, sets the tone for both John Wayne's and Hollywoods future.  It was still shot in black and white, though, so don't expect great technological advances in film science or special effects.  You almost need to watch a couple of Wayne's earlier films before watching Stagecoach to really appreciate the difference.  If you watch his later films first, Stagecoach will seem like ""just another old movie"".",1025827200,3,1051,5.046242774566474
893438,5,6304457316,"""Stagecoach"" bears more than a passing resemblance to Bret Harte's famous western parable, ""The Outcasts of Poker Flats"", which is why it, like the short story, are both great classics. A major difference between the two, however, is that ""Stagecoach"" has an overall happy ending, whereas the poor outcasts suffer various tragic fates.
Our ""Stagecoach"" has a number of interesting inhabitants: The Ladies Decency League has managed to put aboard the town's drunk doctor (Thomas Mitchell) and a lady of ill repute (Claire Trevor). A mild-mannered whiskey drummer played to perfection by Donald Meek is of great interest to the doctor, who's more than happy to hold (and raid) the salesman's sample case en route to Lordsberg. A ""great lady"", expecting and off to join her calvary officer husband, is warned by the town biddies not to ride with that hussy Claire Trevor, but she goes anyway. The notorious town gambler (John Carradine) sees her out the window, and offers gallantly to accompany her. Why does he seem so familiar to her? Why does he deny it? Why does he look at her ""that way""? Hmmm. Andy Devine is the pessimistic coach driver, and George Bancroft is the sheriff who has decided to ride shotgun because Geronimo is on the warpath again. Then, just as the stage is leaving the outskirts of town, the town banker jams himself into the coach. The audience has just seen him embezzle funds from the bank, but the passengers know nothing of it. If this weren't enough folks already on this journey, then out on the prairie they spy a lone figure carrying a saddle, the Ringo Kid, played by John Wayne. As he's a jailbreaker bound for Lordsberg to kill the evil men who sent him up river falsely, the sheriff's got his eye on Ringo at all times.
Before this ""routine"" trip is over, there will be babies born, Indian chases, marriage proposals, arrow wounds, stolen horses, and a lot of near-misses for all concerned. Not to mention one big shoot-out at the end! The outcast characters will prove themselves, and some of the high and mighty will tumble awfully low. ""Stagecoach"" is a medieval quest set in the Old West, as everyone is on their own journey, thinking they know what they will find, but getting something very different along the way. It's my personal favorite John Ford western, and only Gary Cooper's ""High Noon"" stands higher in my affections. For an exhilarating ride tonight, hoist yourself into the ""Stagecoach"" and ride off into the sunset with this slice of humanity.",1023148800,,2497,4.809302325581395

I don't know if Ford knew he was making a classic at the time he filmed this, but that's indeed what it is. The stunts alone are well worth watching the picture...including the granddaddy of all Indian-stagecoach ""car chases.""

893443,5,6304457316,"John Ford's 1939 classic ""Stagecoach"" is a landmark film in the history of western movies in so many ways, the most memorable of which is the emergence of John Wayne as a major star.  But more importantly the good guys in the white hats versus the bad guys in the black hats is finally replaced by real human beings who have their strengths and weaknesses.  ""Stagecoach"" is about six passengers, the driver, a sheriff and an outlaw who joins them on their journey.  Wayne plays the Ringo Kid, who has been framed for a murder and is seeking the real killers; Claire Trevor plays Dallas, a prostitute fleeing her unhappy life; Thomas Mitchell is the courageous but alcoholic Dr. Josiah Boone; John Carradine is the gambler, Hatfield; Berton Churchill is Henry Gatewood, a banker who has embezzled a fortune; Donald Meek is Samuel Peacock, a mousy little salesman; Louise Platt is Lucy Mallory, a pregnant woman traveling to join her husband; Andy Devine is the stagecoach driver, Buck and George Bancroft is the tough but fair minded Sheriff Curly Wilcox.
""Stagecoach"" was filmed in what would prove to be Ford's favorite locale, Monument Valley, Utah.  During their journey the personality of each character is revealed as Lucy gives birth, the stagecoach is attacked by Indians, and the Ringo Kid gets revenge on his enemies.  A nice balance between character study and action, ""Stagecoach"" sets standards for how westerns should look and how characters should be real people.  Wayne does not really stand out in this strong ensemble cast, but we can clearly see all the elements of the persona that would make him a screen legend.

893514,4,6304457316,"Stagecoach  The movie Stagecoach was the first of many westerns that John Wayne and John Ford would do together. The movie was received well by the public when released by Warner Bros. in 1939. And Stagecoach was to be the movie that put John Wayne on his way to Western Movie immortality. Stagecoach also proved to be a directorial  masterpiece  orchestrated by the great John Ford , who would later make such great movies as  The Searchers ,  She Wore A Yellow Ribbon, and The Alamo. As awards go, Stagecoach was nominated for several Academy Awards including Best picture, Best Art Direction, Best Director , Best Score, Best Supporting Actor. But Stagecoach  came away with only two Academy Awards. The first was Best Supporting Actor, which was won by Thomas Mitchell for his role as  Doc Boone. The second award, was for Best Score, was won by John M. Leopold, Leo Shuken, and Richard Hageman. Other notable awards were the New York Film Circle Award  for Best Picture, the National Board of Review of Motion Picture Award for 10 Best Films in 1939, and John Ford won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Direction in 1939.  The movie Stagecoach is set in New Mexico during the early 1870's. The movie begins with Doc Boone (Thomas Mitchell) and Dallas (Claire Trevor) being driven out of town due to their sketchy background, mainly alcohol and prostitution, by a local women's group. So both are forced to leave town on the next stagecoach which is being driven by Buck Rickabaugh (Andy Devine). Also along for the ride are Henry Gatewood (Berton Churchill), a crooked banker trying to get out of town; Samuel Peacock (Donald Meek) ,who is a whiskey salesman; Lucy Mallory (Louise Platt), who is going to meet up with her husband who is an cavalry officer in  Lordsburg; Hatfield (John Carradine), who is a local gambler who goes to pursue Lucy Mallory; and Sheriff Curly Wilcox (George Bancroft), who is  going solely due to the fact that that he might have a chance at capturing the Ringo Kid (John Wayne) . As the stagecoach is about to leave, they receive news that Geronimo has left the reservation and is on the warpath with his fellow Apaches. With Cavalry assistance, the stagecoach decides to go ahead as planned. Suddenly a gun shot sounds, and the Ringo Kid is standing in the middle of the trail. He gives himself up without a fight, and is kept on due to the fact that they need some more firepower incase of Apaches. The stagecoach rolls into its first stop and finds out that the Cavalry had already left and that they would have no escort the rest of their journey. After finding out that her husband left and might be seriously injured, Lucy faints and is taken to the bedroom to rest. Only later does Doc realize that she is pregnant and that he must sober up quickly to deliver the baby. After several cups of coffee and splashing himself with cold water, Doc is ready. For hours Doc, with Dallas assisting him, is in the bedroom until Dallas comes out with a baby wrapped in a blanket. After much debate, the group decides to wait an extra day to allow Lucy to rest. With their final destination in sight, the worst possible thing happened, Apaches. A war party of angry Apaches attacks them, but luckily the Cavalry comes to save the day. Once in town, the Ringo Kid Settles an old score with an enemy. The Ringo Kid then marries Dallas and they run off to live on his ranch in Mexico.  The Filming of Stagecoach took place mostly in Monument Valley, Utah. This was the first time John Ford used Monument Valley, and he instantly fell in love with it due to its complete isolation from the rest of the world . He would film several movies in there including The Searchers, another Ford Classic. Filming in Utah made the movie backdrop pretty accurate with what New Mexico would have looked like in the 1870's. As for historical accuracy, it seems to be right on. The Movie mentions Geronimo leaving his reservation , which actually did happen around the 1870's.  Stagecoach seems to come off as a typical western. It has its outlaws, gamblers, drinkers, and Indians. A factor that might turn people off is that the movie is in black and white. And being a person who is growing up in the age of color TV. and movies, it is hard to watch something with band sound and in black and white. But still the movie was rather entertaining and exciting because of John Wayne and the directing of John Ford.

Watch as Wayne enters the Stagecoach and gives his rifle to Curly; already we see the seeds of the great performer. His screen presence really blossoms in his role as the Ringo kid.
Thomas Mitchell's performance as the alcoholic Doc Boone is one of cinema's most outstanding performances. It's a joy to watch him in every scene, especially when he's imbibing. He mixes comedy and drama as well as anyone who ever acted on the silver screen and he owns this role. Andy Devine is also charming, irreverent and marvelous as one of the stagecoach drivers. It's a pity Devine never landed many plumb roles later on his career because he's a gem. Claire Trevor's interplay with Wayne is sweet and memorable. The Duke knew she was a gal with a ""checkered past,"" but didn't care and loved her anyway. Besides ""Key Largo,"" this is Trevor's best screen work. The scene where she walks through the darkened town with the Ringo kid is wistful and poignant, as she has to finally admit to him that she is a ""fallen woman.""
Of course John Ford presides over all of this with a masterful hand. The ubiquitous backdrop of Monument Valley is shown to perfection and his genius as a director is in full bloom here.

Outside of a few minor innovations, Stagecoach was not that good from a production standpoint. It is full of production flaws, visual gimmicks & corny tricks like that glaring dolly (zoom) in on Wayne, many too-long close-ups, mismatched shots, phony outdoor soundstage set-ups & the ridiculous chase scene across the desert near the end. In the high-water-mark year of 1939, full of genuine Hollywood masterpieces like Gone With The Wind, The Wizard Of Oz, Of Mice And Men, et al., Stagecoach was pretty rough around the edges.

The best thing about Stagecoach is the script that elevates it above the typical Western, without which it would have been a run-of-the-mill  Western. The cast is also fine, with the great Thomas Mitchell (Gone With The Wind) stealing the show as the dipsomaniac doc with the heart of gold, Claire Trevor as the fallen angel with the heart of gold & the wonderful John Carradine, who hams it up as the stereotypical gentile ex-confederate Southerner & shady gambler with a heart of fool's gold. The score is essentially overwrought B-Western fare, full of musical clichs. In fact the movie overflows with Hollywood Western clichs, many of which were getting stale even by 1939.

The biggest Western cliche of all was John Wayne, who by '39 had been in more mediocre B-Westers than many horses. Ford made him a star in Stagecoach but couldn't make him a very good actor. He always played precisely the same character, a stiff, invulnerable plywood hero who (almost) never grew in a part or was transformed by experience. Yet he inspired generations of insecure American men & became the model for later actors who echoed his one-demensional caricature of the impervious, monolithic male who (almost) never loses or learns anything, and promoted the idea that any problem could be solved with violence or a gun. The tragic legacy of that mentality we're having to live with today.

Wayne finally played a vulnerable character with depth & humor in True Grit, and even that was mostly self-parody. I always liked Wayne because he was generally likable, but he was also largely a phony who had 7 face lifts & sat out WW2. His low point was Green Berets, which definitely the worst movie he made. With very few exceptions, True Grit was the only really great movie he ever made. The rest were mostly just formula melodramas, like Stagecoach.

Ford went on to direct some great films, but Stagecoach wasn't one of them.",1521331200,,2527,4.851508120649652
