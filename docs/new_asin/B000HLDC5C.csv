8140284,1,B000HLDC5C,"Really couldn't evaluate the movie.  The video was corrupted and unwatchable when I tried to play it on my three computers.  Because this is the second time this has happened with a Halestorm Entertainment dvd (first was Baptists at Our Barbecue), my guess is that they've included some sort of copy protection to keep those dirty video pirates away from their precious copyright.  Instead what they've succeeded in doing is ticking off a legal customer and making sure I will stay away from all Halestorm material in the future.",1252972800,,529,4.921348314606742
8140285,5,B000HLDC5C,"This movie reaches everyone on all levels.  You can see the first 8 minutes at [...]  It immediately draws your attention whether youth or adult.  The main character is an endearing young man who is distracted from going on a mission.  The movie is compassionate and non-judgmental.  It's entertaining as well as touching.  No sermons are preached, just love and support.  By the end of the movie, we all, parents and youth, feel like being better people.",1242086400,,455,4.8311688311688314
