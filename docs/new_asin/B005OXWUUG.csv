4855150,5,B005OXWUUG,"This documentary/drama is very well done. It tells the story of African American troops who served with the 333rd Field Artillery Battalion during the Battle of the Bulge and an atrocity committed by members of the German 1st SS Panzer Division against a group of eleven of those troops. The video contains some very good rare footage and still photos from the U.S. Army Signal Corps and the German Army that are just superb. The dramatic reenactment scenes are well done with a few exceptions. There is also commentary by the executive producer, Joseph Small, who discusses his motivation for making the video. The editing is very well done, expertly weaving the period footage with the dramatic reenactment scenes and the commentary. There are a few minor things that are almost always present in any video based on actual events. The first is that there is snow shown on a number of the dramatic reenactment scenes and during the period covered, December 16-17, there was no snow in the Ardennes, where these events took place. It was cloudy and overcast, but snow did not fall until December 24. The second is the manner in which some of the German troops carry their weapons, an obvious influence of Dale Dye, who doesn't seem to know that troops in World War II didn't carry their rifles (at port arms with the muzzles up) like current day troops carry theirs (with the muzzles down). However, I would not let these relatively minor issues effect an otherwise excellent video. All in all, I highly recommend this video to anyone with an interest in World War II history, especially the contributions of African American troops to the Allied victory.

4855173,3,B005OXWUUG,"Another typical American ""we won the war"" DVD. I was great to see that the people of the area got the war memorial up and running, but why di they have to foot the bill? Surely the American Gov't or War graves commission could have done it.
A great story of a unit who against odds and humility bestowed on then by their own country went to war to help that country. Also great footage and Docudrama.

A few things need to be mentioned though, At about 34/5 minutes into it the Producer explains that he is wearing replica gear that those men would have been wearing and it must have been hard going fro them to get up that hill, Well he is rather larger than those guys and un fit. Combat soldiers would have been a lot fitter. Also he was not in the winter. No comparison.
At 39minutes thirtyish there is footage of Patrol from Knittels 1st SS Recon Battalion this footage is also in other documentaries only it is of Obersturmbannfuhrer Joachim Peiper.

And like most American we won the war movies they go on a about the Malemdy Massacre. Try reading Hans Schmidt SS Panzer grenadier.
Those soldiers that were Massacred were not searched/ pillaged as they were found with their belonging on them. So maybe they tried to escape and someone fired thus starting a panic and everybody started firing. We only ever see/hear what the Americans want us to see and hear. How about reading up on the German side. No one can say for sure 100% that it is how the Americans say we only have their side.
As for the Wereth 11 being Heros, well they fought and died like a lot of other soldiers in that war on both sides, they got caught and killed albeit gruesomely how does that make them heroes? Really????
In the end no body deserves to die like that no matter what army you are in, however we never see documentaries/movies of how the Americans Murdered/massacred some of their charges/prisoners of war do we?
Typical American propaganda.
I only gave it 4 stars as it is a good watch",1388102400,,1977,4.428571428571429

4855175,5,B005OXWUUG,"This film portrays the huge injustice done to a group of true American heroes who were forgotten by their American brothers after the World War II. Despite this terrible oversight, a monument was created by the local citizens and managed for over 40 years with no American support. The truth is finally being told and we owe a huge debt to these long lost heroes.",1376352000,,363,4.6
4855176,5,B005OXWUUG,I was researching African-American soldiers and their participation in the Battle of the Bulge when I ran across this story.

4855177,5,B005OXWUUG,What an amazing movie!  I first heard about The Werth 11 through the European Chapter of The Rocks.  At the time the movie was being made my husband was the Chapter President of the European Chapter of The Rocks.  The dedication and support the he and many of the Rocks members engaged in was amazing.  This is a story that needs to be told in our US History of America.  I want to give a shout out to my hubby Ivan for his hard work and the role he played in the movie...you go COL Ivan Speights!,1359158400,8,497,4.082474226804123

4855179,5,B005OXWUUG,I am an American of Black descent and was a member of C Battery 1st Bn. 333rd Air Defense Artillery. The Unit was re-activated in the 60's as a Hercules Mobile Air Defense Missle Battalion. I was aware of all the citation the unit had received but it was not until I heard about and saw the movie that I learned of the bravery and the contributions of American Blacks in earning those citations and the part played in the battle of the bulge. Being a member of the unit did not and no where else in history did I learn of the great contributions and sacrifices made by those men. Imagine how proud I now feel to have been a member of the same battery and unit that was so much a part of military history. Thank You,1346457600,84,714,4.143884892086331
4855180,5,B005OXWUUG,"""This film is the ""Glory"" and ""Tuskegee Airmen"" of our times which
highlights the amazing sacrifices, tremendous heart and the
outstanding character of The Black Soldier who wasn't welcome to fight
for their own country during times of war.  It's through the
sacrificial efforts, determination and lives of these men, that Colin
Powell became the highest ranking military officer in our nation and
that any and all Black men and women could achieve any rank and
position they dreamed of propelled only by their ambition, not
discriminated due to the color of their skin.""  - TJ  Coleman,
