He was amused.",1514073600,,149,4.137931034482759
8463725,5,B002XUL9AA,"You might think this movie is boring, the director might claim this movie was made to be the most boring movie ever made but i know more then ol steeber. this movie kept me in my chair (fully) for the 90 minutes. It mystified me with the plot. For instance, on the right hand corner are two strokes in the paint, this movie being a create your own adventure book inspiration i named the two billy and bob. They started falling slow into there lives only to find a rut that would stop and dry them out. but billy and bob got into a deep conversation for the rest of the 88 minutes. there were moments i cried and laughed so hard i farted but at the end like any good movie they both get hard. die hard. hard on wood hard.",1437955200,5,720,4.077464788732394

I paused it to get a drink and came back and sat down to start watching again, it was 15 minutes before I remembered I still had it paused.",1437955200,14,239,4.431818181818182
8463727,4,B002XUL9AA,"Initially, I was sceptical about this film. I have heard it's 'dull' and 'boring', but I decided to give it a watch nonetheless..

Once you get past the complexities and the artistic riddles behind this movie.. Wow! What can I say? ...A LOT. It is a purely amazing watch. The start is a pure action filled adrenaline rush that will have you leaning forward in your seats. As you recover for the rest of the movie, you are filled with a sensational story line filled with drama, romance, comedy, you name it.

After being perplexed by this ensemble of pure film magnificence, I decided to watch it again, but with my girlfriend. I've been with her for a very long time, and know her very well. We are very similar and knew she'd appreciate this movie just as I have. After sitting there in pure speechless amazement, she stood up, walked out the door, and never came back. I then got a text saying she was breaking up with me, purely because of this film. I asked why, and she never replied.

Two days later, filled with heartbreak and flooded in tears, I showed one of my good friends this film. Half way through, she paused it, looked me in the eyes and said these exact words: ""This film is perfect. You are perfect."" and kissed me! I have now been with this girl for a couple of months and am already ready to have her move in with me! ALL THANKS TO THIS MOVIE!
I then went on to discover.. this girl, was a guy?! I don't know what to do, I mean, I'm not homophobic, and I have feelings for her(/him?).

Anyway.. 4 stars, 5 stars as a movie, but 4 stars purely for the fact she turned out to be a guy. :/",1351123200,44,1607,4.241830065359477
8463728,1,B002XUL9AA,"This movie is everything it claims to be and more.  Paint is applied.  It dries.  You snooze.  The perfect gift for insomniacs, from the twisted mind of one of America's leading unknown filmmakers.  The added bonus extra film is atmospheric and interesting.",1291593600,2,257,5.023809523809524
