8483665,3,B005QROP4O,"As usual with Sinister Cinema the print quality is just okay. If only the same could be said of the movies. Of the four titles, the only one that's worth watching is RIVER BEAT but it takes a while for that one to get out of low gear. Once it does, however, it's good enough.",1379030400,,275,4.0181818181818185
8483666,4,B005QROP4O,"This is the first volume of Sinister Cinema's Poverty Row series highlighting Screen Guild/Lippert Pictures.  The four movies in this volume are all entertaining B picture product, the best of the group is RIVER BEAT starring beautiful American actress Phyllis Kirk.  RB is a British import released in the U.S. by Lippert in 1954.  Working on an American freighter docked in London, radio operator Kirk unknowingly smuggles diamonds ashore causing difficulties for herself, Scotland Yard and the criminal element.  Another Lippert release is OMOO, OMOO, THE SHARK GOD from 1949.  Based on a novel by Herman Melville, black pearls are stolen from a native shrine bringing a deadly curse to the thief.  Stars are Ron Randell, Devera Burton, Pedro De Cordoba, Michael Whalen and George Meeker.  OOTSG was Lippert Pictures first release after reorganizing and changing the name from Screen Guild Productions.  The other two films were released in 1947 by Screen Guild.  In QUEEN OF THE AMAZONS a group searching for a missing explorer encounter a white jungle queen.  Robert Lowery, Patricia Morrison star.  Last but not least, Rochelle Hudson, Jack LaRue and Austin Willis star in BUSH PILOT.  Brothers are rivals for the affections of a school teacher and air freight territories.  To be sure there is nothing new here, but if you've read this far you may find these classic movies of interest.  My suggestion to Sinister Cinema for volume 2:  ""Rolling Home"", ""The Prairie"", ""The Fighting Men"" and ""Hollywood Thrill-Makers"".",1353110400,,1523,5.184426229508197
