5855590,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"David Kahn has hit another home run with his most recent DVD set ""Mastering Krav Maga (Volume II).  In have both volume 1 and 2 and can't say enough about the techniques and the method in which Mr. Kahn presents the information.  I highly recommend both DVDs and can't wait for a volume III.

5855591,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"If you've ever wanted to learn how to defend yourself, Krav Maga is for you. And if you want to learn Krav Maga from the best, this is the DVD set you will want. Every kick, punch, and defensive move is thoroughly explained and shown in multiple angles in detail. You learn the logic of the moves and the proper execution at the same time, so it all makes clear sense even at first viewing.

Krav Maga may sound exotic, but it is a very down-to-earth system of simple, effective defensive moves combined with a simultaneous, overwhelming counter attack. All the moves are natural- simple blocks, kicks and punches. But the genius lies in the application, and these DVDs (and Volume 1) illustrate that application clearly. This is a totally accessible system, and is immediately empowering.",1375228800,2,789,4.801470588235294
5855592,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"David Kahn has forgotten more about Krav Maga than most ""instructors"" currently know/teach. He is the best in the business, and happens to also be one of the nicest guys in the world.  I have the privilege to know David on a personal, and professional level, and continue to learn from him. If you have any interest in Krav Maga, and you don't own any of David's books, or DVDs, you need to add them to your collection.  These weapon defense DVDs are amazing. If you ever wanted to know how to defend against various weapons then purchase these DVDs, you won't be disappointed.",1375142400,2,577,4.538461538461538
5855593,5,B00DTWI6ZC,So I just ordered in both of the new self defense against weapons by David Kahn and I can't wait to start them. Soon as they are in I will update everyone with a better layout in review but if its typical David Kahn you can assume in advance that it will be really good.,1375056000,2,270,3.9272727272727272

5855605,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"David offers Clear, step by step instructions with a great overview of the techniques combined with a detailed walk through of all the moves! He has a great method of teaching, by showing you what to do, what not to do, and the reasons why...he simplifies the techniques in such a way that you can learn Krav Maga instantly by understanding how and why it works...after reviewing many methods of combatives and personal protection, Mastering Krav Maga by David Kahn is the absolute best on the market...order it, watch it, review it, practice it...Amazing set of instructional DVDs on the best combatives system on the market by the best instructor on the market!",1424131200,,663,4.876106194690266

5855607,4,B00DTWI6ZC,"David Kahn has presented a solid and constructive view of real Krav Maga which is refreshing a gladly appreciated. This is real deal defensive tactics. While this isn't a ""blue print"" to black belt, Krav Maga isn't really supposed to be such a thing in the first place. Persons wishing to buy a belt in a box type training program will be disappointed.

Mr. Kahn has taken the time to line out the main system concepts as well as display the proper way they should be utilized. Combative instruction should be simple, easy to learn, and effective. David has presented this material in a way that does exactly that.

I have been training in martial arts for 34 years, I am a military and law enforcement veteran (certified LE Instructor), and I currently own/operate a martial arts/defensive tactics training facility. My personal opinion is that this is one of the best DT DVD sets available to the general public and at a very fair price. Don't hesitate to buy this...these DVD's are a great product.",1420934400,5,1001,4.714285714285714
5855608,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"David Khan is one of the worlds best in authentic Krav Maga.
There are so many groups out there now that supposedly teach Krav Maga but are fake or just train like cardio kickboxing.
These DVDs are amazing, often brutal but extremely effective techniques.

I would highly recommend investing the money for the 3 sets currently available from Mr Khan, I have all 3 and the books to accompany them and it is a fabulous investment in personal safety.
I have been involved and teaching martial arts for 26 years now and am disappointed in how politics and sport has taken over the martial aspect of the arts.

5855610,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"This is another outstanding production by David Kahn. Great quality presentation, recording, sound, and instructional performance. The DVD series complements very well with the book and other additional training in Krav Maga you do. I'm very excited to have purchased these DVDs. At this point I have obtained all of his books and all DVD series available from Amazon. In my opinion, these materials are one of if not the most complete and comprehensive available, if you really want to study, analyse and practice what you learn in theory. There is lots of material. You can use the books to read some of the concepts and principles as you combine it with the DVDs which on it's own, provides not only the techniques but written theory. Highly recommend this if you are serious about studying KM.",1415145600,,797,4.867647058823529

5855612,5,B00DTWI6ZC,Dave is the best.,1412294400,,17,3.5
5855613,2,B00DTWI6ZC,"The information in the DVDs is all there, though it would be nice if each motion was broken down more thoroughly as it is in some of the books I have read on the subject. However my biggest pet peeve is with the main instructor, a high degree black belt whom seems to use his sparring partners as human examples. KRAV MAGA IS A POTENTIALLY LETHAL MARTIAL ART, and this poorly constructed DVD seems to have no coordination between the instructor and those he is using to demonstrate his actions. They appear confused and scared and are often the subject of unexpected barrages of punches POST sequence. ""AND COUNTERATTACK AND COUNTERATTACK""",1408406400,2,639,4.7657657657657655
5855614,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"The best of the best.  If you want to learn real krav maga from one of the best instructors out there, this is it.  Not only is David Kahn an amazing Kravist, he's an exceptional instructor as well. It's a shame that this level of training is offered in very, very few places in the USA and this is the second best option other than live training.  I have been training with KMWW for several years now and it's great.  But David Kahn and the IKMA are in a league of there own.  Buy ALL THREE of his DVD SETS.you will not regret it.",1407196800,,531,4.0673076923076925
5855615,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"If you are hesitating buying this DVD set because of the price (like I was) - then don't be concerned. It is well worth the money! D. Kahn clearly understands the needs of us interested in self-defense/combatives.

What makes this DVD so valuable is the depth and breadth of techniques. Defenses from a vast array of positions/situations using knives, machetes and syringes. He demonstrates a variety of hand and leg defenses from standing and ground positions.

Everything is clearly explained and multiple angles shown. A comprehensive DVD set that prepares you for just about any situation you might encounter. Outstanding DVD set.",1405900800,2,634,5.205882352941177
5855616,5,B00DTWI6ZC,Excellent videos!,1404604800,,17,8.0
5855617,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"The first thing I want to mention is the practicality of the content may slip by you on the first viewing. The lessons are filmed great, but it's the narration and explanation of the lessons in the break downs that hold the details to effectively perform the defenses. This series closely follows Mastering Krav Maga volume I with body mechanics and basic positioning and continues with refinements and awareness training for blunt and edged weapon hazards. There can be major differences between armed attack defenses by the angle the weapon is brought into play and these are all covered in this volume, which I haven't seen anywhere else in such detail. Lessons on preemption, bailouts, control holds, combinations, and most notably ground survival (which is missing in other series I own) are all here. The most compelling part is that the series addresses possible attacks I hadn't been aware of before, such as the section on feints and complex attacks. It's all here.",1403654400,,974,4.9815950920245395
5855618,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"These are the best self-defense DVDs I've ever owned!  They are an integral of our family training program.  I hold black belts in Kenpo and Tae Kwon Do and the Krav Maga style presented in this system is easy to learn, easy to remember, and the techniques are mechanically more efficient/effective than many other martial arts.  David Khan has done an outstanding job, both in content and presentation.  The DVDs are easy to follow and provide views from all angles, so you can easily learn the techniques.  Again, buy these DVDs--You won't be disappointed!",1403395200,,558,4.8936170212765955

5855621,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"""Absolutely, the best Krav Maga video in the market today. David Kahn has done it again. He's providing material that can potentially save my life or the life of my loved ones in the future. Hopefully, one day there will be an IKMA certified instructor on Guam (USA) to help refine my knowledge. This is a must have DVD! Goes great with the books!""",1398211200,2,348,4.453125
5855622,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"David Kahn is an expert martial artist.  His interaction with his students and associates on these DVDs shows total class.  Mr. Kahn puts forth astounding technical ability, devastating technique and a human and brilliant teaching style.  The DVDs are very well produced, the demonstrations are easy to understand and the material itself is simply outstanding practical self defense.  Amazon did a perfect job of delivering all the material as promised.  Thank you.",1396742400,,465,5.402777777777778
5855623,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"I highly recommend this set to anyone wanting to learn Krav Maga, The videos are very well done easy to follow and very informative.  David Kahn is one of a handfull of people in the US that has trained and has been accredited by the founding Krav Maga organization in Islreal,  his achievements and knowledge are to great to list in this review. David  is a great person and has personally answered e-mails I have sent him regarding questions concerning Krav Maga",1396569600,,464,4.634146341463414
5855624,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"I own this DVD set as well as Volume I DVD set, plus two of Mr. Kahn's books in Kindle version; Krav Maga: An Essential guide and Advanced Krav Maga: The Next Level. I'm not presently involved in a Krav Maga school at the moment so for me this is the next best thing. Mr. Kahn is a very skilled and talented instructor. I really wish he had a school here in the North Orange County area of California!  His books and DVD's are very informative, comprehensive and practical and I would highly recommend them to any aspiring kravist. Mr. Kahn has also been very gracious in taking the time to answer my many questions regarding technique via email, as well as by phone. He also gave me a personal invite to train with him any time I'm in the area , which I think is pretty cool. Thanks for putting out such a great product Mr. Kahn.",1389657600,,830,4.253164556962025
5855625,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"As a companion piece to David Kahn's third book, WEAPONS DEFENSE, he has produced a set of DVD's showing these techniques in action.  A review of these videos reveals David's moves to be precise and practical.  They can be learned with proper training under an Israeli Krav Maga instructor.
Building on the teachings of Imi, founder of Krav Maga, and Grand Master Heim Gidon, David Kahn has become a leading proponent and practitioner of this system.

Imi continues to smile; Alan and Rick are also proud

5855626,5,B00DTWI6ZC,Great explanations on the defenses.  Shows multiple angles and repeats the steps.  I'll be buying Vol III when finished with this one.  Thank you Mr. Kahn!,1387411200,,155,4.884615384615385
5855627,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"I bought this dvd Vol. II ( and Vol. I) for my daughter, 9 yrs. old. who's training Krav Maga. It really helps her a lot ! A must have for those Krav Maga trainees. Thanks to David Kahn!",1387411200,,186,3.7948717948717947
5855628,5,B00DTWI6ZC,The DVD set is very straight forward with good clear explanations of each move and excellent demonstrations done from many different angles.  one of the things that makes David Khan's videos stand out is the explanations of the common mistakes  that are made when performing these techniques.  A true benefit is the continual reinforcement of the openness of Krav Maga to your use of many different combinations for follow up techniques.  This is a must have set for Krav Maga practitioners.,1386892800,,491,5.0246913580246915
5855629,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"David is a great intstructor of his art. Basic core instinctual movements , the moves he teaches happen without much thought once you are aware of the principles. Great set , I will of coarse buy the next release on gun defenses when they are available. Keep them coming David and thank you ... Steele",1384819200,,301,4.490909090909091
5855630,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"The latest in David Kahn's Krav Maga instruction series does not disappoint.  I own each of his 3 books as well as the original DVD set.  I have also had the pleasure of training with David at his studio in New Jersey on more than one occasion, the most recent time being for a seminar on the material covered in this latest DVD set.

David is a fantastic instructor in any setting.  His self paced materials (books and DVD's) are as accurate a representation of his in person instruction as one could ask, expect, and require. His approach as an instructor, and the Krav Maga system he teaches (IKMA) are exactly as advertised - practical, applied, and in direct context to real world self defense situations.

Anyone looking for solid techniques for weapons defenses would do well to purchase this DVD set.

Also, if you happen to be in MA area, please reach out to me (you can find me on LinkedIn).  I am always looking to meet and connect with good training partners.",1384387200,,971,4.545977011494253
5855631,5,B00DTWI6ZC,This DVD set is comprehensive and concise.  David explains and demonstrates each technique masterfully.  The video and sound quality are vastly superior to many products on the market today.  Im not much on belaboring a point but if your serious this is for you.,1384300800,,262,4.909090909090909
5855632,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"David Kahn  has did it again with volume 2 . His teaching styleis as good as the Krav Maga self defence system which is beyond words, just fascinating. As a martial artist and student of the art in the 1980s' I'm not a novice. There is a lot of krav maga out there and its not Israeli Krav Maga, their just using the name. Its just m.m.a.  Not much of a foundation. In most things such as building a house you must have a good foundation or it want stand very long. Imi laid a good strong foundation, Grand Master Gidon has built on this foundation and they have developed a top ranked self defense system. If anyone can teach this system as good as David I would like to see it. But i'll stick with David and the Gidon system. I know there is some really good krav out there but some of it will get you killed and quick. They got a lot of flash and catchy language , that's the sell.  The whole family are turning into kravist around here. Kahn and company are part of the family now.  You want be disapointed with these dvds. On a closing note in Ezekiel 37:10 , that exceddingly great army of Israel are , probably trained in Krav Maga.",1382227200,,1139,4.163636363636364
5855633,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"Once again, David provides an invaluable resource for those interested in learning Israeli Krav Maga.  There is no substitute for attending the classes by those qualified to teach Israeli Krav Maga, but these DVDs are the next best thing.

On the subject of impact and edge weapon defenses, David brings to the viewers attention many relevant points that need to be considered, as well as the defenses that have been tried, tested and known to work.

His DVDs are a great resource to me as an Israeli Krav Maga practitioner living outside the countries with an established school.

Nice work David and the team there!",1381795200,,617,4.847619047619047
5855634,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"This is not the first Krav Maga DVD or book that I have utilized.  But as with Mr. Kahn's other DVD set, this production is undoubtedly one of the best.  Not only are the techniques well explained and demonstrated, they are done so at a speed that is easy to watch and understand.

The techniques are all very practical and valuable.  I have yet to find a skill that Mr. Kahn is teaching that I don't find useful.  Whether you are a beginner or seasoned Martial Artist or self defense enthusiast -- this is probably one of the most valuable training tools you will find on the market today.

Combined with the Mastering Krav Maga DVD set, these DVDs make the most comprehensive empty hand, weapons and ground defense compilation available.

Without a doubt, I would recommend this DVD set to those ranging from just wanting to learn self defense to those instructors wanting real life self defense skills to add to their current Martial Arts or Self Defense curriculum.

The only thing that can top the use of these DVD is training with Mr. Kahn himself.  He is one of the most talented instructors I have had the honour of working with.  As well, as being very skilled Mr. Kahn has the ability to teach in a manner that is very easy to understand and a pleasure to learn from.

Very professional and valuable production.",1380499200,3,1321,4.555084745762712
5855635,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"I did not write a review for the Mastering Krav Maga Volume 1 addition of David Kahn's DVD series but if I did it would be the same top notch review as this. I own both and highly recommend both they build on each other as I am sure they are intended to do. I have presently been training for about six months and the Mastering Krav Maga DVD series enhances my class training. The series allows me to refer to things we did in class and discover some more history of Krav Maga. Mastering Krav Maga Volume 1 and 2 accelerates my learning experience, providing more background and different applications of my class material. The different camera angles of each technique are important to get an overall picture of how they are done. I find the slow and realtime examples of the moves also a necessary part of learning each technique.
I am thrilled to have discovered Krav Maga and the Mastering Krav Maga series which will expand anyone's knowledge of Krav Maga.",1379894400,3,961,4.528735632183908

5855637,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"The DVD set is packed with tons of practical techniques. Each technique is presented professionally and with emphasis on details. The DVD contains excellent explanations and demonstrations of very hard to find defenses against non common knife and machete attacks, slashes and from various angles and situations.

I would like to thank David Kahn for excellent DVD and I am looking forward for the Volume III.",1378080000,4,409,5.196969696969697
5855638,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"On watching the DVDs, you will quickly come to see that Mr. Kahn and his instructors know what they are talking about.
Not only are the individual steps of the counter-attacks shown in detail, but they are shown repeatedly and from multiple camera angles.  The techniques are easy to understand, and very intuitive.  Just as important are demonstrations of what not to do in a dangerous encounter.  The errors many people make when defending against an attacker are shown in detail, and the reasons for avoiding those actions are explained and demonstrated.

These DVDs also cover aspects of a self-defense that many would not immediately think to take into consideration, such as reminders on the legal aspects of use-of-force. During a heated exchange when tempers have flared or fear is a driving force, it can be easy to allow oneself to go overboard with the application of force once you've gotten the upper hand.  I found the inclusion of this information to be very inspired.

This video series is great for both a beginner, and someone who has had instruction in other fighting styles.  It is with enthusiasm that I give this video series all the credit it deserves.",1377820800,2,1175,4.874371859296482
5855639,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"This DVD set covers defense against weapons in great detail.  Just like the previous set, these are professionally produced.  David carefully explains the right way to perform the techniques, mistakes to avoid and the theory behind it.  Sometimes other video clips (such as military demonstrations) are interspersed with the main instruction to drive home a point.

He created the DVD in such a well professional and easy to follow up.....
I am able to keep up with my level by watching each dvd individually and at my own pace....to stop...doing the technique on my own..then watch again! I have shown and introduced each lesson to my students every time we practiced a move shown by David in DVD.
They are able to see the effectiveness with police and military too.
I totally recommend everyone doing Martial Art, self defense, police and military especially to get this as their main tool to improve their skills.
Thank you so much for Volume II....Volume I was already a success but this one EVEN more tactical!!",1377043200,2,769,4.579710144927536
5855642,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"I simply cannot speak highly enough about Mr. Kahn's work. I own all of the materials he has put out there and it is for good reason. David Kahn has a real gift for teaching, his quiet, unassuming and humble demeanor make it easy to learn. His techniques are the most recent practices of Grandmaster Haim Gidon, director of krav maga instruction to all branches of the Israeli military, special forces and is a highly sought after instructor throughout the world. A must have to anyone serious about self defense.",1376956800,2,513,4.711111111111111
5855643,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"Have just finished reviewing the complete series of techniques covered in this DVD set and, as expected, David demonstrates not just excellent self defense techniques, but a great capacity to break it down and make these techniques achievable through a DVD.
At the end of the day, we all look to these types of products as instructional tools to be reviewed often as ways of adding to and/or perfecting existing abilities. David takes the time to showcase the techniques at multiple speeds and in multiple angles so that we can, as students, appreciate the nuances of motion.
I have been a martial arts instructor for over 10 years, so I can quickly point out when a person is just a good practitioner vs. a good instructor.
The good news here is David Kahn is both. He puts out solid products that I can and will use to improve my method of teaching Krav Maga.",1375920000,2,861,4.597402597402597
8597702,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"Bottom line up front.  David Kahn and his team are, by far, the best there is, and teach the best version of the best system there is.  If you want to arm yourself with the best tools to survive any encounter (Civilian, Law Enforcement (LE), or Military Combat) David Kahn, and the IKMA (GS), are your best option.

Historically, development of Self-defense systems and martial arts occurred from the necessities of the existing time-period and social norms concerning violence.  For example, Karate for the Samurai or Kali for villagers of the Philippines (whose conflicts were tribal and weapons of choice where whatever they had laying around).  Societies developed these systems and martial arts in order to, quickly and efficiently, train Soldiers. This was so they would possess the capabilities to close with and destroy their adversaries in hand-to-hand combat if and when necessary.  Imi Lichtenfeld designed Israeli Krav Maga in the 1940s in order to address the modern combatant.  Whether dealing with a mugger on the streets, or a foreign adversary on the battlefield. No other system is as modern or effective as Krav Maga.

The IKMA (GS) is the only true Krav Maga system under Grand Master Haim Gidon (successor to Imi Lichtenfeld).  It is, by far, any agencies best option for training its Soldiers and/or LE officers.  A single ten-hour seminar with David Kahn, and his team, proved to be worth a year of training in any other dojo I have attended.  I have trained on several forms of martial arts and self-defense systems.  I always shop around for the best instructor with the most practical training.  David and his team are undeniably the best there is.  I have driven fourteen hours at a time, on several occasions, to attend training with him.  I always leave the seminars absolutely motivated to come back to base and share what I learned with my Soldiers.

Krav Maga has grown in popularity in the west in recent decades.  There are several different interpretations of the system available in the US (e.g. Warrior Krav Maga /Krav Maga World Wide).  Most of them teach substandard techniques, with the addition of cardiovascular endurance training, in order to appeal to those more susceptible to advertising and marketing.  The idea being, Get fit and learn to defend yourself overnight.  While Krav Maga is designed to be simple to understand.  There still needs to be much emphasis on the subtle fine points that make any technique effective.  Far removed from the source, these schools often sacrifice proper technique for mass production.  This can have fatal consequences when someone uses those techniques for actual self-defense.  I have also frequented several introductory courses where the facility told me they strictly focus on civilian self-defense.  There are three tiers to Krav Maga (Military, Civilian, and Law Enforcement).  Any master of the system should know and be able to instruct them all.  As a Law Enforcement Officer, I also have a firm understanding of the Use of Force (UOF) continuum.  I also understand the legal ramifications for not understanding the UOF continuum.  David Kahn and the IKMA (GS) are true masters of the system. They will ensure that the student gets every detail and piece of knowledge they require for the techniques they are taught to be effective.

Israeli Krav Maga under the IKMA (GS) is also a great plug and play system. If your agency has an existing system where you believe there are gaps in its current techniques, or dilemmas which your system does not address, Krav Maga will fill those gaps easily.  I have personally found this to be applicable for LE systems, military combatives, and other martial arts/self-defense systems alike.

Additionally, if you attend the seminars to get hands on training, and a professional instructors critique on your form (which I highly recommend), the DVDs and books hold nothing back in terms of helping you to refresh your memory.  The five books (approximately 1000 pages worth of instructional material) are extremely well articulated and literally spell out every detail you need to know from a strategic approach.  They articulate all the subtle nuances, which make a technique work.  The four DVD volumes (approximately 27 hours of instructional material) do an excellent job of using a by the numbers approach to teaching and demonstrating the technique, as well as elaborating on key points.  For those who have served in an instructor position, in either the military or law enforcement, the previously mentioned materials more than portray a Training Support Package (TSP) or Program of Instruction (POI).  In addition, the materials previously mentioned will entirely refresh your techniques acquired by any seminar attended in person with David.

Once again, bottom line up front.  David Kahn and the IKMA (GS) are by far the best there is, teaching the best version of the best system there is.  If you want to arm yourself with the best tools to survive any encounter (Civilian, Law Enforcement, or Military Combat) David Kahn, and the IKMA (GS), are your best option.",1526169600,5,5108,5.056152927120669
8597703,5,B00DTWI6ZC,I'm a prior Infantryman and am a current Security Forces officer. We take our combative training very serious. I have been doing martial arts for over 20 years. These DVD's are excellent learning tools. Great instruction and very easy to follow along. This is real Krav Maga and not some fitness regime. If you are just starting out learning self defense or are looking to add some serious firepower to your current arsenal then this a must have. These are very simple and realistic techniques that anyone can do.,1516665600,,513,4.775280898876405
8597704,5,B00DTWI6ZC,This is simply an awesome DVD set. David Kahn explains every self defense technique in great detail and shows how to do them in different angles. He gives plenty of examples of what is the correct and incorrect way to do them. He also shows you examples of how to use similar basic technique for multiple situations. Definitely recommend this DVD set.,1497225600,2,351,4.67741935483871
8597705,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"I started my martial arts journey at age 19 in 1969. I am a 4th degree black belt in Shorin Ryu Karate. Over the years I trained in other martial arts including boxing, Thai Boxing, Judo, and grappling. After 15 active years in the dojo my son was born and other family priorities took precedence over my training, although I continued to work out on the bag. At age 66, after two hip surgeries I was looking to hone my martial art skills once again. I own both volume 1 and 2 of the Krav Maga dvd's. Mr. Kahn is an excellent instructor. Many of the techniques are familiar to me, others are new, but the instruction has re-vitalized my mind, body, and spirit. I highly recommend the Krav Maga dvd's for beginners or old hands like me.",1493769600,4,735,4.333333333333333

8597707,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"As a martial artist, self-defense instructor, personal trainer, and a Naturopathic practitioner, I agree with David Kahn's philosophy on how Krav Maga should be instructed to those wanting to learn the purest form of Krav Maga, especially during these days of many instructors combining other arts/disciplines with Krav Maga just for the sake of giving it another name so they can claim it as their own.  In his DVD, Mastering Krav Maga, and in his books, Krav Maga Defense and Krav Maga Professional Tactics, David keeps it REAL, PURE, and EFFECTIVE!  I highly recommend all of David's books and videos for the martial arts enthusiast, law enforcement personnel, and military personnel.",1484784000,3,687,5.18018018018018
8597708,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"This dvd set is the most comprehensive instructional you can buy on krav maga. The material presented an the way it is presented makes it very easy to understand and learn.

The material presented on these dvds will bring you up to speed very quickly on real krav maga. you will be instructed on the basics and core foundation of krav maga,like the blocking frames and retzev. ""not all krav maga is the same"" is very true. David Kahn of the IKMA exemplifies this in this dvd set. this is real krav maga.
I recently had the privilege to train with David Kahn at fort campbell ky. where the militaru and special forces asked him to come for instruction. this in of itself speaks volumes. the tech. i learned form him in anti-terrorism and gun/knife disarms and some of the best i have seen. most you see just won't work. he teaches the real deal.  for your money this is the best krav maga on the market.",1477612800,,939,4.396551724137931

8597711,5,B00DTWI6ZC,"I have Purchased Vol. 1 as well, this Vol. 2 is also excellent. I have been taking Wing Chun classes for several years and there is good overlap, but also new things and ways to combine things. This year I also joined a Krav Maga IKI school so I could learn weapon attacks and defenses.

This set has great instructions.  I am in Disc 4. Disc 2 has great reviews of unarmed strikes and principles. You see the importance of getting off the attack line, while blocking/redirecting and simultaneously striking , just like in Wing Chun. We didn't do much weapons work there so am glad to be learning these techniques.

The summary tips/on screen writing is on screen long enough to read now, unlike with Vol. 1

Overall I love it, and ordered Volume 3 to learn more firearms defenses.",1474416000,4,781,4.5177304964539005
