We must kill them. We must incinerate them. Watered-down PPV after Watered-down PPV. Point fighter after Point fighter. Incompetent judge after Incompetent judge.  Chael Sonnen after Chael Sonnen.

And they call me a Troll. What do you call it when the Trolls accuse the Troll?

They lie. They lie, and we have to be merciful, for those who lie. Those Zuffa shills. I hate them. I do hate them.

The horror.

...the horror.",1333756800,5,610,4.8173076923076925
5078897,1,B007CZ328I,"The Judges Decision in the main event is one of the Worst I've ever seen. It's tough to give a Nick Diaz Event 1 star but the decision is worth it. They gave the win to a guy who ran away and landed leg kicks for 5 rds. I honestly can't even give a legit analysis of the other fights on the card because this decision was so bad I tried to forget I even wasted money buying it.
This sport is slowly starting to die (look at the UFC's ratings & PPV #'s) with the new way it's dictated by rankings, the way it's judged & reported, and the overall direction of the sport. It's a shame. Used to be a great sport to watch. Maybe a new promoter with a new vision will come along and pump some juice into it.
The UFC was credited with saving sport but honestly the sport was NEVER gonna be main stream. The UFC & it's Zuffa parent company is now starting to kill the sport of MMA.",1333670400,4,873,3.965909090909091

8514784,1,B007CZ328I,"People here applauding Condit's ""Gameplan"" as if they get it and the people who hated the fight and KNOW he was given a gift decision don't and their opinions are irrelevant make me sick.
Bottom line Condit did NOT want to engage Diaz who had far superior hands & Boxing skills so he ran around for 5 rds. countered with leg kicks and point fighting tactics to ""win"" a decision. The decision was robbery as are many MMA Fights.
Diaz deserved better as do Fight fans who get cheated out of their hard earned money by fighters like Condit who only care about playing it safe and not realizing it's a fans sport so go out and put on a show and go out and bang.
Diaz gets it, Lawler gets it, Manhoef, Cung Le, Scott Smith, Phil Baroni, Ray Sefo etc. they get it.
Even Frank Shamrock who was a submission ace when he started fell in love with his striking and went for it because he knew that's what fans wanted and deserved.  Not 3 rounds of the running man or dry humping your opponent for 15 minutes...lol.",1375660800,2,1004,4.28421052631579
8514785,5,B007CZ328I,"Hardcore Diaz fans will always badmouth this event and permanently place Condit, a man with almost all finishes on his record, in the point fighter category. I honestly feel bad for anyone who can't look at this fight impartially and see it for the great fight that it was. Diaz is an extremely dangerous fighter and Condit came into this fight with a brilliant gameplan to shut him down and force him to fight his fight.

Great style matchup with a clear victor.",1356220800,,463,4.578313253012048
8514786,1,B007CZ328I,"Nick Diaz got totally screwed with this fight.  Carla Condit kept running away from Nick like a little bitch.  He was terrified of Nick Diaz, it was so obvious.  Condit's plan was to point fight and run.  Condit threw some lame a$$ kicks and won the fight.  Nick Diaz pushed the fight from beginning to end, but Carla Condit kept running away.  If you know anything about MMA, Nick Diaz is the man to watch.  He brings it every time!!  He goes toe to toe every fight!!  Don't waste your money on this UFC.  Condit's a joke!!  He should be banned from MMA, he's a disgrace to the MMA world.",1353369600,,589,4.263636363636364
8514787,3,B007CZ328I,I thought the Diaz vs Condit fight was a draw in my opinon. Everybody should buy and watch this fight for themselves to get their own opinon. I think both fighters should've pushed the action a little more and go for the finish. The Nelson vs Werdum fight was a letdown. The Koscheck vs Pierce fight was close and the best match on the entire card.,1341014400,,348,4.287878787878788
8514788,5,B007CZ328I,"I don't know what people are talking about, how Diaz should have won the belt. That's a load of crap, Condit didn't play Diaz's game. I had it scored for rounds one, and two 10-9 Diaz, and the last three rounds for Condit with a 10-9. It was a great fight, I ended up with a poster from the fight. So this is a must see fight of the year.",1336608000,4,338,3.842857142857143
8514789,2,B007CZ328I,"Typical Greg Jackson special. Supposedly we were told this would be a ""war"",but instead we got a remake of Forrest Gump running. The lead actor was Carlos Condit. What happened to the Natural born killer? Maybe that's why he so easily agreed to a rematch? On top of that what was the Judges watching? What a letdown!",1336262400,6,316,4.56140350877193
8514790,3,B007CZ328I,"While it wasn't a great event, it was still an event worth watching. Don't listen to all the reviews that just talk about the main event, there were still some good moments (Roy Nelson vs Fabricio Werdum, Dustin Poirier's mounted triangle submission, Stephen Thompson's head kick knockout, Josh Koscheck and Mike Pierce in a close battle). It's an event worth watching.",1335225600,4,369,5.065573770491803
8514791,5,B007CZ328I,Carlos Condit gave Nick Diaz a LESSON on how to stick and move! :) Carlos picked him apart! Lol. :) A Beautiful display all while making Nick Diaz look like the PUNK he is. :),1334707200,6,175,4.0285714285714285
8514792,1,B007CZ328I,"Both of these guys are known for ""bringing it"", however Jackson coached condit avoided engaging the entire fight, choosing merely to survive.
And Diaz was unable to get his game going or change it to compensate for Condits abysmal showing.
Sadly Condit kinda won 3 rounds to 2, and I was rooting for Nick.
You may or may not dispute that decision, but you can't dispute that the fight itself was 5 rounds of suck.
A fight you will never want to watch again.
A fight that made Diaz never want to fight again.
I have no recollection of any of the other fights on the card.
Don't buy this dvd.
And don't buy the one where Overoid fights Lesnar either, you know why.",1334188800,6,662,4.346774193548387
