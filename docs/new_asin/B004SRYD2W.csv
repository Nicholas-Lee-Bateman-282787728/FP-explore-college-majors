8440195,1,B004SRYD2W,"I'm a big fan of Christopher Dunn. His work is excellent and I have read most if not all of his books. He is a very compelling author, but alas, not as good a speaker. But the other problem with this DVD is the amateur-ish quality of the video. Its just a camera trained mostly on Dunn, sometimes panned over to the projection screen, interspersed with precious few videos. I always enjoy hearing Dunn cite example after example of proof of ancient machining, but the magic just does not come through on this one. Finally, I could forgive all of that if the price of the DVD was a bit more reasonable. At $19.95 its about $10 overpriced. Save your money. I'm going to see what Amazon's refund policy is.",1309046400,8,703,4.415384615384616
