7786653,5,B01HH4THYG,"If you're a fan of D&D (or any of the other fantasy RPGs for that matter) you'll enjoy this documentary. To put it simply, Stefan is us. Or at least the us that we wish we could be - he took a passion for D&D and turned it in to a living. And if is his portrayal is accurate, he still has the same enthusiasm for D&D today as any of us had when we were young and just discovering it. It's well worth checking out.",1470614400,2,413,3.813953488372093

7786655,5,B01HH4THYG,"I picked this gem up on Blu-ray at Gen Con. It is a glimpse into the fantastic journey that brought about one of the Dwarven Forge kickstarters and a surprisingly intimate look into the past of Stefan Pokorny, the creative force and owner of the company. It took turns being goofy, revealing, bizarre, and quixotic; but it was entertaining throughout! Even my wife, who has nothing to do with the hobby thus far, enjoyed it.

Stefan narrates his journey himself as he goes through various tasks and life events. It is fantastic to watch him pull up to a small and unassuming house and treat it with the reverence normally reserved for the destination at the end of a religious pilgrimage. The sheer awe and reverence he gives to the former home of Gary Gygax, creator of D&D, is rivaled only by his love of the game. Check this out!",1471478400,,832,4.546666666666667

7786658,5,B01HH4THYG,"Polymaths are rare and special people; Stefan is one. This is a fascinating, and personal, tale of one man's search to find his muse, and her name was ART.
Stefan is one of the leading, and certainly most visible, proponents of fantasy role-playing and shares his passion with the world. The fact that he has been able to build a successful business doing something he so truly loves is enviable.",1470700800,,396,4.671428571428572
7786659,5,B01HH4THYG,"In this new era of Dungeons & Dragons resurgence in homes all across America, this is an especially rare and touching glimpse of the creativity, imagination, and passion that kept it's flame lit for all those years before. This quirky mini-biography showcases the quintessential Dungeon Master Stefan, and is surprisingly human. What could have just been a forgettable film about the business behind tabletop gaming, instead gives us an intimate window into the life of a rare and extraordinarily generous artist, who has stubbornly refused to let go of his childhood D&D hobby, but instead carry it forward, and bring it to the next generation of gamers.",1470614400,,655,5.130841121495327

8765432,5,B01HH4THYG,"This film is an inspiration. There's nothing more amazing than a man following his love for art and D&D and turning it into a career. He inspired me to write an adventure for publication and start casting terrain of my own. Stefan Pokorny is also a great guy, not just in the film, but in real life. He added me on Facebook and actually responds to messages and comments.",1522108800,,371,4.391304347826087
