8409422,5,B003YJBCJW,"Beautifully filmed version of the live show, ""Pra Se Ter Alegria - Ao Vivo No Rio"".  The platinum selling DVD covers many of the songs from the two previous Roberta Sa albums.  I found the concert DVD to be a joyful, engaging and thoroughly entertaining evening.  The catchy tunes also would make one want to watch this concert over and over again.  I'm not the only one.  The concert's audience, by their singing along, caused the concert to have to be filmed twice.  Ms. Sa must truly love her fans to put up with that!  Guest participation in the concert include the incredible mandolin playing of Hamilton de Holanda.  Rapper Marcelo D2 brings alot of fun to the song, ""Samba do Balanco"".  Pedro Luis (Pedro Luis ea Parede, Monobloco and husband of Roberta Sa) participates on one of his compositions, ""Girando na Renda"".  Extras on the DVD include the lushly filmed music video of the Latin Grammy nominated single, ""Belo Estranho Dia de Amanha"".  Other extras include duets with masters of song and instrument such as Chico Barque, Ney Matogrosso, Yamandu Costa, Trio Madeira Brasil and a host of other accomplished musicians.  For sure, it's another one for the collection.",1326067200,,1180,4.845
