5319254,5,B009DA74DY,"One hour format started with this series...still B&W, but with an hour long series I think the writing had to become more tighter.  I'm not too sure if it was this season or before when I noticed a woman writer for the show.  Seems like women are portrayed as thieves, saloon gals, husband hunters, etc. In other words very colorful, but mostly desperate women trying to scratch out a decent living for themselves.  Otherwise the DVD set was fine and transfer is just as smooth and well done as previous CBS affiliated DVD sets.",1480809600,,528,4.595744680851064

5319260,5,B009DA74DY,"Gunsmoke provides western-lovers with a family-friendly great show that emphasizes character, law & order, and good plain common sense. This half-season, as well as all previous episodes, provide a breath of fresh air in an age when many of the most entertaining movies have drifted from such character-building values. It is amazing to me that the writers were successful in making the plot and storyline consistently excellent and among the best of the classic Westerns from season to season for so many consecutive seasons. I cannot think of one episode to date that felt weak or that let me down.

Definitely a great addition for the video library of anyone who likes the Western genre, or who likes solid character and good role models in the primary characters, and a strengthening of the ideas of justice, fair play, the rule of law, and even compassion and wisdom throughout.",1471564800,,883,4.966216216216216

5319309,5,B009DA74DY,"This is the season when the show went to an hour long format. They had not yet developed their footing for an hour long story and there were some significant growth changes along the way. The stories become less about the leading characters and more about the characters that make up the stories. They go in depth into who the characters are, and where they come from or are going to. This was a transitional season and initially it tried to maintain the half hour shows format, but grew into the hour format. I won't say that the stories are better because that goes without saying. If you can tell a story in an hour, it has to be better than the same story you would tell in half an hour. The gaps you felt existed in the half hour format, no longer exist in the hour format.

As for the stories themselves, they are rock solid Gunsmoke with the main characters intact. I thoroughly enjoyed this season and highly recommend it to any fan of any westerns, but especially Gunsmoke fans.",1416009600,2,987,4.423076923076923

5319311,5,B009DA74DY,In my opinion Gunsmoke is one of the all-time classic western shows. The shows are well written so the whole family can enjoy them. Sadly this is not the cast with some TV show on television today. DVD reviews are hard to write because is it all personal preference. If you like the show you will enjoy it,1411516800,,305,4.275862068965517

5319313,5,B009DA74DY,"Have all the Gunsmokes up to this one.  Without Chester, the series wasn't the same.  Also, after the fifth, the studio setting was a low point.  The characters are iconic, what can you say that hasn't been said before?  Great!",1404604800,,227,4.6
5319314,5,B009DA74DY,"When this was on TV, it was like looking forward to visits with the family each week.  Love those westerns.",1402444800,,107,4.35
5319325,5,B009DA74DY,"I bought this DVD set for one episode -- Milly, which in 1961 presented a young actress named Jena Engstrom with what I beleive was her best acting opportunity of her short 4-year career.  She left acting after suffering what was described in the newspapers of the time as a nervous breakdown.  Milly is the story of a teenaged girl who lives in poverty with her younger brother because their father spends all his money on drink.  Milly's friend excaped poverty when she married a rancher and Milly decides the way out of poverty for her and her brother is for her to marry a rich older man.  She visits three men and each rejects her proposal, mainly because they don't take her seriously.  Once rejected Milly seeks revenge by vandalizing their property.  Two of the men hate each other and blame one another for the vandalism, which leads to a life-threatening result for the two men.  The thing I found interesting about Gunsmoke as a TV series is that often the stars to supporting roles in the stories and the guests, Jena Engstrom in this case, were given opportunities to shine.",1401062400,2,1087,4.630208333333333
5319326,5,B009DA74DY,"Season seven of Gunsmoke brought about the biggest change in the program. Episodes were extended to one hour and whilst many fans may have preferred the shorter version, I think the longer ones were better, allowing plot lines and characterizations to be more developed.  This batch of episodes includes wonderful guests like John Dehner, Lois Nettleton, John Larch, Buddy Ebsen, Peter Whitney and R.G. Armstrong.  Dennis Weaver who directed three programs in the previous season gets to helm one of the best ""Marry Me"",  but most of the directing chores are handled by the accomplished Harry Harris Jr. and Andrew McLaglen and the quality scripts are mainly by the brilliant John Meston and Kathleen Hite.
They may not have existed in real life but Matt, Chester, Kitty and Doc, as played by James Arness, Dennis Weaver, Amanda Blake and Milburn Stone made these characters so imprinted in our conscience that most of us are convinced that they really did inhabit Dodge City.  The image of Dodge will always revolve around this superb series which is a credit to all the fine crafts people associated with it during twenty meritorious years.",1397347200,24,1142,4.994736842105263

5319329,5,B009DA74DY,"I enjoy watching Gunsmoke, especially the episodes involving the character , Chester.  This series is very entertaining and at the same time shows the strengths and weaknesses of its main characters.  I particularly like the way this series does draw a line between good and bad. This in my view is a strength. I like hour long of the seventh season.",1388448000,,350,4.721311475409836
5319330,5,B009DA74DY,Gunsmoke was the longest running western for various reasons. The actors and actresses to include the child stars made this show everything that in turn made the series last as long as it did. The child actors and actresses have moved forward to be some of the stars today as adults. It is amazing to go back and see some of these persons then relate to what they do today.,1388361600,2,373,4.3428571428571425

5319338,5,B009DA74DY,"I am 64 years old and, of course, grew up with ""Gunsmoke.""  I enjoyed the show in my youth, but appreciate it even more considering what passes for programming on TV now.  Gunsmoke had the richest characterizations, the best dialog, and the most poignant plots of any series, Western or not.  No other leading man could hold a candle to James Arness then and he had the note of authenticity not many other actors have ever matched.

I have now watched the first seven seasons of ""Gunsmoke"" and can honestly say I was never disappointed by a single episode.  How many other series I could have said the same about is very problematic.  Glory be to ""Gunsmoke!""",1376265600,2,658,4.581196581196581

5319340,5,B009DA74DY,"Though I feel that the half hour Gunsmoke was a bit better than this one hour season, most of the episodes were still good, some even great. The original main actors are so good and one wants to see them as much as possible. When the center is on some other actors, they are often not as interesting. Long, long trail was really a touching story. Barbara Lord was simply wonderful in this episode. And James Arness, too.

I have now watched half of the volume 2 of the seventh season. What I said applies to this second volume, too. Half Straight, The Gallows and He Learned About Women were particularly good. I may order the next volumes, though the prize has increased a bit too much. I do not like Festus, which makes one hesitate buying. I know that many expect him, but I don't. I do not appreciate his kind of humor. Chester is more likable and difficult to compensate.",1369008000,,876,4.407407407407407

5319377,5,B009DA74DY,"I actually preferred the half hour format,
which was 27 minutes, as opposed to today's
18 minutes. Probably because of the single
sponsor.  CBS provided the entire season in
one box for the first year, and then apparently
discovered it could get more money by selling
two half seasons.  I like the old Gunsmoke well
enough to put up with this, as CBS probably
expected.  I will keep buying the series until
Chester leaves, which is in the 9th season I
believe. After that, Arness is seldom there for
full hour, if at all, and the series is carried by
Doc, Kitty, and whoever else is put on board.",1355788800,21,596,4.4495412844036695
5319378,3,B009DA74DY,"First off I agree ... these Split Seasons are dreadful...  While some people state its done in order to make more money for the studio , My main gripe is when it is all said Ill have 40 DVD cases when 20 would have sufficed Not to mention 40 seperate shipments , orders etc... and it seems to take alot longer to get things released. I don't mind paying more for Gunsmoke than other shows since Gunsmoke is a BETTER show than others... Check out the Cost on Star Trek seasons compared to Gunsmoke....

Another thing that bothers me and this is about the show itself in Season 7 .... While I like the unpredictability of the endingss it seems like they all end on a sad note ( season 7, Vol 1)... My wife finds this particular Season overall to be depressing . I have to agree .. I recall the  later color episodes beeing more happy and balanced...",1355702400,4,847,4.28125

5319380,5,B009DA74DY,"Gunsmoke is a great series. Season 7 is where they went to the hour format. When I started watching the first episode, I couldn't figure out why it seemed like I had seen it recently. Same thing with the second episode. Then I read about the rest of the episodes - these were the episodes shown on Encore Western, so they were rerun many times on Encore. I agree with everyone else...the fact they ""split"" the seasons ends up making Gunsmoke a little pricey in the long run, but it's easier for me (personally) to come up with $25 a hit than $50. But then we have to wait twice as long for the rest of the season to come out too. It's a trade off. At any rate, Gunsmoke was a great show. Personally, I will only ""probably"" buy up to (and including) season 10, as they were in B/W. I feel the stories were better. By season 10, it seemed like Matt Dillon wasn't in the episodes as much either. Just wasn't the same.",1354406400,9,914,4.198863636363637
5319381,5,B009DA74DY,"Really looking forward to these 1 hour versions. Who's in charge over there at CBS distribution? What are you, 20? You think you'll last forever. Hint: you won't. Judging by the comments so far, those of us born in the 30s, 40s and 50s want to leave our grandchildren complete sets, not half sets. Please get it in gear for those of us who aren't!",1352937600,6,347,4.3538461538461535

complete series.",1349913600,6,98,3.5
5319383,5,B009DA74DY,"Can't review a product not yet released but can talk about the quality of the shows.  Although it took a few episodes for the writers to adjust to the one-hour format & decide how to fill twice as much time, these are still classic shows...and soon the longer format allowed for more characterization and complex plots.  The best news is that (so far) the studio is charging the same amount for the longer shows as for the 1/2-hour episodes.  Also, they seem to be releasing them at a much faster pace. Hope they maintain both practices (doesn't seem that we'll see complete-season sets anytime soon).",1349568000,28,601,4.704761904761905
5319384,5,B009DA74DY,"Love the series, grew up with it.  Hope I live another 15 years to be able to watch them all again.  Please put them out quarterly to accommodate us old folks.

Sincerely,

Cookie Grandma",1349136000,23,187,4.411764705882353
