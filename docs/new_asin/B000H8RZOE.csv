8137587,3,B000H8RZOE,"I had heard that men need to get PSA tests starting at the age of 50, but this work says they should start at 40.  The work is filled with doctors and everyday grandfathers speaking about prostate cancer.  The tacit message is ""If you don't get checked for yourself, do it for your wife, children, and grandchildren.""

I am an African-American male and I think the coverage of African-American males could have been better.  The work does state that Black men should get tested 5 years before other men.  Still, there were no testimonies from African-American prostate patients.  The work had an African-American reporter in it, but he wasn't speaking as an interested party.  Plus, he looked 20 years old and was given a bad gray die job to make him look older.  Basically, this work gives European-American viewers men with which to identify, but it fails to provide the same thing for Black men.

The work begins and stresses PSA tests, then at the last second, it says a digital-rectal exam will be needed too.  One doctor calls it ""the dreaded digital-rectal exam.""  However, it is never spelled out why this procedure is ""dreaded"" and why men need to get over their ""dread.""  Though the work is informative, it speeds past an important topic and thus renders the topic ""nefarious"" when it should have been aimed at the opposite goal.",1198627200,,1339,4.748917748917749
