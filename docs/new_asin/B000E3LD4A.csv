Well, after using the training techniques in this video, I can happily say that I am more energetic, in better shape, and thinner. And believe me, I was skeptical.
I'm looking for more videos by Heather Rider but I can't seem to find any. Are there anymore out there? Please let me know!",1231977600,,436,4.395061728395062
8422985,5,B000E3LD4A,"As a person who has never liked working out at home, I can honestly say this dvd is one that I actually look forward to doing. Heather is very enthusiastic and energetic and shows you that working out can be fun - the musical references she uses for the steps make it interesting as well as easy to remember. She is very easy to follow, and gives great direction and cues when things are going to change. She's also really good about telling you different ways to adapt it to your own personal level of ability. The video incorporates many different aspects of exercise, and includes a great warm-up and cool-down, making it the perfect all-in-one workout dvd. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to add to their exercise routine - you'll be glad you ordered it!",1231891200,,773,4.5285714285714285
