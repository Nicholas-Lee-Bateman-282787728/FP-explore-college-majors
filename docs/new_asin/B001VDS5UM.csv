8346044,5,B001VDS5UM,"Hear Dave's great commentary as he lap's the Island on a very strong vintage grand prix machine.
Nice to hear a American's perspective and David Ropers active racing years span many, many decades.",1425427200,,196,4.96969696969697
8346045,5,B001VDS5UM,Another chance to hear some the great vintage racing motorcycles of all time.  Running at speed.  Certainly worth a listen.,1385337600,,123,5.1
8346046,5,B001VDS5UM,It is the only video I have seen featuring a full onboard lap of the IoM on a British single cylinder machine.,1383436800,,110,4.045454545454546
8346047,5,B001VDS5UM,"I have watched this video often enough on the Web to realize that i ought to own the DVD.

What I like? The venue (IOM), the bike (classic British iron), the rider (Dave Roper).
What I dislike?  The rarity of similar videos.
Who might like that video? Anybody with a reverence for the IOM and classic bikes. (And such persons might also like the Benelli 350 runs and Dave Roper's blog.)",1380758400,,386,4.422535211267606
