3100694,5,B0012Z36EE,THE TITLE SAYS IT ALL! THE ONLY THING I DONT LIKE IS THAT THE SHOW IS A 1/2 HOUR NOT A FULL HOUR!,1214006400,,97,3.260869565217391
3100695,5,B0012Z36EE,"I was so happy when The Big Gay Sketch Show came out on DVD, when the second season became available I had to have it. Even though some of the cast has changed it is still jammed with funny skits and special guest surprises. When's season 3 coming out?",1212796800,,252,4.163265306122449
3100696,4,B0012Z36EE,"The ""Dynasty"" sketch and the ""May-December Romance"" sketch are my favorites.  Julie Goldman is a true gift, especially as Natalie in the ""Facts of Life"" and ""Super Liza"" sketchs.  Great fun.  Maya Angelou never looked so good.  There are a few misteps, but for the most part it is very funny, even the closing comments by Rosie O'Donnell and Chastiy Bono are fun.  The only reason i gave it 4 out of 5 was there should have been more bonus footage, especially bloopers out outakes.",1210291200,2,481,4.6117647058823525

3100699,5,B0012Z36EE,I SO wish there were more seasons to this show! Marvelous! I tried to watch one episode at a time but was always compelled to watch 3 or 4.,1361491200,,139,3.8275862068965516
3100700,5,B0012Z36EE,"We love ""The Big Gay Sketch Show.""  It is exactly like ""Saturday Night Live"", only with gay-oriented themes.  Very Hysterical!!",1300838400,,127,5.3
3100701,5,B0012Z36EE,"I can't say enough about how funny this show is! The DVD version is UNCENSORED and this is one of the rare times where profanity is actually essential to the humor in some skits. It's a riot. I am laughing myself silly as I write this. The second season IS DEFINITELY funnier than the first season, and all of the performers are well into their roles in any skit they're in.

Erika Ash as ""Grandma Bell"" is absolutely the best, as well as her skits as fitness instructor, ""Latanya."" (DO NOT take a bite or drink of anything while her skits are playing---you WILL spew across the room!!! You've been warned!) She and Colman Domingo bring the warmth, charm and hilarity of African American humor full circle, which is what I always love. You see a skit with Erika, you're gonna laugh yourself silly.

And Paolo Andino? SEXY! The sight of his bare hairy chest and thunderbolt legs is quite a treat and has me stopping and pausing quite a bit just to stare. My kind of man, indeed.

Also unforgettable is ""Fitzwilliam's"" quest to once and for all get a ""va-jyyyyna!"" I had a headache before I put this DVD on and, thanks to all of the hilarity that I have watched, the endorphins released by laughing has brought an end to it. It takes a lot to make me laugh this hard, by the way.

This is a mix of SNL and IN LIVING COLOR, just tailor made for us gays. I really can't say enough great things about this show, and this is one DVD that probably will truly meet the 100,000 playbacks before it dies. I hope the show goes on for many, many years, and that this current cast stays with it. Everyone is absolutely hysterical, and no one, in my opinion, has a dull part. They are all great look-alikes for the various celebrities they parody---especially Colman Domingo as ""Oprah."" UNBELIEVEABLE!

For the LGBT community, we NEED this kind of variety sketch because we can see the differences as well as the similarities within our genres. So many times we beat each other up---I don't know why---and this just shows how great we can laugh at ourselves. I have a ton of thanks for the predominant lesbian presence both on screen and behind the scenes as producers, writers, directors. I love lesbians, and this show just reinforces why. Rosie O'Donnell has done a great job in handling this show as executive producer. Amanda Bearse (""Marcy"" on ""Married With Children"") and legendary comedienne Kate Clinton bring such talent with them as well to make this diamond of a show shine. I would love to be in the room when this show is being written and drafted.

Anyone wondering whether or not to buy this series, GET IT. It's campy sketch humor; it's not meant to change the world, just make its statement as comedy and make us forget all the hate and hassles we deal with in daily life. This allows us to laugh off what we can. I can't say enough about this series or Sordid Lives. Outrageously funny, and worth every recession-gripped dollar shelled out for it.

Buy the DVDs, and make a statement to the creators of the series that it needs to go on. Popularity can foster longevity. Grandma Bell is back on, so I'm ending this review here. (Randy)",1253664000,,3140,4.507908611599297
3100702,2,B0012Z36EE,"The first season was better. Unfortunately, this one seems to have been taken over by a gang of 12 year old boy writers. If you like crude, gross humor that involves bodily functions, then this is ideal for you. However, if you prefer intellectual, clever comedy, then you're not going to like this. The cast seems to be having a good time, but I found these episodes almost unwatchable. The extras, including interviews with cast members, are slightly interesting, but it seems padded.",1231027200,,486,4.867469879518072
3100703,5,B0012Z36EE,"Simply brilliant. I'm in stitches every episode, over and over. As another review said - you can literally watch these sketches again and again and it never gets old. OMG Grandma Bell. Its worth 15 bucks just for her. The whole cast is spectacular and the skits are spot on (whether you want to admit it or not). And of course, what a wonderful addition to gay television. For the people by the people, you know?

Logo is INSANE for not airing this show more often. Indeed it is the homo version of SNL - when SNL was GOOD.

And if I am correct, they rely on DVD quota sales in order to be signed onto the next season, so pay [...] AND the chance to watch another season next year. What a steal!!",1226966400,,696,4.186567164179104

3100705,5,B0012Z36EE,"The second season really found its way compared to the first.  The charactors had ""matured"" (some of them much like old cheese).  The sketches were funnier although there were some that fell flat.  I had the urge to listen to Grandma Bell on my earbuds even in my own house.  In fact, my neighbor moved away a week after I played that sketch and I'm nervous that the two are related.
I laughed so hard at the Paula Dean and Jenny Craig sketches that I was afraid I would pass out and be found face down on the living room carpet with the other end pointed to the heavens.  All I can say is, ""Sir! Take my money.  This DVD is worth any price!""",1217203200,2,642,4.137096774193548

I really missed all of the ""Celesbian Interviews"" on the extras DVD and had hoped that there would be as many - if not more - as season 1.  I was also hoping for more from ""Sapho's Lips"" as well.  I'm gonna sell my copy back to a used DVD store.",1214179200,,518,3.9805825242718447

I actually own the DVD set of this show when it aired, i sprcifically purchased this episode so i can show friends when im out and about, on my phone! From the second this skit starts to the very last board, I STILL roll. It's one of those skits you have to watch a hundred times to appreciate every little detail and ones you may have missed  from laughing so hard the first couple times around. The other skits are very funny well,  I liked and miss this show very much, but to make it in MY neurotic, A.D.D., psychotic, wacky, head as one om my ALL TIME skits, its F U N N Y !  Written and performed and cast superbly !!! Thank you for the laughs !!!!  GET THIS, RENT IT, BUY IT, STREAM IT, IT 8S WORTH THE SMALL FEE !!!!!!!!!!",1490140800,,884,4.034285714285715
