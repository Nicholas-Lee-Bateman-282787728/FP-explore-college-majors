8206230,5,B000SQFBW8,"My daughter is horse-obsessed.  We have every child-appropriate horse movie made since 1943 (The Red Pony, starring Robert Mitchum). The Saddle Club series is great because they actually spend time grooming the horse and ""mucking"" which in horse talk I guess means cleaning the stalls.
She also loves the music. One of the side stories involves a girl band. Most of their gigs are at the mall and the local ice cream parlor-no scenes where they're onstage in Britney Spears type outfits.
Good series for any horse-lover at least 9 years old (there is a little bit of the boyfriend-girlfriend stuff).",1286150400,4,599,4.930693069306931
