7595066,5,B01A7RP1BI,This was and is the BEST cop show I ever watched. I've seen every episode on TNT and now enjoy them again and again on DVD. The entire cast fit perfect together. I was sad when Kyra decided to move on because this show could have lasted forever.,1401408000,3,245,4.125
7595067,5,B01A7RP1BI,"There were several suppliers provided by Amazon.  I chose the cheapest one with some trepidation since we once got a Chinese version from other on-line store..  This was full version and full quality, so we saved some money.",1400544000,,224,4.868421052631579
7595068,4,B01A7RP1BI,season 3 is messed up a little and keeps freezing. The rest of the seasons are great though. Thank You,1400371200,,102,4.15
7595069,5,B01A7RP1BI,"Kyra Sedgewick and the rest of the cast do an excellent job interacting with each other.  It is the subtleties, from comments to facial expressions, that make the show.  We have watched every episode over the last seven years, and now we get to re-live those memorable moments.",1395446400,2,277,4.75
7595070,5,B01A7RP1BI,"My very favorite series. we don't have cable so I first got the seasons from the library - it's hard to watch 13 episodes of anything in 1 week - but we did. then it was on TV , but not always, and some episodes we missed. We for the last season and watched over a weekend and were hooked all over again.  The actors are a great ensemble, the writing is sharp and Brenda's character is so complete, warts and all. There enough suspense, not too much gore and great humor.

April 5, 2014 -update. One big problem. When we got to the 3rd disc in the second season, it was defective and would not load. We tried it an all our players and no luck. Then when we checked Amazon return we found we needed to return etc by Jan. 31; so nothing we can do. We will have to buy a new 3rd season - all 4 discs, even though it's only one bad disc.  We did what we should have done right away - checked all the rest of the discs - luckily there weren't any more bad ones. I'm sure the problem is with the manufacturer, but it's still a bummer.

A tip: When I was trying to figure out what to do we looked at links here and one was if your disc won't load. that lead us a link to update the player. We were able to go to the sony web site and watch directions on how to download the update and creat a disc to use - now all our players are updated.  Consider checking this out!",1392681600,10,1361,3.9166666666666665

I enjoyed the presentation on every episode but when I got to season 7, disc 2, I ran into trouble: the disc could not be read on any of the several DVD and Blu-ray players I have.

7595080,5,B01A7RP1BI,This is one of the finest series ever made for TV. The character-driven plots are seamless and each member of the cast is a story in itself. Kyra Sedgwick is masterful. Worth every penny.  One I'll watch over the years.,1500940800,,219,4.475

Characters are strong and fun to watch.  My advice is buy it and watch.  I will be continue watching MAJOR CRIMES also.  THUMBS WAY WAY UP!!!",1491264000,,315,4.7592592592592595

Very glad to have the complete series. I do enjoy Major Crimes and that they kept all the cast. Maybe when it discontinues we will want that series too.,1491264000,,297,4.518518518518518

7595089,5,B01A7RP1BI,Kyra Sedgwick's best work. A favorite show of mine. I wish she would star in more movies and television shows. I'm finally able to relive some of my favorite moments of the closer. Not even the new show can compare to the classic original. Can't wait to hear Brenda say that woman!,1483747200,,281,4.423076923076923

7595091,5,B01A7RP1BI,One of the best TV shows. Drama & comedy of people doing an unpleasant and at times horrible job with heart and human foibles.,1412985600,,126,4.291666666666667
7595092,5,B01A7RP1BI,"I gave it 5 stars just because I love the show itself.  I just received it, so I haven't opened it to see if all of them are OK.
I'll give another review when I get a chance to check out each DVD.",1412208000,,196,3.558139534883721
7595093,5,B01A7RP1BI,What a delightful series this was. There is enough difference in each episode to make for an enjoyable diversion from the format which made the series interesting.,1410048000,,163,5.074074074074074
7595094,3,B01A7RP1BI,The fact that there are no English subtitles for the hard of hearing/deaf was a bit of a disappointment. Also I had to pay nearly 25. postage. That upset me greatly. Otherwise so far I'm pleased but I haven't seen all of the box sets to date only the first one.,1408492800,2,261,4.137254901960785

Bundle was in great condition! No problems",1408233600,,79,5.153846153846154
7595096,5,B01A7RP1BI,"I just loved ""The Closer"" and the way the characters are portrayed -- a little over the top but always human. While a viewer might want to throttle Brenda sometimes, one has to admire her dedication to law enforcement and her ability to ""close"" the case. It's intense viewing with touches of humor and empathy, and always character-driven.",1407715200,,339,4.862068965517241
7595097,3,B01A7RP1BI,"Having become a big fan of Major Crimes I decided to watch The Closer to see how the characters developed over the years.  As I started to watch the first season I found that it did not have English Closed Captions.  Being hearing impaired this become a big problem trying to understand what was being said.  I later found that the instant video version on Amazon has closed Caption so I will be watching the first season online.  The case for season 2 - 7 indicate CC but I guess I will have to wait and see.

If it was not for the lack of Closed Captions I would probably rate this show higher.",1406678400,6,596,4.192982456140351
7595098,3,B01A7RP1BI,"The show is alright but unlike all the other reviewers, I wouldn't give it 5 stars. Now i've seen alot of episodes of this show & what I don't like about it is all of her ""Call in a favor"" deals whenever she's in trouble. Seems whenever she doe's something wrong, all she has to do is call someone & they fix it. She's an LAPD police chief or whatever & she can't even follow the rules that she enforces. Since she's a woman though, it's funny & what not. I think what really sucks about shows like this is that you always have the main person who in the end figures out the murders, all the other people just give ideas here & there that assisst the main character in comming to his or her conclusion. This is why ""Law & Order"" is like the best police style show of all time because solving crimes are a group effort & when police officers themselves screw up, they're held accountable...",1405382400,,889,4.235294117647059

7595100,5,B01A7RP1BI,"Love that Brenda and how the tiniest everyday occurrence solves the mystery.  All the supporting personalities are so real and believable,",1403395200,,138,5.571428571428571
7595101,5,B01A7RP1BI,"In the great white north this show never got airred due to the, never mind I'll just start ranting.
The cast of characters in this series makes the show which at times seems more like a comedy than a police show.  There are some moments in this series when the interplay between G.W. Bailey and Tony Denison simply take over and you want them to keep going and forget the actual plot!
When faced with seven seasons all at once you'll surprises at how easy it is to forget everything else and watch this.",1402012800,3,503,4.351063829787234
8746642,5,B01A7RP1BI,"I enjoyed every episode except the last disc, #5, season 7. The ""gag"" reel was jumbled, pixelated. The funniest part of the entire season and it wasn't viewable. Disappointing!",1536883200,,176,5.103448275862069

8746647,5,B01A7RP1BI,"haven't actually viewed these dvd's because I just received them, but I love the show.  I used to watch them on Netflix or Amazon Video but now you have to pay for them.  So I figured why not just buy the dvds.  Luckily I found just one left of the full 7 seasons so I nabbed it.  The set's about $40 cheaper than buying each season separately.  A good deal indeed.  But I would have bought each season had the set not been available.  The dynamic storylines and the interaction between the detectives is funny, dramatic and thoroughly enjoyable.  Flynn and Provenza are a riot together.  Brenda Johnson's southern accent drove me crazy at first.  I thought it was over the top.  But since moving down here to Georgia I realize that's the way many people talk, so she was spot-on.  Delivery was extremely fast too.  Usually, with Amazon Prime, I receive my orders in two business days but I received these the next day. Great!",1529712000,,926,4.506024096385542
