8594436,1,B00DMB8KPQ,"I had such high hopes for this ""documentary,"" as I am a huge fan of RO. This is not a doc about him--he has about 7 minutes of screen time. The first 45 minutes is filmed so badly that it is essentially incoherent, interviews with Karen Black? Seriously? Ed Ruscha? This is a film about Michele Lamy, his muse. Don't waste your money. You can get better interviews on YouTube.",1455753600,,376,4.385714285714286

8594438,4,B00DMB8KPQ,"3=1 The Films of Jan Sharp takes on documentaries in an unconventional and intriguing way. With all three films shot with a handheld camera, viewers get almost an inside scoop of the three subjects Jan Sharp focuses on. It is clear that Jan had some kind of relationship with all of her subjects because we get the feel that we are part of their lives, unlike traditional documentaries where the audience feels as if they are an outsider looking in, with these as the viewer, we really feel like we are just a part of their every day lives; presumably as she was.

Rick, Michele and Scarlett focuses on the relationship between these three friends, and how intertwined Rick and Michele's lives are. It also emphasizes their life long friendship as it follows them from Michele's eccentric cafe in L.A. (with many guests appearances, like the artist Ed Ruscha) to Rick's fashion show in Paris.

Beard: Pecking Order showed the behind the scenes of the great work of Peter Beard. This documentary showed his humor and seriousness about his job and showed the work put behind capturing the the beautiful photographs he took while in Africa.

Chasing the President follows President Jose Ramos Horta of East Timor on his peace mission as he is helping school children, visiting different towns, and demonstrating his family values.

They were three very different documentaries with the likeness in that all the people focused on in these documentaries enjoyed their jobs, had immense dedication, and believed in what they were doing. Any fan of Rick Owens, or of fashion and even photography should see these documentaries.",1375747200,,1620,4.944852941176471
