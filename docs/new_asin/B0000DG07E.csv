1924442,5,B0000DG07E,"I first saw ""The Warrior Within"" on TV as a kid in Hong Kong and I thought it was great. That was around the time I started my martial arts training.  Since then, I have owned two copies, gave one to a fellow martial artist and seen it more than 50(?) times at least.  It always brings me back to what the martial arts are about and why I started training. I still watch it every now and then to this day. Martial Arts are a way of life to me and this is the perfect documentary for someone like that.  Seeing some of the greats in their heyday and listening to them speak is inspirational and exciting.  I only wish I could have had the pleasure and honour of meeting them.  This video is a definite must for every martial artist and for anyone interested in Eastern philosophy and making the world a better place.",1006560000,12,815,4.198717948717949

1924444,4,B0000DG07E,I was a student of Dan Inosanto since 1976. I remembered when the producer was getting all of these martial artists segments together. He wrote up a contract to pay each one a substantial amount for their participation. But he had them sign a contract for A PENNY! And later renigged on the original deal. The artists tried to sue but couldn't . Because that PENNY contract was binding and legal! He ripped off all of these artists on the DVD!,1336694400,,443,4.481481481481482
1924445,5,B0000DG07E,My dad owned the original VHS video tape of this (he STILL HAS IT!). I used to watch this almost everyday as a child until I knew all of the masters names and the name of every weapon used in the film. I was a devoted Bruce Lee admirer and still am. This film helped me understand the mindset of what it means to be a true martial artist instead of just someone who likes to fight. I had not seen the film in over a decade and I was thrilled when my DVD arrived. It was like being eight years old all over again with my snacks and soda and my favorite movie!! MEMORIES!! : ),1290729600,,574,3.9145299145299144
1924446,4,B0000DG07E,"The title and description are slightly misleading. There is a bit about Bruce Lee, some interviews with his family. It talks a little bit about his impact in bringing real martial arts to mainstream America, and showing the martial arts the way it really is, without wires and funny Asians with huge Fu Manchu mustaches. I wish it dealt more with Bruce Lee than it did.

Most of the short documentary is interviews with martial arts masters: jujitsu, both tiger and eagle kung fu, karate, kenpo, and kung fu weapons. As advertised, there is a very, very young Chuck Norris teaching Tang Soo Do and beating up a little kid. The interviews are very good and some of them are very funny, especially the huge jujitsu master throwing his students around like rag dolls. All of the interviews are very frank and very honest.

All in all a very enjoyable DVD that should be in the collection of every martial artist. I took off a star for false advertising; I imagine there is a movie about Bruce Lee's impact on American martial arts cinema, but this is not it.",1282521600,,1055,4.576719576719577

1924449,4,B0000DG07E,"This doesn't feature any footage of Bruce Lee apart from a few stills and some mention of his influence. However in all other respects the rest of the film is first class.

Leading experts from various martial arts areas (Kendo, various forms of Karate, Jujitsu, Kung Fu, Tai Chi as well as weapons experts etc) are all shown demonstrating their skills with devastating effectiveness and discussing them with equal facility.

Amongst the better known martial artists are:
Chuck Norris
Dan Inosanto
Master Poi Chen
Mike Stone
Master Moses Powell

Unlike one of the previous critical reviewers I actually found the Jujitsu master the most impressive of all the guys on display. The truth is they are, or at least were, amongst the very best at the time the film was made. Criticising from behind the keyboard 30 years after these guys were at their peak, is I think a little unfair!

Highly recommended to anyone interested in martial arts.",1206316800,,938,4.880503144654088
1924450,5,B0000DG07E,"""The Warrior Within"" is a movie about Martial Arts and a very good one. The production crew superbly handled the project. It is well conceived and well executed and with good commentary. The color cameras use slow motion picture, repeats of shots from numerous angles and explore individual reasons behind why each artist persevered in his art. The reasons range from a curiosity about this athletic ability, to exposure in the military service and a desire to triumph over bullies. This is a moving, thorough examination of the current practice of the martial arts and their effect on practitioners' lives.

""Warrior Within"" begins as a salute to the late, great Bruce Lee and is dedicated to his memory. The film shows the effect Bruce Lee had on the lives of the people around him and to those who studied and worked with him. But then, the film roves around California, New York and Puerto Rico to explore how the martial arts have taken root there, and who practices them. Several narrations on the origin of the martial arts are interspersed throughout the film. Each narration is accompanied with a scenic view of martial art past and present. What emerges in the content of this film is something of a revelation, the cool of the martial artists as they became more and more dedicated to the art and the philosophy behind it. They seem to exude an air of confidence that was captured on film. More than that, they seemed to have a key to survival that went one step beyond what everyone else seemed to have come up with.

Martial Arts fans will have the opportunity to see many of their favorites in action. During this intense study, the viewer is bombarded with a series of top rated martial artists such as: Chuck Norris, Dan Inosanto, Fumio Demura, Master Ron Taganashi, Master Moses Powell, Master Florendo Visitasion, Chaka Zulu, Master Poi Chen, Hui Cambrelen, Master Wai Hong and many others. The performances are uniformly excellent and the technical credits are superb. The entire project turned out to be an excellent analysis and study of the contemporary martial artist and how he molds, shapes and controls his ""Warrior Within"". Their final product is a top notch audiovisual representation of the 20th century martial arts. This is definitely a must see film. Highly Recommended!",1180569600,2,2302,4.869897959183674

1924452,5,B0000DG07E,"First of all let me say that if you are looking for hardcore action, legs breaking, and fancy flips, and gymnastics. This isn't for you. This was made in the 70's so don't be surprised with the crappy picture and sound quality. However with that said, I have always loved this documentary. I first saw it 18 years ago at the age of ten. Once I saw it I joined my first martial arts dojo. And since then took a long hard and exciting journey in the martial arts world. Despite what some critics on here say, these are REAL masters and many are still alive and VERY WELL RESPECTED in the martial arts community. This documentary goes into brief descriptions of different arts such as Karate, Tiger Claw Gung Fu, Tai chi Chuan, Jujitsu and a few others. While interviewing respected masters in those styles. They speak about their personal experiences, views on life, and what it means being a martial arts master. It's a must for any serious martial artist who isn't in it for just hurting people.",1179100800,3,995,4.533333333333333
1924453,2,B0000DG07E,"I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about. Maybe they are the film distributors as well. I just saw this recently and thought it was one the funniest things I've seen. But the comedy is totally unintentional.

This was made in the 70s and documents nicely the delusional attitude to martial arts the western world had in that period.

The 'enlightenment' aspect of martial arts tied in nicely with the hippie peace, love and understanding ideal, and together with Bruce Lee's all conquering 'Enter the Dragon' bringing in every tough guy wannabe - well how could it not have been huge !

Speaking of Bruce Lee, his brother Robert Lee does some of the music here, adding to the hilarity. He wasn't hired for his talent, and him trying to croon a slow dreamy ballad 'The Warrior Within' will bring a smile to your face every time you watch.

Many of the 'masters' interviewed are inner city african americans, and come across as wannabe enlighten ghetto gangsters. My favourite was the master who would spar 'full on' (which apparently means no contact at all) with his students - while wearing 70s style sunglasses. THAT IS BADASS !!

This doco actually does feature someone talking about the dangers of attackers entering his 'circle of death'. Apparently anyone that enters his circle of death when he's in attack mode is going to get it - even his mother ! But apparently she wouldn't enter, 'because she knows better'. That right there is by far the best part of the movie, and possibly the greatest line ever committed to film.

Also, watch out for the jiu jitsu master who has all his students talk about how graceful his rolling around is despite his large girth. Lots of slow motion shots follow of this large man doing forward rolls.

Some of them have the noble idea that teaching inner city youths their martial arts will help decrease youth violence and gang activity. You can't argue with that idea, although judging from the 1980s it probably didn't work that well.

There is too much comedy gold to list it all here. The only ones that seemed rational were Chuck Norris, Dan Inosanto and Mike Stone - 3 guys who were all actual friends of Bruce Lee and all engaged in fighting with actual contact... Mike Stone openly makes fun of some masters who are full of it.

A DVD anniversary edition would be AWESOME. I'd love to see a 'where are they now?' feature showing all the masters. I wonder if the circle of death expanded or contracted with age ?

In the end its a wonderful time capsule of the martial arts hysteria that took over the world in the early 70s and really continued into the 90s until the Gracie family and mixed martial arts cleared out the rubbish - which was Bruce Lee's goal in the first place...",1140652800,8,2743,4.602459016393443
1924454,1,B0000DG07E,"I just got this DVD, I am re-selling it. What a wast of money. The quality of sound and picture is terrible. The Martial arts demonstration is OK, but not practical as it says. It is not very well organized, and has no focal point of the film. I am like WHAT IS THE POINT? Just a bunch of mixed up corny film to me....very disappointed.",1105056000,3,336,4.106060606060606
1924455,5,B0000DG07E,"While dated, one of the better documentaries for its time ever made about the martial arts.  Although the movie is dated, it provides a wonderful commentary about the various Asian martial arts as practice by many different people from different walks of life.  Everyone feature is a great martial artist in their own right.  Some episodes are extremely interesting to watch and listen such as Ron Taganashi, Chaka Zulu, Fumio Demura, Rabbi Alex Sternberg, Danny Inosanto, and Moses Powell.

Many different martial arts are featured including Karate, Kung Fu and Ju Jitsu.  Life experiences are intertwined with stunning demonstrations.  There is a small tribute to Bruce Lee and the only failure in the movie is the little long and dated music inserted in the movie that was performed by his brother Robert Lee (it really dates the movie and one wishes the director may have had the forethought to insert the music in a different spot- like the closing credits).

Today's younger martial artists should see this film to get an understanding of the pioneers of a generation ago who have laid the foundations participation in the arts.  Despite some flaws, the movie is still worth five stars, because of its outstanding commentaries by such an array of martial artists and the coherent direction of the film.",1081728000,5,1308,4.9953917050691246

This film has been a positive influence to all who have watched it. It's been responsible for motivating me to learn self-defense, as well as for reinforcing my self esteem, discipline & respect for all mankind. In addition, it has been instrumental in providing me with a vehicle to develop perseverance in all of life's daily aspects, a very important quality needed in today's world.

1924458,5,B0000DG07E,"This movie is really an undiscovered gem of filmaking, for martial arts students of all ages as well as for the rest of us would be martial arts students. The director illustrates with exquisite detail the beauty, spirituality and aesthetic appeal underlying the principal styles of martial arts. He uses slow-motion effect to capture the intensity and rapidity of martial arts movements. It is through these artfully timed and filmed action sequences that we see the strength of the characters as well. His usage of pastel colors juxtaposed with black helps emphasize the feelings and attitudes of the characters. The stylistic elements combined with monologue by each of the martial arts practitioners featured in the film is somewhat unusual in this genre of filmaking. I watched the film several times, and got something out of it each time. The movie is certainly enjoyable, but it is also highly educational. This is definitely a movie you should not miss.",1065139200,,962,5.094936708860759
