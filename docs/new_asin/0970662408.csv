173581,1,0970662408,"""Nutbag"" was such a mess I don't know where to begin. It's about a nameless psychopath who picks up hookers and kills them. Nothing of interest happens. Nothing. He sits in his house and talks to his pet spider about how ""all women are the same"" and lots of other cliched psycho-movie insights. Actually, that's the main problem.  The film is pretentious as hell without actually having anything to say. There is no plot. Nutbag picks up a hooker and kills her. Repeat over and over. That's the style of this film. It's 80 minutes long and I was hoping for the end after 20. It's that boring. The music is sometimes effective, but it doesn't make up for an absolutley pointless movie, one that has nothing new to offer to the genre. You'd think such a repetitive film would have a great ending, right? Wrong. There is no ending! The director even resorts to filming posters on Nutbag's bedroom walls of good horror films like ""Mother's Day"" and ""Zombie"" to remind us all how great a director he is. Needless to say, I was very disappointed.",987379200,,1040,4.561497326203209
173582,5,0970662408,"When I purchased ""Nutbag"" I wasn't sure what to expect. Needless to say I wasn't let down what so ever, The fast pace action and graphic killings kept my attention more than any ""horror"" movie I have ever seen as of late. The girls were very beautiful making it very visually appealing when there wasn't blood all over the place *L* The special effects were F-ing MAD! I am glad I picked up a copy and I definitley look forward to anything Fright Flix productions puts out, great job!",984009600,,484,4.449438202247191

7794244,3,0970662408,"""Nutbag"" may have had peanuts for a budget, but it still manages to deliver an interestingly off-kilter underground video movie from Vegas for those of us who like such things.

Separated from cheap death-fetish videos by its intensity of action, script and feeling, it bears repeated viewing for anyone who likes odd acting, a droning 80s style soundtrack and homemade slasher gore that isn't always convincing, but is usually strangely disturbing anyway.

This movie is full of weird scenes that some, with their viewpoint programmed by Hollywood to expect only certain looks and movements in a film,  would call a showcase for bad acting and directing. But I call them a forum for acting and directing from a whole different, less ""perfect"" perspective, leading to results sometimes insightful and sometimes amusing. Talking to his pet spider and only friend in his desultory room, the killer asks how everything's going. ""Yeah, I guess not much is happening anyway"" he slowly answers his own question. You'll know just by reading this if you're weird enough to like this movie as I do.

Sort of like Ron Atkins' ""Schizophreniac"" series but not nearly as manic, ""Nutbag's"" camcorder trolls the Vegas streets along with its narrating, knife-wielding psycho, who goes on at length about his hatred of other races, but not nearly as much as he goes on about his hatred of women and especially prostitutes. There is no clear indication of a sexual motive as he murders one of them after another and moves on to non-hooker women as well. It's just pure hate and rage in keeping with the movie's goal of being deliberately offensive, and anyone unprepared for this should watch the latest PG-13 rated and CGI- infected ""horror"" instead.

Aside from its silly title (""Loner"", the name of one of its music tracks, would have been better), I have little criticism for a film so no-budget yet so determined, one which provides a forum for viewing do-it-yourself filmmaking in action.

I might be alone in liking this better than ""Murder Set Pieces,"" director Palumbo's bigger-budget serial killer feature with a similar plot. Given upgraded special effects and a ""better""-looking platform for its extreme brutaliy, gore and offensiveness, ""Set Pieces"" was condemned by liberal critics when I saw it here in New York upon its limited theatrical release, and so it did us the service of bothering just the right people. But I didn't find it as interesting as the shot-on-plain-video ""Nutbag,"" which brings the little-known pleasures of underground cinema to life more effectively in my view.

Side note: actor Mack Hail directed a Nevada serial killer feature of his own called ""Switch Killer,"" and played another psycho in a VERY little-seen ""Ice Cream Man""-style serial killer SOV movie (the name of which I can't recall!) as well.",1477180800,,2824,5.034261241970022
7794245,1,0970662408,"This movie was horrible.

I read reviews saying this film was comparible to Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer and they were all wrong.

It was like watching a poorly done home movie. The main actor has the acting ability of his pet tarantula. He looks like a KKK member minus the tattoos. The effects were lousy, but I'm guessing a home movie budget. Blood looked like a little child's paint that comes in those tiny containers.
Effects such as a throat slit looked like she spilled ketchup on her throat. Pointless killings.

I understand the ""star"" was psychotic but even psychos have some reasoning. Why did he have those stupid rubber masks? The flashback to when he was a child and saw something that ""shaped his life"" had the effect of that surprised squirrel who turns around to suspenseful music.

The last few reviews all said this was a good movie, but if you scroll down a bit more you see a realistic review that also gave 1 star.

Believe us, not those other nutbags who liked this movie.",1468800000,,1002,4.544444444444444
7794246,1,0970662408,"i have tried to get this from amazon uk and my order did not arrive. the bbfc censored this film. i am convinced, the european government does not like nick polumbo very much for this one and i am ashamed of them for cutting it up. it is very difficult to get this one in its directors cut form without paying more than $100 for it. luckily i found my copy on ioffer for a sweet $9.00 as a dvd-r clone, the disc is blank with only the word nut written on it.

my only reason for this 1 star is this print not the film. i really love films like this due to the surrealism. uncut 80 min cut 67 min",1372204800,,595,3.877049180327869
7794247,1,0970662408,"Nutbag (Nick Palumbo, 2000)

Nutbag is one of those movies that was on my Amazon wish list for so long I forgot why I originally put it there. Now that I've finally gotten around to watching it, I have some vague memory of thinking that the premise--getting inside the mind of a serial killer and following him around--was a good one. After all, when it's done right (think Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer here), it's fantastic stuff. Nutbag, on the other hand, is not fantastic stuff in any way.

When you aim to get inside someone's mind, you really need some kind of character development. In order to make a good film of it, however, you not only have to develop the character of your killer, which Palumbo does (however clich his insights into his killer's psyche may be), but you have to develop some other characters as well. This is something Palumbo never gets around to doing, as no one else in the film is around long enough to be developed; it's a series of murder set pieces (to borrow the title of one of Palumbo's later works) with nothing connecting them except the killer. Each one is expressly designed to give us another piece of the killer's psyche, as well as adding to the movie's quotients of breasts and blood. While there's certainly fun to be had with breasts and blood when done correctly, this is in no way a definition of ""correct"". Killer kills. Killer pontificates. Killer stalks. Lather. Rinse. Repeat. Over and over again for what seemed like the longest seventy-five minutes of my movie-watching life. And to give the script what credit it deserves, had a really good actor played the killer, someone who could make those moments of pontificating into scenes that could bring us into some sort of empathy with the character, it might have worked in some way. Mack Hail, who plays the killer, is not a really good actor, nor even a mediocre one. He has two settings, deadpan and rage, and neither one is appropriate for the more introverted scenes that pepper the movie.

This is one to avoid. *",1233964800,,2031,4.620498614958449
7794248,4,0970662408,"If you like independant films that don't hold back on the gore, then this is a must see.  This is one of Nick Palumbo's first films and he truely unleashes his fury and lets the blood splatter.  Not for the faint of heart, so beware.

7794249,5,0970662408,"""Nutbag"" left me speechless. This film is nasty,vicious,cruel,and very near unwatchable. That being said, it is one of the best horror films I have ever seen. The fact that it was shot on digital-video with a small budget is all the more remarkable. At last,a real horror film! I have not seen a movie this powerful since John McNaughton's Henry:Portrait of a serial killer. To watch this serial killer live out his doomed life is akin to the fear I had the first time I jumped out of a plane. The way the director designed his set pieces and set up the murder scenes was simply brilliant. The photography and the lighting was amazing for a movie shot on video. The entire film was just completely engrossing and at the same time utterly depressing. This is a must see for horror fans. Nutbag will offend to be sure,but you will not be able to take your eyes off the screen.",989971200,,874,4.46875
7794250,4,0970662408,"Wow! Thank God for independent film. Hollywood would never have the guts to release something like this. ""Nutbag"" is pure insanity.  I haven't seen a slasher film like this in years.  A madman is stalking the streets of Las Vegas murdering young women.  Sound simple? This is where this movie really suprises.  It has an extremly intelligent script.  We actually get inside the mind of the murderer through voice-over. The F-X is over-the-top and brutal.  It also features tons of gorgeous (totally nude) women and a killer who is genuinely frightening. Definitely not for the ""Scream"" crowd.  This movie is a sick,very disturbing exploitation masterpiece.  I would compare it to ""Henry:Portrait of a serial killer.  My only complaint: it was shot on video. High quality, but I love film.  I hope there is a sequel.  Next time guys, shoot film!!!",989884800,6,846,4.9714285714285715
7794251,1,0970662408,"Nutbag has the hype and glossy packaging that will spark your interest and lift your hopes that THIS will be the ONE thats good, this will be the one that will make up for all the money squandered on similar product. Well...guess what? it's not! Poor direction, no budget, extremely poor special effects, Beyond bad acting and mostly, NO Storyline worth dicussing! It seems to me to be nothing but a VERY poor excuse for some guys to be filmed killing totally naked women. I have nothing against naked women, but it seems the whole budget was spent on Silicone Babes. was the director's intent to make a Horror film or a Porno film? I think he failed in both areas. A good horror film should be creepy, suspenceful, dramatic, gory, thought-provoking, even repulsive! Nutbag is none of these and it wouldn't be worth ten dollars, let alone what I paid for it. Now don't get me wrong, I haven't made a film and kudos should go to the director for doing this. But IF the director WAS inspired by the posters on the killer's wall then maybe he should have gleened some of their low-budget glory rather than making this re-hashed, mish-mashed mess. In Henry: Portriat Of A Serial Killer, the viewer dangerously empathisized with the killer, in Nutbag the viewer simply waits for the damn thing to get better or just END!",987897600,3,1315,4.6239316239316235
