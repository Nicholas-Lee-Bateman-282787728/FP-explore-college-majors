4021117,4,B002ZG99MC,"Jackie Chan has it all. He is humorous, a master martial-arts superstar, and appealing to all ages. Mom and Dad will be completely fine when the kids want to see this movie again (and again and again). Chan is charming and his co-stars add to this exciting agent next door comedy/action film.  Great for Father's Day (or Mother's Day!). ""Spying is easy.  Parenting is hard.""",1268784000,,374,4.7384615384615385
4021118,5,B002ZG99MC,"This movie is great for families, children really love it. Adults will like the heart of it and even true Jackie Chan fans will enjoy watching Jackie make films aimed at the family market and not just the ""action"" market. He can successfully do films for each group. Other reviews described the plot, I won't repeat it here. I will say it has some entertaining action as only Jackie Chan seems to do, some real heart and true family values - what makes a real family...People who are there for you, people who ""have your back"". It's even entertaning to those of us who followed the amazing career of Jackie Chan from the beginning. How will he continue to evolve his career from legendary action stunt performer to ""54 year old and beyond"" actor. He's done a nice job here. The film was never scary, the ""bad"" guys were humorous, the movie was never too slow, nor too fast and the story was easy to follow. This wasn't ""deep drama"" so the acting didn't need to be Meryl Streep calibre.",1267488000,,985,4.477777777777778
4021119,3,B002ZG99MC,"If you're looking for a decent, fun little movie you can watch with your family in a relatively painless fashion then you've come to the right place.

  For some reason many action stars have supplemented their income by appearing in movies with kids. Maybe they are trying to widen their appeal from the hardcore action audience to the family friendly scene. Maybe they're getting too old to keep up with the pace of a full-on action movie.  I don't know why they do it, but it's almost becoming mandatory for these guys to take on a kid or three as a side-kick and attempt to blend action and family fare.

  And these attempts almost always stink.

  This one is better. It's still ""action-light"" but I think it works because of the star, Jackie Chan. His character seems like a genuinely nice guy who wants to get along with the mandatory bratty kids.  Chan's light presence matches up with the tone of the movie and makes it seem ....hmm...not as weird and patently unbelievable and maybe even patronizing as other movies of this kind.

  Basically Jackie plays Bob Ho, a Chinese secret agent on loan to the CIA. He retires so he can marry Gillian, a divorced single mom who is looking for someone reliable. Her kids don't really cotton to Bob though, so she decides to put her relationship with Bob on hold until they're ok with her marrying Bob.  Bob is saddened but resolves to win the kids and his girl friend over.

Then, luckily, hijinx ensue. One of Gillian's kids downloads some top secret stuff off Bob's computer and before you can say Boris and Natasha some evil Russians are in hot pursuit. After a variety of PG style mishaps Bob captures the bad guys and wins the day, the girl friend and the family. And like I said, it works because Jackie Chan doesn't seem shoe-horned into the role.

  The action is lighter than most Chan movies but it is inventive and fun. The kids act a little more like real kids than Hollywood Central Casting pods. The youngest kid in particular seems like real 4 year old, goofy and light hearted. When she delivered the line"" I don't wanna be a princess, I wanna be a cyboooorg!"" I cracked up. I actually laughed more than a few times, which surprised me. As long as you realize going in that this is just very light family entertainment I think you'll be pleased",1265241600,31,2311,4.525301204819277
4021120,2,B002ZG99MC,"Do you know what it's like to see miscast actors fail miserably at making something out of nothing? Presenting ""The Spy Next Door."" Watching this movie is a painful experience, not only because it tells an unbelievably strained story, but also because no one seems to fit into their role. And yes, this goes double for the star, Jackie Chan. Had he not been required to be anything more than a stuntman, then maybe (and I really do mean maybe) this film would have worked as an escapist family comedy. Alas, he also had to be a foil for three bratty kids as well as a romantic lead, and I don't think I can even begin to describe how unconvincing he is at both. He must have known there was a problem, because there are times when you can see on his face that he isn't having any fun. If it's difficult for him, imagine what it's like for the audience.

Chan plays Bob Ho, an undercover CIA agent who wants to retire and marry his next door neighbor, Gillian (Amber Valletta), having secretly dated her for some time. Bob assumes the role of the average guy next door by acting geeky and wearing glasses, which is fine if you like laughing at him, not with him. Gillian ... well, she's just Gillian, having no discernable personality or quirk that would make her even slightly interesting. The one scene of the two having dinner together is enough to make it clear that a union of any kind is inconceivable. There's absolutely no chemistry between them. Chan might as well have been speaking to Valletta in his native Cantonese - the effect would be more or less the same.

The problem for Bob is that Gillian is a single mom, and her children absolutely despise him. Farren (Madeline Carroll) is your typical moody teenager, always angry, always disrespectful, always referring to Gillian by her first name because she's technically her stepmother. There are moments when her attitude is so bad that you just want to slap her across the face. Ian (Will Shadley) is a super-smart, technically savvy, thrill-seeking middle-schooler who regularly lies in a desperate effort to be ""cool,"" especially with girls. There is not a trace of truth in this character; he doesn't even work as a parody of the precocious kid. The youngest is four-year-old Nora (Alina Foley), who's so cute that it's downright nauseating; she's a girly-girl who likes kitties and princess costumes and the color pink, and she can never speak without dropping her R's like Elmer Fudd.

When Gillian is called away from home, Bob volunteers to take care of her children, who, of course, do what they can to make his life a living hell. But then things turn sinister: Bob's last captive, a Russian terrorist named Poldark (Magnus Scheving), has escaped from prison and is plotting to evaporate the world's oil supplies with a special solution, the formula of which just happened to be downloaded from Bob's computer onto Ian's iPod. Yeah, I know. Anyway, as Bob tries to bond with Gillian's kids, he must also fight off scores of bad guys in a series of action sequences. Believe me, they're not as entertaining as the ads make them seem.

Helping Bob along are his former CIA partners Glaze (George Lopez) and Colton (Billy Ray Cyrus), the latter given dialogue that even Dr. Phil would think is hokey. Consider this helpful bit of advice for Bob: ""Don't get married. Just find some woman you're gonna hate in five years and give her your house."" Think about the demographic this film is aimed towards. Do you honestly think it will laugh at that joke? Then again, who's to say that adults will laugh at it? There were plenty of parents in the theater the day I saw it, and I didn't hear so much as a snicker from any of them. I didn't hear much out of the little ones either, although I distinctly remember a young girl, maybe around six years old, asking her father for a sip of his soda.

Someone should take this as a sign. What do we mean by subjecting younger audiences to this? Is Hollywood really so drained of imagination? There's such little creativity in ""The Spy Next Door,"" it's as if the filmmakers believe that today's kids are nothing more than mindless drones that will laugh at anything, even at things that are anything but funny. Consider this throwaway gag featuring the children's pet pig: At breakfast, Ian sneaks a few pieces of bacon under the table for the pig to eat, and it does. ""That's just wrong,"" observes Farren, which is correct, except that the scene plays as a lighthearted joke instead of a disturbing visual. There's nothing amusing about this, and the fact that the writers thought differently is downright deplorable.

In 2006, Jackie Chan apologized for interrupting a concert in Hong Kong while under the influence. If he knows what's good for him, he will apologize for making ""The Spy Next Door."" Since we pay in excess of $9.00 for a movie ticket these days, I think it's the least he can do for us.",1264377600,3,4913,4.634902411021814
4021121,5,B002ZG99MC,"This movie was pretty funny, the kids were cute, and the overarching themes of telling the truth and protecting your loved ones are great points of discussion with children.  For those that love Jackie Chan movies, you might be a little disappointed that there is not as much action in this movie and some of the stunts are obviously on wires.  But it is a movie for kids/families, so the level and excitement of the stunts seemed appropriate to me.  A few things I would want to be aware of as a parent before watching the movie with my child: 1)the female villain often shows a lot of cleavage 2)The 13 year old daughter seems to get away with being very disrespectful to the mom (though it is kind of explained a little later in the movie) 3)there is a little profanity 4)a college age young man hits on the 13 year old daughter (though Jackie doesn't let him get away with it) 5)the young boy in the movie boasts about watching pornography on pay-per view 6)he is also obsessed with getting older girls to show interest in him and receives some tips from Jackie on how to accomplish it.",1263686400,103,1090,4.44

4021476,2,B002ZG99MC,"Utterly mindless yet mildly entertaining family film about Jackie Chan as a spy, living in the suburbs, who implausibly is left in charge of babysitting three nuclear children. There's occasional martial arts involved but mostly it's just cheesy Disney channel-quality humor and gags. Seeing Magns Scheving as a non-Sportacus bad guy was interesting, and his over-the-top villain complemented the film well. It does tend to drag, and the family drama topics are cheesy and predictable. The gag reel at the end was a nice touch though.",1519430400,,534,5.22093023255814

I noticed each time an opponent got knocked out, he would flop a very little, letting you know he was alright and not ""dead"" but down for the count. This makes the film more kid-friendly than a lot of cartoons where opponents knocked out seem to be done for. I thought this showed a very nice level of consideration for kids, making this a low-violence action fight film. Cool moves edited at a pace that lets the children see what's going on, but engage them in the action of the movie. lots of humor. Lessons about who to value and how to carry oneself learned.",1518912000,,656,4.475

4023296,2,B002ZG99MC,"Let me start by saying that I've been a huge Jackie Chan fan for 25 years, longer than most Americans had any clue who he was.  I own most of his films (first on VHS, then VCD, then DVD).  He's made some really great movies.  His best--such as Wheels on Meals and Operation Condor--combine amazing martial arts, crazy stunts, and great comedy.  American studios have long tried to bring Jackie's runaway international stardom to bear on movies that American audiences, who generally won't watch foreign language films (even if dubbed into English), will go see.

Early in Jackie's career, Americans tried to bring him here and have him star in the kinds of low-budget violent movie you would more normally expect Steven Seagal or Chuck Norris to be in.  But Jackie is more comfortable in action comedies and those movies are his most popular in China, as well.  Unfortunately, Jackie doesn't speak English that well, so comedy embedded in dialogue is often lost due to his delivery.  Finally, in 1998, Brett Ratner paired Jackie with co-star Chris Tucker, successfully pairing both Chan's amazing action and stunt prowess with a US comic actor's timing and delivery.  Rush Hour finally made Jackie Chan a household name in the US.

The Spy Next Door is perhaps an attempt to introduce Jackie to American kids?  I don't know, but the movie doesn't apply even the successful formula of Rush Hour, let along the qualities of Jackie's best Chinese films.  It's a hodgepodge of genres for kids, and most of it falls flat.  The action is ho-hum because, I imagine, the movie is for children, but also because none of the other actors has the skill to go toe-to-toe with Jackie in way that's fun for audiences over the age of 10.  The movie has a few minor laughs, but Jackie's poor English can't deliver his best lines adequately.  It's also hard to imagine Gillian, played by Amber Valletta, being at all attracted to the older pen salesman (Jackie's character's cover identity), let alone believing that she would leave her 3 young children alone with him for an indefinite period of time.

Top it all off with terrible acting from Billy Ray Cyrus and George Lopez, and you get a movie that just didn't do anything for me.  I tried to get my kids, who are between 8 and 12, to watch, but they lost interest quickly.  I almost gave this 3 stars, but only because I like Jackie so much.  In the end, though, I had to be objective and give it 2 stars.",1489276800,3,2444,4.641860465116279
4023297,5,B002ZG99MC,Watched this on Amazon prime.  Jackie Chan is always very entertaining. This movie is no exception. I do not believe I heard a single  swear word in the whole movie.

The Spy Next Door is fun to watch, if for no other reason than to watch Jackie's amazing stunts (apparently he's been known to do them all himself).

In this movie, he is attempting to retire from the ""spy business"" and have a normal life with a woman and her children who dislike him, but circumstances beyond his control draw him back into this business.  This results in the woman he wants to marry and her children being put in danger and he does everything he can to protect them.  He had never told her that he was a spy, and when he did she became very angry.

4029136,3,B002ZG99MC,"This is a run of the mill, light hearted family action/comedy spy caper that is amusing at times. Pre-teens would probably enjoy it. Jackie Chan is getting a little old so he's not doing any outrageous stunts anymore, but he is still surprisingly nimble for his age. Aside from being a fairly bland movie, one thing that really stuck out like a sore thumb was the odd pairing of Jackie Chan and Amber Valletta. I know Hollywood loves to pair up old leading men with young leading ladies, so a 20 year age difference isn't uncommon between the lead actors in a movie, but this just didn't work. The whole relationship was more like a father-daughter relationship between the two. They would have been better off casting Virginia Madsen or some other more age appropriate actress and have her play a grandmother raising her grandkids after the tragic death of her daughter and son-in-law.",1485129600,,886,4.759740259740259

4034126,1,B002ZG99MC,"Certainly one of Chan's worse movies.  If you enjoyed Beethoven or the two live action Flintstone movies, you might enjoy this movie.  Chan is affable enough but the acting is strictly comic book with no foot in reality the way they relate to situations or each other.  There is also a huge lack of logic regarding Chan's character constantly releasing baddies he's bested so they can come back again -- totally against what (as we are told in the movie) an excellent spy would do.  Back to the characters and the acting in this movie:  They are not characters but rather ""types"".  If you can look past the shallow filmmaking here, there are fights and stunts that are well done (although by this time, Chan has to wear a wire when doing stunts and this shows by slowing descents enough to make them look very fake).  If you want to see Jackie Chan at his best, there are so many other of his movies worth your attention.  If you are looking for a time passer your children may enjoy, this would be a good movie for them.  For anyone else looking for a movie with a great or original storyline that has superlative fights and stunts as well as characters that are anywhere near three dimensional, then pass on this movie and only get it if you are a Chan completist as I am.",1418083200,6,1274,4.410256410256411

This vehicle was exhausted the first time it was used 50 years or so ago.  The writing is nowhere near as good as those dubious Disney one-week specials from the 70's, and it appears aimed at the same audience.  Even kids are too sophisticated for this waste of time.

He's always ready to make the crowd laugh, but when the time comes rest assured he'll show his martial art skills.

4035105,4,B002ZG99MC,"The Spy Next Door is one reason I love Jackie Chan movies. It combines the best human values, modern society and its semi-screwed up families, great humor, and an ending all pursuers of the American dream can be proud. That is the pursuit of happiness part. The ego of China might have gotten a boost by Chan's depiction of their intelligence and industry along with the defeat of Russia's best. The global big-dog got a few laughs at the expense of both. One question: What did the corrupt money-loving career head of the CIA and the country bumpkin sidekick say about America? Sell-outs for the highest dollar or good-ole boys?

If the technical issues had not occurred both when attempting to view movie and once later, I would have rated the Spy Next Door as a 5 star. I had to upgrade software, figure out how to by-pass the same message after it was upgraded, and wait several time for program to resume after disruptions.

4035157,5,B002ZG99MC,"We have two girls, ages 6 and 9.  They also happen to have been adopted from China, so we are always looking for kid-friendly movies that have good Asian role-model characters.

If you also have an adopted child, especially one from China, there are a couple of things you might want to know:

1) Late in the movie, Jackie Chan's character mentions that he grew up in an orphanage in China.  He adds that he never knew his birth parents, but that the other kids in the orphanage were his family, and they loved and looked out for each other.  The context is in trying to explain to the 13 year old girl that ""family isn't who you are related to by blood, but family is who you love"" (the girl isn't a full sister to the other siblings).  I don't think that is an exact quote, but that's the gist of it (I think he put it better).

2) Jackie's character sings a Chinese lullabye to the youngest child several times in the movie.  I know enough Mandarin to know it's real Chinese.  My girls LOVED that part!  And at the end (DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT A SPOILER), you have an inter-racial family (Asian and White).

I agree with another reviewer that the 13 year old got way too disrespectful with the mom, but that made for good discussion with our girls about what is and is not appropriate to say to your parents when you are angry.  (It's OK to be angry and to say so, but not OK to be rude and disrespectful.)

Overall I like this movie and we will get it for our collection.",1339545600,2,1480,4.224199288256227
4035158,4,B002ZG99MC,"This is an entertaining children's movie with an abundance of Disneyesque characters as villains, heroes, and comedic characters. The action is over the top but fun and if one can accept the assumptions one can have a light-hearted romp through spy adventure land at a child's level with plenty of sight gags to entertain even the youngest.

This is an enjoyable family movie for the entire family and should provide plenty of laughs all around.",1338249600,,445,4.933333333333334

Cartoon characters, horribly brattish children, awful acting, weak writing, and an overall feel that this was something Nickelodeon or ABC Family wouldn't even consider. Honestly....Jackie Chan in geek glasses playing straight man to freaking Billy Ray Cyrus? Oh, Jackie...

As far as entertainment for a family, do you really want your children watching these horrible, rude, disrespectful, sarcastic, and downright perverted children? Why would anyone find these brats amusing? You know what would've been truly funny? If they found some Jackie Chan, Jr. to kick their horrid little a$$es. I'd buy the movie if that was the case. The faint glimmer of hope that if I watched it until the end, I'd actually see some long overdue comeuppance for these children was the only reason I hung around. Seriously, there have got to be at least five things laying within immediate reach of you right now that are less wasteful of your time than this movie. This movie is so terrible that you'd be better off staring at a blank tv screen for ninety minutes than burning up time watching The Spy Next Door.

4035243,5,B002ZG99MC,"If you like Jackie Chan, you'll love The Spy Next Door.  While the story is different from the usual cops & robbers type movie the talented Mr. Chan stars in, this one is a very good family movie.  Jackie, known as ""Bob"" in the film, in love with his next door neighbor offers to look after her three children during her absence to visit an ailing relative.  The children are a 13 year-old girl, easily classified as a real brat during the first half of the story; a brilliant boy-child who has spent much of his young life as fodder for school bullies, and a precicious four-year-old girl who steals many of the scenes.  While the children's mother may in fact be in love with Jackie/Bob, the children loathe him, and the older girl and her brother, set out to torment him during his tenure as their babysitter.  The fact that Jackie/Bob is a spy is not known to either the children or their mother, the young ones consider him to be a real wuss.  As a good spy should, Jackie is able to devise some electronic gadgets to keep the children in line (for example, a gizmo that saves him from chasing the four-year-old by snaking out a line that latches onto her clothing, lifts her up, and delivers her back to her babysitter when she wanders off as she tends to do.  The rest of the film is fairly predictable.  There are the requisite ""bad guys,"" (Russians, of course), the growing affection between Jackie and the children, and the inevitable confrontation between the good and the bad.  And of course, there are plenty of gymnastics and stunts performed by our favorite humorous good guy.

All in all, this is a very enjoyable film with plenty of laughs and delightful characters.  You can also spend quite a bit of time wondering if ""Jackie really did that?"" or if what you're viewing is some sort of camera or computer trick.  Whether it is or not, this movie is definitely worth the price.",1323993600,5,1895,4.508771929824562
4035244,1,B002ZG99MC,"This movie failed on a number of levels.  First, from a Jackie Chan movie you expect at least some good martial arts scenes.  There were none here.  In fact, the fight scenes were rather boring.  The acting was terrible.  Sure, Chan is not first an actor but he has improved over time and is always at least passable.  When the main character's acting is passable it needs to be boosted by legitimate acting professionals.  So what did the producers do?  They get George Lopez and Billy Ray Cyrus to play besides Chan.  What a disaster they are.  The kid actors, well, you can't put too much blame on them but they were also hard to take.  Their lines were overdone.  I suppose they did the best they could.  When your own kids are laughing at the child actors, you know there's a problem.  Perhaps the worst part of the movie was the actors pretending to be Russians.  These people probably had the worst collection of Russian accents ever.  Some of this may be acceptable in a comedy, to a degree, but in this was it was just pathetic.  The plot was unimaginative and predictable: nerdy guy in love with beautiful divorcee with kids tries to get the kids to like him.  You can see almost every scene coming.  One major movie mistake: the setting is very California suburbia but Chan and his babe go out on a date to a street that I swear was in the 50's in Manhattan.

4035247,3,B002ZG99MC,"The Spy Next Door (2010) is something a little different for martial arts star Jackie Chan.  Intended as family entertainment, the action/comedy features Chan as Chinese secret agent Bob Ho on assignment in America, working with the CIA to try and apprehend Anton Poldark (Magnus Scheving), a Russian who has developed a substance that dissolves petroleum Russian.  Ho's real aspirations are to retire from the espionage business, get married, and try and live a normal life.  The tone is mostly light-hearted and fun, as Ho is involved in a romance with his neighbor Gillian (Amber Valetta), and has to somehow convince her three children that he is not a complete dork.

Bob takes charge over the three kids, Farren (Madeline Carroll), Ian (Will Shadley), and Nora (Alina Foley), when Gillian has to leave to care for her father.  Most of the humor revolves around Bob's attempts to handle the kids, and try and win their trust and affections.  While all are basically good kids, it's still an uphill struggle for a guy with minimal parenting skills.  Farren is a little rebellious, and doesn't feel like part of the family.  Ian is bright, but prone to exaggeration.  And Nora is just a cute little bundle of energy, that is almost too much to handle.

Life gets complicated, when Ian downloads a file containing Poldark's formula, using Bob's laptop.  Poldark dispatches a hit team led by Tatiana Creel (Katherine Boecher), to recover the file and kill whoever has it.  Bedlam ensues when the Russian's show up at Gillian's home.  Bob turns to CIA agents Glaze (George Lopez) and Colton James (Billy Ray Cyrus) for help, but finds that he is mostly on his own.  All roads lead back to Gillian's house, for a showdown with the Russians, on Halloween.

The Spy Next Door isn't hilariously funny, but is still probably entertaining family fare for those with younger children, and dedicated Jackie Chan fans.  Even after so many years, a language barrier still exists for Chan, but as is usually the case, his upbeat approach, good natured attitude, and still impressive athletic skills, does a lot to overcome his lack of verbal skills.  Although the role of family guy may not be one that we are used to seeing him play, Chan does pretty well working with young actors, particularly Alina Foley.  Besides the kids, the remaining supporting cast doesn't have that much to do, and character development is close to nil.  Better editing and scene transitions, would have helped things flow a little more smoothly, but the silly, uncomplicated, and clich filled story holds together fairly well, mixing incidents of domestic crisis, with a few mildly violent action scenes.",1308096000,,2672,4.937360178970917

Partly succumbing to some stereotypes, like the Chinese kung fu, while repudiating other stereotypes, like the Chinese man dating the American blonde, this movie is fun and funny to a limit.  Some of the gadgets are original, and some of the fight scenes are hilarious, like the part with the biting turtle.  But the overall movie is hokey as the different parts look like they were lifted from other movies.  The only original part of this film was the fact that it takes in place in the suburban Southwest, instead of the usual NY, Chicago, LA or San Francisco.

4035281,4,B002ZG99MC,"As a fan of PG-rated action films (Spy Kids, Cats & Dogs, etc.), there was no doubt that this was a movie I was going to see. It was a great movie, filled with action, adventure, and hilarious moments.

Secret agent Bob Ho wants to go into retirement so he can propose to his girlfriend Gillian and start a life being a husband and Dad to her three children Nora, Ian, and Farren. While the kids have their own problems trying to fit in at school and getting along as a family, they have one person they absolutely hate, Bob (there's an exception with Nora at times). When Gillian has to leave for a family emergency, Bob volunteers to watch her children. The kids cause plenty of trouble on their own (not including the cat, turtle, or pig).  Meanwhile, Anton Poldark, a Russian terrorist and the last villain Bob defeated while he was an agent, is on the loose again with a special substance that dissolves petroleum (not too mention he also wants revenge on Bob).  Bob takes the kids out of town to a hotel and reveals that he is a retired spy.  Much to the kids surprise, Farren later calls Gillian up and tells her, and she runs back home after Bob confirms over the phone that Farren was right. Gillian then breaks up with Bob and takes her kids home, and Bob returns to the agency. Later, he finds out from his assistant, Colton, that his collegue Glaze has sided with Poldark to help him with his plan. Then, Ian runs away from home with intentions to become a spy like Bob. He later finds Bob and is closely followed by Farren.  Of course, they are all captured by Poldark and his sidekicks. Ian then accidentally reveals that the code Poldark is after was mistakenly downloaded on his Ipod at home and Poldark sends his sidekicks to their house, threatening to kill Gillian and Nora. Bob and the kids later escape and race to Gillain's house, arriving right before the sidekicks do. Ultimately, Bob, Gillian, and the kids all happen to fight off the sidekicks and capture Poldark, with the police and Colt arriving to arrest them. Feeling guilty about ruining the family, Bob tearfully says good-bye to the family. The kids then plead for Bob to stay, Gillian agrees to marry Bob and they do, only to Bob saying that his name isn't actually Bob.

The action seen in this film is similar to other recent action titles, such as the later-seen Karate Kid remake and Race To Witch Mountain.  Family is the heart and center of this film as Bob tries to be a protective father-like figure for the kids, he is successful, winning over them in the end. The film also discusses Farren and her situation between families as her Dad is away and has a hard time getting along with her stepmother (Gillian). At the end she finally calls Gillian, ""Mom"", and realizes she is where she has wanted to be all along. Nora is an adorable four year old that is comparable to Michelle Tanner from Full House. She can be quite smart and more of a talker for her age. Ian is someone who has been picked on by bullies and later overcoming fears.

The film has a lot of funny parts, mostly the ones with the animal sidekicks though. However, more funny parts with the children are also prominent. Just like The Karate Kid, Jackie Chan shows more of his soft side in this film, and showed absolute sincerity throughout the entire 88 minutes of footage. A good film for families to rent and watch on the couch with a bowl of popcorn.",1297296000,,3415,4.470304975922954

And if you have a soft spot for silly, harmless, action films with a few laughs thrown in, then by all means, this film is okay.

4035376,3,B002ZG99MC,"Grading on two levels: THE SPY NEXT DOOR is harmless and sometimes entertaining as a family flick. The kids will probably eat this up. But if you're not a child and if you've seen Jackie Chan in his Hong Kong heyday, then you won't help but feel a full-on disappointment. This movie finds Jackie longer in the tooth, not quite as athletic or dazzling with the kung fu. And I think I see evidence of wire work. Jackie plays Bob Ho, a pen importer who resides in the 'burbs and dates Gillian (Amber Valetta), the cute divorced mom next door. Except that's just mostly a cover.

In real, Bob Ho is a Chinese secret agent on loan to the CIA. But because he's actually in love with his girlfriend, he decides to retire from espionage to concentrate more on his thing with Gillian. Thing is, Gillian's three hard-to-handle kids think he's an absolute spazz. When Bob ends up babysitting them, it's a golden opportunity for him to win them over. But then his spy gig comes back to haunt him, and Bob Ho must juggle bonding with the kids with facing off against his megalomaniac Russian nemesis. And because this is a comedy, the sneery Big Bad is also a bit of a clothes horse, except his minions who scrounge for his outfits don't exactly flip thru GQ magazines. The movie does throw a bone for the older viewers by way of a Russian spy woman dressed like a dominatrix, but that could merely be a nod towards cinematic conventions. Femme fatale spies are always well turned out in sleek kinky black leather.

If you've seen THE PACIFIER or MR. NANNY or KINDERGARTEN COP, you've more or less already seen this hackneyed plot and this comes off as another plateful of pandering. THE SPY NEXT DOOR offers nothing new, and the thing that cheeses me most is that a Rated PG Jackie Chan means that the martial arts violence gets toned down and we get even more chummy with the slapsticky elements (never Jackie's strongest point). And then Billy Ray Cyrus steps in with that weird hair thing he's got going on, and it's a struggle buying him as a CIA handler.

The kids who know Jackie from his cartoon show may like this one for all the goofy antics and the lightweight action sequences that grace the screen, plus Jackie very much retains that likable presence. But for those who marveled at his agility, daring stunts, and dazzling martial arts, what we get here is a shadow of the man and a misfire of a film rife with predictable plot points and tired sight gags. And sorry to say, Jackie Chan has zero chemistry with Amber Valetta. This being a Jackie Chan picture, I'd normally suggest sticking around for the closing credits outtakes, except that these outtakes aren't all that, that is if you're anticipating those traditional clips of Jackie's surviving his death-defying stunts. Jackie was 55 years old when he shot this flick. He may have had enough of getting his bones broken like kindling. At least now, maybe he can get insured when making a movie?

The DVD's bonus stuff: the ""Jackie Chan: Stunt Master & Mentor"" featurette (00:10:14 minutes); ""Adventures In Acting With The Kids of THE SPY NEXT DOOR"" (00:11:09) - this fun segment has Katherine Boecher (she plays the female villain ""Creel"" in the film) interviewing the kid actors; and, finally, the blooper reel, except this is the same stuff that rolled during the film's closing credits.",1284854400,,3347,4.639123102866779

I just saw the movie yesterday. And I agree with the reviews by Avid reader and Hammock rider. Just some slight differences here and there. I didn't worry about the cleveage, and I agree with Jonhny Lee's (comment on Avid reader's review) on that point (same in malls, supermarket etc), but the other points Avid reader mentions, certainly got me raising an eye brow for a short second while watching the movie (with kids). Thankfully these moments are I think just short enough to get the viewer quickly past them. Except maybe the older guy hitting on the 13 year old, was just a bit too long for my liking. But then again it may also be a good thing in making young teens awarre of these issues. Unfortunately it does happen in real life. And then this ""issue"" quickly dissapaited in the qucik action that follows as Bop Ho (main character) ""takes care"" of the situation that follows. And the viewer get a bit of that sense ""he got waht he deserved"". But I think it's good that Avid reader pointed out those points. Some parents may certainly appreciate.

""The Spy Next Door"" is a feel-good comedy flick for all ages.  I went into it not knowing what to think; the reviews I had read made it seem so juvenile.  On the contrary, it was a well-put-together movie and an overall enjoyable experience for both me and my wife.  The short of it is that Jackie plays a CIA agent who lives next door (in a CIA house) to a woman (Amber Valletta) that he is falling in love with and she with him.  She happens to be single with three children, two of which totally despise him for being such a geek--played adeptly by Chan with his ""geek"" glasses and batting eyelashes--and one, the youngest, who kind of likes him.  The relationship between Jackie and Amber cannot go any further until he can try to get the kids to accept him, and that's where the story begins.  They don't know he's a spy, and he doesn't want to be one anymore.

Someone else around here was complaining about wires being used instead of Jackie going full bore with his stunts and stunt team (Sing Ga Ban or Jackie Chan Stuntman Association). But look, the guy is pushing 60, and most of the ""wire"" stunts are done by other characters in the movie, not Jackie.  Come to think of it, I can only think of one particular instance where Jackie was obviously using wires.  Jackie can still perform stunts with the best of them.

I never thought I'd be a parent that would actually block channels, but yup, I've done that. Even Disney & Nick show some incredibly awful taste.

BTW, no movie today is worth the price of the ticket. We stick to rentals and the like...by the time we're done at the theatre with big family popcorn and one big soda, we've shelled out $50-$60 minimum.",1275782400,,1149,4.366197183098592

(1.) Tired, nothing original stunts - ladders, chairs, jumping on to or over things, stick (or any object in hand) fights. Unfortunately, it's getting really old and actually not very well done. Jackie's putting on some weight; out of shape and looks inflexible. Fortunately, there are some incredible arts films coming out of China the past 10 years but this one is an embarrassment.

(2.) Repeated, countless times, story of:
  (a.) Nerdy guy next door is super... something in real life.
  (b.) Divorced mom with dysfunctional young family - even down to cute clueless youngest girl, slightly older smart male, and older  social conscious female teen. Nerdy guy likes mom; needs to win over kids and seeks to do so by baby sitting them.
  (c.) Antagonistic Russian mob is after another fantasy tech product. In his super... role the nerdy neighbor guy intervenes. Of course the family next door  gets drawn in.
  (d.) Neighbor wins over family kids and marries their mom.

(3.) Jackie Chan has made a few of these knock-offs the past years. I wonder if he needs the money?",1275350400,2,1086,4.836956521739131
4035520,5,B002ZG99MC,"Gillian (Amber Valletta) has next a new potential love of her life; it is her next-door neighbor, the sedate pen salesman Bob Ho (Jackie Chan). However, their relationship is doomed as Gillian's children hold a low opinion of Bob. Gillian wants her kids to be safe and happy. What about Bob? He may not be as sedate as Gillian supposes but he intends to for her kids to like him. His opportunity comes when he gets to babysit. However, it looks like his old job may complicate things.

With few exceptions, I am not a Jackie Chan fan. This movie is definitely one of the exceptions.  It has over the top acting and stunts. The story is formula and predictable but this people can act and the dialog is hokey to match.  You will want to kibitz.

I have only seen the Blu-ray version. Be sure to look at the few DVD extras.",1275264000,3,821,4.34640522875817
4035521,4,B002ZG99MC,"I love Jackie Chan, regardless of what type of movie he stars in, so I buy everything I can find. I don't consider this movie one of his best, but it is very entertaining.  I was surprised at the end because he never, never did this before, as far as I know.  Kids will probably like this movie more than adults, but if you're already a fan, add this to your collection.",1275177600,,370,4.125
4035522,5,B002ZG99MC,"Good natured Spy vs. Kids action flick is a low-cal twinkie even by family film standards. The critics liked to play rough with it; and if you feel snooty about it, better stay away. Cute is its stock in trade and there are no disappointments if expectations remain logical: PG Jackie Chan suburban domestic comedy with mild action. Wacky Russian mobsters and their dominatrix-babe leader wear leathers and generally show bad taste as the foil in the spy plot, which follows Jackie home to his family to be.
Good for kids or adults like me who need a balance from the heavy stuff.
Blu-ray makes the grade for sight and sound.",1274572800,11,625,4.63963963963964
4035523,5,B002ZG99MC,Saw this film in the cineplex. It was a lot of fun and I would recommend it for family viewing and for adults who want to watch a feel-good movie. It was just the type of fun flic I needed to watch at the time and I enjoyed it immensely. We all need to laugh more and not take the world so seriously. George Lopez and Billy Ray Cyrus added to the fun.,1270771200,,351,3.8219178082191783
4035524,4,B002ZG99MC,"I thought this was a really good movie. It reminded me of a mix between Mr. Nanny, Secret Agent Club, and The Pacafier. Jackie Chan stars as a spy named Bob Ho. Bob is dating his next-door neighbor Gillian who has three kids that don't like Bob, because they think he is incredibly boring. When Gillian has to leave town in order to care for her injured dad, so Bob feels that it's the perfect opportunity to get the kids to like him. Meanwhile, Bob's enemy Poldark escapes from jail and tries to find him. As soon as the kids realize who Bob really is; they begin to like him and decide to help stop Poldark. Another thing I loved was that this movie takes place around Halloween. I highly recommend THE SPY NEXT DOOR!!!",1270339200,,721,4.348148148148148

The spy next door is about a babysitter that gets a mother's family in big trouble. There was a fight between the mean people and the babysitter. Find out why they are fighting!

My favorite part is when the babysitter starts to beat up the mean guys. The mean guys just sit there. I was laughing so hard that I spit popcorn out of my mouth on the floor.

If you are looking for an action-packed movie, you should try the spy next door. It will make you laugh so hard you will pee your pants! You will find it at your local movie store.",1269388800,,547,4.093457943925234
