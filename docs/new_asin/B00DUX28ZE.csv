5856954,5,B00DUX28ZE,"Thoroughly enjoyed the history of forensics impacted by Sherlock tales.  They also directly impacted Courtroom procedures regarding evidence.  Recommend viewing, especially by attorneys and law students ... prosecutors and defense.",1390521600,2,231,6.666666666666667
5856955,5,B00DUX28ZE,"I found the show on PBS strictly by accident today.  I have been reading Sherlock stories since age 10 and own every Sherlock Holmes book I've ever seen (some of them twice!).  One of my favorite Christmas gifts was a set published in the early 1900's.
As I watched the show I realized how much he influenced my way of looking at things...no, I am not a detective of any kind, but I do analyze in ways that are singularly ""Holmesian"" - to the point that several boyfriends have asked if I were a private eye.  They seemed to take offense at things I noticed about their apartments or behavior!
I cannot believe that someone complained about the actor and the wardrobe!  Of course, I am old enough to have Basil Rathbone as the image in my mind of what Holmes ""looks like"" - Peter Cushing also fit the description invented by Doyle...but so many actors have held the role that I am able to get beyond the looks and listen to the words...
I loved that the various forensics professionals  kept referencing the Holmes ideas that led to today's innovations.  Fascinating!",1390089600,6,1067,4.53125
5856956,3,B00DUX28ZE,"We enjoyed the movie for the most part.  I learned a few new things so that was great.  But, the person they had playing Sherlock was a total turnoff.  He was more on the fair haired side and more on the fair at best acting side too.  For us the man portraying Sherlock was a turnoff.  That and they constantly had Sherlock wearing the deerstalker hat.  BOOOO.  I think it is only twice that Sherlock worse a hat described as being able to come down over the ears (never calling it a deerstalker hat) but no one including Sherlock would wear this hat around the city. Strictly a country hat.  All said and done we would not bother with this DVD again.",1389225600,2,651,4.278688524590164
5856957,4,B00DUX28ZE,"Contrary to the rather histrionic 1 star review left for this item, this show was actually interesting to watch. To be sure, Holmes was not the FIRST fictional detective to use some of the forensic techniques which are commonplace today, but it can be said the fictional adventures of Holmes popularized many of these techniques. Also, to be fair, it wasn't the program itself that was making some of the claims about Holmes but many of the guests interviewed did so.

Several forensic investigators are interviewed, including Henry Lee, one of the most prominent forensic scientists in the world. They talk about the method Holmes used and how they have come down to us today and are used now. They also talk of the personal impact of the Holmes stories on their own careers. There are some snippets of Holmes' cases dramatized. Also a look is given at the latest iteration of Holmes played by Benedict Cumberbatch. There is even some footage of an interview given by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle filmed in the 1930's, I think. I wasn't aware such footage existed, so that was a treat to watch. A quick look is also given at Joseph Bell, Doyle's mentor and one of the inspirations for Holmes, and a look is given at Doyle's own forays into crime solving.

All in all, I thought it a well put together program, worth a look if you're interested in Sherlock Holmes and/or in forensic science.",1388016000,19,1385,4.672131147540983
5856958,1,B00DUX28ZE,"OMG! Did anyone check facts before putting out this ""documentary""? Despite what this series says, Holmes WAS NOT the first fictional detective to pioneer forensic science-based techniques. Edgar Allan Poe's character of Le Chevalier C. Auguste Dupin, the fictional detective from Poe's ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue"" used these techniques and logical reasoning to solve crimes years before Doyle published stories with Holmes. This TV show is just pigging back off of the acclaim of recent Sherlock Holmes adaptations--but not in a way that sheds honest, accurate light on the role of literature in the development of criminology and forensic science. Claptrap alert!",1387584000,4,668,5.4326923076923075
5856959,5,B00DUX28ZE,"As a 40 year criminal investigator and instructor in investigations and the use of the forensic science I watched with facination the best summary of the origin of modern technics I have seen to date.  I learned the origin of things I have been involved with and doing.  There were a few things that I want to research to see if they are completely accurate, but overall this is an outstanding presentation.  It identifies and credits true pioneers like, Gross, Locard, Kirk and others along with more modern practitioners such as Lee and Rieders.  I plan to use this as part of my college criminal investigations class.",1387324800,16,620,4.766355140186916

My 7th graders for the most part loved it...and trust me, it is tough to get them to sit through informational films. This included detectives, crime scene investigators, forensics team members, and others to tell the story of how Sir Arthur C.

5856975,5,B00DUX28ZE,"A fan of anything Sherlock I found this documentary of Conan Doyle's impact on current forensic science very interesting.  My friend wrote a thesis on Conan Doyle which I never read as she did it before I was particularly interested having read most Sherlocks when I was in Jr. High and therefore thought them childish.  I got back to rereading about 20 years later and found them as interesting as I found them as an early teen.  Some stuff ""lives"".",1417305600,,450,4.6

If Sir Arthur Conan Doyle just wrote about how to do crime scene investigation I don't think it would have attracted many people, but using his genius he put it into story format and it took on a whole new meaning.

It has experts in many fields of forensics presenting their arguments on how Sherlock (or Conan Doyle) had come up with the ideas for what turned out to be their areas of expertise. Many of them give credit to the stories for inciting their interest in the field of forensics and so for their jobs.

5857005,4,B00DUX28ZE,"In the form of a documentary we are shown how one of our favorite sleuths inspired forensic crime detection in movies and real life.

The narrator, Andrew Lincoln, carries us through a soundbite series of actual people that were influenced by the techniques. I would like to have seen one presenter follow their though all the way through than having the attention span of ADHD jumping back and forth through the same handful of experts.

The program slows down to show some of the more common (or uncommon for the time) methods used to solve crimes that are not what they look like and free the innocent.

Of course others may point out that Sherlock Holmes may not have been the first, but he comes to mind first. We also get to learn a little bit about the author of the stories Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and how he practiced what he preached.

The one glaring drawback in the presentation is the lack of motive in each scenario. I am not a big motive fan; however it is glaringly absent.",1406592000,,988,4.472222222222222
5857006,5,B00DUX28ZE,"Excellent program.  As with some of the other reviewers, I have always been a Sherlock Holmes fan, having read and watched the stories (Jeremy  Brett and Benedict Cumberbatch being my favorites).

""Sherlock Holmes, the first CSI, continues to inspire detectives on TV and at the movies.  He is as popular as ever.  But his lasting legacy is that, even today, he continues to solve crimes.""

The above is said by the narrator at the end of this spectacularly interesting documentary that blends real-life forensic analysis with Sherlockian forensic analysis.

I learned quite a bit from this documentary, not only about forensics but about Sherlock Holmes (and his alter ego, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, 1859 to 1930).

Using a combination of interviews (with forensic scientists, crime historians, Sherlock Holmes' experts, etc.), dramatic recreations, and archival footage (some in black and white), this documentary explains the impact and legacy of the most famous fictional crime fighter in history.

Here are some of the chapters found in this documentary:

(1) Jack the Ripper
(2) Deductive reasoning
(3) Blood evidence
(4) Bullets and ballistics
(5) The science of poisoning
(6) Fingerprints and fakes
(7) The art of tracing footsteps

Finally, what I especially liked about this documentary is the use of real high-profile murder cases with footage of the real crime scenes.

In conclusion, not only is this an instructional documentary on forensics, it is an entertaining one as well.  I leave you with this piece of wisdom from Sherlock Holmes:

""Once you've excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.""
