3518009,4,B001CTDH58,"""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" will, I think, wow most kids, dog-lovers and those interested in a mildly diverting flick. It's short but seems long. The dogs talk but need better writers. A frequent visitor to Mexico, I was never as confused by Mexican geography as I was during this film. It kept introducing new plot devices and characters. A rat and an iguana pop up as do a whole army of Chihuahuas. I never realized there were so many varieties of them.
 At times the movie is cutesy, at others seeming to be about character-building. It's not violent. All of the dogs except one appear to be nice guys, uh, canines. If your kids ask you why your dogs can't talk, tell them the cat's got their tongue.",1224892800,,701,4.519685039370079
3518010,4,B001CTDH58,"My family members and I are making a movie called 'Pumpkin Man' (which I based my user name on.) On our free time My aunt, grandma and I went to see this. I thought this was very good and very funny! It's weird because my dad's sister's husband's mom has a chihuahua named Chloe, but she's had the name 6 years before this came out. After a spoiled rich Chihuahua becomes lost in Mexico, she has help from Delgado by trying to get back to Beverly Hills. Along the way, she figures out more about herself. If you love comedy and dogs, you'll love BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA!!!",1224633600,,572,4.355140186915888
3518011,5,B001CTDH58,"Bring your kids, you parents, your grandparents even that movie snob who sees only indie flicks. This movie is a sheer delight from the first frame to the last.  Walt Disney merely confirms that it has the magic touch in creating a delightful movie that should appeal to every age level.

You've not only got adorable talking dogs, but you've got lavish locations, great music, and a story line that keeps you constantly guessing and hoping for the fate of the main star: Chloe, the white, trembling, starry-eyed chihuahua. Some have questioned the logic of the plot--which traces the adventures of Chloe after she becomes lost in Mexico. This movie should be appreciated for what it is: a fluffy fantasy about the secret lives of dogs.

Disney Studios have given this movie a plush, A plus production, with delightful performances from everyone--and that includes animals and humans.

This is a movie that's attracting people back to see it every weekend--much like the phenomenal success of MAMA MIA.

Bravo to Chloe, the chihuahua--and the rest of this delightful cast.dogs,",1224288000,3,1077,5.02808988764045
3518012,5,B001CTDH58,"This is a wonderful story about friendship, loyalty and knowing where you come from. It is for everyone of different ages. Chloe is a spoiled chihuahua who gets accidently lost in Mexico and goes on a adventure to try and get back home to Beverly Hills. Through this journey she realizes that all she knew about her life goes beyond. Then there is Papi the romantic chihuahua that loves her and that will do anything for her. At the end Chloe realizes what is really important in her life. And is not the spoiled dog she used to be..... It's a story that teaches a lesson which makes it even more special. GREAT MOVIE FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY!!!",1224028800,16,642,4.4491525423728815
3518013,4,B001CTDH58,"Even with all the hype and not expecting a good film, Beverly Hills Chihuahua is wonderful, delightful and funny.  I call it a modern day Lady and The Tramp.  After reading one review on Amazon about how sad, implausible, etc..I wondered what the viewer really wanted and that maybe he/she had been damaged earlier in life by sweet, dog loving, sad but good ending movies.
It's a dog lovers movie and a very good kids movie with plenty of ""life lessons"".....just like all Disney dog movies.  Hooray for Disney.  How else would little children learn about dogs and love and life and loyalty.  Animation (dogs talking) done very, very well.  I'm 59 years old and I've not seen a sweeter movie in years.",1224028800,29,700,4.650406504065041
3518014,3,B001CTDH58,"Why is it that movies about animals are inherently depressing? When did an animal's harm and/or death become so much more unendurable than a human's? It probably stems back to the final scenes of ""Old Yeller,"" when Travis' mother wants to put the rabid dog out of his misery by shooting him. As the audience starts bawling, Travis grabs hold of the gun: ""No, Mama. He was my dog. I'll do it."" No such scene exists in ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua,"" thank God, but the idea of an adorable dog getting lost far away from home is still pretty heart-wrenching, especially for the younger audiences this movie was made for. Adults will probably know right off the bat that everything will be all right, just as they will probably realize that the filmmakers did not have them in mind (I should know--I'm an adult). ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" is a lot like a stray dog: It's cute but also a little mean, and not too many people will have the wherewithal to take it in.

If the sight of lapdogs wearing needlessly expensive clothing disgusts you, as it does me, then the beginning of this movie is not for you. It takes place in Beverly Hills, where it seems that the richest people over-pamper their pets. Toy dogs--like poodles, pugs, Yorkshire terriers, and Chihuahuas--are carried in designer bags to doggie spas, where they're fed prime rib and bottled water as they're being groomed. One dog has sections of its hair folded in strips of aluminum foil. Highlights are so becoming on a dog, wouldn't you agree? A few of them walk on miniature treadmills, because goodness knows a dog can't get enough exercise running through a park. Living in the midst of this extravagance is a Chihuahua named Chloe, a live action dog with a computer-generated mouth (voiced by Drew Barrymore). Her wealthy owner, Vivian (Jamie Lee Curtis), operates a cosmetics company.

When Vivian is called away to Capri on business, she asks her niece, Rachel (Piper Perabo), to watch Chloe for her. Rachel makes it clear to her friends that she doesn't care much for her aunt's dog; she's spoiled and manipulative. Likewise, Chloe isn't too fond of Rachel, and she tells this to all her dog friends as they lounge by the pool on their own floating lounge; Rachel, in her eyes, is mean and irresponsible.

Hoping to have some fun while Vivian is away, Rachel and her friends drive into Mexico for a mini vacation (one look at her aunt's gigantic mansion is enough to make the idea seem silly). Chloe is forced to go with them since, apparently, no one else in Beverly Hills is available to watch a dog. Once they arrive, Chloe is kidnapped by Vasquez (Jos Mara Yazpik), a vile man who operates an underground dogfighting ring in Mexico City. The idea that a kid's movie would make light of something so reprehensible is appalling; the filmmakers show numerous shots of dogs trapped in cages, and yet they handle those moments innocently, almost playfully. The dog pound scene in ""Lady and the Tramp"" was more serious than this, even with the inclusion of a musical number. Chloe escapes with the help of a German shepherd named Delgado (voiced by Andy Garcia), who was once a police dog but let go when he psychosomatically lost his sense of smell. Once Vasquez realizes how important Chloe is, he relies on his vicious Rottweiler, Diablo (voiced by Edward James Olmos), to retrieve her.

As Chloe and Delgado travel through Mexico, Rachel begins a frantic search effort. At her side are Vivian's landscaper, Sam Cortez (Manolo Cardona), and his pet Chihuahua, Papi (voiced by George Lopez), who loves Chloe with all his heart. Contrary to what the ads for this movie claim, Papi is not the main character. He's barely a supporting character, which is just as well seeing as he's probably the least interesting. All he does is love Chloe blindly and say witty things like, ""Hold your tacos!"" and ""Let's go kick some tail!"" The most interesting side character is Manuel (voiced by Cheech Marin), a rat who gets by as a con artist with an iguana named Chico (voiced by Paul Rodriguez). One of the reasons he's the most interesting is because he's also the least logical; he wants to steal Chloe's collar because it's covered with diamonds. One wonders: As a rat, how does he hope to cash in on the collar? Are we to assume there are underground rat organizations with secret stashes of money? Even if there are, how does Manuel plan on spending his money? Are there upscale stores I'm not aware of with an interspecies clientele?

""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" gets less and less plausible as it nears its end, not helped by the fact that the settings become too exotic. At one point, Chloe and Delgado meet a tribe of Chihuahuas living in a long-since abandoned Mesoamerican temple city. Are we really supposed to believe that such a thing would be possible, even within the context of a kid's movie? And why on earth did Plcido Domingo, one third of the Three Tenors, agree to voice the leader of the Chihuahuas? A man of such prestige deserves better than a below-average family film. I can say the same thing for pretty much all the actors. ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" is not the charming comedy it wanted to be--it's jokey, broad, and even at its most sterile, there are moments when it's very sad. Films with animal casts can have that effect, which makes me wonder why we still make them.",1223337600,4,5352,4.701492537313433
3518015,5,B001CTDH58,"Being the chihuahua lover that I am, I was first in line at our local cinema to see this flick!

I loved it from begining to end, however it wanst exactly what I expected.  From some of the previews it looked like there would be lots more chihuahuas in most of the film, but for the most part it is two chis (Chole and Papi) along with a German Shepard.  Towards the end is about 5-7 mintues of films with LOTS of chihuahuas, include a bit of history about the breed, some pretty cool looking aztec ruins, and chis of every shape and color, including brindles, blue, chocolates, blacks, merles, spotted, fawn and even long coats!

Has great themes about finding your roots, not giving up on your true friends and helping others when they need it the most.  Also, that no matter what your situtation is, there is a place where you belong.

I went with a friend from work (we are both adults) and we both loved it.  We laughed and cried, and agreed we will see it again and buy it when it comes to video!

Also, kudos to Disney.  At the end of this film there is a note about how each  pets deserves a permenant loving home, and if you purchase a dog, to do research on the breed!",1222992000,51,1178,4.21875
3518016,4,B001CTDH58,"Cosmetics entrepreneur Vivian Ashe (Jamie Lee Curtis) lives a lavished lifestyle.  She makes sure her Chihuahua Chloe (voice of Drew Barrymore) lives that same lifestyle with designer doggy outfits and diamond encrusted collars.  But, business calls for Viv to go overseas and unfortunately that means Chloe has to stay behind with Vivian's somewhat irresponsible niece Rachel (Piper Perabo).  Rachel decides to take a trip of her own, to Mexico, and Chloe gets dragged along.  A rather unfortunate ""dog knapping"" leads to a series of unfortunate events and the long way home with some comedic twists thrown in.

""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" is an updated version of ""Homeward Bound"" with a Mexican twist.  It also has a bit of canine cop and a doggy love story thrown in.  The humor can be aimed at an adult audience (depending how you interpret some scenes), but overall the laughter is kid friendly.  Also to take note, the film contains some child oriented themes...don't give up on yourself and keep your promises.

""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" is a fun movie to be enjoyed by all, especially those who fancy their dogs in attire.  Cute pooches and plenty of laughter make this a good family fun movie.",1222992000,4,1201,4.96

3518061,4,B001CTDH58,"What stands out more than anything to me in this film isn't visual, but audible: the voice of George Lopez, a racist stand-up comedian I can't stand, who plays a dog named Papi.  Cheech Marin also provides a voice, for another dog, named Manuel.  James Edward Olmos provides the voice of the antagonist, a big, mean dog renowned as El Diablo, Spanish for ""The Devil.""

If you enjoy listening to Cheech Marin's thick Hispanic accent, and Hispanic accents in general, this film is an auditory festival.  If you've lived in southern California for five years, and are tired of hearing Hispanic accents, you might find this film very nauseating.

If you love dog fighting, this takes you to a Mexico where it's acceptable.  If you think Michael Vick should have been executed for profiting from this animal sport, you might find this film nauseating.

The reason I'm giving this film four stars is because my wife enjoyed watching it so much, since it had so many cute dogs, especially Chihuahuas, in it.  Even the dog fighting scenes included enough humor to make them palatable; imagine Drew Barrymore in a Chuhuahua's body, thrown into a pit with the wolf who ate Red Riding Hood's grandmother.  But I recommend watching this film with the volume turned all the way down.

I did a lot of research on both breeds and really liked them both-so was having a little difficulty in making up my mind.
As I was going through the channels I saw that the Disney channel would be showing this movie that evening.
 So of course, I watched it. My mind was made up-it was a chi for me!
A few days later I adopted an absolutely beautiful 3.b lb. 4 month old chi named Minuette!
But I do have to add that the little yorkie in the movie (Biminy) was adorable!",1458691200,2,550,4.045871559633028

3518380,5,B001CTDH58,"I will preface this by saying, I love Chihuahuas. Never thought I'd say that, but I recently adopted and older rescue dog, and she has been wonderful. So now I'm on a Chihuahua kick and love all things Chihuahua.

I enjoyed the film and watched it twice. Even though there are some stereotypes (the Mexican gardener, the poor little rich girl), I actually thought the film is cute.  Chloe is a rich little Chihuahua from Beverly Hills who is taken to Mexico on vacation by her rich owner's niece. While she is Mexico she becomes lost and befriends a dog-fighting German shepherd who helps her out.  She learns a lot, but ultimately must be rescued from dognappers by the male dog Papi.

There are some silly bits, like the Chihuahua rebellion and some of the rat/lizard antics, but nothing that I felt was over the top or had me reaching for the remote.

Oddly, the only character I didn't like was Papi. I thought that he was an odd looking Chihuahua and the romance and his voice acting was too stereotyped.

This was a cute film though. I liked Chloe a lot. Yes I ordered the sequel.",1361145600,,1086,4.4873096446700504

We wanted something like that for our little guys and since one of mine LOVES Chihuahuas (odd I know) we opted to watch this for our family movie night.
It was actually quite entertaining and well done. A good family flick. Silly story, cute talking dogs.

3518498,3,B001CTDH58,"Trying to complain about Disney's obsession with movies about talking animals is self-defeating.  Like taxes, they will never go away, and we'll see more them in the future.  As long as kids eat this stuff up, there's an audience for this cheap marketing scheme.  This might sound like I'm already hating ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"", but I can't for the life of me say it's awful.  It's just another silly talking animals movie, but at least no one's singing for its own sake or people throwing arms at verbally-understood creatures like hypnotized drones since the dogs and humans are in their own communicative world.  Already, the movie's a step up from ""The Country Bears"".

Chloe is a selfish, materialistic spoiled chihuahua raised by a rich Jamie Lee Curtis.  While the dog's under the care of a babysitter (the barkeep/diver from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coyote/dp/B0000524E5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coyote</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cave/dp/B000BUNZY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cave</a>""), the neglectful babysitter and her friends go off to Mexico, where Chloe will eventually be dognapped by a crime lord who controls the dog fights.  She escaped with her allies, and while she tried to head home, she learned about the flaws of her character, realized what's important and all that typical Disney schlock.  Even she eventually gets better, I just can't stand this dog: not because of how self-absorbed and demeaning she is, but how obnoxiously chatty she is.  Always has to worry about what she wears, often making sly comebacks, and frequently pointing out the needs of her rich style.  She's the benefactor of my disdain for animal chatter.

Delgado, on the other hand, is an upside to the verbal animals concept; he's the main protector Chloe met before she escaped with him from the villain's hideout.  Cool name aside, he's not much of a chatterbox, can't tolerate Chloe's high-strung behavior, reliable, and takes a direct approach to everything.  I actually like tha dog, since I can sorta identify with him in a non-species manner. Too bad, much like every other combative stray in many romantic films, he has to grow all caring about Chloe even though he shouldn't; at least he didn't fall for her, but he still worries for her.  As you can see, talking animals has never been annoying because of the concept of talking; it's how much they talk and the attitude they have when they speak that can be damaging.  For Delgado, he's a tolerate exception.

The movie was fine enough with just dogs with obvious CGI lip-synching, then it had to bring in the rat and iguana.  I never liked them, because they represent they are bad habit of Disney.  Because it's a requirement for Disney movies to have a comic relief (and the George Lopez-voiced Chihuahua doesn't seem to be good enough, apparently), there has to be two bumbling thieves to crack jokes and cause chaos.  That's just peachy, an obviously CGI rat and reptile doing forced laughs to bug me.  But the movie does have other interesting characters.  It does surprise me that the main human antagonist, in a movie about dogs talking in puns and accents, actually appears threatening and not a corny villain desperate for laughs (I'm looking at you, clown from ""Air Bud""), and the nefarious doberman named El Diablo ain't that corny either (though I wonder why dobermans always have to be bad guys).

What else can I say? It is what it is, nothing to get enraged about.  ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" has a story that plays it straight: it's a dog who lost his way, facing challenges and peril in an exotic scenery.  Is it really best Chihuahua movie ever made?  Close, but it sure didn't beat&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oliver-and-Company/dp/B001ILFUD2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Oliver and Company""</a>; sure, that movie is about a cat, but it does have a chihuahua playing a racist stereotype.",1278288000,,4015,5.333333333333333

3518501,5,B001CTDH58,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Before seeing 'Beverly Hills Chihuahua' I was expecting a completely insipid comedy strictly for ten year old's. Boy was I wrong. 'Chihuahua' is one of the best comedies I've seen in the last few years. It's got an 'A' story with a cast full of talking dogs and a 'B' story consisting of a supporting cast of humans. The star is 'Chloe', the cutest little Chihuahua you'll ever meet, expertly voiced by Drew Barrymore. Chloe is a prissy, pampered Beverly Hills doggie diva owned by a highly successful cosmetics CEO, 'Aunt Viv' (played by a still good-looking Jamie Lee Curtis). Aunt Viv's only sin is that she indulges her precious Chloe but is basically a very good person. That's evidenced by her warm treatment of the newly hired Hispanic landscaper, Sam (warmly played by Colombian actor, Manolo Cardona). Sam's Chihuahua, Papi (hilariously voiced by George Lopez) falls in love with Chloe and later figures in her rescue.

Chloe's counterpart is Viv's niece, Rachel, who also needs to learn a few life's lessons by not talking down to people (Rachel assumes that the 'lowly gardener' Sam, can only speak Spanish). Meanwhile Chloe's uppity attitude is exposed from the very beginning. She's ""born to shop, not fight""--and proudly proclaims she's an heiress; only to be met by one of her buddy's retorts: ""a hairless"". Chloe objects: ""Not a hairless...I have a trust fund."" When Aunt Viv has to fly to Italy on a business trip, she leaves Chloe in Rachel's charge. Disaster strikes when Rachel impulsively drives down to Mexico with some of her friends and Chloe ends up getting 'dog napped' by criminals who hold dog fights in Mexico City. The head of the dog nappers is the nasty Vasquez who has an evil Doberman, El Diablo, (menacingly voiced by Ed James Olmos), who all the other dogs fear.

Despite all her spunk, Chloe manages to remain out of touch even when she finds herself in the middle of a dog ring about to be chomped on by El Diablo. First off, she mistakes the applause of the seedy crowd as approval when in fact they're laughing at her, expecting her imminent demise. Chloe has some great lines though, inside the ring (""Clearly I'm not in the right place--call the concierge""; along with telling El Diablo that she knows a great dentist in Beverly Hills who can clean up his yellow teeth!). Chloe is saved by a former police dog, Delgado, a gutsy, world weary German Shepherd voiced by a perfect, gravely voiced Andy Garcia. I was in stitches when Delgado dumps Chloe in the muddy puddle of water and proclaims Delgado has got her scent--and she replies ""Of course he does, it's Chanel #5"".

Rachel realizes the big mistake she's made and leaves her friends to find Chloe. There's a very funny scene when she gets a call from Aunt Viv at the police station and she has to pretend she's Chloe barking into the phone. Meanwhile, Chloe, now all muddied up, returns to her hotel and gets a taste of her own medicine: a bunch of snobby poodles want the horrible mutt immediately evicted from the premises. Chloe stares in horror at herself in the mirror and exclaims: ""I'm hideous"". Now she's beginning to realize that she's not so special.

When Rachel meets up with Sam at the police station, the police only have limited information on the dog ring's whereabouts. Sam wants to wait for more information, but Rachel insists on continuing the search for Chloe on their own. Papi states he's with Rachel and utters the film's #1 iconic line: ""We're Mexican, not Mexican't"". Soon Chloe discovers the ever so cute con men, Rat and Iguana, and I almost fell out of my chair laughing when Chloe observes them fighting and exclaims: ""This is just like Animal Planet""!!! Then when El Diablo confronts the rat after he pilfers Chloe's diamond collar, the rat has that great line: ""Please don't eat me, I've got a wife and 300 kids to feed.""

Wouldn't you know it but coyotes smuggle the dogs over the border! Eventually, Chloe and Delgado find themselves in the desert where Delgado reveals his dark secret: he's lost his sense of smell. Then our doggie heroes have their 'dark moment' when a bunch of mountain lions are about to have them for lunch. The film is just full of so many incredible surprises--there's a sandstorm, kicked up by a pack of Chihuahuas, led by the mighty Montezuma (aka Monte). It's Monte who gives Chloe a dose of 'Chihauhua pride' and the film's loftiest moment is when the Chihuahuas loudly proclaim: ""No mas, no mas!"" Rachel still needs to learn a lesson when she and Sam come upon some strays and she says with disdain: ""Just what we need--stray dogs""; and it's Sam who wisely points out: ""Papi was a stray dog"".

Things are neatly wrapped up when Chloe and Delgado aid in their own rescue by gaining the attention of a couple of Mexican Park Rangers. Soon, the evil Vasquez appears on the scene and snatches Chloe again (he's figured out that Chloe's owner is worth a lot of money). Delgado's arc is complete when he regains his sense of smell and leads the police to Vasquez, saving Chloe in the process.

Both Chloe and Rachel have improved their lives after their great adventure. And they're both rewarded with true love along with their respective honeys (Papi and Sam). The further reward is that they get home just in time to prevent Aunt Viv from learning of Rachel's big faux pas.

I don't know how Disney does it, but the direction of man's best friends in this film is superlative (undoubtedly some computer enhancement helped things along). 'Chihuahua' is not only funny but it's touching due to the underlying message of tolerance it so successfully conveys.",1272844800,3,5655,4.721377912867275

3518556,3,B001CTDH58,"Disney's ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" is based on one time-tested formula of a classic story about a faithful pet coming back to the owner, and other animals walking and talking and occasionally saying something stupid - like Scooby-Doo. It night be helpful for you to know that ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" is directed by Raja Gosnell, who did two live-action ""Scooby-Doo"" films recently.

The opening of ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" is weak, but later it gets better. In a very contrived setup, Chloe (voiced by Drew Barrymore), a Chihuahua too accustomed to luxurious lifestyle (provided by her rich owner Viv, played by Jamie Lee Curtis) gets lost in Mexico. With a help from a lonely German Shepherd with a past (voiced by Andy Garcia) Chloe tries to travel back to LA, but their journey, as it turns out, are full of adventures and challenges.

This is a Disney innocuous comic adventure movie. Most probably Chloe's fate would have been so much worse in real life (a Chihuahua in a dog fight?), but the film is made for entertainment and maybe we should keep that in mind. Still, some characters (humans especially) are just impossible. Piper Perabo plays Viv's niece Rachel, who is so careless and irresponsible at first. Then, after 15 minutes or so, she becomes a completely different person (with different makeup), looking for her aunt's missing Chihuahua. In the film dogs and other animals are better actors than humans for the most of the scenes. In fact, actions involving animals are well-done against the nice backdrop of Mexico.

I myself find the film is not so bad as some reviewers claim though it is nothing original either (except one scene where you can see a pack of mighty Chihuahuas) .It is a blend of the famous story ""Lassie Come Home"" (or ""The Incredible Journey) and a titular ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua.""

3518695,5,B001CTDH58,"When I saw the trailer for Beverly Hills Chihuahua the movie seemed silly and overly sentimental. On renting the DVD my opinion was changed. The film is a nice little adventure story set in Mexico.

The story concerns Chloe, a very spoiled Chihuahua, who is indulged by her human played by Jamie Lee Curtis.  Chloe (nicely voiced by Drew Barrymore) is part of the dog smart set and has her own social schedule and a collar from Harry Winston that costs a small fortune.  She spurns the attentions of the landscapers Chihuahua named Popi because he is not in her class. The story gets interesting when Jamie Lee Curtis must go to Europe on a business trip and leaved Chloe with her niece Rachel (played by Piper Perabo) who is a not very responsible.

Rachel is invited to go on a short trip to Mexico and takes Chloe along. This is where the adventure begins as Chloe is stolen by a dog-fighting ring but manages to escape.  There is a race to find Chloe, who is protected by a German Sheppard named Delgado (voiced by Andy Garcia) between the dog fighters (who want to ransom Chloe) and Rachael.

What makes the film satisfying is that the characters develop and change. Chloe realizes the value of friendship and that she has been spoiled and Rachael becomes more responsible and determined in her search for the missing Chloe.  There also is an interesting sub-plot with two abandoned dogs that need a new home and find one thanks to Rachel.

Altogether this is a satisfying film with a lot of humor and adventure. In the process, we learn about Chihuahuas and have a good time.  The story is well-conceived and the actors do a marvelous job.",1239580800,3,1645,4.587030716723549

3518725,3,B001CTDH58,"I'll start with a personal confession.  If I'm in a theatre and a trailer comes on advertising a film in which dogs talk, play basketball, or turn into lawyers, I nearly gag.  (A notable exception is ""Babe"" which featured talking pigs, dogs, sheep and other livestock.  But Babe the Pig not only talks, he is noble and surrounded by other character who aren't intellectually insulting.) It's also worth mentioning that in real life I honestly wonder about the mental health of people whose relationships with pets are more meaningful than their relationships with other humans.

That being said - ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" is a cute and enjoyable movie.  Chloe (voice by Drew Barrymore) is the pampered pet of a cosmetics tycoon, played by Jamie Lee Curtis.  Chloe has more outfits than my wife and all my daughters, along with a diamond collar that could be traded for a stealth bomber.

Chloe lives with Viv in a Beverly Hills Mansion, where she gets to lounge around with other pampered pooches and make fun of Papi (voiced by George Lopez), the mutt owned by Viv's landscaper.

Viv goes out of town, leaving niece Rachel (played by Piper Perabo) in charge of everything including Chloe.  Rachel promptly heads for Mexico with her young and irresponsible friends and Chloe.

When the young girls head out for a night on the town, Chloe decides she won't be left behind and heads out on her own.  She is quickly captured and taken to a dog-fighting operation where she is thrown into a ring with a Doberman (voice by Edward James Olmos).  She is rescued by former police German Shepherd Delgado (voice by Andy Garcia) and the remainder of the film is about Chloe trying to get back home while being helped by Delgado.

Along the way they meet the canine versions of just about every Mexican stereotype known.

At this point of the review I realize that I am describing a not very good movie.  Let me put it this way - life is too short to watch bad movies, eat bad food, listen to bad music, etc.  For movies, especially rentals and cable, I simply stop watching if they're really, really bad.  We rented this because of visiting relatives and I watched it to the end.  So I'll offer the lukewarm: it's not really, really bad.

I actually hadn't seen the movie when I wrote my review for Slumdog Millionaire, which opened about the same time:

""One of the inequities of the movie business is that a film like Slumdog Millionaire can only open in a few theaters in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, and take weeks to arrive at ""lesser"" destinations like Atlanta and Houston and St. Louis, while Beverly Hills Chihuahua opened nationwide on thousands of screens. I'm just sayin'.""

So I'll sum up by saying that while Beverly Hills Chihuahua isn't as good as the film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture this year, it isn't really, really bad.",1238371200,6,2852,4.664

3518730,3,B001CTDH58,"""Beverly Hills Chihuahua""  combines live action and CGI technology in a movie that dog lovers will enjoy.

When a stylish chihuahua named Chloe (voice of Drew Barrymore) is misplaced by a careless dog-sitter (Piper Perabo), she must find her own way back to her pampered Beverly Hills life.  Basically a canine road trip, the film shows Chloe unexpectedly tossed into the non-indulgent real world as she tries to get home.  She's helped by a German shepherd, Delgado (voice of Andy Garcia), and a posse of new dog friends, while Papi (voice of George Lopez), Chloe's ardent admirer, sets out on a mission to rescue his beloved.

The movie is silly but offers lots of laughs, most of them visual -- chihuahuas wearing sunglasses, a tribe of singing chihuahuas, assorted tricks, and muzzle-replacement animation that gives the illusion the dogs are mouthing words.  Disney has had great success through the years with dog stories such as ""Lady and the Tramp"" and ""101 Dalmatians,"" and this one, though not on par with those classics, is fun.  Kids will probably enjoy seeing Chloe decked out in foolish outfits her owner thinks are chic.  Other voice talent is provided by Placido Domingo, Edward James Olmos, Luis Guzman, and Cheech Marin.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray edition include deleted scenes, bloopers, and featurettes on training the dogs and the voices behind the dogs.",1237420800,,1380,5.017543859649122

3518753,4,B001CTDH58,"Dogs are crowd pleasers. That's one of the reasons Beverly Hills Chihuahua was a surprise hit at the movies last year. And rather than a lot of head scratching about why other, more ""lofty"" films didn't fare as well, perhaps it's because high concept films -- ones that have a premise so simple and fun-sounding that usually the title tells it and the trailer is loaded with signature gags.

The good news is that ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" is on a par with Disney light comedies of days past, the kind that weren't classics but were as pleasurable as popsicles and left happy childhood memories, though somewhat more elaborate and technically lush.

Director Raja Gosnell has no illusions that he's filming Brecht or Proust -- he literally begins his commentary (thanks for having one!) with a self-deprecating anecdote. But what emerges from his detailed explanations of the intricacies of filmmaking with dogs and special effects, as well as the talents involved, are skill, professionalism and enthusiasm.

One of the most interesting aspects of the film technique, making the dogs seem to have conversations and interact together, is similar to combining live action and animation. The dogs are usually filmed individually, then composited in the film lab to appear together. In editing, specific poses and movements are pinpointed and then the mouths and brows are animated.

Although most dialogue is pre-recorded, the voice actors' improvisations are added and the characters developed. George Lopez's comedy inventiveness was such that Papi's character was expanded from a minor role. In fact, the whole film evolved from a more straightforward, serious story to a comedy (a fact proven by deleted scenes on the DVD).

Drew Barrymore, who deserves more recognition for her capabilities as a voice actor, manages to convey sympathy for a fairly whiny little pooch.

I am buying the DVD so I can catch all the little comments, etc. that I probably missed the first time around. (I was too busy laughing!) You don't have to be a Chihuahua-owner to thoroughly enjoy BHC. In fact, two of my favorite characters were a green iguana and a rat who are little scam artists. Very very funny.

I'm definitely getting this movie for my parents. They are an older couple who seldom go to movies because they cannot stomach the language and content of most films; so ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" is perfect for them.  Although the movie was about a lost dog, it wasn't so sad or overly dramatic that I would be afraid to take a young child to see it.

3518783,5,B001CTDH58,"Walt Disney has had success with their canine films, especially since their 1997 film ""Air Bud"" and recently with their ""Buddies"" (talking puppies) films that utilize special effects showcasing the mouth movements with the voice work.

As many of those films were direct-to-video, Walt Disney Pictures took things up a notch by having ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" as a feature film and taking things to a new level in this enjoyable, family/adventure film starring a talented cast which includes Drew Barrymore, Jamie Lee Curtis, George Lopez, Piper Perabo, Andy Garcia, Manolo Cardona, Cheech Marin, Paul Rodriguez, Placido Domingo, Edward James Olmos and many other talents.

And on one end of the spectrum, you have these well-known talented human actors but ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" probably features the most canine talent anyone probably will see in a film.

And sure enough, the film resonated well with audiences in Fall 2008 taking the #1 spot in the box office and grossing over $29 million in its first weekend beating out major heavy hitters.  But can a film about chihuahuas really be that entertaining?  Definitely.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

I have to give credit to Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment because their Blu-ray disc releases have been phenomenal in terms of picture and audio quality.  The same can be said for ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" which features the dogs outdoors quite a bit in Los Angeles and Mexico. Video is presented in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ratio of 2:40:1.

From the blue skies, amber sun, and various locations of where the film was shot, the picture quality was great!

The audio quality is also very good.  At English 5.1 uncompressed (48 kHz/24-Bit) audio, the film relies mostly on dialogue and music which comes out radiantly clear on your front channel speakers but there are times where you hear the special effects utilized in the rear channels as well.  You can hear the vocals clearly, so overall, the audio quality was very good!

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" contains a good number of special features that are exclusive to Blu-ray.

  * Pet Pals: The Voices Behind the Dogs -  A very good special feature with interviews with Drew Barrymore, George Lopez, Andy Garcia, Cheech Marin, Paul Rodriguez, Placido Domingo, Edward James Olmos and more.  The talent talk about their role and talking about the dogs that they own.  Afterwards is a segment featuring Drew Barrymore and the charity organization that she works with about rescued dogs.
  * Hitting Their Bark:  On Set with the Dogs of BHC - This featurette goes into the making of the film and you can literally see how many dogs were used on the film and how certain scenes were accomplished.  I was amazed of how bright the dog that plays Chloe was.  Hitting her mark and a great job for a canine in the film.  The same can be said with the others.  Of course, there were challenges such as placing Chloe on top of Delgado's head/back.  You could tell the dog that plays Delgado wanted none of that.  But overall, a very impressive featurette because I can imagine how challenging it was to make everything come together for this film.
  * More Deleted Scenes with Introductions by Director Raja Gosnell - 45 minutes of deleted scenes and each scene was introduced by the director.  What's amazing is that the scenes cut were actually quite major but I can tell for pacing and time reasons, they needed to really stay at 91 minutes, I don't think fidgety children would watch two hours or more.  So, great idea to trim it down but the type of footage featured, I can imagine how difficult things it was to cut because one cut went into explaining more about Rachel's character and how she's been unsuccessful in finding a job.  But the scenes that were largely cut were the scenes that focused on the chihuahuas and their ancestry and the original script was more on that and more spiritual in that these chihuahuas will be watched over by the ghost of their ancestors.  So, a lot of deviation from the original script but the director made the right cuts.
  * Blooper Scooper - Not bloopers per se but more of behind-the-scenes fun with the dogs and the cast and crew.  A fun special feature.
  * Legend of the Chihuahua Animated Short - A short about the history of Chihuahuas but it becomes more of a fun animated scene about the chihuahua not being denied and how far they have come for a dog species.
  * Feature Audio Commentary by Director Raja Gosnell
  * The following utilizes BD Live (Music Chat, Movie Mail, Movie Challenge and Disney Movie Rewards Live)

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" is a fun and enjoyable action film that the whole family can enjoy.

The film was a success grossing over $29 million in its opening weekend and $117 million worldwide (beating out the terrorism thriller ""Body of Lies"" starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe).  So, it's quite obvious that the film resonated well with the movie audience and as some film critics have mentioned, with the state of our economy, sometimes you need a lighthearted film to make you laugh.

And this film will make you laugh as it features comedic talents such as Cheech Marin, Paul Rodriguez and George Lopez and then you have a good amount of talent with Jamie Lee Curtis, Drew Barrymore, Piper Perabo, Andy Garcia, Manolo Cardona, Edward James Olmos and many others involved.  Having all these talents and also well-known Latino talent together for a Disney film, that's wonderful!

Quite a bit of Disney CG magic in this film with their technology of the canines talking and matching the actual words they are speaking.  Also, certain CG such as the introduction of an actual rat who works with an iguana, an army of chihuahuas to a scene where Delgado and Chloe face off against mountain lions.  But I have to admit that the crew did an amazing job because those scenes look quite realistic.

One thing I also found pretty cool was the score.  Composer Heitor Pereira did a wonderful job as did the 57-piece Hollywood Studio Symphony conducted by Nick Glennie-Smith!

If anything, I was surprised because I have been reviewed and watch the ""Buddies"" films with the talking canines and they typically have been direct-to-video.  But to watch a feature film with all this talent, the different locations where the film was shot, musical score and of course, the amazing CG work, I was quite impressed.

Also, what Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment has done to add so much of these awesome special features as Blu-ray exclusives is wonderful!  The awesome picture and audio quality continues their dedication to Blu-ray and again, another great BD release!

I know it seems odd for those not familiar to the Disney canine films and wonder, are these films worth it?  So, far every Disney film with the talking canines have been great family films thus far.  And ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" is another one that continues that tradition.

The film is rated PG and of course, a large doberman pinscher going after a defenseless chihuahua may seem scary to younger children but overall, I had my six-year-old with me and he was really enjoying the film and laughing aloud at certain scenes.

Of course, these types of films may not be for everyone but if you have children and are looking for a film that the family can enjoy together, definitely give ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" a try!",1235865600,4,7412,4.827914353687549
3518784,4,B001CTDH58,"The trailer for this film was a spectacular Busby Berkeley-style musical number that looked mighty fun, but has little to do with the final film. Personally, I thought this film was going to be a turkey, but it turned out to be a very well-done and fun family film.

Here's the story: Vivian (Jamie Lee Curtis) is a wealthy Beverly Hills businesswoman who practically worships Chloe (voice of Drew Barrymore), her chihuahua, dressing it in designer outfits and giving it an over-the-top real diamond collar. When Chloe has to go out of town, her flakey niece Rachel (Piper Perabo) is left in charge. Rachel goes south of the border to Mexico to party with her friends and Chloe gets dog-napped while there. Chloe is rescued from the Mexico City dog fights by a German Shephard, Delgado (voiced by Andy Garcia), who becomes her ""bodyguard."" The dognappers learn of Chloe's/Vivian's wealth and they want her back at all costs. Rachel also desperately wants Chloe back and teams up with Viv's landscaper handsome Sam (Manolo Cardona). Predictably, the journey is about Chloe losing her Beverly Hills snobbery (and Chanel No. 5 scent) and Rachel maturing; this helps pave the way for Chloe and Rachel to find true love with mates they would have previously not thought worthy. Sam's chihuahua Pap&iacute; (voice of George Lopez) pursues Chloe during the entire movie and helps Sam & Rachel find her. Naturally, the motivation of the movie is to find and return Chloe before Viv returns from her trip.

Is the plot predictable? Sure...but boy is it fun to watch. Barrymore, Garcia, and Lopez have great chemistry, and the special effects/stunt work for the dogs is amazing. You actually believe they are talking after awhile, it's that good. There are a few semi-scary scenes that the younger ones might be a little freaked by, but nothing having an adult nearby wouldn't take care of. Although a dialogue-driven film, the lively music and some of the sound effects will give your speakers a more than ample workout.

DVD & Blu-ray Extras:

* Legend of the Chihuahua: An all-new animated short that is very fun; very reminiscent of the Disney classic cartoon ""Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom"" in its style and storytelling.

* Blooper Scooper: Blooper reel that shows a little of the difficulty in getting the dogs to do what they were supposed to do.

* 3 Deleted scenes with intros by Director Raja Gosnell: These are fun, but not essential to the plot and were wisely removed. They are shown at various stages of development, as the animation (for the dogs to speak) is missing in many of these. Scenes are:
1. Chihuahua Nation
2. Chloe's Vision Quest (would have really dragged the plot down)
3. Mi Coraz&oacute;n: Chloe and Papi's Duet

* Audio commentary (widescreen version only) by Director Raja Gosnell. Interestingly enough, Gosnell had the voice talent dub together, so that ad-libbing could be used and that they could play off each other. It works, as the chemistry in this film between the dogs really is apparent.

Blu-ray Exclusive Extras:

* Pet Pals: The Voices Behind the Dogs
* Hitting the Bark: On set with the dogs of ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua""
* Additional deleted scenes
* BD-Live (US Only)

3518785,1,B001CTDH58,"One of the worst childrens' movies I have seen.
My three-year-old daughter and I went to the theater to watch it because at the time, there was not other kid movie out and we ended up leaving early because neither of us found the movie at all entertaining. The 45 minutes we where there seemed like hours--I was in agony.
The jokes are old and overdone and rely on really obvious sterotypes that weren't ever funny. ""Hold your tacos!"" It's predictable.
My daughter, who loves Wall-E and Kung Fu Panda, even Once, did not like this at all...it was hell to sit through. Hell!",1235779200,9,573,4.519230769230769

But as soon as the action moved to Mexico, I found myself totally caught up in the characters and the story. The animals were very well trained, the ""talking"" animation was great, the voice-overs were handled very well by the cast, and the story was involving, funny, and ultimately even moving.  I'm completely happy that I gave this one a try!",1233878400,16,483,4.604651162790698
3518788,4,B001CTDH58,"I know how much cinephiles loathe this motion picture and others of its genre, but, dudes and gals, loosen up! Sure, ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua: [1]"" is more than a little ""sappy"", but take some time out to be ""sappy and happy"" viewing this movie (available as viewed on DVD, among other DVD and Blu-Ray editions, as Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment 057850/02)! The adventures of these chihuahuas, other dogs, and assorted animals is a delight, especially for those who have a ""tender spot"" for the hounds! This movie never was meant to appeal to the viewer's sophistication. On the other hand, it is not any sort of ""chihuahua exploitation film"", either.

My favourite hounds in this California-Mexico romp are Pap, Chlo's ardent male admirer and very determinedly valiant chihuahua, and Delgado, the down-on-his-luck, butch German shepherd who rescues, and does various acts of kindness for, Chlo, even when he misinterprets the reasons for Chlo's second disappearance. Then, too, who cannot love the thronging hoard of chihauhuas among the ruins of an ancient indigenous culture? Seeing Chlo try to find the mighty voice of her ""inner chihuahua"" (as opposed to pampered pet squeaks and whimpering) with the aid of the leader of this pack of chihuahuas is very amusing; I wish that this bit of animal humour had been more extended!

This is a pack of fun, and not just for children! Have a barking good time watching this film, in the theatre or at home on the DVD or Blu-Ray player!

----------
Postscript, July 2014: Since writing the above, I have seen parts two and three, the sequels of the Chihuahua trilogy, i.e. ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua: 2, the Family Just Got Bigger"" (Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment 105886) and ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua: 3, Viva la Fiesta, Family Always Matters"" (Disney 109086/02). Each leading canine cast favourite hound will bound around on your screen for more Chihuahua mania! My favourite of the two sequels is the ""Beverly Hill Chihuahua: 3"", which is wonderfully zany and replete with one madcap antic after another. In that one, Papi and Chlo (and the others) celebrate daughter Rosita's ""quinceaera"" (its timing reckoned in equivalent ""dog years""), while some skullduggery has been taking place at a fancy Beverly Hills pet hotel, where a treacherous female employee and a suspicious administrative hound, on behalf of the leading rival such establishment, the two of them colluding with an outside secret agent, are undertaking some disloyal commercial spying and sabotage, which Delgado, Papi, and others uncover and thwart, saving their human master's and mistress' jobs there while they are at it. The canine Mariachi band for Rosita's party and during the rehearsals for it is especially droll and endearing.

Don't miss these movies! You and the children or teenagers of your household also might enjoy the attractively written, printed, and illustrated ""junior novels"" published so far (as of mid-2014) which are based on the first two films of the trilogy!",1230163200,21,3015,5.134419551934827
