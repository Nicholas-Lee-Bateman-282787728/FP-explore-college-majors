8081478,1,B000B5IOKW,"This movie is one of the great and beautiful classics of all time, but the film and sound quality of this particular DVD was terrible.  Like someone copied it from a VHS.  I own a VHS copy of the movie and winded up seeing that instead and it was far better than the DVD, which I returned.",1441584000,,289,4.052631578947368
8081479,5,B000B5IOKW,my grandma passed away in October and every new years we would watch this together...but the VHS was worn out and this past new years was very lonely without her. this was the only copy i was able to find on the internet and it was exactly as I expected. I saw the DVD and though its a sad movie to begin with I cried tears of joy because I was able to keep that little part of her with me and I will continue to watch it every year until the DVD wears out just like the VHS did. Thank you for having this in stock; it meant the world to be able to purchase such an old film.,1391644800,,575,3.8
8081480,5,B000B5IOKW,"I remember, as a little girl, watching this movie with my mother. I am not 50-years young and my mother 85-years. I take the movie every now and then when I visit her and reminisce on the past. You can't put a price on memories and my memory goes quite far!",1375747200,,257,4.0588235294117645
8081481,5,B000B5IOKW,"This is a movie I grew up watching every year with my mother and sisters. It's a tear-jerker, classic Arturo de Crdova and Marga Lpez, the most romantic couple ever in Spanish films. My mother is now 82 years old and I can't wait to receive my movie so that we can watch it together on New Year's Eve--just like we did when I was a little girl!",1229904000,7,344,4.073529411764706
8081482,5,B000B5IOKW,"I caught this on Spanish-language TV late one night, and I was hooked.  I watched it without subtitles and got the gist of the story.  Give it a chance!  If you are even remotely romantic, you'll understand EVERYTHING that's going on in the film.  As dated as it is, it's a good film  I give it 5 stars!!",1170374400,5,304,4.172413793103448
8081483,5,B000B5IOKW,"This romantic film, is really an academic principle in teaching the real meaning of love... flourished inside the heart of a beautifull woman called Mara (Marga Lopez, recently passed away), that with gracefullness carry her touchy illing love hoping that her beloved gentleman, the violinist Ricardo Caso (Arturo De Crdova), could remember the only night where both found themselves trapped in a revealing night of love... In the end, both ways collide again as the last opportunity to stay together but... One can understand that the life gives just one chance to be completely happy (maybe two times), but the selfish human being pass blindly through the life and refuse to take what most of the times is in front of him...So, How are you going to pass the rest of your life?...Good Luck!",1121126400,5,791,4.91044776119403
