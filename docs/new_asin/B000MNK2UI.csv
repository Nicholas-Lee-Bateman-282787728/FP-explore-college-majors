8170334,5,B000MNK2UI,"The Making of Star Wars (1977) is a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of one of the most popular movies in cinema history.  While most of the fifty minute documentary focuses on special effects, we learn about George Lucas, The Force, and the main characters of Star Wars.  George Lucas, the creator of Star Wars, was influenced by old Western movies, swashbuckling films, and the Flash Gordon serials of the 1930s.  In creating the special effects for Star Wars, Lucas utilized numerous techniques including stop-action photography, plastic models, glass painting shots, operating robots, computer-controlled cameras, and the use of blue screens with multiple exposures; one can see how far special effects have come since 1977!  Hosts C-3PO and R2-D2 make this an entertaining yet informative portrayal of a film set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.",1370044800,3,866,5.164285714285715
