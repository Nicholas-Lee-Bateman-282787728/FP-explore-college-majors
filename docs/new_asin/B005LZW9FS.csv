4831158,1,B005LZW9FS,"I like good cheap horror movies....some of the very best are low budget.  Cougar Cult is certainly low budget, but it is certainly also possibly the worst movie I've seen!  Very little dialogue:  if you cut out all the pointless boring scenes of guys in their underwear, and the repeated footage of the women walking in slow motion or performing some satanic rite over and over....well, you'd have about 5 minutes of very bad acting and dialogue to laugh at.  Special effects can be very cool in low budget movies, to see how a director can still do something good even if inexpensive.....but in this case, the ladies heads turn into a literal cartoon cougar heads!  Most of the movie was soft porn for aging women....but even then, it seems to fall flat and boring.....how damn long can a guy stand in the shower and move his hands across the same parts of his body over and over and over?  Move hands across back, across shoulders, and then across stomach....use no soap, just stand there moving his hands in the water, and not getting his perfectly fixed hair wet.....i mean, of course ratings might prevent out right pornograpy, but you'd think while bathing he'd have to at least TOUCH other parts of his body-men don't turn me on, but if they did, i think i could get more excitement from a soap commercial.....and when i hear a sound in the shower while i'm at someone else's house, i usually put on more than underwear before i stupidly walk around the house investigating the sound.....painted on tight as hell underwear for several minutes of just walking around, after an incredibly long and boring shower scene....only thing good i can say is that the dialogue and acting is very bad, and during the times when talking is going on, at least there's something to laugh at....but instead, there's one long drawn out scene after another with no talking, just guys in underwear.....sleeping with absolutely no covers, again in tight underwear, writhing on the bed because the evil women have sent them nightmares.....five minutes of a guy spraying himself with a water hose while at the pool.... this movie wins worst movie award....i didn't even finish it!  i usually can finish even the worst movies, but this one was too boring...only paid 50 cents with a red box discount...so 50 cents and about 45 minutes of my life.....hmmm, i got ripped off!  but i can now say i've seen the worst movie ever!",1349049600,5,2408,4.716666666666667
4831159,1,B005LZW9FS,"I can imagine how the plans for this one went:  Let's pay someone a few dollars to write some stupid story, pay the ""actors"" a few bucks each to attempt to act and fail at it, shoot the same scenes over and over with really dumb effects, and wonder how many times the viewer will fast forward it just to get to the end.",1344211200,3,319,3.984375
4831160,5,B005LZW9FS,"We are half way through director David DeCoteau's series of 1313 films and the parade of Boys is put aside a bit as the Dream Team of Scream Queens - Michelle Bauer, Linnea Quigley and Brinke Stevens take Center Stage for a Campy Reunion.
 The Nightmare Sisters are back and better than ever and having a ball showcasing their Comedic skills and still hot Bodies.
 And speaking of Hot Bodies, the cast includes Bryce Durfee, Carey James and Aaron Thornton to keep DeCoteau's cachet of loyal fans satisfied.
 Overall a highly enjoyable Romp that is sure to become a Cult classic!",1329436800,,578,4.702970297029703
4831161,4,B005LZW9FS,"1313: Cougar Cult is a decent throwback to 80's b-movies like Nightmare Sisters and Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama. That makes sense, because David Decoteau also directed those. I hope he continues to make movies like this, that are just campy fun, instead of movies like 1313: Nightmare Mansion. I really enjoyed seeing Brinke Stevens, Michelle Bauer, and Linnea Quigley onscreen together again. And all of the shirtless young men were hot. The movie does suffer from some of the same problems that Decoteau's other recent movies do, such as needless padding and no nudity. But this is a step in the right direction, and I hope to see these actresses in more Decoteau projects some day.",1329350400,,700,4.940677966101695
4831162,4,B005LZW9FS,"Let me preface by saying that over the years, I have pretty much watched every Rapid Heart/David DeCoteau movie to date and consider myself a big fan.  So far I've watched 4 films of this new 1313 series and have been pretty disappointed.  All have taken place at the same house.  All have had a lot of looping footage, showing the same scene over and over.  All have about 50 minutes of guys walking through the previously mentioned house saying Hello over and over.  And three of the 4 ended with not even the slightest bit of resolution.  I was pretty convinced that Mr. DeCoteau had given up.  Then comes Cougar Cult and it seems like David has learned from his mistakes.  This movie is a much needed step in the right direction, at least as far as the 1313 series goes.  For one, there's an actual story line this time around and a nice amount of character interaction and dialogue.  The three main ""Cougars"" are a lot of fun and take campiness to a new level but its really enjoyable.  The ""hot guys"" are definitely that..Hot! and the camera enjoys following them around in their underwear...a lot..and its great.  Still no rear nudity like in the good ol Edgar Allan Poe Series or the Brotherhood 5 which  would have been nice...especially in the 5 minute shower scenes, but here's hoping those return in future installments as well.  Overall, this film is good , the most enjoyable Rapidheart movie since Brotherhood 6, if you know what to expect...a goofy, campy movie with hot underwear clad boys  and some sassy actresses from yesteryear!",1328313600,4,1549,4.643382352941177

4831164,1,B005LZW9FS,"Terrible movie. Have to be honest did not watch to end, about 1/2 and that was because I had nothing else to do.  Eventually fell asleep. On a positive note the house the cougars resided was very nice. All acting (loosely used) stunk. I'd be really pissed if it were not free with prime.  IMHO don't waste your time, pick another.

4831173,1,B005LZW9FS,"To quote Yogi Berra: Watching this film is like ""deja vu all over again"". Decoteau even admits to using the same house (his own?) in this particular 1313 DVD as he does in the rest of the ""series"" (he even calls it the ""1313 house"" in his commentary). The three ""cougars"" look more like rejects from a Macbeth play even though DD keeps on raving how wonderful it was to get the ""original scream queens"" back. They not only chew up (off screen) a couple of their cubs but chew up all the scenery relentlessly.  After feeding on their current houseboy who is shown taking an endless shower (sans soap or shampoo) after cleaning the mansion's pool, the trio are now faced with a replacement dilemma.  It should be noted here that neither this first viewed shower nor one that follows by another ""hunk"" reveals anything.  The camera deftly stays in the northern hemisphere even though it sometimes wanders teasingly south only to return to its point of origin.  The showers are so lengthy and the same areas are washed and rewashed so many times that it's a wonder that the poor lads have any skin left for the ""cougars"" to munch on. Our story progresses when three college boys respond to an ad and turn up on the cougars' doorstep.  They are each given different chores to perform.  From that point on, all we see are the young men turning and twisting in bed while taking a daytime nap on their backs and having a night(day?)mare about the cougars. Or they are shown wandering through the barren looking 1313 house in their tidy whiteys in some kind of trance brought about by having a strange locket pressed to their foreheads by the head cougar. Only one of them seems to know the score and eventually helps his buddies to...(no ""spoiler"" here).  The rationale behind the cougars' behavior is not made totally clear nor why they are sometimes successful and other times not.  But this is, after all, a DD movie so you can forget any logical explanation.  There aren't even any real homoerotic overtones unless you consider a parade of semi-nude young men wandering through ""marble halls"" to be titillating.  Indeed, DD seems to have a fetish when it comes to his male actors wandering around in their underwear. I've saved the best for last: When the cougars change into ""real cougars"", they have a tiger(!) mask superimposed on their faces amidst a great deal of obnoxious ""growling"".  Some ""cougar"". They all look like refugees from a Halloween party gone bad.  DD admits that this movie was filmed in two days.  Really!?  I never could have guessed.  I assumed 12 hours at most.  To all: do yourselves a favor - skip this one - and get a nice pet cat instead, preferably one that doesn't look like a tiger.  And if you are a dog lover then you are probably more favorably disposed to werewolf movies in the first place.",1434412800,5,2823,4.602794411177645

4831175,1,B005LZW9FS,"Another piece of SH##.  They must of had a $5 budget on this one. When the 3 witches turn into cougar's their faces turn to paper masks of a cougar. By the way college boys running and walking around in their underware again. Taking a shower with no soap while feeling off their chest again. Feeling off their chest while sleeping again. And guess what a very weak storyline. This guy is no director and does not know how to make a movie. Also it's the same house and decore of his other movie I bought.  I've learned something ""You can package dog SH## and somebody will buy it. I bought two packages at the sametime. A WORD OF WARNING DO NOT BUY ANY MOVIE BY DAVID DeCOTEAU.

4831178,1,B005LZW9FS,"This so-called ""movie"" suffers from several flaws.  Let's address them one by one:

1.  Based on the title, you'd expect this movie to be something like an erotic thriller involving older women, younger guys, a few scary moments, a few nudie scenes, and maybe a few laughs.  Unfortunately, this movie has no blood, no sex, no nudity, no storyline, and no point. The end result is a movie that doesn't quite know what it wants to be.  It's not a horror film.  It's not an adult film.  It's not a comedy.  It's...none of the above, and not in a good way.

2.  Some of the scenes are repetitive and go on WAY too long.  There are several scenes in which a man is taking a shower or lying on a bed in his underwear while he moves his body and arms in a semi-sexual way.  Homosexual men and middle-aged women might find this erotic, but straight guys looking for T&A or blood and gore will be sorely disappointed.  Even worse, these scenes drag on for several minutes each and happen multiple times throughout the movie.  The movie is only about 75 minutes long overall, so wasting about 20 minutes with these boring and repetitive scenes is inexcusable.

3.  The storyline is ridiculous.  You have no idea why the women are literally turning into cougars and performing their crazy rituals until halfway through the movie.  Then when they turn into cougars, only their face gets covered up by a cougar picture and really sorry animation.  It looks like something a college-level film class would produce.  It looks really, really bad.

4.  The acting is uninspiring.  There are very few laugh lines and very few moments of suspense.  There are no memorable one-liners or scenes you want to replay.  It's just dull.  Very dull.

5.  The ""climax"" of the movie is horrible.  Kids cartoons have more interesting climaxes than this film.  I'm not going to spoil it for any masochists who may want to subject themselves to this garbage, but if ""that"" was all it took to end the cougar threat, then there never was much of a threat to begin with.

This is easily the worst movie I've seen in years.  I would not recommend it to anyone with the exception of letting it illustrate what NOT to do with a movie.  I will never consider watching a movie by this director or these actors again.  It's really that bad.  I am upset that I wasted a quiet afternoon in which my wife and kids were out of the house while I watched this garbage.  BEWARE!",1384646400,,2430,4.505747126436781
4831179,2,B005LZW9FS,"Michelle Bauer won my devotion three decades ago, though not for her ""scream queen"" horror film work.  It was her mid-1980s performances in the first two California Star TIED & TICKLED videos, where she was billed as Pia Sands, and in the  H.O.M. movie TICKLED TORMENT, where she was billed as Kim Bittner, that did it.  She could have knocked me over with a feather and, don't I wish, let me tickle her with it. In particular, that first TIED & TICKLED, where Ms. Bauer takes off all her clothes and is tickled while tied to a bed, and later helps tickle another restrained woman, sends my heart to the sky just thinking about it even after all this time.

Some years later I sent Michelle Bauer a fan letter, to which she graciously replied and included a very sexy photo.  At that point she said she was retired, though maybe she meant just from kink and other adults-only acting work.  This COUGAR CULT film's new and there's Michelle Bauer, looking lovely as ever.  If you're like me, hoping for a nude or even just topless scene, Ms. Bauer is still retired from that, at least for now.

Of all movies with which to finally catch up with Michelle Bauer, this one gets my hopes up as her character runs her fingers about the lower legs of a young man who, wearing just briefs, is passed out on a bed.  I was pulling for Ms. Bauer to tickle his bare feet but, alas, no luck.  Frankly, I wonder how the guy didn't flinch just from having her touch his lower legs, as that would have tickled me were I lucky enough to be in his position.  Considering the two other COUGAR CULT actresses also look good, I'd loved to have seen it build to a tickling climax where they tie and tickle Ms. Bauer.

Like most other reviewers here, I can't recommend COUGAR CULT as being very good but can qualify that by saying if you want to see the definition of feminine beauty, charm, and class, see this film just for Michelle Bauer.",1370563200,,1917,4.3841807909604515
4831180,5,B005LZW9FS,"This is a true camp film, but is taking a lot of flack because it's filled with scantily clad guys instead of women. It's a bit ahead of its time, but clearly True Blood, Spartacus, and Twilight have proven that there's a market for man candy. Also keep in mind the type of movies and editing style that this is parodying; they were ridiculous with poor special effects.",1359763200,,370,4.455882352941177
4831181,1,B005LZW9FS,"Three college hunks accept a job offer as the personal assistants to three voluptuous older ladies, unaware that they have just signed on with a coven of witches who plan to sacrifice them to earn their own immortality! Notorious B-movie director David DeCoteau reunites the original Scream Queens of Horror for the first time in years as Brinke Stevens, Linnea Quigley and Michelle Bauer return to the small screen in 1313: COUGAR CULT, which is by all rights a mockery of filmmaking. DeCoteau spends over half the run time filming the boys in various stages of undress as they either shower incessantly or toss and turn in bed (in the middle of the day). The shots would be repetitive at best, but the tiring scenes lose all sense of eroticism as they reach the point of absurdity. The ladies have lost none of their particular talents, and we use that in the loosest meaning of the phrase possible. One can expect all of the same silliness and gross overacting that made their careers in the 1980's, minus any middle-aged nudity. We did find momentary satisfaction in the film's awful special effects, however, where the stationary image of a cougar is superimposed over each of the witches' faces in one of the most ridiculous transformations ever caught on film. While the allusions to the Horror classic CAT PEOPLE is appreciated, DeCoteau falls just short of Jacques Tourneur. And when David DeCoteau's worst isn't good enough, it's time to just film half naked men and forgo any attempts at plotting or character development. Rated: ""S"" for sexless softcore porn.
