8051722,4,B0007U3FEQ,"This video is good to have in case you actually want to complete a full field strip, you will get walked through step by step, the guy talks A  LOT, but very useful information.",1396742400,,177,4.205882352941177
8051723,5,B0007U3FEQ,"a lot of blah blah blah, but it covered everything.
less blah blah blah and more explaining as performing the work would have been better.
but it is still a great investment",1365552000,,173,4.4375
8051724,4,B0007U3FEQ,"The video quality is pretty good, the detail is very good.  I would recommend this to anyone who has the desire to learn to tear down your pistol, clean, repair and reassemble your pistol.",1361577600,,188,4.529411764705882
8051725,5,B0007U3FEQ,"I've never bought a product of this company until now. Many time you'll purchase these do-it-yourself type of homemade videos and they have cheesy music and a really crap-tastic fade in and fade out of lame pictures of paintings you'd find in a doctors waiting room. THIS VIDEO ISNT ANY OF THAT! I was not only entertained during the entire video but learned how to disassemble my fire arm and retained all of the information in regards to the process. The instructor of the video also tends not to treat you like an idiot, he explains things in a fashion that is very easy to understand the first time he says it and is very informative. This video is perfect for persons who are excited about the XD and want to learn more about them without it feeling like a chore to do so. At the end of this video you WILL feel comfortable disassembling your XD. You WILL feel you got your money's worth. You WONT be disappointed.",1215129600,5,919,4.443786982248521
8051726,5,B0007U3FEQ,"The video was very deatiled, and helped drastically. I was able to copletely disassemble my firearms for customization.",1197504000,3,119,5.666666666666667
8051727,5,B0007U3FEQ,Lenny Magill as always does an excellent job in this installment of Complete Disassemby/Reassembly for the Springfield XD.  All parts are named using the correct nomenclature with excellent filming and Mr. Magills running commentaries give insight not only to the anatomy of the pistol but to its workings as well. Highly recommend.,1178409600,6,332,5.384615384615385
