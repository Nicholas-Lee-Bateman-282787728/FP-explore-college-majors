7926793,5,B00004Y7CR,""" Old Man Out "" with Mary Ann Mobley as special guest star was the best 2 - part episode of season one, possibly ever, of the IMF series from the sixties. It was my all time favourite, and I agree with fellow reviewers, this entire series, or at least the first 4 - 5 seasons should be on DVD. However I ordered it  August 2004, and after several messages saying it would be sent, I finally received a message saying NONE of Amazons suppliers can provide it for me. SO DON'T GET EXCITED ABOUT IT!!! Because they don't have it!!! So why is it still advertised on their site?? The other thing is my copy of "" The Bunker "",which was my all-time 2nd. fave episode was sent, but has 6-7 flaws in the videotape!! I love the service,(Amazon.ca), but you have really let me down this time! Take Volume 3 off your site for Gods' sake!- Ron Larocque.",1105574400,4,840,4.25
7926794,4,B00004Y7CR,"One of the finest exhibitions of plotting, stealth, pinpoint timing, acting, writing, and oh yeah, true IMF coincidences,
few fans will want to leave their seats during this two parter!
 The plan is to free a cardinal bishop from a high security prison which has never been victim to a prison escape. Martin Landau's interaction with the frail cardinal took on a
somewhat father son quality. Mary Ann Mobley was brilliant
as the trapeeze artist. She and Barbara Bain worked their seductive magic in an effort to stall and divert the guards attention. The fine performances by Greg Morris as the clown and Peter Lupus punctuate the episodes. And of course, no 1st season episode would be considered a
classic without the great Steven Hill. His ability to slide
from total involvement to complete anonymity is a gift
that was occasionally explored but never eclipsed by Peter Graves. This episode along with Operation Rogosh and Ransom leaves you with a marvelous and wistful taste of
what could have been of Mission had Steven Hill stayed on.
Fine television viewing right to the finish!!",1016409600,6,1087,4.939890710382514

7926796,5,B00004Y7CR,"OLD MAN OUT is arguably the best two-parter in MISSION's long history, and definitely stands out among the rarely-seen first season episodes. OLD MAN OUT finds the IMF in all their mindbending glory, attempting to liberate ailing political prisoner Cardinal Vossek (Cyril Delevanti) from an impregnable fortress. Although not as sophisticated as later shows, the episode does feature outstanding performances by Martin Landau, Barbara Bain and guest star Mary Ann Mobely. It also features some of the best character interaction in the series. OLD MAN OUT, more than any other show, makes the IMF appear comprised of human beings as opposed to the deadly clockwork machines they later became.",982627200,6,691,5.348623853211009
