31329,5,0780622383,"Until sitting down this weekend with the DVD of Dolores Claiborne, I hadn't paid much mind to the film.  Yet after seeing this pristine 2.35 print and listening to Taylor Hackford's commentary, this film is clearly  an unsung gem.  I don't know whether Hackford is a angel or a terror to  work with, but I can't recall a better director's commentary.  I've gotten  so tired of all of these so-called commentaries where a group of people  (the director, some actors, various flunkies) sit around and make witless  jokes, meander wildly and say very little about the artistic process of  making the film in question.  Hackford, here, is all alone, and he talks  nonstop through the commentary, giving his co-workers enormous credit and  giving the viewer/listening a direct and perceptive discourse on the  process of making a film.  You'll understand more about Magritte, the  differences between Kodak and Fuji film, Nova Scotia and so much more by  the end.  Hackford's commentary is so heartfelt and persuasive, that you'll  want to rewatch the film again to appreciate the subtleties of his  incredible actors Bates and Leigh and of the film itself.  My only quibble  is that Hackford thinks that those blue screen shots towards the end look  real, when they look as weird as those Michael Mann blue screens in Heat.  The weirdness of the blue shots are fine for the film, but don't kid  yourself that they actually look like the real world.  Otherwise, a very  high recommendation for this film!",926208000,2,1499,4.896
31330,4,0780622383,"The power of this film lies in the cinematic tone, the psychological tension among the characters, and the story-line itself. The acting is superb. The story unfolds at the end a kind of redemption, of the mother  and the mother-daughter relationship. This film stimulates reflection in  the contemporary male-dominated family relationships. The cinematography is  excellent. Both the mother and the daughter are uniquely expressed.",917568000,,432,5.71875
31331,5,0780622383,"Talk about an overlooked performance....In ""Dolores Claiborne,"" Kathy Bates turns in an Oscar-caliber performance that is just as good, if not better, than her Annie Wilkes in ""Misery."" Timing was off on  the original release of this film...It came out in early Spring and by the  time Oscar voters were perusing performances, Ms. Bates was forgotten. It's  too bad.... By all means, pick up this film for her acting, and for a  fascinating, extremely well made film.",917481600,,467,5.025974025974026
31332,5,0780622383,"Many have said that this is one of the few cases where a film was indeed  better than the book.  No disrespect to Stephen King, I know he is the  world's most popular novelist for a reason, but the book paled in  comparison to this film in every way.  The dialogue in this film is worth  the price of admission alone, and Kathy Bates' performance is flawless.  Jennifer Jason Leigh gives us a harrowing performance as her daughter on  the verge of destruction at every turn, a woman who is so afraid of her own  past and the brutal truth of her life that she drowns herself in drugs and  alcohol, much like her abusive father.  The points of irony in this film  are marvelous, I won't give them away, as to do so would ruin much of the  surprise of this wonderful film.  I can't say enough, but I will keep it  breif, so pick this one up, and please buy the letterbox edition, it is  superior to the pan and scan version.  Happy viewing.

31343,5,0780622383,"I have never been so dissapointed and angry, as I was, when Dolores Claiborne didn't get an any Oscar in Academy Awards. If they understand anything of movie-direction or acting, there is so brilliant working together, that this movie had deserve all prizes for that. Stephen King`s psychology-drama tels story abouth Doleres- who has been charced for two murdere; many years ago her husband- and in the biginin of the movie an old lady to whom she does a made. Kathy Bates potrays a woman, wife and mother just a brilliant acting, that is breath taking; made her so alive deep character- that after few scene, all your symphaty is in her side. Jennife Jason Lee- who is one of the best actres, when you need a person for neurothig and mentaly ambivalense character- makes also just outstandin performance. Actors in supporting roles an old lady and Dolores husband are so brilliant too. Taylor Hacford has put this hard story on so beatufully scenes- specially balance of colours, present moments and past- that it makes this film on of the best drama ever. Blu-ray itself is also beatifull to watch; colours are rich and balance- picture is sharp.

Great Stephen King adaptation with Kathy Bates, Chris Plummer and Jennifer Jason Leigh firing off the acting chops to carry off this spooky tale of murder and molestation.

31363,5,0780622383,"Based on an atypical novel from Stephen King that doesn't have any monsters (well non-human ones) or supernatural elements, ""Dolores Claiborne"" began life as a novel for Kathy Bates. King was so impressed with Bates as Annie Wilkes in ""Misery"", he decided his next project would be something that Bates could play when it was adapted as a film.

SPOILERS:

Dolores Claiborne (Bates) has been working for Vera Donovan (Judy Parfitt) for decades. Now an ill and reclusive, Vera dies after tumbling down the stairs of her own home. Dolores is seen by the mailman as standing over Donovan with a rolling pin looking as if she is going to strike Donovan. With blood on her hands, the local police officer John MacKay (Christopher Plummer) shows up arresting her for murder. Determined to convict her after failing decades before to convict Dolores of her husband's murder (David Straitharin) during an eclipse, Mackay pulls out all the stops to see her convicted in court. Enter Dolores long estranged daughter Selena St. George (Jennifer Jason Leigh) who turns up after someone mysteriously faxes her that her mother is in trouble. Her return opens up memories for both that strains their already difficult relationship.

END OF SPOILERS:

Warner Archives does a fine job of transferring this underappreciated film to Blu-ray with a very nice looking transfer. Colors look solid and the use of flashbacks many times in the same sequence as the ""current"" sequences. These represent the memories that each woman has of the past (though mostly Dolores') reliving key moments tied to the current death of Vera. The supporting cast (including a young John O'Reilly) does a marvelous job of populating King's world and the screenplay by Tony Gilroy (""The Bourne Identity"") does a great job of capturing and translating the events in King's novel and director Taylor Hackford (""An Officer And A Gentleman"") directs with subtly trying jus to bring the world to life.

The audio sounds nice with a solid 5.1 presentation and English subtitles.

Often times Warner Archive releases have little to no special features. The one that we get here is a marvelous commentary from the director addressing the adaption issues, working with each actor,  translation of the script to screen, performances and technical aspects of the film. We also get the original theatrical trailer. While these special features are minimal, the commentary track makes up for the lack of additional content.

""Dolores Claiborne"" powered by a superb performance by Kathy Bates (one of his best and one that, sadly, didn't get an Oscar nomination), the film does justice to one of King's most complex and tricky novels where all the monsters are human.

Highly recommended.",1512604800,,2732,5.080357142857143

the plot

Dolores Claiborne is a woman who was married to an abusive man but who also had a daughter with him.  Her husband Joe is a drunk, who abuses Dolores physically and mentally, and their daughter Selena was sexually abused by her father.  When Selena was still a young teenager, Joe fell in a well and was killed during one of Maine's more popular solar eclipses.  Detective John Mackey was not convinced this was accidental, and pursued to build a case against Dolores.  There was no way of pinning it on Dolores without proof, so she beat the rap - although Detective John Mackey remains unconvinced.

Years later, Dolores was found standing over her elderly employer Vera Donovan with a marble rolling pin ready to smash her head in as Vera lay helplessly at the bottom of a flight of stairs. Dolores was brought in for questioning, but as this same detective is building a case, Dolores was out on bail.  Selena is a high profile reporter who lives in NYC now, but has come back to Maine to stay with her mother during this investigation.  Selena is not her mother's biggest fan; she herself is convinced that Dolores had killed her father.  Selena has blocked out the abuses she and her mother had gone through all those years ago, but has instead demonized her mother.

The two slowly take a walk down memory lane, despite the demons they are bound to uncover as they do, all the while as the detective is at last trying to put Dolores Claiborne behind bars.  This will clear up his almost perfect record of successful cases before he finally retires.  The one blemish, of course is Dolores getting away with murder way back when.  Will Dolores finally be put behind bars?  Will Selena finally forgive her mother?  Find out as you watch Dolores Claiborne.

the breakdown

This film is probably my favorite film adaptation of a Stephen King novel.  I know this is a somewhat of a bold statement, and maybe controversial as far as Stephen King fans are concerned, but I believe the performances of the cast, especially that of Kathy Bates (Dolores) and Jennifer Jason Leigh (Selena) are second to none.  This is a very emotional story, which demands for some major emotional performances and both Bates and Leigh deliver admirably.  Kathy Bates, in my opinion, has never given a better performance than here, including Stephen King's Misery.  The role of Dolores calls for the character to be portrayed through the years, from about 30 years old to about 60 years old.  Kathy Bates gives us a young optimistic, nave, mostly-smiling Dolores even in the face of such abuse.  Dolores seems to be too young and nave to fully realize her reality before it's too late.  When we cut to the scenes of the older Dolores, we see a frowning, pessimistic and tired woman, yet one who seems more knowledgeable and more aware of what life has to deliver to a woman in her situation.

The two eras in Dolores' life is luminously accented and clearly defined with the use of two different films used.  A brighter and more colorful Fuji film is used to film the flashback scenes, and a bluer; darker Kodak film is used to capture the present.  The different hues perfectly mirror Dolores' outlook on life, and then of course the brilliant use of a solar eclipse divides these two eras, the two colors, the two outlooks on life, and ultimately the two Dolores Claiborne's.

Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance was just as powerful as Bates.  For Selena it was the death of her father understandably that darkened her world, although it should have been something more sinister all along.  As Dolores walks Selena down memory lane slowly, Selena becomes more infuriated as her suppressed nightmares continually try to resurface via Dolores' words.  So far Selena has done wonders keeping the truth hidden and buried with drugs and alcohol while she lived in NYC, but she fears that nothing will be able to contain the monster that has been building inside for all these years.

That all seems a bit dramatic on my part as I read it back, so I suppose this just mirrors my love for the film and its details and nuances.  Joe was played by David Strathairn with such convincing veracity, and you'll find yourself hating him more and more each second he is on the screen.  Joe is an evil man, with a sole purpose to make everyone's life around him miserable.  Judy Parfitt (Ever After) who plays Vera Donovan is another gem here.  At first she seems like another thorn in Dolores' side, but very soon Vera aligns herself with Dolores' plight in a way that helps Dolores find the power that inside her all along.

Dolores Claiborne is a story written by Stephen King that has no supernatural nuances at all (movie wise anyway).  If you're looking for a horror movie, then you may be disappointed here.  If you are up for a gripping drama littered with fine performances, then you will be very pleased.

I watched the movie before I read the book and really enjoy it. It's relate-able to me, as I too live on a small island, where its based around a small fishing village, secluded and survives by tourism. Kathy Bates portrayal of Dolores is untouchable. She really fits the character and brings her to life. Jennifer Jason Lee as her daughter, really shows how your childhood and environment really shape the person you become. Her suspicions of her mother for not one, but both murders keep her at a distance and as the plot unfolds, you really see just how much she has forced herself to forget her life on a small island. Dolores's relationship with Vera is a story in itself. These two women, lived two different lives, came form two different places, but yet are so much like one another. They need each other to survive. The suspense and psychological aspects of the story really make the film. This movie is really a hidden treasure and for those who love mystery and thrills, should definitely watch this one!",1471392000,,1131,4.549019607843137

I also found the movie to be about 30 minutes too long. In addition, the child abuse aspect was very disturbing and unnecessary. That said, it was nicely atmospheric and intriguing to wonder about how this story rumbled inside of Mr. King's mind in addition to all of his other stories. The man is frightfully full of characters and ideas. Were it up to me though, I would have made one more pass at the script and edited out about 30 minutes or so.",1470009600,,678,4.475806451612903

In the movie, the characters don't like each other and they show it, which made me not like them.

31685,5,0780622383,"This is such a great story with an excellent cast.  I have probably seen this movie 10 times and each time, I love it.  The story, written by Stephen King, illustrates that he can write a good thriller with no horror and still keep your interest in the characters.  No spoilers here, but Jennifer Jason Leigh and Kathy Bates are wonderful as the Mother and Daughter who are at odds with each other, but still thick as thieves when the going gets tough...they have such chemistry.  The overlying message sticks out here that nothing is as it seems to be, not in the story, not in the characters and not in their relationships with each other...its truly about loyalty and its challenges.  Very dreary settings - overcast - but moody and great if you curl with a blanket, a cup of tea and in your pjs...its movie night!

31766,5,0780622383,"This movie, whose title may be a nod to James M. Cain's Mildred Pierce, is one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King book. Like Mildred Pierce, it is a story of a maligned and mistreated woman who prevails, but has a problematic relationship with an ungrateful daughter.  But King has a number of twists of his own.  The story is solid and the movie elicited great performances by Kathy Bates, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Christopher Plummer.  My favorite performance in the movie, however, is David Strathairn as her alcoholic, abusive husband.  I have followed David Strathairn's career and love the fact that he has departed from his usual educated, refined, and sensitive character here to play a drunken lout.  The movie will always be one of my favorites, and the picture quality on Amazon is quite good.",1430006400,2,812,4.81294964028777

She weaves her way through emotions like a beautiful tapestry in this picture.  Make no mistake, she curses and is no pansy but ultimately she puts on the performance Oscar worthy.  Her daughter is wonderful, the entire cast is excellent.  The storyline is so well written and orchestrated so incredibly that cleaning the house took second and I could not break away from this film.  Kathy Bates was masterful in Misery and equally if not more so here.  This is a movie that comes with a HUGE recommendation from me..it is mesmerizing from beginning to end.",1426982400,,713,4.693548387096774

31778,5,0780622383,"Simply put, a Masterpiece in film making, Superb and Underrated Indeed! Shame on Oscar voters for overlooking this marvelous piece of work. Director, Taylor Hackford, Katy Bates at her best ever, Jennifer Jason Lee, Christopher Plummer-- and the outstanding British actress, Judy Parffit, all deliver the best work of their career so far and should have WON OSCARS! From the haunting beginning to a continuously haunting mood, this dramatic and far better story of Stephen King thankfully spares us from gory creatures and instead gives powerful and profound characters to remember for years. The story manifests itself in a wondrous twisted plot through brilliant editing & cinematography. Do yourself a favor and watch it, and watch it again and recommend it to all who appreciate quality dramatic films.",1426550400,,806,5.3046875

Awesome movie and a must see!",1424390400,,315,4.015873015873016
31800,5,0780622383,"This movie has quickly become a favorite. The standout line in the movie, ""Sometimes being a bitch is all a woman has to hold on to,"" perfectly describes all three leading women. Vera, a woman accustomed to controlling the minutest details of her life, has become an invalid due to a stroke and is not even in control of her own body. All she can control is her bitchiness.
Dolores takes care of Vera 24/7/365 for 40$ a week. She could have easily have gotten a much better job but she understands that Vera needs her because no one else could take her bitching and bitch back as good as she got.
Selena's childhood trauma has so consumed her life that she has become a bitter, nervous wreck. Her personal life sucks and her mother is being accused of a second murder. The best Selena can do is be a bitch to try to keep emotional walls erected to protect herself.
This a movie about strong women and how they remain strong in the face of adversity. For a man, Stephen King understands how women will do whatever it takes to survive. Though this movie does not have his usual paranormal slant, it's still one of the best.",1424390400,2,1121,4.394230769230769

31833,5,0780622383,The acting in this film is outstanding and the actors selected for their parts are some of the best in the business. I have a copy of this and watch it several times during the year it is that great of a movie. Totally underrated and unappreciated which is a shame. Love how you can go from the present to the past within the same scene which only the best of the best can create. When will this diamond in the rough ever be put to blu ray? Shouldn't be that hard to do and I'm sure the end result would be breathtaking. Please whomever owns the rights to this film remaster it and release it to blu ray possibly as an anniversary edition with current interviews with the stars about the film and their character and maybe one with Stephen King and some other special features. I would definitely buy the blu ray with all those features or just the film itself.,1418860800,,861,4.288343558282208

Same goes for sexual abuse and how perpetrators bribe or groom children that trust them to steal the child's innocence to satisfy a base sexual desire for the adult involved. Dolores shows that women are not recognized and trusted in our society. Everyone is against her, even her whole family. Dolores finally has a confidante that is very rich, but very hateful. What a terrible friend to end up having, but one that ended up helping Dolores tremendously.",1414800000,,613,4.738317757009346

The performances by Kathy Bates and Jennifer Jason Leigh are / were Oscar-caliber performances.  The story about a mother trying to do what is best for her daughter, protecting her from an abusive father.  Tears came flowing once the daughter brought back her blocked out memories of abuse, and defends her mom for the current crime she is being investigated for. A powerful story of the love of a mother for her daughter.  The other actors also gave great performances.  Also can't beat the 2 day prime shipping.  The movie came on 2nd business day.

31895,4,0780622383,"A great tale, very well unfolded in cinema. Filmaking craft was mature. Use of color and shooting styles was better than normal for King productions. It reaches to the maturity of the shooting of Shawshank. Kathy Bates, what can I say? She nailed it. She owned it. The movie is hers. Period. A great role, wonderfully performed. I'd almost feel sorry for ay actress forced to play across from her but indeed Jennifer Jason Leigh stood her ground and did the most with the role she was given. They play very well off each other.

This is one of King's more subtle stories and might have been unexciting to film, but they captured the essence and showed us the lives in an interesting and engaging manner.

Overall, I'd give this film an A-. Excellent. Worth the watch.",1409356800,,767,4.591240875912408

It's sad, it's true, and happens every day. You, the victim, are NOT alone. I've seen this pain. I've lived this pain. I feel your pain. It's easier said than done but, Get FREE and be yourself.

Finally worked up the courage to watch it fully.  Why Parfitt and Bates didn't each win Academy Awards, I'll never fathom.  Frankly the whole cast should have won, as well as the film editor, the director, the cinematographer, the screenwriter.

Family breeds really intense relationships, often bitter ones.  This film doesn't sugar coat that fact, but explores it.  Intensely.

The only other film this intense I can think of, is the production of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf with Burton and Taylor, or maybe Guilty Conscience with Anthony Hopkins and Blythe Danner.

31954,4,0780622383,"I read the book years ago, and loved it.  I also liked the film.  I just wish there was more of Kathy Bates/Dolores Claiborne and Judy Parfitt/Vera Donovan, and that their scenes were not so often interrupted with scenes from the present.  Their scenes were so electric; they both had so much bite.  You could see real love and tenderness between them.  Vera Donovan formerly formidable but trying to keep her dignity towards the end, losing the love of her children after her brazen action, and Dolores Claiborne affectionate and wounded enough to exchange barbs.  I also wish the confrontation between Jennifer Jason Leigh/Selena St. George and Christopher Plummer/Detective Mackey were not so maudlin.  In a lesser actress, the scene would have totally sank, but Jennifer Jason Leigh was vulnerable and awkward enough in that scene to carry it.  This is one of Stephen King's better film adaptions.  It's a good story, mostly because of Kathy Bates, who is just amazing in EVERYTHING.  She is renown as a great actress, and I still don't think that's a good enough of an adjective to describe her.  She was stellar in everything - comedic and demonic and dramatic.  She was delicious in The Office and American Horror Story:  Coven.  Such diverse roles - is there anything she can't do?  A very good film because of her.  She elevated the film.",1396051200,,1347,4.842105263157895

31975,5,0780622383,"This movie should have gotten Oscars, but the subject matter is not pretty.  Child sexual abuse and spousal homicide are not watchable for just anyone.  Somewhat explicit, but well done.  The Acting is way beyond the norm.  Cathy Bates is incredible as the strong willed, tough wife.  This may well be Jennifer Jason Leigh's best film.  Her portrayal of the adult survivor of child sexual abuse is of a woman so broken that she's painful to watch.  Christohper Plummer is the perfect antagonist, as the cold and mean police detective.  David Strathairn gave backbone to the story with a laudable and believable abusive husband performance. And you will never forget Judy Parfitt's character.  Her presence precipitates the main story line.  Complex and involved, heartbreaking story.  I still cry when I watch it.  It has a good ending, though.

Wonderful photography and the makeup is incredible - very subtle, the aging of Kathy Bates and Judy Parfitt so belivable.  Everyone  does a really terrific job, directed by Taylor Hackford (Devil's Advocate, La Bamba, Ray and many other films).  To me, this is a perfect film.

32087,3,0780622383,"""Dolores Claiborne"" was the 1995 film version of the Stephen King novel of the same name that was considerable effort from director Taylor Hackford.  The performance by Kathy Bates was solid.  Jennifer Jason Leigh provided a very embittered character that we in final glimpses came to understand somewhat, which I think was too fleeting and Miss Jason Leigh should have been allowed to show more warmth as she seemed in the strange telling of the story somewhat overly dramatic.  Christopher Plummer has been better, certainly not giving a career defining performance as Bates very well could have.  I think Bates's performance could have been equal to her ""Misery"" character in another Stephen King movie.  Tony Gilroy's screenplay could have corrected these inaccuracies in achievement, but then his screenplay apparently may be based on an official Stephen King work, but fails to rise to the level of Hitchcock.  Hitchcock never lived down his mistake, that Gilroy bases his whole structure of the tale around, that could never be forgiven him in his 50 film career beyond ""Stage Fright"" in 1950 when he told a lie in a flashback.  This film cheats on this flaw to a major degree and thereby takes down an otherwise good film.  It is not a problem with Stephen King as the filmmakers could very well have told this tale without this ineptitude despite if one likes King or not.  Then, I do not consider myself too pleased with the public that took to King's popularity.",1349827200,,1473,4.883534136546185

It contains all the complications and legal conundrums that are necessary in a murder mystery yet, unlike many films in this genre, manages to avoid anything gratuitous in the ways of sex and violence and STILL be so compelling that even those who kind of enjoy gratuities won't miss them too much.

Most Stephen King stories take place in Maine, but this one has a real feel of authenticity.  ""Sometimes being a bitch is all a woman has to hold onto.""",1339200000,,384,4.536231884057971
32106,2,0780622383,"So, if you are a screenwriter and someone hands you a novel by Stephen King, in which the protagonist states at the outset that she killed her husband and then gives an interesting first person narrative of how it was justified, and in which the protagonist's daughter is intentionally kept out of the story at the protagonist's wishes, what would you do?

Here is what Tony ""I just read six John Grisham books"" Gilroy would do.  Eliminate the built-in narration provided for the lead character and instead write in a series of hallucinogenic flashbacks, and not only bring the grown daughter into the picture (again, intentionally written out by Stephen King), but make her the primary detective in a whodunit that attempts to very slowly answer the very obvious question of whether Kathy Bates killed her husband.

Herp dee derp.

I remembered this movie as being average but forgettable when I first watched it, but then took another look after reading the book and realized promptly that this is a two-star job.

Other than a poorly filmed ""teaser"" at the opening, half an hour transpires in the film before we see a scene that had any place in the book whatsoever.  The majority of this half hour is spent following the grown daughter around (never see her in the book) and creating some irrelevant melodrama about romance with her editor (she is a writer) and ambitions about writing some irrelevant story about radiologists.

This is one of the worst novel-to-screenplay conversions I've ever seen.  I realize it was the mid-1990s and you couldn't make a McDonalds commercial without throwing in a legal twist at the end...but for no reason whatsoever, we have a writer playing lawyer/detective and the whole thing actually culminates in a makeshift courtroom drama.

Not to mention, the climax of the screenplay version hinges on the herpes virus of all plot devices - repressed memories!  Wait, it's coming back to me...  Oh my goodness, now I remember!

I also got the impression that John C. Reilly spent about half an hour ""perfecting"" his Maine accent, and both he and Kathy Bates subscribed to the Kevin Costner ""whenever I feel like it"" school of accent consistency.

I agree with all the other reviewers, this movie should have recieved multiple Oscars- Best Music Score, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Motion Picture for 1995.

It has a story, not just a plot, to tell. The characters tell it well. And perhaps these characters might seem too tough or ""darth vadar like"" for some, but I enjoyed them--do what you have to do and don't whine. I like that. But it was just a climax or a a turning point that kept you interested . . . there were several . . . no not in a manipulative way . . . just the way the one story unfolded itself. It was great. Unique. However, whether Stephen King or the person who wrote the screen adaptation (was it King, himself??? dunno), someone couldn't resist interjecting some politics in a few highlighted spots. I am not a fan of victim complexes and while I understand why there was a women's movement, hating men and thinking it is woman vs man is a huge turn off for one and kinda borders victim hood, when these characters are anything but victims. So if it hadn't been for this part I would have given this movie 5 stars. Kathy Bates owes her career to Stephen King, and perhaps vice versa. But all the characters were excellent executed by their respective actors. Perhaps if this movie had been advertised back when it came out a little more interestingly instead of in the weird way it was (I remember it looked ""blue"") it might have gotten a better reception at the box office.",1324684800,2,1556,4.313993174061434

32159,5,0780622383,"""Dolores Clairborne"" is an excellent film, a film that should have won a slew of Oscar nominations and awards, but somehow got lost during the eligibilty period. Kathy Bates, who plays the title role, has gone on record as saying her work in this film is the best she has ever done.
 ""Dolores Clairborne"", filmed in Nova Scotia, Canada,(not too far from where I reside) is about a hard-working woman living with an alcoholic, whose is abusive both physically and mentally. They share a daughter who is extremely intelligent. Dolores' dream is to get her daughter off the small island in which they live to some place far better. Dolores works for the wealthy Vera Donovan, the richest woman on Little Tall Island. Vera pays Dolores the lousy sum of $40.00 a week to keep her mansion in immaculate perfection. The money in which Dolores saves is for her daughter's college fund.
 The film is mainly about three woman, Dolores, her daughter Selena, and Vera, and the intangled lives they lead, along with their secrets and lies that eventually come out. Taylor Hackford, who directed the movie, wanted to make a ""woman's picture"" and he succeeded. Although the main character in the film is Dolores, we soon see how her life is intermingled with that of her child and employer. The bulk of the film concerns the death of Dolores' husband and the mystery surrounding that death.
 The performances in this blockbuster are the best that a movie can attain. Kathy is outstanding, Jennifer Jason Leigh who plays the adult Selena is mesmerizing, and Judy Parfitt, who plays Vera, steals the movie with her bitchy and autocratic sense of timing.

32166,4,0780622383,"If you're expecting another `Misery' then you should walk away from this right now.  While the main components may be the same (Steven King source; Kathy Bates performance) the end result couldn't be more different.  This doesn't feel much like a horror movie as much as a psychological thriller, but that really shouldn't repel anyone from this great film.  You just have to know what you are in for.  So, I'll rephrase my opening statement.

If you're expecting another `Misery' then you should wipe away all expectations and soak in this film for what it is and not what you think it is supposed to be.

`Dolores Claiborne' tells the story of Dolores, a middle-aged woman working as a housekeeper in Maine.  When her employer Vera winds up dead and Claiborne is found standing over her dead body with a weapon in hand it is only expected that she would wind up being the prime suspect.  Dolores's grown daughter Selena, now working as a journalist, comes to see her mother during the investigation.  They haven't spoken in years, and their reunion only stirs up awful memories of Selena's childhood and her father Joe who wound up dead when she was still quite young.  Her mother was prime suspect at the time, but lack of evidence kept her from behind bars.  The Detective who worked Joe's murder case is also working Vera's and his grudge against Dolores is what may wind up bringing closure to both these deaths.

The storytelling here is amazing, for the film flows like a well written novel in that it manages to flesh out each and every scene.  Sure, it could have been tightened in a few areas, but for the most part it is very fluid in its delivery.

The real showcase here though is the acting.  Kathy Bates is stellar as Dolores, delivering an award worthy performance that is the stark opposite of her Oscar winning turn in `Misery'.  She is calm and reclusive and very guarded, but her inner suffering is boiling right under her skin.  Judy Parfitt is also quite wonderful as Vera, Dolores's strong willed employer.  Christopher Plummer is always outstanding, and his gruff delivery here brings his stock character to another level; and David Strathairn is unforgettable as the sadistic Joe.  A lot of praise is heaped up Jennifer Jason Leigh in general.  Many people consider her this amazing actress who is Oscar snubbed over and over but I can't really find a reason to consider her all that noteworthy.  Everything I've seen of her has been decent at best, this performance included.  I found her serviceable, and at times she was great, but nothing extraordinary, and nothing that most other actresses couldn't pull off.

I wish that the film had been a little more intense, I will say that.  The film flows almost so serenely that it lacks any real bite.  This isn't a horrible thing, but it takes a little away from the end result.  When the revelations were revealed it didn't feel so shocking or spine chilling because I felt numbed over by the films fluidity.  It's a small gripe when you look at the big picture, but it's a gripe none-the-less.  All in all though, `Dolores Claiborne' is a great film that is sure to satisfy any fan of the genre, the writer or the star.",1221782400,,3196,4.6589285714285715

For me, ultimately, the film is about what lengths a mother will go through to help her daughter. Even if it meant the loss of that primary relationship, Dolores does what she thinks is necessary to protect her daughter. This is the love story.
  Kathy Bates has never fit into a character so well, and the editing, creative melding of the past and the present, provides a compelling, gritty ground for the drama. Love between women is rarely dramatized as well as it was in this film.
  The men are superfluous, and riveting in their contempt for the female characters. This movie is extremely powerful, provocative, and evocative. Ultimately, I believe the movie was not formally recognized by the Hollywood community because they simply could not handle the subject matter.

When you can see people you have known in the characters, that means this was a convincing movie and seemed very real.  Cathy Bates deserved an Oscar for her performance in this; she has never been better.  Was surprised this was based on a Stephen King novel, as I don't care much for most of his work in the horror genre.  Of course this not a horror movie.  There are a couple of ""uncomfortable"" scenes that you might not want your younger ones seeing, since part of the plot involves sexual child abuse (father and daughter).  The weakest person in the movie was Jennifer Jason Leigh, but it seems to me that she did a more than passable job in her role.  Could there have been someone better than her?  Maybe, but they could have easily picked someone who couldn't handle that role as well as Leigh did. Judy Parfitt as the aging, sick Vera also did an outstanding job.

32192,4,0780622383,"This film is an adaptation of a Stephen Kings novel of the same title and among with ""Stand By Me"" and ""Dead Zone"" is one of my favorite films based on the master of horrors' writings. Ironically, all three books (and the movies) don't belong to horror genre. They are the combination of many genres, including crime, drama, and thriller. ""Dolores Claiborne"" which is the story told by its main character explores many difficult subjects - failed marriages that result in dysfunctional families, relationship between a mother and a daughter and how far would a mother go to protect her child.

Dolores Claiborne works for many years as a maid for wealthy and demanding Vera Donovan and after Vera's suspicious death is accused of murdering her employer. Det. John Mackey (Christopher Plumber), the shrewd investigator is absolutely sure that Dolores not only murdered Vera who left her a fortune but is also guilty of murdering her husband many years ago but never was charged for that crime. Dolores's daughter Selena (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a successful reporter who had not talked to her mother for years comes from New York City to cover the story. Who is Dolores - a greedy monster and a murderer or an unhappy woman for whom an accident is sometimes a best friend? Kathy Bates received the Oscar for her portrayal of a psychotic nurse in another King's adaptation, ""Misery"" but I believe that Dolores Claiborne is her best role. She carries the film and I don't think that any other actress could fit the part as well as Bates did which brings the question - maybe King wrote the book with her in mind, who knows? Judy Parfitt is extremely well cast as Vera Donovan, an arrogant ice queen, who was capable of understanding and care for Dolores and her daughter and who knew too well about loneliness and despair.

However I was unconvinced by Jennifer Jason Leigh's portrayal of Dolores' daughter, the role required more nuance.

All together, though, this is a terrific story of revenge.  If you think there's no such thing as justifiable homicide, this film will give you pause to reconsider.  The sequence during which Dolores' husband (Strathairn) gets his comeuppance during a solar eclipse is cinematic glory.

(bates) who is accused of murder for the second time, first it was her husband, then her employer (Vira Donovon) who she had worked for for many years and then became her caregiver. It's a myserty/drama and a very enjoyable film even though there are some dark moments when Dolores is having flashbacks of her alcoholic abusive husband, and her daughter who she tried to protect. Vira Donovon makes the movie special because not only is her acting oscar worthy but her character is very likeable even though she appears to be a rich bitch at the beginning, but as you get to know her character you realize she's a good person, but just doesn't take crap from anyone. So is dolores claiborne, and it's really about women. How women are treated and these two women became such good friends because not only were they alike, but they had some similar problems. It's about friendship, female bonding, and what can i say GIRLPOWER! Being tough, but doing what's right. Being a good person but learning from your mistakes. Looking out for yourself, but help others every once and a while. And never judge a book by it's cover. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays selena st george, dolores's daughter who has emotional problems and is unstable but we all find out why. This movie is underated. Maybe many of you think it's about hating men, but not really. It just focus's on women and their strength and weaknesses, and sometimes doing the wrong thing for the right reason. Dolore's husband is suppose to be an unpleasant character and you can't help but not like him at all. And everyone has the right to defend themselves and their children. No one should take that. And even if you provoke someone, you can't make anyone do anything they don't wanna do. Bottom line is, self defense is self defense. It reminds me of EYE FOR AN EYE with sally field. In real life, Cops can set up a sting, and go undercover and provoke people, but if you commit a crime you go to jail. You're responsible for your own actions. If someone intends to do you bodily harm, you have the right to defend yourself, and your children. It's justifiable homicide. This movie, dolores claiborne is thought provoking, and focus's on some important issue's. It's just a movie and it can make you feel good because no woman should ever have to accept a husband like joe. That isn't love, and it sickens me that women protect their husbands no matter what they do to your kids or them, but no one should let that happen.

32219,5,0780622383,"Delores Claiborne (Kathy Bates) is a long-suffering (but still a strong, feisty) woman who is accused of murdering a woman she worked for in the past, and her estranged daughter, a reporter named Selena (Jennifer Jason Leigh) hears about the news, and as a result, is reunited with her mother to find out the truth. The reunion of the two causes both to reexamine past traumas that possibly should have been faced and expurgated ages ago, and as these painful memories are brought to the surface, things are never quite the same between the two -- especially for Selena, who seemed to have forgotten -- and/or wished she had forgotten certain experiences, which have caused her to become a somewhat closed-off, pill-popping woman who clearly seemed to have been suffering from some underlying psychologial issues.
While Delores is being accused of the current murder of her employer, a detective played by Christopher Plummer takes the case, and doggedly harasses Dolores, as he stubbornly adheres to the everlasting belief that she also murdered her husband in the past.
While based on a Stephen King novel, I'm strongly hesitant to tag this movie a horror flick as many others do in other places. Instead, I call this a mystery/suspense/drama. The dialogue is fairly complex, as many layers are uncovered regarding the psychological natures of Delores, Selena and other characters. As the scenes, dialogue and time progress, more and more things seem to unravel, up until the very end, when two disturbingly primal events are uncovered: one regarding Delores, and the other regarding Selena. From there, the story takes an unpredictable twist (which I will not reveal), but it's quite revelatory in how it all connects.
Kathy Bates shines here as the foul-mouthed, spunky woman who bears the least amount of shame with her personality, and it doesn't seem like much of a stretch for Kathy herself. Jennifer Jason Leigh excellently and convincingly portrays the beautiful, intriguing, yet troubled and vulnerable Selena. The scenes which take place in New England (as to be expected from S. King), maintain an atmospheric presence throughout the movie, as the events of the present feature landscapes shot in a beautifully melancholic, fog-like, autumnal blue shade, while the past events feature landscapes shot in a burnt orange color, which can only be comparable to that of a mid-autumn leaf. Pretty ironic, but it works quite well. Both aspects of this technique add an extra amount of depth and sincerity to the story. Also worth noting are what seem like New England accents, used by Kathy Bates (and selected others), which help to give the characters a homebred authenticity.
A film that possibly deserves more credit than it gets. Excellent story, excellent acting, excellent atmospherics and excellently written, I don't think I can name many (if any) flaws in this film. I highly enjoy this film. Recommended.",1059264000,6,2922,5.115062761506276
32220,5,0780622383,"Unlike some of King's works, which have been major yawners when filmed for tv or the big screen, ""Dolores Claiborne"" is an artfully done, intriguing film.  Kathy Bates portrays the title character, a hard-working, much put-up woman who still has spunk and self-respect.
  Jennifer Jason Leigh, in the role of her alienated, substance-abusing daughter Selina, does a good job showing us her journey from
avoiding her mother, to embracing and understanding her.
  King is in familiar territory here, writing about  the island off the coast of Maine where the action takes place, a cool, green yet granite-hard piece of earth, where sometimes people's hearts can get as hard as that rock.  The movie's flashbacks
show us what has brought Dolores and her Selina to their estrangement, and the satisfying denouement reunites them.  Highly recommended.",1057190400,2,846,5.2611940298507465

She has a nack of getting you into her character and feeling like you were there.  The story never has a dull moment up to the very end.  As usual she does a supurb job as well as Jennifer Jason Leigh, and the rest of the cast.
It is a fantastic story of a woman whom is abused and ends up working for a very mean spirited rich woman as her maid, then care taker plus what all of this does to her daughter growing up.  I don't want to give to much away, so see the movie.

When I first saw this film, I thought Kathy Bates had walked away with the Oscar for 1995 before she even set foot on the stage.  Her Delores is such a beautifully, touchingly, crustily complex character that she just pops off the screen at you.  And the writing has some of the best dialogue in years which still holds up.
The entire casting for this film was done beautifully.  Leigh is typically intense, but does a nice turn as the victim of abuse (no shrinking violet here).  And the character of Vera is just magic in her diabolical sweetness.
King crafts one of his finest works with this film, and the cinematography is breathtaking, not losing it's beauty on the small screen which is very difficult with this transition.

The movie is about a Maine woman (Kathy Bates) who is being convicted of murdering her employer (Judy Parfitt). Jennifer Jason Lee plays as her estranged daughter Selena who comes home to help her mom prove she didn't commit the alleged crime. The movie is very serious and powerful, and not as bloody as most Stephen King films, but still quite gripping. The film has absolutly no humor or comedy. It's all serious and moving. The acting is very realistic. David Strathairn is horribly perfect as the no-good scumbag husband.

32238,5,0780622383,"Dolores Clairborne is one of the best American films of recent years, and certainly one the most underlooked and underrated films.
The film has it all: a dark thriller a domestic tragedy, story about friendships,about psychological traumas, about revenge and obsessions, with each character brilliantly written and developed.
Jennifer Jason Leigh, Judy Parfitt, David Strathain and Christopher Plummer give very powerful performances, but the film goes to Kathy Bates, who is simply the best working actress in the US. Her presence is just mesmerizing, and as much as her performance in Misery and Fried Green Tomatoes.. was brilliant, in Dolores Claiborne she really excels!!
The film is over two hours, but the moment it opens, with an excellent haunting score by Danny Elfman,you will be transported on a dark journey that touches your heart, mind and soul and it will seem like few minutes have passed, after reading the end credits.
Hackford's CV was 'studio' oriented to say the least, but in Dolores Clairborne, you discover an artist, who is capable of offering his viewer an intimate story with a lot of sensitivity.
The visual transition between present and past which happens quite often, is very original, and adds to the power of the story.
The DVD, although short on the extras, it has a very pleasent and unique surprise..a audio commentary by Hackford..Not on selected or deleted scenes (which directors nowadays deliberately include in DVDs to enhance the extras), but throughtout the whole film, scene by scene, recorded four years after its theatrical release!! which gives a lot of insight into the making of Dolores Clairborne, and it is as interesting to hear as watching the film.
So Dolores Clairborne is a prime example of very talented people, offering their art with love to every cinema lover in the world. It is a MUST buy and should be added to your collection.",1024358400,5,1891,5.044728434504792

Jennifer Jason Leigh deserved at least a nomination for her portrayal of Selena, Dolores' daughter.
 Not a ""horror"" movie of the typical King sorts, but certainly a phenomenal look into the gut-wrenching pits of human hearts. If you liked Misery, this will be a divine gift to you.",1023667200,,503,4.715909090909091

Oscars should have gone to director Taylor Hackford, the cinematographer, Danny Elfman's haunting score, and the acting, oh my.  Of course, Kathy Bates is overwhelming; Jennifer Jason Leigh has never been better; Christopher Plummer certainly sheds his ""Sound of Music"" persona; Judy Parfit is unbelievably effective as bitchy Vera, but her portrayal is so dimensional that we come to care for her; Ms. Parfit's scene with the pig musicbox playing ""Happy Days Are Here Again"" is brilliant.  Also superb is Ellen Muth, who plays the young Selena, and John Reilly as the sheriff, who stands up to Plummer's state detective.  Of course, one can't overlook David Straitharn as Dolores' cruel and abusive husband.  His performance is so convincing that I don't think I'll like him in anything!  My only regret is I didn't see this one earlier.  Can we go back and do the 1995 Oscars over??

32243,5,0780622383,"Dolores Claiborne is a difficult film to pull off, because the story shifts between past and present.  Yet director Taylor Hackford manages to weave the various time frames together with such success and style.  A formidable Kathy Bates stars as the title character, a woman being investigated for the murder of her elderly employer.  The detective on the case, Christopher Plummer, wants to get her because years earlier he investigated her for the murder of her husband, but was not able to make anything stick.  Her long estranged daughter, Jennifer Jason Leigh, shows up, a woman on the edge who suspects her mother is guilty of both crimes.  As the investigation develops, the story of Dolores, her abusive husband, and her daughter is reminisced about, so that the truth and family secrets can come out.  This is a gripping film with a great visual style.  The present time sequences are filmed in washed out colours, very grey and pale blue, while the sequences from the past are photographed with vivid colours, as if the past is more alive than the present.  The climax of the film when we learn the truth of all that happened is particularly stunning and beautiful.  The performances are uniformly excellent and forceful, with Bates and the writer creating an original, unforgettable ""heroine"".

32244,5,0780622383,"Whilst Stephen King is perhaps most famous for his horror novels such as 'The Shining' and 'Carrie', his subtler pieces are equally as good, such as 'Rita Hayworth And The Shawshank Redemption' and 'Dolores Claiborne'.  Right from the very start the audience is utterly gripped as we see Dolores (Kathy Bates) hovering over her employer (Parfit) with a rolling pin.  From then we go forward to the police investigator fronting the investigation into what happened in that house, trying to eke out his revenge for the death of Dolores's husband which he belives she had a part in, and we see Dolores's estranged daughter Selena return (Leigh).
What follows are a series of flashbacks and real-time footage until we get the full picture of Dolores's relationship with employer Vera, why Selena left all those years ago and what really happened with her husband.  Never has cinematography been used to such a level of excellence as it is in the finale, which uses a stunning solar eclipse as its backdrop.  The dreary setting of the present is also contrasted with the brighter, more colourful photography used to show Selena's childhood.
The performances all round as spot on, although its the three leading ladies that really give an impression.  Kathy Bates as the resilient Dolores gives a performance every bit as good as she did in 'Misery', Jennifer Jason Leigh's just-about-to-crack Selena is utterly compelling and Judy Parfit (who other than this I've only seen playing Lizzie's mother in 'ER') as the snobbish rich woman is especially brilliant as the audience watches her gradually decay.  More importantly, this doesn't go down the road of a feminist drama.  Although admitedly there are feminist aspects to the movie, its the jealousy, self-loathing and hopelessness that really drives these women.  I can't praise this movie enough.",1011916800,4,1844,5.102990033222591
32245,5,0780622383,"This is one of the greatest films of the past 10 years, due in large measure to the acting performances of Bates and Jason-Leigh. It's a low-key drama. But that's OK. For the viewers who are tired of juvenile special effects, and paper-thin plots, this is a welcome change of pace. There's actually a story to appreciate, though it's a heart-breaking one. We're witnessing the emotional distance between Dolores and her hurt and resentful, adult daughter. It's not a pleasant experience. But we're made to care about these characters. As the story unfolds, and we learn delicate secrets from 15 years before, the film never bores us with silly side plots, or meaningless gimmicks.
Instead, the emphasis is on failed relationships, and missed opportunities. Dolores puts up  - temporarily, anyway - with the abuse of her sadistic, self-indulgent husband. Her hands are shriveled, from endless hours, and years, of cleaning her employer's mansion of a house. Do they hate each other? Or is there actually a bond which we can't initially see? Dolores has a tenuous connection with her daughter, who grudgingly travels up to coastal Maine, from Manhattan, to somehow lend support to a mother she hasn't seen in 15 years -- who's ready to be charged with murder. It's a complicated, but intriguing tale which kept me riveted to this movie, wondering how it was all going to develop, and end. I wasn't disappointed.
One quibble: While I really admire it, I'm a little dismayed by one aspect of the film. Each time I've seen it, I've appreciated not only the acting and the script, but the fact that it takes place on the coast of Maine. Over the last few years, I've been overwhelmed by the beauty of that place, and enjoy seeing it portrayed on the screen. (e.g. ""The Man Without A Face""; ""In The Bedroom"".) That's what I thought was the case with ""Dolores Claiborne"". But, according to the credits which follow the film, the whole thing was actually filmed in Nova Scotia. It doesn't take away from film's dramatic power. But I still feel it should have been filmed in Maine, as implied by the script.

32247,4,0780622383,"It is a cold, bitter world that sets the stage for ""Dolores Claiborne""--a deep-seated cold that is reflected in the bleak winter landscape. Nowhere is the Hollywood lighting, the softening perfection of characters too beautiful to be real. Nor is there the epic drama of a tragedy that is larger than life. The story is small, concerning one family, and the characters are ordinary people. Yet the depth and intensity of this film is unmatched, perhaps even heightened by its narrow focus.

Cold is the feeling one gets from the film...The chill between mother and daughter, the truths frozen behind a protective shield. The film is structured in such a way that only pieces of the truth are revealed, a bit at a time, and each piece more ugly than the last. Therein is the genius of the story's structure: it is almost unbearably ugly until the last piece has fallen into place, and then it becomes apparent that the ugly truth is dazzling; it is harsh, cruel, yet at the same time incredibly beautiful. During the entire film this beauty is never articulated until one point near the end; ironically that moment is its one weak link.
 The acting can hardly be called acting; the artists live their roles to such a degree that they deserve the name. Jennifer Jason Leigh is haunted and haunting as Dolores's daughter,her brittle exterior a mask for deep suffering, her pain consuming her from within. Kathy Bates is so much the character she plays that it is impossible to think of her as an actress. For the genius she brings to this role, she deserves ten oscars.
 This is recommended to anyone who looks for something deeper than standard Hollywood fare: the story centers on the complexity of human relationships, the underlying beauty of even the deepest darkness. Truly a masterpiece.",1006387200,11,1791,4.808441558441558
32248,5,0780622383,"Here's the premise of Dolores Claiborne: it sucks to be a woman trapped in an abusive relationship, with no escape route and no earning power.
Duh.
It quite amazes me how women, shouting something for decades, provoke no more response than ""Yes, Dears,"" while one man, saying it once, gets everyone's attention. Quite a lot of this film is predictable as a bowl of Wheaties; neck-breaking suspense comes from wondering if these people will ever figure themselves out. Will Dolores realize her daughter is angry because she simply doesn't remember that her father molested her?-- oh, now I've gone and given away the rest of the plot. Well nevermind. Will Selena realize that psychiatrists are like gods-- the fewer the better? This film is so like having coffee with a dear friend.
Altogether, you need to see this film. Kathy Bates is so good, I'm mailed her an oat bran muffin, a bottle of vitamins, and a nice warm scarf. I want her happy and healthy, and making films for many years to come. She plays Dolores at two different ages, and yeah, she wears a little face make-up, and some hair-grey, but it's all barely necessarily, because she uses her body to tell us what time it is. We see Dolores sustain a back injury, and the Dolores everafter turns her whole body, and her neck only a little to look sideways; the young, uninjured Dolores turns from the waist with full neck movement. Details like this make you want to go back to the videostore and tell the salesclerk she undercharged you. Julia Roberts and Leonardo DiCaprio do not think of things like this. Oh, and she's got a character voice too. I was giggling and clapping my hands in joy like a damm Britney Spears fan.
Jennifer Jason Leigh isn't of the same calibre as Kathy Bates, but she's still darned good, and at least she's willing to play unattractive characters, and play them to the hilt. She's a perfect foil for Bates, because she forces the audience to appreciate the depth of Dolores' maternal feelings; Selena is plain nasty, so Dolores is certainly not making sacrifices because Selena has such a delightful personality, or treats her with such respect.
Even if you don't watch the film, buy it, and buy it new; let filmmakers know that a film without a car chase or a woman in a halter-top still sells. Please.",1004659200,5,2294,4.666666666666667

32250,5,0780622383," Dolores Claiborne  is one of the most beautiful book by Stephen King. But the film, in spite of all the shortcuts it has to use, is even better because of one actress, Kathy Bates. She does not act. She lives on the screen, and that is so rare that it gives to the film the poignancy of real life. It is a rare story too. The story of three women and one man. The mother first who suffers everything for her daughter. She suffers the molesting for her husband because he is the father of her daughter. But yet she gets one day to the point where she can't stand it any more and she puts a stop to it, though it does not change much, except maybe that it makes this father  become bent onto vengeance. The daughter who is the apple of the eye of her mother and she is blind to the mistreatment of her mother because she is in love with her father. In love forever, even when this love is exploited by the father to turn the daughter into a surrogate of his wife. She will forget it, full stop, period and that will be all. Till the day she finally remembers. Finally the boss, Vera, a domineering woman who exploits Dolores as if she were a house slave. And yet it is a love story too, the love story of two women who were neglected and wounded by their husbands, the love of two women who managed to cause an accident to get rid of their husbands. The love of two women that are so much alike and yet so different that they are perfect doubles, braindoubles, just like we have bodydoubles in the cinema. The father is limited in his brain. He is an alcoholic. He is his own daughter's molester. Then the story is that of the coming back of the memory in the daughter's head eighteen years later. It is the story of several knots in the mental plots that the lives of these three women are. Vera finally commits suicide because her getting old makes her hate life and become so bitchy that it is unbearable even for herself. Vera begs for Dolores to finish her up and Dolores accepts though she is too late and she cannot perform. Yet this is the prompter of another desire for vengeance in the main inspector of the island who was not able to have Dolores indicted for the death of her husband. And the whole film becomes the defeat of this old vengeful and hateful detective who cannot see human feelings and human actions but through the narrowing glass of his hatred. This trio of women is a rare situation in Stephen King's books, maybe the only one. It is a lot deeper than the women portraits we have in  The Tommyknockers . It is deeper because it is only human, with no special effects and no aliens. Just plain human beings with their emotions, their fears and their hopes. And Kathy Bates transcend the plot to make it nothing but a voyage into real life. And it is real life indeed. Not a real life we dream of, but a real life we carry in our memory and in our deepest impulses. We know we would do the same thing if we were in those very same situations. And those situations occur everyday in our world. A thrilling psychological journey into the humanity of women for whom death has the taste of life and life the taste of torture.

After being accused of murder Dolores' daughter, Selena, is summoned to her aid by a mysterious fax, the origins of which are left open to interpretation.  Playing Selena if Jennifer Jason Leigh who gives her typical powerhouse performance but tackles it with a less heavy-handed approach.

The one exception is Dolores' husband whose death was deemed an accident but he believes otherwise.  The story unfolds like a finely layered film noir.  David Strathairn (here we go again) brings a human touch to the abusive husband who could've fallen into the typical sterotype of film villians in less suitable hands.  As you might of guessed the cast is nothing short of a marvel to watch and are helped immeasurably by Hackford's inventive and visually stunning direction.  Scribe Tony Gilroy has crafted one of the finest adaptations of ANY novel, showing restraint and sensitivity in downplaying some of the cheesier moments from the book.  In doing so he shows respect to the subject matter and maintains the engrossingly steady pace of the film.

32253,5,0780622383,"Setting the tone for Stephen King's first-person narrative of murder and suspense, ""Dolores Claiborne"" begins with the title character's  integrity becoming questionable as she holds a rolling pin high above her  head at the foot of a banister, ready to strike. At her feet bloody and  broken lies Vera Donovan, the mistress of the house and her employer of  over 20 years. She is on the brink of death and holds Dolores' perturbed  gaze, pleading with her as the neighborhood mailman walks in the house with  a satchel full of envelopes and, along with the audience, makes the  horrible assumption that Dolores has just committed a vile and immoral act.  From this abrupt and climactic scene, a visual and psychological  masterpiece blooms from the unique and aesthetic interpretation of a  fledgling director, giving King's quirky but engaging yarn about a  tough-as-nails New Englander an authentic and absorbing  effervescence.
When King began penning his tale of a hard-luck Maine  woman with a dark past, his mind was on Kathy Bates, the actress who  delivered a disconcerting representation of an obsessive fan in 1990's  horror hit ""Misery"". Her volatile and freakish performance  merited her an Oscar for Best Actress, gaining King's favor and securing  another spotlight role for her in his next adaptation. She has proven  herself to be a theatrical powerhouse once more as the austere and brazen  Dolores, a woman whose sympathetic spirit has stiffened from enduring  countless catastrophes in the course of her toilsome existence. Bates is a  formidable talent but her fellow cast members are impressive  notwithstanding. Jennifer Jason Leigh is straightforward and affecting as  Selena, Dolores' estranged and embittered daughter. She plays the skeptical  and begrudged bit effectively, adjoining savage and repressed emotion to  match her lank and pallid appearance. Christopher Plummer as the dogged  detective John Mackey is the perfect contrareity of courtly manner and  gritty resolve, his refined forte as an actor a befitting blend to this  generation's turnout of talented thespians. Last but not least, Judy  Parfitt makes the icy and callous Vera Donovan believably sympathetic,  bringing to light an understanding for her rigid nature as the audience  becomes acquainted with every character and Dolores' established pasts with  them. Vera may seem harsh, but she is nowhere in the bounds of being as  despicable as Joe, Dolores' abusive and alcoholic husband. David Strathairn  was surprisingly convincing as the contemptuous and simple-minded boozer,  an insecure and self-destructive man who finds his comfort in his stature  as a stone-hard wifebeater. Stephen King writes his characters well,  absorbing either his reader or his viewer into their worlds, and there are  powerful moments for each of them in this two-hour character study.
Two  moments that strike me the most are, first and foremost, a prolonged frame  of the dilapidated house upon the island in the last winks of daylight as  the evening consumes the earth. A thick and cloudy crimson sky swallows the  dark and crumbling property that is singularly lit by an ominous, ghostly  blue light on the porch. If one were to pause the film at this exact  moment, they would feel as if they were looking at the eerie and  mesmerizing cover art intended for this very novel. Another is the  arresting moment when Selena recollects the enervating sexual abuse from  her father while riding upon the local ferry. She envisions herself and Joe  sitting upon a bench, Joe taking her numb hands and pulling them toward his  lap. Her brow is furrowed and she is whimpering with pain and resistance as  she casts her eyes down to the floor, fighting tears. When she looks back  up, she fixes her gaze this time directly to the camera and her face  smoothes to a neutral expression, blank and emotionless. You know at this  moment there is a complete detachment, one she has unwillingly mastered  throughout the years to cleverly disguise her burgeoning agony. Credit must  also be given to Taylor Hackford for the ingeniously devised method of  blending past and present with consistent and numerous flashbacks that take  place throughout the film. The dull and grayish palettes are literally  wiped over with full and vibrant technicolor memories that create a  comprehensive separation between the past and the here and now.
King has  always been an incredible writer, but this is the first time that a film  has ever surpassed the novel that birthed it. Leave it to Kathy Bates to  steal the prize, but it is a welcome theft for the justice she gave to  ""Misery"". ""Dolores Claiborne"" is a screenplay well  orchestrated and brilliantly directed, the sparkling gem in the entire  library of Stephen King films.",967248000,3,4793,5.133592736705578
32254,5,0780622383,"Kathy Bates is likely the most exciting and certainly one of the most talented actresses working today.  She continually appears in excellent  films and always give a magnificent performance (that Adam Sandler fiaso  aside).  From Misery, Primary Colors, and even Titanic, to lesser known  films like The Late Shift (incredible!) which she did for HBO, Kathy Bates  consistently gives a performance which is both exciting and totally  believable.  While she does not fit the stereotypical definition of a  Hollywood beauty, her ability to transform herself both physically and  emotionally for each role is amazing.
Dolores Claiborne is a great film,  beautifully shot and wonderfully acted.  Bates is magnificent, Jennifer  Jason Leigh is convincing in her role as Dolores' daughter, and Christopher  Plummer gives a subtle yet powerful performance as the police investigator  who's one professional failure has been to convict Claiborne of the murder  of her husband.  The film is shot with great care.  The scene near the end  which takes place at the height of a solar eclipse is absolutely  mesmerizing.  The story moves along with a great pace, and keeps the  interest of the viewer throughout.  This is really an excellent film, and  one that has unfortunately been overlooked by many people.",965952000,,1299,5.254901960784314

I often wonder why actresses as good as Bates are not  given enough roles while brainless, waifs littered the television screens.  Anyway, don't get me started on politics of America. I feel this is a movie  for any woman who has been abused or can relate to how women are viewed and  treated in a male dominated society. It seems atleast in the movie that  women finally get justice for once instead of being on the other end of the  rope. If you like a great thriller then watch this.

Led by much-deserving Oscar winner Kathy Bates and a sullen and moody Jennifer  Jason Leigh, the cast brings to life several characters trapped in a story  of denial, repression, and ultimately, the strength that women must have to  endure life.
This film has been overlooked by many people, including  myself, for many reasons. Kathy Bates in another Stephen King story seemed  to repetitive from her amazing performance in ""Misery"". But fair  warning, she is not Nurse Annie here, but a completely amazing and hard  woman who deals with the trauma in her life head on. I also didn't  appreciate the magical artistry of this film until buying the DVD and  listening to Taylor Hackford give his wordy and brilliant commentary to the  film.

32258,5,0780622383,"Oscar Winner Kathy Bates really deserved another for her riveting portrait of Stephen King's title character in this most satisfying film on all levels. She is dynamic as a woman coping with demons of her past and present as she tries to make a bond with her estranged daughter, effectively played by Jennifer Jason Leigh. Able support is provided by the underappreciated Christopher Plummer. David Straithairn is also outstanding as Bates' thoroughly heinous husband.
But the real surprise is Judy Parfitt, a less-familiar name, who makes her mark as Dolores's employer. Parfitt's transformation from elegant rich matron to feeble invalid is remarkable. Brilliant is an understatement.
Finally, the film's color and locations are truly enthralling. It makes the viewer want to relocate to New England, not just for a vacation, but for a lifetime.

You have to read the book to know what she has to endure. The movie is more concentrated on her own family and her daughter who comes back to help her mother when Vera dies under suspicous  curcomstances. You see what led to this death through flash backs. The best  scene of the movie is when Dolores cries and Vera tells her she cant help  because all her money is in stocks etc. But when Dolores tells what has  happened than Vera, for once turns her cold and icy heart into  understanding for Dolores and gives her advice.

We get an insight into Dolores's past as her drunken,  foul-mouthed husband belittles her and hits her.  Too upset with all this  Dolores plans a murder that looks to be accidental.

Bates outdoes herself as Claiborne, surpassing her role as Wilkes in ""Misery"". Critics have said Bates was  trying to cash in on the success of Misery by playing Dolores  Claiborne,what are they thinking. This film and its characters have so much  depth and detail it just can't be compared to another work. The direction  and cinematography are hauntingly beautiful,a mood is set in this film  rarely tapped into just by the scenery. Set in Maine, the dark and moody  tale by the ocean suits the script, spooky. This is a much overlooked and  underappreciated film which I would rank Masterpiece. It intriques the  viewer and sends chills without gore. Just a good old plain fashion murder  mystery, Hollywood should sit up and take note off this work, that a film  can be superior without special effects, all it needs is a good script and  Kathy Bates...",953596800,21,957,4.733333333333333

Kathy Bates, Jennifer Jason Leigh and  the actress who plays Vera (Don't know her name!) MAKE this film.  Poor  David Straithairn is terrific too, but the women's perfs are so dominant,  you have to remember to notice him!  It is an almost mystical portrayal of  how life can be for women, and the secrets that women guard for each other  in their world.

32266,4,0780622383,"Let me admit this: I have never read the book and I probably never will, as I am not much of a Stephen King fan. Therefore I may not have the same view on this film, as those of you who have.
Dolores Claiborne, as a  movie, is surprisingly well made. I have no doubt that this is Taylor  Hackford's best film yet. I am especially impressed with the visual effects  he used, during the flashbacks. He paints a vivid picture of the world of  Dolores Claiborne: A world of sorrow and pain. He pulls the audience into  this world and never lets go. Thus, he brings us through Dolores'life and  make us feel her pain.
Another great thing about this film, is the  acting. Kathy Bate's is as usual brilliant. CAN she even mess up a single  line?  Jennifer Jason Leigh plays as she is supposed to;nothing more,  nothing less. Which in itself should be considered a superb performance.  And I was also really pleased by the remarkable performance of Judy  Parfitt, the actress who plays Vera. Truly a great portrayl of a women who  is as hurt and angry as Dolores. The scene in which she reveals her  deepest, darkest secret to Dolores (you who have seen the film will know  what I am talking about) is truly one of the best scenes from a movie the  last 20 years! She should have gotten an Oscar! Plummer, as detective  Mackey is also extremely  good. Especially in the finale of the film.  Very intense!
However, I feel there is one element of this film that so  far has been largely overlooked by the other reviewers: Danny Elfman's  superb score. Indeed, this score should be considered one of the finest  EVER. Right up there with Herrmann's PSYCHO and Steiner's KING KONG. And I  seriously mean that.  Elfman's music is, perhaps more than any other  element of the film, that which creates the painfull, sadly mysterious  atmosphere of this movie. He uses an orchestra largely consistning of  strings with added piano etc. and hereby creates a cold, stark sound which  is as harsh as our lead character. Yet, he also gives us a score filled  with emotion and pain, a score which makes the audience (whether consiously  or subconsiously) more involved in the story and makes us feel closely  connected to the characters. He creates a tention, that to this day has  never been mached in any other score before or since.
Still, Dolores  Claiborne is not perfect (Which film is?). The script could have been  fairly better penned, especially the inquest scene where Dolores is being  questioned.
But overall, this is a finely crated film, which has a lot to  offer in the visual department, the acting and especially the score. Well  done Taylor Hacford and Danny Elfman!",946857600,36,2664,4.615384615384615
32267,4,0780622383,"First off; this is a much better movie than the overrated ""Misery"". The story, the acting; it all just works better. There is one ""problem"", though. -The casting of Leigh as the daughter.  Don't get me wrong; she's a brilliant actress, and she's also very good  here, but the fact that she doesn't look the least bit like Bates is a  quite irritating and distracting observation. (With some good will she may  resemble the father, Strathairn, but you have to be in a rather optimistic  mood to see it.) The perfect choice might have been Tammy Lauren, but I  guess she just wasn't a big enough star, or well known at the time. I'm  still hoping some bright casting director will see the light as well, and  put them together - now, that would make one hell of a powerhouse duo !.

Dolores Claiborne is a haunting story of a woman  unjustly accused of murder the second time around.  Well actually the first  time she was accused........no, I won't ruin it for you.  The way it is  filmed is dark with runny patches of colorful, bursting skyscapes during  the eclipse.  The spell it casts on you during this sequence is amazing.
