961106,4,6305079722,"I saw this movie on the BIG screen when I was 6, and I was under the seat most of the time back in 1958. My parents lived within a block of the movie theater; thus, you know what I  was doing at that age. The music and sound effects really added to the earie atmosphere of this movie; especially, when the beam of light melted the frogmen. The cyclops creature had me under the chair - I now know it's a hand inside the puppet - but on that BIG screen...",1058227200,9,454,3.9347826086956523
961107,5,6305079722,"I have to admit that a few things about this film disappointed me. The acting was better than expected, and the script was somewhat literate. Other than that, this was all the schlock, bad F/X I expect from films of this genre & time period. It's interesting to know that this film was released by Allied Artists, which was a studio neck-to-neck with American-International for the drive-in crowd. A-I went somewhat legit when they went with the Corman/Poe/Vincent Price movies, later the Beach Party films. Allied Artists went a different route: they picked up the options for the American release of ""epics"" like EL CID and 55 DAYS AT PEKING. (My vote goes to A-I, for sheer originality...) Enough history... This is a fun film. The special effects are absolutely laughable, my favorite being the alien saucer leaving the polar ice cap, obviously a toy being pulled up through soft wax. A previous reviewer referred to this as ""warmly corny""; I couldn't put it better. Bad sets, bad effects...and, of course, after Brett Halsey proves himself to be a hero and not a wimp, his shirt is suddenly open showing lots of manly chest-hair. What a guy! I've always liked Arthur Franz (especially in ""Monster on the Campus""). All in all, it's loads of fun for the ""bad sci-fi"" afficianado. My major disappointment with the DVD, though it has great picture & sound quality, is that it should've been in Widescreen. At the beginning, they show News Headlines declaring horrible stuff, but you could only see the middle of the headline...there was no perifery. As far as sets go, the perifery wouldn't have mattered...but no one can deny that the majestic scenes of the Arctic (few as they were) would have been awesome. Watch this, and keep all of your other guilty pleasures (beverages, junk food, etc.) handy. If you can ignore the good points of the film, the bad points will overwhelm you and entertain.",1019174400,8,1898,4.825153374233129
961108,3,6305079722,"This movie has to be viewed more than once to appreciate it. A plastic submarine in an aquarium is hard to accept but all in all this movie is a pretty enjoyable watch. An alien saucer under the polar ice cap planning the take over of earth. As for the DVD itself the quality is quite good, no extras (other than the trailer/scene selections} but a nice clean picture.",1010102400,,368,4.3478260869565215
961109,4,6305079722,"Atomic Submarine is another of those ""quintessential"" B-movies that should appeal to any student of 50s/60s B&W cheapies. The cast is a who's who of second-string stalwarts, including Tom Conway, Dick Foran, Arthur Franz, Bob Steele, Brett Halsey, and Sid Melton for good measure. The Rabin/Block effects are better than their usual, and while not always convincing are consistently imaginative. The script actually attempts to deal with Weighty Issues (pacifism), Alexander Laszlo turns in another ""spooky"" semi-electronic soundtrack, and the film actually pays off with a cool/icky monster and serviceable flying saucer. Atomic Submarine never achieves greatness, but it's never dull either (try watching the big-budget Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea and tell me which is really more entertaining).
The DVD itself is a pleasant surprise to those used to catching this on the late late show. The print used by Image is simply stunning. Aside from some occasional very light speckling, the image looks great: crisp and detailed, with good tonal values (although some of the ""underwater"" effects shots are a little flat, and stock footage shows the expected wear and grain). My VHS copy (from late-night TV) looks pathetic next to the DVD. Audio is also crisp and clear. The only thing odd I noticed is that the DVD is missing one short (40 sec.) scene (included in my TV copy) wherein Arthur Franz leaves Joi Lansing's apartment and chats briefly with a fellow swabbie while arriving at the sub base (although the DVD does include the last 10 to 15 seconds of the scene in the apartment, missing from the TV print). Other than this minor omission the movie appears to be completely intact. Chapter stops and trailer are included, but that's it for extras. (I was really hoping for a Sid Melton commentary.) All in all, another as-good-as-its-probably-ever-gonna-get release from Image. Aficionados of le films bad, buy with confidence.",999561600,13,1936,5.14920634920635
961110,5,6305079722,"I found this flick to bring back pleasant memories of when I used to watch movies like this as a child, in stark raving terror of course.  The special effects are warmly corny, and that goes for the alien too.  But I can assure you, to a 9 year old boy, this was shear horror! I highly recommend it to those who love the old black and white.",992390400,9,341,4.0
961111,4,6305079722,"This movie probably gets overlooked because of the title, which seems  incredibly dull and unimaginative for such a cool flick.  I think it should  have been called ""The Superatomic Submarine vs. the Flying  Saucer"" because that is what the movie is really about and it sounds  much more exciting.  The movie has everything a fan of 50's sci-fi B-movies  would want.  The story is a unique twist on the flying saucer theme because  this saucer can travel under water, and you get two classic sci-fi vehicles  for the price of one because this flying saucer takes on a futuristic  (remember this was the 1950's) submarine.  The parts that take place inside  the saucer are very creepy.  During these scenes, a pitch black background  and cool creepy music are used to maximum effect.  There are few funny  lines in the movie, especially the ones where the hero is talking to the  alien who, by the way, will not disappoint those who love cheesy cool  aliens in their sci-fi movies.  I have three words for B-movie fans:  SEE  IT NOW!",966729600,22,1032,4.679775280898877
961112,3,6305079722,"Ah, me - who would have guessed this movie would one day emerge into the light of day after being (apparently) submerged for years in fan-video limbo? This tidbit used to be a staple of the ""Late Late Show""  circuit - after the parents had gone to bed, the less critically demanding  kids would have *their* kind of flick to watch.
Never mind the  preposterous assumptions (like huge passenger-carrying atomic submarines  cruising under the polar ice cap!). We all tuned in for the weird  Theramin-like music and the gooey, drippy one-eyed, tentacled alien. In  fact, he looks a LOT like the ones you see on the Halloween episodes of the  Simpsons!
Long available only through specialty video outlets (at  ""special"" prices!), this is really an inexpensive trip down  memory lane for those of us who first saw it through our fingers in front  of our eyes by the flickering light of the boob tube after everyone else  had retired. It boasts a ""Who's Who"" of bit-part and character  actors of the genre, some actually effective footage *inside* the  underwater UFO, and that totally classic alien. Go on - you KNOW you want  to see it! Why ELSE did you look this one up?!?!  ;-)",915580800,14,1175,4.6911764705882355
7882281,1,6305079722,This movie is blank. I got ripped off. Trying to figure out how to return it? HELP!,1516838400,,83,3.9411764705882355
7882282,4,6305079722,"A little known 50's sci-fi flick with minimal special effects but with a kind of unique plot and storyline.  If you like corny flicks like The Crawling Eye or The Giant Claw, you'll have to add this to your collection.  My one beef with this copy is that no explanation of what NON-USA FORMAT means.  What I found out was that I could only get mine to play on my MacBook.  Our other two DVD players didn't know what to do with the CD.  And pay attention to the cover photo.  Even though the title is in English on the ad, the DVD package is in Italian. That was a surprise for me.  Fortunately, I read Latin well enough to figure out that it had an English as well as Italian language copies.",1495929600,,692,4.157894736842105
7882283,3,6305079722,this is a cold war anti commie movie hard on the propaganda. A scientist man whose father was a war hero and worked for the commander of the sub are thrown together and spend the first half of the picture at each others throats.the commander berating the scientist for being a coward and hating war.finally we discover the threat is a under water flying saucer complete with monster worm.the scientist saves the day and proves he is no coward and the commander proves he was right about the need to fight the commies..mildly entertaining,1488931200,,537,4.723404255319149
7882284,4,6305079722,It's funny how some actors have made more than one submarine movie. Arthur Franz is one of them. His other sub movie is with President Ronald Reagan in Hellcats of the Navy. When Ron & Nancy Davis met & began their life together. Neither is a great sub movie but if you collect them add this very hard to get movie to your collection. The Atomic Submarine (a term used back in the early days of nuclear subs) Tiger Shark takes on a very dangerous Flying Saucer. This movie cries remake with today's technology.,1396742400,,510,4.4361702127659575
7882285,5,6305079722,"Something smells under the ice, and it ain't whale poo! It's THE ATOMIC SUBMARINE ! This is a wonderfully earnest, corny as all-get-out science-fiction ""thriller"". Approximately 37 minutes into this unbelievably bad movie, most of the main characters are nodding off and snoozing, while waiting for the unknown ""cyclops"" to make its appearance! If you don't enjoy these atrociously bad stinkers, you'll be doing the same. On the other hand, if you're like me-an aficionado of the worst in science fiction thrillers, you'll be wide-awake and enjoying the heck out of this! The guys, or guy (more likely) in charge of the special effects, must've spent all of a $1.49 for a Revell submarine model to represent the ""United States' most advanced killer submarine-the ""Tigershark"" . I guess they used Saran wrap to represent the underwater icebergs. And don't get me started on the horrendous score used in this film.
Put it altogether, and you have a film that Ed Wood would've been envious of! Fine for the whole family - and after you show them this, you'll probably never have a ""family night at the movies"" again!",1388707200,,1113,4.925531914893617
7882286,4,6305079722,Very good SCI-FI movie for its time. I would prefer on dvd but not available. Happy with the vhs copy it was very good quality. Story about mysterious disappearances of ships. We sent our most advanced sub. to investigate and find an alien ufo.,1388534400,,244,4.568181818181818
7882287,4,6305079722,"Was (is) exactly what I thought it would be, almost a comedy. Have watched it several times already and enjoyed it every time. I have always liked these old sifi stuff, the cornery it is the better. Very good service, delivery quite fast.",1340755200,,238,4.558139534883721
7882288,4,6305079722,"I saw this as a child and it brought back good memories of the ""Creature Feature"" nights. It's special effects are not up to par with some of the better B&W B movies of that era but the story line was was great.",1314230400,,211,3.9302325581395348
7882289,1,6305079722,"I saw this movie in a theater in 1960, when I was six. What they were thinking showing it at a Saturday matinee of little kids I can't imagine, but that was before ratings. It scared the s*** out of me! That horrible one-eyed alien, and the terrible things that happen when the submarine crewmen are trying to escape! Very, very scary.",1160956800,,335,4.419354838709677
7882290,3,6305079722,"50s movie about a submarine crew that meets a large octopus like puppet living in a flying saucer who wants to take over the world. Alien creature can read minds but cannot read that the movie hero was going to shoot him. One scene has a sub worker screaming for his shipmate to rescue him from certain death.  Shipmate hears his cries and slowly wanders over to see what the problem is.  Wandering shipmate gets stuck in a thin rubber door that closes on him so he also dies.  Flying saucer can hop from galaxy to galaxy but cannot outrun a slow missle launched from a submarine.  Wooden acting, cliche filled script but still great fun!",1143158400,4,638,4.474137931034483
