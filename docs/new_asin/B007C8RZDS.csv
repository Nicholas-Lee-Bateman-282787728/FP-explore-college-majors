5076908,5,B007C8RZDS,"The Timeless Family Classics contains fifty movies on twelve discs with some of the most famous actors of all time, including Shirley Temple, Mickey Rooney, Charlie Chaplin, John Wayne, Gary Cooper, Carole Lombard, Laurel & Hardy, Danny Kaye, Bob Hope, and many other talented actors/actresses.

I have never heard of the majority of these film, but I have enjoyed all them that I have watched so far. My Dear Secretary (1949) stars a young Kirk Douglas, Laraine Day,  and Keenan Wynn. Douglas plays a best-selling novelist who hires a new beautiful secretary, who is also a fan of his. Before long the woman realizes that the novelist is nothing more than a womanizer and gambler, and she quits! He eventually goes after her and the two get married. Now there is a problem, she is also writing a novel that the publishers are interested in, but his newest novel isn't liked by anyone. The movie is hilarious, but romantic at the same time.

Wacky Taxi (1972) stars John Astin, Frank Sinatra Jr., and Jackie Gayle. In this comedy drama, John Astin is tired of his dead end job. He quits his job and buys an old Cadillac that he transforms (barely) into a taxi. He doesn't have a license to drive a taxi or to run his own business, but his family needs to the money, so he becomes a taxi driver. That is until the car is stolen. The movie is more of a drama than comedy, but John Astin gives a great performance as a hard working family man.

Beyond Tomorrow (1940) is a Christmas film that I have never heard of before, starring Harry Carey, Charles Winninger, Richard Carlson, and Maria Ouspenkaya. On Christmas Eve, three lonely and wealthy old men set up a young man and woman, who fall in love that night. The men leave and aboard a plane, but the plane crashes, killing the three men. The old men returns as ghost to find out that the young couple are about to break up. Before they can go to heaven, they must help this young couple. This is a cute Christmas movie that should be watched yearly around the holidays.

My favorite out of this set is titled Lost Honeymoon (1947) starring Franchot Tone, Anne Richards, and Tom Conway. It is about an ex-solider who is now an architect. His life is going well as he is engaged to a lovely and wealthy woman, until an English woman shows up claming to be his bride and mother of his children. It seems he had lost his memory while he was in the war and he doesn't remember marrying or fathering any children. The woman isn't really his wife or the mother of his kids. His real wife and mother had died, and this woman took her identity, so she could reunite the children with their father, but the woman is falling in love with him. This is a well written, heartbreaking romantic tale!

The other movies in this set are: Lost in the Stratosphere (1934); Freckles Comes Home (1942); The Big Chance (1933); The Iron Mask (1929; silent); Treasure of Fear (1945; That's My Baby! (1944); The Gang's All Here (1941); The Borrowers (1973); The General (1927; silent); Kid Dynamite (1943); Let's Get Tough! (1942); Swing It, Sailor! (1938); The Admiral Was a Lady (1950); A Bride for Henry (1937); Jane Eyre (1934); Run to the High Country (1974); Flying Wild (1941); The Big Trees (1952); The Medicine Man (1930); Oliver Twist (1933); Hay Foot (1942); The Little Princess (1939); Bill Cracks Down (1937); The Flying Deuces (1939); Mr. Boggs Steps Out (1938); The Inspector General (1949); The Kid (1921; silent); The Groom Wore Spurs (1951); Heading for Heavens (1947); The Hurricane Express (1932); A Farewell to Arms (1932); Gulliver's Travels (1939; animated); The Nut Farm (1935); My Favorite Brunette (1947); Fair Play (1972); Against a Crooked Sky (1975); The Racketeer (1929); Goodbye Love (1933); Adventure Island (1947); Lay That Rifle Down (1955); A Star is Born (1937); Uncle Joe (1941); Boys of the City (1940); The Lost World (1925; silent); The Time of Your Life (1948); Our Town (1940).

I had a lot of fun watching some of these timeless classics. Mill Creek Entertainment has put together a great collection of films for your entire family to enjoy. None of the movies have been digital remastered, but all of the movies that I watched seemed to have a decent picture quality to them. With Christmas only a few months away, this collection would make a great gift!

5076909,3,B007C8RZDS,"I got the movie list from the Mill Creek web site, and I'm disappointed. One one hand, this is a great set of movies. I really like them. I liked them so much that I bought them all in three previous Mill Creek 50 packs.

If this is your first Mill Creek collection, it's a 4-star collection. Or you could consider buying these three 50-packs instead. For me, the reshuffling of previous offerings drops my rating down to 3 stars.

Here is that movie list from the Mill Creek web site, with my notes:

5076935,3,B007C8RZDS,"I purchased four different DVD sets for my dad on Father's Day this year.  He and my mom are in their late eighties and love to watch movies.

There are quite a few black and white movies in this pack, which unfortunately are blurred.  Very tough to watch.  The color selections are fine but there are fewer of those than the blurry ones.  It does not have to do with the year it was filmed, it appears, as older color movies in this set are clearer than newer black and white choices.

Anyway, my folks have enjoyed the few color movies they watched but you do, in this case, get what you pay for.",1403568000,,598,4.201754385964913
