8590829,5,B0001OGVIA,"Hello!!  This anime is Great!!  You can't find episode one at any rental places because Myao gets drunk on one glass of watered down Sake!!!  I guess the moral majorist's had it pulled because of perceived underage drinking!!
  Anyways this anime is a classic!!  Good Stories and lots of laughs.  Defy the control freaks and watch it!!!  Still one of my all time favorites,  wish they made more episodes sniff, that's my only gripe.'",1287446400,,433,4.743243243243243
