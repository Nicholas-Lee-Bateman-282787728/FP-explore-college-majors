4460369,5,B004RAW4OE,"Watching this performance of Roy Buchanan in Concert is captivating. Can not help but to be taken away hypnotically by watching Mr. Buchanan's techinique as he creates these outstanding sounds from his guitar.

Most of this is due to the fine filming of this performance. There are plenty of excellent close up shots of Roy Buchanan's guitar while he is playing.

You will notice that at times Roy Buchanan appears to be crying while he plays. His eyes are watery as he plays his blues notes and adds his signature pinch harmonics and volume control sounds. Perhaps the emotion he puts into his playing.

The filming method or editing of this performance is the highlight of this DVD.

I personally prefer the performance of Live from Austin Texas. But this Roy Buchanan Live at Rockpalast is also a gem in it's own right.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Live-From-Austin-Texas/dp/B0013UL4DS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Live From Austin Texas</a>",1317427200,13,982,5.570469798657718
4460370,4,B004RAW4OE,"At last 23 years after his death,we have a complete,full length concert. Roy is in good humor,and his playing is masterfull. Buchanan is given ample back up by a three man band. Roy tears thru many of his favorites, but really shines on The Messiah,Roys Blues, Blues in D, and the closing Wayfairing Pilgrim,the audio is stero and very good. The video is good ,with a few interference lines thru-out the concert. Buchanan fans should love this show and anybody that digs hot Blues-Rock guitar.

4460371,4,B004RAW4OE,"The only holdback from a 5 star was the repeating of songs. Great writer, great singer,really good band, what a shame he is gone.",1398556800,,129,4.416666666666667
4460372,5,B004RAW4OE,"As collector of guitar music, this is a top ten listing by far. What an unexpected blasting performance.
Guitar-Blues in screaming, smooth, gently, shivering.....(no words for)..
Phuh, have it in my player for the last three weeks, only changed it briefly to hear my other purchases (Janis Joplin and Joe Bonamassa) and changed back again

Always good to have a sublime live performance of a great guitarist!

4460373,5,B004RAW4OE,"To my knowledge, this is the first and only Frankie Miller music DVD released, and it is fantastic.  To have three complete live concerts by arguably the most talented singer/songwriter to ever record is simply blissful.

  There are two discs containing the three concerts.  Disc one has a 1982 show in Loreley, Germany.  It's a daytime, outdoor concert.  There are 15 numbers performed, with Miller standards like `Be Good To Yourself' and `A Fool In Love', but many tunes from the (then) recently released album Standing On The Edge were included.  That album was a harder-edged rock album than most of his previous releases, with several songs having been co-written with former Free bassist Andy Fraser, and this concert smokes. There's a large crowd and the setting is beautiful, although it's not the ideal situation for a live rock show.  Miller even commented on the sun in his eyes.  This particular concert footage has been floating around as bootlegs for a while now, with inferior quality.

 Disc 2 has two earlier shows.  The first is a 1976 concert in Cologne, filmed at WDR Studios.  He performed songs from his second release (High Life), including the superb `Devil Gun'.  Another excellent show, but the crowd was strangely silent, although they applauded sincerely enough between songs. Miller even asked `is anybody even there?', and later, after failing to engage the audience, quipped (with a grin, in a thick Scottish brogue) ""what's this then, Jehovah's Witnesses?""

 The second show was a 1979 gig in Weisbaden.  To me, this is the best of the concerts; a great venue (the Maifestspiele), a packed house screaming for Frankie and the band on fire.  16 songs, ranging from a rare cut from his first album (Once in a Blue Moon) called `Ann Eliza Jane' (amped up from the original) to a medley of his `Ain't Got No Money' with Bob Seger's stolen version `Fire Down Below' to an incredible version of John Lennon's `Cold Turkey'.

Each show has a different band, with ex Spooky Tooth bassist Chrissie Stewart playing in both the 76 and 82 shows, and left-handed ace guitarist Ed Deane in both the 79 and 82 concerts.  The 79 concert has a second guitarist, Steve Simpson, who also plays accordian and a mean fiddle on one tune.

This is the best concert collection captured on film, at least that I've ever seen, and any Frankie Miller fan needs to own this.  I doubt if it will be around all that long, as most Americans are, unfortunately, not familiar with this incredibly talented musician,  Buy now or you will one day regret it.

After watching these shows, I now have to add to my list of disappontments in life not having seen him myself in concert.  But at least I now have this.",1381449600,10,2710,4.749464668094219
4460374,3,B004RAW4OE,"I much prefer earlier Roy on Nancy, his 1953 Telecaster. Still great to have footage of this Master of the Telecaster.",1364256000,,118,4.666666666666667

4460377,5,B004RAW4OE,Great DVD. All guitarists should see Roy perform at least once. Green Onions and Hey Joe are my favorites but all the songs on the DVD are great.,1350950400,,145,4.214285714285714
4460378,5,B004RAW4OE,"just discovered roys work recently, have 2 other live performances by this incredible guitarist, and this did not disappoint!  i have seen all the great players since the 60's incl. jeff beck and eric clapton, but roy surpasses them all, he is by far my favorite guitarist!  his technique and playing is awesome!  wayfaring pilgrim is worth the price of the dvd alone!  how could anyone who is really into guitar work could not be impressed with roy!  his playing here is steller!  roy was by far at his best live! but his studio work is great too!  also great is danny gatton and scotty anderson but roy is the man!  roys music will  live on forever!  from a huge fan...",1335139200,,671,4.471074380165289
4460379,3,B004RAW4OE,"First off..ANY video footage of Roy's unique guitar stylings are worth their weight in gold. It's sad to think that more of it isn't in the vaults somewhere. Growing up in the DC suburbs we got to see Roy live way more than the unfortunates who lived elsewhere. Anyway.....While the production of this show,and Buchanan's playing, are great, it's painfully obvious he's playing with pick-up guys. (Chuck Berry is famous for crappy ones). Most of them were from UK pop band, Martin Stephenson and the DAINTEES ! What do these guys know about the blues? Sure they play OK, but they just don't fit. Save your cash and opt for the short but sweet Austin City Limits set(now with CD too!)It's got waaay more soul,and the REAL band.",1334707200,9,726,4.6796875
4460380,5,B004RAW4OE,"This Rockpalast Concert was recorded at the Markthalle in Humburg Germany on February 24th 1985 - just three years before Roy Buchanan's tragic suicide with John Steele - Guitar keybords & vocals , Anthony Dunn - Bass , Martin Yule - Drums playing and singing on 13 tracks : Thing in G (Short Fuse) , Green Onions , Roy's Blues (Roy's Bluz), Walk Don't Run , Sweet Dreams , Peter Gunn , Blues in D (Blues Shuffle Instrumental) , Hey Joe , Foxy Lady , Messiah (Messiah Will Come Again) , Night Train , Linda Lou and Wayfaring Pilgrim .

Another great live performance by Roy Buchanan & Band and the only thing wrong with this DVD there's venetian blinds in dark blue across the screen for about 10 seconds give o take mostlikely reflections from backstage lightning and as soon as they change camera angles gone , no drama for a Rare live performance and you still get to see the entire live concert on 4:3 full screen not like some with black bars on both sides of the screen with not a bad picture quality & as for the sound only PCM Stereo and Region Free , I have been a fan from the time heard Roy Buchanan on the worlds best guitarists compilation on Vinyl and only two live performances on video that I know about - Live from Austin and Live at Rockpalast so if you're a fan Live at Rockpalast is another rare must have live performance .",1327104000,9,1344,4.312252964426878

The tracks toward the end of the show ""The Messiah"" and ""Wayfaring Pilgrim"" brought me to tears, tears of joy. The man had few equals and this show proves it, a true guitar god.",1440028800,,290,4.388888888888889
8438924,5,B004RAW4OE,"Apart from the well known guitarists of the century, as in Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page etc., to name a few, Roy Buchanan seems to have a reputation of 'the unknown guitarist'. All of the greats know and knew of Roy Buchanan and he was highly regarded in the few documented recordings as one of their hero's and inspirations. Despite never having achieved stardom, he is still considered a highly influential guitar player. I had the pleasure of witnessing one of his shows in Australia not long before he sadly passed away. That show was one of the best of the many live concerts that I have seen. He had an amazing technique which can only be witnessed on this rare amazing DVD. I absolutely recommend this quality Roy Buchanan  DVD , as there isn't a wide field documented on this amazing Guitarist.",1433980800,2,812,4.638888888888889
