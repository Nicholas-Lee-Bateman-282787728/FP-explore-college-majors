149040,4,0792838726,"Aside from the patented soft-focus look and one ""creepy old uncle"" closeup tracking shot of sleeping teenage girls (under the opening credits) this early effort from director Adrian Lyne actually gives us substance over style for a change. With its pop soundtrack and teen angst themes, 1979's ""Foxes"" could have been dismissed at the time as an estrogen-rich flipside of ""Saturday Night Fever"". In hindsight, ""Foxes"" seems ahead of its time, presaging ""Less Than Zero"", ""Kids"" and ""The Virgin Suicides"". Jodie Foster leads a fine cast in this episodic tale of four L.A. girl pals dealing with growing pains at the height of the Sex Drugs & Rock&Roll Era. In this age of ""Sex In The City"" and the ""American Pie"" film franchise, you may find this hard to believe, but as a young male (at the time) I remember being shocked by the frank coversations the girls have about sex and relationships (when the boys have left the room!). Good performances all around, with ""non actor"" Cherie Currie (best known as lead singer of proto-grrrl band The Runaways) actually giving the most believable performance as a troubled druggie. Sally Kellerman (as Foster's mother) has some memorable scenes, and there is a notable cameo from Adam Faith (whom we sadly lost in 2003) as Foster's father. DVD notes: a Cheer to MGM for releasing this sleeper; but a Jeer for the audio transfer-I couldn't catch the dialog at times, and the music soundtrack is undermined by tinny equalization.",1060128000,35,1466,4.915322580645161

149042,5,0792838726,"I know, I know it's the title to Cherie Currie's autobiography; but it fits too good.  For an 80's teenage exploitation flick, this one wins.  Nothing exceeds like excess, particularly in Hollywood.  The location could not be more appropriate, the writing more bodacious or the spandex pants on their teen butts tighter!  'Fast Times...' and Valley Girl may have more notoriety but neither have this slam-bang cast.  Super-Nova actress and director Jodie Foster, Super Self-Destructo former Runaways (other alums: Joan Jett and Lita Ford) Lead Vocalist Cherie Currie and Sally Kellerman as the old hippie chick burnout... mother.  Spark -up another fatty Sally!!!  Boy Howdy!!!  The band 'Angel' performing at the quintesential rock concert and other great awful late 70's pop.  For those of you into this motion picture genre of pop social commentary parody, run don't walk to the check-out lanes.  You will not be disappointed.

149043,1,0792838726,"This was made by director Adrian Lyne before his breakthrough with Flashdance, and features the same dreamy soft-porn lighting he would use in Fatal Attraction, Indecent Proposal and 9 1/2 Weeks. However whilst Lyne's later titles had ideas that captured the public imagination, with themes of crime and punishment circa Cecil B DeMille, this first film suffers from a screenplay that goes nowhere, and interminable pacing. This take on teenagers in LA having a superior moral code to their parents is highlighted by Sally Kellerman describing her daughter Jodie Foster and her friends as ""short 40 year olds, who look like kids but don't act like 'em"". The tale centres on Foster's friendship with 3 other schoolgirls and their efforts to create a ""family"" since their parents are either divorced, abusive or uncast. The group focuses on the drug-taking habits of the most put-upon, whose fate is practically predetermined by the TV movie standards of the narrative. As the natural leader of the group, presumably because she has more acting experience, this is one of Foster's last child roles before she temporarily abandoned Hollywood for Yale and John Hinkley. It's indicative of Lyne's seeming indifference to his performers that he can even make Jodie Foster look bad, though she does yell back well at Kellerman. Kellerman herself is one of the mean adult figures, possibly given even worse material than a thuggish policeman father, and it's a miracle that Lois Smith as another parent manages to invest some character in her brief appearance. The idea of casting Jodie Foster and Sally Kellerman as mother and daughter is probably Lyne's most provocative contribution. Lyne came to work in the USA with a group of British directors who all graduated into film making via advertising, and he does present some early amusing observations of Hollywood oddball streetlife. This is about the only time the screenplay comes up with anything approaching wit - with the girls referring to a woman they see as weird - Mary Weirdo - then sing the Merry Widow waltz; and one line about a pimp ""He could hypnotise you like a cobra and the next thing you're out on the boulevard dressed like the Pointer Sisters"". This film introduced the Janis Ian/Giorgio Moroder classic song ""Fly Too High"" but Lyne barely uses it, which considering the lyrics are apt to the theme, tells you how clueless Lyne is.",990403200,5,2397,4.995

149155,1,0792838726,"The true shortcoming of the film, however, is the lack of depth given Cherie Currie's Annie. Currie, who as a teenager played in the Runaways, had a troubled early life and has been able  from what I have read  to recover. She now works as a counselor, and that is great news. Foxes could have benefited greatly from her experiences and delivered a film that could have accomplished what it apparently aspired to. I imagine that Currie has lived through  and seen things  that Foxes and its makers could not even dream of in their most shameful moments.

Its a great story about wanting to move on and get independent when you a teen.

149178,4,0792838726,"I just saw this for the first time because I read Cherie Curries turbulent autobiography ""Neon Angel"" and having already been a Runaways fan I now consider myself a big Currie fan in particular. I had pretty good expectations for this movie because I knew Jodie Foster was the lead role, and I have an obsession with eras I didn't get to live through the 1970s being one in particular. I've always had a picture in my mind of what I thought the late 70s would look like, and this movie captured that perfectly. It has a certain mood and look to it... I watch this and wish I could walk down Hollywood boulevard in 1979. Also something about this screams afternoon movie to me, especially Saturday afternoon. That's a good time to watch it. Once I got past all the fashion and all the other 70's era stuff I eat up, I really enjoyed the plot. Coming of age stories are really right up my alley. As a teenager my favorite was ""The Virgin Suicides"" and the mood in this film struck me as similar even though I would venture to say its not as dark. I loved Currie in this, really this role was played to a T and that could possibly be because she was living a similar way. I'm just happy she didn't meet the same end her character does. So if you like the late 70's, teen girl coming of age dramas, moody time capsules, or really love ""On The Radio"" by Donna Summer for that matter, I highly recommend this.",1343088000,3,1403,4.2781954887218046

It also introduced me to Donna Summer and her new album at the time, 'On The Radio'. It brought back a lot of feelings from that time, of growing up, the difficulties, the hardships, and the fun! It is a movie I have already watched 4 times in a month. It has its depressing moments, but it has its 'teenage' moments that I could relate to at the time, and it brought back those memories. A great movie overall, and to this day, well Dona summers  'On The Radio' still brings back he feelings of the 80's and being a teenager.

Jodie Foster and Cherie Curry from The Runaways do an excellent job here as does everyone else.  Cherie Curry probably didn't have to stretch much to play her character Annie and Jodie Foster as always does a great job with her character too.
The film isn't polished.  Nor is the acting.  And it shouldn't be.  Some people dismiss the film as inept and low budget.  The film would not work if it were high budget and polished with perfect acting by everyone.  The acting is natural and that is why this film works.

149201,2,0792838726,"Foxes is a coming of age drama about four teenage girls growing up in the San Fernando Valley near Los Angeles. It attempts to be a gritty behind the scenes look at the sex, drugs, and rock and roll of teenagers in the late 70's, but it comes off more akin to another force feeding of aerosol cheese by director Adrian Lyne. Jodie Foster is like the den mother of the Foxes in question, and while she is always interesting in whatever role she is playing, this is a tremendous waste of her talents. She tries to manage the situations and solve all the problems of her three friends, but it is beyond her capability. While she seeks to control the personal lives of her friends, who they date, and so forth, what of her own love life?

The closest she comes to a love interest of her own is Brad, who is almost like a mascot for the Foxes. He is too cute and short to be taken seriously by Annie (Cherie Currie from the all girl rock group The Runaways). He is also too cute to be taken seriously by the audience. The whole time he is onscreen you are thinking, Happy Days, Joanie Loves Chachi, and Charles in Charge. Mostly though you are thinking, what is Chachi doing in this movie that purports to be a gritty behind the scenes look at the secret lives of teenage girls?

Cherie Currie, as the stoner girl that Jeannie (Jodie Foster) is always trying to rescue, either from bad boys who get her drugged up for date rape, or from her psycho cop father, is a disappointment as an actress. You'd think that a rock star from the legendary rock band The Runaways would have some stage presence, but sadly she is totally lacking in charisma. It is so hard to be sympathetic for such a shallow, stupid, and doomed character. They should have picked Joan Jett, if they needed someone from The Runaways so badly. Even Lita Ford, judging by her subsequent musical career, would have been a better choice.

Another bad choice: Angel, the rock band, really added little to the film. Were they supposed to show the total lack of creativity and inspiration the youth of 1980 had to draw on? If so, maybe it was a great choice. I don't remember Angel at all, and judging by what I saw in Foxes, I am grateful for the memory lapse. Speaking of bad musical choices, though, they chose a couple of songs that were totally inappropriate, just really bland pop music that didn't seem to have anything whatsover to do with anything that was even happening in the film. It was as if they owed some songwriter a favor. Was it The Beckmeier Brothers? There were some tunes by Angel that were lame, and lots of stuff by Giorgio Moroder. The only song that worked at all, and then only for a bit of late 70's nostalgia, was ""More Than a Feeling"" by Boston.

Finally, they slap in a totally gratuitous car/skateboard chase, and a totally contrived ending. This was a very ill conceived project. The only reason to watch it is if you are totally obsessed with Jodie Foster, like Hinckley, or if you just want to confirm what a rotten director Adrian Lyne is, has been, and will always be. Foxes is one of his early efforts and also one of his worst. A far better use of your time would be to watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Valley-Girl/dp/B00005JLFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Valley Girl</a>, which doesn't aspire to be any more than a light hearted comedy, but is vastly more entertaining; and has a great soundtrack featuring The Plimsouls (who perform a song live), Josie Cotton, The Psychedelic Furs, Sparks, and Modern English. Plus, you get Nicolas Cage as a Hollywood (the actual city, not as in Tinsel Town) punk rocker.

149202,5,0792838726,"Foxes was a movie that surprised me with how gritty and accurate it was, then and now.  I was 22 when this flick came out in 1980, and it quite realistically sums up the end of the 1970s.  I recall the 70s as being far from the Happy Face, Brady Bunch era they're often remembered as in pop media these days.  My high  school experiences from '72 to '76 were much more like the grubby, druggy, post-Watergate-and-60s-hangover jaded teen pessimism portrayed in this movie.  Jodie Foster is outstanding as the capable, common-sense teen lead, and Cherie Currie does a great job as the train-wreck tight-jeans doomed sexpot chick who's headed for the trailer park, pimp's stable, or morgue slab--take your best guess which.  U-hadda-be-there, I guess.  Great girl-point-of-view coda to the 1970s, and very recognizable to those of us who grew up in that era.  Gritty and real.  Superior movie, redolent of it's time.",1214179200,10,913,4.876623376623376
149203,4,0792838726,"I can't tell you how many times I've seen this movie in the last 25 years or so. Granted, some of the little plot twists are a bit hokey, but as a whole I think the movie stands up well.  I do wish there was something in the way of ""bonus features"" though. It'd be nice to have had audio commentary from Cherie Currie, or Jodie Foster. And it certainly would be nice to have had some more additional concert footage of Angel! I know there is more, as I attended that concert taping at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.",1207785600,2,522,4.1683168316831685
149204,3,0792838726,"This film is something of a cautionary tale about the dangers of drug use, but underneath it, it also presents a very cynical view of humanity in general.  Following the lives of four teenage girls in Los Angeles, circa 1979, it consists of episodes tied together by the thinnest of plot lines.  Everything appears trashy, ugly and venal.  The city is run down and dilapidated.  The teenagers lead barren lives that alternate between mindless drunken brawls and bouts of despair.  The adults are scarcely better, empty, dysfunctional, older but little wiser.  All the characters are intellectually shallow.  Still, there are some powerful moments.  The dream-like soft-focus introduction contrasts the softness of the girl's bodies with the harshness of the environment they live in.  Cherie Currie, herself a rock singer in real life, is completely believable as a drug-addicted delinquent who is sexually attracted to drug-pushing thugs.  The one uplifting element is Jodie Foster's performance as the only person who remains caring and compassionate in a chaotic world.",1207526400,16,1072,5.365269461077844
149215,5,0792838726,Ever wonder what your teens are up to? This movie was like a tatoo on my soul when I first saw it as a pre-teen. And now that I'm older - much older- and have teens of my own I knew they had to see it too.,1203292800,3,205,3.382978723404255
149216,5,0792838726,"If there were ever a band that should have made a campy rock and roll movie, it would have been The Runaways. Five hot teen girls in a Hard Days Night-esque sort of movie, but with way more controversial, under age sexuality. Never happened. A[...]
BUT- Cherie Currie, who was arguably the hottest of the group, did make one movie in 1980, with a cast of girls that weren't quite as hot as the Runaways... (Jodie Foster etc.) called Foxes.
It's your typical late seventies melodrama involoving some scattered home life stuff, and the connection between that and lots of booze bashes during those tender teenage years. Cheri Currie is the bad girl in this one, and we get what we want from her in this flick. ""I'll be damned if I have to sleep with some squares!"" she exclaims, as she's whisked away from her friends by a car full of much older dudes.
Scott Baio plays Jodi Fosters friend, and this was way before he was 46 and ridiculous. He was probably about 18 and lame. But whatever. The movie exudes a rock and roll feel. Even though the only real perfomance in the movie was by the band Angel, who may have been the suckiest, lamest glam band ever. (Punky Meadows...your not a chick!)  But the movie is still enjoyable, in that seventies party animal type way that we all enjoy... a little bit of goofy dialougue thats fun to laugh at.... and Cherie Currie rocks my face around....
Blllrrrrbbblllllrllrlbbbrlrl!!!!... (I'm not gonna tell you what I mean by that, but I can assure you that it's filthy.)

Anyway, I will recommend this one, for your rainy, lets get something different tonight night movie. It'll hold your interest.",1202342400,4,1636,4.618556701030927

149218,3,0792838726,"The movie is alright. But the scene right before the end is powerful and intense!! The last scene is all the more powerful with the addition of a melodic piano verson of Donna Summer's ""On the Radio"" playing. These two scenes alone make the movie worth watching - especially with your kids if you have them, and make you want to hug them and tell them you'll be there for them no matter what!",1158364800,3,392,4.3108108108108105
149219,5,0792838726,"The first time i saw this movie I was 15 yrs old and let me tell you, what I saw in this movie still rang true in my day. A Sobering example of young people not listening and thinking that life is a big game. Overall one of my all time favorites.",1156636800,5,246,3.75
149220,5,0792838726,"Jodie Foster is directed carefully by Adrian Lyne to break out of her typical cerebral mode and thuis give a performnance of real physical depth.  You'll notice in almost every scene she's in, she's always touching, feeling, caressing the bodies of the other performers, the boys and girls alike, she can't take their hands off them, even when she's speaking of something else.  And yet her need to feel flesh doesn't suggest sexual hunger, it seems instead related to a maternal instinct, for she's the one who's always taking acre of everyone else, even her own mother (Sally Kellerman).  The scene where Jodie Foster climbs into bed with sleepy, nerve-wracked Kellerman and reads to her out of Plato--of all philosophers!-- touches something real in all of us who have ever wondered, who is the other half of myself?  Yes, now and then Lyne crosses over the border into a realm of David Bailey bad taste, especially in the opening credit sequence that so lovingly explores the bodies of the four sleeping ""foxes"" who are having a sleepover.  It might almost be an erotic thriller from SHOWTIME.  However, that's what happens when you experiment, you risk bad taste, and I'd rather have a picture that was all bad taste as long as it was doing something unique.  And most of the time the photography serves the characters well, showing the weakness as well as the strength, the maturity as well as the traces of childishness on the faces of all his young stars.

Scott Baio never changes expression in the movie, but we feel we know his thoughts anyhow and can feel what he's thinking in every scene.  Part of this is to the credit of an exceptionally literate screenplay.  People always brag on about, oh, I don't know, Peter Greenaway, but he's done nothing as good as FOXES.  Maybe it's the title, but FOXES doesn't get much credit, does it?  Jodie Foster should have gotten the Oscar for this movie, she does better work here than in either of the films for which she actually won Academy Awards.  And Cherie Currie is fantastic too, she actually manages to seem like she's in some documentary about her own life, fragile, endangered, willful, ultimately inexplicable like all human beings.

And the whole milieu of an as yet ungentrified LA feels lived in, like an Altman landscape.  You really believe these four girls live in this ugly, parched and commercialized space, so that when they visit Randy Quaid's canyon place, it really must feel to them like another world.",1138406400,22,2479,4.786384976525822
149221,2,0792838726,"It's always a shame to see a really talented actor/ actress star in a dud of a movie, but that's exactly what happened to Jodie Foster with 1979's ""Foxes"".  Directed by Adrian Lyne, who would later go on to direct the notorious ""Fatal Attraction"", ""Foxes"" is a cheap, lame-brained attempt at a gritty look into the dark side of teenage life.  The movie suffers from a painful lack of character development and goes in a seemingly incoherent fashion from one scene to another, making it hard to stay focused.  The movie isn't a TOTAL waste--a few dramatic scenes do at least catch your attention; and Jodie Foster, still under 18 when this was filmed, has a real charisma about her despite the fact that she isn't given much to work with.  Plus, that piano melody of Donna Summer's ""On The Radio"" which crops up throughout adds a nice melancholy feel.  Overall though, ""Foxes"" really is pretty lousy and can't be given much of a recommendation.",1129248000,4,943,4.6909090909090905
149222,3,0792838726,"There is a democratic school of film criticism which pretty much holds that a film is ""artisically successful"" if it speaks to its audience.  Judging from the commentary I've seen posted on this film (on Amazon.com and elsewhere), I would have to say that Adrian Lyne's 1980 film FOXES has certainly found its audience.  And judging from the abundance of five star reviews, it's clear that it ""speaks"" to them.

The problem with that ""democratic approach"" for me, however, is that while viewers may connect to a film that addresses issues near and dear to THEM, it is also true that a.) a better film might speak to them even more, and b.) there may have actually been a better version of the film in question, lying on the cutting room floor.  With FOXES, this would seem to very likely be the case.

Those who came of age in the 70s or early 80s (particularly if they were from metropolitan areas) will likely identify with these high school friends who seem jaded beyond their years, simply because they've SEEN it all, even when it's the case that they haven't DONE it all themselves.  (The big complaint of one of the ""foxes"" is that she's still a virgin--at least until about half way through the movie, when she's deflowered by a 20-something Randy Quaid of all people.)  But unlike those of us a decade or so older, they don't get to benefit from a 60's style idealism.  If anything, it's de rigueur for these girls to sneer at hippie-style notions of some of their parents.  It's helpful to keep in mind that this film is from the era when the word ""groovy"" became used only in an ironic sense.

Would that the film actually explored the significance of what it meant to be 17 even as the ""Me Decade"" was drawing to a close.  Unfortunately, the film is just too choppy, and in spots, too contrived, to really pull it off.  In part, that's likely an editing problem (and there really WAS a better film on that proverbial cutting room floor).  But some of its problems are also conceptual.  Unlikely twists--like the chase-sequence-on-a-skateboard featuring Scott Baio outwitting a bunch of thugs--seem gratuitous.

But the more significant problem is simply that of a lack of sufficient character development in a movie that cries out for it.  Odd in a way that a movie in which the characters struggle so hard to be cool should conclude with as hoary a device as a graveside voiceover.  Well, actually, less ""odd"" than downright lazy.

A film like FOXES pushes enough buttons to be almost certain to ""find its audience.""  But that still doesn't mean that that audience doesn't deserve better.",1124928000,9,2601,4.676923076923077
149223,4,0792838726,"One of the few serious movies about growing up in the early 1980s is finally out on DVD. Sadly its bare bones presentation and disappointing digital transfer may discourage all but diehard fans from seeing this touching film.

The ""Foxes"" DVD includes nothing more than a single trailer and standard and widescreen editions. No audio commentary, notes, or anything else. And the film's digitization appears to have dulled the subtle hues and sharp color contrasts that made the original cinematography breathtakingly beautiful.

Despite that, it's worth a look.

Unlike the teen sex comedies that overshadowed it (Porky's, Fast Times at Ridgement High), the movie holds up well against time.

Its theme of teen angst is as relevant today as it was 25 years ago and Jodie Foster and sk8er boi Scott Baio (remember him?) lead a fine young cast.

The film follows four San Fernando Valley girls through a homeless existence filled with sex and drugs. Pills, parties, and boys provide instant gratification and home is where you happen to end up that night.

But rather than condemning them, the film is sympathetic, blaming absent, uncaring adults for forcing these teens to grow up alone. And the charismatic cast is impossible to dislike.

The film's opening - a long and loving pan - sets the tone. As day slowly breaks, the cast awakens amid the objects that define teen girlhood, from Twinkies to a picture of a young John Travola, while Donna Summer's ""On the Radio"" is scored beneath.

From there the pace quickens as we learn about each of character as they head off to school and life. Annie is the wild child who lives for the next party or pill. Deirdre is the boy crazy drama queen. Madge is the shy girl in over her head. And Foster is the one with the plan. It's her job to keep this crew together long enough to finish high school while also keeping her divorced man hunting mother in line.

It's an almost impossible job and one that Foster ultimately fails at.

Despite its age, ""Foxes"" remains a pleasure to watch. Dated hair, clothes, and references to Joni Mitchell haven't hurt the movie.

The cinematography, though dulled by the DVD transfer, presents the L.A. basin in its best possible light, with beautiful filtered shots at dawn, dusk and at night.

Giorgio Moroder adds an excellent 80s soundtrack that ranges from Donna Summer to Janis Ian.

Perhaps the movie's biggest disappointment is that the young stars around Foster never broke out like the casts of ""St. Elmo's Fire"" (1985) or ""Empire Records"" (1995). ""Foxes"" shows why they should have. But maybe like Bowling for Soup's song ""1985,"" they just hit a wall.",1111795200,8,2640,4.827050997782705
149224,5,0792838726,"I loved this movie from the moment I saw it for sale at my video store's discard rack ten years ago. I recently received the DVD as a gift and the sound quality is a big improvement over my old vhs copy.  I recommend it for performances, the story and the photography. Jodie Foster's monologue toward the end of the film is particularly memorable. Each girl's story line is realistic and the film itself does a good job of capturing teen life in the late 70s before yuppie values took hold.  This is NOT a John Hughes film and is a refreshing change for anyone who was subjected that director's teen films in the 80s.",1070755200,12,617,4.356521739130435

Jodie Foster (Jeanie), lives with her mom and is basically a flop house for her friends and especially for her friend Annie ( Cherie Currie), who has an abusive dad. Along with a great soundtrack and the usual reference to pot, drink & ludes this was 79/80. Theres normal teenage angst sans the cellphones and social media of today. It is a poignant, touching story of friendship, it shows the depth of teenage relationships in touching candor. Definitely not the type of teen movies you would expect to see today.
