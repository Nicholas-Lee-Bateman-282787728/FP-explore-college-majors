8700087,1,B00CC44AFS,the seller  knows it is defective. There is a message on the  cd that tells you if you see  double on everything  you can reset your tv to watch it picture on top of picture. I worked for  over an hour trying to figure out how to do that and couldn't. I  buy  every 3  d  movie  I can find . I have great smart tv and invested in the Samsung usb glasses at $50 each and the 3 d  recorder. I have no trouble  seeing all other movies and to be told I have to do something so ridiculous is wrong. I called and was told  you don't take  back open dvd  I explained the problem and was still told I was out the money. It mentions nothing in the add about having to reset  tv  to  unusual  setting  I did  cALL SONY ( TV MANUFACTURER  THEY  NEVER  HEARD OF EVER HAVING TO DO WHAT I READ TO THEM AS THE MESSAGE ON THE CD  IF YOU SEE DOUBLE ON EVERYTHING.I FELT LIKE I GOT TOOK.  I really wanted to see the tour since I can't travel anymore and the trip I took to  the  studios  in California back n the 80s was one of my favorite things I had ever done as far as vacation time and wanted to share with my partner. We are too old and unhealthy to travel there anymore. I also wish you  would make it clearer  when we are buying from a  3rd party It made all this so much  harder and I had to go trough  them and then ask for your assistance which both stated  no way since it was open. I wouldn't have know unless it tole me on the cd it doesn't tell me on the package. They wait until you are all set up and popcorn and glasses ready and ready  for movie night  that is then spent on the phone for over 2 hours.t,1454889600,,1604,3.7951070336391437
