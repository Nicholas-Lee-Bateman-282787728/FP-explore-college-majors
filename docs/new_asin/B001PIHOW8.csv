8333372,3,B001PIHOW8,"Me, Tommy And The Brothers is a very rare thing, an indie drama that works!  Most of the time, indie dramas fall apart from over-acting or a script that's so 'high school' that it's just silly.  Me, Tommy And The Brothers doesn't suffer from any of that, this is a movie that's clearly set in the real world.  This story of friends who have grown up together and are maturing is something that everyone will be able to identfy with.  Giving away the story would absolutely ruin this great movie!

Now, it's not perfect, the video and audio suffer from the technology of the time (1998), it's not digital and there are times when the video is a bit dark, but that's rare and not too distracting once you get into the story...and you WILL be drawn into the story!

It's a great movie and it's well worth your time and money!",1240790400,,822,4.375
