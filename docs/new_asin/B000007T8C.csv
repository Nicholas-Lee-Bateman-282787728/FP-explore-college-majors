1197138,5,B000007T8C,"I'm old enough to remember when this film ""came out! ""  Craig Russell was a wonderully bright entertainer, who had that certain edge.  For historic rites of passage alone, people should buy a copy of this  video.  Long before ""Torch Song"" and/or ""Priscilla,"" we  had Craig and ""Outrageous"" to get us through the drab days of  being gay in this country!
What I want to know is this; Whatever happened  to the sequel, ""Too Outrageous? ""  Why not put both on video and  sell it as a boxed set?  Now, that WOULD be outrageous, wouldn't  it?
Enjoy!",952992000,6,543,4.494845360824742
1197139,5,B000007T8C,"I had a nurse tell me once that the portrayal of the schizophrenic was very accurate. Personally I just couldn't wait to get through her parts to see Craig do his impersonations of Mae West, Carol Channing, Marlene  Dietrich, Judy Garland, Pearl Bailey, Peggy Lee, a WONDERFUL Tallulah  Bankhead, Barbra Streisand...etc. Either through voice and/or drag. All  based on the premise that you should do what you love and are good at, the  rest will follow!  For such a wonderful singer and impersonator to have  died from AIDS is a shame. There were so many more dresses to wear and  girls to imitate!",943920000,3,598,4.747572815533981
1197140,5,B000007T8C,"I loved this movie because it was a realistic, sensitive, sad and funny and heart warming protrayal of one gay man's life.  I took all my friends, gay and straight, to see it because it was such a good film.",929836800,5,207,4.175

1197144,4,B000007T8C,"Not for everybody, but this film explores emotions, friendship, mental disease, and the art of drag in a most raw and interesting format. I saw this film when it first was released back in the seventies. I also knew Craig Russell when he worked his act in Provincetown, MA. A very strange creature who was most talented, but very complex personality that comes out in his performance in this film. Watch it if you are curious enough to see the underbelly of a most unusual female impersonator who was fascinating and quirky. I enjoyed watching it again after many years.",1433289600,3,570,4.71

1197150,5,B000007T8C,"Like others, over the years, I have watched and re-watched this delightful confection of a movie which possesses the rare combination of feeling almost like an indie/documentary/hand-held camera opus while also being very well made. Like art (or good wine) it wears/ages well, presenting a multi-level array of elements including a fun retro look at the gay/bar/fashion/hair scene of the '70's, the ""easy to meet people"", fun-loving, and not-yet-cynical attitude regarding social life and relationships, promiscuity as no big deal, and the message of self-love and self-acceptance over conformity. Craig Russell is perfect as the hairdresser looking for that ""more"" within himself and in life. He and his little coterie of friends create a warm, familiar, and almost cozy sense of affiliation/friendship despite the campy and sometimes abrasive repartee.
This movie has a lot of heart and I ""heartily"" recommend it.",1407715200,3,915,5.49645390070922
1197151,1,B000007T8C,"This is about the worst movie I have ever seen.  There is absolutely no plot.  You don't have a chance at figuring out what these characters are up to.  The camera jumps from scene to scene so fast you have no idea what went on.  The Drag material is old and tired and doesn't translate well in today's world.  Some movies older than this are most enjoyable, even though they are  50, 60, 70 years old.  The acting is very amateurish.  I think this was originally a porn film, and they cut the sex scenes, and this is what was left.  The dvd is clear, and I had no technical issues with it.  It's too bad there is nothing to follow or enjoy in the story.  Craig Russell does about a ten minute routine that is mildly amusing.  Other than that, save your shelf space.
The clue should have been apparent when they charge $22 for a new copy and are willing to buy it back used for $3.42.  I think I will take them up on it.",1401494400,,920,4.101123595505618
1197152,5,B000007T8C,"I watched this for the history initially. It was made on a budget as low as a snakes belly and in places that shows but it is still very clear and watchable. The credits are quite extensive so it wasn't made with a crew of 2 or 3 despite some of the reviews. It was all shot 'in situ' so the flat really is a flat and not a studio. The gay bars really are gay bars of the 70's and not props. The street scenes of New York show how shabby the place was back then. It's practically unrecognisable today. There were no subtitles on my version which would have helped catch the one liners.
I know nothing about female impersonators so I take other reviewers words for the fact that Craig Russell was one of the better performers. He looked uncannily like Barbara Streisand and Mae West though. What stood out for me was his relationship with his schizophrenic friend. She was a first class actress and the scriptwriter must have been very familiar with the thought processes of the mentally ill because they were just so accurate and showed just how real a schizophrenic's internal world is to them and how they project in onto the outside world where they blend in. Being an outsider himself Russell's character is able to sympathise with her and use his own comic creations to help her out. It is done very well.

The supporting actors are just as good as the main cast. I liked the one of the 'Advocate Star' (back page!) who is effectively hustling but tries to convince himself that he is just getting a lend of money to get to the end of the week.

Overall the picture is well worth watching. I have watched a lot of contemporary gay films that couldn't hold a candle to this film despite their slick presentation and high budgets. First rule of movie making - tell a story. And this story is well told despite the limitations of the budget.",1397001600,2,1843,4.4017595307917885
1197153,3,B000007T8C,Craig Russell was a very good impersonator.  Probably the best of his time.  He sang his songs using his own voice.  No stupid lip synching for him.  His was a class act.  Drag performers today who do lip synching obviously have no talent.  Never understood their attraction.,1395446400,3,275,4.74468085106383
1197154,5,B000007T8C,"The performances are quite interesting. It has a fair story line, but the amazing impersonations are what sold it to me. It was such a theatrical film. I think it should be turned into a Broadway show.",1394323200,2,201,4.45945945945946
1197155,5,B000007T8C,Actually this is a very uplifting story. I recommend this to people in all walks of life. Just believe in yourself and don't let anyone make you feel bad about yourself!!,1391644800,2,170,4.516129032258065

1197158,5,B000007T8C,This movie is great. It is a beautiful story about friendship and you get to see the legendary Craig russell at work. I don't want to give to much away because I want you to watch this movie and go on this journey . It is a period movie so it is a window into gay night life on the 1970's so keep that in mind. Please watch this wonderful movie!,1367366400,2,345,3.8732394366197185
1197159,5,B000007T8C,"Craig Russell with always be with us. I loved this movie and the impersonations were spot on. This movie had a certain gritty realness that I love. If you love movies that are a little off the beaten path, snap this one up!",1335571200,,223,4.209302325581396
1197160,4,B000007T8C,"Caught this film the other night on Showtime and was hesitant to watch it at first -- but despite its low budget look it surprises you with it's heart and humor. As I watched, I recalled seeing it in the early 80's with friends. We howled when they showed Craig performing in the NYC club -- not just because he was funny, he was great -- but also because the club crowd was made up of the same extras used in the Toronto gay club scenes! Except their NYC doppelgangers were outfitted with more butch accessories like cigarettes, leather attire and eye patches -- that would fool the audience for sure!! ;-). Later, the Jamaican drag artist that performed to ""Step Out"" in the Toronto gay club, by the end of the film -- seemed to be a fixture in the NYC clubs. Clearly the film production had modest funds, so corners were cut on things like extras and locations, but these just add to the charm of the film. They did shoot some exteriors in NYC -- and it was exciting to see actual NYC streets that showed off a lot of the gay clubs that were around back then.",1295568000,3,1062,4.288557213930348
1197161,5,B000007T8C,"With all the female impersonators come and gone,and I'm talking the CLASSICS: Craig Russell, Charles Pierce, Jimmy James, *still kicking, and young, but his physique is...challenging to pull off his iconic Marilyn that rocketed him to fame, and speaking of the priceless gem Charles Pierce,(who according to Harvey Fierstein from Torch Song Trilogy was ""over 100 years old"" when he guest starred in the movie version, he DID make this comment with love, and respect, as Harvey knew Charles would soon slip from this mortal coil, so wanted to have him immortalized, which has been done with a polished finish, even after all these years.

Oh, but THIS movie!!! Talk about AB FAB!!! My gods, girls, this film must be bought for it's DVD quality, if nothing else, for unlike a poor, tired old VHS tape, at least it will last your liftime.

And the movie itself was just ... I just don't have the words. But his character was just amazing. To be able to pull off a movie, with acting chops to boot? AND 'do his thing'??? The Bette Davis/Joan Crawford ""Baby Jane"" stint was priceless. And those looks that he gives alone are worth watching. The way he just pulls off those looks in his eyes with that mischievious twinkle just keeps you grinning, ready for more throughout the entire film.

And the cab driver who drives him to Toronto!!! Hilarious!!!
When he finds out even the CAB driver is gay, and says, in a pricless moment, ""Isn't anybody straight anymore?"" I laughed till I cried in this movie.

So, to sew this sequined sensation up, SEE the movie. BUY the movie. BECOME the movie...LOL",1295481600,6,1589,4.705035971223022

1197163,5,B000007T8C,"What a throw back to the the good memories of the 70's when I moved to NYC. And a GOOD one! Lot's of us then shared the same hopes and desires ...  we're gonna make it. I have an original VHS copy of this film and cherish it. It's been played over and over and over again. Loaned out. Lost and re-found. Some friends and I Just watched it again. It's still wonderful. Inspiring. Moving. Personal. (No, I never did drag.) After wtching it again, this time I decided to look for the DVD. YES! Found it. I had met Craig Russell several times but I'm sorry to say I never really got to know him. I can say this that in comparison to other female impersonators I have known, he was real, not self centered with a huge ego. He cared for his fans and friends. In reference to others in the business he onces said, ""do you know what STAR spelled backwards is? RATS."" I came across another film he did -- Too Outrageous -- a sequal to Outrageous, made about 5-6 years later. I think all that's available for that one is a poster",1174521600,10,1019,4.1725888324873095
1197164,4,B000007T8C,"It `s not easy to be engaged immediately with this picture, at least I have to recognize it. There are two definite lines that support the script.

The first is dramatic: a schizophrenic girl - Lisa - abandons the Psychiatric Institute in search of more affection and less professional treatment: her mother is a flat mind who can not understand anything about. She will find shelter in her friend: a hairdresser who simultaneously makes appearances in night clubs as travesty, playing fantastic imitations of Judy Garland, Joan Crawford, Jean Harlow and Bette Davis with elegance far from vulgarity and common places.

In this state of things, apparently Lisa seems to be not making the best choice, but the time goes by and finally in a mutual cathartic explosion, she will find affection, understanding and human comfort with her.

The picture was made with a clear resources economy, you can note it through the troubled photography and editions adjustments, but the whole result, being in the appropriate anima, can be rewarding for you.

I guess this film must have been a reference cult movie in many underground midnight circuits in the middle seventies.",1120262400,4,1162,5.036458333333333
1197165,4,B000007T8C,"Though in its time, the mid-seventies, I'm sure that Outrageous did live up to its name.  Robin Turner (Craig Russell) is a wanna-be drag queen who needs schizophrenic Liza Conners's encouragement to take the final leap onto the stage.  This story is less interesting than how well the film captures, in gritty detail, the seventies gay scene.  Mental illness on film rarely works well and while Hollis McLaren does a decent job of acting, these sections feel dated and a little trite.  They also detract from the highlight of Outrageous which is Craig Rusell's glorious drag homages.  Some of the divas he captures spot-on, Carol Channing and Mae West in particular.  Some of the others are fascinating just as performance even if he doesn't really sound or look much like the original star.  I think that dressing up as a woman made Craig Russell feel deliciously naughty which he conveyed to this viewer who couldn't stop smiling as he sashayed through his numbers.",1106611200,3,968,4.901840490797546
1197166,5,B000007T8C,"GAWD I miss the 70's!! Craig is wonderful as the bored hairdresser who decides to spread his wings and imitate the women he adores. The last of a dying breed..the Glamour stars like Mae West, Tallulah Bankhead dawling', Bette Davis, etc..imitators like this are a dying breed unto themselves. {We miss you too Charles Pierce!}

I was once told by a nurse that the schizophrenic characterization is one of the best and most realistic ever captured. ""Crazy"" Liza and Robyn [Craig] are like the 70's ""Will & Grace"" to you younger crowd.

The DVD version seems clearer than my VHS copy and you must realize with these older films that the crispness is NOT going to be there. But this one is good in my opinion. Plus the fact that this is just a gay classic with sad and campy fun moments. What other film will you see a nun on skates, a hunky gay cab driver talking about hitting the baths, NYC gay barfronts of the 70's, and what real gay men of that era actually looked like?",1101686400,20,973,4.430167597765363
1197167,5,B000007T8C,"I've just re-watched this film after 20 years. I was expecting to be only mildly interested since I had seen it so many times in the late 70's and early 80's. I was pleasantly surprised when I got just as caught up as I did in years gone by...This movie is brilliant, touching and a true original. Do yourself a favor and watch it!",1037491200,13,331,4.1875
1197168,4,B000007T8C,"If you have never seen the impersonations of Craig Russel you are in for a treat.
You must see and hear this man of a thousand (women) faces doing his immitations of Streisand,Garland,Mae West and Dietrich. He is simply phenomenal.
The movie is clearly built around his stage performances but still stands on its own.
His friendship with an emotionally unstable girl is very touching and Craig Russell steals the show without killing the movie's rythm.",1016928000,3,452,4.9605263157894735

Seeing it again is a walk down memory lane.  Not a great film, more of a historical document that takes you on a ride of what was the best times of our youth before AIDS.  I wonder how many of those handsome men in the bar have been able to survive into their elder years?  Craig Russell passed in 1990.  For me I'm glad to have had the chance to see Outrageous again, for you its probably more of a study of 70's hair cuts and leather jackets worn without shirts, construction boots and dark back door bars.",1447027200,,658,4.030769230769231

I used to catch Craig Russell's act at the Cabaret in San Francisco in the mid-70s.  He had a huge show, which was comprised of four separate acts: The first act, he appeared as Bette Davis, and then with subtle facial changes and accessories, he did bits from all the brunettes of Hollywood (Joan Crawford, Striesand, etc.). His second act was all Peggy Lee; the third act was all the blondes (Mae West, Carol Channing, etc.) and his final act was always dedicated to Judy Garland.  Craig didn't have a great range in his singing voice, but he captured so many of the nuances and vocal inflections of his 'ladies' that you didn't notice the numerous key changes he used in his illusions.  His humor was always spot on and funny, but never mean; you knew he had a great respect for each one of the women he portrayed.  OUTRAGEOUS is fun, campy and classic for lots of reasons.  It's a great example of indy-type movies from that period, the story is ahead of its time in the troubled personalities it features, and the best part for me: It shows Craig Russell performing some of his best stuff in a way that always brings back wonderful memories of a very special time.",1439856000,4,1339,4.467213114754099
