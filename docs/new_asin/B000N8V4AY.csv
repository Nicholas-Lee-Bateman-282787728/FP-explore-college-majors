8347570,2,B000N8V4AY,"note: this comment is for the version identified as ""1080 High Definition Video"" sold by Green Frog.

Defined as ""High Definition"" but don't be mislead by that description.  As expected from old 16mm video taken in the 1960's or earlier, you can't make a High Def video from such low resolution originals.  When viewing this Blu Ray, I see ""tearing"" and distortion around all areas where there's a transition in color (like between the warbonnet red and anything behind it.
I'm disappointed in this purchase - probably should have purchased the Std Def version (cheaper price) and hope the upconversion my DVD player does would do a better job that what Green Frog did on this......
It is nice to see the old Santa Fe in color however.",1455926400,,735,4.7265625
