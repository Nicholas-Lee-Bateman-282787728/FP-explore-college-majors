After watching it for 30 minutes not only me but my daughter, who is a very a very enthusiastic about dance, we were both bored. This is a big joke and if you plan to spend money, look for something else.",1379635200,,286,3.864406779661017
8355375,5,B000FP2PC6,"When I first played this for my 3 year old she giggled and danced along and she continues to do so. This is her favorite DVD and we play the CD in the car. She is now performing her favorite rhymes all the time. This is clever, fun and unique.",1173312000,,243,3.88
8355376,5,B000FP2PC6,"My niece got this DVD as a present and boy am I glad.  She loves to watch it.  She's 4 and she loves to watch the legs dance and see if she can learn the steps.  She giggles and giggles.  We've gotten to the point where we have to encourage her to watch something else for a change.  You care-givers know what I'm talking about.  So you are aware, you do only see the dancers from the waist down, but that doesn't bother her in the slightest.  I recommend this DVD highly.",1172793600,3,472,4.065217391304348
8355377,5,B000FP2PC6,"My nephews absolutely flipped for this DVD!  They watch it over and over and over -- memorizing the steps.  Finally, I've given a gift that they love!  Thanks!",1168905600,4,159,4.607142857142857
8355378,1,B000FP2PC6,"I guess I should have caught on to the play on words in the title - ""Hip to Toe"".  I am a dance instructor looking for new ideas for my preschool and elementary dancers.  This is NOT what I hoped for by any stretch of the imagination!  The description claims this is an ""Award Winning Rhyming Sensation"" - how misleading!  My children were NOT entranced with this strange combination of headless dancers tapping and twirling to spoken nursery rhymes.  We were all quite turned off by the sheer weirdness of the whole presentation.  YIKES!  I would obviously not recommend this DVD to anyone in the ""real"" world looking for children's entertainment or training materials but it may have some ""artistic"" value for those whose tastes run to the ""artsy"" and unique.",1164585600,5,761,4.763358778625954
