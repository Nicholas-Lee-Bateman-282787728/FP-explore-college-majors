A love story between Doc Brown and a school teacher will make this  picture dull and boring for audiences looking for action, or lots of  special effects. It is still entertaining, however.",950572800,3,419,4.635135135135135
358108,4,630179513X,This video is a great ending to the Back to the Future Series.  When will the Back to the Future Trilogy DVD come out?  I can't wait!,948412800,7,133,3.888888888888889
358109,4,630179513X,"The third installment in the Back to the future-trilogy is a love story and an ending, with boring passages, but still that magical touch of Spielberg/Zemeckis, that makes a movie charming. Fox is back as Marty  (...and Seamus McFly), Lloyd as Doc, ther're a nice duo and they form a  nice movie, for generations to come. But ... why did they changed the  original Jennifer into Elisabeth Shue ?",938131200,2,395,4.695652173913044
358110,2,630179513X,"An improvement on part 2, this second follow-up nevertheless retains some of it's predecessor's weaknesses; most annoyingly, the repetition of scenes from the original. Also, Zemeckis again resorts to a Chuck Jones and Tex  Avery approach (doesn't every ""family"" film-maker these days?).  Thomas F. Wilson's character, particularly, evolved from Biff in part 1, to  Bluto in part 2, and wound up somewhere past Yosemite Sam in part 3. For  all that, at least you can follow the plot and care about the characters,  which is more than you can say for part 2. Best advice, though, is: STICK  TO THE ORIGINAL!",924220800,3,606,4.9504950495049505
358111,3,630179513X,"Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie, and a good conclusion to the series.  But a large part of the movie is Dr. Brown falling in love with this incredibaly boring woman.  Needless to say, this large subplot turns a  fun, exciting comedy, into a long, boring love story. Despite this, it's  still cool to see Hill Valley in it's beginning stages.",921888000,,347,4.4603174603174605

358752,3,630179513X,"Released in 1990, Back to the Future Part III stars Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly, a teen who travels back to 1885 to save his friend, Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Mary Steenburgen plays a woman that catches Docs eye in the Old West while Lea Thompson plays a McFly ancestor. Thomas F. Wilson returns as the villain, both as Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen and Biff, while Elisabeth Shue returns as Martys girlfriend. There are also numerous Western icons featured in peripheral roles.

On paper this shouldve been a great ending to the trilogy and I expected it to be. Unfortunately, the filmmakers didn't take advantage of the great possibilities of Marty & Doc being in the Old West and the movie bogs down in the second act with several dull sequences. So its definitely the least of the trilogy, but theres enough good here to make it worth catching for fans of the franchise. There are several amusing bits and the ending is worth waiting for. NOTE: To appreciate this installment its mandatory to watch the two prior movies first.

The film runs 118 minutes and was shot in Jamestown, Port Hueneme,  Oxnard, South Pasadena, Pasadena, El Monte, Ventura County, Sonora, Universal City and Los Angeles, California. Monument Valley, Arizona & Utah DIRECTOR: Robert Zemeckis. WRITERS: Zemeckis & Bob Gale.

360077,4,630179513X,"An enjoyable conclusion to the series, and in many ways the most superior part of the saga. Marty McFly travels back in time to the old west to rescue his pal Doc Brown, and zany action, adventure, comedy and suspense follow (including romance, as Doc Brown falls for Clara, the new school teacher in town). Of course, like the previous films, don't study it too closely, or consider all of the butterflies being stomped this time around (e.g. at the end of the film, wouldn't the townsfolk, looking for Doc Brown, discover his lab, complete with a model car labeled ""time machine""? Or his ""ice maker""? Or even Doc Brown of the 1950's being repeatedly exposed to future events that transpire, etc.)  Regardless it's a fun story with great special effects and music. A notable detail I always enjoyed about this series was at the beginning of the film during the post-credits sequence, as Marty brings an unconscious Doc back to his house. The music heard is the Clara theme, interestingly enough, but this adds a subdued, almost tragic backdrop to the scene, almost underscoring that Doc, for all of his strange inventions, has ultimately been leading a very lonely existence (to be later resolved in the film.)
Another noteworthy thing about this film is the authentic feel of the old west. Robert Zemekis really did a great job of making what felt like an authentic western environment, and Doc and Marty blend in well into this other world in appearance. There's plenty of dust and dirt and grime, including gritty characters with filthy teeth. Of course it gets a little cheesy towards the end with the train/hoverboard sequence, but it's forgivable.
An entertaining conclusion to the Back to the Future series.",1454371200,,1715,4.873287671232877

362484,5,630179513X,"The ""Back to the Future"" trilogy is the best in innovative movie entertainment. Even 30 years have not diminished the extraordinary storytelling that are these 3 films. The one I like the best is the 3rd version that goes back to the 1880's western frontier. I guess the wide open scenes and the horses, gunplay, and just general mixture of the old and new, give the finale an unforgettable sendoff that is the ultimate climax. Mary Steenburgen is excellent as Clare, Emmett Brown's love interest that alters the shape of his destiny for all time.

I heard such poor reviews that I didn't bother, until this month, October 2015, when the hype over the 2nd installment date was on the news. The second installment was quite boring, but this third installment was wonderful. As much as I'm no fan of any Wild West movies, this particular movie was sweet because it has full and final closure of the adventures of the Doc and his friend Marty McFly. Plus, it is nice to see a happy ending for the poor lonely doc. I enjoyed it as much as the first movie. You don't have to, but it is a good idea to see the second film in order to understand the third movie better and savor the details. If you're a Back to the Future fan, there is no excuse to see all three. Put up with the second movie, but don't miss the 3rd.

But it is SO well written, it is funny, suspenseful, got good twists and its just the right amount of corny. I was not sure whether I would like the third movie, cause generally I'm not a fan at all of anything that plays in Western time. But I can honestly say, I loved it even more than the other two. Seamlessly written to fit right after the second movie, and intriguing and interesting till the very end. Michael J Fox and the dude who plays Doc (sorry, don't know his name) delivered performances that were on point. And that Marty McFly almost learns nothing from these adventures until the very end, yet we are all so intrigued with his character, that is not only good writing but mostly great acting.

how the heck does DOC come in the end with a train time machine??? first off how is that even possible in that time?
then what happened to DOC ""don't mess with history"" meanwhile now he's time traveling with his family anywhere they desire, first he wanted nothing more then to destroy the time machine now he's ok time traveling and won't stay in 1985 with marty...they had to make him a hypocrite like that I hate that but still a good movie",1445990400,,871,4.317073170731708

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!!

1)BTTF2
2)BTTF
3)BTTF3
this film series as a whole has what I call ""megaman"" syndrome. megaman syndrome is when multiple games/films(series/trilogies, whatever) have different titles and themes, but plots, villians and other things are pretty much the same throughout. biff the bully is basically the villan for all 3 films. jokes are reused in different scenerios, but retain the same theme and plot never really changes drastically from film to film. its in this third film you really start to see it. now, I'm not bashing and hating these films for it, I really enjoy them. its just a big thing ive noticed when I got done seeing all three. and that's about my biggest gripe. another minor thing I didn't care for was docs love interest. the love interest in this film was annoying and wasn't needed.

overall, I give this film a 3 stared rating, and the whole trilogy a 4 stared review. really enjoyed these films.",1445385600,,1043,4.60752688172043

366366,5,630179513X,"Since Back to the Future Part II and Back to the Future Part III were filmed back to back, it's not that surprising that part II ends with a cliffhanger.  Part III literally picks up as the second one ends and takes the story in a fun new direction.

At the end of the second movie, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is stranded in 1955.  He enlists the help of the Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) living in 1955 to get the time machine hidden for 70 years back in working order.  But along the way, they discover that the future Doc Brown is shot in the back in 1885.  Marty can't let his friend die, so he heads back to save his friend and bring him back to the present day.

Arriving in the old west, Marty finds Doc living happily as the town blacksmith.  But their plans to return to the present day are hampered when Doc meets Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen), the new school teacher.  It's love at first site for both of them.  Will that alter Doc's plans?  And will he die in a few days or will Marty die in his place?

Despite a bit of a recap of where we left things, many of the plot threads introduced but not resolved in the second movie are finally dealt with here, the biggest being Marty's reaction to being called chicken.  To really get the final scene, you've got to have seen the second.

Those already familiar with the first two will find themselves enjoying this one, too.  While the first two really focused on the McFly family, this one focuses more on Doc, and it's nice to see him in the spotlight for a change.  As always, there's romance, comedy, and worries about time paradoxes.  I've heard some theories about paradoxes from the events in this film, but I don't see them.  In fact, this series continues to be the best use of time travel without paradoxes that I've found.

The old west setting also makes for a nice change of pace.  Don't worry, they still manage to get in a few running gags from the series, however.

The acting has always been great here, and I find nothing to argue about this this installment.  The leads are great, and Mary Steenburgen makes a nice addition to the cast.  As with the second installment, Michael J. Fox plays a McFly relative, and I think he does a better job than he did in the last film.

The movie isn't heavy on special effects, but those that are here work for me outside of few obviously enhanced explosions.

Back to the Future Part III is that rare third movie in a trilogy that holds up to the previous in the series.  These movies are timeless classics that entertain no matter how many times you've seen them.",1431734400,,2585,4.346555323590814

366634,3,630179513X,"Its  okay  but  I  don't  like  it  as  much  as  the  first  2.  After  being  zapped  &  sent  back  in  time  a  mysterious  person  finds  Marty
&  gives  him  a  letter.  Theirs  only  one  man  who  can  help  me  he  said.  Yes  Doc Brown  from  1955  whom  Marty  has  a  tough  time  convincing  his  story,  because  he  didn't  really  believe  him  at  first.  &  he  sends  Marty  back  after  finding  the  time  machine  in  an  old  mine  &  they  fix  it.  They  had  already  located  Doc's  grave  stone,  that  says  he  gets  shot  over  a  matter  of  80.00  by  Bufford  Tannon.
&  their  lady  friend  Clara,  who  was  supposed  to  go  off  into  the  ravine. Marty  accidentally  tore  a  hole  in  the  gas  tank,  &  without  gas  stations  for  about  80  or  90  years  later  they  must  find  a  way  to  get  the  dolloreon  up  to  90  miles  per  hour.
I  didn't  like  the  ending  that  much.  Marty  was  right  he  didn't  belong  there.  &  Doc  needed  to  forget  Clara.  Love  is  okay  but  it  can  also  throw  off  you  guard  &  get  you  into  trouble!
Clara got  upset  after  hearing  the  news,  &  realizing  her  mistake  she  races  to  catch  up  with  Doc  before  its  too  late  &  him  &  Marty  are  back  where  they  belong.  Realizing  Doc  cannot  break  her  heart  he  makes  an  unusual  decision  to  rescue  Clara.  So  the  train  does  not  kill  her.  Instead  of  getting  in  the  car  with  Marty  him  &  Clara  drift  away  from  the  train  &  tracks  on  Marty's  Hover Board  which  he  took  from  a  girl  in  part 2.
Strangest  of  all  I  thought,  Doc  had  been  working  on  a  new  time  Machine  that  looked  like  part  of a  train  &  that  would  run  on  steam.
Which  we  see  at  the  end  of  this  movie,  &  Marty  was  convinced  that  Doc  was  never  coming  back.
&  he  says  well  Doc  its  destroyed  just  like  you  wanted. Doc  had  Talked  about  destroying  it.
&  you  got  to  wonder  whether  or  not  Doc  wasted  his  time,  I  guess  not.  He  just  never  told  Marty he  needed  to  fix  the  maneuvers  &  stuff  &  redesign  a  new  time  machine.  He  kept  a  secret  all  along.  Weird  Huh?  Maybe  he  felt  better  about  surprising  Marty. He  didn't  really  want  to  destroy  it.  Just  Iron  out  kinks  &  do  some  research.  Things  like  that.  I  am  glad  he  didn't  consider  giving  up  time  travel  after  all.  He  moves  pretty  fast  when  it  comes  to  thinking  &  cannot  always  tell  Marty  what  he'd  much  rather  hear.  &  it  must  be  nice  being  able  to  travel  as  far  back  in  the  past  as  you  choose  or  as  far  into  the  future  as  you  want  to  go.
Christopher Lloyd  is  silly  in  all  3  movies!  He  makes  me  laugh! Perfect  at  being  funny.",1423526400,,2827,3.997894736842105

Part 2 did not get very good reviews, and probably is now even less funny, Since it takes place in 2015 and no one new for sure what 2015 would be like. Needless to say, (and we should all be relieved) that  they missed their mark when predicting what society would be like today.
After missing part 2, I totally missed part 3...until now.
Downloaded the trilogy to watch with my kids...they loved it! Being kids, they found a lot of humor in part 2 being so far off base.
But when filming part 3, they once again had the advantage of knowing what the past looked like, so they could better adapt the plot to make things conceivable, and actually were able to finish it off with some positive philosophy.
Another note: all of the comedy manages to stay away from the inappropriate jokes which are so often hidden in today's comedies.",1395273600,,978,4.315217391304348

It's refreshing to watch a movie that can grab your interest from the start and keeps hold till the credits.  I would not consider myself to be a fan of western movies, and I still wouldn't.  Even thought 95% of the film takes place in the Old West, I would still consider it a science fiction film with a western setting.

367393,3,630179513X,"This movie falls in that in between slot, As one reviewer put it. The Clara character is totally useless in this movie, Since Doc is in his 70's to 80's. While Mary Steenburgen is clearly in her early 40's, Marty is reduced to a side kick in this movie. The movie opens where II left off, Marty watching the Delorean disappear in the sky. And having the postal service guy show up in the rain, giving Marty the letter from Doc in the 1800's. So now, with the help of the 1955 Doc, he finds the buried Delorean. Fixes it, and heads back to the west, to save Doc, since he got shot and killed. And the Tannen ancestor makes an appearance here too in Mad Dog Tannen, but what sets this movie apart from the other two, is the pace. And it's slooooooooow, At first. Because the fuel line on the delorean got cut, they now have to figure out a way to get the car up to 88 miles per hour. And the answer comes in the form of a train, which is plausible. And then the movie derails, it gets lost in a romance between Doc, and Clara. And like I said before, there is no chemistry there. It actually feels forced, yes it leads to Christopher Llyod's first ever on screen kiss. but it just doesn't really go anywhere, yes there's the famous Clint eastwood parody done by Marty during his gunfight with Buford. And clara all of a sudden leaves Doc, the reason never really given. But as the train is leaving, she overhears two men talking about Doc's pining over her. And so she decides to head back to town, only Marty and Doc have already left. She catches up to the train that they've hijacked, Marty already being in the car. Lets Doc stay with Clara as the car goes back to 1985, and the train goes over the unfinished bridge. Marty manages to get out of the car, just as an oncoming train runs over the car, totally destroying it. And really to be quite honest, they should have left the movie at that point, Marty picking up Jennifer and going back to the delorean to pick up the pieces. But Doc and Clara show up their kids, in a new and improved Time machine, a train. While it's a good movie, it's not as good as the other two. The jokes aren't as crisp, and the romance is forced. Like I said, not great but not bad.",1374451200,,2215,4.2018779342723

The extras are good, especially the outtakes, which come with commentary so that you can understand why some shots were not used. One of them, where Biff is erased from existence in the 2015 scenes - probably because Lorraine shot him in 1990 - was not used because the audience didn't get it.

367456,5,630179513X,"I am a big fan of the Back to the Future trilogy. I have nothing but a warm spot for the first film, which had the perfect element of science fiction, comedy, and heart. I am also in the minority that enjoyed Part II, and loved it's corner into darker territory. I do agree that a little of the heart of the first film was missing in the second, which was why Back to the Future Part III was a worthy conclusion. I also have a soft spot for this entry since it was made the same year (1990) I was born.

Warning to Viewers: You will have to see at least the last 15 minutes of Part II to understand what happens in Part III. A bolt of lightning (from the same storm that once helped send him back to 1985) this time hits the DeLorean, transporting Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) to Hill Valley in 1885 and stranding Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) in 1955. He has left instructions to Marty of where he has hidden the time machine to be found by him in 1955, how to repair it with help from the 1955 Doc, and use it to drive it back to 1985. He instructs Marty to destroy the time machine when he returns, and to not attempt to get him back. He is happy living as the town blacksmith in a part of time he has always had a fondness for. Marty is prepared to reluctantly respect Doc's wishes until nearby the mine that Doc hid the machine, he finds a gravestone indicating that seven days after writing his letter to Marty, Doc will be shot by Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen (I won't do the formality of telling who whose descendent Mad Dog is) Marty decides to defy Doc's wishes and after he and 1955 Doc repair the machine. Marty travels back to 1885. To cut to the chase, Marty and Doc reunite and after giving Doc the sobering news, they decide to return, but they run into two roadblocks. One is Marty ripping the fuel line when he arrived in 1885 which means they have no gas to get the car up to the 88 MPH necessary to travel back in time.

After a few setbacks. They figure out that instead of trying to run it on its own power (or pull it with a team of horses) They figure out the key is to push it (via a locomotive). But they are also hindered by the second roadblock. Doc falls in love with the new local schoolteacher Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen) after saving her from being driven off a ravine (once again changing history, she was supposed to be killed on that ravine). Doc's feelings for Clara begin to affect his common sense. Adding further complications to the matter is Marty (or Clint Eastwood as he is calling himself in 1885) getting tangled up with Tannen and a series of events leads to Tannen challenging Marty to a duel on the street on Monday (the same day that they are to ""borrow"" the locomotive for their trip back.) As Doc points out it may not be his name that ends up on on that tombstone anymore, but Marty's (Clint) that may.

Some critics complained that once Marty travels back to 1885, it becomes a straight forward Western, with very less time travel than the continuous time travel that took place in Part II. If you recall. In the original, there was not that much time travel, and almost the same amount of time in the film took place in 1950s as this film takes place in the 1880s. Both films also maintain a sense of humor of Marty and Doc (especially Marty) place in a time period different from their own and struggling to fit in. For example, Doc talking to Clara about the thrill of reading 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea as a boy and being inspired to devote his life to science, and Clara laughs revealing that the book had only been written 10 years before. As I said before, this third chapter retains a lot of the heart that marked the first film. For example, perhaps feeling that they have gone as far as they could go with the saga of Marty and the McFly family (Marty's father being murdered, Biff marrying his mother and treating her like a dog.) This film takes a different approach and gives most of the story over to Doc Brown. Lloyd is all up to the challenge, portraying Doc's pain at seeing what he once saw as his greatest creation become his greatest regret. ""I wish I had never invented that infernal time machine"", he says at one point, ""it's caused nothing but disaster"", and of course, his passion at finding love for possibly the first time with Clara (it helps that Steenburgen is just right for the role, just the sweet innocence that you could believe that anybody would have no choice but fall in love with her.)

The film shifting focus to Doc does not take away Marty's importance to the story. A carryover subplot from Part II is Marty's lack of control when someone challenges his manhood and calls him ""chicken"". Doc warns Marty that may lead to an important and dark turning point in his life back in the present day (and based on what we see of future Marty in Part II). Marty's confrontation with Tannen is in a way Marty confronting his greatest fears and this time, it is not so much his future on the line, but how he chooses to live his life and see himself, and that is something no amount of time travel can fix for him.",1361059200,,5101,4.299376299376299
367457,4,630179513X,"So, I watch it 25 or so years later and we see how far cinema has come. All the weirdness of the 80's comes back to haunt you, but its still a great three part series to watch. Ends well too.",1359590400,,191,3.682926829268293
367458,4,630179513X,"Reminiscent in spirit, if not particulars, of the popular Western comedies that Bob Hope was making a generation before this film (to mention only one group from among the numerous predecessors).
Possibly for this reason, I found it to be more enjoyable than the second entry in the series and quite watchable- whether or not you have seen the other two. Another  significant change from the others lies in the opportunity given to Christopher Lloyd to show, for a few minutes, that The Nutty Professor is only one of the many roles which this cultivated actor is capable of playing. For the most part, Michael Fox remains appealing in the lead; however, it seems to me, he is less credible as a high school adolescent than in the previous two pictures in the series (close in time though they were in their production). To the extent this is an accurate perception, it makes little difference in our accepting him as what he is supposed to be. The supporting players ham it up as they are supposed to do, with the exception of the attractive Mary Steenburgen, who gives the School Marm a suitably luscious presence, if not quite the flavor of Mae West in either of her Western outings.
All-in-all, this is an enjoyable Western comedy, and, certainly a family movie (if such still exist).",1359244800,,1288,4.724444444444444

367460,4,630179513X,"This movie is basically about what happened to Emmet Brown ""Doc"" after the DeLorean got struck by lightning in 1955. Marty is stuck then he receives a letter a few minutes later. Marty reads the letter and figures out that Doc sented him that letter from seventy years ago. The letter says that Doc is out in the wild west in 1885. Doc states that he should go receive help from the other Doc from 1955. The letter also states that Marty should never return for him and go straight to 1985 but Marty soon discovers that Doc got shot a week after he wrote the letter. Marty soon realizes what he has to do.

  I like the flow and the realistic feeling about this movie. I personally think this movie is very fun and entertaining but unlike movie one and two, there isn't really a point to this movie. I figured the point the creators of the movie were trying to make was that they had to save Doc before he got murdered but since there was the original Doc living in 1955, why did he have to go save the other Doc? Another thing I didn't really get was that from the very start of movie two, Doc said that they would need to destroy the time machine but at the end of movie three, Doc builds another one. I also thought this movie was about saving Doc but later in the movie you realize that this movie is all about Doc's Love life. I enjoyed renting this movie on demand. I watched it several times before the due date expired. I would say this movie was well worth the money and I would recommend it to almost anyone above ten years old. :-)",1356998400,,1542,4.202702702702703

367491,3,630179513X,"As a whole, the Back to the Future movies are just awesome. The first Back to the Future is probably one of the best movies ever created. I have a hard time imagining that anyone would dislike the plot. The second of the movie is better. It goes to the future and even gives a nice spin on the original movie.

The third one I think is a bit off. I like the idea of the wild west. I believe in several parts of the original, Doc mentioned that his favorite era in time is the wild west. By the end of Back to the Future part 2, Doc went back to his favorite era by a freak lightning accident. Doc wrote Marty a letter that explains the issue and that he stored the car in an abandoned mine with instructions on how to rebuild a missing part of the time machine so he can get back to the year 1985. Marty then finds out that Doc actually dies and Marty decides to travel back to save Doc from being murdered. Marty travels back and the fuel tanks gets a hole which causes the vehicle to be disabled.

So with that in mind, this is where the movie begins to fail. While Marty and Doc were discussing ideas, I was actually pounding my head on the table saying, ""If all they need is gas, then couldn't they simply use the gas from the time machine that Doc stored in the mine?"" If Doc stored the time machine, and Marty came back with it, then the time machine that Doc stored would still be in the mine. And he could have easily re-written the letter to include instructions to put in gas. Plus in Back to the Future 2, it is suggested that Doc made some upgrades to the car to include alternative fuel. Some odd reason Doc it also runs on gas. So I'm a bit confused there as well.

So this baffled me and instead the entire movie made into a bizarre attempt to get the car up to 88 miles per hour and then a love story. For this, I felt the movie was the weakest and most certainly a bad ending to an otherwise good series.",1330300800,,1921,4.063324538258575
367520,2,630179513X,"While Back to the Future 1 & 2 & the followup interactive movie (game) by Telltale were all wonderful, Back to the Future III falls short. Even though the trilogy is really just one long movie broken into 3 parts, III takes itself far less seriously than the first two parts & has more suspension of disbelief problems, the worst of them being the unbelievably contrived Disney romance between Emmett Brown (whom is 70 or 80 years old) & the utterly useless token love interest Clara Brown (30 or 40 years old).

Seriously, unless you're a big fan of Back to the Future: The Animated Series, Clara is a completely useless piece of filler. No wonder Clara was reduced to a mentionable in the Telltale game; Brown's alternate timeline love interest Edna Strictland at least had a personality, background story, & served an actual purpose. Realistically, when two best friends both get married, they dedicate themselves to their families & drift apart, so I couldn't really take it as a happy ending either.",1328054400,,1004,4.803468208092486
367521,3,630179513X,"As a diehard fan of the original BTTF, I was totally disappointed when I saw its two sequels in theaters back in the day.  I thought both were nonsensical (as if a movie about time travel is practical) while superficially trite, but through the years I've mellowed a tad.  After repeated viewings of this third and final installment, while I still find it embarrassingly silly with its relentless shark jumping, I still have fun watching it.

The primary focus of my enjoyment is the comedic mayhem of Christopher Lloyd as Dr. Emmett Brown, and Thomas F. Wilson as Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen.  As the third installment finds the characters in 1885, Lloyd and Wilson have the lion's share of funny scenes, as Doc Brown adapts to his techno-depraved environment, while 'Mad Dog' aptly demonstrates why he is the originator of the Tannen line of bullies.  Both actors are genuinely funny, and make the most of what they have to work with, which periodically is hemmed in by contrivance and plain silliness.

Michael J. Fox is fine reprising his role as the determined Marty McFly, yet I was rolling my eyes as he doubled as McFly's great-great-grandfather Seamus McFly, with Lea Thompson playing Seamus's wife (obviously, the filmmakers needed something for Thompson to do).  This thin ploy never really worked.  And Doc Brown's love story with school marm Clara (Mary Steenburgen) is never fully vetted or developed.  The Jules Vernesque ending is another layer over the top, yet despite all these misgivings BACK TO THE FUTURE PART III is a fun way to say goodbye to an entertaining franchise.

367522,5,630179513X,"Back to the Future Part III(1990) picks up where the second film left off and completes the story arc. Marty McFly is stuck in 1955 after the DeLorean is struck by lightning. Marty and a younger version of Doc Brown restore the DeLorean after they find it in a cave. When Marty finds out that Doc Brown was killed in 1885, Marty travels to that time period to take Doc home. In 1885, Doc Brown falls in love with a lovely, educated schoolteacher, Clara Clayton(Mary Steenburgen). Marty, Doc Brown, and Clara are bullied by Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen(Thomas F. Wilson). Marty has to stop Buford Tannen from killing Doc and they have to return to 1985. Back to the Future Part III cuts back on technology and puts more of its focus on plot and character. There's an homage to Once Upon a Time in the West(1968) as the camera films Hill Valley, California in the year 1885. Back to the Future Part III was filmed in Jamestown, CA and I saw it on a field trip in grade school. The town was destroyed by fire. Alan Silvestri is back and he adds a ""Western"" flavor to the music score. A scene where Buford Tannen kills Marshall Strickland(James Tolkan) in cold blood was deleted from the film. ZZ Top makes a cameo in the film and they perform the theme song. Sexy Mary Steenburgen is quite good as Clara. She also played Clara Clayton on the Back to the Future animated series. Back to the Future Parts II and III were filmed back to back in 1989. Movies such as Missing in Action I and II and The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions used the same gimmick. Back to the Future Part III was a solid, final film in a fun movie franchise.",1320537600,2,1633,4.375
367523,4,630179513X,"Well, here we come to the 3rd and (sniff) final chapter. I bought the trilogy for my mother, and while she did enjoy parts 1 and 2, she felt this 3rd one was the best. And we could easily argue that the 3rd is the best. Going through my mother's TAXI DVDs, it seems that Christopher Lloyd brings the most qualities of his famous character Jim Ignatowski into play here. (Example: reading a letter he wrote and crying: 'I never knew I could write anything so touching.')

Marty finds that Doc Brown will be murdered back in 1885 (where he ended up at the end of Part 2 when the lightning struck the time machine). So the 1955 Doc Brown helps Marty get the time machine working again.

There is somewhat of a sad winding down as we see that when we first saw the time machine in Part 1, it could only be driven. Then by the end of part 1 the time machine could fly; now in Part 3, it can no longer fly and can only be driven; and soon after Marty arrives in 1885, he has an accident, and it can no longer move and must be pushed or pulled somehow. (SIGH) With some sad symbolism, we know that this is going to be the last chapter.

Moving on, Marty runs across his great great grandfather (played also by Michael J. Fox). This is interesting in that he finally has a blood relative 'father figure' on his adventures. And he spends a fair amount of time explaining to Marty that if he keeps jumping everytime someone calls him 'chicken' he's going to eventually plague himself with disastrous and possibly irreversible consequences. (We already heard his parents speak about this in Part 2. So we know something is going to possibly happen because of this.)

Without going on too long, Doc Brown realizes that he has fallen in love with a school teacher named Clara. So, this of course complicates things. Escaping into the future could mean breaking his own heart as well as hers.

In all honesty, this 3rd chapter has the most suspense as well as the most value in the ways of characters growing. Marty (with the help of his great great grandfather and Doc Brown too) realizes that it's stupid to jump everytime someone calls you a name. And after all the time he thought about the future, Doc finds that he is most happy in the past.

Lloyd brought REAL comedy to the role when he portrays himself as a depressed drinker talking about the future in the old west. (Another Jim Ignatowski moment.)

It's probably also right to take amoment to talk about the antagonist Thomas Wilson. He could be a convincing bully, a tough mafia type, an evil cowboy, and even a nice redeemable guy as we have seen in the end of Part 1, and again in Part 3.

Robert Englund was not so likable as the principal in Parts 1 and 2. BUT, he is really likable and admirable as the ancestor of his Prinicpal Strickland  character Marshal Strickland. This is Englund's best moment in the trilogy. He knows he can't just kill Maddog Tannenn, but he isn't blinded by the 'law abiding citizen act' either. ""Maddog, the only party I'll be celebrating is the one that ends with you hanging at the end of a rope.""

Overall, it's a great trilogy. And we could easily argue that Part 3 is the best.",1318464000,2,3164,4.3931623931623935

Without the innocent, loose grasp of reality present in the first film, nor the amusing, campy glimpses of the future seen in the second, there's really not all that much to look forward to as this bad western lolls its way toward the finish line. Marty McFly and Doc Brown still make for strong core characters, ones we desperately want to see come out ahead, but they've got their arms full here with a stale set of recurring gags, a base premise that's thin at best and a hammy love story that doesn't really bring anything meaningful to the table.

But what I have to say is... this movie is definately my least favorite of the trilogy and you know, don't get me wrong it's a good movie but some of it's lacking. The plot involves Marty stuck in 1955 right after the Delorian was struck by lighting with Doc inside, sending him to 1885. So Marty gets the 1955 Doc to find another Delorian that 1885 Doc put in a mining cave in the outskirts of Hill Valley.

When Marty travels to the old west, the Delorian's fuel tank gets damaged so it can't get up to 88 miles by itself, so now he's stuck in 1885 with Doc, who finds true love with a person named Clara. That's one thing I never liked about this movie, its nice he found somebody but it does that thing that I hate, it happens in every romance movie: boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy is depressed, boy gets girl in end. It kind of slows the movie down. And there isn't as much time travel or paradox in this movie which is what made the other two movies so great. But there are some funny moments and the interaction scenes with Doc and Marty are nice. And the train scene and the showdown scene are both great, giving nice little tributes to Clint Eastwood, and the music score is still awesome.

The letter says that he hid the Delorean in a cave, and to use it to get back to 1985 and to not come to 1885 to rescue him. But when Marty finds out that Doc dies from a gunshot to the back, he decides to not listen to Doc and head back to 1885 to save Doc from dying. But when he arrives in 1885, he busts his fuel line, leaking out all the fuel. And in 1885, there is no gasoline. So while Doc and Marty try to figure out how to get back to 1985, they must also try and not die by the gun of Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen, the relative of Biff.

While part 3 feels like part 1 and 2, it almost feels totally different. It being more of a western has a big hand in that also. And I love westerns, so I love part 3. Honestly in my review of part 2, I said part 1 is probably my favorite, but I really don't know. I love all 3 parts equally because even though they all have the same premise, they are all so different at the same time. In part 3, I absolutely loved the character of Buford Tannen. He was absolutely hilarious. And he really felt like he was a bad guy from back in the west. The way he talked and the way he looked. I also liked how a lot of part 2 hinted at parts of part 3 (since they were both made back to back). For instance, Marty sees a picture of his great grandfather in part 2 and he says something like ""Good looking guy"", but in part 3 we find out it was really Marty himself. And definitely one of my favorite parts of all 3 movies is here in this movie. The final scene with the train trying to get the Delorean to the future was done really well.

For the final part of the trilogy, I really couldn't have asked for more. Definitely a great ending to a great trilogy that will be loved for a long time by children and adults. OWN THIS!

367573,3,630179513X,"***  stars for ""Back To The Future, Part III"". Well, this movie isn't exactly a western, but it's a nice twist in the direction of the series, and a good conclusion to this excellent saga. This time, Marty (Michael J. Fox) and our favorite mad scientist Doc Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) are stuck in the Old West, and that premise gives a lot of opportunities to play with opposite genres, Western and Sci-Fi.

 ""Back To The Future, Part III"" also presents references to classic westerns, specially John Huston's famous camera angles that show desert landscapes, and spaghetti westerns, like Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon A Time In The West"" and ""The Man With No Name"" trilogy (or ""Dollars"" trilogy, if you prefer). One funny example of a reference to classic westerns happens when someone asks Marty his name, and he always answers ""Clint Eastwood"".

 I can't imagine a different cast in these movies: Michael J. Fox superbly plays the hero of the trilogy, Christopher Lloyd does what he does better: he plays a lunatic, Thomas F. Wilson mastered the role of Tannen (Biff, Griff and Mad Dog Tannen). In few words, every actor seems perfect for every role.

 ""Back To The Future, Part III"" is a very amusing movie, it has comedy, action and romance, and the movie closes one of the most entertaining trilogies ever made.",1091750400,,1320,4.814159292035399

""Back to the Future Part III"" is the third and concluding chapter to the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy.  For many years this was my least favorite film in the trilogy, but watching it again for the first time in years I have new appreciation for it.  ""Back to the Future Part III"" is a satisfying and worthy end to this trilogy.
At the end of the second movie the DeLorean is struck by lightening (which we already know provides the necessary 1.21 gigawatts of energy required for time travel) and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) is sent somewhen in time.  Marty (Michael J Fox) is stuck in 1955 Hill Valley, but just after Doc and the DeLorean disappears a letter arrives for Marty.  The letter is from Doc and was written in 1885.  It was left as the post office with the instructions to be delivered on that particular date at that particular time.  The letter says that Doc is alive and well in 1885 and under no circumstances is Marty to try to go back and rescue him.
Marty returns to the 1955 Doc Brown and enlists his help to recover the DeLorean which was left in a cave for 70 years.  While recovering the DeLorean Marty discovers a tombstone with Doc's name on it...and the date that Doc died was only a week after he wrote the letter!  The tombstone reads ""shot in the back by Buford Tannen (Thomas F Wilson) over a matter of $80"".  There is no way Marty is going to let this happen, so he puts gas in the DeLorean and travels back in time to 1885 to help Doc.  Of course, if it was that simple, we wouldn't have much of a movie, so complications evolve.  The DeLorean ruptures its gas line, so that it leaks gas and can no longer be driven under its own power.  Part of the movie is Doc and Marty trying to get the DeLorean back up to 88 miles per hour, but there is also the matter of Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen who still intends to shoot Doc over that matter of eighty dollars...or will history change and will Marty's name on that tombstone?  This final installment also introduces a love interest for Doc Brown in the person of Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen), the new school teacher with an interest in science.
This movie is much more of a straight forward action/adventure/comedy (whatever) movie.  The time travel serves to get Marty in the past and back to the present, but there isn't as much playing around with time travel as there is in the second movie.  I still think this might be the weakest of the movies, but it is a very fun ride.  While this movie will never reach the ""classic"" status that I feel the first one will, this is a very enjoyable movie and is a fitting end to the trilogy.  Good stuff.",1077753600,3,2653,4.338056680161944
367575,5,630179513X,"This is the best of three in the Back to the Future trilogy.  It was set in the past and in the west during the times of cowboys, indians and especially gun sliggers.  I loved all of the reference to past events, and the humor it brought to the film.  This is a film I can watch over and over again, unlike the first in the trilogy.  Unlike the second film in the trilogy this film kept my attention, and wasn't so off-the-wall that it was unbelievable.

367577,2,630179513X,"Picking up right where the second movie leaves us Marty McFly learns that Doc has ended up in the old west of Hill Valley and now its up to Marty to get back to him to save his life. With the help of the Doc of 1955 Marty is able to get to the past and take on an old west thug nammed  ""Mad Dog"" Tannen. Besides taking on that gun slinging criminal , Doc has fallen in love with a school teacher named Clara who he has to tell the truth to about where he is from. If things weren't bad enough, the DeLorean has no gas and now they have to figure out a way to get back to the future again by getting the time machine to 88mph. Its a true wild west romp and it ends the trillogy in a decent mannor.
This movie sorta slows down the pace a bit , and unfortunatly I think a bit to much, when you look back at the two previous to this installment. It lacks the fun and newness of the first and the action and story of the second and pretty much turns into a second rate western with Back to the Future characters in the roles, with them trying to relive the idea of a kid from the 80s trapped in another time period like in the first film, but it just doesn't work for a 1880's setting. Bottom line, while it is a good movie at points, the fun just isn't here as it wants to be.
While not as good as the other two it does have its moments. The fun of seeing Doc's lab at the begining in 1955 which has a lot of the hidden jokes from the first within. Some good western jokes like him taking the name ""Clint Eastwood"" and a very exciting climax with a huge locomotive pushing the DeLorean on traintracks, all make this movie still worth it and a good one to watch.  Just don't expect the fun time traveling and characters that were in the other two. They stay trapped in the west for most of the movie and the amount of things that just seem to not make sense are very high in this movie. A lot of contradictions show up at various points to things that were well established in other movies (IE Not remembering who put Marty in the tacky clothing he winds up wearing). It is still a must have for anyone that is a fan of the Back to the Future series especialy as it just isn't complete without knowing how it ends or even a fan of a good movie to pass the time. Just don't expect to much as it doesn't deliever like the other two did with flying colors. It does end the trillogy on an up note and something that will make you smile and still want more. It will also make you wish they had more going on in 1985 at the end then the quick rushed ending they seem to come up with.  A fitting end none the less, just could have done much more then they wind up doing and at times it may even leave you unfullfilled.",1045267200,7,2706,3.9705882352941178

This time, Marty does battle with Biff Tannen's descendent, Mad Dog Tannen in a final confrontation that's too good to miss!

This movie has everything, friendship, romance, homour, action and wonderful Western scences. The Western scences make this movie look epic, the friendship between Marty and Doc is keep growing and the bond between them is so strong. The action is the best of the trilogy, just look at the duel of Marty and his nemesis and the train part. The romance for Doc and a school teacher is charm of this movie. Finally a perfect ending for this classic trilogy. The main character, Marty, also 'grown up' from last two movie, I say grown up that is because he can control his attitude when somebody called him chicken or coward even he knows he doesn't have to fight to. Hence he changes his future from nearly a car accident from Part II. Although this movie is less homour than last two, but it should be the way it is.

367583,5,630179513X,"""Back to the Future Part III"" is, in my opinion, the best of the entire trilogy. Of course, that's just my opinion, but I can't be wrong because it's a point of view, right? That out of the way, let's get to some heavy duty praising for one of our best directors, Robert Zemeckis. There are very few directors who have such a love for the craft of filmmaking that, when you see their work on the screen, you know they were going totally buckwild, just having the time of their lives with all the gadgets at their disposal. Sam Raimi is one, Spielberg, Shyamalan, and Lucas are three more, and definitely our dear Bob Zemeckis. All you have to do is look at his menagerie of films: ""Back to the Future"", ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"", ""Forrest Gump"", and ""What Lies Beneath"". Even though I didn't like ""What Lies Beneath"", it still had some of the coolest camera moves I've seen in recent years. But come on, ""Roger Rabbit"" and ""Forrest Gump"", not to mention said trilogy are classics, filled with remarkable visuals and a wonderful sense of humanity. ""Back to the Future Part III"" is no exception to that rule.
This isn't usually revered as the best of the films. In fact, other than a few friends of mine, the only critic I know of to agree is Leonard Maltin. But I believe it to be for a few reasons. First, this is by far the most fast-paced entry in the trilogy. It moves from scene to scene at 88 mph and never stops until the end. Secondly, despite this enormously fast pace, it never ceases to have a beating heart at its center. The love story in the film, which finally revolves around Doc, is very sweet, and the friendship between Doc and Marty continues to grow. Third, the dialogue in this film seems like it went into hyperkinetic overdrive. It zips! That's why, even in a film of mostly character driven scenes, it never loses pace. There's also a very clever reversal of character stereotyping between Doc and Marty that I'm glad they saved for this film. If it had been in the second or even the first one, it wouldn't have come off as well.
But anyway, as is the usual with the plot of these films, look at the title. We are in the year 1885, and Marty has torn the fuel line on the DeLorean, which looks really hilarious with white-wall tires from 1955. So, in order to get the time machine up to 88 mph, Doc devises a plan to hijack... oh, sorry... borrow a locomotive, and using some very specially made crystal logs, getting the boiler hot enough to push the time machine back to the future. Meanwhile, we've got the threat of a duel with good old Biff's grandfather, Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen, and the aforementioned love story between Doc and a teacher named Clara who he managed to save before a grisly fall to her death. All very simple, all very smartly done, using all the cliches from spaghetti westerns to its advantage, and with incredible visual effects for its action-packed, explosive finale.
It's really hard not to like this series of films. I don't know anyone who doesn't like them. And I think most of that has to do with the fact that, even with all the wackiness and special effects and one-liners and comedy, what really draws people to these films is that the characters are us: They don't react all that differently from how we would. And we all wonder from time to time what would happen if we could go back and change our past, or if one little different thing happened, how would we turn out? The ""Back to the Future"" films address all of these things with a whole lot of brains, heart, and laughter.",1018396800,18,3542,4.442396313364055

One of the real and unexpected treats of Back to the Future III is Thomas Wilson -- who played Biff in the first two movies -- as ""Mad Dog"" Tannen.

367586,5,630179513X,"The three films have to be watched one after the other. They are a whole. They are first of all and above all a marvellous piece of entertainment with two elements that come back as salient characteristics. First Biff and his transformation in time according to various accidents in the time line. A bully remains a bully even when circumstances tame him slightly. The second is a reference to Clint Eastwood in the funniest possible way. It is crucial in the end, but you have to discover the twist. The first film's trip to the past is kind of pulpy because it is an intervention in the parents life, when they are teenagers and the question is how can the son help the parents get together and become the progenitors the son needs to exist. A trip into the past that changes slightly the present, but with no serious consequences. The second film is heftier in that sense that a trip to the future causes a twist in the time line that requires a new trip to the past to correct the twist. Funny because the three time periods are mixing in the most hilarious way. The third film is for pleasure. It is about the retrieving party that is supposed to bring Doc back to the present from his very distant nineteenth century past. He will not come back, except for a visit later on. The time machine will also be destroyed and things will come back to normal, except maybe for Doc Emmet Brown, but he likes the change.
This film deals with time, the present, the past and the future and beyond the entertaining aspect it is deeply reflexive. First, time must not be changed in anyway without tremendous consequences. We must not play with time. Second, the travels in the past show how things have changed from one period to the next, from the past, no matter which, to the present. Some of the questions are serious, like the future of black people in 1955. The answer is in 1985. Just as serious is the fate or future of bullies if by any chance they get power, that is to say money. We must stand our ground in front of them to keep them in their place, the margins of society, a tolerated existence and not a dominant position. Just as serious is also the question about heredity : one generation always reproduces what the previous generation has done. A bully has to be born from a family of bullies even if circumstances can guide the realisation of this bully-ness. Then the position of science in our society is extremely fragile because it may disturb the flux of history with some unforeseen and unforeseeable invention that is the result of some crazy imagination in some mad scientist. We must both trust and question science in our society. The films are optimistic provided science is kept in its place, that is to say the margin of history, otherwise catastrophes can occur. Finally, travelling in time is funny and the stories of such travels have to be hilarious and the films are superb.

Thats all in the fun, and we never get tired of it. In fact, after the Star Wars and Indiana Jones series this probably falls under the most loved series ever produced.

There, he tries to save Doc Brown(Lloyd)who is to be shot and killed by a mad gunmen. Is it any surprise that the guy who is supposed to kill Doc Brown is a relation to Biff?. No, it isn't.

367594,3,630179513X,"After an exhausting second installment in the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy, ""Part III"" quickly changes pace and reveals itself to be a charming and exciting end to the time travel series.  The film begins right after the events in the second film which found Marty and Doc Brown travelling from the future, to a sinister 1985, to the wholesome 1955 to save the space time continuum.  Even with this fun and fast paced adventure, ""Part II"" was essentially a downer.  ""Part III"" lightens things up considerably.
Marty is now stranded (again!) in 1955, and his friend Doc Brown has been stranded in 1885.  Disregarding Doc's warning about any more tampering with the space time continuum, Marty risks yet another time travel trip only this time to 1885 to rescue his friend Doc Brown.
The story arc here is almost identical to the first film in that Marty is stranded again, is trying to get home and devises a thrillingly complicated action sequence to get back to 1985.  As the story centers on only one era; the old west, the film has a great deal of fun focusing on eccentric cowboys, gunfights and train wrecks.
Also in the spirit of the first film, there is a sweet romance only this time it's with the most unlikely ""BTTF"" character, Doc Brown himself.  Doc falls in love with a charming school teacher and is torn as he ponders whether he should stay in the old west with is true love or go back to the future.  In the first and even second film, Doc spent a great deal of time telling Marty he shouldn't take chances.  This time it's Marty telling Doc to grow up and make smart decisions but Doc can't help himself because he's in love.  It's a charming development.  ""Part III"" is funny, sweet and has none of the negative traits of the disappointing ""Part II"".  While not as great as the first classic film, ""Part III"" delivers a grand entertainment full of good cheer and warmth.

Of course, it has a lot of things incorporated from the other two, but it has some new things, too. Part 3  is, basically, a western because 80% of it is set in Hill Valley 1885.  Originally, Marty was just going to go home in the DeLorean (which is in a  hole underground and has been for 70 years,) but now he must save the Doc  of 1885, because he will die in 7 days. When he goes back there, he finds  out that Doc Brown has a GIRLFRIEND! But he also has crashed the DeLorean  and the fuel leaked so now he can't go back.

By the way, Marty calls  himself Clint Eastwod, and eventually they name the ravine after him. Will  Marty save himself and the Doc one more time? Will they get back to 1985?  How about Clara, Doc's Girlfriend? Find out in the conclusion of this great  series.",964656000,,1122,4.11520737327189
367596,4,630179513X,"This is another really great sequel to Back To The Future. This time we pick up right after the end of Part 2 in 1955. After the Doc was accidentaly sent back to 1885 Marty must get the 1955 Doc to help him get  back to the future, 1985. Doc has burried the Delorean in an abandon cave  from 1885. But Marty finds out that Mad Dog Tannen, the Biff of the old  west murders the Doc. Marty now has to go back to 1885 with the help of  1955 Doc to save the Doc from death. Equal to Part 2, but again its missing  that comedic charm we saw in Part 1. It also has some chessy jokes. But its  still another very exciting adventure in time. I suggest you see Pats 1 and  2 first! Rated PG for language and some violence",961286400,,712,3.9027777777777777
367597,3,630179513X,"No, it isn't the best - the love interest with Mary Steenberger had a wrinkle in time that made little sense, but not enough to worry about.
The Old West scenes were fun to watch, though, and if you have a  kid who likes trains, this may be their favorite movie in the trilogy. In  this version, Doc's gotten stuck in the past and tells Marty to leave him  alone - he's content to be inventing things back in the past, though he  must find it frustrating to invent things he can't show anyone - his rule  has always been that when you time-travel, you mustn't do anything to  change the future.
Marty ends up back in the wild west in the Delorean,  the very time-machine that needs plutonium to get it moving fast enough to  warp into another time. When he lands, he manages to gouge a hole in the  fuel tank, and eventually he realizes he's not going to find much plutonium  in the Old West.
Oh, no!  Are they stuck in the past forever? Not very  likely, as Doc figures out how he can get them back to the future.
It is  also frustrating for those of us who enjoy these movies that that some are  in DVD, some in VHS, and the first is in limbo.  However, eventually  they'll all be out in DVD.
For now, I ordered all three in VHS format  recently 'somewhere' - the first remains the best and our favorite, but you  really have to have them all if you're going to fully enjoy them.
These  movies are GREAT for the whole family to watch - we did these as a marathon  one week-end, and was it fun.  The first one is still the favorite, but  that's because it lays the groundwork for this one and the next.
Just a  little heads up for parents of young kids -I was surprised in watching this  for the umpteenth time, but with a mom's eye and ear, to hear several  really unnecessary cusswords scattered throughout all three movies. Oh,  nothing to bad, but they could have been left out entirely.  My 8-year  old's eyes popped open - he knows that swear words are kind of a lazy  person's short cut for saying what they want to - usually used by those low  in vocabulary, weak on creative expression - but we just frowned a little,  scratched our heads, and decided not to worry.
For those who don't have  kids and think I'm being too prissy, just wait til ya have kids of your  own!",960854400,5,2279,4.225581395348837
367598,5,630179513X,"Although this one may seem a bit slow in some parts, it is still one the best adventure/commedy movies ever made. In my opinion, the first film is the best in that category.  There is a great love story, many hilarious  moments, tons of suspense and action.  I can watch Back to the Future films  again and again and I never get tired of them. A classic.",953424000,,354,4.2388059701492535

This film is fantastic.  I don't care what any other people say it is.  Its not nearly as good as  the original, thats true, but what sequel is? I think any one eho gives  this movie less than one star is expecting to much.",953251200,3,414,4.061728395061729
