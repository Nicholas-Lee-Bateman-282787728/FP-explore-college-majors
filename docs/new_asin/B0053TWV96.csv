8455757,5,B0053TWV96,"As with any collection there are high points and some not so high, but with 300 of the best cartoons ever made, and most totally forgotten or only available in scratchy blurry copies, this is a welcome gift from above!

My favorites are the flawless Superman shorts, some better than others but the best of them are as good as it gets.  The Betty Boop shorts are so clear and good they have to be from direct masters which were kept in very a good climate all these years.

There are 3 long form Popeye shorts that are the best I have seen them, the colors are great and I can imagine how it must have been back in the theater days.  Popeye still mumbles and that is how it was recorded, I always thought it was bad copies but that is how he talked in those old shorts!

There is an old public service type cartoon from American Lung Association about not smoking that is great, with dragons and such, really may have been the precursor to How to train your dragon, you never know.

There is so much to see here and yes some are pretty bad, but with 300 to see and all in such a great display case, with 10 full length DVDs and the history displayed in the set, everyone can find at least 200 they love and the rest, well they are interesting too!

I suggest getting this one if you are a collector, the other massive PD sets are compressed so there is no chance of good viewing on todays sets, they really did this one right, the full resolution makes the great one better and well those not so great ones are a good as they are going to get.

This is the collection of the oldies for the ages!

PS can you tell I liked this collection",1395705600,5,1636,4.151898734177215
8455758,5,B0053TWV96,Product was great! Loved everything about it! Lots of hours of great cartoons to enjoy! Would recommend to any classic cartoon lovers!,1361664000,,134,5.136363636363637
8455759,5,B0053TWV96,"This set contains some of the best cartoons ever made. The cartoons in this set are beautifully restored and better than they have been in years. I remember seeing many of these cartoons in faded TV prints made in the 1960s. Dr. Thomas R. Reich and North Hampton Partners have spent millions restoring these classic works, and Mr. Reich, in particular, has spent nearly his entire life devoted to researching the information on the various studios and spending every penny possible on ressurecting these films for new audiences. Yes sirree, this is the definitive set of classic animation and I am proud to recommend this set to any fan of classic animation.",1353974400,2,658,4.883928571428571
8455760,1,B0053TWV96,"I got this DVD two years ago, and I was pretty excited to get it. I first believed the term, ""Digitally restored sound and color"", when I saw it. But of course, of usual, I was freakin RIPPED OFF! It seems more like ""Digitally TAMPERED color and sound."" It is the same transfers with the added sound by Goodtimes! If you want a decent collection, get the Thunderbean DVDs. The original sound is tons of times better then the sound in this set. Finally this weekend, I got so tired of it, I ripped the whole thing up! I will never get a Goodtimes, or a dvd like this again with new added sound!!! Please, please, please save your money!!!!!",1353888000,,639,4.333333333333333
8455761,5,B0053TWV96,"I highly recommend you purchase this collection before it goes up in price again.  Since I last bought it in December 2011 there has been a price increase of almost $5.00.  That is a 25% increase.

But these Max Fleischer cartoons are great fun!  On the box it says ""...fully restored color and clear, vibrant sound!""

Well, not quite.  In fact many of these look like no form of restoration has touched them.  BUT I would not recommend waiting around for some imaginary ""pristine"" restoration -- it ain't coming.  These ""cartoons"" are a magical carpet ride back to the 30's and 40's.  All of the Superman cartoons are here.  Some believe they are the best animated Superman because of the Art Deco approach.  But that ""Popeye Sing-Along"" is rare and enjoyable.  Don't forget Casper, Betty Boop, Felix the Cat, Little Lulu and the whole gang!

These are 36 HOURS of our American Heritage.  Enjoy them while they are available.",1331251200,3,926,4.7421383647798745
8455762,1,B0053TWV96,"Despite this collection's rather substantial packaging, sheer quantity of cartoons, and claim to feature ""restored"" versions of these ubiquitous cartoon classics, I can't recommend it at all -- even at such an inexpensive price. First of all, of the cartoons I sampled, these are the same poor transfers that have been circulating on budget-priced VHS tapes and DVDs for years, complete with jerky splices, tape mistrackings, etc. That by itself isn't so bad -- I don't mind the relatively poor image quality -- what really bothers me is that the soundtracks of those I sampled have been tampered with. In Ub Iwerks's ""Balloon Land,"" the producers of this set saw fit to dub in all kinds of irritating sound effects not in the original cartoon! Some of these newly-added sound effects cover up the wonderful original music that makes these cartoons so enjoyable. Not only that, but the audio quality of the added sound effects is so markedly different from the audio quality of the original soundtrack that it's very distracting and obvious. Why oh why can't they keep their grubby little hands off these animated gems? I would have preferred an unrestored poor-quality dub of the original, unedited, unmolested cartoon to these bastardized versions. I'll be returning my set and sticking with the dollar store DVDs I bought ten years ago.",1325289600,8,1339,5.036036036036036
8455763,4,B0053TWV96,"The ONLY way to see any Max Fleisher cartoons, many of which haven't been seen since the old Betty Boop Republic Laserdiscs some 15 years ago. Ignore the previous review, from someone who apparently has his own agenda.

Until these cartoons get the fully restored, Jerry Beck approved treatment, this is the ONLY way to see them. Sing Along With Popeye ALONE is worth the price for it's rareness...",1320796800,,398,4.768115942028985
8455764,1,B0053TWV96,"I had high hopes for this set since it said on the front of the box that all the cartoons had restored color and sound. While that may be true for the color and sound which I did not notice, the video quality was as if it had been copied from old VHS video tape. Really bad!.  I compared it to my Harvey cartoon box set and the difference was glaring. Do not buy unless you just need to entertain some 5 year olds.",1318291200,3,414,3.9285714285714284
