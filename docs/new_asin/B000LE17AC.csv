2708517,4,B000LE17AC,"I did this DVD this morning and I have to say that I did work up a sweat.  You have a choice between a 45 or 30 minute workout followed by a yoga-lite stretch.  The dances are routines to 9 songs and the class builds in intensity with each song and then cools downs with the last song. If you have thick pile carpet as I do, you won't be able to move as freely as the dancers do.  There are a couple of pivots,chasses and turns.

Music:  Techno world beat music. Very rhythmic and earthy. Think Shiva Rea Trance Dance type music.  However, it wasn't loud enough for me.  I do my workouts in the morning and I can't turn up the TV too loud for fear of waking up my spouse.  I could barely hear the music  over the teacher.  I gave it 4 stars for this.  Great world beat music but you can't hear it unless your TV is very loud or you have surround sound speakers, which I don't have. Also she doesn't have a music only option, so I went on omstream and calabashmusic and downloaded 7 of the 9 songs, bought 1 album (Dance, Dream Dance)Because I like Shaman's Dream, and put the music on my ipod. I turn the sound down and listen to the music in my ears.  When you hear the music in stereo with heart beating bass, you can feel it in your soul.  I wish you could feel that on the DVD.  Sometimes the music is out of sync with the DVD on mute, but if you pause the DVD and start up again you can usually get it back in sync, and anyway I know the routine so well that I dance facing away from the tv screen.  This may seem like a lot of effort but I tell you that this music is meant to be heard LOUD. Especially the Bob Holroyd song.  That song jams!!.  I think that soundstrue should re-do the DVD with the music louder than the teacher and extra bass. Or at least a music only option!!!!!!!!!!!!

Setting:  6 dancers (I think, with 1 guy in the back)  No professional dancers here, just regular folks in a hardwood floor studio.

Routine:  Loved it.  A cross between jazz, modern, african and latin dance moves. Again very earthy.  No ballet here. You feel it in your lower and upper body. Lots of arm movements. Ths is like a Nia class.  In fact Chantal is a Nia certified teacher. After each routine segment there is a short free form segment to keep you moving until the next song.  You never stop moving. I didn't know how out of shape I was, because I had to stop several times to catch my breath.  There is a separate tutorial that teaches you all of the routines.  Didn't look at that as I follow  along pretty well.  One more thing, she DOES NOT do mirror image to you.  When she says left or right she is talking about her left or right NOT yours.  But the moves are so simple that you can just go in the direction she does.

What's missing:  In my opinion what is missing from this class was a good floor routine.  The yoga stretching at the end didn't do it for me. It consists of deep squat, side warrior, open legged stretches, butterfly, thread the needle and child's pose. I was so warmed up that some ab work and intense stretching would have been perfect.  In a Nia class they have something called floorplay that Chantal didn't include on this DVD.  Next time I do the class, I will use Core abs & forward bends from Shiva Rea's fluid power DVD as her type of dancey yoga is a perfect compliment to this DVD. One other suggestion is, if after the deep sweat you need more, you can put on Shiva Rea's Trance dance and bliss out some more. I felt that I needed just a little more bliss.

Overall:  Will I do this again? YES! Will just add my own stretches at the end.  I hope she comes out with another DVD soon! (See my review on ""Dancer's Body workout, Patricia Moreno""  Take note, Soul Sweat is what a dance workout DVD should be!!!)",1171756800,38,3751,4.147018030513176
2708518,5,B000LE17AC,"This DVD has become an instant favourite of mine - it's everything I never knew I wanted in a workout!

Chantal has created an amazing DVD that features a great world music soundtrack and focuses on getting you to ""feel your rhythm"" and express yourself however it feels right. The choreography is based on simple steps that will still provide a challenge as you learn them, but the great thing is that, even if you mess up a step, it still feels natural and you just keep on moving.

The DVD includes an instruction chapter, taking you through the basic steps and combinations. For a workout, you have a choice between the 45-minute Deep Sweat or a 30-minute Quick Sweat (an edited version of Deep Sweat). Both of these are followed by a flowing, yoga-inspired stretch section.

Time definitely seems to fly during this inspiring workout, and I always work up a sweat. The ability to make the movements as large or as small as you need means that this will suit a variety of fitness levels; I consider myself a fairly solid intermediate and see there's still plenty of room left to challenge myself.

I can't wait for Chantal to bring out more DVDs like this one.",1170460800,6,1164,4.581730769230769
2708519,5,B000LE17AC,"This video is full of fun and beautiful dancing.  It actually does get the heart rate up too.  Chantal is great, and there's plenty of variety.  I love to dance, and I like the soulful, earthy feel of her style.",1167696000,3,211,4.225
2708530,2,B000LE17AC,"I used to dance and I did a lot of aerobics, but this DVD required more space than I have in my apartment. She's fun and it's upbeat, but it wasn't my thing. Too many steps (and I used to dance, surely I should be able to manage that), but that also means you have to pay so much attention to the routines, it hardly is a workout anymore.",1359676800,3,338,3.9130434782608696
2708531,5,B000LE17AC,I bought this for my mom for Christmas.  She is very fit and does a lot of NIA and runs half marathons and still felt like this video kicked her butt.  The music is pretty good.,1357171200,,177,3.888888888888889
2708532,5,B000LE17AC,"I cannot believe that an exercise video can be this fantastic.

I pretty much hate to move. I'm the laziest person on the planet. I have never actually enjoyed a workout video, and I thought I had pretty tried all of the genres.  The only exercise I've ever stuck with for any length of time was *actual* kickboxing - sparring, not that cardio stuff.  Blech.

Whatever it is Chantal is doing - not quite Nia, but Nia-esque, perhaps - is pure gold.  Sexy, fun, powerful, vital free...challenging and rigorous, yet somehow just a joy to do.  I'm not New-Agey at all.  I don't do yoga or Nia or meditate.  I'm a scientist and I play video games.

But this is something special.  I feel wonderful during it.  I've even laughed out loud.  I walk on air all through the next day. I've never seen anything like it, and I hope with all my heart that she makes more (and more and more) of these.  Chantal is charismatic and and likeable. She's not over the top at all, and yet her energy seems contagious.  She can really move, and she's beautiful to watch, but it's not the least bit intimidating.  It's highly versatile also; I can increase or decrease the intensity during each song as I wish, and I can choose a 46-minute workout, a 30-minute workout, or do the entire DVD (which includes a stretching section).

I'm the first one to look askance at people who use positive descriptors for their workout experiences. Honestly, though - and this is coming from someone whose favorite workout involves hitting people - this is just pure bliss.

Thank you, Chantal!  And please, please make more!",1338508800,3,1588,4.570921985815603
2708533,4,B000LE17AC,"I bought this DVD and expected it to be a tad on the easy side.....boy was I wrong! I was sweating like crazy towards the end, and smiling, which is a good thing. I liked how there is a lengthy explanation of the moves before the workout if you want, or you can skip through it and get down to business. There is a 45 min and 30 min option. At the end there is a nice yoga stretch that leaves you feeling relaxed and energized. I would recommend this video to anyone looking to add some variety to their DVD rotation.",1311897600,2,517,4.078431372549019
2708534,5,B000LE17AC,"And have fun doing it? If so then don't walk but run to get ""Soul Sweat!"" This video is great for wanting something different in your usual workout routine. It's fun and it will make you sweat away those calories. I burned 648 calories doing the 45 minute routine! I also like that it ends with a Yoga routine stretch ! I'd highly recommend ""Soul Sweat!""

Overall rating: 10.0",1310342400,,376,4.449275362318841
2708535,5,B000LE17AC,"I've enjoyed dancing along with this video. After following the practice steps, the dance video itself is very easy to follow. The pace during the practice section is just right, nice and slow, and the dance part is fast enough to work up a sweat but not so fast that I can't keep up.",1290297600,2,284,4.277777777777778
2708536,4,B000LE17AC,"This was actually what I was looking for....something more dance-oriented, less dance-aerobics.  It worked up a sweat and I can see how it can be amped up for more of a workout.  It may not be for someone who likes high-intensity dancing though.",1275868800,2,245,4.674418604651163
2708537,5,B000LE17AC,"I was in a crisis; I needed to lose weight and I was desperate. My friends let me borrow all sorts of workout videos and I even wasted money on this stupid Latin dance workout video which  wasn't really effective. Finally, I bought ""Soul Sweat"" and before I knew it I was working out with it every other day and even managed to lose some weight too. You have a choice between a 30 or 45 minute and Chantal even has a 20 minute tutorial that shows you each and every one of her dance moves so you don't start a session cold turkey.
I hate the gym, and I hate running because it feels like a chore but I'm always excited about ""Soul Sweat"". I love doing it at the end of the day so I can shake off all the tension and get a good night's sleep. ""Soul Sweat"" is definitely not your average workout video buy it now!",1257984000,5,811,4.037267080745342
2708538,5,B000LE17AC,To tell the truth at first I thought this workout was kind of weird but I've kept trying it and I really enjoy it when I'm in the right mood for it.  It really opens up my hips and allows me to stretch further afterword. There have been comments that the music isn't loud enough but I didn't think it was a problem until later when I learned the moves better and didn't need as much instruction; now it would be nicer to have the music a bit louder but it won't keep me from doing the workout.  I wish she had more workouts.  I like her combining of different dance styles although I have two left feet and it took me awhile to learn them and am still learning them them fuller and better.  You have a lot of freedom to change the moves if you need to for whatever reason. I feel like I can keep doing this workout and learn something new each time.,1245196800,4,849,4.065868263473054
2708539,5,B000LE17AC,I enjoyed doing this dance workout. Easy on the knees. Nice music. Not too difficult,1232582400,,84,4.666666666666667
2708550,4,B000LE17AC,"This workout did make me sweat.  And the moves were simple enough to follow.  There is a section on the DVD where she breaks down the steps, which may be helpful.  But I did the workout without that primer, and I followed the routine just fine.
However, I didn't find myself having a lot of fun.  It felt sort of like I was in a dance aerobics class.  For some reason, I was expecting a little more ""free"" form dancing or something that didn't feel so much like ""exercise"".",1222387200,2,473,4.269662921348314
2708551,4,B000LE17AC,"The workout is fantastic, though the moves themselves might be a bit challenging if you've never taken any dance classes.  The reason I rated this 4 stars rather than 5 is due to the intensely annoying intro sequence.  You have to go through a lot of music and graphics to finally get to the ""press start"" button - so much so that I find my blood pressure rising before the workout even begins.",1209340800,4,394,4.383561643835616
2708552,5,B000LE17AC,"I like to do workouts when I am inspired by the instructor's own body. Every dancer on this DVD has a midsection to aspire to and my own has improved since doing this workout. Like another reviewer, I wanted to supplement Ana Brett and Ravi Singh's Dance the Chakras and this tape makes a great companion to that workout. The moves on SoulSweat invite indivdual interpretation and spontaneous response. It is difficult enough to make you sweat but fun enough to want to do again and again. No difficult moves here, but it is not a belly dance routine, more of a cross between yoga and jazz dance. You can get a great workout the first time, but unlike some ""freeform"" workouts that get boring after one or two times, I am just as enthusiastic about doing SoulSweat now as I was when I bought it, a month ago. Personally I love the music and find it inspiring, especially for doing this type of dance. I recommend.",1194480000,6,913,4.473053892215569
2708553,4,B000LE17AC,"I saw this DVD recommended in a magazine and I love it.  It is really fun and the 45 minutes go by in a flash.  It is exercise that doesn't feel like exercising, which is great for me.  I love yoga and this definitely has elements of yoga in it.  The music is nice too--earth dance/rhythms type music.  If you buy this, check out the token male in the back row--he is hilarious!",1190160000,4,378,4.123287671232877
2708554,4,B000LE17AC,"I love this dvd!  First, I grew up dancing so the moves seem fairly easy to me.  However, there is an awesome tutorial section and if dance does not come naturally to you, going through this tutorial several times will make you feel more confident.

Second, if you truly put your all into the workout, you will sweat and burn calories.  I am not an athlete but have exercised for 3 years on a consistent basis.  Therefore, I think this workout is challenging for all people at all levels of fitness.  All muscle groups are used, and if you are not as fit, you can eliminate or scale down some of the moves.

Unlike many other dance videos, the people in the one actually sweat too!!  Also, Chantal reminds you to breathe often which sounds silly, but is so important.  She also tells you when to exhale and when to inhale.

Again, if you put your all into it, you will work all muscle groups and its really fun.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because as a Christian, I don't agree Chantal's ""spiritual"" take on dance.  Otherwise, its a great workout!",1185840000,7,1064,4.372448979591836
2708555,5,B000LE17AC,"I'm so glad I bought this DVD. Like a fellow Aussie reviewer, I was looking for something similar to Ana Brett and Ravi Singh's Dance the Chakras. And there are some similarities - barefoot dancing, very accessible dance movements that feel so good to do; wonderful instruction; great music. You'll sweat a lot more with Chantal's workout though because it's very aerobic. At times you may feel like stopping, but the music and dance will compel you to go on.

My only complaint (which other reviewers share) is the volume of the music. It's slightly softer than I would have liked.

I hope Chantal releases some more DVDs. She's a great instructor and dancer.",1179792000,9,660,4.780701754385965
2708556,5,B000LE17AC,"This is a great workout if you are looking to sweat, not have any breaks as you are dancing hard/fast & know you are picky about great music to dance by that puts you in a great mood.
There is a 20 min tutorial with no music where Chantal alone shows you all the moves & the 12+ combos you will do. This is a little slow/boring, but it she breaks it down so well, anyone could get it so when you do the dancing, you know you'll get it easy, just a question of getting use to the speed. The dances are quite simple have have things such as easy steps like grapevine, v/square step, box step, cha-cha, chasse (easy stepping 2x quickly), plies, 2 different basic turns, etc. All these steps feel great since they are easy to do, but really strech your muscles at the same time really work the abs/obliques as well as the legs. She adds a lot of arm movements so your arms & chest get the same treatment & you really open up.
There are two workouts, quick sweat (30 min) & Deep Sweat (45 min). Tehre are 5 women & 1 man. Chantal & all the dancers have quick text bios in the  bonus section & they are everyday people who love to dance.
The music is the strong suit, she had a great marketing idea to get great music that normally musicians didn't in the past want to be used by fitness dvds & making sure the names of the group & song are featured so you can buy them. The music is very positive & help put you in a better mood. Chantal does a great job of only speaking to tell you what moves are next or only every so often, remind you of the energy your body is producing that doesn't get in your way of connecting to the music.
I had no problem hearing the music though, yes, it could be louder in relation to her sound level.
There is also a 13 min stretch chapter that uses (not in this order)  mountain, standing fwd bends, Indian style bending fwd, butterfly, sitting wide legged side stretching & torso to side stretch, kneeling arm to the side stretch, side angle & child's pose. The pace was slow & relaxed & did feel good, though, as another said, short.

You can see a trailer at soundstrue & soon at her site soulsweatdance.",1176595200,16,2134,4.162227602905569
2708557,2,B000LE17AC,"The sound on this dvd is terrible.  The routine isn't bad, it's very NIA, i.e. if you have any NIA workouts you have this - except there's no floorplay, which is a pity.  I love the music on the NIA routines, and bought this because of all the reviewers who said the music was awesome.  It would be, if you could hear it.  Don't know why she didn't include a music only option - this could have been a video, not a dvd, for all the use of its technology.  Anyway, even turned up really loud you can only hear her voice.  This is going up for trade.",1175644800,6,548,4.027777777777778
2708558,5,B000LE17AC,"I really love this workout.  The more comfortable I get with the steps, the more I am able to use variations and self expression. This is definately not your traditional cardio, just what I was looking for. I also love the music and the way it flows with the moves.

The moves are earthy, easy to do, and fun. Chantal has awesome abs. I would give it 5 stars but the stretching/yoga section was not very good and I like to feel the music pulse through me when I dance and in this one I couldn't turn it up without her voice blasting as well.

8161803,4,B000LE17AC,"I wanted to try this workout because I am into low impact, laid back workouts these days. I had a really bad fitness year last year and I'm coming back.

I really, really wanted to like this workout, but the vibe just wasn't for me. I am someone who regularly says, ""Tell me the rules and I'll follow them."" Once I know what I'm doing with something, I have no problem breaking the rules and taking chances, but only when it's from a comfortable place. I am not a dancer and need someone to tell me what to do. In this workout, she says to feel the freedom in your body and to express yourself while I'm just trying to figure out the moves.

For someone who doesn't have these hang ups, this could be an excellent workout, because it's really well done. She has a tutorial that goes through the moves, so that you can learn them. It's clear and helpful. It didn't help me because in putting it together I just felt uncomfortable, but for many it would be enough. The workout is sort of organized free expression based on the moves she shows you. In the workout, she is backed up by multiple background exercisers, all of whom have a different style and different moves. There's no need for a modifier because she gives different options and the range is demonstrated by the various people doing the workout. The music is well suited to the workout.

For someone into free expression based on specific moves, this is a great workout. For those who just want someone to tell them what to do and how to move, maybe not so much.",1423699200,,1524,4.3780918727915195
8161804,4,B000LE17AC,"Update 1/12/16: After giving this video another chance, I realized I have to go back and change my review and give it an extra star. When I first tried it and wrote the review, I had just finished watching the step guide portion, and it left me with a feeling that highly influenced my review and thoughts on the main video portion, as you can read below. When I went back and did it again recently WITHOUT WATCHING THE STEP GUIDE,  I realized that my assessment was not fully fair, and I'll explain what I mean: In the step guide, the teacher is indeed extremely serious as I wrote in my review, and it leaves a very heavy and cold feeling that just didn't seem conducive to the point of the entire video. It made me feel like the video was just ""trying too hard"" and was inauthentic, or something. Like it was so stiff and contrived, when the point was to learn to be free and expressive in your movements. It ruined the whole thing for me.  But if you just do the video without having just watched the step guide, then you see the teacher actually IS more smiley, a bit more lively and lighthearted, and it was easier to get into the groove and energy of the video. It was much more fun this last time and made me want to return to it again. So, I bumped it up to 4 stars. :-)

Old review:
If you feel really tight in your dance, and need to loosen up, this might be a good video for you to try out. It's very good quality, very nice setting, beautiful to watch, etc. If you've never taken any kind of ""creative movement"" class and want to experience more flow in movement, you might also want to give this a try. If you like world-trancy type music, you will like the music on this DVD.

But, I have mixed feelings about this DVD. I REALLY appreciate the intent and the beauty of the whole thing, and I used to be really into this whole kind of ""tribal"" dance scene, but now it just seems old, tired, and done to me. She tells people to find their own form of movement and expression, but when she says that, everyone in the video is just doing practically the exact same swirling their arms around movements that I guess are supposed to appear unique and exotic. But instead of looking like they're unleashing their own creative movement, they just look ""trying too hard to be different and tribal"" to me. It would be better if when she says that, they would all break off into their own completely different moves.

I do like the puppet dance move...that would be fun to just play around with on the dance floor when goofing around with friends. :-)

This is not a video that will give you a super great workout, if you're used to dance and working out. Think of this as an earthy, sort of exotic, Nia-like, yoga/mellow dance video. Yeah, you do get moving fast in some parts of it, but I still don't think people who are really fit will get a great workout from it. It's still fun though.

One last thing: the instructor is SO SERIOUS for so much of the video. Which is odd, because this is supposed to be a video about freedom of expression, playfulness, and fun...but she's stone-faced almost the entire time she's showing moves in the step guide portion, as well as through much of the beginning.  I think if she was much more lighthearted and smiley the video would have a more warm, playful feel to it, and I would enjoy it way more and be so much less mixed about it.  But it just feels so HEAVY and COLD and SERIOUS; which in the end ruins the whole vibe for me that it's supposed to be going for and creates what feels like a discord in the whole feel of the video. At one point far into it she does start smiling while dancing and the other dancers start wooping a bit...but by then, the seriousness of the whole thing building up to that point just makes it hard for me to really feel free and open while I'm doing the video.

I dunno, I realize I'm giving a complete mixed review here, and it's probably not very helpful.  Overall, if you're thinking of getting this video, just do it. If you like Nia, you will like this video.

You can tell a lot of effort went into the making of this video, and for that they did a great job. :-)",1422576000,2,4151,4.247148288973384

the routine is pretty easy to understand and the instructions to follow it are clear.  After doing it a few times, following the instructions should be even easier and not require too much concentration.  There is a full 45 min workout and an option for a shorter 30 min workout which is nice when you're pressed for time.

I take Nia classes on the weekend.  This will be a good video to use a couple times during the week in between classes.  I prefer it to the Nia DVDs I've tried at home.",1366761600,2,619,4.247863247863248
