8534716,3,B0001CVDZS,I was mesmerized by this movie when I was a teen. David Jansen plays the father perfectly! It's on VHS with the old clamshell case and felt like it had been a shelf for the last 30 years. Movie feels really dated and not as good to watch today. Was worth the trip down memory lane for the price!,1359072000,,295,4.016949152542373
8534717,5,B0001CVDZS,"This movie is all time great! It dealt with misunderstandings, feelings and most importantly trust. Robie Benson was brilliant as Richie and how he fought for his father's love just as much as his addiction to drugs. That funeral scene always has me grabbing for a Kleenex!",1178841600,,273,4.829787234042553
