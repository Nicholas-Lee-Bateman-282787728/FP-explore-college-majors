5910718,5,B00EF0NYA4,"This fascinating series takes the viewer on a journey from the beginnings of photography through the intricate modern digital age with emphasis on both the scholarly and the creative aspects of catching a moment and preserving it.  In a relatively short period of time, photography has gone from an experimental novelty, the plaything of the wealthy, to a scientific data recording mechanism for a variety of fields of study.  Even more intriguing is has also become a tool for creating amazing works of art, and is absolutely a part of everyone's daily life.  The series PHOTO captures the drama and the art involved in photographs, exploring the ""how"" of the process and the intensity involved in recording moments.  We learn about photographers and the thought that goes into the creation of a photograph that ""speaks"" to the viewer artistically and emotionally.  Everything is the subject of photographs, depending on the intent of the photographer.  The nude body is portrayed as well as Earth shattering events in our history, captured as the photographer saw them and wanted us to see them.  A treat for those serious about photography, either as media persons or artists.",1385510400,7,1179,5.077720207253886
5910719,5,B00EF0NYA4,"""PHOTO"" series is loaded with photography history, and hundreds of images. Simple animation and overlays are used to embellish the educational presentation in this documentary. A good series for those within or studying to become a part of the photo and computer imaging industry. Old techniques can be used in today's digital world. Although some processes are explained, this is primarily about the creative aspect of image capturing. Art schools and universities will enjoy this.

It's a French production (audio in English) consisting of European and some US history. The narrator, Mathieu Demy, sometimes adds supposition to his docent presentation [writer: Stan Neomann] causing the viewer to decipher between historical fact and the writer's subjectivity. Not a hard task even for the novice. Nude photo images frequent, a traditional image type in art.

SDH SUBTITLES for all 12 26-min episodes.
1 Surrealist Photography-- In 1928 came the ""selfie."" A self-portrait opportunity inside a box. Of course Dali grasps the potential. Many B/W artistic images of the 1930s.
2 The Primitives of Photography, 1850-1860-- Photo artistry interpreting reality. Early pre-industrialized photographs and war imagery. 1839 Daguerreotype; single non-reproducible image on copper.
3 The New German Objectivity-- the Dusseldorf school in 1960, a lead to today's digital manipulations capability. Objectivity, especially in industrial photography.
4 Staged Photography-- Scripting the image the camera captures. Computer manipulation of lies, fiction, and enhancement.
5 Press Usage-- Media photo use is as diverse as media forms and ad imagination.
6 Pictorialism-- Lab work inspires beyond the mechanical lens ability seeking a painterly style of photo acceptable to the art world.
7 New Vision: Experimental Photography of the 1920s-- Photo rules of the 1920s included diagonals and non-Renaissance perspective truths. Modern vantage points prevail as ""the new vision.""
8 Photographing Intimacy-- Private moments--the subjective influence on capturing people and personalities. Voyeurism now an art.
9 The Inventors-- Daguerreotypes inspired commissioned portraits. These ""likenesses"" create a new professional.
10 Found Images-- Found picture images of the past become the media of the photomontage. Old idea in new forms. No mention of copyright infringement concerns in Paris.
11 Conceptual Photography-- the 1960s conceptual movement is expression via photo images.
12 After the Photo-- Digital; the good, the bad, the ugly. Photo manipulation reigns as king.

Not the final word in photography, but certainly a good documentary for those in this field of interest. I learned a lot, even though I'm only a point-&-shoot shutter bug.",1383264000,10,2729,5.716748768472907

8604874,3,B00EF0NYA4,"Just my opinion.... Great idea but the ""fun"" graphics which seemed pretty cool in the beginning were so repetitive and disruptive that I finally stopped watching. I really just wanted to see the work and learn the history - which is there -  but, for me, they tried too hard with the cute sound effects and bells and whistles that I got the feeling they imagined that viewers would fall asleep without constant modern touches to make still images move.",1499990400,2,452,4.65

8604880,1,B00EF0NYA4,"I teach photo history at a community college and purchased this DVD out of pocket to supplement lecture material and the textbook for my students. What a colossal disappointment! I must have failed to read in the description (somewhere ?) that it is designed for elementary school students. It is very very  ""cute"" and uses graphic tricks such as moving parts of the subject around within the photograph with accompanying sound effects (slide whistle) in an attempt, I suppose, to make it more interesting to a dumbed down audience. It's ""graphics gone wild"" with sliding/swiping bars constantly moving across the screen. I wouldn't dare show this to junior high students, much less in a college setting. I realize that this review differs greatly from the glowing report of others. My copy is for sale...",1440633600,7,805,5.007462686567164

8604882,5,B00EF0NYA4,"I was pleasantly delighted - and then captivated- by this documentary when it popped up as an Instant Movie option. It is one of a 12 episode set. I want to note up front that I have no connection to the film, its producers, etc. I simply stumbled upon it while browsing through movie choices.

The episode on surrealistic photography starts with a look at how photographers used instant photo booths for experiments in manipulating viewers' perceptions of reality. The photos were snapped in the type of photo booths that used to be common in malls and department stores. Photos cost a quarter ( as I recall). Until seeing the film, I didn't realize these had been around as early as 1928.

After the introductory  photo booth section, the documentary focuses on the other forms of surrealist photos as well as what messages or information the photographers may have been trying to convey.  Some objects and people. are photographed just as found. A dress hanging outside to dry, when seen through the eyes of an astute photographer, looks as though it is inhabited by an invisible spirit.

And then there are those images which seem taken directly from life but are manipulated by the photographer (subtly or overtly),perhaps photographed in reverse or with the photographer's finely crafted illusions that aren't obvious from a casual first glance at the photo.

I was fascinated to learn about the techniques and experimentation used to create many of the images: intentional double images, unusual cropping, solarization, etc. Some of the experiments failed most of the time, with some rare gems here and there.

And then there is the quality of the documentary itself. The filmmakers  somehow managed to take still photography and reveal its magic - and then added vivid live action shots or animated scenes which added extra interest. All of this occurs without detracting from the photos themselves.

Now, perhaps the ""elephant in the room"" question: aren't these episodes very short and relatively pricey? To that I can only answer that I've watched many longer documentaries which didn't provide nearly as much info. I didn't feel a second of my time was wasted .
And if you purchase the entire season, there is a significant savings (at least as of the time of this review).",1412208000,3,2285,4.945169712793733
