8143950,5,B000I4ZDAK,"I love to dance so this dvd was right up my ally.  Donna did an excellent job.  If you love to dance, than this is the video for you.  I felt like I was having a party in my living room, because she really brings it all alive, along with the others in the dvd.",1447286400,2,260,3.690909090909091
8143951,5,B000I4ZDAK,I enjoyed this workout from start to finish. I even did it with a few friends and we had a ball. I definitely recommend.,1396828800,,120,4.041666666666667
8143952,5,B000I4ZDAK,Oh ny goodness.  Where to start.  This video is the bomb. com.  Donna Richardson engages you at the beginning of workout.  She makes sure to keep reminding us to make sure you are not putting your health at risk.  Loved Gospel workout video but this one feels like u r just dancing taking off wait to music and an exercise that is REALLY fun.  You get flashbacks to partying in the 70's,1363910400,2,386,4.291666666666667
8143953,5,B000I4ZDAK,I enjoy working out to this tape. The old school music is great. I remember the dances just like yesterday.,1341360000,,107,4.4
8143954,5,B000I4ZDAK,"This dvd makes me smile when I exercise!  This is also the dvd that causes my family to join me in exercising! First, the Sugar Hill Gang is performing during the entire workout!  The music is at just the right level.  Second Donna Richardson leads a diverse group of smiling and laughing women through a 45 minute walking-dance workout.

Interestingly, the pace is not as fast as my other walking workouts.  I think it is because you are moving to the pace of the Sugar Hill Gang's music.  The atmosphere of this video is upbeat yet so relaxed that if you don't get the exact step you just keep movin' and clappin until the next step.

I feel it is a good value for my money because of the superb quality of the production and the length of the workout which is 45 minutes.

Donna Richardson-Joyner cues well and the dance moves are simple and will bring back ""old school"" memories.

They do a Soul Train line at the end! You will sweat and smile. Get this one while it is still available.",1334361600,2,990,4.366120218579235
8143955,5,B000I4ZDAK,"OMG!  This dvd is the bomb & 1st cousins with ZUMBA lol.  I was too out of sync and mis-stepping with my Wii Zumba, but wanted a dance workout, so I went old school and popped in @DonnaRJoyner - Donna's Old School Dance Party with Sugar Hill Gang performing live.  Although, I couldn't do the entire video step for step bcuz my stamina isn't there, I just did modified dancing until I was able to fall back into place.  I loved how at the end they free style danced & did a Soul Train line LOL>  My 4y old son& I kept taking turns with our extended from the tv Soul Train line.  I think this dvd was easier for me to do as a Black Woman, bcuz the music & dances our from my culture and time although I was born in the 70's.  It was so nostalgic, the songs, the dances & the SUgar Hill Gang.  I got to meet The Sugar Hill Gang at an OLD SCHOOL Halloween Party & they were so nice, fun & respectful, they even pulled me & my girlfriend (dressed as Salt & Pepa) on stage at the end of their performance to dance. I had these memories as I was exercising.  So...sorry, got off track for a 1min going back down memory lane lol.  Said all of that to say this, the dance moves came naturally to me bcuz I grew up doing or watching or around those dances, the music and the artists. I've been a fan of Donna Richardson before she became Donna Joyner lol. Also, it was nice seeing myself reflected.  In all my other workout dvd's, I am the minority.  Gonna make it on her husbabds/Tom Joyner cruise one day and dance with Donna lol.",1315094400,5,1523,4.073825503355705
8143956,5,B000I4ZDAK,I had this video and it is so much fun.  It's more like a party as opposed to a exercise tape.  I hope that it becomes available again.,1294790400,3,135,3.7857142857142856
