8324593,5,6302623359,"This is quite possibly one of the most underrated TV programs that I have ever seen. I'm surprised it isn't stocked up in video stores like it should be. This is one of the greatest programs that I've ever seen, and it's not only for kids but for adults/parents/teachers too. I highly recommend this videotape. This tape crosses gender, cultural, age, and racial barrier lines. This is a program for ALL to see. A sequel should have been made.",1042934400,3,443,4.620253164556962
