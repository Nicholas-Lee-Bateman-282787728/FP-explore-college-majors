7927433,4,B00004YRJN,"This series is one my favorites just because I find it so cute. The characters are very lovable, and though the female villan is...certianly not dressed appropriately for children, I think that this series could be enjoyed by more than just kids.
Anyone who likes cute anime (Pokemon, Cardcaptor Sakura, Digimon) will probably like this series to some degree. The plot is a bit repetative, but to the the characters are the main attraction anyway. ^_^
What I find lacking in these releases is the fact that it doesn't include a subtitled version of the original Japanese. All there is to watch is the dubbed version! Now the dub isn't bad as far as those go, but anyone who truely loves anime is going to be very upset that the original Japanese isn't included in this release.
I also feel that they should have released more than just three episodes on each disk.
If you can overlook those failings, then be sure and pick up a copy of this DVD. I'm sure you'll enjoy it! ^_^",1086220800,,975,4.545454545454546

The writers tried to give the characters a sense of humor but in doing so used the same gags and punchlines that everyone has come to identify and find as the epitamy of not funny.  I could forgive the film for its lack of thinking and character development if I could classified it as a very young children's movie; however, the way the main villainess was drawn with her luscious curves would leave me no choice but to forbid my children from seeing it.  All around, a horrible movie",985996800,,531,4.453608247422681
