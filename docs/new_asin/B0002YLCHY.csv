It never fails to make her smile and she dances along with the song at the end. She enjoys it and that's all that matters to me. It was money well spent.",1122768000,4,301,4.11864406779661
3901045,1,B0002YLCHY,"I am VERY sorry I didn't read reviews before buying this DVD.  It's an absolute waste of time - with lame stories, terrible production value, and a VERY expensive price.  They should pull these DVD's as they are so bad.",1113177600,6,219,4.45
3901046,1,B0002YLCHY,We received this as a gift for my 2 1/2 year old and it is awful.  I expected much more from Disney since they have always put out exceptional products and movies.  The Snow White version reminds of watching Godzilla with the uneven lip movements to her speech.  With today's technology Disney could have produced a much better DVD.  Do not waste your money.,1112745600,4,358,4.546875
3901047,2,B0002YLCHY,"I agree with everything the previous reviewer said. The Snow White cartoon is nothing more than a few still frames thrown together to form a semi-interactive story about making pies. The other two cartoons are full motion, but they feel even flatter than the Snow White slide show. These look like the typical dribble of afternoon cartoons being cranked out by writers who lack the time, talent, or inspiration to put a decent story together. There's so little in common with the original productions, that its hard to believe you're watching Disney.

From now on, I'll stick to their movies.",1109116800,21,592,4.92
3901048,2,B0002YLCHY,"I do not recommend the purchase of this dvd.  We anxiously awaited its release as it was touted as having a new Snow White cartoon.  Instead of creating a brand new cartoon, Disney used excerpts from the Snow White movie and rearranged them along with narration to create a new story.  At times, the characters are pictured talking on screen in still shots with no mouth movements.  There are some interactive features in the Snow White story which ask the child to make selections with the remote.  My daughter is 4 1/2 and doesn't use the remote.  I helped her make the choices, but she found it to be frustrating.  The Jasmine cartoon is one that Disney still shows in The Aladdin cartoon series reruns.  The Little Mermaid cartoon is also from the Little Mermaid cartoon series that still runs on Disney.  My daughter had seen the Aladdin and Little Mermaid cartoons on television previously.  This was a disappointing waste of money.",1109030400,45,938,4.734567901234568

3901050,1,B0002YLCHY,Terrible quality animation and story telling. Disney should be ashamed to have produced this blatant cash grab. Do not buy this. The animation quality if on par with old Hanna Barberra productions like Scooby Doo. Just awful.,1419552000,,225,5.108108108108108

3901052,4,B0002YLCHY,"My daughter is now 7 yrs going on 8 and she just asked me to watch this again.  She has had this movie now for a couple of years.  I had to come here and write a review since so many people have written such negative ones.  This review is based on her enjoyment of the DVD and the price, which I consider low, and also that I got my money's worth the first couple of times she's saw this.  She is a big Jasmine fan she was pleased to have her as one of the three stories.  In fact, I am here now searching for Vol 1 and Vol 3 and hope that she likes them as much as she likes this one.
If you're daughter is a Disney princess fan she is sure to like it.  It isn't however, a Disney classic so don't expect to to be.",1395100800,,715,3.7333333333333334
3901053,5,B0002YLCHY,"Disney Princess Stories: Vol. 2: Tales Of Friendship is the second chapter of the Disney Princess trilogy that is made for pre-schoolers. This volume features a Snow White ""interactive"" storybook tale and an Ariel and Jasmine story, each is an original episode of the 1993 Aladdin and 1995 Little Mermaid animated TV seires. The special features includes sneak peeks of other Disney DVD's for pre-schoolers, like JoJo's Circus, Bear In The Big Blue House, Mulan II and Disney Learning Adventures With Pooh. Disney Princess Stories, Vol. 2 is a perfect addition to any Disney DVD collection and just right for little girls. :)",1377043200,,625,5.077669902912621
3901054,5,B0002YLCHY,Received the DVD very quickly and in very good condition.  Granddaughter loves the Disney movies and thought this one was just great...Loved the fact she did not have to change the DVD to watch more than one movie.  Thanks for the great service and quality product.  Loretta Dinges,1371513600,,281,4.8125
3901055,1,B0002YLCHY,"I'm so disappointed in this DVD. My daughter loves the princesses and I was hoping to find her something that showed short stories starring them. Instead this DVD is just a compilation of existing clips from their movies set to different words as a ""story"". Snow White's story was the worst. And it included using the remote to ""participate"". My daugther is only 2.5! The stories totally lost her interest within minutes. I'm gonna stick with my full Disney animated classics.",1361577600,,476,4.888888888888889
3901056,5,B0002YLCHY,My Grandkids love this series of videos. They watch them over & over & over again. Always a hit when they come over.,1354320000,,116,4.086956521739131
3901057,3,B0002YLCHY,"As I stated in my review for the first volume of this series, maybe this isn't a 5-star production but it DEFINITELY doesn't deserve all the 1-star ratings that are on here and several reviews aren't even accurate descriptions of the product. Apparently people were expecting some big budget production on par with Disney's big screen counterparts and that's not the case, nor was it intended that way. This is a THEME DVD intended for CHILDREN focused on the importance of friendship, however I do feel it does a poor job in this regard. Many of those posting the negative reviews even admit that their children enjoy the stories. I also don't understand all the harsh comments regarding the quality. Some have pointed out that the two fully-animated stories are from TV shows and that's the kind of quality you get which isn't terrible. Disney has been reissuing TV episodes on DVD for years and still does. Again, this DVD features stories focused on a central theme targeted to elementary-aged children.

The first ""chapter"" is fully animated and portrays how Jasmine and the gang overcome the bad behaviours of some mischievious sprites. Unfortunately, as others have correctly pointed out, Jasmine isn't really featured here and doesn't play a major role which is disappointing based on the series' princess theme. It is not scary or inappropriate as some have stated.

The second chapter is presented in an anmimated read-along story book format but the words are not highlighted as they are spoken as in the first volume. Again, I don't see a major connection to the friendship theme here as it is mainly about Snow White making dinner for the dwarves. There are some interactive moments where you can use your remote to make a choice but the story will continue if you do nothing.

The third story is fully animated and shows how Ariel stops the evil Sea Witch from destroying and/or taking over her father's kingdom. It starts out with Ariel and her friend Gabriella but then Gabriella is essentially non-existant and I saw very little ""friendship"" moments during the show. The Sea Witch does create some ""scary"" situations but nothing I would view as being traumatizing for young children.

The bonus features include a music video, princess game and a craft activity.

Bottom line is, yes the quality is mediocre though it is made for younger children so it was not made to be spectacular in the eyes of an adult film critic. The friendship theme is really lost here but the stories can still be entertaining for younger children. The first volume is definitely better but this Volume 2 isn't terrible either.",1336176000,,2621,4.880898876404494
3901058,2,B0002YLCHY,"This is a cheaply made video by Disney.  I expected more from them with this.  Basically, taking clips from the old movies and cutting scense out with a voice dubbed story.  Please do not do like me and waste your money on this.",1332460800,,228,4.255813953488372
3901069,1,B0002YLCHY,"Very bad.  It never played in my DVD player.  Thought my player problem but tried 3 different DVD player but never worked.
I don't recommend to buy from this seller",1285632000,,164,4.433333333333334
3901070,5,B0002YLCHY,I bought this DVD for my niece who is obsessed with the Disney Princesses right now.  We have family in NJ and the drive can be very trying so now she can watch these on the way.,1272412800,,178,3.810810810810811
3901071,3,B0002YLCHY,"I truly expected a better effort from Disney. I am a huge Disney fan myself, my children love Disney films so we want to see that ""magic"" that makes their products famous.

The DVD has three stories. The first is more of an old Aladdin series tale than it is a princess tale. The story barely fits into the ""tales of friendship"" theme and quite frankly was a bit scary for little girls which is who Disney is trying to please anyway. Little spooky looking sprites that cause mischief and mayhem, fighting, chaos, and yelling that borders on swearing. The whole atmosphere is ridiculous and poorly animated to boot. I don't like the old Disney shows from the 90's but I also don't have anything against them. I just wish Disney had  remembered that these DVD's appeal to toddlers and little girls, NOT 13 year old's!!!!!!

All of the above applies to the third tale of Ariel. Spooky, inappropriate and another story that didn't fit well into the aforementioned theme. I was also upset to find a story in which a maniacal Ursula uses Ariels' treasures to cause panic and mayhem and then assume the role of Queen in return for ending the spell. ONCE AGAIN....way too age inappropriate.

The reason for the three stars is because my daughter (2) and my 4 year old son beg me to play the Snow White portion of the DVD! Many reviewers were disappointed to find that the Snow White tale wasn't a newly animated story, I was too, at first. In all honesty the clips, and the story book animation are all very charming and the DVD is interactive but also plays by itself if you leave it. My daughter has just enough time to stand up and run to the screen to point to the correct answer before the DVD continues on with the story. I would actually buy a DVD that had 3-4 storybook tales with minimal animation and sound storytelling narration and presentation. This portion was created directly for little girls which makes the other two upsetting and poor quality stories even more of a mystery. Rent this DVD for your little girl and play the Snow White story, I assure you she'll love it. I played this and the best clips of other Disney films for the girls at my son's birthday party two weeks ago and the whole party ended up sitting down and requesting us to ""do again, do again!""

If you are looking for a great princess DVD purchase for your little princess I highly recommend the sing along DVD's within this princess series. Those won't fail your expectations and will keep your children entertained and happy.",1266796800,,2509,4.542035398230088
3901072,2,B0002YLCHY,"My 4.5-year-old preschooler loves the Disney princesses and so when I came across this DVD [alas, before I had read the reviews], I picked it up. This is Volume Two in the Disney Princess Stories and features two actual cartoons, one featuring Princess Jasmine and the other featuring Ariel. Both cartoons have been shown on television as part of the respective series, i.e. Little mermaid series and Aladdin series. The third 'feature' is the most disappointing as it is supposedly a new feature that has Snow White in it, but is actually a cut and paste job in animation which has the characters in Snow White popping up in the feature, the main characters being Snow White and Dopey [annoyingly, all Dopey does is shake his head constantly], and the voice-over hardly even matches the animation!

It is so obvious that this DVD was made with the sole purpose of making money with no attention to quality. Fans of the original cartoons who have come to love the Princess characters deserve so much better, both young and old alike. I would strongly recommend against purchasing this inferior production.",1246579200,,1105,4.877659574468085
3901073,1,B0002YLCHY,"I agree with the other posters. This DVD was a waste of time and money. We had bought Princess Enchanted Tales with Princess Jasmine and Princess Aurora. We were really impressed with the quality of that production, so we decided to give this one a try. This video has 3 ""stories"" the first one with Princess Jasmine is really a story about Aladdin and his carpet. You barely see Jasmine and she plays almost no role in the plot. All my daughter cares about is seeing her favorite princesses, not some stupid story about a carpet. The second story is about Snow White and her pies. It is supposed to be interactive. Not at all fun, especially when we couldn't find the remote because the baby had run off with it ;). We got through a third of the Snow White ""story"" before I had to fast-forward because no one was watching it and the voice was making my skin crawl. The third story is with Ariel. It's supposed to be about her friendship with a girl Gabrielle, but Gabrielle doesn't say anything during the whole episode (which I had seen before on the Disney Channel). Besides, everyone knows Ariel's best friend is Flounder. All in all, a lousy video. Don't waste your money.",1202601600,6,1177,4.5046728971962615
3901074,1,B0002YLCHY,"this is THE most terrible kids DVD i've seen yet.  while i'll admit that my daughter likes it, that's not saying much considering she loves anything ""princess"" right now.  the Jasmine segment is just one of the crappy cartoons from the Disney channel  - that BARELY features Jasmine at all!  it's mainly about Aladin, some sprites and the magic carpet.  not at all a ""tale of friendship"".  the Snow White is unwatchable - just clips from the orig movie, dubbed over in a horrible voice.  you have to use the DVD remote to interact and if your child doesn't know how to use yours, it's pointless.  once, as the story was just beginning, i chose the option not automatically highlighted on screen and i guess that was ""wrong"" because the story ended there and moved on to the Ariel story.  which was also terrible.  another cartoon from the Disney channel series.  you can see either of these series on Disney now, w/o having to buy them on DVD.  but why would you - they've got poor animation and bad storylines.

i'm so glad i got this from the library and didn't waste a cent on it.  go the same route if your child really wants to see this.  try one of the Princess sing-alongs instead.",1200268800,2,1188,4.46046511627907

3901076,1,B0002YLCHY,"I purchased this dvd at the store because I thought my daughter would like it.

What a horrific pile of crap this video is! Not only is the mouthing wrong (how could Disney get this wrong?!) but some parts, like the Ariel portion, are blurry-ish.

The voices are pretty annoying and the worst of all is Snow White. I had no idea it would be 'interactive'.

3901078,1,B0002YLCHY,I do not have volumes 1 and 3 of the Disney Princess movies and I do not plan to buy them now that I've seen volume 2.  The Snow White segment was the absolute worst.  The so-called story line is very lame and the film makers simply stole scenes from the original movie and dubbed over them.
