8295499,5,B001DYRGYK,"This video helped me alot. I am not a pitcher and was having trouble helping my son and players with pitching mechanics. Bought this video to help me understand more about the craft and how to look for and fix problems with pitching. It was very easy to understand and not too technical. This is usually a problem with most DVD's for pitching. Not this one, it is a huge help for me. Almost makes me sound like I know what I am talking about out there!",1348617600,,452,4.206896551724138
