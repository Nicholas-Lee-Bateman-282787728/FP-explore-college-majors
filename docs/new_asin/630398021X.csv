747810,5,630398021X,"My favorite film of all time, Strange Days manages to capture everything  possible in a 2-something hour movie.  It is an action movie done with  taste.  Like other James Cameron movies, this one has is a very touchy,  emotional story told in front of a backdrop of near-anarchistic streets of  Los Angeles on December 31, 1999.  The movie has a very dark -Nautral Born  Killers- feeling but I could only be saying that because of Juliete Lewis  who plays lead roles in both movies.  The bottom line is that every person  should see this movie and eveyr person will find something to like in it.  It has beautiful romantic scenes as well as violent rape scenes, it has  everything, yet it does not feel cluttered  END",905558400,,717,4.587301587301587
747811,5,630398021X,"I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who loved this movie, I own it and I  own very few movies (I can count them on one hand).  Went to see it on  opening night in October of 96 and the theater was half empty.  The critics  hated it I believe it is because it appeals to a fairly narrow audience.  The premise is quite intriguing and the actors are very well cast. This is  a unique movie, it is hard to compare to others so that the new viewer can  determine if they would like it. Some scenes are  disturbing without being  gory (one murder scene in particular). This is definitely not a movie for  the under 16 crowd, but if you like 'thinking man's' sci-fi such as  Gattaca, some James Cameron movies (Terminator, Aliens, but EXCLUDING  Titanic) and other cult favorites like Point Break (also directed by  Katherine Bigelow), The Crow, The Doors, even the first Predator movie, you  may like this. The soundtrack is also particularly good for those who have  widely varying tastes. It has alternative, gangsta rap, even new age  flavors.  END",904348800,,1047,4.4787234042553195
747812,4,630398021X,"""Strange Days"" is a fast-paced thriller that got very little recognition from the critics.  Perhaps that's because, although full of action, it doesn't have enough gore or car ripper scenes to please thriller movie seekers.  Except for the occasional nudity, and frequent hard language, this movie may have been better off being released as a television movie.  All the same, the video is a good one to pick up for home viewing, especially after the kids are tucked away in bed for the night.  Ralph Fiennes, generally known for his dark, moody roles, pulls off the character of Lenny to the point of charming.  Angela Bassett is buff and tuff and wonderfully suited for her role as Mace. I had a bit of a problem with Juliette Lewis in the role of Faith, although I can't put my thumb on the reason why.  The rest of the cast were well suited for their roles.  Although dark and sometimes depressing, ""Strange Days"" is still worth settling down with a soda and bowl of buttered popcorn.  Don't let the widescreen format scare you away; it's amazing how fast you get used to it.  END",880675200,,1083,4.598958333333333

747905,5,630398021X,"The films that Kathryn Bigelow did in the 80s and early 90s were incredible. Near Dark, Blue Steel, Point Break and Strange Days all showed a unique style that she had for directing movies especially the action scenes. Strange Days is a highly creative, intelligent, thrilling and visually stunning Sci fi thriller that is extremely underrated. The entire cast all give excellent performances especially Ralph Fiennes and the great Tom Sizemore (who has one of the best film catalogs of any actor). This was also when the highly sexy and talented Juliette Lewis was at the peak of her incredible career as well.

It is a non-anamorphic wide-screen print (letterboxed), and with my Samsung TV and the HDMI hookup I could not get it to fill out the screen. If I used a standard component hookup the menu on my set would allow for proper sizing, but my particular set will not allow this screen-shape mode to be used with the HDMI hookup.

748241,4,630398021X,"It was made soon after the LA riots and must have been a tough decision for theaters to give it screen time. At the end of the movie it portrays the crowd attacking and brutally beating police officers that could have been explosive at the time. The attack in the movie was triggered after a replica of the Rodney King beating of Bassetts character. The story line was about the murder of a prostitute and how and why it happened. The story leaves us thinking that it was rouge cops that did it to cover up a racially provoked murder they committed. Im not sure if  I would have watched it when it came out but now 20 years after the fact things have simmered down a bit I find it very thought provoking and worth watching. The story has some good human elements in it. It has unrequited love that I personally related to and the human will to do right thing in the name of love even if it cost us our life. Bassetts character blew me away. I wish I had women like that. I wish Hollywood would give us more strong black female characters like hers. She was strong, gentle, smart and caring. Far from the MBW image we see on talk shows and news media of today. Oh and beautiful!
Great Film! It was made in the mid-nineties and I only watched it by accident but Im glad I found it. The music, action and the title held my attention long enough to build my interest of the story. I thought it was going to be another busy pointless sci-fi film at first but the human element and emotional story behind it helped keep my interest for the full two and a half hours. I am studying film and cinematography in college now and am surprised that we haven't talked about it in class. It uses so many of the techniques that we are learning about now. It reminds me of Stones Natural Born Kills and it uses many of the same techniques, slow-mo, canting, multiple lighting effects, handheld shots but without going too far with them such as Stone did with his film that left me nauseous ... Someone else mentioned that it could become another cult classic, I believe it is worthy of it. And also it does have that late 80s and early 90s feel to it. Im not sure but I get that feel from it. I really surprised that Ive never heard of it before. Maybe not a master peace but I recommend watching it.",1425340800,,2283,4.248275862068965

748246,1,630398021X,"Let me preface this by saying I am a big fan of dark sci-fi, and not at all squeamish about violence. My problem with this film is very simple. It is just very bad movie, at every level. It does not even remotely belong in the same category as dark dystopian sci-fi like Minority Report, Bladerunner, Dark City, A Scanner Darkly, Videodrome or other provocative classics of speculative fiction. Nor does it stand on it own, or break new ground thematically, or at the basic ploit/story level make any sense. (even the middling 1983 film Brainstorm covered the virtual-reality headset beat with greater depth and clarity. Like the fake Rolexes trafficked by its protaganist (given the painfully faux-noir name Lenny Nero), resemblances are superficial at best. The script is leaden with clichs and stale dialogue, leaving some talented actors nothing to work with, not even the ironic self-parody of good Schwartenegger film. At moments I felt like Ralph Fiennes was monotoning his lines in protest. The production design, inexplicably touted by some reviewers, is basically a mashup between a interminable industrial rave and a Watts riot. Even the costumes seem to attempt some sense of near-futuristic style but lack any semblance of inventiveness. It looks like a student film shot in one night at Webster Hall. The ending sequence is something that belongs in a low-grade zombie movie and by the final credits the only thought provoked by this travesty of movie-making is thank heaven thats over!",1422057600,,1500,5.076923076923077

My friend recommended I watch this and I am so glad that I listened to him. Strange Days, I remember, is both a 1995 film and a song by the Doors, but the film explains a truly possible dystopian future, and it's no fantasy! In some ways, it reminds me of the Hunger Games, in some ways it reminds me of Memento, in some ways it reminds me of the Dark Knight, and in some ways it reminds me of Taxi Driver. Hunger Games and Strange Days both share the concept of a dystopian society with police/squads and the rest of the people in the society. In Memento, Leonard uses all sorts of clues for his apparent amnesia to help him discover the murderer of his wife; in Strange Days, there is the same sort of thing going on. The Dark Knight is a long-ass movie but it has attention-grabbing action scenes and much violence...

In Strange Days, there is all kinds of chaos and mystery and confusion going on...with all sorts of twists and turns and...and, my mind is just... BLOWN!!

I would definitely recommend this movie for people who want to blow their minds out of their heads in confusion and mystery. And Strange Days is a damn long movie, so it is best to watch when there's lots of free time! And this movie is rated R, so this is NOT for kids. I am 15 years old and I don't mind R-rated movies.

748361,5,630398021X,"Nine Things About the Movie Strange Days [USA, 1995]

1. This movie was a flop in theaters, but is one of the most underappreciated movies of the 1990s. I almost never use the phrase ahead of its time, but this movie was ahead of its time.

2. Its an alternative-history science-fiction thriller set on the last two days of the year 1999. Police technology developed a new version of wiring up informants, but was leaked into the social underground. It allows the wearer to record events exactly as the brain perceives it. Then the recordings are sold to people who experience it exactly like they were there, in the persons body. Of course, the illicit technology is used mostly to record violence and sex.

3. Ralph Fiennes (you know, you know, the guy from Schindlers List? OK fine, he also played Voldemort in the Harry Potter series) plays a sleazy dealer that buys and sells these ""experiences"" like the best drug dealer you can think of. Although he tries to stay away from recordings of death (called black jacks), he ends up in possession of a recording of a brutal rape and murder that has implications on a larger societal level.

4. The movie was made by an amazing group of people in the 1990s. Not only is Ralph Fiennes in it, but Angela Bassett and Juliette Lewis are too (Lewis was in Natural Born Killers, From Dusk to Dawn, and Whats Eating Gilbert Grape). This was the first role that Bassett had where she played a woman that actually kicks ass, and not someone recovering from being a victim (like her most famous performance as Tina Turner in Whats Love Got To Do With It).

5. The movie was written by James Cameron. Yes, James Cameron. It was directed by the amazingly talented Kathryn Bigelow, who later went on to direct The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty. She was the first woman to win the Saturn Award for Best Director for this movie (The Saturn Awards are like the Academy Awards, but just for science fiction, fantasy, and horror movies).

6. The movie depicts one of the most psychologically devastating scenes against women Ive ever seen. It upset a lot of people. The fact that the movie was directed by a woman and has several strong female characters make it all the more interesting.

7. Most people didn't know what to do with this movie at the time. It was long and weird. It was a restless, cyberpunk, dystopian future/present that had its thumb on social issues ranging from drugs to racism to entertainment to police brutality. It was a mirror of American society in the late 1990s, and predicted some of the things we are seeing today, 20 years later.

8. You know the 1999 EDM hit by Fatboy Slim called Right Here, Right Now? The main lyric was sampled from this movie. Its Angela Bassetts voice.

9. This movie is as fresh, if not fresher, than when it was made. Its relevant, interesting, and creative. I hope someday it gets the recognition it deserves.",1405209600,4,2903,4.588803088803089

[originally posted 7Mar2001]

Bigelow, who bought centuries off her and her descendents' time in purgatory by crafting the almost-perfect film Near Dark, celebrated that film's tenth anniversary by teaming up with James ""my ego is Titanic"" Cameron for what, on the surface, looks like a Millennium Tension-gimmick one-off. It's too bad Bigelow, who's known for bucking trends, allowed herself to get sucked into working a gimmick film. Bigelow's directorial skills and Cameron's writing skills could have easily turned this into another Near Dark, but their need for a quick fix shot them in the foot. If you can look past the silliness of the New Year's Eve 1999 hysteria, however, there's a lot to like here.

The story centers on Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes), a former vice cop who now deals in small 3"" CD-lookin' things capable of storing and playing back physical experiences. An anonymous contributor starts sending him discs of the contributor's murders with an especially sick twist; the murderer straps the victim into the same recorder, thus allowing the victim and the murderer to feel each other's emotions as the deed takes place. Now that's a mindbender.

Between that and Nero's obsessive playing of his own tapes from a failed relationship, one assumes that the film is going to take the usual hysterical ""machines out of control"" approach, but Cameron pulls his fat out of the fire on a fairly regular basis by allowing that the technology does have its good uses, something rare in technothrillers. Add an exceptionally high-caliber supporting cast (Tom Sizemore, Juliette Lewis, Vincent D'Onofrio, the everpresent William Fichtner, a surprisingly fine turn from Angela Bassett as the female lead... you get the idea) and the whole thing comes together like biscuits and pork gravy. It doesn't have the harried, claustrophobic feeling that made Near Dark such a fabulous thrill ride, but it's certainly another Bigelow film that stands up to repeated viewings.

Extra special mention should be made here of Glenn Plummer, who's starting to match William Fichtner in ""number of minor roles this guy pops up in in great films."" Plummer is the guy all the action centers around, an angry young rapper found dead just before the beginning of the film, shot execution-style. He has a minimal amount of total screen time here, and his character is decidedly unlikable, but he's hypnotic every time he's on the screen. Keep his name in mind, if you don't already know it; if there's any justice in this world, someone will put all the pieces from this, Trespass, Menace II Society, Colors, and a handful of other excellent minor parts this guy's done together and get him into headlining roles ASAP. ****",1386201600,,2751,5.066225165562914

The plot?  Lenny gets a second chance -- or, rather, gets to find out if a ""second chance"" is a risk worth taking.  His one solid ally (played by Angela Bassett) dates from his early days, when virtue was easier to achieve -- but she, nonetheless, has bills to pay, and a non-endless supply of goodwill to furnish Lenny, if his criminal(-ized) enterprise threatens to topple her from the Straight World.

FUNNY SIDENOTE: When I sat this at 5th Avenue Cinema here in Portland, the projector wasn't working, so they had to show it on Blu-Ray -- a screening that halted in mid-procession and wouldn't have gone on if I, personally, (as it happens) hadn't recommended restarting something-or-other in the disc which was showing the movie about disc-movies ... HERE'S a ""narrative breakdown"" for ya!  How apt!",1385683200,,9165,7.162645218945487
748460,4,630398021X,"Love this movie.  Acting very good, very suspenseful, and gets a bit intense.  Was ahead of its time.  The device they use in the movie is now the Google eyewear.",1384992000,,162,4.333333333333333
748461,3,630398021X,"This was a very ambitious film that cost 40+ million dollars, but only recouped something like one sixth of that. You will see many familiar faces, something like an ensemble cast. The set design seems quite elaborate, and I am sure they studied Bladerunner extensively for not just the set design, but to a lesser degree perhaps even the plot. In some ways, James Cameron's story is in fact even more complex than Bladerunner.

So, why is this movie corny as hell? Well, it's hard to say exactly. It is deserving of cult status for the most part, and I would have really liked it for it's campy dated appeal, had there not been one (almost two) horrific rape scene. There have been many much worse rape scenes in other movies before, but not many I sat through. In fact, I wish there was a warning on any movie containing rape; had there been in this case, then I would have certainly avoided this movie.

Otherwise, this is a perfectly decent schlocky and unintentionally tongue-in-cheek type of film with many hilariously outdated references to the year 2000 being the end of the world, $3 gas prices being the beginning of the end, and Minidiscs being the preferred medium of the not-so-distant future. You can tell that the director was excited about the project, surely thinking it would fall somewhere between Die Hard (IE: the balcony scene) and Bladerunner, when in fact, it reads on the screen more like Robocop 3, with absurd costumes, characters, and peculiar film dialogue cliches thrown around right and left.

Had the rape scene never happened, it's likely I would recommend this to friends as one of those awesomely bad films you just have to see, but as it stands, it's just a touch too sadistic in a scene or two, that make the camp harder to laugh at and enjoy. I loved the horribly designed and acted ""rapper,"" and Bassett's very En Vogue 90's hairstyle...it makes 5th Element look like one of the great wonders of the world, by comparison.

""Is this movie any good though?"" I don't know, could you handle a particularly sadistic rape scene in the middle of Johnny Mnemonic or Bladerunner? You probably could, but I think we can all agree that those films were better without that. I have to suspect that, while this event is pivotal to the film's plot, it also may have been the barrier that prevented it from coming anywhere close to making it's money back. Too bad, after all the success Kathryn Bigelow had with Point Break before this, and several successful ones after this, this film at least had cult classic potential.

748502,4,630398021X,"Before she won the Academy Award for best director, Kathryn Bigelow did all sorts of movies -- war movies, vampire movies, cop thrillers, dramas.

But one of the more unusual movies she directed was ""Strange Days,"" a cyberpunk murder-mystery set in the violent futuristic world of... 1999. Okay, the depiction of the turn of the millennium is a little distracting, but not enough to keep this from being a vivid, sometimes horrifying little thriller, with astonishingly good performances by Angela Bassett and Ralph Fiennes.

In the not-too-distant past (sorry, I'll stop doing that), a new form of entertainment has come up: the SQUID, an illegal device which can record and play back memories. So a person can become anybody they want, doing anything they want -- sex, robbery, anything.

Former cop Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) specializes in recording and selling bootleg SQUID recordings, when he isn't pining after his rocker ex-girlfriend Faith (Juliette Lewis). But then a call girl who works for him is brutally raped and murdered -- and Lenny is given the ""blackjack"" (snuff) SQUID disc from the murderer's perspective. He can't take the evidence to the cops, because he knows that they will assume he's the killer.

So he enlists his friend Mace (Angela Bassett) and private eye buddy Max (Tom Sizemore) to help him track down the murderer -- whom he suspects to be Faith's new boyfriend, a record mogul named Philo (Michael Wincott). But as the bodies continue to pile up, Lenny discovers that the murders are tied to a famous rapper's recent death, and if the truth is revealed, it could unleash chaos on L.A...

Yes, I found it a bit distracting that ""Strange Days"" takes place in the final few days of 1999, since the actual turn of the millennium was much duller than Kathryn Bigelow's version. Here's it's a festering sea of violence and social unrest, splattered with virtual pleasures, lurid colors and jagged rock'n'roll -- which gives it a distinct style that is still rooted in 90s aesthetics.

The heart of the movie is a murder mystery, and Bigelow does an excellent job winding up a complex story that happens to rely on sci-fi technology. The biggest problem is that the first part of the movie really drags, mostly focusing on Lenny peddling his SQUID wares and reliving old memories. The story only really gets moving when Iris dies.

But once it does get moving, it's excellent -- fast-paced and tightly-wound, with the occasional quiet moment to let the characters blossom. And Bigelow uses the SQUID POV shots brilliantly, letting us see the brutality and horror as if we were actually living it.

Lenny a character we shouldn't really like. He's an ex-cop who has now basically become a drug dealer, and is still pathetically pining after his ex. But there's something just so boyish and charming about Fiennes that you end up rooting for him. And he has electric chemistry with Bassett, who plays a strong, capable woman who secretly loves him despite herself... and looks totally believable when she kicks butt in a spangly dress. Not many women in Hollywood can do that.

However, Juliette Lewis is so annoying that she will make you want to rip off your own ears. I know she's supposed to be a skanky, nutty rock chick in the vein of Courtney Love, but she is just insufferable. Why is Lenny so obsessed with her?!

""Strange Days"" takes a long time to rev up, but its cyberpunk whodunnit is well worth the watch -- as is Bigelow's outstanding direction. Party like it's 1999!",1365379200,,3509,4.843071786310517

The Y2K angst seems today a little funny, but back then in 1995 it surely had quite an impact on the audience, still the film holds up pretty well today (especially the social commentary about black and white is unfortunately still relevant to this day) and it was nice to visit a film from my youth (okay I was 23 back then) and a lot of the cast was not so well known like the guys(and girls) are today.

Nero's world is soon to be turned upside when on the eve of the millennium, he receives a tape which contains the murder of someone he knows. Many people don't know this, but Strange Days was actually written by famed Director, James Cameron, shortly before he did Titanic, a stark contrast from one project to the other. The mystery of Strange Days, as well as the machine, are cool as hell. What's not is how it ended, because once you find out who and why, you can pretty much figure out the rest, making the last half hour of the film unnecessary. Fiennes is the star and does a pretty good job, but the one who really impressed me was Angela Bassett. She plays his bad ass partner, Mace, and she was really something to see. Strange days is something different in many ways, but it's also predictable, repetitive, and anti-climactic in others.

Added to the mix is ethically questionable technology that allows people to experience other people's memories, and a psychopath who rapes and kills women and records the murders on snuff videos. You can probably tell the plot careens into many directions. This might have worked smoothly had the screenwriter not been James Cameron (Titanic, Avatar). Still, it's a worthwhile movie. Its socially conscious messages aren't perfect, but few movies even tackle this territory. The acting is at many points laughable. Angela Basset is the best in the cast.

748509,4,630398021X,I really enjoyed this movie when I first saw it and after watching it again I see why. This is a very cool movie with a great cast and insane plot that was unheard of at the time. This was a peek into the future from back in the 1990's. The story revolves around the millennium party happening on New Year's eve in 1999. Plenty of action and shoot outs along with a deranged serial killer. This is a film that explores the scenery and characters from very odd and interesting perspective visually. Some of the things we see in this movie have actually come to fruition. Creepy! Fun movie to check out and I recommend this specifically for Blade Runner fans.,1322611200,,657,4.39344262295082

I know your forthcoming movie about the hunting of bin laden is sure to be provoking. STRANGEDAYS really blew my mind like one the characters literally does to himself. this is a dazzling but uneasy mixture of futuristic action and social relevance capturing the addictive thrill of virtual reality. had this film come out today i think it would surely be a hit. the short but exciting car chase scene is thunderous. The last 20 minutes of this film is truly epic in downtown L.A. ralph fiennes has never been better in his grungy long haired sexy look. and talk about smoking, sexy, crazy hot, angela bassett, she was born to play ""mace"", a decent woman just trying to survive and raise her kid in a crazy world. she works hard, She fights hard, and drives hard! cameron is known for making his heroins in his films strong and brave. Sigourney weaver and jeanette goldstein in ALIENS, linda hamilton in TERMINATOR 2,and mary elizabeth mastrantonio in THE ABYSS. he once said in an interview that his mother was a strong woman which is why he made woman strong, smart, and kick ass in those films. i cant say enough about this film except wheres the friggin' bluray!? 20th century fox CMON GUYS! give us want we want instead you give us BABYS DAY OFF!!!. commentary, featurettes, DTS 5.1 HD master audio, and anything else PLEASE. until then i'll enjoy my dvd copy. pick this up here on amazon, sit back and JUST HIT PLAYBACK!!!",1319068800,2,2314,4.618932038834951

The cyberpunk technology featured herein is becoming more and more plausible by the day.  Therefore, the types of market forces and criminal actions detailed in the film shall come in tandem with it.  An important subject for our society to take note of.
This film is not not without its problems.  The plot tends to meander, the focus on the dark side of human nature is rather unrelenting, and aspects of the ending are downright hokey.  Also, much of it is rooted in the Rodney King riots of 1992 in Los Angeles, seriously dating the narrative.  Balancing that out is the intriguing premise, the performance of Michael Wincott...a fine and menacing actor who was everywhere in the 90s and has sadly not appeared much since, and the neat allusions to the Gen-X, ""slacker"" worldview that is somewhat akin to Fight Club.  Not nearly in the same category as that latter film, but strains of similar undertones.
I kept wondering, why didn't I like this more back in the day?  After all, I didn't think I could have had a bleaker view of humanity than I did fifteen years ago, but I suppose I do.  And that is why I find Strange Days all the more realistic.",1300924800,,1255,4.488986784140969

748560,5,630398021X,"Kathryn Bigalow is fun to watch - I'm glad she defined her own voice more distinctly in The Hurt Locker, but Strange Days is a great example of what James Cameron's style looks like when it's combined with someone else. It's got Cameron written all over it: a strong female lead, inventive action sequences, the threat of technology, the redemptive power of love - everything except his increasingly first-draft dialog, actually.

The story is set in the future (2000) where memories are recorded and shared illegally - people are hooked on experiencing each other's lives, with some of the less kosher experiences being traded like drugs. The film opens with a 5-6 minute point-of-view sequence (cleverly designed to look like one shot) of a robbery than ends in the death of the person recording the experience, so it provides the thrill of the hold-up with an element of snuff. It's a highly effective way to introduce the topic. The story revolves around a rape/murder that is captured as a clip, and trying to identify the killer amidst an environment of corrupt cop, a Los Angeles torn apart by riots and racism, and our hero (Ralph Fiennes) trying to move on with his life and quit his addiction to clips.

I lived in the UK when I saw this in 1995 and what prevented the movie from being a blockbuster hit was the rape sequence. It's actually essential to the telling of the story but wow did audiences run away in droves. By today's standards, where we have Robocop airing on cable at 9am, it's not *that* shocking which is more of a reflection of our desensitization than anything else. But nevertheless it derailed the movie back then and I remember people walking out of the theater at the time.

In the history of film, it will stand as a great example - maybe the only example - of James Cameron collaborating fully with someone else. It's clearly a production of two people and is much stronger than if either had created it individually. The subplots are more complicated than some of Cameron's other films and the cinematography and action are better than many of Bigelow's movies. There are some great performances from Angela Bassett and Ralph Fiennes - and Tom Sizemore, Vincent d'Onofrio and Michael Wincott are good value as ever.",1284249600,9,2252,4.754475703324808
748561,2,630398021X,"if you step back from the analysis and just get a feel for a movie, you can tell the good from the bad. this ain't one of the good.
the ideas in this movie are anything but new. william gibson wrote neuromancer in 1983 ~ comfortably before this flick.

the movie lacks a consistent feel that keeps you attached. i have very broad interests in sci-fi and found this one just too unbelievable. i have a deep appreciation for directors that feel that explicit violence and sex are *not* necessarily required. the directors of this movie have no such inhibitions: they felt that this movie could not be made without it. however, neither the violence nor the sex had much to do with the core of the plot. see blade runner for the exact opposite approach: not all possible opportunities for violence are shown. not all sex is revealed.

and here is my case in point: the most violent scenes in the movie all get the same reaction from all characters in the movie. utter horror and revulsion. and explicit condemnation of the perpetrator. why should i feel any different? the directors and actors involved in the scene deserve our revulsion.

and a completely down and out cop who repeatedly shows his inability to defend himself, finally takes out an ex football player in one stroke and holds his own in an all-out fight with a body-guard type. no kidding? and the non-violent mother of one trying to make something of her life *takes*out* two foaming-at-the-mouth bully cops. huh.

again: blade runner has it right: the ex cop is kind of mediocre at hand-to-hand fighting thru the entire movie and resorts to a gun to kill when he can. the non-violent 'woman' makes one shot with a gun and nothing else (even tho she probably could do way more).

i reject this movie based on it's own depictions and lack of cohesion.",1280880000,4,1813,4.618012422360248
748562,2,630398021X,"First off, I REALLY love this movie. I wish I could do two ratings; one for the movie and one for the disc. But I can't so this is only about the disc.

My biggest dislike is that this movie was not put to disc using the anamorphic widescreen technology. Instead it was matted with the black letter box bars, essentially hard-letterboxing the picture. This wasn't of much concern to me when I originally purchased the movie because I was watching it on an SD 4:3 TV. Now that I am using a 16:9 HD TV what I get is letter box bars AND pillar box bars, essentially reducing my 32in TV to a 22in TV.

I am hoping for a blu-ray version to be released so that I can see this film in all it's intended glory.

Don't get me wrong, pillar box bars have their place when viewing 4:3 content on a 16:9 screen. But when the picture is supposed to be 16:9 or better (2.35:1, etc...) then having both pillar box bars and letter box bars together just makes me feel cheated.",1279929600,7,960,4.178378378378379

I mean literally dark, a lot of shadow and dark and had to make out what was going on all the time. Nodded off about 30 min into it.. and didn't feel like I missed a thing.

748634,5,630398021X,"Now for those who still have yet to see this movie, it has lots of grown up material. So if you aren't old enough to see naked ladies and suggestive material, please skip this. To many, it would be a disturbing film. In ways, it even disturbed me. But some of the dialogue really struck home and made a lot of sense. Too much sense.

I usually don't get the character names down pact, and this movie was no different. I remember Lenny (the main character), Mace (Angela Bassett) and Faith. But basically in a nutshell this movie was about Lenny and his lust for his old flame, Faith, who is now with someone really not worth her time. You see Lenny made a pact with Faith that'd he'd always have her back and he falls and falls for her time and time again.

Mace has Angela playing your typically strong black women who doesn't take much (....). She is Lenny's friend and will pretty much see him through thick and thin. They make a really good team.

The main premise also involves this crazy virtual reality device that lets you experience ""altered"" realities that you can't quite experience  in the real world. If you're not careful though, many bad things can happen with them.

I don't wanna give too many hints out but I think you should watch this movie if you are 17 or older. It's got a lot to offer although a bit strange sometimes.

It felt very indie to me and not very Hollywood. Maybe it's just me.

It also felt quite fresh although I had seen the movie beforehand years and years before tonight.

Strange Days is by no means perfect (the identity of the bad guy is rather predictable, and the climactic riot ties things up too neatly) but it's so consistently interesting, with the ideas to match its fine performances, intriguing vision of the future, and strong characterization.

748636,5,630398021X,"I loved this movie, if nothing else because it is one of the few times that Ralph Fiennes leaves behind the glacial, remote,untouchable persona of so many of his roles.  Yeah,he's kind of greasy at first, but by the end, his eyes are so soft,his face so emotive with love for his friend and desperation to do the right thing.

Plus, this was- at the time, the only modern movie where a beautiful White man, realizes he loves a beautiful Black woman-  a woman he respects and has always been his friend. No skanky sex shenanigans here (at least not between these two- Juliette takes care of that part!)!

There was so much hoopla about Y2K-  people really thought there would be riots, and such. I stayed home, and they had the entire police force out on 6th street in Austin, for fear of trouble! So, it fit the time as pop entertainment.

 Now, well, it's kind of tired, but Ralph is still so tender and tormented, a regular kind of screwed up guy- I watch it again, and again just to see him.",1222128000,,994,4.369565217391305

It's still relevant and a work of art today. I haven't seen anything like it since it came out in '95.

The idea of virtual reality that you can plug into by use of a SQUID, an electronic cap with electrodes to electrically stimulate and manipulate your brain. The use of floppy disks, yeah, okay, it was '95. The use of a big ole box like the old cable boxes from yore? yah. Ok. The idea of people getting sucked into spending more time with electronic devices than living real life? Right on. Then and now. Yeah, there are internet/techno junkies. Near catatonia and zoned out.

All visually appealing films, often with more than 1 superstar. Strange Days, no doubt, a title ode to The Doors song, includes many superstars. Michael Wincott is Philo, who starred in the 1991 Val Kilmer, movie about 60's rock legends ""The Doors"".

In this regard, Strange Days opened many doors of mayhem. Pandora's Box, no less. Sex, drugs, rock and roll, techno, love, good, evil, etc.

People ""just trying to survive. Making a run for it, if need be.

When Ms. Bassett got down to Earth running through the crowds reveling in NY's merriment, she kicked off her heels and got real practical, like any  woman would. While there are elements of horror and the perverted, skidrow elements too, you also see fist fighting women, and women tag-teaming for their men. So it was no surprise when Mace hitched up her glam black gown all sequins and strapless, and shoved her pistol in her thigh garter; or when she flipped off those heels and sprinted like Wilma Rudolph. She was not about to get shot in the back a la android stripper Zhora (the whore-a?) (Joanna Cassidy) in Harrison Ford's 1982&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade-Runner-The-Final-Cut-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000UD0ESA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade Runner - The Final Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>. A beautiful dead woman running and stumbling to her death, a pretty corpse replete with heels. Maybe chalk all this up to a woman director making heroic, capable, women of action. Can't imagine someone in law enforcement who couldn't at least kick off her heels and run to dodge bullets trailing her backside. (Last summer, Blade was re-released to millions of fans' delight, in major theatres so we could see it digital, big screen. The android getting shot in the back still resonates as one vicious scene, sex and violence in a slowmo death ballet.)

Characters skirt the cusp of interracial romance between actress Angela Bassett and Ralph Fiennes. You wonder about the romantic tension, but film studios being as they are, the chemistry pops just the same between 2 people so that others feel it too, whether it takes place or not. At the end, unrequited love lets go of the past memories and lives in the now.

Overlook the stereotypical 'tude/hard black woman Ms. Bassett had to play. She chills out over the course of the movie and viewers realize it's less the black woman 'tude than an under appreciated woman willing to do battle for the man she loves, and even help him win another woman if that's what it takes for his happiness. Oh, ...sacrificing women. Sign of true love when you're willing to give your all, a sign it's not love or even friendship if someone's willing to let you take a bullet, not have your back when it counts, and even throw you under the bus.

The movie drops in the historical temperament of the '90s toward what was going on and wrong with the LAPD at that time. The riots of '92 in LA and elsewhere when the Rodney King vid hit the air (imagine Youtube igniting a firestorm back then). Strange Days is set in '99, but drops in a provocative scene of citizens versus police brutality by the LAPD. It does give credit to the good men in uniform who rise beyond corruption and are willing to police their own in the name of justice. The footage of the New Year's countdown for 2000, according to the credits was likely footage from New York Times Square. There was mention of Madrid. In this supercharged scene, Vincent D'Onofrio's police character seems more like a flashback of horrific evil from his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Full-Metal-Jacket/dp/B000P0J09C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Full Metal Jacket</a>&nbsp;Days. The crowd is awe struck and nearly speechless as the monster drags his crime in partner forward, marching towards unspeakable evil. LAPD rise to the challenge. Strange Days precedes and perhaps sets the typecast for D'Onofrio's future on Law & Order. The quirky, weird guy with a heart, who maybe is on the good guy's side, but understands the demons in all, can draw it out by drawing on his own. Ever intense, check him out in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Feeling-Minnesota/dp/0780627849/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Feeling Minnesota</a>&nbsp;with ex gf Cameron Diaz and Keanu Reeves, in which he play typecast, another odd man out. But no blood, not much anyway, this time. Men in Black? A scifi flick but not so dark and dreary for Vinny.

As refined as the Harvard alum is, her street cred didn't really pop with legit authenticity, but of course therein lies the distinguishing characteristic of someone with bigger plans than the circumstances under which they've found themselves anyway.

(In looking at the imdb.com website to see who else of celeb status was in this film, discovered Dru Berrymore..not The Drew Barrymore...but turns out there's a porn star, also with an extensive body of work.)

Look for other stellar actors that appear in many subsequent films, including William Fichtner. According to imdb.com, William's an Air Force brat, so it's no wonder he appears in years to come in progressive, multiracial and patriotic pics, including Malcolm X, Crash, Pearl Harbor, Black Hawk Down, Armageddon, Virtuosity, Switchback; and action pics with other progressive stars like A. Jolie, including Go and Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Most recently, Fichtner is in The Dark Night.

Nicky Katt appears in the film. Long before ""Boston Public"", see Katt in cyber club punk blonde hair and leather pants. (MMmm)

Tom Sizemore was also like his Strange Days pal Fichtner, in Pearl Harbor and Black Hawk Down.

According to imdb.com, Ms. Bassett has 3 films in the works, including an historical film; a rap pic about the life of rap legend Notorious, B.I.G.; and a mainstream film:
  1. Toussaint (2009) (pre-production) .... Suzanne Louverture
  2. Notorious (2009) (post-production) .... Voletta Wallace
  3. Nothing But the Truth (2008) (post-production) .... Bonnie Benjamin

Ralph Fiennes has four films in the works--a biopic about a wealthy philanthropist; a film about obsession of a younger man for an older woman in post-war Germany; a military pic set in Iraq; and an historical film:

Director Kathryn Bigelow, former painter turned film director and writer by way of Columbia Film School (home to extreme talent), is the Director of the upcoming Fiennes movie The Hurt Locker. Viewers can see the visual sensability come to life on Bigelow's films. K-19 The Widowmaker (Harrison Ford); Blue Steel (J. Lee Curtis and Tom Sizemore); are among her other films.

Writer James Cameron wrote the screenplays for Terminator (film series); Rambo; True Lies; Aliens; Titanic; and The Abyss, among other films. For Strange Days, Cameron was nominated by the Acad. of SciFi, Fantasy and Horror Films of USA, for their Saturn award; Cameron has won the Saturn awards for writing, and for directing Aliens.

748639,2,630398021X,"Back in the mid 1990s there was talk about how Katherine Bigelow (ex of James Cameroon and director of popular shows like Near Dark and Point Break) was doing a new movie with state of the art POV (point of view) content that used new camera techniques to put the viewer inside someone's head. The reason for this was to film James Cameron's vision of a world where people are able to record others people's lives via a neural net interface for playback... a sort of hippy drug for the turn of the Millennium. There was a lot of hype about this film.

Unfortunately Strange Days never lived up to its expectations. The film contained a lot of music sequences (such as bands playing) with lyrics that are frankly, bad. Just listening to the rap video makes you ask why they didn't even attempt to rhyme? It was dreadful then... and it's horrible today.

Ralph Fiennes' American accent was as inept as the script's one-liners with a delivery that didn't pay off.  Jennifer Lewis did lots of nudity for what seems like the sake of nudity and quite frankly most of us would prefer her with her clothes back on. Talented actors, such as Vincent D'Onofrio cop running around chasing people, are completely wasted.

While there is an interesting twist involving the sudden appearance of a serial killer the film gets boring and overlong with action sequences and back stories that never once stir our imagination or make a hair stand on end. To top it off the coolness expected of Bigelow's production is lost somewhere between bad hairdos and bad karma. Given that James Cameron is supposed to be a major part of it, Strange Days is a horrible let down. In the end the bad guy even reveals everything. The editing during this sequence is some of the worst ever committed. Strange Days had a lot of potential with big names and a considerable budget.

This kind of reminded me of watching the 1987 film ""Wanted: Dead or Alive"". I mean there was no less than 200 spews of profanity in the first 10 minutes of the film. I was beginning to think they were getting off on swearing, and explode into a sexual ecstasy of screams and moans at the rate they were going. The film has the plot on New Year's Eve, 1999, and Los Angeles is a war zone( When wasn't it ever a war zone people?), and the drug of the day is a head piece that allows you to play back certain scenes with certain people, and it more, or less makes it a hot commodity, and everyone tries to cash in on the thing, and in the long run it causes strife, and conflict in a community that's already in a fire of decay, anger, hate, and any other negative, and critical thing you can imagine. The National Guard is out patroling the streets along with the city police, and the rogue police as well, and they can't be trusted either. One ex-cop turned dealer in the head piece is trying to help rescue a ex-girlfriend out of the clutches of a pimp/ record producer, and prevent the Millenium from going bust at the same time, and it's hard to tell who's on your side. This is what the world wants though. We have developed the theory that Fear is the beginning of enlightment, and therefore the more fearful we are then the more smart we are. We don't take time for friends, family, to enjoy life, or appreciate the beauty of the world. That's what the head piece is for we say, but guess what? The head piece also can be like a bad batch of acid which can kill you if you're not careful. Ralph Fiennes and Angela Baseheart give a convincing performance as you would see them in love with one another, and in a way they may have had the feelings repressed way down inside of one another as Fiennes when he was a cop rescued Baseheart's family especially her son, so the feelings were there, and they build during the film until thier passionate kiss at the end which to me was the highlight of the movie. The rest of it was a weak plot where excessive swearing has to give it meat, the other performances were at best lackluster, and just the fact that it shows the world as a place that I already know it is didn't make me feel any better. Not even worth a $1.00 price to watch. I wanted to watch it back when it first came out in the theaters, but now I'm glad I didn't.",1178150400,2,2538,4.129292929292929

As a true fanatic of sci-fi (Andromedia Strain, Logan's Run, Clockwork Orange, 2001, 2010, Flatliners, Gattica, etc) I have to say, ""what were they thinking?""

This film is without question one of the worst movies ever made, and other reviewers that gave this four or five stars for its cinematic prose and appreciation to fine electrifying cinematic cultism, need to get their head examined, as they as movie goers were on their own drug induced-kinetic stupor while watching it.

What i like is that the technology doesn't seem out of the realm of possibility in the near future.  It might have had the years off by a mile, but it's not a future that seems impossible in retrospect.

There are some tough scenes for viewers that are rather sensitive, but for the viewers that are willing to continue the journey, there is some very interesting movie time devoted to a future that isn't ridiculous to fathom.

The movie presents a futuristic ""drug"" that actually makes sense, and revolves a plot around a drug that makes you want to feel what it's like to be in someone elses shoes.  The twists in the movie might not surprise those that are now used to expecting twists in films, but the movie still has a way of keeping you absorbed it the atmosphere that it has created.

In my opinion, what drives me with this movie is the world that it creates, and what the characters do with it.  That makes it very interesting to me.  The circumstances combined with the world that the movie created makes it even more interesting.

This movie has it's tough moments to watch, but i admire it's courage to depict what some people would do with the technology that the movie presented.

748720,2,630398021X,"The first scene in 'Strange Days' -- choreographed within one extended shot, for at least a few minutes -- is phenomenal in execution and possessing rare grit. The rest of the film doesn't follow suit.

It's not a bad film by any means, and that's why I think it's such a boring experience; the cinematography is at times stellar, and likewise in its finer moments (of action, mostly) it can resemble the direction of James Cameron, and surely that's a huge compliment. On this minor subject, I tend to think that being Cameron wrote and produced the film, he at minimum had to have a reasonable role in ""creating"" the film -- my guess is he probably helmed certain scenes, in place of Bigelow). I say ""reasonable"", however, because the overall result is far, far lower than Cameron has ever directed, both in flair, substance and intellect. It might be more disturbing in some respects, but that doesn't necessarily make it bold or reflective.

I really think, overall, the film suffers from its exaggerated sense of self-importance, when the storyline and characters don't provide much to empathize with. Therefore, the whole thing becomes a sort of drag -- one that just so happens to take place within a time and environment that's coated with a sordid ambiance. And regarding this -- what's with the seemingly anarchistic dystopia, only ---4--- years after the film was released? It seems the only reason they chose this time frame is to capitalize on, I guess, the fundamental appeal of ""2k"", but it has little relevance to the plot, if any. The problem, though, lies in the fact that the nasty, chaotic world in 'Strange Days' is far too unrealistic to be 1999 -- in terms of technology, first off (in concept it makes sense, but here we are in almost 2007 with no such devices; I'd say about 2020 might be a little more practical an estimate). Secondly, though, and more important, is the depiction of such a nihilistic mentality filled with sleaze. As has proved with time, we don't evolve from one state to another that quickly as a collective; in the four years between 1995 and 1999, a great number of things seem to have rapidly changed for the worse.

Still, we can, in retrospect, look at a film like Ridley Scott's sci-fi classic 'Blade Runner' -- released back in 1982 and depicting a Human dystopia circa 2019 (which also happens to take place in L.A.), and though we can ponder the ideas and sentiments of the picture, we can also see, living in 2007, that his portrayal of a world 30 years from now was simply too bleak and one that will hardly match up to the Los Angeles of 2019. Compare Spielberg's contemporary take on a familiar time period (I don't remember exactly; something like 2050 I think), and we see the enormous contrast between each film's reality. This is inherently a risk of sci-fi located in the future, of course, but as 'Blade Runner' and a handful of others have proved, how much of a film's predictions matches up with the coming reality is not of absolutely essential importance, as long as it possesses depth and ideas that evoke thought on a more subtle, universal level. Not only does 'Strange Days' lack conveying these things, it seems almost asinine that they were SO obviously off target (I mean, c'mon!) in throwing this world at us and claim it's only 1999!

Another thing I found within the film is that while it's dark and often grotesque, it's also unintentionally goofy. The acting ranges from good to pretty laughable, and these are by and large solid actors; one could argue the result in that respect is due to Bigelow.

For a similar themed movie I'd recommend David Cronenberg's 'Videodrome', though one must go into that with some particular cautions. Even more akin among the two is Ralph Fiennes character to 'Videodrome's protagonist played by James Woods; in the first half hour of 'Strange Days', I literally thought he was aping, or perhaps homaging, Woods' performance given the context.

Not a dismal effort overall, and it tries. As is pretty obvious, though, I for one don't care for it.",1164758400,7,4061,4.736916548797737

If you haven't seen this movie or just curious on what the `future' (2000) may hold. Then I strongly suggest viewing this movie.

We are first introduced to a first person robbery gone, wrong, and I mean splat!

Leo played by Ralph Fiennes was at first disappointed that the `playback' ended so badly, almost ruining his day, but hey, this is Leo, peddle a person tragic, romantic, sexual `playback' is another person fantasy.

They really didn't get into much detail on his past but he was a cop gone bad now he's a hustler selling other people realities.

So what is a 'sqid'?, don't worry Leo will tell all what it is. well Leo has some problems, he is really into 'playback' especially 'playbacks' with him and Faith. Yes, Leo is still in love with Faith, (Juliette Lewis) a girl he pulled off from the street, who in turned stabbed him in the back to pursuer a music career with Leo former buyer.

Mace (Angela Bassett) is the best friend who only wants the best for Leo and can't understand why he can't let Faith go. Mace saves the day throughout the movie and she is always saving Leo rear end from a lot of sticky situations. There are some great moment when Leo realize that there is a reason for Mace preaching and once realize this act upon it.

Max P.I. (Tom Sizemore) plays Leo friend with a few secrets of his own.

Look out for Vincent D'Onofrio (Law and Order:CI) and William Fichtner (Invasion) who played police officers who gets a little trigger unhappy with the way Jericho One always had an opinion on society.

The use of the ""squid"" technology to save and transfer experiences from one human to others is a tremendous 'invention' within the context of an SF film, but it is the way that Cameron and company used it to amplify the razor's edge of technological innovation vis a vis human society (and individuals.)

The basic storyline is as follows: There exists a technology that was created by the government, which found it's way on the streets and has since been outlawed. Due to the emotional need for this new tech, it is created and sold on the underground (much like the situation with LSD in the 60's).

The technology is a device that allows the user to experience sequences that were recorded so that it is like they are really there in the scene. This is not virtual reality where you are the one moving around, you experience what was recorded exactly as it happened. The device works through sending the signal or whatever into the nuerotransmitters of the brain so all the senses are affected.

Most of the sequences are thrilling and allow people who live ordinary lives to experience certain behavior that they otherwise would never know, or people in relationships to experience sexual fantasies wherein they feel as if it is actually happening when it is not, hence they are not actually cheating. Then there are the more immoral sequences, the misuses, etc., that are the cause for the conflict in the film.

Feines is a dealer who is obsessed with his ex whom he has several sequences of which allows him to relive his past when they were together. He happens upon a sequence which is quite illegal, actually two of them, and he, along with a potential love interest (Angela Bassett), tries to find out who was responsible. What he finds out is a shocking cover-up that puts his life in danger.

Ignore the negative reviews, this movie is thrilling with a fascinating look at a riveting form of entertainment technology. It is not a straight-up sci fi flick, it is more than that. I would label it as a thriller with some sci fi aspects to it, not the reverse. The acting is well done and since it only takes place about 5 years in the future (from the time it was made), the setting does not look radically different than the present. To say it should is stupid. It is 12/31/1999, not 2050.

The best part of the film are the 'sequences', which are, of course, shot in the 1st person, and allows you to imagine what the person is feeling as he is hooked up to the device. As I mentioned, there are some disturbing scenes, including a crime involving a woman, that some people were upset over, but to ask how a woman could direct a movie that has a scene involving a crime against a female is insulting to any woman in the industry. What do you think, women should only be allowed to direct movies like Bridget Jones Diary? That is the more misogynistic view, in my opinion.

I'm no James Cameron fan, and I found the first hour or so of ""Titanic"" so pretensious that I almost couldn't get through it. So I was shocked to find how much I loved ""Strange Days."" This is a gutsy film that takes a lot of chances in terms of plot, performance and presentation -- American critics claim that's what they want in American movies and, yet, when such a film comes around, they berate it for such.

At its most basic level, ""Strange Days"" is a thriller -- futuristic film noir, with all of the traditional characters.  But don't let the title or the plot summaries fool you -- this is a film that is less about new technology, science fiction and the future, and much more about the volatility of race and police relations in the USA, laced with strong athemes of unrequited love, trust, and the darker side of massive urban cities in the USA -- all presented in a frighteningly authentic manner. This is a character-driven movie, not an effects-driven one.

This is also an ensemble piece, where even characters with just a few lines are essential to the mood and presentation, as well as giving the main actors juicy moments to play off of. Director Kathryn Bigelow maintains a frantic, claustrophobic pace in this film, never going for the obvious -- every scene has a point, big or small, which you know in the moment or that you will learn about later. The soundtrack enhances the visuals in a way rarely experienced in a modern film.

If nothing else, you will love Angela Bassett. She's amazing not  for the kung fu moves -- her character is the voice of reason, and her performance is stunningly genuine (and heart-breaking at times).

Set in a near future, the story deals with classic themes like virtual reality, thought control or the share of memory, providing and exciting and engaging cyberpunk adventure.
Director Kathryn Bigelow creates a futuristic LA that manages to be both sophisticated and believable, avoiding the over-the-top, utopic and not very realistic depictions of future societies presented in other sci-fi films.
Although ""Strange Days"" is basically a thriller, it is way above many run-of-the-mill movies of its genre, as it suceeds at combining its key elements perfectly. The direction is dynamic, unique and fast-paced, adding style and energy with an excellent sense of rythm, flow and tension.
The acting is also a plus, since Ralph Fiennes is unforgettable as the flawed anti-hero Lenny and Angela Basset shines as his sister-in-arms Mace. This duo makes for an odd, yet original and memorable couple, delivering some enticing and moving scenes. It`s also interesting seeing the female character protecting the male for a change, making for a clever reverse of the predictable and typical scenario of most action flicks. Juliette Lewis is also convincing as the dark and feral femme fatale, especially when she sings a P.J. Harvey song to perfection (one of the many excellent and remarkable moments of this movie).
""Strange Days"" is much more than a futuristic thriller, providing a rich cinematic experience that brings issues such as isolation, trust, friendship, love and life in general. Every scene is compelling and intriguing, and the plot is very well developed, culminating in a tense, dynamic and huge finale with a superb climatic ending. Kudos to the soundtrack, by the way, especially the Skunk Anansie live presence during the last scenes that adds a lot of edge, mood and atmosphere to that peculiar chase sequence.
Overall, this movie is definitely an underrated classic and a must-have. Forget overrated stuff like the boring and very flawed ""Blade Runner"", since ""Strange Days"" is a much more compelling and solid sci-fi masterpiece.

At first it was hard to care about his character, but as the movie progressed I began to empathize with him. Angela Bassett was also wonderful as Mace, his friend who becomes his love interest. It was nice to have a female lead in an action film that did not need a knight in shining armor, but actually rescues the hero. To be honest, I was more into the romance between Mace and Lenny. Their history together could have been better developed, like how Mace went from grieving single mother who waits tables to a limo driver that kicks ass on the side and how Lenny got kicked off the LAPD and became a wire head.

748848,1,630398021X,"I saw this originally in the theater in 1995, and even then I thought they did a very poor job of creating a convincing ""futuristic"" environment, although the millennium was only 4.5 years away at that time. Except for the gimmicky memory-recording-cd- headgear (stolen from a very similar but more thoughtful movie in the 80s called ""Brainstorm"", Natalie Wood's last film), there is nothing science-fictionish about this movie AT ALL...neither does it have anything interesting to say about life at the turn of the new century.
Only 8 years old now and STRANGE DAYS plays as very dated and very creaky looking AND sounding. No mention of the internet although it was very much there in 1995. Cars, music and (very bad looking and unflattering) costumes scream 1995, and make no comment or interpretation about the near future.
Ralph Fiennes -- an otherwise fine actor -- is horribly miscast. Does no one even question why a former LA cop would have a British accent? He is totally unconvincing. Juliette Lewis, also capable of good performances although her overall screen career is terrible -- so horribly annoying you just want to slap her -- there is nothing here to suggest why Lenny Nero would be so obsessed with her except that she has a hot body and looks about 17. Ms. Lewis should have sued Kathryn Bigelow or James Cameron for presenting her in such a wretching unflattering way -- the film just makes her look awful with a bright red fright wig and unbecoming clothing.
A lot of really fine actors, including Michael Wincott, Tom Sizemore, Vincent D'Onofrio, etc. are utterly and completely wasted in this dreck. Their characters are not developed in the slightest and they basically play stock stereotypes, i.e., the venal rock and roll manager, the crooked cop, etc.
Only gorgeous Angela Bassett comes out of this spelling like a rose -- she looks beautiful and plays a really tough, physical character. It's interesting to see the idea of a passive, weak male character being protected by a strong physical female protagonist, but it isn't explored in any interesting way here. You do get to see her kick some serious butt but that's all. The romance between Mace and Lenny feels tacked on, and has no erotic charge at all -- they only kiss briefly at the very end.
Horrible production values! The film is dark and not in some clever ""noir"" way but as if the director hoped she could hide the boring sets and ugly costumes this way. No interesting special effects or CGI. Violence is constant and gratuitous and adds nothing to the storyline but cheap shocks and a feeling (odd in a film directed by a WOMAN) of misogynism. The music -- a few bits of legit rock music (not much) and to pay for it, you have to listen to Juliette Lewis SING...aaarrrggghh.
Worst of all is the script, totally lame, violent, unoriginal. My first thoughts on seeing it in the theater was that there was almost nothing of science fiction here, just a cheap exploitative serial killer type of film with a gimmick (and not an original one, either), and that it has nothing to say about the millennium, which it SHOULD HAVE, being that it was filmed at the end of the 20th century. It's even more lame today considering all we have seen happen (the internet, 9-11, etc.).
Don't even bother to rent this one, let alone buy it. I am sure all the actors who particpated in this mess are sorry they did so.",1063756800,12,3394,4.696308724832215
748849,5,630398021X,"""Strange Days"" stars the incomparable Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Lewis as former lovers in a futuristic, bent-for-hell society.  Fiennes plays Lenny, whose career is selling vicarious, virtual reality experiences to people.  They experience these by putting on headsets with tapes that Lenny has culled from his underworld contacts.  Things turn even uglier when a serial killer gets turned on by making his own tapes of his murders, while they are being committed, and sends them to Lenny.  Lenny tries to rescue Lewis from the even darker underworld people she now lives with but it is an uphill battle.  This is one of my favorite Ralph Fiennes performances plus Bigelow at the top of her game.

748850,5,630398021X,"Where was I when the film ""Strange Days"" was released?  Where were you?  Do any of you remember it?

It's awesome...electrifying...superbly cast...well edited...a riveting soundtrack...and a must-see for thriller fans.

No!  This is not another review of one of my horror flicks.  This is simply a thriller...non-stop from start to finish.  It's sci-fi theme is so subtle, you really don't feel like it's unreal.

If you liked ""Natural Born Killers"", ""The Salton Sea"", ""Blow"", and other riveting classics, this one's for you.  How can you go wrong with a cast like this?

It stars Ralph Fiennes.  Ralph, who is also the Red Dragon in last year's three-quel of ""Silence of the Lambs"", smuggles SQUIDS.  What are SQUIDS?  As you know, I don't give away plots.  Let me just say that Ralph is ""the Santa Claus of the subconscious"" and peddles real-life cerebral clips (I'll leave it at that).

He's joined by Juliette Lewis, who starred in ""Natural Born Killers"" and is just as dynamic in her role as a rock star in this gem.

Add to that Angela Bassett, who is (to me) the best African-American female actress on the planet.  You will agree when you see her this time.

Not to mention Tom Sizemore, who starred as the police investigator in ""The Salton Sea"".

Then there's Michael Wincott, who starred in one of my all-time classic films, ""The Doors"".

And how about Vincent D'Onofrio, who also starred in ""The Salton Sea"", ""Men In Black"" and ""Full Metal Jacket""?

Needless to say, the film also cast Glenn Plummer as a rock hero.  Glenn also starred in ""The Salton Sea"" as the dealer with the ""crossbow""...remember?

Add to that the bizarre twists and turns that culminate with a shocking ending.  This movie never ends.  It takes you down a road map filled with lefts, rights, u-turns and rollovers.

And yes, for you guys (and gals), it is sexy.  The thread that holds the movie together is the passion of a man yearning to keep his woman...a woman wanting his man to understand ""love""...an underground populace searching for fantasy and surreal ""clips"".

This film will take you on a journey you've never experienced.  The cover of the DVD box reads...""...anything is possible.  Nothing is forbidden.""  Right on! If my review helps you decide, then don't try a rental.  Go buy it!  I guarantee you'll watch it more than once, twice, thrice.....

On a scale of 1-10 in this genre', ""Strange Days"" gets a 10.  It was a 9 until I realized how hypnotic Juliette Lewis can be.  She has a raw talent to be rough, sexy, real, passionate and spoiled...all in one breath.  Her appeal should be a standard in Hollywood these days.  She's totally believable and uncensorable.

748920,4,630398021X,"I missed Strange Days when it first came out, and I regret it.  James Cameron has almost always been a sentimental fool, and his story for this film is no exception.  However, his decision to farm it out to Kathryn Bigelow was inspired, because her films have always been wilder, more worrying and more extreme than his - with the noble exception of ""The Terminator"", the only Cameron film with the courage of its altogether ignoble convictions.
It's sort of funny watching it now, in 2001, considering that the hi-tech-driven action is supposed to take place at the end of the last century.  A lot of people have a problem with Ralph Fiennes as the hero, but I have a soft spot for old Ralphie - his whole schtick as an actor is about playing morally ambiguous characters who nevertheless have high ideals.  He honed this doing Shakespeare on stage in the UK, and perfected it with his lover/traitor figure in ""The English Patient"".  This is a test-run, as it were.  Lenny Nero is a dealer in other people's memories who, god help him, believes in the product.  His greasy hair, wheedling grin and obsession with his Armani suit are all beautifully of a piece, and his white knight complex is well-suited to his nervous charm and softly polished voice.  It's a strange, lovely performance, in my opinion, even if some of the more baroque bits of tech-explanation are no more than perfectly competent.  (Fiennes is great at the enjoyment of the memory technology, not quite so fluid at the exposition of it, but part of this is due to a more than slightly corny script.)
Tom Sizemore has a frankly alarming wig and a reliable turn in Dubious Friend, and that's all we want from him.  Richard Edson - the original drummer for Sonic Youth, trivia fans - does a nice jittery job as Fiennes' techie contact.  Angela Bassett is nothing less than splendid as Fiennes' protector, walking conscience and eventual...well, you'll have to see it, but you'll guess it pretty early on.  She has at least one great line to deliver: ""Memories are meant to fade, Lenny.  They're designed that way for a reason.""
Michael Wincott, as a sleazy rock manager to go with the gallery of other sleazy people he's spent a career bringing to the screen, and Juliette Lewis, as his protegee and Lenny's glamorously wasted Ex, are more than OK.  Vincent D'Onofrio (one of the best actors in the world) carries off the psycho cop excellently, although any number of lesser actors could have done a comparable job.
The only problem is the script, which in its determined liberalism (the LAPD isn't really rife with racism, oh no, it's just a couple of loose cannons here and there) is at odds with the basically scary premise.  In the end, it relies on the concept of The Good Cop and Real Love Conquering All.  I don't suppose it could've been any other way, but...really.
The whole thing is executed (sic) with characteristic Bigelow panache.  One nice piece of support casting is the Quebecois dancer Louise Lecavalier as one of Wincott's bodyguards - a genuinely scary presence, six feet of muscles, blond dreadlocks and an enigmatic smile.  In all, it's a gutsier film than most, but the script veers away from its own momentum, and it ends up as just another potentially incredible movie gone respectable.

What makes this film so good is it mixes film noir, action, mystery, and dark comedy together effectively. Most films that try juggling this many balls fail, but this one scores.
Also, the film never tries to be over the top. Most futuristic films get so caught up in the technology that they forget about character development. However, this films mixes social commentary with the tech stuff, keeping the film grounded.
Now for the acting - both Ralph Fiennes and Angela Bassett really nail their roles. In fact, all the actors in the film make their characters very believable",991094400,2,650,4.761061946902655

I know a few people who find this to be a really brilliant film, and while it does bring up some interesting and even controversial issues it wallows too much in its own self-importance and pretension. Ralph Fiennes is just too wooden to be believable in his role as Lenny, a ""dealer"" of some sort of futuristic virtual reality recordings. (Apparently these ""recordings""-whose name escapes me at the moment-are quite addictive and quite illegal. They are actual recordings of events from the perspective of the person wearing a device on their heads. The viewer then wears a similar device to view the recordings from the point of view of the recorder. The viewer also feels what the recorder was feeling. This makes for some rather disturbing recordings and, worse yet, viewings). Juliette Lewis turns in a skanky portrayal of Faith, the singer with whom Lenny is eternally obsessed.

(And that's when they're not stripping and standing around 90-100% nude.) Bassett's strength gives the movie some female force, but only by putting her macho boots up the noses of the bad guys and gals.

This film has  some unforgiving scenes, particularly one horrific rape scene that ends in  strangulation.  If you think of a society as a perfect mime of all bad  things that occur in films, then you might well be disgusted.
I  don't.
Many stock characterizations are used to great effect in this  film, since film-noir essentially repackages the same feeling of mystery  and danger every time.  Ralph Fiennes plays a former vice cop turned  pusher, and what he markets is the recorded memories of street life and sex  - i.e. the stuff that the middle class wants without the risk of offending  the law or their popularly held ethics.  With all down-on-their-luck  detectives, it's the personal relationships that provide the drama once  things begin to turn dark.  Angela Bassett and Juliette Lewis are the women  in his life, the former being the one who wants him in spite of himself and  the one who he wants without the faintest glimmer of love returned.
It's  an excellent mystery, and it never failed to keep me wondering about the  resolution - which is what makes mystery entertaining.  Never doubt that  you are watching a film about people who regularly perform criminal acts,  attempting to solve a mystery with which the police cannot be bothered.  It's not a pretty or conventionally moral world that this film depicts, and  the fact that it almost exists already adds to its impact  tremendously.
Restrain judgment until you can appreciate the wondrous  sleaziness and imaginative use of noir conventions.  It's suspenseful, hits  hard and ends better than the plot usually plays in reality.",958089600,6,1810,4.959866220735786

Unfortunately, Strange Days peters out in the first  act.
Take for instance the promising play with POV during the  murder--arguably the centerpiece of the film--where perception, memory,  desire, and all of those other elements that are hot in academe these days  are treated in a genuinely NEW way!  I was shocked.  Somehow it seemed to  step above the schoolboy thrill-seeker Fangoria level (I can hear it now:  ""And then he killed her, and she saw it, and HE saw it too,  man!"") to something truly abject, disturbing, X-rated.  For all of its  denial of dealing with VR, the movie trafficks in it, in my opinion, a  really novel way.
But then it slides comfortably back into the Hollywood  groove: the white and black hats firmly on the right heads and tongue NOT  in cheek.  Like The Matrix, which began as a kind of Marxist reading of AI  craziness, this film lets the plot and Cameron's hubris overshadow some  really interesting and terrifying aesthetics, leaving the rest of the film  flat and predictable.
So when the big pretentious social questions  start to get answered in the last 2 minutes, we know that eveybody is going  to end up holding hands in the streets as long as the RIGHT black hats get  singled out and shot, prompting the theater crowd to stad up and cheer,  too.

749042,5,630398021X,"Strange Days is a visually stunning movie. If you enjoyed such movies as Blade Runner and Logan's Run, you should be enthralled with Strange Days. The movie's plot is multi-layered and extremely intricate and James  Cameron's effort of weaving it into one climatic finish is simply a  masterpiece. Part of the movie's brilliance is Ralph Fiennes' character,  Lenny Nero. His complex personality and human vulnerability can't help but  make you pull for him and he does not disappoint. I enjoyed this movie so  much, I've forgotten how many times I have seen it. I own both regular and  widescreen and will buy the DVD version also. Strange Days can either be  labeled as a thriller, a mystery, science fiction or suspense and it is a  movie that should not be missed!",945302400,,767,4.801526717557252

749044,4,630398021X,"I happened upon this movie two years ago on HBO, loved it, and have watched it on a regular basis ever since. I dig the futuristic qualities about it, as 2000 is a mere 17 days away. I thought Ralph Fiennes, and  Angela Bassett were great as the leads, although my patience with Juliette  Lewis wore thin very early on.

749045,5,630398021X,"There is so much packed into this film that it would of been possible to create so many different movies from ideas put forward in this little  wonder.  Directed by the brilliant Kathryn Bigelow (Near dark/point break)  it  begins with a highly stylised and altogether mind-boggling opening  sequence (You'll be asking yourself-'how did they do that?') Then slowly  you are drawn in to a dangerous world where the new drug on the street is a  different form of reality whereby you are able to view another  persons  memories or experiences via an interesting squidgy thing that  rests on  your head.  Violence has become commonplace and EXTREME PARANOIA has set  in, on the last day of the twentieth century.  The crowd scenes near the  end are truly a vision of what might be.  Indeed the production team used  real life footage of previous new year  celebrations to enhance the reality  of those scenes.  At almost two and a half hours long it may well confuse  some people  but the intelligent  script and nice acting by the stars keeps  the viewer entertained and amazed until the nicely put together ending  credits roll.  There is a controversial virtual realistic rape scene which  may shock some viewers but do not let this hinder you from letting the film  draw you in to it's vision.  James Cameron has said that STRANGE DAYS was  the most interesting film he had worked on. Great Movie.  Works on all  levels.",944784000,,1420,4.739669421487603
749046,3,630398021X,"This film was way too dark for my tastes (literally and figuratively), and it was a waste of a perfectly good cast.  And there is one more thing that is bothering me.  Is is just me, or does Michael Wincott (the guy who plays  Juliet Lewis' boyfriend) always seem to be the bad guy in every other film  I see? I can name at least 5 other films I've seen him in where he is a  villain. Also, I am sick and tired of the future being portrayed as dark  and depressing.  Can't we have at least one movie that is semi-optimistic?  Overall, weird film,I couldn't imagine owning it.",944524800,,575,4.2110091743119265
749047,5,630398021X,"Despite what a lot of critics have said about it, Strange Days ranks as one of my favorite films, simply for the immersive, anarchistic feel and the brief glimpse of what our future could look like.  It perhaps might be  more of a cult film than could be enjoyed by the mainstream audience, but  if you're looking for an involving, gritty, not-so-futuristic action flick,  check this out.  Ralph Fiennes convinces, though Juliette Lewis could've  been better.  Tom Sizemore, however, is my quiet favorite in his role as  Lenny's (Fiennes) pal.  There's enough action to keep the plot interesting,  and it's always fun the first time around to decide who's doing what.",943056000,21,667,4.927927927927928

It is an excellent transfer but is not reallly much better than the VHS widescreen version (I have them both so I did some  systematic comparisons). In fact, the VHS version has an excellent  ""behind the ecenes"" segment at the end showing how the film was  staged which is not on the DVD. The DVD has a director's commentary, but  only for a portion of the film. So, I would say the DVD is disappointing.",938822400,,495,4.23404255319149
749069,5,630398021X,"My second favourite film ever.
For me this movie is all about the redemption of Lenny Nero.  I can relate to his fall from grace, his subsequent attempt to lose himself in the dark world he deals with and then  his final redemption with Mace.  The final moments of film from the  shooting of the second corrupt police officer onwards never fails to  genuinely move me, with the slow-mo and the soundtrack being used to  admirable effect.  The final explination of Jeriko One's demise. via the  elusive clip, was genuinely shocking to me.  Very well done.
The  unveiling of the main criminal in the film's finale was well done.  I DID  NOT see it coming, and I must admit to hating reviewers who harp on about  being able to see major plot twists from a mile away.  Maybe I'm just dumb,  but I rarely see them.
The visuals of LA on the brink of implosion were  fascinating to me.  I will find out the truth as I have booked my flights  and accommodation and will be there for New Year.  I'll post an update if I  survive!
Mace was a well written strong female character and was a  perfect role for Basset.  I would not like to go up against that  lady......
My only quibble with the film is Juliette Lewis.  I confess that I  have hated all the characters in all the films she has ever done, but Faith  takes the biscuit.  I am sure that the character was SUPPOSED to be whiney,  narcissistic and annoying and she really turns in a performance which  fulfills that to the hilt.
Also, as previous postings have said, the  Peter Gabriel/Deep Forrest track over the closing credits is worth buying  the soundtrack for.  I did!  What hasn't been mentioned is the use of the  black and white stills at the beginning of the end credits.  I think they  are striking and their use is perfect.  Does anyone know where I can get  hold of good quality versions, either printed or electronic?",934848000,2,1879,4.433628318584071
749070,5,630398021X,"Strange Days is an excellent example of using film to tell a story given the high-caliber actors (Ralph Fiennes, Angela Bassett, Tom Sizemore and Juliette Lewis) and the realistic/futuristic production design (LA 1999).  Everyone I've recommended this movie to has enjoyed it!  The story of a  lovesick ex-cop, turned virtual-reality junkie and civil rights advocate is  a delightful ""what if"" scenario.  Also, I'm not surprised that  James Cameron's production company is involved, I'd have to say that he is  the ""King of the ""What If"" scenario!""  (For instance,  ""What if"" In order to change the future, a robot is sent back in  time to kill a specific person.(The Terminator)) It is unfortunate that  this movie wasn't promoted more and I feel lucky that I came upon this  movie accidently on HBO.  Although I am a fan of thrillers and sci-fi, a  good story (giving the viewer a range of feelings and emotions) regardless  of the genre is what truly sells to a wide audience.  I believe that  Strange Days is a good story told extremely well by the director, Kate  Bigelow, using film.",929577600,9,1089,4.85792349726776
749071,5,630398021X,"Although directed by Kathryn Bigelow, this movie was written by James Cameron and produced with Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment.  As a result, Strange Days feels as though it was Cameron himself calling the shots  behind the camera-lens.  Lenny Nero (an incredible performance by Ralph  Fiennes) is an ex-cop, kicked out of the LAPD, and now hustling 'clips,'  recorded events of other peoples' lives, on the black market.  When a  'wearer' (watch the movie, and you'll understand) of Nero, Iris, turns up  crying and tells him she's being chased, the main story begins, and from  there, it's a two-hour roller coaster ride of incredible drama, exceptional  dialogue, and action sequences I've never seen before.  From the intense  singing of co-star Juliette Lewis to the final scene, this movie will leave  even the most hardened movie watcher guessing!  And if I've persuaded you  enough, I urge you to try out the widescreen version of the movie, because  standard format cuts out many important details; plus the THX sound is a  great improvement in sound.",928368000,,1064,5.128654970760234

7857773,4,630398021X,"Ms. Bigelow skimped on nothing an action film needs and steered clear of clich&eacute; -- shaky-cam, where they fake tension by pretending they can't hold the camera still; improbable stunts; dumb zingers; macho preening -- but the film failed to find an audience, due to poor marketing, vague and uninspired title, plot not lending itself to simple catchy formula, sleazy put-upon protagonist not played by conventional action star, and a conspiracy that turns out less than meets the eye, and the flaw of specific saying to New Years Eve 1999; none of these being normal traits of a James Cameron project.

But it DOES have Ralph Fiennes' loosest, most relaxed performance; Angela Bassett's very persuasive kick-ass/reluctant-motherly chauffeur/bodyguard; Tom Sizemore's least irritating performance; a brisk pace set off by a chaotic, still-spectacular, groundbreaking single-take POV opener on an invasion crew racing up stairs and across rooftops; huge setpiece nightclub and streetlife crowds more realistic than usual for Hollywood; decent music and dialogue.
