6867989,5,B00QHM4DI0,"This was VERY well done!  I'm a huge Little House fan.  However, as a violinist, I have to mention that the bridge on the violin was placed a couple inches too close to the fingerboard.  As is, the violin would not be playable.  This could be adjusted in a minute or less.  Question:  Is Mr. Ingall's violin in a museum?",1427068800,2,320,4.25

6868019,5,B00QHM4DI0,"This documentary does not journey through Laura's entire life. While Laura's early life and marriage to Almanzo are mentioned, they only serve to sharpen the focus of the documentary, which remains strongly on Wilder's writing career: how the loss of her family, along with the concern that the pioneering era was slipping away, inspired her to put pen to paper; how farm life inspired her journalism work for the Missouri Ruralist; how the sometimes tense relationship with her daughter, Rose, shaped her writing, and how through that experience Wilder grew as a writer; the creation of the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, and the series' continued popularity with young readers.

Historical photographs, book excerpts, reenactments, and expert insights give viewers a glimpse into the life of one of America's most beloved writers. While many of the photographs are ones Wilder aficionados have seen before, they have been used in new ways to bring a special touch to Laura's story. The artwork of illustrator Cheryl Harness captures the essence of Wilder's Little House series and brings this legacy to life through animation. Discussions with Laura Ingalls Wilder biographer, John E. Miller, and Pamela Smith Hill, editor of Laura Ingalls Wilders Pioneer Girl: The Annotated Autobiography, add depth to this engaging story covering Wilder's legacy.

Bonus features include topics on Native Americans and African Americans on the prairie, the beautiful work of American artist Harvey Dunn, and the Morgan Horse. Viewers are encouraged to travel behind the scenes with director Dean Butler as he chronicles his work on this documentary, and there is a discussion with illustrator Cheryl Harness on her contributions.

Produced in association with Friendly Family Productions, Little House on the Prairie: The Legacy of Laura Ingalls Wilder is a must have for any Wilder fan.

I received a free copy of this DVD from Friendly Family Productions. This review contains my honest opinions, which I have not been compensated for in any way.",1441411200,23,2033,5.284829721362229

6868023,5,B00QHM4DI0,"I loved this documentary. As a huge fan of the TV show, I felt that this look at the real -life Laura from the television ""Almanzo"" was the perfect way to merge the book aficionados and television fans. While I am sure some Laura fans may already have known some of this information, it was brand new to me! I did not know much about Laura's writing process and was impressed at how she wrote her autobiography using the techniques of fiction writing. Truman Capote may have thought he ""invented"" the non-fiction novel with ""In Cold Blood,"" but Laura Ingalls Wilder had him beat and not only that, she may have created the YA genre as well. I found this documentary after vowing to myself that I would re-read all of the Little House books this summer and it was a great companion piece to my reading. Well done, Mr. Butler!",1435622400,17,824,4.4635761589403975

I thoroughly enjoyed it and was sad that the program was not longer. I could have seen more and been entertained for hours, but this was privately-produced film, so further filming would have most likely been cost-prohibitive, and I was very satisfied with the excellent film and production quality of this DVD.",1527120000,,440,4.9324324324324325

8691368,5,B00QHM4DI0,"First I watched the DVD movie of Laura's late teen into adult travelling years with Richard Thomas at his best ever as Pa and the other actors remarkably like the Engalls (original spelling) family photos. The remarkable young actress of ""The Patriot"" is immortalized on film movingly playing Laura's daughter Rose before that young actress passed on.

Then I watched this wonderful documentary adding to the movie not only with family photos and heirlooms but on locations and with re-creation acting by location descendants proudly led by the actor who played Laura's husband Almanzo Wilder in the TV series.

The later-years movie and this documentary made me want to watch those TV episodes I missed, and even re-read Laura's books again though written for children but with mature themese and I'd read them now with so much more informed appreciation and deeper emotional engagement like you would your own families' and regions' stories.

I'll be giving the movie and this documentary as gift sets to young and old :)",1506297600,2,1023,5.041420118343195
