8734474,5,B015S4DRFW,"Love this movie!! In todays fast pace, action packed movies where you have trouble following everything this movie has enough mystery and action in it for anyone. It goes at the right pace where you can follow everything that is going on, and you get to know the characters. I don't like todays movies because they move too fast and you can't keep up with everything that is going on (sometimes 10 things at once). I love modern technology but as far as the movies go,  I think they take it too far sometimes. I watched this with my Grandkids and they loved it as well.",1528416000,,569,4.367924528301887
8734475,5,B015S4DRFW,"This 2010 film is another version of the supposed Greek myth. It is, in my view, far superior to the former film. It has more action and is more exciting. There are minor similarities between the two films, but they are very minor, and the general plots in the 2010 version were not in the 1981 version.
While there are many subplots in the 2010 film, the three main ones are: (1) The humans are tired of the gods. They dislike the mistreatments of them by the gods. They dislike as well that they need to pray to the gods because it is prayers that give the gods immortality. (This is a clever idea by the film writers. It is a way of saying if the humans stop thinking about the gods and stop relying on them, the gods would disappear, because they only exist in the human minds.) (2) The current principle god is Zeus who tricked Hades into taking over the underworld, a terrible job. Hades wants to overcome Zeus and take control of the world. (3) Perseus is the son of Zeus by a human female. Zeus seduced his mother by taking the form of her husband. She conceived Perseus. Her husband tossed her and Perseus into the sea. His mother died but he was rescued and raised by nice human family. When the humans tried to rebel against the gods, although Perseus and this family were not involved, the gods killed many humans, including Perseus family.
The god Hades informs humans that they have until the solar eclipse, a relatively short period, to give the kings daughter Andromeda to the snake-like monster Kraken. If they fail to do so. The kings city Argos and its inhabitants will be destroyed. (It can be noted that Kraken is not a Greek figure and does not appear in Greek mythology. It is Scandinavian. This confusion by the film producers does not ruin the film.) Perseus decides to save Andromeda even though in this film he has no romantic feelings about her. He just wants to do all he can to foil any activity by the gods. He discovers that the only way to beat Kraken is to get it to look at the head of Medusa, for anyone who looks at her turns to stone. He undergoes a number of adventures to get the head.
(While the first main plot is that the humans want to disassociate themselves from the gods, and Perseus rejects at first any divine help, he finally accepts the help.)",1526860800,,2294,4.4
