7865984,3,6304258623,"Although the whole family is into Scooby Doo, we all appreciate the original Scoobs more than anything.  This was a cut idea, and it was fun to meet the rest of the families, but it was not the classic mystery style you would expect in a Scooby-Doo.  We rated this a three because it is fun to watch once, but not again and again like the others.  Cannot really pinpoint the reason, but we are glad we got it anyway.",1234742400,,416,4.175
7865985,3,6304258623,"I bought this as a 'gag gift' for someone who's wedding I really don't want to take place, so I was not expecting a whole lot. I loved Scooby-Doo as a kid and didn't care for the introduction of the Scrappy Doo character. That said. The plot is good. I did miss Freddy and Velma though. Daphne suddenly as the 'smart one?' and leader didn't go over very well for me. I enjoyed 'meeting' Scooby and Shaggy's families. What was disappointing was the quality of the production. The sound is terrible and the animation is faded looking, even for the time. I hope this is re-released on DVD and with upgraded sound. The history (both real and character) is interesting to watch. It's worth having, but not in it's present form.",1092009600,,722,4.519083969465649
7865986,3,6304258623,"This is an interesting Scooby tape in that it goes from one extreme to the other. The first episode is on the silly side. I have seen most of Scooby's episodes on tape, and even I have to say this 1st episode is somewhat below the levels Scooby normally offers us, and that it lacks the usual charm of most episodes. The absence of Velmah and Fred take away a cutting edge. Without Fred, we are missing the laid back guy who leads the gang. Without Velmah, we are missing the gang's arguably most intelligent member, not to mention the sassy charm she offers. But then the first episode is not all bad either. It does allow us to meet Scooby's parents as well as Shaggy's parents. And Uncle Gaggy offers some laughs. The 2nd episode on the tape goes to the other extreme. The 2nd episode is actually on the chilling side with an element of historical reality. In Salem Massachusetts, a friend of the gang is suspected of witchcraft, and faces the threat of the angry population. I myself was actually a little nervous while I watched this episode. This is one of those episodes that even older children as well as adults will find interesting. (Parents may wish to consider watching this episode with their children. It is a little on the spooky side.) Overall, I would say even though the first episode is not that good, the second episode makes the tape worth buying.",1005091200,12,1369,4.524193548387097
