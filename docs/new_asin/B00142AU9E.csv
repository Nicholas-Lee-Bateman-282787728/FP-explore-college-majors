8254051,5,B00142AU9E,"This is pure Japanese Hentai Anime. The protagonist is Satoshi Suzuhara. He's a P.I. that puts Magnum and Simon & Simon to shame! This guy has his pick of women--including a gorgeous girl who is deeply in love with him that commits suicide in order to save him and his adopted daughter (Asuka Kashiwagi) from death.

Satoshi is intelligent. With the help of his daughter, girlfriends and good American buddy, he's able to discover the mad scientist behind the murders and the undead who lurk about the American mansion and finally unravels the scientist's dastardly plans. In the process he must overcome being a suspect in multiple murders, the suicide of his lover (?), attempts on his and his daughter's lives and a horrific zombie attack. In the end, however, Satoshi prevails with the help of his adopted daughter. The two love and care for one another and will not allow themselves to be separated.

I highly recommend this DVD. Although the violence was a bit too gory for my tastes, the intense sex and romance more than made up for the previous problem. Simply put, this is DVD has both nudity and strong sexual content (The Sexy Bodies Freak It Left & Right). I give this DVD Five Stars for a solid script with great dialogue, intense sex and nudity galore. Buy this DVD and you won't be disappointed.

8254056,3,B00142AU9E,"This anime shows its age and I only bought it for sentimental reasons.  Very adult content which adds nothing to the story line.  Would give it less stars, but nostalgia kicked in as I watched this when it first came to America on VHS no less.",1379721600,,243,4.260869565217392
8254057,4,B00142AU9E,Glad the entire series was included. decent story and might have been better without the hetai. elements of mystery and police procedural might be something the writer could explore again. Almost felt cable after hours type feature.,1321142400,,232,5.297297297297297
