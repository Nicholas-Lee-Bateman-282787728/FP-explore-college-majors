8741871,4,B018AXRLKK,"Found-footage film about a Bigfoot-type creature in the Australian outback. Very slow build, Americans will need the close captioning. Unique take on this kind of movie, left me wondering about the ""monster."" Great outdoors cinematography.",1459641600,,239,5.857142857142857
8741872,1,B018AXRLKK,"How dare this turd wannabe sci-fi movie steal the title to the 50's!
 TOHO SCI-FI Movie: Half Human. Even though DCA was to cheap to dub it and
had Actor John Carradine narrate and star in scenes like Raymond Burr did for GODZILLA .
That movie displays more creativity and it's use of special effect, gave us a tragic tale of the Man beast of the snowy mountain...
Keep away from this bad joke of a movie. Maybe someday Toho's Half-Human will come out on DVD.",1456185600,,459,4.337209302325581
8741873,2,B018AXRLKK,"the movie guy is right on target with his description...ill start from bomb and work its way up
 1 star for scenes of the pool, the bar, the hotel and the redneck truck
 1 star for the backwoods farmer

but we're left with yet another bigfoot documentary filmed ala blair witch project...2 stars max

no nudity, but you get a clearer shot of a girl's buttcrack getting out of the pool than you do of the creature (2 glowing jack-o-lantern eyes visible through the trees)",1456099200,,470,4.4941176470588236
8741874,1,B018AXRLKK,"Terrible movie, no plot, didn't care if the characters lived or died- complete failure of a movie",1456099200,,97,4.764705882352941
8741875,1,B018AXRLKK,"""There's Something in the Pilliga"" and ""Half Human"" are the same film. This is a found footage film taken in the Outback supposedly a Big Foot type of film. Dylan (Paul Denham) is the ride along filming Jay (Brendan Byrne) a self proclaimed redneck with a thick Aussie accent mate. The accent was thick enough to make me look for an English subtitles option. Nope. None available. These two guys pick up two floozies at a bar on New Years Eve and drive into the woods....and we never see the creature. We hear screaming, have a lot of ground cam, running cam, shoe hurling chunks cam, and people dragged on the ground cam. At one point the women try to act sexy for the cam showing cleavage and simulating sex. The lack of a decent ending killed the feature.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1454889600,,792,4.462068965517242
