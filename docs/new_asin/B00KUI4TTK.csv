8661811,5,B00KUI4TTK,I remember watching this show on TBN many many years ago.  It was on very late at night and only sporadically. I would search for the show after I saw it for the first time but rarely found it. I very much enjoyed it when I was able to see it. It's an excellent show that makes excellent points. It presents issues of the world in a way that makes sense to Christians. There are very few shows that I've ever seen that were better at doing this and none were done in such a short time period.  Each episode is only approximately 25 minutes long. Definitely worth watching each episode more than once!,1521590400,,600,4.254385964912281
