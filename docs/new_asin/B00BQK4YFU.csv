5666627,4,B00BQK4YFU,"It is difficult to ascertain to what, exactly, the title of Quentin Dupieux's latest film refers.  Almost every moment of Wrong defies the logic of narrative filmmaking; every scene is, in essence, a prolonged non-sequitor.  Not that anyone who had seen his previous film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rubber-HD/dp/B008Q00C4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rubber [HD</a>], about a homicidal telekinetic tire, would have expected anything too straightforward from the French musician-turned-filmmaker (who also scores his films under his nom de musique Mr. Oizo).  But whereas everything in Rubber made empirical sense within the film's admittedly outlandish premise (itself a darkly satirical crack on the intersection of voyeurism and consumerism), the individual images of Wrong operate in an almost purely metaphorical sense to create a poetic vernacular with which Dupieux is able to explore wider, more nebulous themes of self denial.

Wrong`s protagonist Dolph Springer (played with wonderful aplomb by Jack Plotnick), is, presumably, a travel agent.  Or rather, was a travel agent.  Despite having been fired three months prior, Dolph still reports for work every day, much to the mounting chagrin of his co-workers.  In their office, it is inexplicably always raining.  Or maybe it's just the fire sprinklers.  Either way, no one in the office seems to mind, or to think that this is in any way out of the ordinary.

One morning, Dolph wakes up to find that his dog Paul is missing.  Dolph's quest to locate his prodigal pet is the essence of the film's threadbare plot; where the film excels -- and, indeed, where one senses the influence of Luis Bunuel, David Lynch, and such psychologically impressionistic works as Alain Resnais'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Last-Year-at-Marienbad-The-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B001WLMOHI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Last Year at Marienbad (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray</a>] - is in its ability to shuttle its protagonist through a series of social interactions whose outcomes do more to illustrate Dolph's phenomenological perspective and to inform his lifeworld than to expedite the resolution of his practical dilemma.

This doesn't quite make Dolph's dog a MacGuffin like the suitcase in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pulp-Fiction-Blu-ray/dp/B001AQT0Z4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pulp Fiction [Blu-ray</a>] (which, despite motivating all the action of the film, is ultimately of no consequence to the audience's interest in or understanding of the story), but something more akin to Bunny, Tara Reid's character in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Big-Lebowski-Blu-ray-DVD-Digital-Copy-Universal-s-100th-Anniversary/dp/B007N31ZKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Big Lebowski [Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy] (Universal's 100th Anniversary)</a>, albeit with one noteworthy difference: though both Dolph and The Dude's odysseys are more&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Candy/dp/0802134297/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Candy</a>&nbsp;than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Candide/dp/1475197780/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Candide</a>, the Coen Brothers -- taking as much from the hardboiled crime fictions of Raymond Chandler as from Bunuel and the absurdists -- were meticulous in setting up and grounding their flights of visual fancy in a rigorously crafted series of cascading events.  For Dupieux, plotting is more about accumulation than progression, and it is only through an analogous, connotative reading of the images that we can recognize an authorial thematic cohesion.

Every morning, Dolph wakes up as his alarm clock changes from 7:59 to 7:60, staunchly and resolutely resisting the passage of time.  The clock, the routine return to a job he no longer possesses, and the innumerable photographs and paintings of himself and Paul adorning his home all illustrate a futile effort to stave off the onset of change, to manifest an illusory permanence.  Why such anxiety in the face of progress?  Dolph, clearly a fastidious and fussy-minded fellow, places a phone call to a local pizzeria to question the integrity of their logo, which is a rabbit riding a motorcycle.  If the rabbit is meant to represent the speed with which the pizza is delivered, isn't it overkill to put him on a motorcycle?  Furthermore, isn't the motorcycle's alacrity an invariable, unbeholden to the personal celeritous qualifications of its driver?  Dolph clearly has some difficulty seeing the forest from the trees.

Any other pizzeria employee would have grown frustrated and hung up, but for Emma (Alexis Dziena), who tends toward vapidity, this is the most interesting conversation of her life.  Dolph hangs up without ordering a pizza, but Emma sends him one anyway.  He throws it into the garbage, from which his gardener Victor (Eric Judor) procures it for his lunch.  Inside, Victor finds an astonishingly explicit note in which Emma tenders her phone number and her body to Dolph.  Victor calls Emma, pretending to be Dolph, and arranges an illicit rendezvous with Emma.  Though she finds it odd that Dolph has suddenly acquired a thick French accent, this does not deter her, and following their tryst she declares that she intends to leave her husband for him.

The real Dolph, meanwhile, sets off to meet the mysterious Master Chang (an inspired William Fichtner), a soft spoken zen-master-type who confides that the company he founded seven years ago has kidnapped Paul.  The purpose of this unusual service is to teach pet owners a lesson; ""I only realized I loved my face after it had been burned with acid,"" Chang illustrates, alluding to -- but not explaining -- the scars which cover half of his face.  Nevermind that Dolph is a doting owner to Paul, whom he considers his best friend -- Chang selects his involuntary clients at random, and promptly returns their pets unharmed.  Except that the van which was carrying Paul randomly caught fire, killing the kidnapper.  Paul, luckily, escaped the van, but is now missing for real.

Chang hires a detective (Steve Little) to find Paul and gives Dolph a copy of his book My Life, My Dog, My Strength, which he claims will teach Dolph how to telepathically communicate with Paul.  Dolph, however, is unable to concentrate on the book now that Emma -- who finds it only a little strange that Dolph looks nothing like the man with whom she had sex the night prior -- has, as promised, left her husband and moved in with him.  Detective Ronnie, meanwhile, is successfully able to extract the memories from the feces Paul expelled on the front lawn just before he was kidnapped, but the resultant video does nothing more than confirm Chang's story.  Feel free to reread that last sentence, and then decide whether or not this is your kind of movie.

I could go on, describing what literally happens in each scene of the film, but that is to miss the point.  The beauty of Wrong lies in its incongruity.  Every character is so entrenched in self-delusion and denial that their entire lives exist in direct contradiction to logic.  In one of Wrong`s earliest scenes, Dolph's neighbor Mike (Regan Burns) vehemently denies that he has ever jogged -- insists that he categorically abhors running in general -- despite the fact that Dolph has seen him out jogging almost every morning.  Mike then announces that he's leaving for an indeterminate amount of time to an indeterminate location.  He has no plans and no expectations, he simply needs a change.

Much later in the film, Mike calls Dolph from what he calls ""the end of the world"" -- a barren expanse of caked earth under an oppressive white sky -- to apologize for lying about jogging and wonder aloud why he feels compelled to deny this part of his personality, but he quickly reverts to deriding the act and insisting he does not take part in it.  In the image of Mike's car speeding across the infinite, we recognize the human mind; with no points of reference along the horizon, we acknowledge the contextual imperative of truth and the inherent limitations of our own perceptive faculties.

By leaving his home -- by abandoning all of the external signifiers of his existence in order to, in essence, escape the truth -- and retaining only a firmly held conviction that stands in blatant disregard of all logic and empirical fact, Mike has become untethered from any concept or semblance of reality, drifting through an empty life just as his car drifts through an empty landscape.  The human mind is frighteningly capable of deluding itself, especially when one refuses to rectify one's interior and exterior selves, as pretty much everyone in Wrong does.

Master Chang speaks on multiple occasions about the verity of choice and the individual's ability to act either in accordance to or in spite of logic, which would seem to indict Mike.  But there's also the matter of Mike's admission that he has a ""block"", his awareness of his disconnect with reality.  In this regard, the image of Mike's car evokes not only the absence of context but also the presence of possibility; with every change comes the opportunity to redefine one's self.  Is his denial endemic to his context, or does it beget his context?  Or are meaning and existence mutually endemic, neither able to exist autonomously?

Wrong is more interested in these questions than their answers, which may frustrate some viewers, but to offer any sense of objectivity or imply any sort of universality would be to contradict itself.  Dupieux is too smart to offer easy answers in a movie about the malleability of truth; instead he trusts the audience to innately understand his images in abstract, even if the precise meaning -- which grows ever more amorphous the closer we get to it -- perpetually eludes us.  Not that any of this particularly explains the bit about the dog, but perhaps that's the real difference between a MacGuffin and a metaphor, the difference between prose and poetry: the briefcase in Pulp Fiction could be holding anything, whereas the dog in Wrong could be anything.

5666648,2,B00BQK4YFU,"I LOVE William Fichtner. So much so, that I believe he is THE BEST actor in film, & doesn't get the notoriety that he deserves!  This is why I struggled through this movie, as his acting was wonderful as always. However, what a waste of time!  I'd given it to a coworker to watch, & she said it was odd...didn't really make sense. When she gave it back & I watched it the following weekend, all I could think was, ""WHY did she keep watching, when it's such a BAD movie?""  I told her on Monday that I couldn't believe she'd actually watched the whole thing!  I vowed never to loan her another movie unless I'd watched it first. I'm a huge animal lover -- another reason I watched the movie. But even the animal theme can't redeem this terrible movie.",1417219200,2,749,4.290780141843972
5666649,5,B00BQK4YFU,"Is there anyone else out there who wished that I Heart Huckabees, that 2004 David O Russell existentialsurrealist masterpiece about living as a white suburbanite with a conscience during the Bush 43 era were at least 90 minutes longer? Hands? I mean, what a refreshing breath of open-mindedness that was...just idea after idea I would have thought impossible to see in such a mainline venue. Wrong (2012, written and directed by Quentin Dupieux) is without a doubt the direct descendent of Russell's IHH, and it makes me understand better why the magic of that movie worked so well. One part of the key is that although the whole work is intensely surreal, almost an Ionesco play, there are really no special effects...if you watched the movie without sound, you might totally miss every hint of oddity.
The one thing you wouldn't miss here is the very first moment of the movie, when we watch an old-school alarm radio clock (the kind with rectangular panels that flip over to reveal new numbers every time a minute passes) changes its display from 07:59 to 07:60. And our hero, one Dolph Springer (Jack Plotnick--my God, where did this guy come from? He's a brilliant comic! He can carry a plot like Bob Newheart, Bill Cosby or Jerry Seinfeld can, by mostly playing it straight but providing this huge comedy safety net for everybody else involved) wakes up to find that his dog, Paul, has run away.
Or more accurately, has been kidnapped by the sinister Master Chang (William Fichtner). And as if that weren't enough, look what else is happening to the poor everyman: that tall palm tree in his backyard? It's metamorphosed overnight into a medium sized pine. And the flyer he received from that new pizza restaurant, Jesus Organic Pizza. There's something unsettling about the logo: a rabbit on a motorcycle carrying a bunch of pizza boxes. The rabbit symbolizes the speed of delivery, but what about the motorcycle? Why would a fast rabbit need a motorcycle. Think about it long enough an it will begin to BLOW YOUR MIND!!!
The quote I used in my headline comes from Detective Ronnie (Steve Little) who uses state-of-the-art technology to determine that Paul has been kidnapped (something that we the viewers and Dolph already learned in Act I of the film): through careful investigation he discovered one of Paul's dried poops on the lawn. He then accessed its memories and transformed them into video images of the inside of Paul's large intestines on the day of the kidnapping.
I can't end this review without mentioning the excellent performances of Eric Judor as the gardener Victor (who dies of a heart attack, shows back up, kills a girl with a broken bottle, and then ends up inside a coffin with a glass lid, laughing in relief as the dirt rains down), and Alexis Dziena as Emma, the sexy-as-all-get-out Jesus Organic Pizza phone girl who falls for Dolph over the phone, then molests Victor, thinking him Dolph. She falls in love immediately, dumps her husband, and moves into the real Dolph's place. When she sees Dolph, she doesn't recognize him, but accepts that it must still be the same man she slept with the night before. But the real Dolph has no clue what to do with her, and when Victor reappears Emma says ""You've changed again. I think I like you better this way.""
Interesting, huh, that in both I Heart Huckabees and Wrong the hero has a muscle-bound ally, almost a second self, who gets the girl, gets all the sexual action really. I think that this is a reflection of the fact that in America, if you're too circumspect, too introspect, too philosophical, too moved by wisdom, you just definitely aren't getting any. At least you have to deal with long stretches of not getting any, as you wait for the precious exception: someone who speaks your language.",1407283200,,3785,4.771341463414634
5666650,5,B00BQK4YFU,"I like to Escape into the bizarre and whack world of Quentin Dupeiux - it is a world of subtlety veiled insanity - like a realistic dream where the details are so involved that you wake up swearing ""That FLIPPING Happened!"" then you exhale a sigh of relief, brush your teeth, throw some clothes on, choke down a protein drink and realize your 9-5 may not be so mundane. Well...maybe not .. Mr. Dupeiux's films are a welcome surprise in a mundane world of cinema.  Excuse, just going to order a pizza - actually I may not order it - depends on who delivers it & how they present it. I prefer it to be delivered by a lone psychotic tire named Robert.",1403049600,,648,4.2682926829268295
5666651,5,B00BQK4YFU,Just what i had expected and more; Mr. Oizo fan through and thru. this has great humour and style. word.,1396656000,,104,4.25
5666652,4,B00BQK4YFU,"I've been a fan of Mr. Oizo (Quentin Dupieux) since he made his first album, 'Analog Worms Attack.' I think he has a great sense of humor when it comes to art. His films are like his music. Really quirky, funny and weird but very polarizing. There's also a cool factor to his work, it's hip in a Dada-ist nonsense kinda way. At the end of the day, you either you like his stuff or you don't.

I like it. I think it's a really funny movie and that it's definitely worth watching. If you are looking for something funny that's really different and weird. You'll love it!",1389744000,,568,4.2592592592592595
5666653,5,B00BQK4YFU,"Absurdist agendas are designed to be met with confusion; It is the most basic aspect of their design and orientation towards an imagined audience, and Quintin Dupieux (AKA the equally absurd recording artist and remixer, ""Mr OIzo"") is a master of the form, not the exception. Absurdity, however, is not limited to eliciting confusion, obviously, because some people are uncomfortable with the feeling, some are stimulated by the open-ended food-for-thought possibilities of meaning and the constant unexpected nature of this form, while others find a lot of humor in the absurd. Obviously we know which of these reactions is paramount for Dupieux, and that is humor. But, if we switch to a more terrifying absurdist, like David Lynch, humor is still in the mix, but it's more of a coping mechanism for the viewer to have an awkward laugh between tense music-driven scenes, because Lynch's work focuses on suspense first.

The film Wrong is not about randomness though. In many ways it is a very focused spoof of Lynch, right down to the score. By placing tense strings and forward-moving drum machines in just the right places, Dupieux manages to honor rather than mock Lynch, while at the same time entirely transforming the Lynchian brand of suspense film into the Dupieux brand of comedy.

It helps that the acting and camerawork here are executed with a precise chemistry that is entirely consistent with his prior film ""Rubber."" Of course Rubber also fits into the category of b-movie horror, because, well, you can't make a movie about a deadly tire and it only be considered a comedy; people's head's explode too much not to also place it alongside movies like ""Sharknado.""

However, with Wrong, it is 100% comedy, even more so than it is an indie or art film. It's a comedy along the lines of You, Me, and Everyone We Know, or Junebug, in which the line is blurred between dry comedy, dark comedy, absurdist comedy, and art house comedy. What pries it from the grips of purely another weirdo low budget art film, however, is the sheer volume of respectable actors paired with Oizo's crystal-clear camera selection, lighting, and just the overall extreme hi-fi feeling of quality.

I love absurdism; I love all the confusion, the awkward laughs,and the possibilities of meaning, as well as the opportunity to forgo meaning entirely and take it as surface illogical visual stimulus. However, I would not recommend Rubber to my wife or anyone who avoids stupid movies, and I already recommended this to my wife and brother. The only thing wrong with this movie is that it could be considered a tad short if your expecting anything like a big feature film. It's more like Pootie Tang, which is to say a condensed comedic style experiment, though far more classy and artistic overall than Pootie Tang, just not quite as ""real"" as the other comedies I mentioned because it's not as dark.",1384819200,2,2889,4.889795918367347

5666683,5,B00BQK4YFU,"If you're not familiar with Quentin Dupieux, you can start slowly. Watch a few of the music videos he made for his own music (Mr Oizo) as well as for others. Assuming that you had a good laugh and/or that your head started to shake on the beat, you may be ready for what's next.

It's always hazardous to compare a director to another but we'll have to agree that Quentin Dupieux is ideologically closer to Spike Jonze (being John Malkovitch) and Michel Gondry (Eternal Sunshine.../science of dreams) than he is to Michael Bay.

It's surreal, it's really well done, with good actors, great and efficient cinematography and a smart use of music ( that he's co-signing). It's sweet by times, really funny overral, and not like anything you've seen so far.
It's a director's work in a sense that Dupieux is behind the wheel with a total creative control (clap clap clap) and it's not for everybody and oh do we love that !

All of the enjoyment of this movie comes from layered absurdity - notable because of the artfulness of the situations (it definitely isn't American slapstick). Speaking of artfulness, the movie has a very pleasant bout of cinematography and soundtrack, making it a very well rounded comedy. I'll be sticking it back in my player more than a few times.
