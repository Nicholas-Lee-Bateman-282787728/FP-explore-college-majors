7870769,5,6304401019,"Quack Pack was a short-lived but excellent '90's afternoon animated series from Disney. Donald Duck is still living with his mischevious nephews Huey, Louie, and Dewey, but they're now teenagers. Donald works as a camera man and Daisy is a TV reporter for a tabloid news show. Together the group of ducks get into crazy adventures they constantly have to get themselves out of. In this video we find the gang visiting a haunted house on Halloween. Great fun for the whole family. Well animated and very entertaining!",998870400,6,516,4.875
