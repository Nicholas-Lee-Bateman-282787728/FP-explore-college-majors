2772224,3,B000NKOGL6,I chose this DVD for a 9 month old who watches animated DVDs  for 20 minutes or more. I assumed this Sherry Lewis DVD featured Lamb Chops (whom the 9 month old loves) but LC was barely present. The DVD was in black and white and too mundane for younger children.,1397260800,3,262,4.137254901960785
2772225,5,B000NKOGL6,Got it for my 3 year old grand daughter. I think her mom liked it even more. Still a favorite show for moms and kids.,1394236800,,117,3.72
2772226,4,B000NKOGL6,Bought for kids as these old shows are so wholesome for young kids. Better then a lot of current cartoons,1384041600,,105,4.3
2772227,5,B000NKOGL6,"My little two-year-old granddaughter wants to watch this every day.  I guess that's success. I got this with the Lamb Chop puppet, and together they make the perfect gift.",1373155200,,171,4.896551724137931

2772230,3,B000NKOGL6,"Got this movie because I couldn't find Lamb Chops Playhouse anywhere for purchase.  Not really worth the trade off, it's a very different Lamb Chop then the one I watched as a kid.  That being said, my son really enjoys it so it serves its purpose.",1325808000,3,248,4.369565217391305

2772232,4,B000NKOGL6,"This DVD has a description on it that does not match what is shown in the video.  The shows on this DVD do not feature the characters ""Hush Puppy"" or ""Charlie Horse"" as stated on the DVD cover.  The shows are still good and Shari's main character, Lambchop, does appear on the DVD.",1249948800,8,281,4.283018867924528
2772233,5,B000NKOGL6,I allow my children to watch and rewatch this show with no worries of suggestive or questionable materials.  I just pop it into the DVD in our van while we travel.  We laugh all the way to our destination.,1185235200,19,205,4.230769230769231
8179188,2,B000NKOGL6,my fault not what I wanted,1509148800,,26,3.5
8179189,1,B000NKOGL6,"the show is ??? some original mabe that is unfamiliar and just not so good, we didn't like.  I really don't like when companies/people make the return cost the same as or even  more than the show---honestly put, it should read ""no returns"" then.  I will be remembering to try to keep my buys to amazon prime only anymore.  This is the second time returns were welcome, no problem and then the return costs more than keeping the product...is dishonest.  At least this one did not cost alot",1487808000,,488,4.5
