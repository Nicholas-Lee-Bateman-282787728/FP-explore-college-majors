7824522,1,6302281687,"nickerbocker10, Winnie the Pooh is just a cartoon. Not a real Show. Cartoons don't show little kids how to do the right things. Real Shows do. Winnie the Pooh isn't a real show. This show is a funny cartoon. It makes me laugh a lot. Not learn a lot. My little brother, Grant says it's funny, too. He's a little kid and he knows how to do right things. I'm  not a little kid and my favorite TV show is Winnie the Pooh. Why would it show little kids how to do the right things, nickerbocker10? Why? It has Freindship and Playtime sets, too. You play on the Playtime ones along with them and Be Friends with them on the Friendship ones. It's not a real show.",1013126400,2,655,4.15748031496063
