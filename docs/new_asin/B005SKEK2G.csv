8485229,5,B005SKEK2G,"An excellent presentation with intelligent and documented explanations of hard to understand religious material.  The expertise and knowledge of these two men are not just academic but their responses are given in a compelling and compassionate manner.  There is no vitriolic or rancorous attack against Islam, but echoes of respect can be heard through their Christian voice by stating ""peace be upon him"" when a name of a prophet of Islam is used in their dialogue.  I highly recommend this DVD for anyone desiring to obtain a greater clarity of understanding the ""Message of the Scriptures.""",1453334400,,594,5.166666666666667
