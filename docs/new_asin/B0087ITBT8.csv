5135289,5,B0087ITBT8,"GUILT TRIP is a welcome change from most films Hollywood powerbrokers tend to finance.  Like HOPE SPRINGS which was released earlier this year, this film is NOT the sidesplitting  comedy one would expect to see from the theatrical trailers promoting the film.  Instead it is a warm and endearing film focusing on a relationship between mother and adult son.  This is one of Streisand's most subdued but convincing performances in years.  She is not the larger than life persona we've seen in previous films.  Rogen gives a nice performance as Andy, a character very unlike others he's created in past films.  This is definitely a film I'll enjoy watching from time to time and sharing with friends.",1357257600,86,698,4.914529914529915
5135290,3,B0087ITBT8,"Saw this at the movies this weekend with my sister, cousin and aunt.  In general we all seemed to like it (including the audience from what we could tell) but none of us raved about it...just a general like. A little humor but not the laugh out loud kind just a few things that might tickle your humor bone and make you smile/grin (or nudge your movie partner because you recognize that comment or trait in someone you know).

Overall it was a nice story with a nice ending and mom and son are closer and better off for having been on that road trip - though it was not without the necessary emotional bumps and bruises that come with growth (or just plain being together).

Well cast and good camera work.

BOTTOM LINE:  it's NOT a ""must see"" movie you'll love to watch over and over and tell all your friends they ""have"" to see it -- but it was a nice story worth seeing when you get around to it.

BTW ladies if you get fake nails please note Barbara's nails in this movie - THAT'S how a GOOD nail job should look.  Not those huge 1-inch wide, square, thick, crappy looking ones most women choose.  (Trust Barbara to get it right!)",1356825600,9,1161,4.362790697674418
5135291,5,B0087ITBT8,"I took my dad to see this movie. A couple years back I lost my mother, coincidentally my mother and I went to see A mirror has two faces the last movie she released where Barbra was the star. In one scene, halfway through the movie an incident happens and it changes the dynamics of this movie. Anyway, I sat there at the end when others were laughing and tears were rolling down my eyes. I can remember similar situations with my mother, I loved her but I'm also a gay male, I wasn't the only child but the distance between my eldest brother and I (I'm the baby) is 10 years. I also was the gay male so I can understand the story plot very well. Would I see it again, I have, this time alone, still cried at the end but it was a good cry. Now don't get me wrong the ending is not sad, but I loved my mother, she was my friend and as we get older they tend to become our friend, just wish I had more time with her. Excellent movie, really!",1356393600,89,939,3.9735449735449735
5135292,3,B0087ITBT8,"I'll admit it...I got suckered by the previews for THE GUILT TRIP.  Although I'm not a big fan of Barbra Streisand, the movie looked like a bit of a guilty pleasure...a mis-matched road trip with mother & son.  Rogen and Streisand appeared to actually have pretty good chemistry together, and while I figured the laughs would be cheap and obvious, they might also be plentiful.

Well, I was roughly half right.  The laughs WERE cheap and obvious, but not very plentiful.  And many of the best ones were shown in the previews (and some of THOSE were not in the movie until the closing credits ""deleted scene"" montage).  The chemistry WAS there, but it included a lot more sadness and anger than such a lightweight movie really could carry.

Rogen plays Streisand's chemist son.  After years working with the EPA, he has developed a wonderful, renewable, totally safe and effective home cleaning product and has invested everything into selling it to big retail establishments.  He is, in fact, about to launch a cross-country road trip, starting in New Jersey in an effort to sell his product.  It just so happens that his mother lives right there, so he spends a couple of days visiting her too.  He feels bad that his mother is a bit lonely (she's been a widow for over 20 years), so he impulsively invites her to accompany him on his 8-day road trip.  Hilarity ensues (or at least, it should).

Turns out Rogen is a terrible sales-person...and his pitch meetings with the corporate types are more pathetic than funny.  He's so awkward and ill-prepared.  It stretches credulity, especially when it's actually played fairly straight, rather than for broad laughs.

And it turns out that Streisand is quite annoying.  Yes, she's annoying to her son with her constant chattering.  Her steady mix of over-bearing mother and condescending critic.  Yes, she's clearly a stereotypical ""Jewish mother"" and who better to play her?  But it all begins to blend together as just so much noise in our heads, and probably that's the way Rogen hears it too!

The plot itself (will Rogen make a sale, will Streisand meet a guy) is quite predictable, and yields few surprises.  BUT, if you saw the trailer, you likely are not expecting big surprises or innovation.  The film doesn't need to surprise us.

The two stars do have some amusing exchanges...don't misunderstand me.  Streisand does something outrageous and Rogen mumbles something under his breath that is amusing.  But there are very few out-loud laughs to be had.  The movie has a tough time finding a balance between its moments of near slapstick with its more serious encounters.  There is a lot of pain and sadness that these two characters are burdened with, and this hangs like a weight around a movie that clearly wants to be light on its feet and even wacky.

It's possible to strike a balance like that (Apatow has done it numerous times and Rogen certainly can do it)...but THE GUILT TRIP misses out.  But don't get me wrong...it is modestly entertaining and amusing, and while I can't recommend you run right out and see it, don't let it completely pass you by either.  I should also say, at the risk of sounding like a fuddy-duddy, that it's probably going to be more amusing for fans of Barbra than for fans of Seth Rogen.  Despite bursts of bad language, it has a decidedly old-fashioned feel to it that might equate to ""too slow"" for a generation more accustomed to the rhythms of THE HANGOVER.",1355961600,10,3454,4.752941176470588
5135293,4,B0087ITBT8,"Aside from her near-cameo appearances in two ensemble comedies, Barbra Streisand has not starred in a movie in sixteen long years, not since 1996's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mirror-Has-Two-Faces/dp/B0019TSI8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mirror Has Two Faces</a>&nbsp;which she also directed. Her output as an actress has been meager since around 1980 when she started directing films, building houses and returning to the concert stage periodically, so it was with both great anticipation and some trepidation that I saw this light-hearted 2012 comedy. What a relief to find she hasn't missed a beat in her sharp comedy timing. I think she's terrific as Joyce Brewster, the energetically overbearing mother of Andy, an organic chemical engineer who long ago moved to California and has recently invented a cleaning solution he is pitching to various store chains headquartered across the country. He plans a weekend visit with Joyce in New Jersey, but upon an intriguing discovery about her past, he invites her on an eight-day cross-country road trip with him.

As directed by Anne Fletcher (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Proposal/dp/B004X75RK4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Proposal</a>) and written by Dan Fogelman (the underrated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crazy-Stupid-Love/dp/B003Y5H574/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crazy, Stupid, Love</a>) who based his script on his own late mother, the film is about how their two mismatched personalities unsurprisingly clash at every stop as their relationship twists and turns with each new humiliation for Andy and each new revelation for the both of them, a few of them quite poignant. The film is at its comedic best when she and co-star Seth Rogen as Andy volley back and forth with her well-meaning thoughts and antics at odds with his spiky annoyance at anything she says or does. Rogen plays against type as the coiled-up Andy since his stoner-dude personality has been the basis of much of his previous comedy. Here he needs to show some dramatic gravity (as he did earlier this year in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Take-This-Waltz/dp/B0086213XW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Take This Waltz</a>) and again does surprisingly well when necessary. There is a confrontation scene between the two characters that I wish could have gone on a bit longer and deeper than it did, but he manages to bring a real edge to the film in ways I didn't quite expect from him.

Of course there are predictable comedy pieces that also work like a steak-eating contest in Texas where Joyce has to down a fifty-ounce piece of beef in an hour to avoid a $100 tab. There's also quite a supporting cast here, but like Streisand movies of yore, the familiar actors contribute moments that amount to nearly bit parts. Kathy Najimy and Miriam Margolyes are among Joyce's Weight Watchers friends in a quick dinner scene early in the story, while Adam Scott and Ari Graynor show up at the very end of the road trip in San Francisco. In between are appearances by Brett Cullen as a cowboy who becomes smitten with Joyce during the eating contest and Nora Dunn as an officious HSN TV hostess. But that's fine since Rogen really lets Streisand dominate the movie all the way from pushing off potential suitors at a mature singles mixer to getting into the wrong car at a mini-mart pit-stop to getting drunk in a motel bar to sharing her innocently ignorant perceptions of stereotypes. This is only her 19th film since her extraordinary debut in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Funny-Girl/dp/B008Y78GYI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Funny Girl</a>&nbsp;44 years ago, reason enough to enjoy the warm, accomplished performance she gives here.",1354406400,122,3892,5.898936170212766

This movie totally surprised me. Streisand and Rogen play well off each other. The movie didn't need to resort to gross-out humor to get laughs. Not that I object to that kind of stuff, but most of Rogen's movies seem to only have that. If you're a big Seth Rogen fan, this may not be the movie for you because it isn't like his usual movies.

5135601,4,B0087ITBT8,It was cute and heartwarming but not a movie that I would watch over and over. I absolutely loved Barbara Streissand. Seth Rogen perfectly portrayed her dorky son. I also liked the fact that I did not correctly predict the ending; several elements surprised me which is always nice. The relationship between mother and son was very believable and reminded me a little of my husband and his mother (constant arguing and invasions of privacy).,1433376000,,441,4.8933333333333335

It was an enjoyable film, nothing too complex, just enjoyable. It's a ""small"" film. Some movies are like that and they have their place, too.

I would watch it again just to hear Barbra say ""It was a slutty year for Mommy""  Gurl, I hope I never need that line.  There may be a thing or two the kids just don't need to know. ;>",1432252800,,523,3.942857142857143

Update:  I just finished watching the movie and I have switched my rating from two stars to three. If you can get through the first 40 minutes of this movie, then it is watchable. It even made me cry a couple of different times when she and her son actually bonded. Is it a great movie with fabulous acting? No. Is it a great movie with brilliant dialogue? No. If you are a parent like myself, it will warm your heart towards the end of the movie.

5135919,4,B0087ITBT8,"Like NEBRASKA, GUILT TRIP portrays the relationship between parents and children as durable and noble.  And like NEBRASKA, the plot of GUILT TRIP is driven by an adult son's decision to indulge his parent's wishes.  Road trips, their adventures and misadventures, are the spine of both narratives.  However, the cordiality extended to the mother and son in GUILT TRIP by acquaintances who have no compelling reason to welcome long-lost friendships into their homes seems a tad contrived.  Thus, the funniest aspect of GUILT TRIP is that the most guilt-tripped people in the movie are those who are forced to embrace a past that turns up uninvited on their doorsteps.  Pursuing its serious subtext, GUILT TRIP, like NEBRASKA,  illuminates the process by which an adult child and aging parent form a mutually loving and rewarding bond.  When the increasingly self-sufficient sons in GUILT TRIP and NEBRASKA cease to resent their increasingly vulnerable parents as authority figures, they begin to respect themselves as much as their parents as worthy, if flawed, people.  GUILT TRIP and NEBRASKA advance a conservative, arguably hackneyed, thesis using many of the most sophisticated resources (polished script, transparent cinematography, convincing supporting performers) of a famously liberal industry.  Both movies are worthy contributions to twenty-first-century Americana.",1427760000,,1376,5.608695652173913

The movie is pretty formulaic. Nagging mom, annoyed son, incredibly predictable. But it is ultimately a sweet movie. Don't go in to it expecting something life-changing. I do kind of hate seeing both of them in this movie, because I think they could find more worthwhile projects. That being said, it's sweet, and not a bad way to spend an hour and a half or so. I appreciate the chemistry between the two, and I really could identify with the emotion and even the actions of the two main characters. As stereotypical as they are, movies about family dynamics really do almost always ring true. I could see how people could be annoyed by either or both of the characters because they're such exaggerated versions of themselves at the beginning. And do NOT go in expecting hilarity! There were not nearly as many funny moments in this movie as I expected.",1427414400,,1015,4.638888888888889

5136154,5,B0087ITBT8,"This film is packaged to look ordinary; a date movie. The title, ""The Guilt Trip"" adds to that, whereas the title has several possible meanings. Then the cast: Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen, two of our most versatile and confusing actors, one gets into this film expecting a typical, safe Hollywood comedy where all the best bits are in the trailer.
  Instead we get a script as clever as something Sorkin would write and we see two of the finest performances these two have ever given.
  Rogen is a remarkable actor, making every moment honest and in no way a catagory actor. He's a character actor who belongs in lead rles like Dustin Hoffman or Meryl Streep. And his Oscar is coming. He plays Andy, an unmarried scientist who is marketing a new green cleaning product. He's set up pitch meetings at corporations from New York to San Francisco. His ability to wow them in the board room is like Rosie O'Donnell ballroom dancing with Woody Allen. No one's buying it. But he's got a heart of gold and Rogen's eyes show it with every blink and every blush. He has arranged to take this cross country trip with his mother, a widow since Andy was a boy, and she nags him about finding a nice girl as much as he nags her to find a nice man. Rogen's in the A list here, in a two character film with a living legend and he not only makes it look easy, he knocks it out of the park.
  Then there's Streisand who, in the course of a 50 year career as a superstar never delivers exactly what we expect. We've seen Streisand from ""Hello, gorgeous"" to ""Eunice? That's a person named Eunice??"" We know to expect high quality from Streisand no matter what she does and occassionally it gets too easy to just expect that.
  So Barbra Streisand in ""The Guilt Trip."" Delivers top quality again but we're surprised because we don't get what we expected and we see a pure character we've never seen before.
  Streisand also acts with her eyes, so pairing her with Rogen (the two are executive producers) is sheer brilliance but more so we didn't expect it. Her performance here is Oscar worthy, as has been much of her work, though her last Oscar for acting was ""Funny Girl"" in the 60's, even after Billy Crystal's very obvious slam to the Academy when ""The Prince of Tides"" was nominated for seven Oscars except Streisand as best director. (In a fantastic musical opening to the tune of Jule Styne's ""Don't Rain On My Parade "" he sang:
  ""Did this film direct itself?""
All four major awards went to ""Silence of The Lambs"" that year but in 1991 it became clear, by failing to nominate her at all as director, producer and actor, that the Academy was not going to nominate Streisand.
  Since then there was no other definative evidence but with ""The Guilt Trip"" it's clear that to overlook her performance was intentional. That's how good she is. Streisand plays Joyce, Rogen's mother, and she is comfortable within the parameters of her simple life but this cross country trip pulls her out of her comfort zones and she becomes very vulnerable yet stronger.
  In their rental car she has brought Jeffrey Eugenides' ""Middlesex"" book on CD, a brilliant novel about a hermaphrodite who struggles to become whole. The choice of this award winning novel is apt and not at all an accident. Both mother and son have duplicitously, though innocently, arranged for the other to reunite with their first love and it is the power of these meetings, the truths that unfold and how brilliantly these two actors pull it off that makes this film remarkable.
  As the trip unfolds so does their relationship and we find bits of ourselves in them as a parent; as a child. The film is about love but more so about unity. There are some wonderful moments of hilarity but the beautiful honest moments are what makes this film a delightful surprise. We're not watching Streisand and Rogen, we're with Andy and Joyce Brewster.
  And we're with them all the way. This is an excellent film that's about something.",1424563200,,3973,4.576868829337094

A talented chemical engineer is about to embark on a business trip across America to sell his new product. After a brief stop to visit his heartbroken mom, he invites her along hoping to reunite her with her old boyfriend.

What did I think?

It reads more like a horror movie  a road trip with your mother! While the nagging might be a deterrent for some, Seth Rogan and Barbra Streisand work well together. Streisands overprotectiveness and the duos light banter fuels their journey across America in a way thats entertaining enough albeit cliched.

5136584,4,B0087ITBT8,"I'm a huge fan of Barbra Streisand so knowing that she is usually very picky about what she does I felt certain I would enjoy this movie.  She didn't disappoint.  I enjoyed her character and saw a lot of my mother in her.  Seth Rogen is always a delight to watch too and I felt he played the son with earnest.  I only gave this movie 4 rather than 5 stars because I felt it was almost too cursory.  I thought there could have been more funny incidents during a 3000 mile trek across the country.  I also expected, and was disappointed that dear Mom didn't take over one of the sales pitches, or at least the last one.  I thought it would have been great to have the Mother character rescue her son from one of his many failed sales pitch sessions by taking over the sales pitch herself, and the powers-at-be trying to recruit both mother and son to partner in selling his EPA-approved products.  Perhaps a lead-in to that would have been a scene early in the movie when she is actually used and liked her's sons product. Perhaps a scene were she accidentally tasted it - since she pushed him to taste the product as one of his gimmicks to make his one and only sale.  That would have been a hoot.  Good movie for light entertainment.  Definitely more of a girls (or Mom's) night out movie than a date night movie.",1416355200,,1313,4.296747967479675

Seriously. It. Is. That. Terrible. P.S. the only reason for the one-star rating is that Amazon won't let me give a negative rating (to compensate me for the approximately 45 minutes of my life which were stolen from me before I turned it off - it was either that or suicide. I'm not kidding - I would have rather gone to traffic school - twice - on a Saturday).",1415318400,,721,4.3088235294117645

If I ran the world, I'd take the word ""hilarious"" off of the package. It's not hilarious. It has it's moments here and there, most of which are predictable, but this one won't keep you in stitches. I think its beauty is found in Streisand's acting. It's not her best role, but she shines as the fretting, fussy, overprotective mother taking a road trip with her son.

I was pleased to find I was wrong on both fronts. Rogan delivers a great performance as the straight man and Streisand steals the movie as the over caring, guilt delivering, sometimes bumbling, always well meaning single mother.

You were lucky if occasionally there was a hand-held game of some sort, but nothing like today! So you were basically in it for the entire time!!!

Both actors are gifted comedically and convincingly portrayed a Jewish somewhat ""meddling"" mom, and her believable henpecked self doubting son. Great story about relationship, about love, respect, and the roles family play in the lives of each other. Here is a mother and a son, each trying her and his best to support the other's dream; not always in the way most appreciated by the other. But their hearts were always in the right places. This is a very sweet (maybe a bit too sugary for some) story, touching this viewer's heart at all the right moments. Even with the mother's penchant for off color audio books, this movie is funny, benign, and Il recommend it as a pleasant way to pass a little time, especially to those mothers who've raised their kids, and still enjoy some level of relationship with them. While I did not watch with mine, I'd say this would be an opportune movie to watch with your adult kids.",1410220800,,954,4.617647058823529

I think we can all relate to feeling embarrassed by your mom at times but know you love her with all of your heart.

It really captured just how irritating moms can be through the perspective of a son, but then really shows you as to why you're mom is always so concerned with EVERYTHING about you. It shows a different side of moms and makes you appreciate the one you have and maybe, if we take the time to get to really know our parents, we might understand them more. With that said, it really sends the message that no matter who or what your mother is, she deserves respect. Barbara Streisand is an adorable person as is Seth Rogan, them two together just creates a wonderful and real life like mother-son relationship. Also, really very cute story.

M&M's, Outback Steakhouse, Budget, KMart, Home Shopping Network, Costco, Fiji water, and GAP are just a few of the companies in the film. And the reading of the Cattlemens menu twice in the span of less than three minutes? They have no shame.

5136972,2,B0087ITBT8,"Seth Rogen is not believable as a sales person. At the beginning of the film the they go out their way to show us the very expensive blazer, but then the rest of his outfit looks as though he brought it off the clearance rack at Marshalls. He also never shaved before going to sell his product. In the beginning of the film, you see Rogen's character ignoring his mother's phone calls and not calling her back in which we never find out why. In the movie, the mother even asks, but he never answers. The part with the mother telling her son that she had never been in love with his father and only married him, because the other guy told her to didn't make sense and felt thrown in. The film was supposed to be about finding Streisand character's true love, but we don't see this until the last 12 minutes of the film. Most of the film was just Rogen's character selling a product that would not work (clean) in real life. The product was a so-called organic cleaning product that had soy sauce in it (really soy sauce). What part of soy sauce is organic? And apparently the Home Shopping Network just agrees to sell products without seeing if they work.
The only funny part of the movie is when Seth's character is making fun of the so-call cowboy's pick up line. I also find a hard time believing that her son would take her to meet this guy after telling him, she didn't really love his father and after he totally ignored all her phone calls at the beginning of the movie. And what did the mother do for a living? I mean she's always calling her son and  had nothing better to do but ride along on this trip (because she didn't know it was for her) to watch her son sell s***** products. I kind of like the ending with the exception of the mother asking the son if he asked about her. Even the actor portraying the son was looking like what when his character answered the question. I liked the fact that it was not a Hollywood ending where this guy was waiting for her after like 15 plus years, he actually had a family. They didn't have to kill the guy to make her call the cowboy. I also liked the fact that the mother finally decided to start living again.
Can you say too much product placement in this movie?",1408665600,,2218,4.268408551068884

5137183,4,B0087ITBT8,"Very funny, albeit predictable ""road movie"" that showcases some wonderful chemistry between Rogan and Streisand.  Some great gags and lines, priceless reaction shots, and a borderline believable premise has Rogan setting out on a last ditch sales trip with his prototypical ""Jewish mother"" tagging along and listening to R-rated talking books in the process.  The Guilt Trip does an admirable job of balancing the main road movie premise with events that unfold along the trip (strange hitchhikers, strippers, drunks, rich meat eating cowboys, failed product pitches).

The core of The Guilt Trip is a sweetness of tone, with both characters equally at each others' throats, then taking a deep breath and realizing that familial love is stronger than transient pain.  The moments of revelation between the two seem genuine and unforced, and in some case almost ad-libbed.

Streisand's ""Joyce"" occasionally becomes cartoonish and mannered, and Rogan plays the same character he's played in a dozen films- with a few welcome, subtle shadings.  He shows some promise of having the ability to ""underact"" if necessary.

A funny and endearing mother-son movie.",1405641600,,1154,5.377777777777778

Altogether, the movie really brings these two characters to life, and Rogen and Streisand do the plot beautiful justice.

  I loved this film. It surprisingly had wayyyy more laughs than I anticipated. Barbara and Seth have real life chemistry that takes you out of acting into some dynamic as if they really were mother/ son. The whole flow, feeling, and mood of the film is very smooth and an insipirational and feel good impact. I commend the goodhearted, wholesome message this flick inspires making us want to love our family more and better, while at the same time appreciating the time we have had and still have with our loved ones while we still have them. I love these types of films that make you overall just want to go hug your mother :). Good job and well done guilt trip.

5137436,3,B0087ITBT8,I could relate to this if my mother and I took a trip together. I loved it. It is a good movie to watch.  Streisand and Rogens chemistry is great.,1402012800,,146,3.8666666666666667
5137437,3,B0087ITBT8,"This is a cute, funny (but not hilarious) movie.  Streisand plays a great doting mother.  Seth Rogen plays the same character he always plays.  It's worth a look.",1402012800,,162,4.714285714285714
5137438,3,B0087ITBT8,"I enjoyed this movie. It had a few moments that were a little slow or contrived but I found myself laughing out loud in many places and really enjoyed BS's character. I'd recommend this movie for a light, entertaining, funny movie.",1402012800,,231,4.658536585365853
5137439,3,B0087ITBT8,"Lighthearted flick but quite hokey.  I always like Barbra Streisand and she's good in comedies, but I still found this film not worthy of more than 3 stars.",1402012800,,156,4.571428571428571
5137440,5,B0087ITBT8,I enjoyed the  Guilt Trip movie.  Guilt Trip was both funny and tender. I would recommend others to watch Guilt Trip.,1401926400,,117,4.523809523809524
5137441,2,B0087ITBT8,"This was an ""ok"" movie but I'm glad it was free to watch as I would have been upset to pay theatre prices to see it.  Had a few funny moments and the ending was ok but nothing really special about this movie.",1401926400,,208,3.8372093023255816
5137442,4,B0087ITBT8,Not quite as funny as his other movies but over all my husband and I liked it we laughed and laughed so I would watch it again and recommend a watch to a friend.,1401926400,,161,3.764705882352941
5137443,3,B0087ITBT8,I love Barbra- she is always good. But I didn't think the chemistry between her and her co-star was quite a match. Not quite as hilarious as made out to be.,1401926400,,156,4.064516129032258
5137444,5,B0087ITBT8,"It was hilarious. The relationship between mom and son, so real... I really enjoyed it. I'm glad this was on the prime list!",1401926400,,124,4.434782608695652
5137445,2,B0087ITBT8,Movie wasn't that funny and I thought Seth didn't play a good role here.i think there should have been a third star starring in the movie.and maybe it would not have been so bland.,1401926400,,180,4.323529411764706
5137446,5,B0087ITBT8,Great movie! Had me laughing and crying tears of joy! Will def watch this movie over and over again! :-),1401926400,,104,4.25

Very Funny & Accurate!",1401926400,,114,4.181818181818182
5137448,4,B0087ITBT8,Wasn't sure what to expect but it ended up being a pretty good movie. Streisand was actually funny and played the mom character to a tee.,1401840000,,137,4.3076923076923075
5137449,1,B0087ITBT8,"First things - The movie was great. Some people think the first half is boring or slow, and that is somewhat true, but this is not an action movie. I was pleasantly surprised that this Seth Rogen movie wasn't bad at all. My 1 star rating is for the piss-poor copy protection - which STOPPED ME FROM WATCHING ON A REGULAR DVD PLAYER! Yes, the DVD case even says ""This DVD is copy protected""

Here was my basic experience:
Hmm, available used - like new. DVD arrived a few days later in the mail. Pop it out of the case to examine for scratches/smudges - looks pristine. Turn on TV, put the DVD in the player. Hmmm. Nothing happening? What the? Pop disc out and clean with rubbing alcohol and a cotton ball, despite having no smudges or scratches. Put it back in the DVD player - no luck. Pop it out and try it on my computer instead; computer sees the file structure, so tried to watch it. Nope - crashed the video player. Tried another computer. Nope, no luck there either. Attempt to copy folder to hard disk - error. Hmmm.

Fire up software to remove copy protection, then copy to hard disk. Works like a charm! Convert to MP4 file, connect computer to TV, and watch the MP4 on full-screen TV. FINALLY.  What a waste of copy protection. Why sell a DVD that I can't even play in a regular DVD player?  So again, as I stare at the back of the DVD case at the words ""This DVD is copy protected"", I am struck by the irony: forced to make a copy to watch it.

In the end what did this gain Paramount? A pissed off customer who had to resort to breaking copy protection. I wonder, would this DVD play on ANY DVD player?

Again, this was an excellent movie, so don't be put off by the 1 star rating. Instead, consider buying it in a format other than DVD.",1401840000,3,1750,4.208955223880597

5137452,4,B0087ITBT8,It was way better than I had anticipated. Was surprised to see these two actors together but it worked. They meshed well together.,1401840000,,130,4.695652173913044
5137453,3,B0087ITBT8,I enjoyed this movie because I love both of the main characters.  There were funny moments and some scenes that we all can relate to.  I would recommend it for when you need a good laugh and don't want to do a lot of deep thinking.,1401753600,2,231,4.0
5137454,4,B0087ITBT8,"LOL!! Yep, all of those and some more.  This is a great piece of FLUFF that is definitely worth the watch. I love this movie. Don't have to think and see myself with my baby boy and our conversations that go to places that neither thought they would.  Don't pass this one up Moms.  Even if you baby boy is still a baby, you can see what you have to look forward to.",1401753600,,365,3.9726027397260273

5137457,1,B0087ITBT8,This movie not only starts out very slow but seems to be very lacking of humor. I thought Seth Rogan and Barbara Streisand would make a great team in this film but the chemistry was not there.,1401753600,,192,4.216216216216216
5137458,3,B0087ITBT8,OK movie. I didn't see a lot of chemistry between the actors. It seemed like it took time for the plot to get rolling.,1401753600,,118,3.9583333333333335
5137459,4,B0087ITBT8,Very cute and entertaining! Seth and Barbara are great together and it is a very sweet story. Worth a watch,1401753600,,107,4.4
5137460,4,B0087ITBT8,I really loved the ending when they meet the original Andy's children. It was really a great moment in the story. Also Seth was great when he presented his product to the HSN.,1401753600,,175,4.333333333333333
5137461,5,B0087ITBT8,This was a really good movie!  I was not expecting the ending it had but it totally made the whole movie.  Of course Barbra Streisand is fantastic in anything she does.,1401753600,,168,4.387096774193548
5137462,5,B0087ITBT8,Very funny and entertaining. It is a great movie to watch for relaxation. I would definitely recommend it if you want to watch a funny movie.,1401753600,,141,4.461538461538462
5137463,4,B0087ITBT8,Good movie for comedy night. We watched it with four adults and all enjoyed it. It was good to see Streisand in a good comedy again.,1401753600,,132,4.115384615384615
5137464,5,B0087ITBT8,This was a light-hearted and amusing movie. Any mother or son will appreciate the humor. Would definitely recommend. Two thumbs up.,1401753600,,131,5.285714285714286

5137466,3,B0087ITBT8,"Sure the bar was set rather low, I'm not too big a fan of most comedies these days and neither of the two lead actors would make my 'top 100 actors I'm in anyway entertained by' list. However the script was rather solid and I felt a connection to the material given my often contentious relationship with my mother. I even was willing to watch the movie a second time WITH my mother so that certainly means high praise from me.",1401753600,,427,4.283950617283951
5137467,4,B0087ITBT8,"Nice mother-son relationship story.  Nothing heavy, a bit predictable, but entertaining.  The subtle changes in the relationship are portrayed beautifully by Barbra and Seth.",1401667200,,174,6.208333333333333
5137468,3,B0087ITBT8,Cute movie with predictable script. Glad that we rented versus see it at the theater. Rogan and Streisand were good together.,1401667200,,125,5.0
5137469,4,B0087ITBT8,This is one of those movies you see a preview for but think it might not be worth it to pay for movie tickets to see at the theater.  TRUE.  It is worth it to watch for free with Amazon Prime.  I watched it one rainy day.  It wasn't the greatest movie I have seen but I did not feel like it was a waste of time when the movie was over.  Totally worth the watch if you have the time.,1401667200,,382,3.6666666666666665
5137470,4,B0087ITBT8,Barbra Streisand is an absolute hoot! It's funny and has plenty of emotional parts. It makes you think about the importance of family.,1401667200,,134,4.869565217391305

But not as funny as the previews and reviews make it out to be.  I guess we just expected more out of the duo.  The writing/story suffered.  These guys did the best they could with what script they had.",1401667200,,324,4.112903225806452
5137473,3,B0087ITBT8,Barbara Streisand is like butter.  This movie was okay.  It was slow at times but had an overall nice heartwarming story.,1401580800,,121,4.714285714285714

5137476,3,B0087ITBT8,"I have loved every movie Seth Rogan has been in.  My favorite was Pineapple Express, just a plain funny movie and he did an amazing job pulling off his character, to me, even with some of the serious content of it, it was non-stop laughs.  In Guilt Trip, I seriously could take it or leave it and had to force out a few laughs just to feel like I didn't waste my time.  His character wasn't funny and to me, he didn't quite pull off the guilt-ridden son in some of the scenes.  The same with Barbara Streisand.  We have seen countless television shows and movies about the typical guilt Jewish mother who guilts her children into everything, I just didn't see there here.  Of course, that may be why the producers and directors did that, so as not to make it a typical Jewish mother/guilt ridden child movie - but I think they could have done this a little better with these two funny actors.",1401580800,,892,4.343373493975903

5137480,2,B0087ITBT8,This was a very boring movie  I expected more given the cast.  I quit watching about half way thru. I really like Barbara Streisand but this was poorly acted,1401580800,,157,4.379310344827586
5137481,5,B0087ITBT8,"Barbara Streisand at her best.  I felt like I was watching real people.  I especially loved it when she'd finally had enough and walked out on the boy.  He should have listened to ""mom"" all along.",1401580800,,196,4.388888888888889

5137483,5,B0087ITBT8,"For me, as a mother of young sons, this was a heartwarming and true-to-life story. Sure it's slow in parts, but that's for a reason. I loved it and thought both Rogen and Streisand were perfect in their roles.",1401408000,,209,4.384615384615385

5137488,1,B0087ITBT8,"The fact that ""HILARIOUS"" is on the cover of this awful movie but then no critic -- or even a blogger -- was cited is fairly telling.

No clue how Seth Rogen keeps getting work, he's as unfunny as Lena Dunham in a house of mirrors. Still pretty sure both are famous as some horrible retribution from Judd Apatow, but anyway this movie is not ""HILARIOUS"" and is middling and boring at best.",1401408000,,389,4.328767123287672

What a fun and entertaining adventure this was.  Barbara and Seth took me on a wonderful trip, right from my couch.  The places they visited during their adventures were beautiful and exciting.

5137548,3,B0087ITBT8,"I thought this would be more of a ""crazy things happen on the road"" comedy, but it was not. What it was, was an exploration of a mother/adult child relationship that is quite relatable, and therefore funny in it's own right.  Barbra Steisand completely nails the doting, slightly overbearing mother, without overdoing it and Seth Rogan does a good job of portraying all of us who try to bite our tongues around our parents, but sometimes fail.",1400544000,,443,4.753246753246753

5137552,4,B0087ITBT8,"Seth Rogan gives a grown-up (almost) performance as a whiny chemist who develops a new, environmentally-safe cleaner.  And true to the stereotype (all science, no salesmanship), he has no skills to sell the product.  Barbara Streisand is his somewhat overbearing mother who joins him on his road trip as he attempts to make the ""big sale"" to companies like Costco.  It's predictable, but endearing fun, with a feel-good surprise at the end.",1400544000,,440,5.083333333333333

5137557,5,B0087ITBT8,"Ok, I'm a Streisand fan, and she doesn't even sing in this one.  This is just a fun movie.  I don't think it's ""hilarious"" but it's enjoyable.  A stripper that can fix a car?  Awesome.  That's how the movie goes.  The characters stop just short of annoying for me although I can see them annoying a lot of other people.  The performances get a bit clumsy here and there, less so for Streisand, but that's mostly the writing I think.",1400371200,,432,4.325

The movie was entirely predictable but heartwarming at the end. I think Barbra would have directed it more imaginatively but just my opinion. If you love Barbra, you'll enjoy seeing her in a different type of role. If you don't, skip it.",1400198400,,350,4.571428571428571

5137565,5,B0087ITBT8,I chose a 5 star because the movie could reach many age groups.  I love how funny it was but yet serious as well.  This was a very meaningful movie for me as a mother having grown men that I raise.  I like to this that my own boys will be there for me as I get older. Great movie to watch more than once.,1400198400,,304,3.646153846153846

5137609,4,B0087ITBT8,Streisand and Rogen are wonderful. She is funny throughout and he gets more humorous and believable as the movie progresses. Also an amusing commentary on the academic and economic plight of parents and their 30-something-year-old-children.,1399593600,,240,5.885714285714286

I love the way their journey woke up the woman in Barbara Streisand's character and gave her passion to open up her world to more adventures without her son.

In case there is even one other person out there besides me who would rather have her eyes gouged out than watch Barbra Streisand in a movie, and rather have her ears gouged out than listen to Barbra Streisand sing, and just plain could completely live without Barbara Streisand, take a chance here because surprisingly enough she's okay and will not annoy the stuffing out of you.  Seth Rogen carries the day and Barbra kept it low key and believable.  I liked it, thought it was cute, laughed out loud a few times.....what can I say: I have grown sons.",1399420800,,623,4.344827586206897

5137658,5,B0087ITBT8,"A delightful film of a mothers loving and poignant relationship with her son.  An endearing depiction of a parents anxiety, regret, longing, and hopefulness that they did something right and good for their child(ren).  Likewise the desire to feel loved and respected.  In this film Joyce (Streisand) come to realize this through an unexpressed love and sincerity her son Andy (Rogen) has for her, in the events and conversations they have on their road trip together.
The underlying charm of this story begins in a confession Joyce makes to Andy, of a secret romance before she married his father.  The man she loved enough to give Andy his name (Andrew).  Now curious in discovering this mysterious side of his mother, Andy plans his business road trip to include her, with their last stop being a visit with her old flame.  Disheartened, they are met with his surviving son, only to their surprise and delight, they meet his daughter who also bears the name JOYCE!
With self-gratification and validation of a son's love and of her first love, Joyce now feels free to live her life which no longer beckons her with the need to call her Andy for every-little-thing.

5137697,5,B0087ITBT8,"Funny movie! Mothers of sons in particular will like this, but so will anyone who has had a mother who sometimes made them a little crazy.

Seth Rogen's character develops into a very endearing fellow as the story unfolds, and Barbra Streisand is warmly neurotic.

And the further you go into the movie, say after the first twenty minutes, it's so believable that you are completely sucked into the story.  Wow.  I'd watch this again, no problem.  The writing of this is exceptional.  I wish there was a way to give this more than five stars.  Big props, too, for making a film adults would like that doesn't have violence, hate crimes, incestuous relationships, etc and instead relies on exceptional writing and acting to captivate the audience.  I couldn't stop watching.  And the last 10 minutes will make your heart sing.  Amazing.",1398470400,,662,4.678260869565217

I like Barbra Streisand and chose the movie because I heard great reviews and she was starring in it.  Being recently retired, less then 3 years, I was in the 'right place' for watching it.

This was my first Prime time movie experience and after a little online chat help, thoroughly enjoyed the experience.",1398211200,2,514,4.565217391304348

5137745,4,B0087ITBT8,Great movie and true to life.  A lot of real mother-child relationships are just like the one Streisand and Rogen had in this movie.  Real life alot of times is some of the best comedy there is.  Found myself thinking I can relate to some the situations in the movie and as normally is usual the parent tends to be right.  Great jobs by both Streisand and Rogen in the characters they portrayed.,1398038400,3,395,4.36986301369863

5137783,4,B0087ITBT8,"Do you know that mom that is WAY too overprotective of her children, even long after they have left the nest? Perhaps the child moved far away in order to stop the babying from happening.

That is the basic setup for this movie. Andy (Seth Rogen) is traveling across the country trying to convince large retail companies to stock his product on their shelves. Before heading out on his big adventure, he decides to stop by his mom's house when he finds out about a secret love she had many years ago. He decides to set up a reunion between the two of them at the end of his trip, but that means taking his mother along with him.

They stop in many cities and experience a variety of situations. Some of these include visiting a strip club (extremely awkward), gambling all night in Vegas, and eating a gigantic meal in under an hour at a hole in the wall restaurant. The last part reminded me of ""The Great Outdoors"" with John Candy replaced with little Barbara Streisand.

This is one of the better Seth Rogen films I've watched, probably because his swearing is kept in check (maybe he wasn't given free reign to ad lib). It was a good movie to watch once, but I don't think I would watch it a second time unless there was nothing else available.",1397606400,,1248,4.393939393939394

I expected a lot more from barb. Had some fun/ touching moments but I just had much higher expectations",1397606400,,112,4.6
5137786,5,B0087ITBT8,i rate this movie a five star because if you want something that will make you feel good and put a smile on your face this is it. i won't say that it had me laugh alot but put a smile on my face. good movie to jsut sit down and relax to at night with your family.,1397606400,,263,3.5517241379310347

5137793,4,B0087ITBT8,Seth Rogen and Barbra Streisand have great chemistry. This film was much funnier then I thought it was going to be. It never takes it self too seriously and has good flow.,1397520000,,171,4.375
5137794,3,B0087ITBT8,It was ok. I really don't think there was any chemistry between the two. I think Streisand did better in her other movies.,1397520000,,122,4.3478260869565215
5137795,4,B0087ITBT8,"Great comedy in my opinion. Kind of reminds me of type of relationship I have with my mother which might be why I thought it was so comical. My mom's married (sorry guys!) but if she weren't would I do the same thing that was done in this movie?  ...yeah, I totally would. Great movie to watch for Mother's day.",1397520000,,311,4.183333333333334

5137800,1,B0087ITBT8,Drags along and the stupidity of the son makes you mad and starts to snuff out any of the good acting done in this movie if any!

5137803,4,B0087ITBT8,"I'm giving this a four star rating...the only negative was because of the dispute between the two, other than that I liked the video very much.

5137804,1,B0087ITBT8,"no chemistry between the actors, first time i watched this alone and had to turn it off half an hour in because it is so boring and slow. second time a friend of mine wanted to watch it so we tried with a party of 4 to make it through, well we didn't even make it halfway. It is incredibly lame humor, it is dull, script is poor and barbara streisand although usually quite good was one big yawn in this movie. id give it 0 stars if i could.",1397347200,,441,3.911111111111111

5137809,2,B0087ITBT8,"Sometimes annoying, sometimes funny, this movie seemed like it was ready to go somewhere a couple times, but like the characters, in just seemed to float along aimlessly and without end. Maybe that is what it was supposed to be like, but I found myself drifting off in sleep on several occasions.",1397347200,,296,4.711538461538462

5137814,4,B0087ITBT8,Love Barbara Streisand and Seth Rogen is always funny. It's nice to see a movie that shows trials and tribulations of a mother-son relationship that doesn't take itself to seriously.,1397260800,,182,5.1

5137824,5,B0087ITBT8,"I love Barbara Streisand!. Love her as a singer, love her as an actress. She is one of those people that are unique and unforgettable.

When her adult son sets out on a big road trip to 'try to sell'' his newly invented product to company clients and at trade fairs, he mistakenly lets himself get talked into taking along Mom. Barbara Streisand plays a great slightly zany, but loving Mom who finds her 'great ideas' to help her son may have some very unexpected results. A very good movie for anyone who has run into issues with their parents and visa versa. Has a mix of funny and heartwarming scenes!",1397088000,,517,4.395833333333333

5137830,4,B0087ITBT8,A real surprise !  This is the kind of rare gem you love to luck up on on a rainy Sunday afternoon. Streisand and Rogan have great chemistry and run the hammer of emotions between a mother and a son. The comedic timing was perfect bit it was so much more. I loved the journey from start to finish!,1397001600,,297,4.033898305084746

5137834,5,B0087ITBT8,excellent movie i will recommend it to friends and family.  The selection of films available is huge and very easy to go around.  Fire TV is like having the cinema at home.,1397001600,,172,4.34375

Her earlier comedies like What's Up, Doc?, Hello Dolly!, For Pete's Sake, were very entertaining, and in my opinion, established Barbra as a very successful comedic actress. Guilt Trip, not as much. I thought her co-star, Seth Rogen carried most of the movie, with his genuine way of expressing frustration in less than perfect scenarios, like a great comedic actor should. Don't misunderstand, I still feel that Barbra still has great screen presence, and she still looks great. But, I give this movie to Rogen.",1396828800,,623,5.178217821782178

5137871,3,B0087ITBT8,OK if you like Rogen and Streisand. His dumb chuckle gets annoying after a while. Good diversion from day to day stresses.,1396742400,,122,4.590909090909091
5137872,5,B0087ITBT8,This movie made me laugh and cry at the same time.  It greatly portrayed the relationship between a mother and her songetting their lives together while on a road trip!!! Thank you,1396656000,,180,4.625
5137873,4,B0087ITBT8,"Guilt trip was a good movie. I would not say it was fantastic, but it was a entertaining movie. 4 stars",1396656000,,103,3.9523809523809526

5137875,3,B0087ITBT8,More than a slow in places.  Seth can be funny in a childish way.  Barbara is wonderfully underused.  This movie is a weak three.,1396656000,,129,4.291666666666667
5137876,4,B0087ITBT8,We liked how true to life the movie was.  It depicted the mother-son relationship and all the emotional ups and downs.,1396656000,,118,4.619047619047619
5137877,3,B0087ITBT8,I didn't think it was halaious but I give it three stars because it was a nice story although I was disappointed in the ending.,1396656000,,127,4.12
5137878,1,B0087ITBT8,"I don't know if this is good or not because the video stopped and started and restarted on it's own so I never got to see the movie.
this is the first movie I have watched thru Prime and I am not impressed.  I don't know if the service is faulty or the video is bad.

5137879,4,B0087ITBT8,"I didn't have high expectations for this movie going in, but I enjoyed it a lot. There were lots of funny moments and it was fun to see Barbara Streisand be funny again (more like Meet the Fockers funny). It's not a movie that will change your life, but it's a good light movie to watch.",1396569600,,287,4.142857142857143
5137880,4,B0087ITBT8,Great movie.  I happened to watch it with my mother and my teenager and we all liked it. Enjoy it.,1396569600,,98,3.9
5137881,3,B0087ITBT8,"Characters were excellent.  Storyline had great potential...but the writers only taped the surface of what could have been a good movie.
I'm glad I didn't pay $13.00  to see it at  the theater.",1396569600,,193,4.787878787878788
5137882,1,B0087ITBT8,I started this movie it wouldn't stream properly and it was boring from the beginning.  I watched about fifteen minutes and it did not interest me at all.  So maybe being unfair since I didn't watch the whole movie.,1396569600,,215,4.487179487179487

5137884,4,B0087ITBT8,"Barbara is still appealing and very funny.  Rogen is funny too.  The story line is fairly simple, but the mood is lighthearted and entertaining,  I better be careful how much I harp on my grown boys!",1396483200,,199,4.472222222222222
5137885,4,B0087ITBT8,it was slow at times but over all a good movie .... Barbra is not know for her acting but did a goood job,1396483200,,105,3.4166666666666665
5137886,3,B0087ITBT8,"Great movie (aprox. 1-1/2 hrs) to watch while car is being serviced.  Story of ""what might have been"" was surprisingly moving.",1396483200,,126,5.0

5137891,3,B0087ITBT8,Guilt Trip was Ok. Nothing I would watch again or even recommend. Barbara Streisand played a very stereotypical Jewish mother. She looked good. I was surprised. I guess she's had some work done like most  Hollywood types but IMO she looked natural. Good job Babs!,1396483200,,263,4.844444444444444
5137892,2,B0087ITBT8,This was a little funny but mostly boring.  Occasionally funny moments but mostly it was just really slow and just didn't hold my interest.  The overbearing mom was just a little over the top and his character is played like a spoiled brat in a grown man's body but that isn't really the funny part of the movie because he just comes across as a jerk.,1396483200,,351,4.303030303030303

5137897,5,B0087ITBT8,After watching this movie as a mother I can relate. Some of the things that she does is so classic of parenting. As parents sometimes we forget our children have  grown up. But yet they need our help sometimes it was it a great movie for any parent to watch,1396396800,,257,4.14

5137902,4,B0087ITBT8,This was a pretty funny movie. Barbra Streisand played a hilarious role. Great movie to watch when you're inside on a rainy day.,1396396800,,128,4.608695652173913
5137903,3,B0087ITBT8,"It was OK. Barbara Striesand was good, but it just wasn't exciting.  It isn't one that I would watch again.",1396310400,,107,4.35
5137904,2,B0087ITBT8,Was not impressed.  Thought that the movie would be funnier.  I thought it was really slow.  It put me to sleep,1396310400,,111,4.190476190476191
5137905,4,B0087ITBT8,"Excellent story, proving how important it is to re-examine our family relationships.  We are also reminded to think of & listen to others, not just ourselves; because many times they are just far enough away from the subject matter to give a fresh perspective.  We are also reminded that a sincere hug & the simple words, ""I love you"", are SO important for others, especially family members, to hear.",1396310400,,400,4.782608695652174

5137908,5,B0087ITBT8,Sometimes you just need to laugh. You will love this movie. We laughed all the way till the end. The acting was amazing and you will not be disappointed!,1396310400,,153,4.310344827586207
5137909,5,B0087ITBT8,This movie always makes me laugh. I have seen it with each of my children and love every scene. Each one of them can relate to a scene from it that reminds them of our life.,1396310400,,173,3.8333333333333335
5137910,4,B0087ITBT8,It was very sweet and extremely funny at times. It made me laugh out loud and appreciate my mom! A must see when you miss your mom and wish you were still a kid.,1396310400,,161,3.764705882352941

5137912,4,B0087ITBT8,I watched this movie after we got our Roku and I wanted to try out the Amazon app on it.  The movie was actually a funny movie and makes me look like a better mom since I don't nag that much.  I would watch it again with my kids so they could see that.,1396224000,,252,3.6481481481481484

5137914,5,B0087ITBT8,funny and entertaining and worth wacthing.  I love the stars Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen.  They were a good match.,1396224000,,118,4.85
5137915,4,B0087ITBT8,"Watched this movie while performing a tedious task; it made the task much more palatable. Guilt Trip is a cute movie although at times the gag of 'overbearing mom/fed up son' was much too obvious and therefore made the movie drag in places.

Despite the few slow moments this is definitely worth watching; perhaps even more than once.",1396224000,,334,4.758620689655173
5137916,3,B0087ITBT8,Cute son mom story.  Funny at times.  More of a serious character for Seth Rogen.  Not one of his better movies.,1396224000,,112,4.238095238095238

5137920,3,B0087ITBT8,"You could see frequently issues between moms and sons. Sometimes they're essier to work out as shown in this movie in a funny way, I would give them 3.5 stars, it just didn't let me do it. Enjoy it!!!",1396137600,,200,4.153846153846154
5137921,5,B0087ITBT8,"Excellent development of the parent personality and the grown child personality.  Created a story about the perceptions that the growing up and developing child has of the parent and of himself, both true and false. As the story line developed I could relate to both the child and the parent, probably because I have lived both experiences.  I loved the way the story ended but also could see the story continuing, just like in real life.",1396137600,,438,4.75

5137925,5,B0087ITBT8,"My husband and I both enjoyed this movie very much.  Unlike many others that you see today it wasn't filled with sex, drugs and violence.  There were a few scenes with some bad language but for the most part it was a really uplifting, ""feel good"" kind of movie.  It started out a little slow but got better as it went on.  Probably more for the Baby Boomer generation as I think we can relate to it better.",1396051200,,406,4.166666666666667

5137938,3,B0087ITBT8,"We only watched this because Seth Rogan was in it and we ran out of new movies to watch. It was an OK move. It had its slow parts, but there were a couple of funny parts. There were also a couple of heart warming moments. I would call this more of a middle aged person comedy. Being in my 20s, I found much of this movie to be drawn out/boring and almost annoying, but could relate to the ""being annoyed by your parents"" concept at times. Overall, I give it 3-stars. I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it again or recommend it to others.. not in my age group anyways...",1395964800,,571,4.017543859649122

5137946,5,B0087ITBT8,"Barbra is amazing as always. Love her in this movie! Seth starts out quite the whiner, but actually grows up a little during the movie. Maybe that tells of his great acting ability, cause I wanted to smack him. Worth your time.",1395878400,,227,4.428571428571429

5137952,1,B0087ITBT8,BORING!  Cliche ridden excuse of a film based on tired sterotypes and no laughs the first twenty minutes we watched it.  Can't give any other description because we chose to watch something else instead.,1395792000,,203,4.9411764705882355
5137953,4,B0087ITBT8,"So like a lot of people I went into this movie questioning if it'll be anywhere near good. Turns out, it was indeed good. I think the problem with people who watch this movie, is that they expect it to be one of those buddy comedies when it's not. The comedy is slow paced yes, but it's focused on the relationship between a mother and son. You would need to have a good bond with your parent to really understand the comedy of this movie.",1395792000,,439,4.176470588235294

5137957,3,B0087ITBT8,"It reminded me of a road trip I took with my mother many years ago.  I always enjoy any mvie that Barbra Streisand makes.  It isn't going to win an Academy Award, but it was a pleasant movie to watch.  I can only imagine what a Jewish mother and son's dilemma would be, but this movie certainly seemed to fill the bill.",1395705600,,319,4.112903225806452

5137962,2,B0087ITBT8,"Was very slow from the start and I should have moved on to something else after the first 15 minutes, but thought I'd give it a chance. Was disappointed and had expected more from both actors. The ""comedy"" was sub par and barely got a chuckle if that, on very few occasions throughout the show. If you thinking of seeing this one because of either Streisand or Rogen, don't. The storyline is ok but I would pass on this one!!",1395705600,,425,4.325
5137963,5,B0087ITBT8,Loved this show.  Makes you realized how much mothers do actually love their children and how children love their mothers in their own way.,1395705600,,139,4.791666666666667
5137964,4,B0087ITBT8,"Good comedy

5137965,4,B0087ITBT8,"This is a very enjoyable and fun movie, don't expect an Oscar performance or prize winning award but is very entertaining.
The interaction between the characters is  believable and could be real in many cases, reminded me a lot of my mom.

5137966,1,B0087ITBT8,"The premise of the movie had the potential to be funny. Unfortunately I got bored with the labored approach to the mother/son relationship before it got funny. I have to admit I turned it off about half-way through, got tired of waiting.",1395705600,,237,4.666666666666667
5137967,2,B0087ITBT8,Too much whining to offset the cute parts.  Pretty predictable. Ending was cute but not unexpected.  Seeing once was enough,1395705600,,123,5.1
5137968,3,B0087ITBT8,Cute movie but got a little boring in parts but some parts did make me laugh. Ok to watch not my favorite,1395705600,,105,3.8181818181818183

5137971,5,B0087ITBT8,It was very funny and heartwarming.  Very relateable to those of us who have over bearing mothers like Streisand played.,1395705600,,120,5.0
5137972,5,B0087ITBT8,I chose the movie because I like Barbra Striesand and I wasn't disappointed. It was a light hearted fun movie.,1395705600,,110,4.55
5137973,2,B0087ITBT8,"Not my kind of humor and even if it was it would be disappointing because there was very little to work with, but their relationship was cute.",1395705600,,142,4.296296296296297

5137976,5,B0087ITBT8,Adorable! Barbara Streisand was so convincing as a mom.  Light and just fun to watch. I would watch this movie again.,1395705600,,117,4.571428571428571
5137977,3,B0087ITBT8,Light comedy. Jewish Mother theme. This is more a TV quality film. Worth watching but not worth Theater price.  Not her best effort.,1395705600,,132,4.739130434782608
5137978,4,B0087ITBT8,I liked it. Not too serious and it helped past the time while in the waiting room at the hospital.,1395705600,,98,3.95
5137979,2,B0087ITBT8,Not a good Seth Rogan movie started off way too slow.  I would pass on this movie unless you have time to waste.,1395705600,,112,3.869565217391304
5137980,4,B0087ITBT8,"If you're looking for a ""hilarious"" movie, as the cover implies, you'll not find it. However, it is a good movie. It's more about the Mom/Son relationship. We enjoyed it.",1395705600,,170,4.7
5137981,5,B0087ITBT8,It was clear and a great movie. The sound was perfect and it gave a desire to watch it again.,1395705600,,93,3.7
5137982,2,B0087ITBT8,Not as funny as it should have been.  Just a slow dragging movie.  But I've seen worse.  That is all.,1395705600,,101,3.95
5137983,2,B0087ITBT8,I was skeptical about this movie because it was the first Seth Rogen movie that I never heard of. I would pass on this movie unless there is nothing else available.,1395705600,,164,4.32258064516129
5137984,3,B0087ITBT8,"mother and son take a road trip together and she keeps fouling everything up and never stops talking, so if you can stand that, the movie is ok, but it'w better if you can relate to it, I think.",1395619200,,194,4.0

5137986,5,B0087ITBT8,I was looking for a movie to watch and this was a great movie. It was funny and enjoyable. Barbara Streisand was very good in this movie,1395532800,,136,4.074074074074074
5137987,4,B0087ITBT8,I thought this movie was witty and charming.  Just a cute fun watch! Entertaining and I loved Barbara in this role.,1395532800,,115,4.476190476190476
5137988,3,B0087ITBT8,"A few funny lines, but nothing really hilarious. The heart-warming ending made watching it worthwile.  I'd recommend this movie to mothers of adult children.  Don't make your husband sit through it.",1395532800,,198,5.354838709677419
5137989,1,B0087ITBT8,"I love Barbra Streisand but her character in this movie was irritating until the very end.  The story idea is okay, the movie could have been much better.",1395532800,,154,4.5
5137990,1,B0087ITBT8,"The hard part of a comedy with 2 characters is that if you don't like the chemistry you're out of luck. I've noticed a trend lately with these type of movies were one person is completely unlikeable. Barbara Streisand is that person in this movie. Not only is she entirely terrible at acting, she's so hammy is grating. The part as written is also a complete throwaway. Is anyone routing for her in this movie?  The locations are over the top, strip club, steakhouse etc. The lines are so weak you see them coming from far away.

Please avoid.",1395532800,,543,4.474747474747475
5137991,5,B0087ITBT8,Great movie to watch with family and friends. Hope you all enjoy it as much as I did. Get out the popcorn.,1395446400,,106,3.8636363636363638
5137992,4,B0087ITBT8,enjoyed the movie -- had trouble understanding Barbara Streisand at times but all in all enjoyed the movie.  Would recommend this movie,1395446400,,135,5.136363636363637

5137994,4,B0087ITBT8,Very entertaining...solid story line. Good movie. Barbra Streisand was great. Excellent chemistry between her and Seth Rogen as Mother and Son.,1395446400,,143,5.857142857142857

5137997,1,B0087ITBT8,This movie is essentially a road trip.  It has the new twist of Mother and Son going together.  Sort of annoying actually. I do not recommend this movie.,1395446400,,153,4.428571428571429
5137998,4,B0087ITBT8,Light-hearted and short. I am sure many a mother and son could relate to this movie. How could you not love Seth and Barbra!,1395446400,,124,4.208333333333333
5137999,2,B0087ITBT8,I felt this movie couldn't decide whether it was comedy or drama. There were so many missed opportunities for comedy and also for drama that it was difficult to stay interested in the main characters. These two performers could have done much better in their choice of roles.,1395360000,,275,4.75
5138000,4,B0087ITBT8,I thought it was a good movie and it exceeded my expectations.  The movie flowed well and didn't seem to drag.,1395360000,,110,4.238095238095238
5138001,3,B0087ITBT8,Decent but not the usual Seth Rogen type of movie. Light humor but overall a nice story with a meaning behind it.,1395360000,,113,4.181818181818182

5138004,5,B0087ITBT8,I love happy endings. Both of these actors exhibited perfectly the love a Jewish mother has for her only son. It was so entertaining.  And it didn't hurt getting to see the Texas influence.  (Being a Texan myself),1395360000,,213,4.578947368421052
5138005,3,B0087ITBT8,"Seth Rogan and Barbra Streisand actually make a great mother/son team. Cute movie.... Predictable, but still good. There were some sweet moments.",1395360000,,145,5.636363636363637

5138007,4,B0087ITBT8,"I love Seth Rogan and Barbra Streisand so really liked the movie.  They did a great job, very believable and glad that I watched it.  As a mother if 3 grown sons, thought about similarities in instances of being a daughter and a mother.  However, know it wouldn't appeal to my husband, as he prefers action movies.",1395273600,,314,4.473684210526316

5138009,2,B0087ITBT8,Tried to watch the movie but found it dull and pointless. I like both lead actors but the movie just dragged on. Could not finish watching it.,1395273600,,142,4.296296296296297
5138010,1,B0087ITBT8,"This movie was a huge disappointment.  The actors are great, but there is no chemistry between them.  The script is awful.  The comedy is completely absent.",1395273600,,156,4.923076923076923

5138015,1,B0087ITBT8,I was real glad I didn't have to pay for this movie because any price would be too much.  It was just a stupid movie....too bad cuz both stars have more potential than this.,1395273600,,173,4.088235294117647
5138016,3,B0087ITBT8,Good movie....great writing of relationship between a mother and son. Would tell others to go see this movie. Great casting.,1395273600,,124,5.25
5138017,1,B0087ITBT8,"Wasn't very funny, I kept asking myself why I am still watching this?  Only worth it if you like Rogen or Streisand",1395273600,,115,4.2272727272727275
5138018,2,B0087ITBT8,I found this to be kind of boring. Never actually laughed out loud even once. I would not recommend wasting your time.,1395187200,,118,4.409090909090909

5138023,4,B0087ITBT8,"Good family friendly movie, probably better for older children simply because younger ones probably wouldn't get it. Beyond the slapstick and grown kid guilt there are several underlying universal truths that get exposed. All that nerdy science/technology/academic nonsense that nerds, scientists, engineers and academics sometimes go on endlessly about...nobody else really cares. You meet the nicest people in the strangest places, and if you're selling something, keep it simple, stupid. Oh yeah, and your mom isn't as nuts as you think she is and kids aren't really as ungrateful as we appear to be and we always seem to have yell first to figure that out.",1395187200,,660,5.235849056603773

5138055,4,B0087ITBT8,Just like the road trip it represented this movie slowly delivered an entertaining look at why you should trust your friends and family when they give you advice.,1395014400,,162,4.821428571428571
5138056,5,B0087ITBT8,"Streisand and Rogen are hilarious.  Streisand's role as the mother is too much, she does and says things that drives  her son crazy, but after he hears a touching story, he seems to understand her.  Rogen's role turns out to be your normal son that snaps when needed and then apologizes.  It's a pretty funny movie everyone should see - especially if you are an only child.",1395014400,,373,4.522388059701493

5138061,2,B0087ITBT8,"Seth Rogen can do better than this. Streisand can certainly do WAAAAYYYY better than this.
Predictable, formulaic, boring, terribly paced (it feels like nothing happens for hours), only 1 or 2 genuine laughs in the whole movie. Don't waste your time.",1394841600,2,250,5.121951219512195
5138062,4,B0087ITBT8,It was very realistic and true to life.  I could really relate to it.  It was also quite funny in parts and touching in many others.  I would recommend it to parents of older children and to their children themselves. A nice movie!,1394841600,,231,4.325581395348837

5138065,2,B0087ITBT8,It could have been better. Great cast but it dragged on to long. Thought they could have had a little more plot to the movie. Would not recommend to watch.,1394841600,,155,4.2
5138066,1,B0087ITBT8,It was just Not funny! Very slow! I fell asleep & woke up  & kept waiting to laugh! I did like the story line esp. When she found x had named daughter after her& I will always be a faithful Barbara fan! But I was very grateful that I did not have to pay for the movie! Thanks for liistening!,1394841600,,291,3.85

To see how much a mothers love can hurt or break a relationship. The road trip was a wonderful Idea; this way the both of them had an opportunity to see what each one thought about each other. I would go back and see this again..

5138073,4,B0087ITBT8,Well acted.  The story made some good points about mother son relationships without being too silly or over the top.,1394755200,,116,4.8
5138074,1,B0087ITBT8,This was a truly stupid show.  I doubt that I watched more than 15 minutes of it and had to turn it off.  Like Streisand all right but this was beneath her I would say.,1394755200,,168,3.7714285714285714

5138101,2,B0087ITBT8,"Very patheticly drawn out, boring movie. Rogen should stay with what he knows and is great at, comedy. Streisand must need money badly as this was not role for her. Overall there were a couple funny parts lasting perhaps 10 minutes. Waste of time and money.",1394582400,2,257,4.608695652173913

5138109,1,B0087ITBT8,"This movie is not hilarious. It is a serious movie about a mother-son relationship. About healing and getting to know your child and parent as adults. If it was touted as such, I would give this movie a higher rating but since this is advertised as a comedy, I think it's a total failure. False advertising in my opinion. If you want a heartfelt, relationship exploring movie that hits very close to real life situations, then this is the movie for you. For me, I have enough real in my life... I was looking for something a little more light hearted.",1394496000,,551,4.465346534653466

5138113,4,B0087ITBT8,"Funny, poignant, ""feel-good"".  Actors superb. Portrayal of Jewish mother follows the stereotype.  Can't add much beyond this. Don't think their needs to be a minimum unless you get too many responses.",1394409600,,200,5.419354838709677
5138114,3,B0087ITBT8,I like Seth Rogen and of course Babs is great so I thought I give the movie a go. It was funny like I thought it would be but I was also really sweet and heartwarming too. I really liked it.,1394409600,,190,3.658536585365854

5138125,4,B0087ITBT8,"I guess some reviewers need the slapstick, pratfalls type of comedy's....I loved this because it was so true to life.  Mom's never stop loving their kids no matter how old they get.  I loved that even though his mom drove him nuts, he was still respectful of her (to a degree in the beginning...even though he was quite snarky at first )  I appreciated it when he finally saw his mom as a person, not just a mom.",1394323200,,412,4.256410256410256
5138126,4,B0087ITBT8,"Good pace to plot, relateable to anyone that has / had (R.I.P. Mom) an over-helpful mom.  Seth Rogen was the typical Seth Rogen, but this was a believable role for him.  Streisand was perfect as everyone's mom.  Great movie!",1394323200,,224,4.6923076923076925

5138140,5,B0087ITBT8,Funny movie without all the slapstick stupidity.  Barbra Streisand is wonderfully humorous in this film. Seth Rogan is a perfect fit in this role.,1394236800,,146,5.083333333333333
5138141,4,B0087ITBT8,"Not an emotional tear jerker or the most thought provoking moving of the year; but a solid fun movie.  Funny, and both stars are great and have a good dynamic together.

5138144,5,B0087ITBT8,"I really enjoyed this movie. My youngest 21-year old son mocked me for watching it. ""Mom, how can you watch that?"" He did something else and I watched the rest of the movie and thoroughly loved it. As a mother of three grown men, it made me smile. Especially how they fought in the hotel room. That happens with mothers and sons, and then later they get over it and go on and are stronger together. Both characters are very believable and bring a smile on a mother's face. Not so sure they'll do anything to the sons...",1394150400,,519,4.3061224489795915
5138145,4,B0087ITBT8,"I enjoyed this movie, made me think of mother-son relationships and their ups and downs, but the bottom line is that unconditional love they share.",1394150400,,147,4.92
5138146,5,B0087ITBT8,Great movie. Loads of fun. Typical family friendly movie. Enjoyable to watch with the whole family. Babra is great to watch on screen.,1394150400,,134,4.869565217391305
5138147,3,B0087ITBT8,"This was good enough to watch, but not so good that I would ever watch a second time, or buy the DVD. I was expecting a better funnier film. Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood.",1394150400,2,179,3.864864864864865
5138148,4,B0087ITBT8,"A movie with annoying mother habits, but your heart wins out always. It's funny, quirky, and sweet, just what the doctor ordered",1394150400,,128,4.863636363636363
5138149,4,B0087ITBT8,"Nice to see a movie that didn't depend on lots of CGI!
Enjoyable light entertainment that relied on the human interest.
It is well worth an hour and a half of your time.",1394150400,,169,4.151515151515151
5138150,4,B0087ITBT8,Was a great movie to watch on a lazy day when you need a good laugh.  Seemed like a real mom and son relationship.,1394150400,,114,3.75

5138152,2,B0087ITBT8,It was okay bur glad i didn't pay to see it in theater. Story was bland nothing new. Good family movie.,1394150400,,103,3.9523809523809526
5138153,5,B0087ITBT8,"Its one of those movies with a great story line about everyday life, everyday relations, down to earth humor and simple. I never thought I could really enjoy a movie about a road trip with your mom and what happens when two people who don't really talk are put in a situation where they have to.",1394064000,,295,4.285714285714286
5138154,1,B0087ITBT8,Boring! I was not able to finish watching because this movie was so horribly boring. Streinsand has to feel embarrassed that she took part in this movie.,1394064000,4,153,4.703703703703703

5138157,4,B0087ITBT8,Who'd a thought Seth and Barbara would make such an entertaining match up.  And who knew Barbara was still such a tremendous actress and comic?  Well worth the watch for a heart warming story with lots of laughs.,1394064000,,212,4.552631578947368
5138158,5,B0087ITBT8,"I love Rogen. His stoner persona is always convincing and hilarious. Him being matched with Streisand who I detest as a person because of her hypocritical beliefs caught my attention. Ms. Streisand was so beautiful and sincere. The chemistry between the two was a pleasant surprise. I was mesmerized throughout the whole movie by Streisand's believability and her, (she must be 70), pure beauty and acting ability.",1394064000,,414,5.1940298507462686

5138160,4,B0087ITBT8,"Aside from the few emotional outbreaks of foul language, this movie is delightful. Barbara Streisand (the mother) plays the part perfectly like she always does. The bond between mother and adult son is strengthened by a spur of the moment road trip that the son decides to take, under false pretenses I might add, to reunite her with a old love. She thinks it is to spend time with her while promoting sales of his product. She likes to make suggestions while he hates her interfering. This sentiment is mutual. This movie is funny and ends on a happy note. I would rate it 4-1/2 stars if I could.",1394064000,,597,4.486238532110092
5138161,2,B0087ITBT8,It was a movie that would be good on a rainy day.  Can see why it didn't draw big crowds at the movies.,1394064000,,103,3.4782608695652173
5138162,4,B0087ITBT8,"These two actors complimented one another in this movie. The dialogue was great and so real between a mother and son.  For something light hearted, I would definitely recommend watching this.",1394064000,,191,5.161290322580645
5138163,2,B0087ITBT8,This movie wasn't quite as funny up front as I thought it might be.  Perhaps others would like it  very much.,1394064000,,109,4.142857142857143
5138164,3,B0087ITBT8,I thought the two main characters had good mom/son chemistry and the concept is kinda funny.  The end is touching too.  Its just not going to win any awards.,1394064000,2,157,4.379310344827586
5138165,5,B0087ITBT8,THIS MOVIES IS HALARIOUS!! SETH ROGAN & BARBRA STREISAND ARE A PERFECT PAIR!!!! EVERYONE MUST WATCH THIS MOVIE LIKE TODAY!,1394064000,,122,5.15

5138167,4,B0087ITBT8,"I was honestly just curious about this movie when I watched it.  It's quaint and expected as far as the storyline, but the chemistry between Seth Rogen and Barbra Streisand as mother and son was pretty good.  They had good timing and seemed to genuinely have interactions, which was apparent in the outtakes at the end.",1394064000,,319,4.678571428571429
5138168,5,B0087ITBT8,loved this movie. for me it seemed real and though billed as a comedy it really isn't. The relationship between mother and son was protrude beautifully in my opinion and Streisand was great in an underplayed role.,1394064000,,213,4.783783783783784
5138169,4,B0087ITBT8,"Streisand plays her part very well and keeps the movie entertaining and interesting.  It's a fun movie to kick back, relax, and enjoy.  Not fast paced and intense and not slow and dull.  Good movie.",1393977600,,198,4.6
5138170,2,B0087ITBT8,Ibarbara Streisand looks great in this movie. She's always funny. But the movie is boring. She looks fantastic. Would not recommend.,1393977600,,132,5.333333333333333
5138171,4,B0087ITBT8,I really laughed through the second half. Barbara Streisand is a very good comedic actress. This is definitely for a mither son.,1393977600,,128,4.863636363636363
5138172,5,B0087ITBT8,This movie makes me thankful I have a mother who loves me.  Will call her now to tell her I love her.,1393977600,,101,3.590909090909091
5138173,5,B0087ITBT8,It was a really funny family movie. I thought the relationship between the son and mother was great and I really enjoyed it,1393977600,,123,4.391304347826087
5138174,5,B0087ITBT8,This was a great movie especially if you are a mom with an adult son.  Definitely should have watched with my son.,1393977600,,114,4.181818181818182
5138175,4,B0087ITBT8,IT WAS FUNNY AND PROVES MOTHERS KNOW ALL.WATCH AND DECIDE FOR YOURSELVES.I HAD NEVER SEEN THE MALE BEFORE ON TV OR MOVIES BUT HE WORKED WELL WITH BARBRA.,1393977600,,153,4.5
5138176,4,B0087ITBT8,This was a cute movie that made me laugh at times. Not Oscar worthy but I truly enjoyed watching this movie.,1393977600,,108,4.190476190476191
5138177,4,B0087ITBT8,Little slow at beginning but got a lot better as it went on. I  really liked the end a lot.,1393977600,,91,3.55

5138180,4,B0087ITBT8,"No nudity, no foul language. We actually watched the whole movie. ""Hilarious"" may be an overstatement. The acting was good.",1393977600,,123,5.2
5138181,5,B0087ITBT8,Heartfelt. Loved it. Laughed throughout. I think most people can relate to several situations in this movie. Seth Rogan was fantastic.,1393977600,,134,5.428571428571429

5138183,5,B0087ITBT8,"Funny , real per-pose of closer bonding family they were a great team and came threw as better stronger people , we can all learn from that would see again.",1393977600,,156,4.233333333333333
5138184,5,B0087ITBT8,"So I finally got around to watching this movie. it really reminded me of the relationship I have with my mom (but don't we all have this relationship with our parents?!), and was laughing the entire time watching it. its a really good movie, showing love, compassion and honesty. I will say it did show how important communication and boundaries are with folks. but overall I enjoyed the movie entirely!!! ITS A MUST WATCH!!!",1393891200,,425,4.756756756756757
5138185,4,B0087ITBT8,"The movie started out as lame as any movie could be. It was very different yet predictable, Barbara  was great as always and made the movie fun to watch. Enjoy the acting of Barbara and let the story flow.",1393891200,,205,4.256410256410256
5138186,2,B0087ITBT8,Dull and very slow moving plot.  I gave up watching.  Bad plot to begin with and boring.  Yes it is,1393891200,,99,3.85
5138187,4,B0087ITBT8,"It was raining this last weekend outside was cold and wet. This was the perfect heartfelt, drink some hot cocoa, while you watch a movie that  was  funny,made you laugh. I am  glad I picked this to watch while I  stay in from the rain. A perfect  kind of movie for the weekend.",1393891200,,277,4.150943396226415
5138188,3,B0087ITBT8,"It was a cute movie about a mother/son relationship, but nothing special to 'write home about' it was rather predictable.",1393891200,,121,5.1
5138189,3,B0087ITBT8,"There were some funny moments in Guilt Trip, but overall I felt as if it dragged in a lot of places. I wouldn't call it ""Hilarious"" as it says on the cover..more like a couple of chuckles here and there.",1393891200,,203,4.1
5138190,4,B0087ITBT8,"Perhaps mirrors the way a lot of us feel in mother, grown up son relationships, both wanting to push the other into a romantic relationship with somebody else.  Mom wants to see her son ""succeed"" and start a family and son wants to give his mom something to be occupied with so she can stop hounding him.  Lots of hilarious situations.",1393891200,,335,4.475409836065574
5138191,5,B0087ITBT8,"I loved it. Of course I could relate. I'm 50+ and have three sons. I laughed and I cried.  I never really cared for Barbra Streisand, but she is awesome in this movie.",1393891200,,167,4.0606060606060606
5138192,5,B0087ITBT8,I laughed all the way through the movie! I appreciated that there were no bad words or lewd references. It was family friendly and hilarious!!!,1393891200,,143,4.76
5138193,4,B0087ITBT8,"While I wouldn't call this movie a comedic masterpiece, it was a sweet and amusing way to spend a couple hours of my life. The movie's light and though the writing isn't killer, it doesn't fall flat or drag awkwardly on. This was an altogether dependable flick; I'd recommend it.",1393891200,,279,4.6
5138194,4,B0087ITBT8,Funny easy going movie.. Realistic mother and son relationship. Movie about a mother who is proud of her son. Help each other out.,1393891200,,130,4.695652173913044
5138195,5,B0087ITBT8,Absolutely LOVED this movie and the reality of the relationship between mother and son!  Very surprised at the awesome acting by both Barbara Streisand and her opposite lead.  A must watch,1393891200,,188,5.032258064516129
5138196,3,B0087ITBT8,"Just an enjoyable movie with subtle humor (not hilarious) and a touching mother/son relationship.  I'm sure a lot of sons find their mothers very irritating at times, but the underlying deep love is always there.",1393891200,,212,5.057142857142857
5138197,4,B0087ITBT8,Great commedy but my take away was that your parents or (parent) are much wiser than we often think they are.,1393891200,,109,4.238095238095238
5138198,4,B0087ITBT8,"Lots of laughs, good way to spend the evening.  Would recommend this movie. First time watching Amazon Prime movie with Roku and it works great!",1393891200,,144,4.76
5138199,1,B0087ITBT8,"Jewish mom and son story a bit trite. Too predictable, too stereotypical, too boring. Seth Rogen took a step down from his normal funny roles and Barbra Streisand is past her prime as an actress.",1393891200,,195,4.6
5138200,4,B0087ITBT8,better than I expected. it's not over the top Hollywood stupid farce. the relationship between mother and son is genuine. it's not ROTFL but plenty of funny moment. the ending makes the whole journey worthwhile.,1393891200,,211,5.057142857142857
5138201,1,B0087ITBT8,The advertisement for this movie made it look better then it was.  I had planned on seeing it when it was at the theaters and glad I waited and saw it for free.  I would not see it again.,1393891200,,187,3.769230769230769
5138202,3,B0087ITBT8,Cute show ..It's Hollywood typical with a feel-good ending ...funny moments make you laugh and maybe cry. Something to watch on a rainy day,1393891200,,139,4.833333333333333
5138203,5,B0087ITBT8,Nothing like having your mom with you on your road trip to meet your dad...entertaining too say the least Mom in a topless bar...,1393891200,,129,4.416666666666667
5138204,4,B0087ITBT8,I thought it was a very good movie! Barbra Streisand was very funny! Great movie for a quite after noon.,1393891200,,104,4.25
5138205,3,B0087ITBT8,"Enjoyable though a little absurd at times. The basic premise that a woman looking as beautiful as Barbara Streisand would end up as an overprotective, guilt inducing never expanding her life beyond her son widow, (oh and who only had one other manin her life besides her dead husband) then you'll be fine with just sitting back and laughing. The story is cute and as could be predicted both characters develop and grow and come out making life happen instead of letting life swirl meaninglessly around them.",1393891200,,507,4.839080459770115

5138207,4,B0087ITBT8,A good comedy.  Hard to find these days. Barbara is as good as ever in this modern day version of many of her earlier movies.,1393891200,,125,4.0
5138208,4,B0087ITBT8,I love both Streisand and Rogen individually. I was pleasantly surprised they had screen chemistry as mom and son. I enjoyed it.,1393891200,,128,4.863636363636363
5138209,2,B0087ITBT8,The movie is not hilarious as it states. I believe I laughed one time on the whole movie. I would not recommend it.,1393891200,,115,4.043478260869565
5138210,5,B0087ITBT8,This movie was was so good.  This would have been my son and me on a trip LOL!!!!  Good for the heart!,1393891200,,102,3.590909090909091
5138211,5,B0087ITBT8,"Do you love Barbara Streisand, then get ready for a laugh. Has endearing moments as well but for the most part this is light entertainment.  Not the best BS has done but a good watch.",1393891200,,183,4.228571428571429
5138212,3,B0087ITBT8,Cute movie. Barbara Streisand and Seth Rogan were very good together and mother and son. As a mother I could relate.,1393891200,,116,4.571428571428571
5138213,4,B0087ITBT8,I loved the movie and I loved the actors!! Barbra should be in more movies. Was both funny and touching....the ending was perfect.,1393891200,,130,4.695652173913044

5138215,4,B0087ITBT8,Funny too close to home stint of mom and adult son.  For those of us who can relate it was quite entertaining.,1393804800,,110,4.0
5138216,1,B0087ITBT8,I didn't care for it.  I got bored with the storyline and turned it off before it ended.  I have enjoyed most of Barbra Streisand's movies but not this one.,1393804800,,156,4.166666666666667
5138217,5,B0087ITBT8,Fast moving and well done. Story has interesting ending. Filmed in some interesting places. Good cast. Hope Prime has more current movies coming.,1393804800,,145,5.3478260869565215

5138219,1,B0087ITBT8,"I started watching this and it was just painful to watch something this bad...I didn't stick with it all the way through simply because it was so predictable and not worth my time.  Sorry to be so negative, but this movie just didn't do a thing for me.",1393804800,,252,4.25
5138220,2,B0087ITBT8,BORING and I HATE bad language when it is not even necessary. I love Barbara Streisand but don't care for the other guy. She was a real looker in her earlier days. wish I could have seen the film she got her start from way back when. she is still beautiful for her age. I am 36 and still like her. beautiful woman you are Barbara.,1393804800,,330,4.015151515151516
5138221,3,B0087ITBT8,"There really isn't anything special about this movie. Seth Rogen and Barbara Striesend worked well together, although Striesend did get on my nerves after awhile. I don't think I laughed one time, but it was mildly entertaining.",1393804800,,228,5.1891891891891895
5138222,2,B0087ITBT8,light story no awards forthcoming but I would watch on a rainy day if had nothing better to do. The mother played by Barbara Streisand was just a little to naggy to be entertaining. YOu just wanted her to be quiet in the beginning of the movie. By the mid point she had a bit of character to go with the nagging which allowed you to get into the character a little. The son played by Seth Rogen was a little off as believable still he was likable enough  to put up with the story. All in all I watched it but never have to watch it again.,1393804800,,538,3.9814814814814814
5138223,3,B0087ITBT8,"I was expecting this to be loaded with humor and was disappointed that this did not happen.  The humor is really not funny, barely made me smile.  To the good side of this story - its a great movie to show how grown children can become very close and accepting to a parent.",1393804800,,273,4.132075471698113
5138224,4,B0087ITBT8,Amazing how much nagging a son will put up with from a loving mother.  His surprise for her was a delightful turn around.,1393804800,,121,4.260869565217392
5138225,1,B0087ITBT8,Pretty awful.  I lost intrest in the first fifteen minutes and even though i looked to like it.....i couldn't.  Very sad because I usually love these actors.,1393804800,,157,4.777777777777778

5138230,3,B0087ITBT8,Very entertaining for a rainy day or a lazy day. I like Seth Rogen movies this wasn't his best but it was different.,1393804800,,116,4.086956521739131
5138231,1,B0087ITBT8,The movie is about a road trip cross country--watching feels like you actually drove cross country with your mom... Preview contained all of the funny moments and left little for you to laugh about in the actual movie.,1393804800,,218,4.7631578947368425
5138232,1,B0087ITBT8,"this movie was a total bore, not funny, not witty, and a waste of time to watch.  Barbara Streisand looks good for a woman her age but her acting was not worth looking at.  I'm glad I didn't pay to watch this.",1393804800,,209,3.9523809523809526
5138233,5,B0087ITBT8,"They both were great! Great timing, great comedy and natural!  Hits close to home for me and tugged at my heart strings.  Relentless, throwing in her 2 cents mother to her I know it all son.  Eventually letting go and accepting each other! Full of plenty mama knows a thing or 2 so listen up and stop rolling your eyes moments.",1393718400,,327,4.327868852459017
5138234,4,B0087ITBT8,This was a heartfelt story.  It was also funny at the same time.  I like both star actors in the movie.,1393718400,,103,3.857142857142857
5138235,2,B0087ITBT8,"Some really funny moments but mostly pretty weak movie, the plot winds on and on with a guffaw here or there. It's like they had about four really funny skits and they found a bunch of filler to get it up to a movie. Waste of time mostly.",1393718400,,238,3.9791666666666665
5138236,5,B0087ITBT8,"This was a great feel-good movie, Barbara Streisand is an awesome entertainer (STILL). A movie about growing up... again :)",1393718400,,123,5.2

5138238,3,B0087ITBT8,Okay story line with great actors that made it worth watching. There were some funny scenes. Enjoyed enough to watch the whole movie.,1393718400,,133,4.826086956521739

5138240,4,B0087ITBT8,"It was an easy movie to watch, and be entertained by.  I wish the language was not so bad, and thus I would not recommend it for families.",1393718400,,138,3.9285714285714284
5138241,5,B0087ITBT8,"I enjoyed this movie. The exchange between Streisand and Rogen were wonderful and painfully familiar.

I should qualify that I worked on the movie and know that except for a few scene in Las Vegas, the entire movie was shot within a few hours drive of Streisand's Malibu home. The Grand Canyon was a dry rolling hill in Agua Dulce. The snow covered strip club was off the I-5 in Velencia in mid-summer.

I would have bought this even were I not in the credits.",1393718400,,460,4.4
5138242,4,B0087ITBT8,"Though a little slow at times (hence the 4 rating), I found this movie entertaining. It was able to make me laugh!",1393718400,,114,4.2272727272727275
5138243,4,B0087ITBT8,"This was a good movie. Funny and entertaining with some poignant moments. Others had said it was amazing, I wouldn't say that, but definitely worth while.",1393718400,,154,4.961538461538462
5138244,4,B0087ITBT8,While Barb's voice gets a little annoying at times...the story between mom and son is good. Son gave good come backs to mom's nagging.,1393718400,,134,4.625
5138245,5,B0087ITBT8,"I am a true Barbara Streisand fan!  I picked this simply because she was in it, not knowing that I would absolutely love everything about the film.  It is an amazing heart warming story about a son and mother who discover one another again, seeing one each other as an individual and rediscovering the love and genuine appreciation they have for one another despite the things that they do not like about each other (which turns out to be all the little petty things must of us dislike in parental/child relationships.  I laughed, I cried, and I was left feeling warm and happy.  Great film, great actors and great story.  Enjoy!!",1393632000,,630,4.63963963963964
5138246,3,B0087ITBT8,"I enjoyed the mother-son dialogue between Seth Rogan and Barbara Streisand (who was terrific with what she was given) but the plot became lame, and the serious parts - which weren't badl - were too serious for this kind of movie.",1393632000,,229,4.609756097560975
5138247,5,B0087ITBT8,If a Mother has a grown son she will love this movie. A lot of truth to this movie. Watch it.,1393632000,,93,3.4761904761904763

5138249,4,B0087ITBT8,"Certainly many people cam relate to the relationship of the two leads. Liked the movie, light-hearted, simple and entertaining. Good movie to watch with your wife, gf or female friend.",1393632000,,184,5.166666666666667
5138250,1,B0087ITBT8,Enjoy the first 15 minutes cause after that you'll be reading your junk mail.  Barbra's character is so annoying that it ruins what could be a funny movie idea.,1393632000,7,160,4.517241379310345
5138251,4,B0087ITBT8,Anyone that enjoys Barbra Streisand would enjoy this movie.  It is refreshing to see movies that are well written with much comedy.,1393632000,,131,4.954545454545454
5138252,4,B0087ITBT8,It was a funny movie but so true in relationships that at times can be tough until you really take the time to get to know the other person,1393632000,,139,3.8275862068965516
5138253,2,B0087ITBT8,The movie was entertaining but predicable.  I'm glad I didn't pay to watch it at theatre prices.  I love Streisand which is why I wanted to see it but she's done much better scripts in the past.,1393632000,,194,4.216216216216216
5138254,5,B0087ITBT8,"I love Barbara Streisand. It was great to see her in a movie again. However, I thought the concept was corny when the film was in the theaters. That's because the studio did not market it right. It was about much more than a over-baring mother smothering her adult son. It had layers. It was about a son ashamed of his failures, but too proud to talk to his mother. Also a single mother who raised a really intelligent young man who sucked at communication more than most guys. Now that's saying something. I'll admit, it's hard to communicate that message in 30 second ad or a movie trailer, especially if some childless career-driven schmuck is putting it together.",1393632000,,667,4.61344537815126
5138255,5,B0087ITBT8,"I loved this movie!  In an age when every movie has to have sex or violence...this is a refreshing change.  Funny without being crude, this movie shows the unconditional love between mother and son even though they both have their flaws.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.",1393632000,,278,4.75
5138256,2,B0087ITBT8,"I thought this show would be more funny, but it wasn't what I thought it would be. I was did not think it was a great movie",1393632000,,123,3.5925925925925926
5138257,4,B0087ITBT8,It's a very good movie....nice ending!!!  Gets you to think about your relationship with your parents!!!!  A must to watch!,1393632000,,123,5.1
5138258,3,B0087ITBT8,I wasn't please with this movie at all.  I just couldn't sit still and watch it all the way through....It didn't capture my attention at all.  A waste of time.,1393632000,,159,4.266666666666667
5138259,4,B0087ITBT8,"I have to say the beginning was about as slow as it could be, there was no laughing or crying- until the last twenty minutes. It was light hearted and funny. Have tissues handy for the end!",1393545600,,189,4.135135135135135
5138260,5,B0087ITBT8,Loved the mother son combination and appreciate as a mother with a son. It was heartwarming as well as funny.  We all have something to offer each other if we are just open.,1393545600,,173,4.242424242424242
5138261,4,B0087ITBT8,"Funny how even in real life parents and children often do not understand the simple part of being human in each other. This movie was a story about discovery. A mother who discovered her son. But more importantly a son who learned that his mother was more than ""his mother"". Each so much a like in feelings and behaviors. Each IMHO learning how the other is more than just a MOM or a SON. I laughed but more importantly I cried. It was a very good story that was just honestly about people learning more about the other side of the person they thought they knew.",1393545600,,562,4.311320754716981
5138262,3,B0087ITBT8,"It was not as expected. It wasn't really funny. It was not my kind of comedy. Barbra Streisand was good, but the plot needed more pizzazz.",1393545600,,138,4.346153846153846
5138263,3,B0087ITBT8,Fun and simple but in a good way. Mother son relationship was portrayed very well. Good premise. Funny dialogue. Ok,1393545600,,115,4.8

5138266,3,B0087ITBT8,Somewhat cute movie.  Could have used a better co-star with Barbara Streisand.  Guess Rogen was the only actor who accepted the part..,1393545600,,134,5.045454545454546
5138267,3,B0087ITBT8,"I enjoyed watching the story.  The Mother , Son relationship was portrayed very plainly.  Good to see how it was resolved.  Good endings always make me happy.",1393545600,,158,4.777777777777778

5138269,2,B0087ITBT8,It was a nice and a little dull movie.  The ending was the best part for me.  I'm glad I didn't pay cinema prices to see it though.,1393545600,,131,3.642857142857143
5138270,4,B0087ITBT8,We watched this on a whim and were pleasantly surprised by it. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.,1393545600,,109,4.5
5138271,3,B0087ITBT8,"it was an ok movie, predictable most of the time but at least its comedy did not have to rely on nudity or curse words. This being refreshing nowadays",1393545600,,150,4.206896551724138
5138272,5,B0087ITBT8,"I loved this movie, it's just a cute comedy/classic. It might remind you of your mother, and how much she can annoy you (I'm sure you annoy her too), but then you realize how much you love her/love each other!",1393545600,,209,4.25

5138276,3,B0087ITBT8,"It's Seth, it's Barbara. How bad could it be? Oh come on, it's funny. I laughed a lot, well, giggled maybe. It was super silly but fun. Is it cliche to say it has heart? If you have a mother who's proud of you, you'll find this funny. It's not gonna win any awards, but it's worth a few laughs.",1393545600,,294,3.9166666666666665

5138289,3,B0087ITBT8,"Wasn't the best film, debated giving it four stars.  It was only good because seth rogan was in it.

5138302,4,B0087ITBT8,Reminiscent of the embarrassing things parents do and the stubbornness some children apparently keep even into adulthood. Her son's stubbornness when she tried to give him good advice reminded me of my 12 year old. But much of what she said was ridiculous and useless so I guess it was hard for him to see when she actually had good advice. It was an easy watch. Not too deep but not dull.,1393372800,,389,4.416666666666667

5138367,1,B0087ITBT8,I couldn't even finish the movie. I barely made it half way into it and gave up. Streisand was just not in her best creation. Can't win em all I guess.,1393027200,,151,3.903225806451613

5138414,3,B0087ITBT8,the movie is ok overall.  It's very predictable throughout but does provide enough chuckles to make it worth a look if you're a big Rogen or Streisand fan.,1392854400,,155,4.535714285714286
5138415,3,B0087ITBT8,"Could have been more comical (and seems like it wanted to be), but the timing was off in the execution of the moments. It's a good story overall, it just misses the mark. Streisand looks great for her age, but just couldn't refrain from her cheap shots; an example, mentioning ""climate change"" (it has always snowed in Tennessee, Babs, don't fool yourself). Perhaps it was just good actors miscast... I'm glad I saw it, glad in bought it, but it's just not a memorable one.",1392854400,,473,4.576470588235294
5138416,4,B0087ITBT8,"Funny , down to earth! ! Great acting by Seth and Barbra! Real!! I could relate. Saw it with one of my sons and we laughed our heads off!",1392854400,,137,3.7586206896551726
5138417,5,B0087ITBT8,"So cute, Touching, funny, and beautiful portrayal of the relationship this mother and son have and how much the care for each other. Seth seemed very sincere in his performance, and Barbra was excellent as ever as well as beautiful!!!!",1392854400,,235,4.9
5138418,5,B0087ITBT8,I liked it.  I thought it was sweet and really captured what it is like to be a mom.  I thought Streisand was HILARIOUS!,1392768000,,120,3.9583333333333335
5138419,5,B0087ITBT8,Loved the journey of the mother and son.  Very nice story. Looks like they need to continue and travel again.,1392768000,,109,4.45

5138425,2,B0087ITBT8,Barbra's character was so annoying I didn't even finish the movie. She really grated and seemed more like a stereotype than a real person.,1392768000,,138,4.791666666666667
5138426,2,B0087ITBT8,"I started watching this and just got bored, very predictable and not very likable characters.  Streisand is the stereotypical overbearing mom and Rogen is the stereotypical 30 something who really doesn't want to hang out with his Mom but feels obligated.",1392768000,,255,5.219512195121951
5138427,3,B0087ITBT8,"Also predictable but enjoyable, fun to see Streisand again. Not a classic either.  You ask for too many words in a revue.",1392768000,,121,4.5

5138429,5,B0087ITBT8,"Enjoyed this movie.  Saw a bit of myself.  Being the single mother of two twenty something son's that are still single with
no serious relationships.  Will I be still mothering like she did in the movie and will I be off on a road trip with one of them as well someday?  I don't think anyone would be disappointed in this movie, it is entertaining and funny.",1392768000,,358,4.298507462686567
5138430,4,B0087ITBT8,"I enjoyed Guilt Trip.  It was just a good fun movie that anyone that has a bit of an overbearing mother can appreciate.  Even if you don't have this kind of mother, it is just a good Sunday afternoon movie to watch.",1392768000,,215,4.095238095238095
5138431,5,B0087ITBT8,I enjoyed it very much. Being a mom with adult children I related with it. The rolls start to change as your children get older. But what they forget is once a mom always a mom.,1392768000,,177,3.9444444444444446
5138432,5,B0087ITBT8,"Enjoyable film that flows smoothly.  Watched it on my Kindle Fire and I didn't leave the room without putting it on pause.  It was funny, and yet still in the realm of being believable.  The mother/son relationship was very plausible.",1392768000,,234,4.8
5138433,5,B0087ITBT8,Reminds me exactly of my life!! Love Barbara Streisand. The writer obviously knew my mother.....how else could the lines be so exactly what she said.... all the time.,1392768000,,166,4.964285714285714

5138435,1,B0087ITBT8,"Cliche ridden, stupid premise, dumb story. Streisand's portrayal of the doting, feisty jewish mother is dopey, dated cliched,
right out of what she believed such characters were like in the real world fifty years ago around the time she left it to
live in the fake world of celebrity and separation from reality. Seth Rogen was however bravely trying to endure the
awful script and gave some grounding to his performance. Too little to save this mess of crapola.",1392768000,6,462,4.860759493670886
5138436,5,B0087ITBT8,"Not typical Seth, more Barbra....  My mom and sister love her, I remember her early albums, great in FOCKERS, very good in this too.  Seth plays a good second.  It is relevant because it takes all kinds of kinds.  This showed that.  Definitely worth my time and I will watch again.",1392768000,,281,4.431372549019608

5138438,3,B0087ITBT8,"I chose this because I thought it really would be funny...at the beginning it was very funny.
As the picture continued I found myself bored and it wasn't as funny any more.  I also found it to be entertaining.
The end was ok but sorted expected more from the actors in this picture.
Barbra was good
Watch it if you want to be entertained and a no brainer",1392768000,,354,4.205882352941177
5138439,4,B0087ITBT8,"It reminded me so much of myself and my daughter, so I thought it was very funny.  It just got a little too much with the over exaggerated Jewish mother part!",1392681600,,158,4.096774193548387
5138440,1,B0087ITBT8,"If you dislike barbara streisand, this is a good movie to watch; since she plays an unlikeable person, it's quite believable.",1392681600,,125,5.0

5138444,3,B0087ITBT8,It was cute especially if you like Seth Rogan.  I'm a big fan of Barbara Streisand in general so its good to see her still acting,1392681600,,129,3.9615384615384617
5138445,5,B0087ITBT8,Light hearted story that is entertaining yet shows the love between a mother and son.  The mother's over attachment to the son is annoying to the son.  His response is to try to fix things for the mother by finding a long lost love.  This fails but there is still a happy ending!!!,1392681600,,281,4.264150943396227
5138446,2,B0087ITBT8,"The story line was predictable to say the least, don't know why it was rated as a comedy. Not worth the time.",1392681600,,109,4.0
5138447,4,B0087ITBT8,"I really enjoyed this movie,  Barbara Streisand's character is similar to her character in ""Meet the Fockers.""  Seth Rogen plays an outstanding character as Barbara's son.  I am sure many mom's can relate to this movie.",1392681600,,219,5.027777777777778
5138448,5,B0087ITBT8,"I was looking for simple minded humor one evening and happened onto this movie.  It had just the right balance of goofy humor and poignancy, and the chemistry between Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen was perfect. I llaughed out loud at this mother son combo.  But I also felt for them.  Very enjoyable.",1392681600,,301,4.6415094339622645

5138452,3,B0087ITBT8,"The movie started very slow, had to talk myself into watching at least half the movie. After that it did get a little better but was not anywhere near as funny as I expected.",1392681600,,174,4.147058823529412

5138455,5,B0087ITBT8,I can relate to mother son relationship. I'm huge Barbara Streisand fan. I like how they go on how road trip together,1392681600,,117,4.363636363636363
5138456,3,B0087ITBT8,Liked it for a movie when you are snowed in.  Held my interest but I don't think I would go out and pay $9.00 to see it.,1392681600,,120,3.4444444444444446
5138457,5,B0087ITBT8,It was a funny family movie. The two main characters were excellent. I would definitely recommend this movie to my family and friends.,1392681600,,134,4.869565217391305
5138458,2,B0087ITBT8,Not much to say. A couple cute scenes but pretty lame for the most part. This movie barely made me chuckle. Its too bad because Barbra can surely be a hoot at times!,1392681600,,165,4.03030303030303
5138459,4,B0087ITBT8,"I chose this movie, because I wanted a funny movie without a lot of drama.  Unfortunately, I was really tired when I started watching it and fell asleep.  I watched it again the next night and really enjoyed it.",1392681600,,211,4.384615384615385

5138461,4,B0087ITBT8,"This movie is funny, heart-warming and very entertaining. I am the mother of three grown sons so I could relate to many of the situations portrayed throughout the move.  I also love Barbara Streisand who did a great job. I enjoyed watching their cross country adventures.",1392595200,,271,4.891304347826087
5138462,4,B0087ITBT8,I enjoyed this as a movie that the plot was easy to follow and you could almost predict everything that happened but still something enjoyable to unwind to at the end of the week. Not small kid friendly.,1392595200,,203,4.368421052631579
5138463,4,B0087ITBT8,"The movie does have a bit of a slower pace, but I don't think that takes away from the overall quality at all. Streisand and Rogen are terrific together! This movie is very honest, and moving. If you are a mother, or have a mother, this movie will touch your heart.",1392595200,,265,4.215686274509804
5138464,3,B0087ITBT8,It is uneven and grating at times. You have to have a similar dynamic with someone in your life to find the humor.,1392595200,,114,4.0
5138465,4,B0087ITBT8,Loved the actors. Barbra Streisland is still terrific.  Very realistic and down to earth acting.  Good story line.  Highly entertaining.,1392595200,,136,5.7
5138466,5,B0087ITBT8,"We really liked this movie.  Finally, a decent and clean comedy.  Barbara Streisand does a great job at playing the overprotective mother and the commentary between the two is so quick witted and often hilarious.",1392595200,,212,5.0285714285714285

5138504,3,B0087ITBT8,"This was an okay movie, but not one I would watch more than once. There are some funny parts and Barbra Streisand plays the part very well.",1392508800,,139,4.185185185185185
5138505,2,B0087ITBT8,This movie is just stalled.  It takes too long to get to the point and to have any funny spots.,1392508800,,95,3.75
5138506,5,B0087ITBT8,It has been a long time since I watched a movie that made me laugh like this!  Intelligent and silly all at the same time.  I'd watch it again!,1392508800,,143,3.896551724137931
5138507,4,B0087ITBT8,"This is my first experience with roku Amazon prime, I find most of the prime movies very old but guilt trip was an exception,
This was my first day of a 30 day trial,, just seen an article that stated that Amazon .Com was seriously considering raising the price of prime $20.00, if so I will be canceling prime after my trial, and go with Netflix.",1392422400,,347,4.2727272727272725
5138508,3,B0087ITBT8,"Good movie with good mother/son connection.  Moms try to help - kids, especially adult kids, resist.  Then they end up understanding each other better.  Cliched, but good nevertheless.",1392422400,,184,5.5
5138509,1,B0087ITBT8,Could not finish watching this movie. Boring with a capital B. I like both these actors just never put them together again.,1392422400,5,123,4.636363636363637
5138510,3,B0087ITBT8,"Overall, pretty good, but this irritating mom was totally obsessed with her son.  Got a little better after he finally told her off.",1392422400,,132,4.739130434782608
5138511,4,B0087ITBT8,Actually enjoyed it more than I thought when picking it out as a 'standby' movie.  Developed nicely as it went along with some profound dialog between mother and son.  Both stars give good performances with a predictable plot but a delightful movie.  Move it out of 'standby' status!,1392422400,,283,4.854166666666667
5138512,4,B0087ITBT8,I think Barbara is really a funny actress and she and Seth Rogen were great together.  We worried that this would be stupid but it was actually really good.,1392422400,,156,4.379310344827586
5138513,4,B0087ITBT8,"if you have a mother that guilt's like mine, you'll love this! Rogen is pretty funny and Steisand pulls off the part perfectly.",1392422400,,127,4.565217391304348
5138514,4,B0087ITBT8,"Wasn't expecting such a lovely film.  The script was realistic and the acting subtle but right on.
 Love a happy ending for all involved",1392422400,,136,4.625
5138515,2,B0087ITBT8,"The beginning of the movie was funny.  But then it seemed it was going to be the same joke over and over.  Mom embarrasses son.  I started to feel I was about to be trapped in a car for a long, boring ride.  So I skipped to the end.  Which was okay.  Except for that ridiculous and trite cliche ""if it was meant to be, it would have happened"".  It could of been worse.  The line could have been ""everything happens for a reason.""  Two good stars but this is material for a sitcom, not a movie.",1392422400,,493,4.0
5138516,1,B0087ITBT8,"Slow, boring movie. Not at all funny, a complete waste of time watching this. Expected more from a good cast.",1392422400,,109,4.5

5138518,4,B0087ITBT8,This movie has similar humour to my actual relationship with my mother. I enjoyed watching this with her. I recommend. It does have a couple awkward parts,1392422400,,154,4.7407407407407405
5138519,4,B0087ITBT8,Nice slant on a mother son relationship. Humorous and fun to watch nice feel good movie. Good to see Barbara acting again.,1392422400,,122,4.590909090909091

5138521,5,B0087ITBT8,"Often we know about as much about a person as that person wishes us to know.  The major characteris in ""Guilt Trip"" are mother and son.  As the storyline progresses, we see much and feel more about the two and are amused and amazed.  Not all mothers are duplicates of Joyce,  but if we're honest mothers, we find ourselves herein!  ,",1392422400,,333,4.39344262295082
5138522,4,B0087ITBT8,"I enjoy Barbra Streisand, and this film allowed me to enjoy her to the right extent. She is adorable and very sweet as the mother, and her comical adventures across the continental U.S. are lovely if a bit lacking in coherence. The shtick with the son is cute too. It is also cut appropriately. I expected to enjoy this film and it did not disappoint.",1392422400,,351,4.415384615384616

5138524,3,B0087ITBT8,Barbara Streisand never disappoints. Seth Rogen is funny. Lighthearted. A good movie for when you just want to smile and not have to think too much.,1392422400,,148,4.730769230769231
5138525,3,B0087ITBT8,Guilt Trip is a light comedy.  Easy to watch and entertaining.  Not outstanding but fun to watch.  It wasn't worth watching a second time..,1392422400,,139,4.708333333333333
5138526,5,B0087ITBT8,"I expected a funny movie, which I got, what I didn't expect was what a touching movie it was. I would recommend this to anyone. I am even considering owning it. Really good movie!",1392422400,,179,4.294117647058823

5138530,4,B0087ITBT8,"OMG...this reminded me so much of my yearly family trips with my mother.  It was seriously funny and truly one to watch.  Momma may not find it funny, but children surely will understand!

Love Barbra Streisand...she is a wonderful actress (and one of my favorites)!!!",1392336000,,268,4.911111111111111
5138531,2,B0087ITBT8,"I had very low expect ions for this, and it largely lived up to those. I don't laugh out loud once, and found some of the situations humorous mainly because of how well Seth and Barbara sell the parts.  I did get the feeling of a very long trip with the stereotype mother.  But there are much better road trip movies out there, and much funnier ones.",1392336000,,350,4.208955223880597
5138532,5,B0087ITBT8,"As the mother of an adult male (an only child), I loved this movie. It made me laugh and cry - the best of both worlds.  The premise is cute and funny.  The conflicts are realistic.  The characters believable.  The love they share is undeniable.  Good blend of all the aforementioned - not too cutesy, not too lovey, not too antagonistic.
If only my son had to travel...",1392336000,,370,4.382352941176471

I would watch again! :-)",1392336000,,305,4.315789473684211

5138535,3,B0087ITBT8,Many of us would like to have the time to discover how a mother and son bond after leaving the nest.  The process of the son realizing the mother is a person and has street smarts that will help in in his quest.,1392336000,,211,3.9069767441860463

Mom-son relationship sometimes overdone, but often right-on... and very touching end scene at airport caused our eyes to well up. What more do you need for a Wednesday?!?",1392336000,,258,5.475
5138538,3,B0087ITBT8,"It was a fair movie, but nothing out of the ordinary.  Rogan needs to stick with stoner comedies and Streisand probably should go back in time and sing for the troops again.",1392336000,,173,4.40625
5138539,5,B0087ITBT8,"Really enjoyed watching this movie. Funny, heartwarming.  Both actors worked very well together in this film.  Barbra Steisand was very funny in this film as the Jewish overprotective Mother; Seth Rogen is great as usual.",1392336000,,221,5.285714285714286

5138542,4,B0087ITBT8,Funny and poignant. Any parent with a child that is teenage or older will appreciate it. It surprised me. Enjoy.,1392336000,,112,4.65
5138543,3,B0087ITBT8,It was a funny and cute movie...good actor combo and a good storyline.  I would recommend this movie to watch.,1392336000,,110,4.5

5138547,5,B0087ITBT8,This movie has such great humor and is heart touching. I cant believe Seth Rogen actually got to me. Never saw him as the serious type.,1392336000,,135,4.230769230769231

5138553,3,B0087ITBT8,Like both actors and thought it would be too smaltzy but again was running out of movies to find to watch on my Kindle so I watched it and I was pleasantly surprised with the theme of the movie.  I really like the way in which they spun the relationship between mom and son especially the way it evolved and got so much better.  It was very real.,1392249600,,346,4.073529411764706

5138595,3,B0087ITBT8,This movie wasn't as funny as I thought it would be but it had some funny moments. Barbara Streisand is always classic though.,1392076800,,126,4.521739130434782

5138601,4,B0087ITBT8,This was a good movie but it did have too much of the stereotypical Jewish mother whining dialog. It was a good time killer.,1392076800,,124,4.208333333333333

5138612,5,B0087ITBT8,Great movie that REALLY lets Barbra Streisand shine.  The dry wit and nerdy character of Rogen is a perfect pairing!,1392076800,,116,4.8
5138613,4,B0087ITBT8,Guilt trip was a very cute movie. It was funny but still had a sweet story line. We loved the ending.,1392076800,,101,3.857142857142857

5138619,5,B0087ITBT8,"I could go into detail about the chemistry between Rogan and Streisand blah blah but to sum it up I'm a 26 year old heterosexual man bored on a week night not expecting to like this whatsoever and found it completely captivating and hysterical after fully expecting it to be nothing more satisfying than background noise for my insomnia. Warm, fun, whatever, it's full of that rare, strong genuinely clean humor that can't be duplicated without a competent script, and it left me f@#$ing delighted.",1391990400,,498,4.870588235294117

5138634,4,B0087ITBT8,This movie was funny and held true to the way Mom's and son's react to each other. I would recommend watching this one.,1391990400,,119,4.217391304347826

5138636,2,B0087ITBT8,The show was quite boring and so predictable. Not one guys would like very much in my opinion. Did not finish watching.,1391990400,,119,4.454545454545454
5138637,4,B0087ITBT8,Funny and real to life of a relationship between Mother and son. Good movie to watch when you're tired of all the sex and violence in movies.,1391990400,,141,4.2592592592592595

5138641,4,B0087ITBT8,Funny and entertaining. Good plot with interesting characters. This is a good wholesome movie about the ulterior motives and guilts that lie just beneath the surface in family relationships.,1391990400,,190,5.586206896551724
5138642,5,B0087ITBT8,We wanted to watch something funny this weekend and this movie was PERFECT!! Very funny and a really cute story. We both totally enjoyed it and would recommend for anyone wanting to watch a great movie.,1391990400,,202,4.638888888888889
5138643,4,B0087ITBT8,"Very Good !!  I thought the actors were great. This was funny and real life drama. I would recommend this too adult children  and parents to watch, lessons to be learned!!",1391990400,,171,4.483870967741935
5138644,1,B0087ITBT8,"I expected so much more from this movie but was left disappointed.
The acting reminded me of a high school play where the actors forget some of their lines and decide to ad lib. It sounded stilted and awkward throughout.
I had thought this was a comedy but --Both of the characters were un likable and irritating. The plot was contrived and dull.
I've never given such a harsh rating but I want to save someone else from even starting to watch this movie. I wish I'd read some reviews before turning it on!",1391990400,,506,4.3936170212765955

It's the second piece of Seth Rogen junk I've subjected myself to in a year (the other was ""This is the End"").  It won't happen again.  YIKES!",1391817600,,369,4.246376811594203

5138686,4,B0087ITBT8,Cute movie. The mother was a little hard to take at times. It wasn't as funny as I thought it was going to be.,1391731200,,110,3.625
5138687,3,B0087ITBT8,It had some good moments. But from the trailer it looked like it would be a little more humorous than it was. But for the most part it was worth sitting through.,1391731200,,161,4.0625
5138688,4,B0087ITBT8,"I don't always like everything about Barbara Streisand but I am always pleasantly surprised by her movies.  This is very funny and sweet plus there are a lot of sight gags and nice scenery as the son and mom duo make it across the country.
I liked it.  It wasn't epic or artsy but it would be hard not to identify with some part of this movie.",1391731200,,343,4.104477611940299

I would recommend this movie to any mother to watch! It is a funny and a great family movie to watch",1391731200,,116,4.086956521739131
5138690,5,B0087ITBT8,It was so good to see a movie where the son was willing to do so much for his mother even though he thought it was going to be very taxing for him.  He made his mother so happy!,1391731200,,177,3.5384615384615383
5138691,5,B0087ITBT8,"This was a very enjoyable movie and was surprisingly appropriate/ not vulgar.  Was halfway expecting a movie charges with sexual content and innuendoes, but it turned out to be pretty wholesome.  Seth Rogen is great in this movie.",1391731200,,230,5.026315789473684
5138692,5,B0087ITBT8,"Liked this movie very much. Pleasure to watch their interaction, very relaxed and natural.  Funny and heartwarming.

5138696,3,B0087ITBT8,I watch movies while I ride my indoor bike and have been on a comedy kick lately.  It is a nice way to make the miles and time fly.  Although I liked this movie I definitely found it was let comedy and pure sweetness.  I thought Barbara stole the show with her acting and I loved the way the two find their way to each other as they cross the country.,1391731200,,351,3.915492957746479
5138697,5,B0087ITBT8,"Again I thought it was on my Prime Free site, I did not intend to pay to watch this.  I remember pressing the Free choice.  If it was free, then you need to reword ""Review your Purchases"". Movie was excellent.  Thank you.",1391731200,,221,4.214285714285714

5138700,3,B0087ITBT8,"This movie was 'easy' to watch, cute but I wouldn't go so far as to say it was 'hilarious.'  Barbra Streisand did a fine job as did Rogen.  I got the feeling that this was a movie that did not require either actor to stretch their acting muscles!  This is a movie I would recommend to the elderly or if you just want to take a 'mental' break for awhile, sit back and relax knowing it will all turn out great.",1391731200,,408,4.012345679012346

5138702,4,B0087ITBT8,Great comedy relief... hilarious. Great role for Ms Streisand demonstrating she still has what it takes! Simply an entertaining film.,1391731200,,133,5.7
5138703,5,B0087ITBT8,The movie makes you appreciate your mom a lot more. A must see for couples before a long day ends.,1391731200,,98,3.95
5138704,2,B0087ITBT8,This wasn't the best movie I've ever watched but had some funny Seth Rogen moments and was overall a tender theme. Can definitely watch as a family which is a plus!!,1391731200,,165,4.354838709677419
5138705,1,B0087ITBT8,"Not a bad storyline, but not really funny as advertised.  The front of the cover says, "" hilarious"" - not at all.",1391731200,,113,4.136363636363637
5138706,3,B0087ITBT8,"While I wanted to really be entertained by Seth Rogen (he's one of my favorites) This movies feels like  Dj vu to me!

If you like Bab's and Rogen I'd suggest giving this movie a go.  Seeing them act together was an experience..

It's pretty funny for the most part.
Would I see it again?  Definitely NOT!

I'd give this movie a rating of 3 on a scale from 1-10.  Depending upon your expectations of what you enjoy in a movie..I'd say, watch it once it becomes free on your Prime account.  Defiantly don't pay to watch it.",1391644800,,522,4.255102040816326

5138708,1,B0087ITBT8,IT was pretty bad and sadly this has a lot of truth to the people this age bringing parents with them to job interviews.  What is wrong with people.,1391644800,,148,4.103448275862069
5138709,4,B0087ITBT8,"If you are in the mood for a movie that is just quiet fun, this is it. Barbra does the Jewish mother routine but with a light hand. As her son, Seth balances affection and annoyance at her attentions. If there is such a thing as a fresh stereotype, then this movie has accomplished it.

This is a great movie for those times when you don't want to think too hard and just want something lighthearted and gentle.",1391644800,,411,4.269230769230769

5138711,5,B0087ITBT8,This was a great movie start to finish although should have been listed as a drama and not as a comedy as it was more touching than funny.,1391644800,,138,3.9642857142857144
5138712,3,B0087ITBT8,fun movie to watch.  not slow flowing which I thought it would be. enjoyed watching. can watch with children which is refreshing,1391644800,,128,4.818181818181818

5138714,3,B0087ITBT8,The road trip from hell. A mother who cannot stop talking and nagging her adult son. The son is too serious and scientific so some of mom's ideas are pretty good and work,1391644800,,170,4.181818181818182

5138718,5,B0087ITBT8,"I watched this on a whim, completely expecting it to be bad, but I actually enjoyed it quite a bit.  It's a typical son vs mom who gave up everything for him kind of set up, but it's a lot of fun to see the real stories play out, and to see the love the son clearly has to try and make his mother happier in the end.

I'd recommend this movie for people who love their families and whose families are quirky!",1391644800,,408,3.9036144578313254
5138719,5,B0087ITBT8,It was very cute.  I was totally entertained while riding as a passanger on a long road trip. I love Barbra Streisand!,1391644800,,118,4.363636363636363

5138722,4,B0087ITBT8,This is a mother and son road trip comedy/drama. It is a nice movie with lots of little recognizable moments that can either bring a wince or a smile and maybe even a tear. Not overly sappy. Not overly funny. But very just easy to watch and both actors make it seem real. I guess the movie makers had a problem of how to sell it to audiences so the tried to make it seem like a wacky movie. It is not. I recommend it for anyone who likes Barbara  and Seth and wants to pleasantly enjoy 90 minutes.,1391558400,,497,4.02020202020202

5138724,3,B0087ITBT8,I like almost anything with Seth Rogen. Movie had funny parts but Streisand starting getting on my nerves. Don't freak out Streisand fans......good premise just too much of it,1391558400,,175,5.068965517241379
5138725,4,B0087ITBT8,"I was surprised that there were a lot of laughs in this movie. I had not previously known anyone who actually saw this movie.  I thought it had just enough clich to make you laugh, but not so much that you think, enough already.",1391558400,,228,4.181818181818182

5138730,3,B0087ITBT8,"I liked the movie in general. It was funny. I started watching it, then had to stop, and it easily resumed a couple of days later. Though it did have a little freezing at the beginning, it seemed to ""fix"" itself. Thanks for making it free.",1391558400,,239,4.217391304347826
5138731,4,B0087ITBT8,Guilt Trip is a nice movie with two good actors. Barbra Streisand does a great job playing a overbearing mother.,1391558400,,112,4.65
5138732,4,B0087ITBT8,"I liked this movie and it was funny in places. Had a good story line and not much bad language, which is hard to find now a days. Never understood why the language in movies has gotten so bad. It is not impressive. Will watch again.",1391558400,,232,4.065217391304348
5138733,1,B0087ITBT8,"I'll be honest.  I turned off the movie.  It started slow, and never really improved before I gave up.  The parts that were supposed to be funny really fell flat.",1391558400,,162,4.333333333333333
5138734,4,B0087ITBT8,This is a cute sweet movie showing the relationship between mother and son.  I found it very true to life  Though the course of their trip I think they finally came to the realization they truly cared for each other!,1391558400,,216,4.375
5138735,4,B0087ITBT8,"Great portrayal of a well-intentioned smothering mother, and a patient but overwhelmed son. One of Streisand's best comedies
 in years.",1391558400,,135,5.75
5138736,4,B0087ITBT8,"Its possible that this movie is getting less than great reviews because people are expecting a comedy?  As a mother or a grown son, this story really hit home and I spent more time being touched than I did laughing.  There were some pretty slow parts in the movie and that is why it got 4 stars out of 5 stars.  It was well written and well acted.  The title ""Guilt Trip"" is misleading.  Its more a story about two people who learn to understand and value each other more while traveling across county.",1391558400,,502,4.297872340425532
5138737,3,B0087ITBT8,"I found certain parts of the movie humorous and I think both of the actors are great.  If I compare this to other comedies I'd watched I didn't feel it was hilarious(like the first hang over movie, that was really funny)",1391558400,,220,4.365853658536586

5138740,3,B0087ITBT8,Actually I would give it 3 1/2 if I knew how to do that. It was a nice story without sensational violence or sex. Enjoyable!,1391558400,,124,4.0
5138741,3,B0087ITBT8,"As often happens, the previews of this movie show the only funny parts of the movie.  Although it was a heart warming tale of mother and son finally getting to know each other, I was expected to laugh out loud.  Didn't happen",1391558400,,225,4.333333333333333

5138744,5,B0087ITBT8,I really liked the characters. I somewhat could relate to them. It.  was interesting to see their relationship go from very dysfunctional to a healthy mature adult one. I watched it twice. I will probably watch it again. I was really surprised by that .,1391558400,,253,4.622222222222222

5138752,4,B0087ITBT8,This was not my first choice but I was out voted. I enjoyed the movie more than I thougth . I think Barbara Streisand did well in this movie and the son was wonderful..it was so real to life.,1391472000,,191,3.923076923076923
5138753,1,B0087ITBT8,I couldn't even get through 30 min of this bore fest. Nothing was remotely funny. This film was anything but. Maybe it got better but if you're a third of the way through a comedy and barely crack a smile then you wasted you're time.,1391472000,,233,4.2
5138754,2,B0087ITBT8,Pretty much a repackaging of time worn stereotypes.  Some scenes ran way to long.  It did have the occasional line that was actually funny.  The acting was a bit overdone for the subject material --- trying to make something out of not much...,1391472000,,243,4.604651162790698
5138755,4,B0087ITBT8,This is a cute story. Barbara is always a joy to watch! Rogen was surprisingly fun to watch! He really is a believable character.,1391472000,,129,4.416666666666667
5138756,5,B0087ITBT8,I enjoyed this move a great deal; Barbara was great as the over the top mother.  And it was an sweet dynamic between a mother and a son; sometimes mother is right !,1391472000,,164,3.9696969696969697
5138757,3,B0087ITBT8,"i wouldnt recommend it, very slow start, they seemed to mesh better towards the end, it was overly cliche, and the jewish jersey , although well done as a caricature, was overdone as an actress",1391472000,,193,4.542857142857143
5138758,4,B0087ITBT8,"Barbra is a fabulous Jewish mom.

5138763,5,B0087ITBT8,"Super funny, unpredictable and a tear jerker for both genders. All the makes for a somewhat surprisingly good film on a night in! I say somewhat surprisingly because I never expect nothing but greatness from Mrs. Streisand but being a fan doesn't make me jaded to flops! You won't regret this choice though.",1391472000,,307,4.811320754716981
5138764,3,B0087ITBT8,Almost made you watch it til the end to see what happens. Just almost impossible to stay awake for it. They really need to stop paying off critics to rate these bore fest movies!,1391472000,,178,4.264705882352941
5138765,4,B0087ITBT8,"I love me some Barbara Streisand, she's an amazing actress...and she does her part as an overbearing mother justice!

5138769,3,B0087ITBT8,The movie had some really funny parts but the script over did the Jewish Mother syndrome. Barbara was good Rogan was good in places pity the script was up to their acting but it was an okay movie,1391472000,,195,4.157894736842105
5138770,3,B0087ITBT8,"Funny and sad at the same time.  I could relate cause I had a mother like that.  However, I learned at an early stage to stand up for myself with her.  Rough relationship....she's gone now and sadly I don't miss her.",1391472000,,216,4.219512195121951
5138771,5,B0087ITBT8,Really enjoyed watching this movie.  I would recommend it to anyone that's tired of the foul language and sexual implications in so many movies today.  Barbara Streisand was perfect for the part of the mother.,1391472000,,209,4.942857142857143
5138772,3,B0087ITBT8,It was entertaining but a little corny and the acting wasn't the best. Story line was cute....there were some funny parts,1391472000,,121,4.809523809523809
5138773,4,B0087ITBT8,Started a little slow but great story line with a nice finish. Was casted well too. Would reccommend to friends and family.,1391472000,,123,4.636363636363637

5138775,3,B0087ITBT8,Movie was fair to good.  Lightly entertaining for a quiet evening home.  Haven't seen Streisand in anything for a while.,1391472000,,120,4.95
5138776,3,B0087ITBT8,Light and funny!  Good story line filled with many humorous moments that runs throughout and comes together at the end.,1391472000,,119,4.95

5138778,4,B0087ITBT8,"Although not a huge Streisand fan, she does do some good acting and this was one of those times.  Predictable plot but entertaining,  Glad I didn't pay for theater.",1391472000,,164,4.620689655172414
5138779,4,B0087ITBT8,"Typical Streisand-style comedy. Cute, ""fluff"" movie that is safe to watch with my 8-year old. If you like ""Meet the Fockers"" type of movies, you'll like this.",1391472000,,158,4.888888888888889
5138780,5,B0087ITBT8,This movie is funny and warm .. a must see..Barbara and Seth make a great pair. It makes you think about your relationship with your motg,1391472000,,137,4.3076923076923075
5138781,5,B0087ITBT8,"Great movie with all too true senarios!!  Very touching as the mother of a son.  Love Barbara Streisand, she's a classic!",1391472000,,121,4.714285714285714
5138782,5,B0087ITBT8,Barbala was fabulous. Made me all verklempt.  Reminds of my own scenes with my mother. This movie is worth seeing.,1391472000,,114,4.7

5138784,3,B0087ITBT8,nothing to rave about......I watched it.....I got thru it.....some of it rang true.....some did not.....not on my list of high recommendations ....... watch it when u can't decide on anything else.....or u want some noise in the background,1391472000,,239,5.315789473684211
5138785,4,B0087ITBT8,I would recommend this to all families. It is funny and could very well happen in real life It is a great change from all the violence in the movies made today,1391472000,,159,4.0
5138786,4,B0087ITBT8,"A little slow to start with, and hard to picture Barbara Streisand in this role.  However, it picks up a little and the ending is what makes the movie memorable!!!  The ending alone makes it worth the watch.",1391385600,,207,4.421052631578948
5138787,1,B0087ITBT8,"The movie was very difficult to digest. Bad acting, equally bad dialogue. Had to turn it off....couldn't watch it anymore!!",1391385600,,123,5.2
5138788,1,B0087ITBT8,"Kinda lame, never gets off the ground, not much comedy, not much plot. Would not recommend unless someone was desperately bored.",1391385600,,128,5.142857142857143
5138789,5,B0087ITBT8,Really enjoyed it watched with the family and highly recommend it for all who want to laugh and feel it watch it and enjoy.,1391385600,,123,4.166666666666667
5138790,5,B0087ITBT8,"I have never laughed so hard at MYSELF!  Barbara cut to the core with her tacky exercise clothes, coupons, books on tape and mistimed calls.",1391385600,,140,4.6
5138791,5,B0087ITBT8,Loved it! The hubby liked it too. The acting was very well done and it was entertaining all the way to the end.,1391385600,,111,3.869565217391304
5138792,3,B0087ITBT8,"Would've been even much greater a movie if not for the over-usage of 'F-Bombs' and sexually suggestive innuendos!
So this is definitely NOT ya  ''Clean Barbara"" movie for the family! :) Makes the Fockers seem like a G-rated movie!

In any event, If the audience is an adult crowd.....it is hilarious!!!",1391385600,,302,4.901960784313726
5138793,4,B0087ITBT8,Cute movie. Nothing I'd care to see again.  It was definitely a feel good movie. Got a love Barbara Streisand!,1391385600,,110,4.5
5138794,5,B0087ITBT8,"I am memorized by Ms. Streisand and Mr. Rogan.  I watched all the way thru twice.  First time for the laughing-out-loud at similar Mom thing... Second, how short and fast it all goes.  Now, please go call your Mother!  Q",1391385600,,220,4.425
5138795,5,B0087ITBT8,"enjoyed this movie from the first minute! Streisand and Bogen don't exactly look like mother and son, but the pull it off beautifully!",1391385600,,134,4.869565217391305
5138796,2,B0087ITBT8,"The title of my review pretty much says it all.  I love both of these actors, but this movie is pretty saccharine and doesn't introduce anything new to comedy, like other movies I've seen with Seth Rogan.  Both lovable characters and was entertaining enough when I had nothing else to do and not in the mood for anything but a mindless comedy.",1391385600,,343,4.516129032258065
5138797,4,B0087ITBT8,"This movie had really bad ratings, but I actually thought it was pretty funny. Give it a chance. It is one of the better free movies.",1391385600,,133,4.153846153846154
5138798,4,B0087ITBT8,"Funny - an enjoyable evenings entertainment. Light and airy, not a lot of thought required. Worth spending a couple of hours on.",1391385600,,128,4.863636363636363
5138799,5,B0087ITBT8,"Sweet, sweet story. Both Barbara and Seth did amazing job acting. I enjoyed this movie very much. Twice so far as a matter of fact.",1391385600,,131,4.28
5138800,5,B0087ITBT8,These two played well off each other .You actually could believe they were mother and son. We both loved it.,1391385600,,108,4.45
5138801,4,B0087ITBT8,"This was a really good movie. Great lead actors. Good story. Humorous. Sometimes I just felt like it was moving along a little slowly but not entirely in a bad way, I was just impatient maybe! Would definitely watch again.",1391385600,,222,4.575
5138802,5,B0087ITBT8,"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie .... Related as  I raised my son alone, too.  My son thought I was annoying by always checking on him.....check her out!  She loves her son so much and can't get enough of him.  It was fun making the cross country trip with them and her adventures.  They reversed roles there for a bit, he was the parental figure and she the child!

I like Barbra Streisand as an actress....she is a perfectionist.  Being close in age, I think it is wonderful that Hollywood recognizes that the Baby Boomers are in the majority and not ignoring us......great seeing her star in a movie and not just having a bit part.

Watch this one if you enjoy a wholesome movie, light comedy with no ""f"" bombs and has an actual story.",1391385600,,735,4.432835820895522
5138803,2,B0087ITBT8,"It says that the movie is hilarious, however, not even funny. There wasn't a part where we laughed out loud.",1391385600,,108,4.45
5138804,5,B0087ITBT8,"Smart film with two extraordinarily intelligent and talented actors. They each will be remembered for the ages, and this film will always be viewed fondly. Boy, do they work well together. I'd like to see another with this pairing!",1391385600,,231,4.948717948717949
5138805,4,B0087ITBT8,"I like all of the actors and the story was good - just a bit predicatable.  It is very similar to the Debbie Reynold's film ""Mother"".  It was worth watching.",1391385600,,157,4.2
5138806,2,B0087ITBT8,I selected this movie because of Streisand.  She repeats her feeding frenzy scene as in Funny Girl.  Not a movie that will stick with you,1391385600,,137,4.44
5138807,4,B0087ITBT8,"Not sure where the ""hilarious"" rating came in but overall a good movie.  Barbra can speak so well with her eyes I found myself crying a few times when she wasn't saying a word.",1391385600,,176,4.176470588235294
5138808,4,B0087ITBT8,"Watched this with the family.  None of us expected much.  Road trip type movies have been so overdone, but all of us found it really entertaining and funny.  Streisand's performance was great and her character probably reminds many of us of our moms.  Seth Rogan was perfectly casted for this role as well.  His delivery is amazing and kept us laughing through the whole movie.

There are some strong languages and not so clean scenes in a few parts of the movie so I would say this is maybe more of a PG-15 movie.  Certainly wouldn't want your 3 year old watching this.  All in all though, it was good fun.",1391385600,,607,4.405405405405405
5138809,4,B0087ITBT8,I found the Guilt Trip to be totally amusing on a Friday night after a long weeks work.  Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen worked well together.  They were very believable.  It made me laugh.,1391385600,,189,4.5
5138810,3,B0087ITBT8,"The movie is not quite a comedy but more of a light hearted drama
Overall I enjoyed the movie and recommend it to others",1391385600,,120,4.041666666666667
5138811,4,B0087ITBT8,I love Barbra Streisand! She is such a great singer and comic. She played this roll perfectly. Enjoyed the movie.,1391385600,,113,4.7
5138812,3,B0087ITBT8,"This was a cute movie. More of a Mom movie. Not as funny as it could have been, but still ok.",1391385600,,93,3.4761904761904763
5138813,5,B0087ITBT8,"Hysterical movie! Better then what I expected. Streisand and Rogen are great together. Such a fun part to see Streisand play, very different from her usual roles.",1391385600,,162,5.037037037037037
5138814,3,B0087ITBT8,this movie really wasn't that funny. it was an okay story and good acting but probably would more accurately be billed as drama. the comedy wasn't fully there.,1391385600,,159,4.714285714285714
5138815,5,B0087ITBT8,"This is a Great family movie to watch. We recommend everyone to watch it.  Also, it's funny.  Great Mother & Son movie to watch.",1391385600,,128,4.291666666666667
5138816,3,B0087ITBT8,"This had some funny moments, but not a straight up comedy. It's more about an changing/maturing relationship between a mother and son. It's sad and hard to watch at times how much they struggle against each other. Then other moments are truly laugh out loud. Watch, but don't expect a straight up comedy.",1391385600,,304,4.754716981132075
5138817,4,B0087ITBT8,"Enjoyable film, with just enough funny moments and warmth in the characters to keep you going.
Has a great ending.
Streisand and Rogen both deliver good performances and are a great team.

The film has a positive feel and message.

There are a few swear words that weren't necessary.",1391385600,,283,4.755102040816326
5138818,3,B0087ITBT8,Guilt Trip was an enjoyable movie and good for a few laughs.  I'm glad we watched it once but do not need to see it again.  It's bubblegum for the mind!,1391299200,,152,3.870967741935484
5138819,4,B0087ITBT8,It deserved better than the 3 1/2 stars we saw when looking for a comedy.  The actors were a good comedy team and we thoroughly enjoyed it.,1391299200,,139,4.148148148148148
5138820,4,B0087ITBT8,I liked this movie.  I watched it on amazon prime I wouldn't really recommend buying it because to me it wasn't a movie I would need to watch twice but I enjoyed watching it. The movie ended like there could be a sequel and I think it would be a good one.  The movie made me think who ever wrote it watched  Oprah and a lot of other tv.,1391299200,,336,3.8405797101449277
5138821,4,B0087ITBT8,"A great throw-back comedy.  A little predictable, but I enjoyed the ride.
It didn't get bogged down with the drama of many relationship movies.",1391299200,,143,4.958333333333333
5138822,3,B0087ITBT8,"A good movie with a lot of laughs.  I think this movie will appeal to many because it is quite hilarious.
Certainly was worth the time spent watching it.",1391299200,,153,4.275862068965517
5138823,5,B0087ITBT8,"I love Barbra!  So this caught my eye, and I must say,mi really enjoyed this movie!  As a mom with a grown son, I could see myself in 'Babs' depiction of an empty-nester mom who misses her son and wants the best for him while overstepping the boundaries!  I watched this alone while on my elliptical in the basement, but my husband asked me what I was doing since he heard me laughing hysterically repeatedly! I must admit that my laughter produced tears of joy that mingled with the sweat of my exercise.  Now I know this movie held my attention/interest because I watched the entire thing while working out.....and that is a first!  Even though this movie didn't win any awards, etc. I think it was a great escape....it made my dreaded task of exercising go quickly, plus it raised my serotonin levels tickling my funny one!  Oh, there were even instances that I thought: OMG, that's me!

It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I enjoyed it!  Give it a try!",1391299200,,961,4.451428571428571
5138824,5,B0087ITBT8,I loved it. Love Barbara!!! The interaction between her and her son is great. There cross county adventure. Is very entertaining,1391299200,,128,5.142857142857143

5138826,5,B0087ITBT8,"I can totally relate to this movie. Fortunately the movie was better than real life! I just went on a cross country trip with my father and it was very much like the movie. I can only imagine if I was with my mother, God bless her soul.",1391299200,,236,3.9375
5138827,2,B0087ITBT8,"I couldn't even pay attention it was not a movie that grabs your attention. Disappointed. Would have liked it to be ""hilarious"" like the other reviews say cause it was not.",1391299200,,172,4.580645161290323

5138829,1,B0087ITBT8,Slow moving script and dry humor failed to create interest.  The movie never rebounded and  ended as blandly as it started,1391299200,,122,4.761904761904762
5138830,2,B0087ITBT8,I didn't sense chemistry between Seth and Barbra Streisand.  The comedy seemed forced at best improvised.  I do understand what they were going for but it didn't fly.,1391299200,,166,4.892857142857143
5138831,3,B0087ITBT8,"This movie was entertaining yet kinda realistic because any adult child could related to this parent-child relationship. However, I wouldn't ever invite my father or my mother to join me on a road trip because it wouldn't be as entertaining like with this movie.",1391299200,,262,4.9772727272727275
5138832,5,B0087ITBT8,It was great to see B again in a movie she is timeless. Very funny and poignant.  I enjoy the amazon prime streaming movies and plan to renew next year!,1391299200,,152,4.066666666666666

5138834,5,B0087ITBT8,"It was pretty awesome. Reminds me of my mom and the memorable moments we have had. Despite those moments being limited because of work, school and relationships, its nice to be able to create some great memories.

5138840,5,B0087ITBT8,"Seth and Barbara make an excellent pair as guilt-ridden son and (the source of the guilt) mother.

Their road trip is delightful...the movie was light on it's feet and a fine (but hilarious) study of how Mothers can turn things around to be all about them, and do it in a way that makes you feel guilty for ever thinking otherwise.",1391212800,,331,4.426229508196721

5138853,3,B0087ITBT8,Some of the humor just didn't work. I think it was the script more than the actors. There were a few  funny moments that I enjoyed.,1391212800,,131,4.038461538461538

5138859,4,B0087ITBT8,"I just thought it would be funnier, but it was good. Mom got on my nerves, but Streisand is always a good actress.",1391126400,,114,4.0

5138867,1,B0087ITBT8,"too frantic. maybe I just wasn't in the mood or maybe I've moved past the appeal of ""Jewish"" mother guilt being funny.  I've enjoyed movies by both of them before.",1391126400,,163,4.433333333333334

5138874,4,B0087ITBT8,"If you have a mother that seems to always ""pushes your buttons"" as an adult, you gotta see this... plus it is funny!

Hilarious but realistic and was never boring

The only reason i did not give it a 5 star is that I do not like the liberal Ms. Streisand and watching a movie that she is in puts money in her pocket",1391126400,,315,3.90625
5138875,5,B0087ITBT8,The hd came through so nicely and it was such an entertaining movie. A clearly dysfunctional family and how they work out their problems  to become extremely close as they should be. Sometimes family is all you have,1391126400,,215,4.657894736842105
5138876,5,B0087ITBT8,"I have not seen Barbra Streisand in a long time on film, and had forgotten what a brilliant comedic actress she is. Seth Rogan is a perfect foil for her.

5138885,5,B0087ITBT8,Love Barbara Streisand and loved her character in this movie.  Somehow think that there are many mothers that can relate to her character.  Definately watch with your older teen/young adult children.  Created a lot of great conversation.,1391126400,,237,5.351351351351352
5138886,5,B0087ITBT8,"First, I'm so glad I'm trying out Amazon Prime.  I don't usually have time to sit down and watch a whole movie and with prime I can stop it at any time and come back at my convenience to finish it.

I love the interaction of these two characters -- the actors are believable as mother and son and their journey in a small car both grates on their nerves and is a conduit to learn much about each other that they would never had known otherwise.",1391126400,,444,4.091954022988506

5138889,2,B0087ITBT8,I turned this off after about thirty minutes. It was too boring. A hen pecked son is guilted into doing boring things with his overbearing mother. This movie is a waste of time.,1391126400,,177,4.393939393939394
5138890,4,B0087ITBT8,It was a good movie and I think only had 1 word that starts with F... So hard to find a movie that isn't word filthy.... We need more funny movies that can be watched before the kids have to go to bed.....,1391040000,,205,3.7906976744186047

5138895,3,B0087ITBT8,"twenty or more words? pretty predictable, but some honest moments. decent acting. it's remarkable for what it's NOT. it's not disgusting or violent or offensive, and it hasn't got:
 the usual totally gratuitous female nudity in the beginning. (often a mutilated body)
 or the boring naked sex scene (fun to run in FF, or can serve for time to make a quick sandwich.)
 or the exaggerated kissing, with the usual 3 ""click sounds"" per kiss, added in post production.
 chase and/or fight scenes...ho hum...
 as a harmless time-killer it's  better than most rom-coms etc.",1391040000,,566,4.968085106382978

5138897,5,B0087ITBT8,I really enjoyed this movie a lot. I thought that it wasn't going to be that great but I was wrong.

I thought Seth Rogen's performance was ok, but I just felt like the character lacked some of his best qualities that he brings. Overall I thought the storyline was great. We need more movies like this.",1391040000,,281,4.529411764705882

5138912,4,B0087ITBT8,"Rogen still has a nasty potty mouth, but overall I liked the movie.  Streisand has aged well and plays the part of a doting mother to a T.",1391040000,,138,3.9285714285714284

I think I may have laughed at ONE part, which I can't remember anymore, so it couldn't have been that funny...  This show was pretty dull and it was full of hyper mom, cranky son moments.

It was funny when it should of been and the moral of the story was just right on.
Sons should be made to watch it, grown ones that is, and Mothers everywhere with sons will fit it in their life, I did. for each of mine, and they are very different.

Sure hope to see Barbra again soon. She is a wonderful actress.",1390867200,,443,3.9775280898876404

5139005,2,B0087ITBT8,"Not a lot going on. Movie never really hits a stride, it's just kind of flat from start to finish.
There are some highlights, but there is little to no supporting character development (and there is plenty of opportunity for it).

Seth Rogen struggles to put forth a ""serious"" role, while the movie could have lent itself to his more natural acting style and been a hit.
Rogen fans will be disappointed, since he tangibly feels constrained the entire film. I'm not even a huge fan of his, and I could feel it throughout the movie. Streisand's character comes across depressing, and again flat, and never gives the good comic pay-off she could have delivered. And if the movie had been written in a fashion as to be a more of a deep drama, she may have been able to push more emotion into it.
It's not a comedy, but it does not really feel like a drama, and fails to be a ""warm-hearted"" movie.
I blame the writers for not developing the characters, and the director for not keeping the pace of the film fast enough to keep you from being bored.

Overall, it's just okay. If there's nothing on one rainy Sunday afternoon, and you truly have seen everything else in your queue, then you might enjoy it.",1390867200,,1199,4.445454545454545

My surprise was that they actually worked well together and I feel the movie worked.  I give this ""2 thumbs up"".  Maybe, the audience with grown children (Streisand generation) will find this movie more humorous than the Rogen generation.....",1390867200,,420,4.928571428571429

In this role he was very good, he was pained, fustrated, excited and dealing with a relationship with his mother as a adult for the first time.

It didn't. If you're bored and have nothing else to watch, then it's okay.",1390867200,,244,4.444444444444445
5139040,5,B0087ITBT8,"Great casting.  Seth Rogan is perfect, and so is Barbara.  This is a good movie for its comedy, for its examination of the son-mother relationship, and for its juxtaposition of the contrasting values of the Baby-Boomer and the Millennial generations.  Warm, but not cheesy.  Funny!  Glad I watched it.  I'm a Seth Rogan fan from his Freaks-and-Geeks days, but so many of his movies are raunchy, so I can't watch them.  This was good in that regard.",1390867200,,448,4.740259740259741

Great to get your mind off of something else, a distraction.

5139054,4,B0087ITBT8,In the beginning of movie I found the constant rambling of  Barbara Streisand annoying but as the movie moved on I got the feel of the movie and the relationship between mother and Son.  As the movie was coming to an end I was falling in love with their relationship and found myself with tears in my eyes at the end.,1390780800,,317,4.180327868852459
5139055,3,B0087ITBT8,This is a different kind of movie for Barbra. She is endearing and vulnerable and I could see in her behavior some of the mistakes that I have made with my own children. A nice funny movie.,1390780800,,189,4.135135135135135

5139061,3,B0087ITBT8,"As a long-time Streisand fan, I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy this light comedy.  Streisand played the typical Jewish/New Jersey mother, which was annoying as hell some of the time, but so true to life.  I am so glad the storyline made Streisand likeable by the end of the movie - saved it in other words.  I did not get antsy during the show - looked forward to what would happen next.  Very good writing to name Andy's daughter after Streisand's character.  Joyce sure must have had some fantastic metabolism - all that munchy and M&M eating.  All in all, an enjoyable 1 1/2 hour.",1390694400,,586,4.533333333333333

I had some good chuckles.,1390608000,,317,3.716417910447761

Not being showy or wildly entertaining is actually why I chose to give this movie a 5 star rating. I think it can be compared side by side with Office Space in the sense that it has a realistic storyline and characters. If anyone gave this movie a low rating or didn't watch the whole thing, I think you could attribute much of that to the viewer not being in the right mood to watch this type of movie.

5139079,2,B0087ITBT8,I just didn't like it.  The story line was weak and it just wasn't well written.  Not really any funny momments.  The acting was fine but the dialogue wasn't good.  It just wasn't a very entertaining story.,1390521600,4,206,4.486486486486487
5139080,5,B0087ITBT8,"First, this is not your typical Seth Rogen movie! Rogen and Streisand are magical, comical and endearing and IMO viewers will either love it or hate it.
You might love it if you have or know of a nagging family (in particular from the Northeast- where the accent IS the punch line). And you might hate it if you have a nagging family member (from anywhere) who just insists on getting under your skin.
Since I no longer ""deal"" with my Northeast family on a daily basis anymore, I found the movie comical and for the most part relatable (i.e. the accent, the constant worrying, the nagging and the wanting to move away). But, at the end of the day, family is family and you manage to love them one way or another.",1390521600,,712,4.360902255639098

5139083,4,B0087ITBT8,we enjoyed this movie.  It was entertaining - somewhat predictable but it wasn't supposed to be some life altering drama. I would recommend it for a light hearted easy to enjoy film.,1390521600,,182,4.6875

Seth Rogan played well, but he had a real scene stealer to contend with.  The premise was good, and the comedy had some wit to it, rather than relying on smut humor, which I consider humor for the stupid person.

5139121,3,B0087ITBT8,"I enjoyed this movie because I like Barbra Streisand. I don't think it is her at her best by any means, but it does make for a fun film to just relax and enjoy.",1390435200,,160,3.735294117647059
5139122,4,B0087ITBT8,"All I can say about this movie, is that I loved it. Truly a good movie, if you like comedy. Must see.",1390435200,,101,3.6363636363636362
5139123,3,B0087ITBT8,"Definitely not a ""hilarious"" movie. It's entertaining at most. This is one of those movies where at the end you either feel bad about your own relationship with your mother or you feel good about yourself because you're fortunate enough to have a perfect life. Certainly has its humorous scenes and worth watching if you're just looking for a cute ""I can relate to that"" movie",1390435200,,376,4.712121212121212
5139124,3,B0087ITBT8,"Not that funny. Movie focused on ""mom"" who was a bit annoying but overall an okay movie. I give it three stars.",1390435200,,111,4.090909090909091
5139125,1,B0087ITBT8,"Did they not do a test to see if there was any chemistry between these two ?  Awkward, is the best way to describe the interaction and dialog in this movie. It was not funny at all. I am surprised Barbra Streisand made this movie, she is much better at acting than this.",1390435200,,270,4.09433962264151

Made a good family movie night.",1390435200,,113,4.181818181818182
5139128,4,B0087ITBT8,A funny movie. Taken from real life. Well done. I watched it twice.  anyone can relate to this road trip.,1390348800,,105,4.25
5139129,3,B0087ITBT8,"SURPRISE!  It's a good movie.  I didn't  want to watch this movie because I thought it was about:  guy goes on road trip with nagging mother. Jewish guy goes on road trip with nagging Jewish mother. Any ethnic guy goes on road trip with any nagging ethnic mother. Mother behaves embarrassingly terrible. Son is cool but embarrassed.

Surprise! It wasn't exactly like that.  It had a nice meaning. The self interpretations of being slighted or over-criticized were self
MIS-interpretations.  Neither the son nor the mother looked terribly bad and it turned out to be a sweet movie.

I recommend. It is, still, only a three star movie ...",1390348800,,636,4.824074074074074
5139130,3,B0087ITBT8,started slow....then picked up....had a good ending. I liked the fact that even when a relationship is dysfunctional there is a way for people to show they love one another,1390348800,,172,4.766666666666667
5139131,2,B0087ITBT8,"Very disappointed in this movie.  Acting was so contrived as to be annoying.  Why does this boy hate his mother sooo much when she clearly loves him so?  Sorry Babs--you will always be my Funny Girl...so I would rather hear you sing ""Oh my man I love him so!""...he'll never know.  I had to turn this movie off.",1390348800,,310,4.293103448275862
5139132,4,B0087ITBT8,I like this movie. It gave me 90 minutes relaxing time. Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen played well the mother-son relationship. It is worth the time to watch it.,1390348800,,162,4.620689655172414
5139133,1,B0087ITBT8,I wish I could find one or two good things to say about this movie but I can't. Don't waste your time.,1390348800,,102,3.6818181818181817

5139135,1,B0087ITBT8,terrible it seemed like Barbra Streisand has never been in front of a camera worst movie I have seen her in and one of the worst movies I have never watched put me to sleep in the first 30 minutes.,1390348800,,197,3.95
5139136,5,B0087ITBT8,I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. It was super funny and entertaining. Seth Rogen and Barbara Streisand are a wonderful combination!,1390348800,,141,5.173913043478261
5139137,5,B0087ITBT8,"This movie represented every mom and child.  A road trip which ended in a parent-child becoming friends and understanding each as an adult.  The child thankful for the parent role and the mother understanding the role of child to parent.  Made me laugh, cry etc..",1390348800,,263,4.8
5139138,3,B0087ITBT8,It was ok. Not quite what I expected. Some parts were funny and some were just stupid.  Probably not one to watch again.,1390348800,,120,4.217391304347826

5139140,3,B0087ITBT8,This was a cute movie.  Light hearted laugh.  Not the best but will pass the time.  A different kind of role for Streisand.  They made a good team.,1390348800,,147,4.142857142857143
5139141,3,B0087ITBT8,"This film was fun. It had some funny, cute lines. It has a couple twists/turns that make it not quite so predictable. Just an easy-going nice movie. We enjoyed it because there wasn't anything really crass or gross; just a good story with realistic humor.",1390348800,,255,4.688888888888889
5139142,4,B0087ITBT8,Guilt Trip was a great show. I was surprised. Very moving and funny show to view with Barbra Streisand playing the mother.,1390348800,,122,4.590909090909091
5139143,5,B0087ITBT8,"Good acting to portray the back and forth relationship between mother and son. The trip of a lifetime was both bonding and ""a guilt trip"".  Chick flick for sure.",1390348800,,161,4.551724137931035
5139144,3,B0087ITBT8,"It is often strange when some ""stars"" attempt to revamp their careers and personnae with movie vehicles that actually cause their former profile to be tarnished by doing that particular movie. This is certainly one of those ""tarnishing"" movies - especially for Babs. I selected this movie because Babs was in it and after having sat through many ""weak"" jokes and the later attempt to redeem the movie by getting really maudlin, I wish I had not taken the chance. Too bad, so sad - I guess the money made it all worthwhile for the former star.",1390348800,,542,4.597938144329897
5139145,3,B0087ITBT8,OK ~ Nothing to write home about.  Like I said it's just OK.  It's not as funny as I thought it would be.,1390348800,,105,3.5217391304347827
5139146,2,B0087ITBT8,"Boring, clichd, and not very funny. The acting was okay but the actors had little to work with. I guess on a cold snowy day it will pass the time.",1390348800,,146,3.9
5139147,5,B0087ITBT8,The movie is very funny and up lifting.  You can identify with the characters.  I would highly recommend this movie if you want to watch something that will make you laugh.,1390348800,,172,4.516129032258065
5139148,3,B0087ITBT8,It was alright I am a Barbara Strisand van but it was a little too silly for my taste. Just okay,1390348800,,96,3.619047619047619

5139150,3,B0087ITBT8,"It was a really good movie with a surprising ending. This was a tug at your heart, week night chill movie, but I wasn't blown away so it gets 3 stars from me.",1390348800,,158,3.8181818181818183
5139151,4,B0087ITBT8,"Cute movie, mainly because of the cast. It digs deeper than expected. Just the right mix of humor and thought. Gotta love Streisand in this!!",1390348800,,141,4.68

5139156,3,B0087ITBT8,Liked the movie a lot and seeing Streisand in one of her classic comedic roles.  I watched it on my iPad and was not satisfied with the quality of the viewing Amazon Streaming offered. . .didn't fill the screen like Netflix does.,1390348800,,229,4.4523809523809526
5139157,3,B0087ITBT8,This movie was not as good as all the hype about it but it did have some good laughs and a pretty good story line. I wouldn't go to the theater for this one but it is good enough to rent from the video library.,1390348800,,210,3.688888888888889
5139158,4,B0087ITBT8,Guilt Trip was an entertaining movie about a mother and son who come to know themselves and each other better on a road trip. Most of us can see a little of ourselves in these two characters. Dialogue and situations ranged from amusing to laugh-out-loud funny.,1390348800,,260,4.673913043478261
5139159,4,B0087ITBT8,"Very funny, good for a winter afternoon. A different comedy without all the boyfriend, girlfriend stuff! Husband and I enjoyed it.",1390348800,,130,5.238095238095238

Hate hate boring not wealth spending your time watching this garbage",1390348800,,155,5.5

5139162,1,B0087ITBT8,"the movie dragged and missed many obvious plot improvements, I could have written a better movie in my sleep. BORING

dont watch it!!!!",1390348800,,135,4.869565217391305
5139163,1,B0087ITBT8,Really not funny - characters are sad - didn't watch it all quit after about half way through maybe it gets better?,1390348800,,115,4.2727272727272725
5139164,4,B0087ITBT8,"If you can watch this until the end it has a great ending. It's a cute mother child movie. And overall true. Andy should listen to his Mother. And she's
Upset he doesn't tell her everything.",1390348800,,190,4.305555555555555
5139165,4,B0087ITBT8,Funny how different it is between mom and son there outlook on life and love enjoyed the movie good view,1390348800,,104,4.25

5139167,5,B0087ITBT8,"I enjoyed this movie so much, especially after the first half. The first half was a little much for me but was a great foundation for the second half. GREAT STORY.",1390348800,,163,4.290322580645161
5139168,1,B0087ITBT8,"Barbara Streisand was extremely annoying in this movie - I know that was her character in the film, but I didn't watch the whole movie because of it. I just didn't like it - what I saw of it.",1390348800,,191,3.923076923076923
5139169,4,B0087ITBT8,Great son and mother movie. Made us both laugh. Funny to see both sides. And a 4lb steak!!! Would recommend,1390348800,,107,4.4
5139170,2,B0087ITBT8,Found this movie to be slow and boring.  Actors not at their best and movie very predictable!  No return visits to this one.,1390348800,,124,4.3478260869565215
5139171,1,B0087ITBT8,I generally like Barbra Streisand but she succeeded too well in portraying the annoying interfering helicopter mother.  I was so annoyed I was tempted to stop watching mid-viewing.  Improved slightly by the time the credits rolled but not enough to warrant spending two hours of my time.,1390348800,,287,5.085106382978723
5139172,3,B0087ITBT8,"It's predictable and kind of goofy but, if you feel like a comedy you could do worse. Seth Rogan provides some memorable moments. Streisand is one of the great voices of our time but not known so much for her great comedy portrayals. She gets by with the role of the overbearing mother because I'm sure she can call on some real life inspiration from her own motherhood. As I'm sure many parents could. There is a nice twist near the end.

You may like it. Then again.....it's not four stars.",1390348800,,492,4.406593406593407

5139177,5,B0087ITBT8,Great movie was very funny.  Nice to see Barbra Streisand  in a movie again.  Iwould watch this movie again .,1390262400,,109,4.35
5139178,3,B0087ITBT8,Not worth watching if you are interested in quality comedy. There are many more valuable movies to watch. Don't waist your time.,1390262400,,128,4.863636363636363

5139181,1,B0087ITBT8,"and nothing more. Barbara Streisand played the typical Jewish mother that got into the middle of all her son's business. Sometimes funny, but I expected more from Seth Bogen. Him playing a chemist nerd was not believable.",1390262400,,221,5.0
5139182,1,B0087ITBT8,"This movie had the potential to be funny. It sadly did not live up to its potential. Very, very disappointing",1390262400,,109,4.5
5139183,5,B0087ITBT8,Enjoyed the movie tremendously.  Reminded me of our hysterical family situations.  Acting was very natural and chemistry between actors was great.,1390262400,,146,5.904761904761905

5139189,3,B0087ITBT8,Cute and it doesn't hold my attention that long. It made it easier for me to pause and get drinks and have bathroom breaks.,1390262400,,123,4.166666666666667
5139190,5,B0087ITBT8,My wife and i were throughly amused.  Both the stars did a great job in presenting the tension and the love in the relationship.,1390262400,,128,4.333333333333333

5139193,1,B0087ITBT8,I little laugh here and there. I would not define this as hilarious. Glad I watched it for free on Prime.,1390262400,2,105,4.0476190476190474

5139195,2,B0087ITBT8,"This was a step down to the quality of movies. Even for comedy, quality lacking. Lost interest real quick.  Better pick up book and read.",1390262400,,137,4.48
5139196,4,B0087ITBT8,This movie is funny and it hits home in a parent-offspring relationship. Liked it because there wasn't offensive scenes or language. Good movie. I would recommend it. I like Barbra Streisand,1390262400,,190,5.161290322580645

5139217,2,B0087ITBT8,The movie just seemed too slow and dragged on.  I wanted to fast forward to the end.  Glad it was a free one for me.,1390262400,,116,3.6
5139218,3,B0087ITBT8,"So.  The mom is portrayed as being very naive which was annoying.  Of course she knows what goes on in a stripper bar.  Of course she knows what goes on in a casino.  Jeez.  Aside from the whole demeaning portrayal of women of a certain age, it was...okay.  nothing special, but not horrible, either.",1390262400,,300,4.462962962962963
5139219,5,B0087ITBT8,Barbara is so cute as the over attentive mom in this movie.  She is perfect in this role.  Really fun movie to watch.,1390262400,,117,4.043478260869565

5139222,3,B0087ITBT8,Cute movie but a little slow at times. Good Son and Mother movie though. I would recommend this movie to everyone.,1390262400,,114,4.476190476190476
5139223,2,B0087ITBT8,"The only reason I watched this movie was because my wife wanted to watch it and even at that she said there was nothing funny about it. My advice, if you have prime membership you can watch it free if not than don't spend any money on it.",1390176000,,238,3.9791666666666665
5139224,3,B0087ITBT8,Cute movie.  I like Barbara Streisand and Seth Rogan.  Movie is corny and predictable at some points but overall fun for comedy,1390176000,,127,4.7272727272727275

5139231,5,B0087ITBT8,"My kids are grown so I made each of them watch this movie with me.  They felt guilty.  I loved it as a mom., The acting was terrific.

5139232,4,B0087ITBT8,"Entertaining and light.  Story was cute, but could have gone much further with comedic results which while adequate were not outstanding.  Good to see Barbara Streisand playing comedy again.",1390176000,,190,5.517241379310345

5139237,3,B0087ITBT8,Not as funny as I anticipated it would be. More of a chick flick than a comedy.  Could be funnier.,1390176000,,98,3.9
5139238,4,B0087ITBT8,"Seth was awesome, and despite my dislike of BS' politics, she did a great job in this movie. Its tough to get a 5-star out of me so the 4-star does carry some weight. It was fun and made you think. Good job on this one!",1390176000,,219,3.782608695652174
5139239,3,B0087ITBT8,"it was a cute movie, but not hilarious. It does poke out some of the reality of family life and we probably could all learn a little about ourselves from this movie. I believe everybody should be able to see parts of themselves in both of the two main characters",1390176000,,262,4.26
5139240,1,B0087ITBT8,Horrible acting and script I see they both were executive producers so maybe they were hoping it would translate better?  We turned it off about a third of the way through.,1390176000,,172,4.548387096774194

5139247,5,B0087ITBT8,"Because I am a mother with a grown son, I really identified with this movie and loved watching it.  It was not just comedy for the sake of laughs; it had an emotional plot line.  Streisand is a wonderful actress.  I would highly recommend it!",1390176000,,242,4.333333333333333
5139248,3,B0087ITBT8,"Film reviewers weren't terribly enthusiastic about this movie. But I decided to watch it anyway. It took a while to really get going, and the set up was a bit unbelievable. But I enjoyed the story and performances nonetheless; Streisand is still such a pro. And the finale was surprisingly moving.",1390176000,,297,4.8431372549019605
5139249,2,B0087ITBT8,"I gave it 20 minutes, then I realized that I can actually turn it off. I would not recommend watching it unless you find being annoyed a funny situation.",1390176000,,153,4.310344827586207

5139251,5,B0087ITBT8,Very entertaining movie. A little emotional at times but more funny. The movie kept me entertained throughout. Both Seth Rogen and Barbara Streisand were great!,1390176000,,160,5.44
5139252,3,B0087ITBT8,"Loved Barbra even if she was overly naggy, but she portrayed what a loving mother quite perfectly.  Seth and Barbra had moments of funny moments, but I found the movie lacked consistency.  It's a cute movie, but not quite enough to get 2 thumbs up.",1390176000,,248,4.488888888888889
5139253,4,B0087ITBT8,"Streisand and Rogen are great together. Barbra never ceases to amaze me with her acting talent...just wish they could have stuck in a song :-) .  I would watch this again.  The ""steak eating"" scene is a classic.",1390176000,,211,4.526315789473684
5139254,4,B0087ITBT8,Funny movie! Better than I expected and as a Prime member I watched it for free. It's a very upbeat movie.,1390176000,,106,4.095238095238095
5139255,3,B0087ITBT8,It was Ok but was the nagging mother of an unmarried son. And it had the expected ending. Glad i waited to view it at home.,1390176000,,123,3.769230769230769
5139258,4,B0087ITBT8,My wife and i loved it.  Not super funny but had a decent story line.  Was worth the time to watch,1390176000,,98,3.619047619047619
5139259,5,B0087ITBT8,Very funny movie. I enjoyed it very much. I will watch it again.. Barbara did well acting in this move. She made a very good mother.,1390176000,,132,4.115384615384615
5139260,5,B0087ITBT8,Just really enjoyed it.it was a good movies and loved that it had closed captions because I'm hard of hearing!,1390176000,,110,4.55
5139261,4,B0087ITBT8,Cute story.  Well done by Barbara and in the end you have a nice moral.  Not a deep movie but one worth watching.,1390176000,,113,3.869565217391304
5139262,5,B0087ITBT8,Absolutely love this movie and laugh out loud moments with lots of tender moments have seen it three times now just love it!!,1390176000,,125,4.478260869565218

5139264,4,B0087ITBT8,Enjoyed it.  Barbara Striesand is always fabulous.  The film was heart warming and entertaining but I know my husband would say it's a chick flick.,1390176000,,147,4.84
5139265,1,B0087ITBT8,"Waste of time! Can't believe I even bothered. Couldnt even finish it, that's how horrible it was to watch. It should get no stars.",1390176000,,130,4.458333333333333
5139266,2,B0087ITBT8,Ok not as funny as it could be. Very predictable  plot. Should have watched the 40 year old virgin again!,1390176000,,105,4.25
5139267,2,B0087ITBT8,"They hint at all kinds of potential jokes that you would expect from this scenario, but they never come. The two main actors are great, Seth is funny, and their is a believable mother, but the script is what makes it fail. They didn't exaggerate enough to make anything funny, and the story is so basic.... Basically the only time i laughed that wasn't due to Seth saving a scene was during the scene they showed in the previews....",1390089600,,432,4.481012658227848
5139268,4,B0087ITBT8,Good comedy with an message about mom and sons relationship. Touching story that was well worth watching. I would recommend to friends.,1390089600,,135,5.181818181818182

5139270,3,B0087ITBT8,"This movie was not the hugely funny movie I expected it to be.  With Streisand in it expected it to be really good, it was so so movie.",1390089600,,135,3.8214285714285716
5139271,4,B0087ITBT8,Streisand and Rogen were great as mother and son very exciting and fun. I wish it was me and my son on this road trip. I love a big steak too!,1390089600,,142,3.6129032258064515
5139272,4,B0087ITBT8,Great watch! Touching story line and gods acting by Seth Rogen and Barbara Streisand. Would recommend this movie to everyone,1390089600,,124,5.25
5139273,1,B0087ITBT8,"I watched the first 10 minutes and realized the majority of the movie consists of dialogue between Streisand and Rogen, so I skipped to the final 10 minutes (still just dialogue) for an anti-climactic ending that made me want to puke. The tag line ""HILARIOUS"" is misleading - this is a slow moving sappy drama. Painful.",1390089600,,319,4.714285714285714
5139274,5,B0087ITBT8,"Excellent movie. Shows BOTH sides of grown children and parents POV. It's funny, dramatic, touching and very eye opening. Barbara Striesand shines. Nice change for Seth Rogen, new avenue for his acting. A mother and son take a road/business trip together and discover the realities of each other's personalities. I loved it!",1390089600,,324,5.25
5139275,3,B0087ITBT8,"It was funny, had some good moments, but didn't grab you in the first few minutes.
Wouldn't say it was bad, but not a favorite.",1390089600,,127,4.12
5139276,1,B0087ITBT8,I couldn't finish watching this. Streisand is always good but her part is so cliched that it's unwatchable. Seth Rogen is also very good but his character is annoying in this movie. Pass it up.,1390089600,,193,4.542857142857143
5139277,1,B0087ITBT8,"I found the movie to be quite boring and uncomfortable to watch. I couldn't even finish it, and that's saying something (bad).",1390089600,,126,4.7727272727272725
5139278,5,B0087ITBT8,"I LOVED this movie.  Mainly because my mother is now dead and I would've rather plucked out my eyeballs than go on a roadtrip with her.  But this is a movie about love and choices and the prickly porcupine way mothers and sons have to navigate sons growing up and dealing with their mothers as human beings and not merely ""Mom"".  At the heart of it, they love each other.  And that is, in my life, a rare thing to watch.  Each tries to love the other the best they know how and at the end of trip, they finally sort of get it.  And that's why I love it.",1390089600,,553,3.981818181818182

5139282,3,B0087ITBT8,"Just So So

It is a alright movie.  At least there is not violence or crudest to it .  So that makes it a better choice than a lot of movie available.  A good movie to pick if you can not find anything else more entertaining or interesting.",1390089600,,240,3.9375
5139283,2,B0087ITBT8,Good actors with a so-so script and lame direction.  I watched it because it was free with Amazon Prime.  Would I pay to watch it?  No.,1390089600,,135,4.115384615384615
5139284,1,B0087ITBT8,Worst movie ever made.  Terrible script.  Nails on a chalkboard.  Id rather sit and give myself paper cuts. Two hours of my life i'd like to get back,1390089600,,149,4.25

5139288,4,B0087ITBT8,Barbara Streisand plays an overbearing mother; great movie.  Very funny to watch the relationship between mom and son.  Worth watching.,1390089600,,135,5.7
5139289,3,B0087ITBT8,Good movie especially since I love Streisand! Different paradigm with funny consequences. Woukd you drive cross country with your mother?,1390089600,,137,5.9
5139290,4,B0087ITBT8,I have two adult sons and laughed at how the mom perceived her sons actions.  They encountered several unexpected situations which kept my interest!,1390089600,,148,5.166666666666667
5139291,2,B0087ITBT8,The movie was boring. A guilt trip from his mom lead to a country wide road trip. All the while she burns his sales pitches and tries a couple of pity parties. Boring. Not really funny either. Needs to be taken out of the comedy section.,1390089600,,237,4.173913043478261
5139292,4,B0087ITBT8,We both like the film.  It had some very funny and human moments.  Typical mother and son conversation and embarrassments.,1390089600,,122,5.05

5139294,4,B0087ITBT8,This movie has Streisand in it which gives it a jump start since she is just as good an actor as she is a singer.  Not sure I would have liked the movie as much had another person played her part.  It is funny but not hilarious as is advertised.  If you like a good clean comedy you will like this movie.,1390089600,,304,3.870967741935484

5139299,5,B0087ITBT8,"I would rate this at four stars, but I gave it five to counter the people who couldn't relate, and who gave it low scores. Seriously, I loved this movie. A doting and possibly overbearing mother, a widow, accompanies her adult, single son (""Why aren't you married?"") on a cross country trip while he pitches his cleaning product to major retailers. Little does she know that he has scheduled their last stop to hopefully rekindle her old flame, an advertising executive in San Francisco. Great stuff.

5139305,1,B0087ITBT8,Rogen and Streisand together sounds like a winner. NOT! This movie I would skip. Both actors are the same in almost every movie. You know the plot early then it is off to the turtle races to get to the end. Too drawn out!,1390003200,,221,4.045454545454546

5139309,2,B0087ITBT8,Very slow until forty min or one hr into the show. Not THAT funny. Foul language unnecessary. Happy with the way it ended.,1390003200,,122,4.3478260869565215
5139310,5,B0087ITBT8,"I loved this movie!  I laughed out loud watching it. Barbra Streisand has always been a favorite of mine and she did not disappoint me in this movie.  Being a mother, I could identify with some of her zany ways but then I could identify with the sons feelings also.  A feel good movie that makes you laugh and sometimes makes you want to cry but in the end makes you feel very good!",1390003200,7,382,4.135135135135135

5139313,3,B0087ITBT8,Not wuite what I expected. But that's just my taste in movies. I took a chance on it. It wasn't horrible just not what I had envisioned. I should've read the reviews better. My bad.,1390003200,,181,4.2
5139314,4,B0087ITBT8,Barbra Streisand is perfect as the doting mom.  The movie has a sweet touch to it in regards to a mother/son relationship.,1390003200,,122,4.545454545454546
5139315,4,B0087ITBT8,"I love Barbara Streisand, so I had to watch. Kind of slow in parts but in the middle to end, it picks up. More of a chick flick I think, I am a ""chick"" so I liked it! Cute movie.",1390003200,,178,3.475
5139316,5,B0087ITBT8,It was a funny heartwarming story. Barbra Streisand was great as usual. I truly loved this movie and would highly reccomend it.,1390003200,,127,4.818181818181818
5139317,2,B0087ITBT8,"I am assuming this is a fictional movie otherwise my rating would be very different.. like zero star.. In fact the title of this movie and knowing it's a parent/child movie... I didn't bother to rent it from a business source because it sounds very destructive. But I watched it here for ""free"" on prime and it's different than I thought it would be and I like the movie okay. ""Hilarious"" is way out of the ball park. This is NOT a hilarious movie. There are a few funny parts though. And yes, Barbra is a great actress and shows through in this movie. The ""son"" actor has some talent, but is drowned by FAR TOO MANY LINES of..... not wanting to hear about sex.
SPOIL ALERT!!!
Only ONE scene did I break out in laughter.. the first clip at the restaurant and her trying to win a free meal. That was very funny. Just only the very beginning showing her at the table.
WAY TOO MUCH FOCUS AND MENTIONING SEX AND HER SON NOT WANTING TO HEAR ABOUT IT. I as a viewer DO NOT WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT EITHER FROM A MOM ENFORCING LISTENING ABOUT SEX TO HER CHILD.... and he obviously was NOT respected on this. This makes Barbra's character latterly insane. And I question how she'd agree to such of a movie.
Regarding a few plots were cleaver... but this movie is way too obscene disgustingly focused on sex... I would NEVER sit down to watch this with my kid nor to a teenager.",1390003200,,1366,4.277992277992278

5139331,5,B0087ITBT8,I did not find it 'tears running down my face' funny but did laugh and enjoyed it VERY much.  I had wanted to watch a TV show and it was the continuation of one I had recorded but seen.  I flipped on my Kindle to see what might interest me there and found this movie sort of spur of the moment.  I was glad to find something that I enjoyed and was able to relax with and not ruin the opportunity to watch the two parts to my TV program in sequence!,1389916800,,448,3.847826086956522

5139336,3,B0087ITBT8,This was a fun movie with some touching scenes.  I think that any mother who adores her grown son(s) will enjoy this movie.  Definitely not anything more than entertaining.,1389916800,,172,4.896551724137931
5139337,3,B0087ITBT8,It was a good movie.  Fun and light.  Made me laugh out loud sometimes. Like Barbara Streisand very much.  Had some serious parts.,1389916800,,130,4.565217391304348
5139338,5,B0087ITBT8,I'm a tough critic and there are few movies that I'm actually happy about the time I spent watching them--this was one. I laughed nonstop throughout this movie. They work so well together and the writing is impeccable as far as what the interaction between a mother and her adult child. Everyone should be able to identify with this movie and find the humor.,1389830400,,358,4.609375
5139339,1,B0087ITBT8,This in my opinion is one of the silliest movies I have ever seen and a total waste if time to watch. If you don't have a strong ability to sit through boredom and a period of time through constant nerve wracking useless chatter ...save your money and stay far far away.,1389830400,,270,4.211538461538462

5139346,3,B0087ITBT8,The acting at time seemed sub par. Not what I would expect from two top notch actors. The writing could have been better. Probably at the heart of the problem. The material was mundane at time and very boring. Knowing what I know now I probably would have not wasted my time watching it.,1389830400,,287,4.333333333333333
5139347,4,B0087ITBT8,"I found the mother-son relationship unique for a movie. This was not a mega comedy with dozens of laughs like you'd expect from Seth Rogan. More of a chick-flick with some humor. But it's entertaining and can jerk your emotions a little. If you like cute comedies, you'll love this.",1389830400,,282,4.66
5139348,4,B0087ITBT8,I enjoyed watching this movie. I found it to be a little slow and not always funny but overall it was worth watching. I even felt like I appreciated my mother more by the end of it.,1389830400,,181,3.918918918918919

5139352,2,B0087ITBT8,Overall I would say its kinda stupid-although I like Ms. Streisand the movie is pointless. I really didn't find anything funny about it,1389830400,,135,4.913043478260869

5139359,2,B0087ITBT8,Perhaps a parent and child don't really get to know each other until the child grows into an adult and circumstances bring them together where they can talk and listen to each other with no place to run away or become distracted.  That's what happens when mother and son take a road trip together in this movie.  Humor is spread throughout but there are many moments along the way that are all too familiar to many of us with children of our own who have grown up way too fast.  This movie is all about re-establishing those communications that help both mom and son to re-connect in a meaningful and loving way.,1389830400,,612,4.446428571428571
5139360,5,B0087ITBT8,"The story is very funny and true, I reflected my relationship with my older son portraid in this movie. I had quite a few laughs and even more chuckles.

Highly recommend to see for Mothers of adolcent and/or ""grown-up"" sons, but do not drag them with you to the movies...",1389830400,,401,4.583333333333333
5139361,4,B0087ITBT8,Great surprise. Weird combo but very funny. A new twist to road trip movie. Barbara Streisand is funny as always and Serh Rogan finally plays a different character,1389830400,,163,4.857142857142857

5139370,2,B0087ITBT8,The beginning of the film was very slow and contained a series of predictable mother/son scenes.  I almost stopped watching the film after the first 20 minutes.  Then their interactions became more interesting as they began to treat each other as adults and individual personalities. They got beyond their long established relationship restrictions and stopped knocking heads and began to work together. They both grew up which was nice to see.,1389830400,,444,5.23943661971831

5139374,4,B0087ITBT8,Funny and poignant. Streisand and Rogen were very good together in this film. Lots of laughs and 'sit-me-downs' between mother and son. Would recommend to anyone who wants to relax and enjoy a good movie without the usual sex and violence.,1389830400,,239,4.853658536585366

I like both Streisand and Rogen and they do make a pretty good combination in this movie.  Some pretty laughable moments that thankfully outnumber the dull ones.  I probably wouldn't watch it a second time, but I would recommend to my friends.",1389830400,,396,4.24

5139383,1,B0087ITBT8,"Could not bear to sit through this. It was simply DREADFUL from start to finish. We were expecting something halfway-decent, especially since Mr. Rogen is usually spot-on as far as his material. But here he is apparently playing second banana to a has-been movie ""star"" from the halcyon days of Hollywood and the whole thing falls disastrously FLAT.

Ms. Streisand is like a human vacuum. She seems to suck up the whole show in a weird way. She has a 'look at me-look at me"" quality, and the director is apparently hypnotized by this. But when we do look at her. . .well. . .so what? She doesn't DO anything. This is acting? It's like they filmed her going about her usual day or something.

Anyway, Rogen=good. Streisand=GODAWFUL. In fact, this is as much a non-performance as the one she gave in ""The Normal Heart.""

BTW-it's not surprising that this turkey didn't garner a single Golden Globe nomination. But most likely the ""star"" has been too busy with costume fittings, rehearsals and pre-recording for ""GYPSY"" that she never even noticed.

5139389,4,B0087ITBT8,"It was nice to see Barbra in a new movie again. Although some parts I think were very predictable and slow.

5139395,4,B0087ITBT8,"This is definitely a chick flick that would include your mom.  That's not a bad thing, just trying to make a point.  I enjoyed this movie, love Barbra so I give it 4 stars.",1389830400,,172,4.029411764705882

Then it got to me.  having three sons of my own, I could only imagine a road trip with all three or just one.  It started out to be a burden, then they learned so much about each other.  It was a positively lovely story and made me jealous.  So much fun to watch.",1389830400,,342,3.898550724637681

5139403,5,B0087ITBT8,I was expecting a cookie cutter type film and got just the opposite. The performances by Barbara and Seth were enjoyable and not at all what I expected. I also felt the story was original and rewarding at the end,1389744000,,212,4.325
5139404,4,B0087ITBT8,"I know the premise is trite and predictable, but I loved this film.  The mother (Streisand) was not as stereotyped as I feared, and I enjoyed the chemistry between she and Rogen.  There was a plot twist I didn't expect, and there were some laugh out loud moments.  The film was touching and sweet.  Sometimes that's all I need.",1389744000,,327,4.491525423728813

5139407,5,B0087ITBT8,I really enjoyed this movie.  Will watch it again.  Such chemistry between the actors.  So true to real life.  Barbra's films are always great.,1389744000,,143,4.833333333333333
5139408,4,B0087ITBT8,I didn't really hold out much hope and I started it with we can always find something else to watch..... but I have to say it was fun and Barbara was really funny.,1389744000,,163,3.9696969696969697
5139409,4,B0087ITBT8,"I was surprised how good this movie was. The movie takes a bit to warm up but the one-liners are pretty funny. It's a goofy funny, light hearted and decent storyline. I would recommend!",1389744000,,185,4.470588235294118
5139410,4,B0087ITBT8,great laugh.  For all the crazy Moms I hope your story turns out as well.  In the mean time call a friend...lol,1389744000,,111,4.0

5139414,4,B0087ITBT8,"There are those who are huge fans of Barbra Streisand's film career, and those who hate her.  Wherever you stand, this movie won't change your mind, but if you enjoy her light comedy acting, this is a reliable watch. Seth Rogen is still Seth Rogen (albeit a bit prudish compared to some of his other stuff...but hey, he's traveling with his mother here).  Though a bit predictable, it's still kind of endearing, and I liked it.",1389744000,,427,4.605263157894737

Not a fan of this one..",1389744000,,301,4.033333333333333
5139427,4,B0087ITBT8,"Seth Rogen does enjoy teaming and playing off others in his past roles.  The idea of him continuing this trait with Barbra Streisand didn't look appealing at all.  I was pleasantly surprised at the interaction between the two, the genuine abilities of both actors, and the relationship teardown and build up which created a therapeutic road-trip journey.  Viewers may find they're taking advice and understanding from this film and applying it to their own relationships.",1389744000,,471,5.253333333333333

5139429,4,B0087ITBT8,"This was a nice surprise. The movie did not get rave reviews when it first came out, but my husband and I thought that the cast alone was worth giving it a try.  The relationship with Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen (as her son) is very believable, both funny and touching.  We're empty nesters now, and Barbra's well-meaning but awkward interference is something our generation can relate to.  Seth was perfect as the long-suffering son, trying so hard to sell his new product on a very important trip to several VIPs across the country.  Of course, both mother and son learn a lot about each other during the long road trip, and they not only grow closer but end up helping each other in unexpected ways.  Maybe it's a generational thing, but whether you identify with Seth or Barbra or are somewhere in between, it's an enjoyable ride.",1389657600,,838,4.635135135135135
5139430,1,B0087ITBT8,"This just didn't compare to other recent road trip movies, i.e. Identity Theft, Hangover, Due Date. It was kind of sad ovedrall.  The main actors should be more selective in their roles.  Yawn.",1389657600,,193,4.818181818181818

Santa Fe must have been to expensive for the movie company to shoot there.  I here it's very pricey.

5139436,2,B0087ITBT8,I did find myself screaming at this stereotypical Jewess mother: shut up already. ; the purpose i presume of  this overstuffed script. Humorous moments could not make up for lackluster  seamless continuity necessary for any road trip movie.  Overdone but nice try.,1389657600,,264,5.238095238095238
5139437,1,B0087ITBT8,"I can only suspect that the people who rated this movie five stars are either family members of the movie's production team, huge fans of Barbra Streisand who missed seeing her on screen for so long that they'd give her five stars in ""Blair Witch 3"" if she starred in it, or big Seth Rogen fans.  The only good thing about this movie is when it finally ends.

Road-trip and buddy movies are difficult to pull off.  If it's also a comedy, then it's even more difficult.  Knowing how to pace the film, throw in enough jokes and gags to keep the story moving, hilarious, and fresh takes a lot of skill.  Unfortunately, this movie simply fell flat from start to finish and everywhere in between.

It seemed like the director wasn't working from a shooting script but a story idea and simply made it up as she went along.  Everything seemed juxtaposed and forced, especially the comedy.  The only way I can see this movie working is if the filmmakers had tossed the whole ""comedy"" approach and, instead, dealt with the film as a coming-of-age story or straight drama.  As is, the movie is just bad.

It is clean, except for one ""F"" bomb, and who doesn't like a smiling ending to a parent/sibling movie?  The reason for a ""Good"" rating instead of ""Great"" is that the script is predictable and there really isn't anything that I would call ""hilarious"".

5139471,4,B0087ITBT8,"Very natural acting makes you believe the mother/son dynamic.  Thoughtful comedy that has a satisfying ending.  Seth Rogen's character curmudgeonly grouses through the entire movie, not exactly endearing himself to viewers.  Sort of redeems himself by the end.  Barbara Streisand as an ""ordinary"" Jewish mother is a bit of a stretch, although they tried to costumer her in a simple way, her real life impairs the believability.  Would recommend this movie as a pleasant way to pass the time without having to invest too much time.",1389657600,,530,5.116279069767442

5139476,3,B0087ITBT8,Funny in a less than funny sort of setting. More about relationship issues and getting to know someone you thought you knew pretty well.,1389657600,,136,4.708333333333333
5139477,4,B0087ITBT8,It was a fun movie and love Barbara Stristrand.  It was funny and showed the  complex family dynamics. Great movie.,1389657600,,115,4.7
5139478,5,B0087ITBT8,A really funny movie and I didn't hear any F bombs in the whole movie. Something you can watch with your parents or kids,1389657600,,120,4.041666666666667

5139481,2,B0087ITBT8,Sorry but did not find it all that funny. cute maybe but not ha ha funny. Nice little movie for those moms who have a son who might not have found his niche yet.,1389657600,,161,3.764705882352941
5139482,3,B0087ITBT8,Seth Rogen is perfect in the story line. Barbara Streisand seems to be trying too hard and is not believable. Story is predictable and at some times too slow.,1389657600,,158,4.482758620689655
5139483,2,B0087ITBT8,"not sure what to say... this movie should have worked better than it did but just didn't somehow.  if you've seen the movie trailer, you've seen the first  half hour of the movie,  During this time period I was left wondering... why am I watching this?  Or is there more to this movie than the trailer?  Short answer is NO, there isn't much more to it than the trailer.  Longer answer is.. well maybe.  All the typical sterotypes (think ""food is love"") are done and done well.  The acting quite good really..but somehow, I couldn't develop any real empathy for either character as they were so far out there as to not be believable.  This might have worked as farce (or camp) but didn't work somehow.  The main story about the love/bond between a mother and son and the chemistry between the two main characters just didn't seem to work all that well.",1389657600,,851,4.503267973856209

5139485,1,B0087ITBT8,Lacked substance. Contrite. Not funny.  Disappointing for Barbara Streisand. I always enjoy her movies. She and Seth Rogan were not a good team.,1389657600,,144,5.260869565217392

5139488,5,B0087ITBT8,This movie so reminds me of how I am sometimes with my son.  Great Movie! Barbara Streisand is her usual funny but top actress self.  Great Movie!,1389657600,,146,4.37037037037037

5139499,3,B0087ITBT8,Cute movie but not much to it.  Gets better as it progresses?  Good if nothing else available.  Actors are believable,1389657600,,117,4.75

5139501,3,B0087ITBT8,"Rambling and slow moving. The plot is thin and stereotypical. The acting was enjoyable but nothing short of dj-vu. Spend 90 minutes for something better. If you like Barbara, you won't mind watching.",1389657600,,199,5.0606060606060606

5139505,4,B0087ITBT8,"My wife and I both enjoyed this movie and found it to be pretty entertaining. It was clean humor for the most part, with only a handful of swear words but the whole story was very believable and relied more on good dialogue than dumb stunts or contrived situations that would never happen.

5139508,2,B0087ITBT8,It says it's a comedy. It isn't really funny. Boring. It's boring. I found myself waiting for it to end about 15 mins into it. I stuck with it expecting it to get better. It didn't. Maybe middle aged women can relate to this and find it funny.,1389657600,,243,4.083333333333333

5139519,4,B0087ITBT8,"Considering the fact I feel that when my son gets older I will be overbearing to him...I really liked this movie. It was really cute for a mother-son movie night. I wouldn't go as far as to say ""HILARIOUS"" like on the cover, but it did have it moments where it was funny. It is a classic relationship movie and there were some twists here and there, but overall I did enjoy it.",1389571200,,377,4.178082191780822

5139522,3,B0087ITBT8,"A charming movie about starting over and being open to new relationships, including reforming old ones (between mother and son).

5139524,5,B0087ITBT8,Very humorous and typical relationship of a Jewish mother and son or perhaps any hovering mother.  Mom was right a lot of the time in her advise.  Thought the actor and actress had good chemistry.  Glad I watched it.,1389571200,,216,4.487179487179487

5139535,3,B0087ITBT8,"This movie has a lot of ""typical"" mother-son interactions, some spot on that I smiled about (I have a 30 year old son) - but others that are just typical of a mother who is overeager to see her son well settled - read: married.  I like both the main characters in this movie; they play well off each other.  Barbara Streisand is a great actress in her own way, truly an amazing woman, too.  And this movie fits her personality well.

Three stars only, though, because of at least one F-bomb and the strip club scene which I skipped over.  Don't see why either of these two things were really needed in the movie.  But I guess that's why it is rated PG-13.  I don't trust PG-13 movies to be F-bomb free or not tacky (strippers) any more, and this movie just proves my point.

Not a family movie - definitely more for a more mature audience who can appreciate the interactions between an older mother and her grown son.

Barbara Streisand looks great, by the way.  Fun to see such a great example of never getting ""old!""  She rocks! :-)",1389484800,,1034,4.333333333333333

I loved how the movie allowed the two to find a way to realize that they both actually really loved each other. The son learns a lot about his mother that he didn't know about, and is endeared by it. He realizes how much his mother truly loves him, and that the relationship between them is so important. It's a very good story, with great acting. Streisand is really good in her role.

5139555,4,B0087ITBT8,Cute! Love Seth and Barbara. I don't think I would purchase but was great to watch one time while cooking dinner.,1389484800,,113,4.428571428571429
5139556,3,B0087ITBT8,"I enjoyed it..I thought it would be more funny though and less sentimental. Overall I reccomend it, why not! Thanks",1389484800,,115,4.8
5139557,4,B0087ITBT8,I'm a mom of 3 young men so this made me laugh and cry.  This is a fun winter night movie to just sit back and enjoy by the fire!,1389484800,,129,3.3
5139558,4,B0087ITBT8,My girlfriend (who was so the doting mother in the movie) was too busy laughing to finish telling me how stupid it was.,1389484800,,119,4.217391304347826
5139559,3,B0087ITBT8,Was pleasantly surprised at this movie. Good to see Barbra Streisand again. Many predictable situations but still worth watching as a rental,1389484800,,140,5.409090909090909
5139560,4,B0087ITBT8,"Good movie, entertaining, but not a big fan of Seth Rogen.  Barbra Streisand was great as the stereotypical Jewish Mother.  The plot was too predictable and dropped the ancillary theme at the end.

Not a bad choice for movie day/night on Prime, but won't pay to buy it.",1389484800,,269,4.5625
5139561,5,B0087ITBT8,"When I saw the previews I expected this to be a typical Seth Rogen comedy, although it wasn't really what I expected, I still loved the movie.  It is funny, I chuckled throughout, but it was more a sweet, emotional mother-son movie.",1389484800,,232,4.523809523809524
5139562,1,B0087ITBT8,Hard to believe you could put two talented people in this movie and come up with such a disaster. Stay away.,1389484800,,108,4.190476190476191
5139563,4,B0087ITBT8,"I could see and hear myself saying so many of the things that Barbra said to her son, if I were to take a trip with my son.  A good movie with a lot of laughs.",1389484800,,159,3.4166666666666665
5139564,4,B0087ITBT8,Nice to see Barbara Streisand back in the movies.  Its realistic in a bizzard kind of way.  Wouldn't buy it.,1389484800,,108,4.35
5139565,3,B0087ITBT8,"I liked this movie but was annoyed buy the character played by Barbara Streisand, It was funny to an extent but not worth seeing again.",1389484800,,135,4.44
5139566,4,B0087ITBT8,"Funny and real, that's how I describe this movie. The restaurant/contest segment is really the only part that I had trouble with believing, but I guess not impossible. I really enjoyed it and would watch it again.",1389484800,,213,4.783783783783784
5139567,1,B0087ITBT8,"It was labeled hilarious but to me there was nothing funny about the entire movie. It appeared to be failure son, and his overbearing mother trying to take a trip together to mend some fences. It took waaay too long to move into the body of the movie and then swooped out of anything that could have been developed into something good. It just didn't work for me as a comedy.",1389484800,,375,4.295774647887324
5139568,3,B0087ITBT8,"The movie was funny and acting good, but the story plot just ok, some of the scenes too far fetched that it lost my interest a little, still a good movie to stream.",1389484800,,164,4.0
5139569,3,B0087ITBT8,"Not sure if Seth Rogan was the best choice to play Barbara Streisand's son.
Actually his body language was appropriate in some of the scenes but at
other times it appeared awkward. Streisand hasn't lost any of her comedy
appeal as far as my wife and I are concerned but the comedy would have
been better if she could have played off of someone with someone with more
energy. Actually in real life we could see this relationship actually existing
but as a comedy another son would have been a better choice.",1389484800,,506,4.510869565217392

5139584,4,B0087ITBT8,"Definitely a ""chick flick""; not sure my husband would have watched this one with me.  I have always liked Barbara Streisand and she continues to be an amazing actor and was great in this movie as well.  I thought the chemistry between the two was great.",1389484800,,253,4.478260869565218
5139585,4,B0087ITBT8,"Going cross country, to run away from problems can become heavy, serious. But, the actors keep this rolling and truly entertaining. One feels the pain of disclosing big things from parents, only to have it trickle out in unexpected conversation. I could watch this a second time.",1389484800,,279,4.957446808510638
5139586,3,B0087ITBT8,"I hit the ""ONE"" (1) star by mistake.  Would have chosen THREE  (3).  While this is a cute little
flick, it is kind of an OK film.  Director likes those close ups and unremarkable one liners.
Seth Rogen - splendid passive job of the all too much smothering mom.",1389484800,,260,4.244897959183674
5139587,4,B0087ITBT8,I love Barbra Streisand! I got some good chuckles out of this movie. She did a really good job with the parent role and could represent many mothers around the world. Seth Rogan paired well with her!,1389484800,,199,4.405405405405405

5139589,5,B0087ITBT8,"I can understand why some of the reviews said it was slow or boring-especially if you can't relate to the plot.  However, me being an only child and who has lost a parent, this movie really tugged at my heartstrings!...Especially since my mom and I took a road trip a couple years after my dad passed away-and believe me, the writers were pretty realistic when it comes to the drama associated with that.  Haha.  I would strongly suggest anyone to watch this movie.  Sometimes we forget how precious the ones closest to us are and get annoyed all too easily at the ones we have left.  This movie says all of the things that I've felt over the past few years and more.  Great job!",1389398400,,679,4.392
5139590,5,B0087ITBT8,It was a good movie and very intrasting. And it was very funny because it has good acters and it reminds me of my mother,1389398400,,120,3.84
5139591,2,B0087ITBT8,"Me and my girlfriend saw this movie, and are both puzzled that it is considered a comedy. If you love to laugh and want to laugh, watch something else. This is more of a drama than anything. If it was labeled a drama, it would probably get 3 1/2 stars.",1389398400,4,252,4.06
5139592,3,B0087ITBT8,"If I could give it a 3.5, I would. It's pretty predictable, but the story and characters hit home... Funny and heartwarming add to the mix.",1389398400,,139,4.384615384615385

I enjoyed going on this road trip with the Brewster's, watching as Seth Rogen's character finally gets to know his mother as a person. I laughed and I think I shed a tear or two. I found this to be a heart-warming movie, that left me satisfied with the ending.",1389398400,,430,4.320987654320987
5139597,4,B0087ITBT8,"Not much of an acting stretch for Streisand as she's playing a overbearing Jewish mother.  Good chemistry between Seth Rogan and her. Although the movie is somewhat of a typical road trip movie, the ending has a nice twist and makes your investment in this movie worth your time",1389398400,,278,4.673469387755102
5139598,3,B0087ITBT8,The story was rather slow but at least it wasn't filled with dirty language and smut.  Not sure how they made it around the country in the time they claimed to in the movie.,1389398400,,173,4.088235294117647
5139599,3,B0087ITBT8,"This is a cute movie.  Not as funny as I thought it would be but nevertheless it had moments.  Put it on your watch list and when you want a few laughs put it on.

5139600,3,B0087ITBT8,"Barbara Streisand never disappoints and I'm a huge fan...any movie with her in it I will watch. Seth Rogen was OK. While Streisand disappears into the ""mom"" role, for me, I kept seeing Seth Rogen, not ""the son"". It was like watching Seth Rogen watching himself acting... or something.

See it for Streisand. I didn't laugh much....perhaps the script could've been funnier.",1389398400,,372,5.0

5139603,3,B0087ITBT8,"A movie that appeals to a certain niche of people. Mostly single parents of an upper-class or upper-middle class status. Emotional and dramatic with a few laughs that explores the relationship between a book-smart son and a common-sense mom. Felt monotone to me, but i was still curious about the ending which was satisfying but didn't justify the amount of time spent watching the movie.",1389398400,,388,4.984615384615385

5139643,4,B0087ITBT8,I liked it. It has some good laughs but has serious moments as well and I think everyone can relate to the son or daughter/mother relationship that's going on in the movie.,1389312000,,172,4.40625

5139645,5,B0087ITBT8,Very entertaining movie! Our family very much enjoyed watching. Barbra Streisand was exceptional in this film. Heart warming comedy. Enjoy!!,1389312000,,140,6.05
5139646,5,B0087ITBT8,"Streisand the comedienne at her best, don't miss it.  Psychological aspect is interesting and well developed.  Script and exquisite timing of the actors keeps the film moving at a fast pace.  Five stars",1389312000,,202,5.0606060606060606
5139647,4,B0087ITBT8,I really enjoyed the humor and characters in this movie. It was cleaner and much more family friendly than most of Rogen ' s movies and Streisand was an excellent doting mother. I was pleasantly surprised that Rogen ' s character didn't use drugs in this movie,1389312000,,260,4.553191489361702
5139648,5,B0087ITBT8,Great movie. Funny and interesting. Would recommend it to others. Well acted and written. The characters work well together. Enjoyed.,1389312000,,133,5.7
5139649,5,B0087ITBT8,"Its not very often that I like a comedy, but this one was actually pretty good. Also, it's kind of refreshing to have any kind of movie that's about love but not romance. If you're looking for slapstick, this isn't it, but if you're looking for the kind of movie that's funny because you can relate, this is for you.",1389312000,,316,4.283333333333333
5139650,4,B0087ITBT8,I like Barbra and have seen her in other movies.  This was a very nice mother/son trip to witness.  At points it brought tears to my eyes. However I can't imagine why anyone would take such a long road...lol.,1389312000,,208,4.3076923076923075
5139651,4,B0087ITBT8,"It is  charming duet of still beautiful Barbra Streisand and a bit clumsy Seth Rogen.

5139652,4,B0087ITBT8,A week long trip across the US with MY son?  Count me in!  This is a very good movie with a happy ending.  I love to see Barbra Streisand on the big screen!  And you can never go wrong with Seth Rogen,1389312000,,200,3.6904761904761907
5139653,4,B0087ITBT8,Good movie and completely realistic.  Whether it's Jewish. .Italian... or Any other nationality  depiction of a loving  crazy mother! Funny and sensitive!,1389312000,,154,5.909090909090909

5139657,3,B0087ITBT8,"Fairly cute movie.  Predictable  and cliche.  Seemed a bit beneath both of its main stars, Rogen  and Streisand.  Not as funny as I'd  hoped,  given  its  two top stars  and some of the supporting actors.",1389312000,,204,4.571428571428571
5139658,4,B0087ITBT8,I loved it !  I thought it was a great movie.  I loved the relationship between Seth & Barbara.  I can absolutely see that as a real relationship...lol  I did think it dragged a little in middle...other than that it was great & I would recommend & did to a friend.,1389312000,,264,4.117647058823529

5139661,4,B0087ITBT8,"When I watched this movie I was not expecting it to be that great. A lot of comedies these days are all the same and play out all of the same ideas, stereotypes, characters, etc. However, I am a huge fan Seth Rogen and enjoy most of the movies he is in. I think he has a ""nonchalant"" way of being funny that can easily be overlooked. When his attitude is mixed with Barbra and her over-the-top attitude, it works nicely! I feared that the movie would would leave Barbra without real depth and only concentrate its efforts on Rogen's character development. I was pleasantly surprised when this was not the case! Barbra demands attention and respect in this movie and I loved that. Rogen also works his charm. This movie really depicts the importance of compromise and understanding when it comes to family relationships!!",1389225600,,820,4.662068965517242
5139662,4,B0087ITBT8,"It was a good funny movie.  Barbra is always great!  I kept hoping she would break into song though!  Which she does not do.  Some parts seem a little slow, but you just have to ""wait for it"", cuz it is a good funny story.",1389225600,,222,3.8666666666666667
5139663,5,B0087ITBT8,This movie was fun to watch. It was my first experience with the Amazon Prime iPad app. It worked great.,1389225600,,104,4.25
5139664,5,B0087ITBT8,I really liked this movie.  It was so close to a parent/ adult child relationship.  It is also a movie I could easily watch with my mom without being embarrassed.,1389225600,,162,4.366666666666666
5139665,5,B0087ITBT8,I loved this movie!  Laughed so hard and have told several people who have son's to watch it.  It was a minute by minute recap of my time with my son when we are together.  Mother's just want to help.  Sometimes they even know best!  Great movie!,1389225600,,246,4.148936170212766
5139666,4,B0087ITBT8,"Very enjoyable movie.  Some laugh out loud moments as well as some touching ones.  Wish Barbra would make more movies, she is a very good actress.",1389225600,,146,4.576923076923077
5139667,4,B0087ITBT8,It wasn't as slapstick as I thought it might be. It's no academy award winner but endearing and entertaining enough.,1389225600,,116,4.85

5139670,1,B0087ITBT8,I just didn't get hooked and brought into the movie. Some might enjoy the film others will probably say its a bit cliche. You can watch it because you like the actors. However if you really want to be entertained I'd recommend that you can find something better to watch.,1389225600,,271,4.44
5139671,2,B0087ITBT8,Very slow moving. I did not enjoy this movie. Barbra should have really read the script before agreeing to do this. Very disappointing,1389225600,,134,4.869565217391305
5139672,5,B0087ITBT8,Great movie and great chemistry between these two funny people.  Nice to see Barbara again... I miss seeing her and wish she would do more.,1389225600,,139,4.56
5139673,4,B0087ITBT8,"This film was entertaining and enjoyable. I did however find it hard to believe that Seth Rogen was such a learned person, not because I think he is an idiot, but more because he still played that 35 year old stoner type. It was a bit distracting. Overall a decent movie.",1389225600,,271,4.333333333333333
5139674,3,B0087ITBT8,The movie was great and I very much enjoyed the inexpensive price that Amazon Prime Instant video's offered to see it!,1389225600,,118,4.666666666666667
5139675,5,B0087ITBT8,"A sweet movie with lots of laughs. My wife loved it. I had not seen Barbara Streisand since ""The Way We Were"" and this reminded me of how good she is. The scene at the steakhouse is just beautiful.",1389225600,,197,4.076923076923077
5139676,4,B0087ITBT8,I liked this movie. Simple and not complicated at all. Barbra Streisand is funny without being annoying. Easy to watch and keeps you with a smile on your face.,1389225600,,159,4.517241379310345
5139677,4,B0087ITBT8,"Fun story, good acting.  Was just a nice little movie to watch when nothing good was on TV.

5139678,5,B0087ITBT8,"Better than the trailers would have you believe.  The trailers did this movie an injustice making it appear to be something it is not. This actually had a interesting story that wasn't just a vehicle for the stars.

I wouldn't say it is 'Hilarious' as the tag lines say, . . . But, it is fun and worth watching.

Obviously, if you had a like either Streisand or Rogan you will enjoy it.",1389225600,,386,4.260273972602739
5139679,3,B0087ITBT8,"While it starts out as a sometimes road trip from hell, it ends up being a sweet tale of how much they love and care about each other. It features lot's of verbal sparring between the two lead actor's and as you would expect, they get on each other's nerves now and then. But in the end Seth Rogen does something very sweet for his Mom. Barbara Steisand doesn't overdo the Jewish mother routine and has many nice moments with her son. I enjoyed this movie.",1389225600,,456,4.313953488372093

5139682,5,B0087ITBT8,I thought it was going to be a stupid movie but turned out to be very funny and so so true of a loving mother. A must see if you have adult children.,1389225600,,149,3.5454545454545454
5139683,2,B0087ITBT8,"I usually like any family oriented movies, but this one just annoys me, especially how the mother played by barbra s, got upset when she found out the reason why the son invited her for the road trip.

5139684,3,B0087ITBT8,Movie was a little less than average. Unable to give it 2.5 stars so gave it 3.  There were definitely scenes that could have been cut.,1389225600,,135,4.1923076923076925

5139704,4,B0087ITBT8,"This movie is probably a movie to watch with friends who really love Barbra Streisand. She is funny, and as always really makes the movie. Any movie that Barbra makes is well worth seeing. And for that matter, since this is a new film vehicle for her, I would have to say I really loved it. It entails a Mother - son relationship, and the pitfalls involved in having a somewhat overbearing parent. Sure at times the story line is a little thin (henceforth, only four stars), but the ending of the movie really hits home. Again, I adore Barbra Streisand, so I may be a little partial. Either way, see the film, it's full of jokes, and yet some real serious acting scenes by the Babs.",1389139200,,682,4.377952755905512
5139705,4,B0087ITBT8,"""The Guilt Trip"" is a nice family drama about a mother and son who take a road trip together.  The humor hits a little close to home, since it plays on predictable tensions in a family.  The movie depicts growth in the characters, but it's not extraordinary or impossible given the circumstances.  Streisand and Rogen do a great job.  There is some adult humor (a punch to the face, an unintended and unwelcome trip to a strip club, although there is no nudity nor any outright explanation of what is going on there, and an audiobook about hermaphrodites), which might not be appropriate for children under 13.",1389139200,,610,4.672897196261682

I actually put it on while making dinner and I kept hearing really good parts in the movie so I continued to prep my meals for the week and decided that when my fiance came down we would watch it together. So glad that I did! It ended up being a great movie that made me appreciate my mom. And LOVED the scene of him describing his chemistry experiments. A great tribute to moms who always put their kids first and a great movie about how kids want their parents to be happy too. Even if it means lying about how great they are doing! Super sweet!,1389139200,,618,4.158333333333333

5139732,5,B0087ITBT8,"This movie was a ""mom movie"" 100%. Barbra Streisand still looks good from every camera angle, and can act better than most actresses today. Rogen was hilarious, and his personality fit the script perfectly. I cried several times during the movie. I would watch it again.",1389139200,,270,4.891304347826087
5139733,4,B0087ITBT8,I would certainly recommend this movie to my friends.  It was funny and sad and realistic.  All adults would relate to the story line,1389139200,,133,4.5

NO FREE SHIPPING....tried using 'amazon prime' to watch television series I may have missed or movies that I want to catch up on....well there are only 2 tv series you can watch for free on prime all others cost $$$, just like the movies, there are a myriad listed on 'prime' however, the majority are not free and cost $$$...What a ripe off..............",1389139200,,581,4.490566037735849

5139741,3,B0087ITBT8,We all get stubborn with admitting our parents might be right even why they're being annoying or seemingly out of touch.  This story is touching and funny.,1389139200,,155,4.7407407407407405
5139742,5,B0087ITBT8,This was way better than I thought it would be. I really enjoyed it and was glad I took the time to watch it,1389139200,,108,3.5416666666666665
5139743,5,B0087ITBT8,"I liked this movie! Every now and then I want to sit back and have a few laughs and not see people getting blown to pieces. Soooo sick of violence and mayhem. The story was simple and the actors wonderful. I love Paul Rudd- he was the perfect foil to Ms Streisand ( who I haven't seen in a movie in years). She is amazing, as usual. So nice, the whole thing! A pleasure to see a movie that isn't full of swearing and gunfire.",1389139200,,425,4.011764705882353

5139748,4,B0087ITBT8,Babs does such a good job of portraying the nagging mother that I almost gave up on it but then the huge blow up & both she & her son do a turn around with a happy ending. Good movie!,1389139200,,183,3.6
5139749,3,B0087ITBT8,"Thought provoking and entertaining overall.  There were some funny moments that made my wife and I laugh, but there were too many times the movie seemed to dwell on some parts too long.",1389139200,,185,4.606060606060606
5139750,3,B0087ITBT8,"The movie was entertaining and I believe it was free of any smut.  Seth Rogen was perfect for his character that was aloof and basically just humored his mother.  Barbara Streisand was good as the neurotic and overbearing mother.  In the end, all worked out well.  I am giving this 3 1/2 stars.",1389139200,,294,4.490566037735849

5139754,5,B0087ITBT8,Barbara Streisand never lets me down.  Her humor and energy level is the best.  I highly recommend this - you won't  be disappointed,1389139200,,132,4.6521739130434785

5139757,5,B0087ITBT8,"Streisand was great, she looked so good I kind of found myself wondering, ""how can she look so good?"".  It was a very entertaining movie.  I found it to be realistically funny, not bust your gut laughing out loud funny.  It was so good to watch a movie without crazy computer graphics that actually had a human story to it.  A good story is still the best entertainment.  Seth Rogen was great.

I find myself rooting for Streisand as I like it when famous talented people can voluntarily retire or semi retire and live a relatively ordinary life.  Yet you always wonder what tremendously talented people could have done if they didn't retire.",1389052800,,642,4.628318584070796

5139759,5,B0087ITBT8,"Wanted a light-hearted movie on a cold weekend night, love Seth Rogan, and figured I'd give it a shot. Loved every bit of this movie. As a new mom, and having a mother of my own who tends to be a bit ""involved"", I could relate to the dynamics of the relationship between Seth and Barbara Streisand. Their characters are extremely vulnerable, relatable, and fresh. The movie takes you on a road trip full of laughs, stories and family dynamics. Would highly recommend to anyone with a heart and a sense of humor. Hope a sequel is made! I'll be calling my mom after this!",1389052800,,569,4.428571428571429

I laughed, and I cried, I got super annoyed, and had a little warm fuzzy feeling. I don't normally write reviews on anything, but this movie was that good. Joyce totally reminded me of my own mother.",1389052800,,316,4.372881355932203

5139778,4,B0087ITBT8,I may be biased because in addition to loving Barbara Streisand I am also a mom with two grown sons.  Could definitely relate to a lot of scenes in the movie.  Very cute comedy,1389052800,,176,4.147058823529412

5139790,3,B0087ITBT8,"A comedy with peaks and lulls of humor, with some deep underlying character issues that I'm not sure we're fully realized through out the movie.  While entertaining, it was not hilarious or overly dramatic but I would watch it again.",1388966400,,233,4.825
5139791,2,B0087ITBT8,"First off, this movie pretty much was slammed by critics.  That said, if you are a fan of either of the two stars and are in the mood for a mindless piece of fluff, you might enjoy this film.  I watched it one night after a long day of work and found it amusing and good enough to watch until the end.
The premise is , Barbra Streisand goes on a road trip with her son, Seth Rogan, a scientist in pursuit of a company to buy his new, ecologically sound cleaning solution.  Beware - Since Streisand refused to leave Los Angeles, there are a lot of 'green screen' shots of the two of them standing in front of backgrounds like the Grand Canyon, etc.  To me, that was the worst part.  But, Streisand is her usual fun self and Rogan is believable as the off-beat son.
If you are not a fan of either star, you will most likely hate it.  But if, like me, you like these actors and you don't have high expectations, this is a silly, fun romp across America.",1388966400,,950,4.135869565217392
5139792,4,B0087ITBT8,Great movie. The combination of Rogen and Streisand was great. Had a good storyline to the movie. Will watch again.,1388966400,,115,4.8

5139794,4,B0087ITBT8,I enjoyed this movie very much. It was an entertaining exploration of a mother - son relationship. Rogen and Streisand have great chemistry and and really perform well together. I love that the movie has a believable theme and that the interactions between the characters feel so real. Awesome date movie!,1388966400,,305,5.0
5139795,4,B0087ITBT8,"I think many people went into this movie expecting it be like other Seth Rogen movies. It ended up being much better than I was expecting. This move is very heartwarming and sentimental. It's the perfect movie to see with one of your parents.

When the movie first starts out we are introduced to Seth Rogen's character, Andrew. He's an inventor who has come up with a new organic cleaning product. He embarks on a cross country road trip to pitch his new product to various companies throughout America. Before he sets out he decides to visit his mother Joyce, played by Barbra Streisand. He asks her if she wants to come along after she tells him about a former lover she used to have. He ends up finding that the former lover is living in San Fransisco now and unmarried. He does not tell her about this and assures her he just wants her to come with to ""spend some time"" with him.

The movie has it's typical road trip cliches, random bad weather, car trouble, sight seeing, etc. There are parts where you just want to punch Seth Rogen in the face because he's being immature and rude to his mother but you need to keep watching because it's all apart of the story line and makes the last half all worth it. This movie really shows the bond mother and child (at any age) can really have. I'm glad I took a chance on this movie and can see myself watching it again, this time with my parents.",1388966400,,1395,4.340996168582375

5139802,4,B0087ITBT8,This movie was more touching than funny. Barbra Streisand did an exceptional job with her character.

5139810,4,B0087ITBT8,"I did not expect much from Guilt Trip. I was surprised at how well Streisand and Rogan fit together. Their conversations are great. The story is kind of a ""feel good"" journey and has a nice coming of age ending. I actually really liked it.",1388966400,,239,4.333333333333333
5139811,5,B0087ITBT8,Loved this movie. Streisand and Rogan are great together. Funny story with the right amount of mushy mom love. Get it.,1388966400,,118,4.666666666666667
5139812,3,B0087ITBT8,Funny but not unusually so.  The movie is recommended but not one of the best that we have seen in the past.,1388966400,,108,3.909090909090909
5139813,3,B0087ITBT8,"The title would suggest that the mother was giving the son a constant guilt trip. That was not the case. A few inappropriate ""jokes"" by the son and too many unfortunate close-ups with Barbara who has aged marginally, I'm so sorry to say because she has incredible vocal talent.",1388966400,,277,4.673469387755102
5139814,3,B0087ITBT8,"The Jewish mother thing wore thin early on and there were several amusing moments none were really laughing out loud funny. Still, it was a good plot and enjoyable movie.",1388966400,,170,4.7

5139816,4,B0087ITBT8,"Totally can relate to the overbearing mother played by B Streisand. Have one of my own, mo-n-law. God bless her soul but a lot of the times over edge.

5139817,3,B0087ITBT8,A lot more hype than it really is. I was expecting a lot more jokes and more of a story line. Very predictable.,1388966400,,111,3.869565217391304
5139818,4,B0087ITBT8,Very poignant movie which addresses family issues and dynamics by utilizing drama and comedy.  Would definitely be willing to see it again,1388966400,,138,5.2727272727272725

5139821,3,B0087ITBT8,The movie starts slow and gradually takes traction. Has a feel good factor throughout the story - the slight twist in the climax towards the end is quite unpredictable.,1388966400,,168,4.827586206896552

5139823,5,B0087ITBT8,"I watched the movie because it was free in Prime and I was up late at night (insomnia).  I wasn't expecting much even though I love Barbra Streisand and enjoy Seth Rogen's low-key style.  To my surprise, I thoroughly enjoyed it and plan to watch it again.  Streisand was perfection as the mother.  I honestly forgot that it was her because her character was so enjoyable and real.  She was great at the comedic parts (isn't she always?) and very heartbreaking in the dramatic scenes.  My heart ached for her during those scenes.  She was amazing.  Rogen was wonderful and believable as the son.  He is funny without having to work at it.  He was very believable during the awkward, emotional moments when he and his mother had conflict or painful moments.  I watched the movie just to watch a movie.  I will watch it again to enjoy this film.  Watch it.  You will be moved.  It has too many moments that share emotions with real life that we all will empathize with.  Wonderful film.",1388966400,,983,4.531428571428571

5139825,5,B0087ITBT8,"I kept thinking that I know this gal.  I didn't realize until at the end of the movie, that Barbara Streisand starred in this movie.  She had a fantastic performance in this movie.  She performed the part of mom very well.  I'd recommend the movie to anyone.",1388880000,,258,4.425531914893617
5139826,4,B0087ITBT8,any Jewish kid can relate to this movie. and who does not love a  little bit of Barbara Steisand! Yeees!,1388880000,,104,4.2
5139827,5,B0087ITBT8,"I loved it so much!
A story of family love, nobody loves you like your mother does, and nobody will. Its a funny and very clever story of how Mom is always right.",1388880000,,162,3.9393939393939394
5139828,5,B0087ITBT8,This was a fun movie to watch because of the often amusing and always realistic dialogue between mother and son.  I loved it so much I watched the movie twice.  It is so great to see a movie based on a mother/ adult son relationship for a change.,1388880000,,246,4.104166666666667
5139829,4,B0087ITBT8,"Watched the movie with the wife via Prime streaming service, while it is predictable we had a few laughs. Rogen and Streisand make a good team",1388880000,,142,4.5
5139830,1,B0087ITBT8,It took alot to capture my interest. I love seth rogan as an actor but this was def a flop of his in my book. i know he can do much much better,1388880000,2,143,3.3636363636363638

5139832,4,B0087ITBT8,"This film was recommended by my friend and I was skeptical I would like it.  I decided to view it anyway and I am very happy I did.  I am not a big Striesand fan but she was great in this film.  Some of her acting was a little over the top but it all evened out over the course of the film.  It's a buddy movie, a family commentary, and a travel flick all in one.  It's a cute, watchable move that anyone will enjoy.  I wasn't rolling on the floor laughing but the movie was bemusing enough for me and I am a tough audience.",1388880000,,524,3.850467289719626
5139833,4,B0087ITBT8,"Okay, call me sappy - but I found this to be a really sweet movie.  I know, that's not much of a recommendation, so sue me.  Don't let that fact that it would wrench my heart out stop you.  Don't let the fact that it could bring shame on my family for generations...and my dear, sweet, sainted mother would have dyspepsia!  Noooooo....don't worry about me...I'll get by.  In the cold.  In shame.  Listening to the echoes of your criticism.  It's okay.  Really.

So you'll watch it, yes?",1388880000,,486,4.482758620689655
5139834,3,B0087ITBT8,Slow starting but got better towards the end. It wasn't hilarious yet it gave me some time to be with family.,1388880000,,109,4.238095238095238
5139835,5,B0087ITBT8,I did not expect much from this movie but found it very funny.  A fun movie that I would recommend.,1388880000,,99,3.95

5139837,3,B0087ITBT8,A silly funny movie about a guy going on a road trip with his mother.  He's trying to sell a product and have his mom meet the old boy friend she named him for.  She wants to get him back in touch with old girlfriends. Predictable mayhem ensues. Seth Rogen and Barbra Streisand are believable in their relationship with each other. Nice way to pass the time.,1388880000,,358,4.3283582089552235
5139838,4,B0087ITBT8,"I think if anyone has a caring but nagging mom, they can relate!  Barbara really made the movie funny, Seth was okay.  It's a good rainy day movie for a few chuckles.",1388880000,,166,4.15625
5139839,3,B0087ITBT8,A little slow but had its moments. Barbara Streisand was great. An ok movie for when you have watched all the new stuff out there.,1388880000,,130,4.24

5139841,3,B0087ITBT8,This movie is more of a softcore comedy film. The movie has its cute soft and semi funny moments. 3 stars.,1388880000,,106,4.095238095238095
5139842,4,B0087ITBT8,Really cute movie! I think a lot of 20 somethings can relate to some parts of this movie. Great for a lazy day.,1388880000,,111,3.869565217391304
5139843,5,B0087ITBT8,The movie portrays a relationship between a (single) mother and son's relationship later in life - warts and all with humor. You will find yourself relating to both characters. Great Job!!,1388880000,,188,5.096774193548387
5139844,4,B0087ITBT8,I really enjoy this movie to the poiint that when it ended I did not realize that the almost 2 hour movie was over. It is about a mother and son taking a trip. I do not want to spoil the story but it is very sweat movie about relations between son and Mother. I just love Barbra Shreisand so I am bias about it!!,1388880000,,312,3.8153846153846156
5139845,5,B0087ITBT8,I have never been a big Striesand fan until this movie. One of the best performances from a actress I've ever saw.,1388880000,,114,4.2272727272727275
5139846,2,B0087ITBT8,The movie is slow and mostly dull.  One or two chuckles.  I would suggest anyone looking for a good laugh look elsewhere.,1388880000,,121,4.454545454545454
5139847,3,B0087ITBT8,it was an okay movie.  Fine to have on while doing grading.  Streisand and Rogen were good.  Story was a little thin. But worth watching for free from prime.,1388880000,,157,4.344827586206897
5139848,1,B0087ITBT8,Barbara is so much better than this garbage.  Surely there's a great script out there for her level of talent.  She still looks great.,1388880000,3,134,4.541666666666667
5139849,1,B0087ITBT8,"Thought this might be a funny movie, wrong. Lasted about a half hour and just couldn't take anymore. I thought it was just me, but when I looked over to my wife, even she had enough.",1388880000,3,182,4.083333333333333
5139850,4,B0087ITBT8,"Love Seth Rogan and hadn't seen Barbara Streisand in a movie in decades. She not only looks utterly amazing, but her performance was top notch. Not only was this entertainingly funny, it was also quite poignant as far as relationships go. I highly recommend it!",1388880000,,261,4.822222222222222
5139851,5,B0087ITBT8,"Guilt trip was a very fun, enjoyable movie. Nothing serious, but a good message about relationships. Highly recommend it for everyone.",1388880000,,134,5.428571428571429
5139852,5,B0087ITBT8,Enjoyed this look at a mother/son relationship.  Both leads did a great job.  Barbara S. was wonderful once again as an overbearing Jewish mother (Meet the Parents II).  Her sense of comedy is good and she doesn't overplay it.  This movie is well worth spending the time to watch.,1388880000,,280,4.653061224489796
5139853,4,B0087ITBT8,Surprisingly funnier than I thought it would be. I really enjoyed the connection between mother and son and it's final outcome.,1388880000,,127,5.095238095238095
5139854,5,B0087ITBT8,I would give anything to go on a road trip with my son. It was funny yet had a serious side that I could really relate to.  Well done!,1388880000,,134,3.6206896551724137
5139855,1,B0087ITBT8,"The opening did not engage me.  I lost interest and did not watch it beyond the first 20 minutes.  It was very boring to me, but others may enjoy.  Just not my type of entertainment.",1388880000,3,182,4.142857142857143
5139856,3,B0087ITBT8,Very true son/mother relationships displayed.  Mother doting on son because the love she has for him is so instense she makes a fool of herself.  I've heard tell this is true with jewish mothers and most mothers.  This mother would do anything for the love of her son.  The son loves his mother but the mother seems to embarrass the heck out of him without even trying.  Good for men to see how mothers love is great.,1388880000,,417,4.363636363636363
5139857,5,B0087ITBT8,"I feel although it wasn't as comedic as I expected it to be, I loved it. Great acting and it definitely makes you look at the relationship between mothers and their (now grown up) kids from both points of view. I look forward to taking a vacation with my mom soon!",1388793600,,264,4.196078431372549
5139858,4,B0087ITBT8,"It is not the greatest ever made, but my wife and I enjoyed it. It had some laughable moments.

casting saved this movie.",1388793600,,121,4.260869565217392
5139859,5,B0087ITBT8,I thought this was a very fun and enjoyable movie. You will laugh and also relate to the mother son relationship. Do not hesitate watching you will enjoy.,1388793600,,154,4.535714285714286
5139860,4,B0087ITBT8,I enjoyed the movie and though Barbara did a great job in this one.  this one is worth a watch...,1388793600,,97,3.85
5139861,5,B0087ITBT8,"I found this film refreshing. It has a relatable storyline and excellent casting. Being a man who enjoys culture I am already enrolled into the Barbara Streisand fan club, but I didn't know Seth Rogan was such a great character actor. I really like the tone of his voice and how he portrayed subtle confidence in the face of difficult times. I deeply appreciate a story like this that isn't dependent upon explosions, swear words, or a sex scene in an attempt to engage the audience. The storyline is an everyman story. Everyone with a good heart can relate to the desire to provide sufficient time, attention, and the utmost respect to ones' mother as an adult. Conversely, I'm sure every mother can relate to finding the evolving line in providing a lifetime of emotional support to  their child. I hope Hollywood produces more films that are character driven, create introspection, and genuine laughs and smiles such as this film.",1388793600,,933,4.83125
5139862,4,B0087ITBT8,"Loved her in this move. Seth was also pretty good.  Enjoyed the chemistry, and it was a very touching story.",1388793600,,108,4.4
5139863,4,B0087ITBT8,Little slow to start but ended nicely.  Not as funny as I would have thought it would have been with Seth Rogen.  Def a good movie to pass time though!,1388793600,,151,4.0
5139864,4,B0087ITBT8,"Yes, Guilt Trip is funny, and very funny.  But I was most impressed by the dramatic scenes between mother and son. Streisand is such a legend that I often forget what a brilliant actor she is. And Rogen is so known for comedy that I was astonished by his dramatic abilities. There's a particular scene (you'll know it when it comes) that was so brilliantly acted, with such emotional rage and range, that I rewound and played it again. Anne Fletcher did a powerful job directing, and Dan Fogelman wrote a beautiful, hilarious, sad and happy screenplay.  (Too bad Amazon did not credit him.  Writers always get the raw end of the deal.)  I'd love to see the Streisand/Rogen/Fletcher/Fogelman team again in another story.",1388793600,,719,4.774193548387097
5139865,3,B0087ITBT8,"Enjoyed the movie but it wasn't what I consider great--entire premise was a little slow in my book. Good performances by the leading characters,",1388793600,,144,5.041666666666667
5139866,4,B0087ITBT8,Good movie.  Story was cute.  I coulnt personally relate to the story but I would recommend you to watch it,1388793600,,107,4.3
5139867,4,B0087ITBT8,I watched this movie with my granddaughter. It is one of the few movies that I did not have to censor parts of it. It was enjoyable and fun.,1388793600,,140,3.8620689655172415
5139868,5,B0087ITBT8,"Feel good movie from start to finish. Holds your attention through out. Enjoyable, funny and heart warming. A believable story of reconnection between a mother and son. Barbara and Seth have great chemisrty as family, and its a good story. Rare movie that you didn't want to end. Wanted to see them go on a little more in life. Promise you won't be dissapointed.",1388793600,,362,4.671875
5139869,4,B0087ITBT8,A deceptively complicated movie demonstrating the wide range of emotions and dynamics of the parent/child relationship.  There were both funny and poignant moments.  I enjoyed it.,1388793600,,179,5.846153846153846
5139870,4,B0087ITBT8,"I may not watch it again, but it was definitely worth watching once. More thought-provoking than comical, if you are a son or a mother, you will probably relate to at least something in it.",1388793600,,189,4.428571428571429
5139871,5,B0087ITBT8,"I enjoyed this movie very much. Light and always love Barbara, watch and enjoy the light fun mood.

5139873,5,B0087ITBT8,I loved this movie. The pairing of the actors for the two main characters is perfect.  No one else could have played the parts.  It kept you laughing from the beginning to the end.  Great feel good movie.,1388793600,,204,4.315789473684211
5139874,3,B0087ITBT8,Good story line and I laughed occasionally. We need to know someone's story to understand why they are who they are.,1388793600,,116,4.571428571428571

5139876,1,B0087ITBT8,"This film is four thumbs down; it was so bad, that I had to have my wife lend me her hands. It was so bad, that I couldn't even finish the last 30 minutes of the film. In fact, this film was so bad, that I felt compelled to write a review on amazon.

Barbra Streisand overacted her part as a caricature Jewish mother and Seth Rogen was miscast. The two lacked any type of chemistry together.

Overall, I feel this film is terrible.",1388793600,,431,4.119047619047619

5139879,4,B0087ITBT8,"I love the movie, very entertaining.  It reminded me of my relationships with my grown up kids. Barbra Streisand very well portrayed the mothers of today's generation. Highly recommended.",1388793600,,187,5.448275862068965
5139880,4,B0087ITBT8,Good for more than just the younger adults.  We had 3 generations watching and all enjoyed.  Was good to see Seth in a different type movie,1388793600,,139,4.3076923076923075

5139882,5,B0087ITBT8,"I got curious and flagged this movie but never really watched it until a few days later when I ran out of choices.  Good thing I did run out of choices.  This is such a great movie!!!  It tells a story of a son's relationship with his mother.  It tells a story people could actually relate to.  A story of love, respect and forgiveness.  It reminded me of the saying I read before, that no matter how much your mom annoys you, or no matter how much you argue with her, you will still end up loving and caring for her.  Their journey was more than just a business trip; it was a journey that intensified their relationship, and which made them realize that there is more life than just what you have become used to or what you have become afraid of.  They conquered it all.  Both Streisand and Rogen were amazing!",1388793600,,812,4.254901960784314

5139884,4,B0087ITBT8,"Guilt trip is a warm and funny movie, a little unexpectedly almost. The plot is well written and Barbra Streisand's acting is actually quite OK. I was expecting some overacting. But it was pretty good. In all, it was an enjoyable 2 hours watching this movie.",1388707200,,258,4.630434782608695

5139887,4,B0087ITBT8,It's a feel good comedy.  Streisand and Rogen made a believable mother and son duo.  I'll probably watch it again.,1388707200,,114,4.65

In them the language is usually pretty filthy and the scenarios, while over the top, are usually pretty darn funny.  What we have here in ""The Guilt Trip"" is a very bland, vanilla movie that is suitable for everyone in the family.  There are plenty of movies that are suitable for the whole family that are still extremely funny, this just isn't one of those movies.

The acting here is fine, it's just the source material as the story just never seems to get off the ground and the big reveal at the end is telegraphed a few miles away and isn't all that interesting anyway.  If you like Seth Rogan or Barbra Streisand then ""The Guilt Trip"" is still worthy of seeing, but don't expect anything more than an average movie that you'll probably forget right after the credits roll.",1388707200,,930,4.447058823529412

The plot is about a son and mother actually better defining their relationship and breaking down barriers -- laying the truth out there on the table and discovering that it enhances their bond. However, I wouldn't call it a ""family film."" Children would never sit through this film or understand it. It's definitely an adult film with an adult theme that caused me to think more than laugh.

5139908,4,B0087ITBT8,"I was shocked at how bad the reviews were for this movie since I thought this was a great pairing of these two actors.

I am finding more and more now that the great movie reviewers have died off and reviews are now in the hands of the multitude of journalists who simply don't have the gravitas, wisdom and good taste of, say, a Roger Ebert.

I did feel this worked and the chemistry was there. I felt Streisand was so comfortable, in fact, I found myself forgetting she was her and believing she was Joyce. This movie is all it promised to be (and to expect a great drama is foolish ... it's a road comedy about a mother-son relationship).

And, I am convinced you have to be or know an Andy (Rogen) or Joyce (Streisand) to get the script and appreciate the nuances that were there. I watched this thinking I would get to watch a character much like my Mom (always look for that since I miss her so much). Instead, I found one of my oldest friends in Joyce, was reminded all the ways she has driven me crazy since we were kids and why I love her so. I'd say that was a great result. I laughed enough, was engaged and moved, even cried at the denouement. It's a movie that reminds us that those closest to us drive us crazy and get under our skin because we love them enough to let them ... and we're far better off for it (even when we don't want to admit it).",1388620800,,1362,4.132075471698113
5139909,3,B0087ITBT8,"Oscar-winner Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen have a few funny and sweet mother-son moments, but, let's face it, about half fall flat, especially the steak-eating scene (funny?) and that scene when Streisand and Rogen argue in the hotel room, with Mom doing most of the cursing, which I'm sure was supposed to be dramatic...I think.  Then, you disappointingly realize that this was probably meant to be a pivotal scene in the movie (I was disappointed, indeed, because I have somewhat of a connection to this movie:  In the scene where Streisand is getting drunk with all the guys, the actor playing the bartender is my brother's brother-in-law).  But it's not Streisand's and Rogen's fault that some actors just don't have that on-screen chemistry that producers hope for when casting, though it may seem like it at first (just like Sandra Bullock and Bradley Cooper in ""All About Steve;"" you love them individually, but they somehow don't mesh together on screen, but that's okay; it happens), although Streisand and Rogen are respectively good and do their jobs (and, for what it's worth, I was rooting for them the whole time).  It's like the solution to a math problem being ""close enough"" but not exactly the right answer.

Unfortunately my mom is deceased now but if she were still alive, I would be purchasing this movie for her as a gift, and telling her that I love her.  I highly recommend this movie, it is touching without being too sappy, and Barbra Streisand does a great job of portraying the mom without being slapstick or too over the top.  She plays it so realistic I could has sworn she based the character after my own mom.  For any of you who have had a relationship with your mom where you were a primary focus in their lives, this movie will help you appreciate having that and realize that even though it may feel annoying at times, it just means you are really really loved and you'll miss it when it's gone.",1388620800,,979,4.293478260869565

This movie takes a very realistically uncomfortable situation and manages to evoke some potent emotions from people like myself that find healthy relationships (especially with those you do not really get to choose in your life) to be of the utmost importance. Not only does this movie cover some serious material, but it does so while keeping a nice comedic flow that does not extinguish the sincerity of the values it exhibits throughout the progression of the story.

5139930,4,B0087ITBT8,"A road trip with an overbearing Jewish mother and her guilt-laden son seems too clichd to be entertaining, and for the first one-third of the movie that was true. We learn that Andy (Seth Rogen) and his mom Joyce (Barbara Streisand) don't see each other often because she is a widow and lives alone in New Jersey and he lives in California where he went to college 10 years ago to become a scientist. He has developed a cleaning product and is peddling it across the country to large retailers, without much success, and decides on a whim to invite his mother along on the trip with San Francisco as their final destination. There are predictable scenes where she whips out a coupon at the car rental counter and guilts him into getting the little economy model car rather than the big comfortable SUV. She nags him constantly to drink more water, and worries why he has no current girlfriend. She gives him unwanted advice to help him pitch his product.

But eventually, the funny and touching scenes start to mount up; they stop at a strip club when they think they have a flat tire. Joyce downs a huge steak at a cowboy bar in Texas and gets caught up in a slot machine gambling and stays out all night in Las Vegas. Mom has brought along the audio book version of Middlesex, and if there is a more inappropriate book for a mother and son to listen to together, I can't imagine what it might be!

Surprisingly, the comedy tables are turned and Barbara Streisand gets all the funny scenes, with Seth Rogen playing the serious straight man. By the midway point of the film, I was cheering for both of them to appreciate each other more and for Andy to find success with his boring cleaning product.

The theme of an adult male trying to build a long lasting respectful relationship with his long suffering mother is one that many can relate to. The excellent casting decisions in ""Guilt Trip"" ensure that an otherwise jaded and perhaps boring premise achieves resonance with the audience.",1388188800,,1989,4.565826330532213

5139938,2,B0087ITBT8,"For a buddy comedy about an overbearing Jewish mother and her adult son, its hard to imagine a bigger casting coup than Streisand and Rogen, each of whose film personas are the embodiment of their respective stereotypes.  Both performers dove in head first with these stereotypes in The Guilt Trip, with Streisands Joyce nervously plutzing about packing weather appropriate clothes and Rogens Andy ferkrimpt at his mothers incessant phone calls in just the first few scenes of the movie.  Each enthusiastically stuffs their character full of these traits, creating recognizable if ultimately shallow character types that deliver easy laughs.

Yet as the film moves into its second act as Joyce and Andy hit the road together, The Guilt Trip immediately suffers from the lack of any real definition in the characters.  Because theres little to Joyce and Andy other than shtick, funny situations don't naturally arise from the characters, and thus the two are forced into broad and generic set pieces that could have been in just about any comedy and created a comparable level of humor.  Even these set pieces waste what little comedic potential they possess, leaving Streisand and Rogen with little material from which to work.  The two are at their best when bantering in the car between these set pieces, but these moments are far from enough to sustain the film through its ill conceived scenes.

The credits contain a few deleted scenes of Streisand and Rogan talking in the car, and more deleted scenes such as these would have been welcome, as these are the highlight of the movie.

With a brisk 95 minute running time, The Guilt Trip is easy watching, and fans of Streisand and Rogen will surely find sporadic moments of enjoyment in watching the two stars play completely to type.  The film is still a huge disappointment, and its frustrating to imagine what the two could have done with a sharper and less formulaic screenplay.",1387584000,4,1936,4.950617283950617

5139964,5,B0087ITBT8,"I found myself wondering thru 90% of this movie , ""How in the world did they get Barbra to do this"" ?  Then the end rolled around and it was so clear.  Well done delivered a great message (which I won't spoil). After reading many of the other reviews here on Amazon, I couldn't help but come back to add a comment.  This movie (in my opinion) is so much more than a Mother/Son flick. Am I the only one who was hit over the head with such a powerful message? I know I can't be the only guy in the world that wonders how or if my life had actually touched another's.",1381536000,,564,3.9734513274336285

5139969,5,B0087ITBT8,"Barbra has a major role in this movie as the mother of Seth's character. Her acting is very good, the story is sensitive and interesting. This was inspired by real life events in the life of the guy who wrote the script, who actually traveled cross country with his mom. He is a very talented person who has done some great work in Disney films.",1381104000,,345,4.323076923076923

I am also a Jewish mother with grown sons who could empathize with the joy that a mom might feel in taking a trip with her baby.  I found the film entertaining if some what predictable but, I don't always want a movie to expand my intellectual capacities.  It didn't but I liked it anyway",1380758400,,353,4.086956521739131

5139975,5,B0087ITBT8,"This is a great story! I could have written it. I was not going to rent it because I despise Barbra Streisand's big mouth political views. However, after putting that aside because I do like her as an actress and I needed something to watch on my plane trip, I am glad I did. Seth Rogan was perfect as the son and the story line where son and mother finally understand one another at the end reminded me of one of my favorite old movies: Mother with Debbie Reynolds and Albert Brooks. I would watch both again.",1380672000,,510,4.268041237113402

5139977,3,B0087ITBT8,"I alway like the stars that are in this film.  The story was silly, and insulted my inteligence.  The script was way beneath the star quality, and it pushed the realism of life.  Would only reccomend if you particually like the cast or have nothing better to pick.",1380412800,,264,4.458333333333333
5139978,3,B0087ITBT8,This was a good movie - although not as funny as I expected.  As with a lot of movies - all the really funny stuff was used in the trailers.,1380240000,,140,3.6666666666666665
5139979,4,B0087ITBT8,"As usual Barbara Streisand has turned out a funny, entertaining piece of work. It shows the professionalism in her. Bogin was excellent too.
RTS",1379894400,,144,5.041666666666667
5139980,4,B0087ITBT8,"Barbara is the quintessential loving, concerned, and supportive mother who embarks on a road trip with the hope of helping her overly anxious, condescending, and narcissistic son overcome his self inflicted solitude.

Joyce (Barbara's character) loves life and she is a people person whereas her reserved son is a withdrawn and conservative chemist who loves his mother.

This is a charming film that every parent should watch with their teenage and or adult child.  Though Andrew and Joyce (Mom) seem to be completly opposite in their sensibilities, they are actually more alike than they think. They not only form a partnership, but they form an incredible new parent child bond.

The dialogue is common place for parental interaction, but Barbara adds oomph to the script.  Her delivery is impeccable.

Joyce (Barbara) meets a really hot cowboy guy Ben Graw.  Love this line--Andrew (son): Why do you want to feed me all the time?  Food is love.  Andy seems to open up and come alive as the movie progresses.

The movie held my interest and my attention.  The characters became so real to me that I forgot I was watching a movie.  It didn't insult my intelligence, and nor was it typical or boring.  I laughed, worried, and felt empathy for the characters. Charming and lovely movie.

I hope you enjoy this charming and light hearted comedy as much as I did.  I tried not to give away too much of the movie.",1379808000,,1410,4.768595041322314

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: `The Guilt Trip' probably represents the only point in time when the careers of Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen synchronise enough to bring them together for a two-hander. Somehow, a mother-son road trip comedy seemed like the right move for both entertainers, separated by two generations and distant fan bases.

Music legend Barbra Streisand began her film career forty-five years ago with a Best Actress OSCAR win. A Golden Globe Awards fixture who graduated to directing and producing, 71-year-old Streisand wields a staggered but respected filmography. Seth Rogen, who just turned 31, emerged as the comedic voice of his generation six summers ago when two of his raunchy R-rated comedies in Judd Apatow's Knocked Up' [2007] and the Seth Rogen screenplay Superbad' [2007] were among the year's most successful and acclaimed films at the time. Within two years, doubt began to form over his leading man status and since `The Green Hornet' [2011] showed him people weren't any crazier about him as fit, sarcastic superhero than as his signature chubby, sarcastic stoner, he and Hollywood have been rethinking his calling.

Based on this trajectory, you might think Barbra Streisand was slumming in a desperate attempt to appeal to young people. In reality, though, her filmmaking legacy had been tarnished by her first two 21st century acting credits: playing Ben Stiller's mother in the sequels Meet the Fockers' and Little Fockers.' The first of those was outrageously successful, though only moderately popular. The second was neither. Thus, a Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen pairing held rebound potential for both of its stars.

With a script by rising Dan Fogelman which includes Crazy,' Stupid, Love' and `Tangled,' the film seemed destined to do solid holiday season business and vie for some Golden Globe Awards in the Comedy or Musical categories. Alas, `The Guilt' Trip' would do neither of those things, grossing a weak $37.1 million on a $40 million budget and picking up just a single award nomination of the undesirable variety, especially Barbra Streisand getting a Razzie for the Worst Actress. Embarrassingly, the night before the Golden Globe Awards nominations were announced, an overconfident Paramount Pictures uploaded a promo celebrating the Best Actress nod to Barbra Streisand actually wouldn't get.

Dan Fogelman doesn't offer much in the way of originality or complexity here. Andy Brewster [Seth Rogen] lives in California. His long-widowed mother Joyce Brewster [Barbra Streisand] lives in New Jersey. She fills his voicemail with conversational messages in expectation of a rare visit. Joyce likes to question her son Andy about his love life, to his discomfort. Meanwhile, Joyce shoots down his reciprocal question by saying she values being single for the ability to enjoy fun size bags of M&M Peanuts, immediately before and after bed. When Joyce reveals to Andy that he was named after her first boyfriend, a Florida advertiser who let her get away, Andy Brewster does some online sleuthing and tracks this former love to San Francisco. A bachelor with a Master's in chemistry, Andy is planning to take an eight-day road trip to pitch his creation, a new organic cleaning spray, to major retailers around the country. He decides to make San Francisco the final stop and invites Joyce to join him on the Road trip!

That sitcom premise takes nagging, cost-conscious mother and embarrassed son to sitcom stops for motel and diner sketches. In snowy Tennessee, Andy's high school sweetheart, now married and pregnant, recalls his rejected teenaged proposal to her. In Lubbock, Texas, Joyce gets an hour on the clock to eat a four-pound steak dinner in its entirety for free or fail and pay $100. In Las Vegas, Joyce gets the thrill of playing actual slot machines and not just the cell phone equivalents.

Meanwhile, Andy's pitches to the likes of Kmart and Costco are a disaster, with executives not responding to his scientific claims or prop usage while struggling with the product's tough to pronounce name ""Scieoclean."" Once Joyce suggests some ways to spice up his presentations, you can probably declare with ease where the film is heading and I don't just mean San Francisco and by the end of the film you want it to carry on.

Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen, whose age difference is perfectly feasible thus highly unusual for Hollywood comedies, have decent chemistry together and better than you'd expect given the different circles they run in. Seth Rogen's foul-mouthed, drug-based shtick is softened quite a bit, but not enough to defang his comedic chops. He and Barbra Streisand are believable representatives of their different generations and they are able to bounce off each other, at times with apparent improvisation.

The material has never been any better than a random episode of a mediocre twenty-year-old sitcom, but its comfort food comedy and the deliveries are good enough to unearth a bit of zest. Many of the beats are defiantly unoriginal: a man insisting on buying Joyce a drink at a cowboy bar, an uncomfortable book on tape, a mini-bar binge blow-up. But enough genuine details, e.g. Joyce's purse hook and insistence on hydration, emerge to distinguish the outing and prevent it from feeling like a dj vu embodying one of comedy cinema's most exploited conventions.

Blu-ray Video Quality  `The Guilt Trip' 1080p encoded transfer isn't the most stunning thing ever released in Blu-ray high definition, but Paramount Pictures stable, enjoyable presentation gets the job done. There are some gorgeous roadway and city shots; overhead highway images or dense downtown locations both reveal fantastic textures, crisp lines, and precise details even at a distance. General facial and clothing details are fine, though not really as crisp as those seen in the best Blu-ray releases. There is a light softness to parts of the image, and sometimes definition can be a little muddled, particularly in warmer locations such as a Texas steakhouse and a Vegas casino. Still, basic definition is just fine, particularly under good lighting. Colours are well balanced, favouring warmth in those more harshly lit environments and a more natural presence in those more naturally lit places. Black levels are not problematic, though flesh tones do look a bit rosy at times. The image suffers from no obvious bouts of digital tinkering, print wear, or compression issues. This isn't a breath-taking transfer, but it's a good, stable, clean high definition release that suits the movie well.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  `The Guilt Trip' features the old ""technically proficient, but sonically dull"" 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack, which would of been better served if it had just been a 2.0 Dolby Digital Stereo soundtrack. No surprise, this is a dialogue-heavy film with little else to offer. Fortunately, the spoken word comes through as well as it can, playing with a natural, front-focused clarity. The track otherwise features some scattered ambient sound effects that help set the stage for various scenes and that enjoy natural, pinpoint positioning around the stage. Whether the light rattle inside the rental car and the minor whooshing sounds of passing traffic as heard when it's cruising down the interstate, booms of thunder and gusts of wind as heard in chapter six, or little Country music and general restaurant clatter as heard in chapter nine, the track presents the little supportive pieces quite effortlessly. This is certainly no massively immersive sort of presentation, but the basic quality is evident with every syllable and sound effect.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Barbra & Seth [2012] [1080p] [7:32] Cast and crew take a look at the chemistry between the stars and the acting chops of Seth Rogen and Barbra Streisand. Some fun on-set moments are interspersed throughout.

Special Feature: Barbra's World [2012] [1080p]  [8:21] Cast and crew talk about what it's like to work with a legend while examining the specific qualities Barbra Streisand brought to The Guilt Trip.

Special Feature: Guilt Trip: Real Mother of a Road Trip [2012] [1080p] [5:47] Writer Dan Fogelman shares the real influences that shaped his script.

Special Feature: In the Driver's Seat [2012] [1080p] [7:15] A closer look at the style and contributions of Director Anne Fletcher.

Special Feature: Not Really a Road Trip Movie [2012] [1080p] [5:16] A piece that examines recreating various stretches of the United States in California.

Special Feature: Alternate Openings [2012] [1080p] Andy Growing Up [1:26] and Alternate Title Sequence [1:10]. The former is an excellent 86 seconds that would have greatly enhanced the picture.

Special Feature: Alternate Ending [2012] [1080p] [2:08] adds a joke and gives Andy a potential love interest while reinforcing Joyce's.

Special Feature: Gag Reel [2012] [1080p] [5:09] Compilation outtakes revealing the production's giggly atmosphere and openness to improvisation. As in the other extras, F-bombs are bleeped here. The highlight comes in the end, as Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen talk Green Hornet and Green Lantern.

Deleted Scenes [2012] [1080p] [19:23] Underwear, Typical Weekend Plans, Chicken Dinner Uncut, Extended Mature Singles Club, Really Wonderful Man, Water Cooler Outtakes, That's All I'm Gonna Say, Rental Car, GPS, Amanda  The Receptionist, Parking, and Crush.

DVD Copy [Feature Film] The DVD included here, is identical to the one sold separately, contains no bonus features other than ""Previews,"" which simply repeats Star Trek Into Darkness,' `Jack Reacher' and `Not Fade Away' trailers with which the disc opens. Paramount Pictures has subscribed to the trend of devaluing the DVD even more than any other studio, seemingly altogether doing away with bonus features on the still most popular format. Adding insult to injury here, the DVD only uses 5.28 GB of a dual-layered disc's 8 GB capacity, meaning there is ample room for some of the dropped extras.

Finally, 'The Guilt Trip' is a really pleasant surprise. It begins slowly but ends strongly, efficiently building up, breaking down, and again, but differently, building up its characters to a predictable but heart-warming and wholly satisfying resolution. The film works as well as it does because of the greatness of its leads; Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen are simply wonderful together. They understand the story, the characters, and one another so well that the relationship and the entire dynamic, not just bits and pieces feel as authentic as most any other memorable cinema family. Don't let a slow start ruin the film; it only gets better with every minute. Paramount Pictures Blu-ray release of `The Guilt Trip' offers a very solid video, fine audio and a few nice supplements to keep you amused. Highly Recommended!

5140127,5,B0087ITBT8,"""The Guilt Trip, amidst much of the mixed reviews given to it and James L. Brooks-like similarities in writing, is surprisingly one of the best and most earnest comedies/dramas seen in a while.

In the modern tale of a mother-son relationship, Seth Rogen and Barbara Streisand go on a journey all the way through New Jersey to California in a Chevrolet Aveo as a means to satisfy Rogen character's promotional escapades to sell an organic liquid cleanser and to develop a stronger bond. What makes the film stand out is much of the film's treatment of the subject matter with moments involving them dealing with the usual quarrels and quibs that a loving mother would feel for his son (talking about their love lives, parenting, or recommending that he would drink water or lessen his alcohol intake).

It is equally at parts heartfelt where we see notable but never overtly sentimental moments of Andy and Joyce, the two characters' names, dealing with their lives, sense of isolation from friends, loved ones, and past acquaintances. It is quirky and follows a Hollywood model in my places with the occasional PG-13 sex jokes and stereotypes but the film does not take the usual comedy route these days where ""that and that only"" is the prime focus (think other movies that Rogen's done before like Pineapple Express).

Nothing stellar in terms of a social message, cinematography, or design but the acting and storyline all stand out to create a believable story that many can relate to and watch, laugh, and probably cry. For all reasons unknown, it might have been the Marty, the 1950s Ernest Borgnine film about an unmarried New York butcher, of December 2012.""",1373760000,4,1667,4.88339222614841

The ""road trip"" was a venue for the two of them to work out personal unresolved issues and their own relationship.",1373760000,,425,4.3544303797468356

They make a great comedic duo, it also seemed more serious for most Seth Rogen movies.  He tends to play in a lot of slap stick humor type of movies, this one was one of those films that portrayed a better more serious Seth Rogen.... I like",1373673600,,398,4.012658227848101

She never quits & as far as I'm concerned, as well as the friends and family members who love her, she gets better as the yrs go by.

It's just pure entertainment with the incomparable Ms. Streisand proving that she hasn't lost a bit of her magic and her ability to communicate with her eyes (watch the scene when she learns the name of her lost  love's daughter).

Although the basics of the film are pretty canned Hollywood, you just cannot get better than how Streisand works a character.  She is absolutely at her best when she is doing comedy.  She makes the characters complex.  Rogan was also wonderful in his angst with his mother, their relationship, and his feelings of being told what to do with his business.  All in all a great ride with some authentic character acting showing depth.",1373500800,,640,4.628318584070796

Its a road trip of discovery, they find out things about each other that they never knew.  It ends happily enough, but I wouldn't say this film was hilarious, it dragged in parts, and Seth Rogen mumbled a lot.

5140162,5,B0087ITBT8,"My son rented it after another movie scared the pants off me.

This movie was GREAT!!! I think the negative reviews are because of the way it was marketed. When you see Seth, you do think HEAVY comedy,
like in his film ""This is the End"" that's in theatres now. However, that aside, the movie was great. I didn't laugh as much as I thought I would, but
I was humored. I enjoyed it and will watch it again after I finish the scary movie now that it's day time.

I would recommend this movie for every mother and child, even parent and child. Both my son & daughter act as if I work their nerves
overtime (and we aren't jewish), and my mother messes my nerves up. This goes to show the development of parent child relationships
and I believe this movie will and has made for better parent child relations, because it gives you something to think about.

I highly recommend this BUT, this is not a comedy, not full blown (although you may laugh a little).",1372896000,,951,4.301675977653631

5140170,3,B0087ITBT8,"I took a pass on this film when it was in theaters but recently caught up to it on a drowsy Saturday afternoon.  I wasn't expecting much and certainly from the aspect of seeing something fresh and new I got what I was expecting.  Still I have to admit, I enjoyed Barbra Streisand as a lead actress once again.  And yes she still can be effectively funny.  Here she plays a meddlesome and stereotypical Jewish mother.

Living in New Jersey, Joyce is expecting a visit from her only son, Andy (Seth Rogen) who is flying in from California for a business presentation.  Andy, a chemical engineer by trade, has invented a cleaning product that is all organic and has no deadly ingredients.  Unfortunately he gave it a terrible name that is neither pronounceable nor understandable.  Andy can't wait to get away from his loving mom, but when she tells him a sweet story about her first love as a 19 year old, he discovers the man works for a large company in San Francisco.

Since Andy has a series of presentations across the country he was going to drive to each.  This whole premise is a borders on ridiculous as it is unlikely that large companies like Costco, K-Mart and a shopping channel are going to listen to this guy who has no track record.  With that out of the way, Joyce insists they save money where they can, since Andy is essentially broke.  So they room together and are bundled up in a Chevy Aero which is just a tad larger than a toaster.

Probably the best scenes are in Lubbock, Texas where Joyce takes on the challenge of eating a 4 pound steak with all the trimmings.  It's free if she does it in an hour.  It will cost $100 if she doesn't.  With Las Vegas as the last stop, Andy breaks the news that he had found her former love in San Francisco.  After first refusing (sure), Babs, I mean Joyce says yes.  There is a double surprise at the end which is fitting for the film.  OK, I admit it, I liked the whole trip.",1372550400,,1936,4.342618384401114

On the otherhand, I am not usually a Streisand fan, but she's been a real delight n the Fockers franchise. All in all, I wasn't sure what to expect when we ordered this rental, but I am really glad we did. They both do a great job in the film, though there is a funny interchange between them and their shenanigans are funny as well, the focus is the relationship between the mother and her grown up son. That story is really warm and endearing, and made me think about calling my mother several times.

There is a central revelation about 15 minutes into the movie which runs through the rest like a red line.

The script is fantastic, and the editing so effective you'll never have a dull moment in an action-packed 90+ minutes.  Seth Rogen and Barbra Streisand make an incomparable duo.

So much potential with these two brilliant actors, Seth Rogen and Barbra Streisand, a great premise, the possibility of real relationship between a reluctant son and overbearing mother.  Instead, the film is flat with no drama, no feeling other than skimming the surface, no trajectory even though the beginning, middle and end of a road trip provides a natural journey.  Something went wrong:  there is no ""give"", no investment, it feels lukewarm throughout (a far cry from a much better film, ""Mother"" with Debbie Reynolds and Albert Brooks.  That I recommend unreservedly for the same premise with a much better outcome.)  It does not feel like the movie even begins until well over an hour in with the eating episode.  Somehow, food transcends the vice-grip of dull moderation.  I can't recommend this film, sadly, because it is a journey that never starts and goes no where.  It is a great shame the pace is so terribly off - I wanted it to be as exceptionally good as the lead cast.",1370476800,,1080,4.6421052631578945

5140333,5,B0087ITBT8,"Barbra hasn't done a lot of acting over the last 15 years or so, but you couldn't tell it by ""Guilt Trip""! Actually, painful as her long vacation was for us fans, it seems to have been great for Ms. Streisand. She is relaxed and better than ever! She is wonderful in this role! And critics- don't say she plays the role of a Jewish mother so well because she is a Jewish mother! Joyce Brewster and Andy live on opposite sides of the country and rarely see each other. Barbra and her son, Jason, live near each other and see each other on a regular basis. So we have two entirely different situations!
When reading articles about the movie before and during filming, it seemed the movie was about Seth Rogen's character, that Barbra was in the co-starring role. I got a little irritated  more than a few times, when interviewers questioned Seth about how he felt about starring opposite Barbra. Questions like, ""Is she going to sing?"" had obvious implications. However while watching the movie it becomes very obvious that this movie is Barbra's!
When the movie finally premiered (after 3 or 4 postponements), I was not only thrilled to see Barbra on the big screen again, I was amazed at how great she looks and once again reminded of just how immensely talented she is!

Yes, they do still make them.  I know it's hard to believe.  I walked away from this movie feeling good about it and myself, of which I just can't say about many of the movies made lately.  Although Barbara Streisand is not my favorite person, she performs beautifully in this film as the overbearing/butting in mother.  Seth Rogen is his usual funny/quirky self and shows a lot of heart in this film.  I recommend it...especially if you want a fairly clean comedy.  There were some suggestive scenes, some drinking and a few bad words (including at least one ""F"" word)...so it's still not for kids, but given most of the alternatives lately...I was pleased.  :)",1369699200,,815,4.636363636363637

In this case, the entire movie is one big Jewish guilt trip from momma to son... like you need a movie to tell you about that! In this film, however, it's more a case of mother and son rediscovering who the other is and who they thought them to be... while taking a road trip together. So the title is a pun, a play on words. We've seen this same theme in other films, like ""Bridges of Madison County"" where the kids discover their mother is nothing like who they thought she was. Unfortunately, the film starts out so rough, it's like starting with a bad hors d'oeuvre; most people are ready to ask for the check before all the good stuff gets put on the plate. The film does improve after it first meanders around looking for a point. I could never fault Streisand. Her talent is too obvious, even when she isn't singing. She's as good an actress as the best of the them. Hear that Meryl? The problem is Seth Rogen. As a stand up comic, he's terrific. But as an actor, he has problems with screen presence... and it isn't his fault. Someone behind the camera is dwelling on him too long. He would be better in short snippets - delivering one liners instead of long speeches. The film has its moments and is good if you are a Streisand fan. Otherwise, its only mediocre at best.",1369612800,,1386,4.314176245210728

5140367,3,B0087ITBT8,"How can I give both ""Guilt Trip"" and ""Silver Linings Playbook"" 3 stars?  Because I think ""Guilt Trip"" mostly succeeds in what it sets out to be: A somewhat comedic portrayal of a mother/son relationship that isn't really dysfunctional -- rather the characters are grappling with their own issues that unsurprisingly get resolved during a road trip they take from New Jersey (where mom lives) to California (where son lives).

The movie doesn't suffer from pretentiousness; if anything, it aims a little too low.  There are some serious moments when Barbra Streisand's sort of stereotypical, overbearing mother character, Joyce, gets too much in her son's business.  But of course, it's all for his own good.  There's no maliciousness here -- the relationship between Andy (Seth Rogen) and Joyce is actually quite sweet.  Andy's father died when he was 8 and in terms of intimate relationships, they have pretty much been alone in the world together.  Even from thousands of miles away, Joyce can be rather obsessive in terms of her devotion to her only child, who doesn't reciprocate in a way that makes her confident in their intimacy.  The road trip solves all that. (If you consider that last line a spoiler, you shouldn't watch this movie.)

It's revealed early on that Andy is named after Joyce's first true love, and that becomes a centerpiece of the movie that I didn't expect.  The focus of the story is definitely on Joyce and settling her into a better middle-age than her rather boring lifestyle is currently affording her.  The mother/son relationship is never really tattered or in danger...Joyce's nagging of Andy is constant, but fairly amusing.  And frankly, the movie never gets that deep.  These are two people who are a little lost in their lives, who happen to be mother in son.  Joyce lives like a nun, and Andy is struggling to fulfill his career ambitions.  They help each other get over their respective humps during this cross-country trip during which Andy is trying to sell an organic cleaning product he's created. They're two funny people.  That's pretty much it.

There are a couple of poignant moments if you can allow yourself to get wrapped up enough in the movie to appreciate them.  The acting is good given how little meat is in the script -- but I was very aware that I was watching two people who were acting like mother and son.  Honestly, in terms of ""recent"" movies, I enjoyed watching Ms. Streisand play the character of Roz Focker in ""Meet the Fockers"" more than I did watching her play a fuddy duddy housewife in this vehicle.  Joyce seems more like a grandmother than a mother.  But that's from where much of the humor is derived, and I did laugh a few times, which is what I wanted.  And although it isn't Oscar material, I wasn't insulted by ""Guilt Trip"" either.  It's a nice movie.",1369440000,,2829,4.763860369609857

5140373,4,B0087ITBT8,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

Out of all of the movies I've seen this past week I think this is the one that I expected to like the least. On the contrary, I found the The Guilt Trip to be really, really enjoyable. More enjoyable, in fact, than I ever would have expected it to be. This film's strongest attributes are its charm and relatability. Everyone knows what it's like to have a mother, but this film focuses a lot on the mother/son relationship (obviously). Now I love my mother to death, but there's just something about moms where sometimes they don't know when to stop and we don't know how to tell them that they're being overbearing until we snap. I think this film does a good job of focusing on this concept and the Rogen/Streisand duo do a great job of bringing that relationship to life.

The premise is simple really. You follow Andy Brewster (Seth Rogen), a struggling inventor of a new, organic cleaning product. He has to go across country to try and sell this product to big companies in hopes that they will be willing to distribute it in large quantities. Once he learns a secret from his mother Joyce's (Barbra Streisand) past he invites her to come a long. The only thing is she thinks that business is good and he doesn't want to tell her otherwise because he doesn't want her worrying about him. She accepts and you spend the remaining 60-70 minutes following these two across their week-long road trip.

As a whole I thought the story was enjoyable, nothing groundbreaking, but it was charming and full of laughs. Upon doing some research I found out that Streisand was nominated for ""Worst Actress"" for this film. 1) I didn't even know that was a thing and 2) I think that's a bit of an overstatement. Streisand is in no way Academy Award material, but it would be wrong to deny that she and Rogen have fantastic chemistry on screen. In a movie like this you need two actors who can emulate that mother/son relationship and these two did it perfectly.

This is what ultimately what makes this film enjoyable. We can relate to what is going on in these scenes because we've all been there in some form or another. Maybe it wasn't on a road trip, but the conversations and arguments that are had in this movie are the same ones had by other mother/child relationships daily. The funniest scenes in here are the ones where this dynamic is shown in full force. For example, because she's with him on this road trip she has to go into the buildings with him when he has his meetings. While they're waiting she's rummaging through her purse, making a bunch of noise, playing loud games on her phone, and wishing him good luck as he's walking away. I think it's one of those things that no matter how old you get you're always going to feel slightly embarrassed by your mother.

The casting is relatively small in here. The focus is mainly on Rogen and Streisand so don't expect to see a huge group of familiar faces. Most of the supporting cast comes and goes in a matter of minutes. However, there are two other characters who play a pretty major role in the story. Without giving away their roles you have Brett Cullen playing Ben Graw and Adam Scott playing Andrew Margolis, Jr. Still, even these two are only in here for maybe three minutes each. Because Rogen and Streisand are the main focus their performances could make or break the film. Luckily they both did a solid job. Rogen is back with another semi-serious role and I think I'm starting to enjoy seeing this side of him. Streisand, as previously mentioned, wasn't exceptional, but she played her part well and that's all that matters.

Overall Score: 8/10 - Depending on who you are there's a lot of fun to be had in The Guilt Trip. It's one of those rare comedies that doesn't force itself to stray into ""dirty"" humor just for an easy laugh. Instead, it's more heartfelt and I think that's why I enjoyed it as much as I did. It's charming and fun without being aimed at children and I think it'd be nice to see more comedies like this. If this film was on your radar but you missed it in theaters then I would say watch it. It's a fun comedy that doesn't overstay its welcome and it's entertaining from start to finish.",1369353600,,4231,4.495448634590377

Barbra Striesand is such a great actress, I had forgotten that until I saw this, and Seth Rogen was very good too. It was not too long, the jokes were funny, and I can't imagine not enjoying it. It is exactly what it says it is.",1369094400,,341,4.104477611940299
5140389,3,B0087ITBT8,It was an interesting plot but I was not crazy about it. I would not watch it again. The mom's nagging throughout the movie had me going nuts! It was just continuous and ugh! Seth Rogan was not given the opportunity to be his usual funny self because he couldn't play off his co-star as well.,1369094400,,292,4.232142857142857
5140390,3,B0087ITBT8,I expected something more from this film. I thought it was supposed to be a comedy. Then it was a mother son road trip. It seemed to drag on. Identity Theft has the same in the car road trip scenes in that movie. There was action and it was funny. I guess I felt as if I had seen this before but done better. It was a bore. What is so funny about Barabra Streisand acting pissy before eating a steak in a timed eating competition? Seth Rogen looked like he was bored to be in that scene. It fell flat. Green Hornet should have taught Hollywood Seth Rogen can not carry a film. The bar scenes in the trailer were about that short. I don't know if the editor left the funny on the cutting floor or what happened there.,1369094400,,716,4.085106382978723
5140391,5,B0087ITBT8,"This was a great movie.  It reminded me so much of myself and my son.  I can just imagine us going on a road trip together.  It really hit close to home.  I would recommend it to anyone who values their family. It's funny and so real.  Thank you Barbara. Both characters were great.  I have always loved Barbara Streisand, her music and movies.",1369094400,,344,4.296875

5140395,5,B0087ITBT8,"Despite the bad reviews on rottentomatoes.com, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Both Rogen's and Streisand's performances were strong. An instant Mother's Day classic!",1369008000,,167,6.304347826086956
5140396,4,B0087ITBT8,Very cute and lol.  Watched with the whole family and everyone could relate! I would definitely recommend watching this movie with your adult children!,1369008000,,151,5.291666666666667
5140397,4,B0087ITBT8,"Whether this is the movie Barbra might have seen as an ideal return to the screen in a starring role, she has absolutely nothing to be ashamed of.  This pairing of Seth Rogan and Barbra is almost a match made in heaven.  Seth is a strong enough personality to not be overshadowed by the power of Streisand's.  While the second half of the movie is absolutely charming, it's the first half that sets the tone of the story.  The viewer will have almost as much of an adventure crossing the country as its stars do.  So if you're looking for something light and fun, you just can't go wrong with ""Guilt Trip.""  It left me hoping for a reteaming of the movie's two stars, for they definitely do have a chemistry.",1369008000,,708,4.366412213740458

5140401,5,B0087ITBT8,Didn't think it was going to be this nuanced...with some big laughs as well.  I would easily recommend this for somebody lookinjg for a well crafted comedy.,1368921600,,156,4.777777777777778

This movie was both hilarious and had deeply moving components as well.  I loved the story line and both leading actors/actresses did an amazing job.

I would HIGHLY recommend this feel good movie.",1368835200,,411,4.5

5140407,4,B0087ITBT8,I thought this movie may be very predictable but I enjoy both of the lead actors so much so I thought I'd give it a viewing. It was funny and charming. I hope Barbra doesn't go into retirement too soon!,1368748800,,202,4.075
5140408,1,B0087ITBT8,"Surprisingly, this is not what I expected from Barbara Streisand. It was so slow I didn't even finish watching it. Boring, that's all I can say.",1368748800,2,144,4.576923076923077
5140409,3,B0087ITBT8,Not one of Barbara's best by far.  Story line is kind of stupid.....not a favorite.  Wouldn't suggest it to anyone I know.,1368748800,,122,4.5

5140411,3,B0087ITBT8,The movie seemed to move along slowly.  It was not hilarious but it did have some funny parts.  Not something I would ever want to watch again.,1368662400,,143,4.2592592592592595
5140412,4,B0087ITBT8,I'm not sure why people feel they have to put profanity in a great movie. It just ruins it! It even sounded awkward- like it was just stuck in there all of a sudden for no reason. It was such a great movie without the profanity. I like the psychology of it.,1368576000,,257,3.9615384615384617
5140413,3,B0087ITBT8,It was ok. renting through amazon didn't help the experience. poor video quality and it had to stop the movie to buffer every 5 minutes. Won't rent through amazon again.,1368576000,,169,4.666666666666667

5140416,4,B0087ITBT8,This was a pretty decent movie considering I'm not a big fan of Streisand or Rogan.  Irony but not really a comedy.,1368576000,,115,4.2272727272727275

5140420,4,B0087ITBT8,I liked it but I do think that an older person  50s + is more likely to enjoy this  as they can identify more with the Mother.  It was a nice light comedy..,1368576000,,156,3.6666666666666665

5140423,4,B0087ITBT8,"I was leery about renting this movie because of Seth Rogen.  I thought it was going to be extremely cheesy with the junior high type of humor that he is known for these days.  However, everyone watching it was really surprised by the depth of the movie while keeping the funny moments in tact.  I've recommended this to others as a must see.  I give it 4 stars only because it is not the big budget oscar powerhouse type.  I reserve 5 stars for those.",1368576000,,451,4.258823529411765

5140426,4,B0087ITBT8,Ah the good intentions of mothers paired with the struggle to be an adult in the face of those intentions.  They writing pulls this off well and the acting is great.  Worth watching.,1368576000,,182,4.484848484848484

5140445,4,B0087ITBT8,"I almost passed on the opportunity to own this gem of a movie, but finally decided to take a chance on the team of Streisand and Rogan in a comedy. It wasn't a big risk, not with actors the caliber of Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogan. I loved this movie! I laughed throughout and even got misty eyed a time or two. The story was heart warming, the characters were loveable and the parent to grown child relationship evolution, all to familiar.

It's a pretty formulaic screenplay and you could predict pretty much most of the story line.  Barbra is great as the overbearing Jewish mother and I thought that Seth's Andy role could have been written with a little more backbone to him but all in all I enjoyed the movie.

It was not comparable to her other work, in quality, but it was Barbra, nonetheless.  Part of the reason I like her is that she is familiar.  I was raised in a liberal, Jewish home, have spent a fair amount of time in New York, and I'm blunt and musical.  She touches all of those parts of me.  While there was no music in this movie, all the other parts were there.  I enjoyed it.  4 rather than 5 stars, because while it was enjoyable, it wasn't fabulous;)",1368144000,,560,4.091743119266055

5140490,4,B0087ITBT8,"""The Guilt Trip ""  stars Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen as mother and son who set out on a cross-country road trip as awkward entrepreneur Andrew (Rogen) pitches a new cleaning product to wholesalers.  Andrew's plan in taking along his widowed mom, Joyce, is to reunite her with a former young love who's now living in San Francisco.  If they meet and rekindle their long-ago romance, hopefully Joyce will quit focusing all her attention on Andrew and stop her endless henpecking.  Most of the film's gags are based on Andrew's embarrassment at traveling with his overbearing mother.

The film is a sweet comedy with Streisand actually working at portraying a real character rather than a caricature.  More subdued than you might expect, she lets the writing do its job and never pushes too hard with the jokes.  Rogen is not his usual bawdy goof.  He elicits empathy as a smart man unable to sell his product or himself.  There's none of the R-rated language and off-color humor associated with his other screen work.  Director Anne Fletcher balances screen time pretty equally between Rogen and Streisand.

Blu-ray bonus features include alternate openings and endings, several deleted scenes, gag reel, making-of short, profiles of Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen, and behind-the-scenes featurettes.",1368057600,,1303,5.1571428571428575

5140494,3,B0087ITBT8,"When I first heard about GUILT TRIP, I imagined a seriously hilarious film. What could be funnier than a road trip with Barbra Streisand? Unfortunately, the potential fun of this movie is missed and we have a slow-moving and rather tedious film--at least for a good portion of this adventure.

Streisand  as Joyce Brewster is rather toned down from the Barbra we have seen through the years. She's a fairly normal middle-class widow living in suburbia when her son Andy (Seth Rogan) invites her on a cross-country road trip. Surprisingly, it's not about a guilt trip. Joyce coddles her son and believes in his greatness. She's not critical yet there is tension in their relationship and the reason is never clear.

THE GUILT TRIP moves so slowly and there is barely a chuckle. Rogan and Streisand seem to have a potential for great chemistry but the problem seems to be the uninspired script. The film plods on and on until the fateful emotional blow-up between mother and son. Again, the reason for this tension is never fully explored and it's Andy who has the unexplained chip on his shoulder. Just when there seems no hope for this film, it makes an amazing recovery as mother and son come to terms with their relationship and realize how much they mean to each other.

Suddenly, we finally have the film we should have had all along. The road trip becomes fun and joyous as mother and son get to know each other and their disappointments and challenges in life. Surprisingly, the last part of the film is rather heartwarming, delightful and moving. Some might be moved to shed a tear or two over the sweetness and gentleness of the last scenes. These last 20-30 minutes or so of THE GUILT TRIP make up for the pointlessness of the film and make it worth a watch. It's only sad the greatness of the last part of the film could not have been seem throughout THE GUILT TRIP.",1367971200,,1876,4.607784431137724
5140495,4,B0087ITBT8,This movie was better than I expected it would. A believable relationship between a mother and an adult son. I loved all the people they met along the way. This movie makes me want to go on a road trip with my twenty-something son! I loved the ending.,1367884800,,251,4.25

5140497,4,B0087ITBT8,"As a rule, I only do straight fact product reviews. I don't review books or video because that is the ""Toppers"" territory. But I just had to speak up on this movie, Guilt Trip. My wife wanted to watch this, I thought to myself, 'chick flick! Oh great...But chemistry between the actors had me in a very short time drawn in and the Son and Mother relationship was so believable. Rogan is best known for his quick witted raunchy humor and his fluent use of profanity. But in this role I don't believe he cursed ONE time because his mother (Barbra Streisand) does not allow it. Streisand always plays her roles to perfection, but Rogans portrayal of the somewhat bumbling nerdy chemist guy whom obviously loves his mother but (like most of us with loving but over protective parents) can hardly stand being around her good intentioned nagging, was right on the spot! Rogans complete identity transformation for this movie is fantastic. And when it was over l had the strongest urge to go and call MY mother! The ""Top Reviewers"" argue that a review should not be about opinion, but your know what, I really dug this flick! Normally, I myself do not go for these kind of 'lovey feely good' movies but I really enjoyed it...I would recommend this movie to everybody...Guys if you have to watch a Chick Flick with your gal to make up for her having to sit through endless MMA matches, get this one!",1367798400,3,1391,4.568

Im stupefied as to why Barbra Streisand would play this role. Shes far too good for something this badly written. The last thing any mom wants to hear on her day is a contentious adult son being so nasty to his mother. The only good thing about this movie was that I rented it  if I had gone to the theatre to see it or purchased the film, Id be livid.

Seth Rogen plays the son who is struggling with his life and finds some success when he follows his mother's advice. This is a light, but heartfelt film where Streisand really shines as a woman who is easy to identify with and who you would want as a friend - her warmth, sense of caring, and sense of humor really come through.",1367798400,,610,4.504504504504505

5140509,2,B0087ITBT8,"I like Barbra Streisand, always have, yet ""Guilt Trip"" is not worth having her come out of retirement to waste her time. Actually, I cannot believe she did! I didn't like Seth Rogan in ""Knocked Up"" with lovely Kathryn Heigel and even less in this flop. He does not have good screen presence. Even less attractive men like Steve Buscemi can have great on-screen presence, but Mr. Rogan simply does not. Nor does he even vaguely resemble Streisand to pass as her son.

And I'm just beginning my objections to this celluloid mess, which could have been better with script tweaking, nah, script rewriting. Some scenes had me think, aha, a passibly good one, then it isn't. An example is the silly free meal if you eat a 50-ounce steak. No, not Rogan, it's Streisand. The little flirtation that developes in this scene just did not make sense in that context.

The only time I like Rogan occurs in the scene in which he finally, finally tells his mom to shut up! Streisand's character talks incessantly, INCESSANTLY! Even I was telling her to just shut it! Of course, her feelings are hurt. They always are when annoying people are finally told how annoying they are. It's this scene and all the preceding ones that make me curious why Streisand would take this role.

OK, bottom line: The movie is about a man who has invented a tremendous product but has a poor sales technique. He invites his mom to take a cross-country road trip with him as he tries to sell his product. She is unaware that he is a failure because she is yakking all the time, telling him how great he is, how successful, how wonderful, blah, blah. She knows he tired of her and went to college across country to get away from her and now only sees her once or twice a year. Thus, the raison d'etre for the road trip--guilt.

It's hard to read Rogan's face, except for ticks and twists and blips. He's not a convincing actor. And poor Streisand has had so much plastic surgery, her face is shrunken. She looks weird (although, I must add, she does not have a wrinkle on her face and she must be 70 at least!).

There are two nice scenes toward the end which could have saved the movie, but they are wasted. They just do not have the power to erase the bad taste the previous hour gives. It's like licking an ice cream cone then the ice cream falls out. It's a tease, then it's disappointing.

I wish I could give one good reason to see this movie, but, alas, I cannot.",1367712000,,2435,4.424107142857143

5140512,5,B0087ITBT8,"This was a great gem of a film. Seth Rogen sure lucked out to have Barbra as his screen mom. She delivers an Oscar worthy performance within a film that could otherwise have been utterly forgettable.  She really does raise the caliber and content of this film, and even makes Seth look like a better actor than he truly is.  Her performance is heartwarming, nuanced and top-shelf.  it's like an acting master class.  Remember, there are no small parts, only small actors.  Actors with real talent, raise the caliber of every film and every part they play, which is exactly what Babs does here.

This is actually a perfect Mother's Day movie.  It's all about a mom who loves her boy to a fault, and knows best, even when it seems like she's downright loony. Very touching.  Buy it for your mom, then sit down and watch it with her.  You'll both love it.",1367712000,,852,4.48051948051948

The character Andy even wore the same shirt and has the exact same ""dry humor"" as my oldest son who is an Attorney at the age of 24 with his JD ( so proud.) I loved how Barbara S. was so comfortable in her ""ways"" of being single and still calling herself mommy to her son. I admit, I do too. She eats her M&M's in bed and told Andy that she really didn't want to date because she wants to be able to eat her M&Ms in bed....there were so so many things in the movie that I had to laugh at because they were so ""real"" and sweet at the same time. I liked how at the end, when Andy actually took his moms advice on the product he was ""touring"" that it really worked and won over the company. We care so much as parents and we have made our children our lives. When we have to live without them because they have grown and left, we sometimes do not even know what to do with ourselves and feel a deep sadness...is this the ""empty nest syndrome"" many speak of? I have just experienced this and so the movie was perfect for me right now. It isn't perhaps for everyone, for for many of us we can appreciate it and even share it with our kids so they can see where we are coming from. I shared it with my Andy and he liked it. He laughed and gave me a hug at the end :) We are proud of each other and I learned in this movie that it is okay to take on a new life when our kids grow up and leave.

5140538,5,B0087ITBT8,"THE GUILT TRIP is essentially a movie you might find on the Hallmark Channel or Lifetime minus the F-bomb scene.  The script is basic doting mother/nerdy son dilemma with occasional laughs and manipulative tears.  The one thing that elevates the film is the performances of Barbra Streisand (her first starring role in 16 years) and Seth Rogen.  The stars generate a marvelous chemistry.  Rogen plays Andy with a contained emotion just waiting to erupt.  Streisand gives perhaps her most honest and restrained performance ever.  Gone are the long fingernails and the glamour found in other roles.  This is not a diva performance---she shares rather than dominates the film.  I have always admired Barbra---a talented and incomparable performer.  Whether you like or dislike her personally, one cannot diminish the magnitude of her abilities.  She makes THE GUILT TRIP worth taking.",1367539200,2,881,5.273381294964029

5140546,4,B0087ITBT8,"A mother/son road trip movie is sort of an uncharted journey in the film world. That made this a very unique film from the start.. Based on an actual road trip that Fogelman took with his mother is probably what makes the movie so real. Streisand and Rogen have great chemistry and since the movie is 80% just them, that is a godsend. Joyce's constant need to interfere with Andy's life in almost every aspect drives him crazy until an explosion of unexpected drama on the part of mother and son. There are so many funny lines and situations that the theatre was filled with laughter often. The movie could also take a very serious, moving turn which can move you to tears.
 Streisand has always been an actress of immeasurable range from musicals (Funny Girl) to comedy (What's Up Doc?) to drama (The Way We Were) with each type being a blockbuster hit.  In her semi-retirement she works very seldom.  It took them a year to convince her to come back to her first lead role in many years.  Her Joyce is perhaps one of the most real characters she has ever played  Stripped of glamour she wears track shoes and sneakers.  She is just a regular mother who lives for the happiness of her son.  Rogen has rarely played such a straight character as Andy.  Anne Fletcher has brought out the best of them both.  The climatic showdown is pure real dramatic that Streisand delivers with a powerful punch that stuns the audience as much as Andy.
. I liked everything about this film and can't wait to see it again. Don't skip the end because there are a lot of clips after the credits of mother and son banter that is very funny.
This is a great film for parents and grown children. I wish my mother was still alive- I'd love to take her to see it.",1367107200,45,1739,4.392523364485982
5140547,2,B0087ITBT8,"My husband thought it was 'boring' and I felt it was dry. The advert was more entertaining as it happens!
This movie had its cute bits and yes, mom knows best,ey?! I think the producers were looking for ways to be a little Quentin Tarantino in terms of the few 'risky' incidents(e.g. bar incident)& the remarks made throughout the movie. Quite frankly only a few worked...:/ We moved on to an older movie tonight called 'Hidden Silence.' That was 5 stars in comparison! Seriously, The Guilt Trip was not worth watching. Possibly an actor who is a better complement for Barbara would have worked for this movie...imagine a Woodie Allen like personality and Barbara or something...just think this didn't work.

5140548,4,B0087ITBT8,"""The Guilt Trip"" is one of those simple little light dramas that is a sweet confection of a film. Seth is totally at ease working with entertainment icon Streisand. And Barbra's character, Joyce, is anything but a superstar. Barbra as Joyce is lovely and kind and vulnerable. And totally middle class! Note: Streisand, a stickler for detail, I'm sure designed her own makeup. No iconic Barbra Streisand movie star eyes; look closely for liquid eye-liner applied like Joyce would do! Barbra sparkles, Seth is deliciously befuddled as they look for love -- in their strained relationship and with long-lost love. What a charming pair! This film isn't going to make any big philosophical statement or change the world. It's just 90 minutes of low-key fun about a mother who adores her boy.",1366934400,11,786,4.962121212121212

His first stop is New York...and a visit with his mom (Streisand). When a conversation brings up old stories Andy decides to invite his mom to join him, which he regrets about 5 minutes in. I was looking forward to seeing this because the trailer reminded me of me and my own mom. I will say the movie wasn't as funny as I was hoping but it was still really funny and I do recommend this. Every mother and son should see this together, I saw a lot of similarities between me and mine throughout. Some lines I'm sure we have said over and over. The cast is perfect and Rogen and Streisand actually seem related. The end got a little sappy but overall this is a very funny movie. Overall, funny but I was also hoping for funnier. I do recommend seeing this though. I give it a B.",1366416000,18,1090,4.195238095238095
5140550,5,B0087ITBT8,"There are natural bonds between a mother and son. Likewise there are natural barriers that should not be crossed as adults, things that are better off not said. In this film Joyce (Barbra Streisand) and her son (Seth Rogen) break those barriers in this humorous and heart warming tale of a mother and son's road trip, one where they both do things out of love for the other one, that might make them ill at ease.

The film has great chemistry and dialouge. There were a few moments when the doting mom thing became too cliche, but it didn't last. Worth a view, worth owning.

When I get the movie after the end of april I will addd to this rating.
 Yes I watched it yesterday and yes indeed I love it. Barbra was funny  and the chemistry between she and Seth was perfect. They got along they had words and they found out they love each other. I wish my mom could have seen this one.

I've been in love with Barbra  my whole life (and I'm a Republican) so of course I'm gonna get the DVD.  This movie should have come out on Mother's Day and it would have made $100 million.  I think ""Parental Guidance"" stole some of the ""Guilt Trip"" audience.  Anyway buy this DVD.  Barbra has been a huge star for 50 years and will still be a huge star 50 years from now.

Through the set-up -- the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film -- I thought my expectations were confirmed, but I hung with it and found myself pleasantly surprised. Both actors dial down their usual schtick a notch or two and wind up delivering performances that are actually believable in a story many people should be able to relate to. It's not clear to me why this film was so negatively reviewed. Maybe it's because it doesn't operate on the fringes of reality and examines ordinary people having fairly ordinary experiences. Barbra Streisand's performance is a bit over the top at times, especially early in the film, but it almost had to be to set up the tension in the relationship that follows. This won't go down in any top 100 lists, but it is a sweet comedy about a mother and son that wisely, I think, avoids steering headlong into farce.",1514592000,,913,4.539393939393939
