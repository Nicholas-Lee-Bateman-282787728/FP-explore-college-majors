7277224,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"I cannot think of a better way of closing Phase 2 than with this movie. Humor and action are seamlessly blended in the manner for which Marvel has become so well-known. The fight scenes are masterfully choreographed to incorporate Ant-Man's shrinking power without once coming off as campy or cheesy. Every laugh is intentional in a movie that clearly has a very high awareness of itself. The acting was all fantastic, but in particular Michael Pea's performance had me rolling in my chair. Overall this movie was very reminiscent of last year's Guardians of the Galaxy, but, in my opinion, it was pulled off even better, with a stronger sense of plot and direction than Guardians had. This is far and away the most fun movie that has come out in a summer of exceptional movies. Anybody who loves Marvel has an obligation to treat themselves to this movie.",1437091200,139,856,4.751677852348993
7277225,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,Such a good movie. Poor guy is just trying to do right for his daughter and nothing seems to work out for him. I feel like the scientists give him way too much crap for needing his help like they do.,1535068800,,199,3.8780487804878048

7277243,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Many movies from the larger franchise are so focused on creating shock and awe that the would-be humorous and complex human elements get lost. For many of us, those things are what makes this kind of movie good, not the explosions, etc. While I've been less-than-enthralled with the Avengers series, I personally loved both Ant-Man and it's sequel (Ant Man and the Wasp). The central cast is perfect, I laughed throughout, and appreciated the more complex human relationships (relative to the franchise norm), which focused more on parent-child issues than romance.",1534291200,,565,5.21978021978022

7277258,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,We purchased this for a family movie night with grandchildren 12 and 19.  It was fun to watch with appropriate humor for all ages.  The acting was higher caliber than usually found in these type of films for 3 of the 4 major characters.,1533772800,,236,4.340909090909091

7277261,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,Good movie - nothing inappropriate for 12/13 year olds.  Some violence but nothing over the top.  The 'villain' scenes at the end can be a bit intense for younger kids because it is supposed to be scary.,1533772800,,203,4.45945945945946
7277262,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"I admit to seeing this movie with some reluctance, just because it did not sound like something I would typically enjoy.  But it's one of the Marvel movies, and I still have not seen one of those I thought was poorly done.  This one is strong on humor, with interesting characters.  Paul Rudd is a likeable actor, and it was fun to see Michael Douglas in a more playful role than usual.  The dialogue is witty, and the action frequent and fun.  I saw the second in this series this summer, and will probably buy that as well when it comes out on DVD or blu-ray.  The blu-ray does have some special features, with a bit about the actors and some ""how we did this"" segments.",1533686400,,672,4.2936507936507935
7277263,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,Loved this movie.  It is my favorite MCU movie now.  Paul Rudd as Any Man is so charming.  The movie is well acted.  The story and the special effects well done.,1533686400,,161,4.096774193548387

7277312,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Time after time I find myself waning in interest at the thought of another Marvel movie. They're so numerous and expansive its hard to find one you like when it's essentially the same story but who are we kidding we don't necessarily watch Marvel movies for their story. Ant-Man stars one of my favorite actors of all time Mr. Paul Rudd. Rudd's demeanor and attitude make him perfectly relate-able for the audience, plus his comic timing and history as a comic actor defiantly makes this one of the funnier Marvel movies with the jokes actually hitting and being funny. Of course your're gonna get AMPED-UP CGI and intense fight sequences but also this is the only part of the MCU with Dr. Hank Pymm played by none other than Michael Douglas and his daughter LOST star Evangeline Lilly as Hope Van Dyne. Oh and how could I forget Michael Pena, his character Ant-Man's buddy and the comic relief of the movie is hilarious again no doubt to his background in comedies. All and all 11/10 Would recommend to anyone you're trying to get into Marvel movies.",1532217600,,1051,4.655913978494624

7277357,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"The best superhero movies are The Dark Knight and Iron Man for the more serious and Ant-Man &  Thor: Ragnarok for the fun. Ant-Man is a movie you can watch over and over and always have a smile on your face. Michael Pea's character is one of the best thought of comic relief personalities that works where other movies fail. Probably successful because no movie has ever used an overly optimistic personality and every one is attracted to those traits. Paul Rudd also plays a very relatable character and behind every great man is a woman who is played perfectly by Evangeline Lilly. But a great movie is only as good as its story and this one is creative, witty, and exceptional.",1530748800,,680,4.573770491803279

It started with small glitches on the edges of the TV. Ater about 30 minutes in it started getting worse, glitches and pauses. Then about midway through the movie when it's starting to pick up. It freezes and I can't get any farther in the movie. When I go to screen selections and choose a scene ahead of where I stopped in an attempt to rewind it back. The scene doesn't even load. People wonder why the disc sales are going down the toilet, this copy is worthless. The quality is less than that of a burned downloaded copy. There's no artwork inside, downloadable copies, nothing. I need to emphasis, this review is not about the movie, everyone will have their own opinion on that. This is about the DVD only, and it is hands down the worst copy of a DVD I've ever bought in my life. I don't have the biggest collection, roughly 70-80 movies. But I feel confident in saying, I've never had this issue before. Thus leading to a 1 star, I wish I could go lower than that.

7277495,1,B00ZGDIGZ2,"A shadow of what could have been if Edgar Wright had been allowed to direct. I put off watching this for the longest because I heard from friends that it was mediocre. I'm rewatching all the MCU movies to get ready for Infinity War so I decided to rent this. This movie is the perfect example being so average that it's somehow worse than bad. Paul Rudd is stiff and feels like he's not being allowed to be as funny as he normally is in comedies. The editing is extremely basic, most scenes feel like they were cut together by a first year film student. There are three or four scenes that involve the MCU at large in this movie that feel out of place and shoehorned in as if to remind audiences that this is taking place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Michael Douglas is one of the few redeeming qualities of this movie. He plays Hank Pym fantastically. Michael Pena also deserves a nod but unfortunately most of his funniest scenes are robbed of their comedy by grade school editing that doesn't allow the jokes to land. It's such a shame, the character designs and basic plot are good (likely because Edgar Wright had completed Pre-Production before Marvel pushed him out) but everything else falls flat. It's a great idea that was executited in a way that I would call ""Agressively Average"". This movie is a perfect example of what happens when you let studio meddling water down something special. This movie is fine for a quick afternoon watch but is extremely forgettable. It's a shame too. With James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy and Ryan Coogler's Black Panther we can see the kind of amazing stories that can be told when Marvel allows directors to execute their vision and tell standalone stories that involve these interesting characters. Unfortunately with Ant Man, they parted ways with one of the most creative Directors of our time and hired a hack, Peyton Reed, to cobble together a blandly executed movie that mostly just serves to set up some events in Civil War.",1522540800,,1987,4.6477272727272725

7277543,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Another great Marvel movie.

Marvel brings forward another new superhero to their Cinematic Universe and it turns out to be a good one. Though I have to admit I do understand the risk. This movie came out some time after the epic success of Avengers 2 Age of Ultron and with that type of anticipation one does wonder if it could live up to the hype. Spider-Man is cool, but a guy who is the size of an ant sounds silly but thankfully this works out.

Interesting how its made to work. Just like in Guardians of the Galaxy, this comic-book series utilizes the hero's most modern incarnation instead of its original. Hank Pym is the originator of the particle that shrinks this distance between molecules yet keeps their properties intact. But its Scott Lang, ex-convict with a conscience and a cause to help others that leads him to be a successor to the original Ant-Man. His job is to assist Hank Pym in preventing his work being exploited by a greedy, ambitious, former colleague.

This was interesting in that it was a superhero story but also a heist story on the level of Oceans 11 or the Italian Job with the thief being the good guy. Having seen actor Paul Rudd doing comedic roles, it certainly was a surprise seeing be a superhero. Michael Douglas was amazing as Hank Pym. Though I do love Evangeline Lilly for her work on TV's Lost and the Hobbit Trilogy, not really sold on her performance as Hope Pym as it wreaks of radical feminism. Yeah, it would be great to have a female superhero but for goodness sake don't make it emasculating. One of the most irredeemable flaws of the character, along with her daddy issues.

I definitely enjoyed Rudd's silly, yet capable partners in crime played by TI, David Dastmalchian and Michael Pea. Corey Stoll played a pretty standard but still pretty sold villain.

Not bad for a movie that had some difficulty getting off the ground but still did a great job. Great picture quality too, the IMAX looks great whenever the shrinking scenes are done for the film. Happy to have this on Blu-Ray and Digital Copy.",1518739200,,2058,4.581521739130435

Even though I am major creeped out by ants, I have watched this film more than once. Marvel did an awesome job of bringing Ant man into the M universe.

The plot was a bit formulaic as well, but we must give credit where credit is due for sticking absolutely to the Marvel canon for this one. It's fun and kind of funny, but rather too low-key.

7277623,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"A marvel hero movie for sure, but it is done much more in the style of a caper type of movie. Break into a place, steal a thing from the bad guy for the good of all (Instead of self, ya know, hero type movie as well)
The characters are fun and like a comic book movie should be, funny as well. A bit silly in scenes but not enough to take you out of the fantasy. It is a good romp of a guy that is trying to do the right thing but finds that is both not easy and not popular.
If you are a fan of other Marvel offerings then you are very likely to enjoy this movie as I did and my family. I have seen all of the other characters based on Marvel characters and this is one of the best of the batch.",1509494400,3,696,3.6778523489932886

From start to finish, the movie is  an extremely fun ride. The whole cast is excellent. And the script is just enough tongue in cheek  to set it aside from most superhero films. As with the dark Knight, civil war and the wonder woman movie, this one stands out because  it is simply a good movie. Lots if likeable characters, simple plot that works. Very clever writing.  Special effects are fine. But it is the character writing that pulls you in. It just happens to also be a superhero film.  Just a word about the seller.

7277694,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"I decided to skip this movie when it first came out because of the hype but I wish I hadn't. This is the best Marvel movie I've ever seen! Paul Rudd makes a better superhero than Ben Affleck and I wish they had chosen him for other superhero roles much sooner. Rudd's comedic timing is impeccable and he's very likeable because he gives Ant-Man a very human quality than most superheroes seem to lack. I know that sounds strange because superheroes are...well, super human. But when you can relate to a character, it makes them much more endearing. The story is flawless and they even wove in some parts for the Avengers, which fans will appreciate. This movie redeems Disney for the outdated Honey, I Shrunk the Kids series. This is also a film I can watch with my kids, which makes it even better.",1500681600,,799,4.517241379310345

Paul Rudd is a funny guy, and he plays the role well.  The supporting actors are well cast and the ""Disintegration"" bit is hilarious.  We now have another piece of the Infinity Wars puzzle, and Ant-Man will undoubtedly play a (tiny?  huge?) part in the upcoming Avengers movies.",1494288000,,553,4.729166666666667

Paul Rudd is a good actor..He got charm and the power to be funny in that charm. I like Michael Pena (Observe and Report) ,An actor I would like to see win an award due to he has many acting voices. Oakley had a product placement of there cool book bags..How does that make it a good movie..it doesn't! This movie is all amount timing..The bad guy was too much Metro Sexual with a odd voice. not sure why they went in that direction. Maybe his looks..he did have a good look for the bad guy..(might rewrite a few lines of his,change some of the emotional content) . But they do go with Fight Club style of film making in part. Michael Douglas is a seasoned pro..still my fav movie of his is Falling Down..Cult classic..Then you have Kate ""Evangeline Lilly"" ..doing great action sequences. Bobby Cannavale I liked him in Paul Blart allot..this is an actor..i want him to have his own movie..and be a big hit..I like how he delivers lines..has a sharp whit about him..When you see this..his part..and it being Bobby ..he added something that another actor in that role..wouldn't pull it off so well.

Read the other reviews for confirmation. If you enjoy iron man and avengers, you'll enjoy this - even if you didn't enjoy Thor or Captain America. Ant-man is more on par with Iron man.

7277861,1,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Enjoyable movie, but....

in the comic book his name was Hank Pym.  They should have given him that name and made Michael Douglas his uncle or other relative and Evangeline should have been his wife or girlfriend or love interest from the get-go -- with no children.

Who in their right mind wants to be involved with his former wife who's sleeping with another man?  She made her choice to abandon him in the bad times as most women do.  His daughter can come and visit by court orders at specified times without the wife or her new boyfriend in the picture.

Adding a kid to a superhero movie complicates it exceedingly.  So a bad move by Hollywood.

Evangeline is a lovely lady, but as in her Hobbit role, there's not a single feminine bone in her body.

I'm tired of the Hollywood's B.S. having women beat the daylights out of guys just because.  I don't care  how much training in martial arts they have.
It's not enough that they're making women stronger than men but they try to make them smarter than men and then their dialogue throughout the movie makes them nothing more than battleax termagants.

She's rude to her father and to anybody she deems unworthy of her company.  Why would anyone want to kiss a woman like that even if the mission succeeds at the end of the flick?

I'm just sick of seeing women  being portrayed as men and emasculated men hen-pecked by any female they happen  to meet.  If he was being thrown around by the She-Hulk, I could understand or by the Black Widow.  But by a cold, battle-ax lizard?  Her hairstyle, her manner, the way she dressed, her voice and her attitude, I found repellent.  Basically, she was a man disguised as a woman.

Anyway, what good is a superhero if he can get pasted by an ordinary women?  (Learning martial arts does not make you a superhero.  Bruce was close, though.)

Bruce Lee had to work long and hard for many years to get as good as he was, but Hollywood with the stroke of a pen gives every woman the same ability -- hogwash.

A very stupid script.

You've got to hand it to Disney.  If you want any story, book, comic book, or anything corrupted let them get their mitts on it.  Remember John Carter of Mars?  Same with ant-man and all the super-hero movies they've released.  Nothing matches as it should.  The reason is they use these stories to push their indoctrination -- their beliefs on how they view the world or want it be.  If they would get out of politics and focus on making movies according  to how they were written by the authors, they would be doing themselves and the public a good service.

Hollywood, though, has decided to take the path of the Dodo bird and to follow the lemmings in front of them off the cliff.

Here's an example of a major error in the movie:

When ant-man is on the helicopter and is being followed by the keystone cops. How can they see that far at night and see the ant-man dangling from the chopper if they didn't even know Lang was ant-man?

It couldn't be because of Pym, although that the was reason they showed up in the first place, because he was being treated by the ambulance which they were standing next to.

Then to add insult to injury, the pilots get killed and the helicopter  goes crazy and heads towards an unknown location.  There's no way the cops could have followed that chopper at that point.

But there's more:

Ant-man and the villain are trapped in the briefcase that falls out of the chopper (high in the sky and at night) and into a swimming pool, and the keystone cops find him?  Are you kidding me?! (lol)  Again, children writing ridiculous and unbelievable stories.  There's no one way they could have known where that briefcase fell -- impossible.  That's like trying to find, you know what, in the haystack.

And when Lang uncovers his face after they find him, they  act surprised even though they identified him at night and masked hanging way up from a chopper.

I mean what other reason would they have to  follow the helicopter other than Pym or Lang?  And Pym was on a gurney nearby.

First of all, ant-man (since he's not portrayed as Hank Pym) should have been single (like most superheroes) and without kids and the pair of keystone cops should never have been part of the story.  This pair of bungling cops were out of place in every scene they were in.

Tell me.  What good is a superhero if he can be stopped by ordinary cops?

There are a few other illogical parts but this will suffice.

Hollywood is the only industry I know of that can't read.  Not even a 32 page comic book.

The special effects were top of the line, but it takes more than special effects to make a really outstanding movie.

It's a corrupted and unrealistic sci-fi fantasy.

Michael Douglas:  Mature, Cool & Confident

Evangeline Lily:  Great as Cold, Arrogant, Termagant

Paul Rudd:  Perfect as Ant-Man

Michael Pena:  Hilarious, Perfect for the role

Villains:  Well cast & and easy to dislike.

Pena and Rudd had great chemistry.

Douglas and Rudd had very good chemistry.

There was no chemistry between Lily and Rudd.  It
just didn't work.  She was too masculine.  Too reptilian.

Hollywood is about to fall on its own sword, soon.

7277915,2,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Movie itself gets a 5 star, and this Blu-ray would too if it were not for this incredibly horrible implementation of a disk.

There are 4 audio tracks available in the language menu.
1. 7.1 surround audio, which my system can't decode.
2. Stereo English with descriptive voice over, which I'm sure is awesome for blind people.
3. French 5.1...... Ok.  Not helpful but it works on my setup.
4. Spanish 4.1........ Also not helpful.

And that's it.  So if you don't have a modern sound system that can decode 7.1 you are screwed....

I like how Hank Pym is a mentor here and leaves to Scott Lang, which is more original than a stereotypical origin movie. Then of course are the heist themes and being in jail actually relevant to it: getting fired from Baskin Robbins and Hank needing someone to break into and get the Yellowjacket suit.

I've seen most of the Marvel movies, but I only own 4 - Iron Man, Winter Soldier, The Avengers, and this. I think the humor is genuinely funny, Paul Rudd does a good job balancing the hero/goofus role, and the script is clever in its balancing of Father/Daughter relationships. It's got a good heart, and it is alternately thrilling and funny. Relettermedia described it as ""Manufactured Fun,"" and I agree with that - it's a good time. Enjoy!",1481846400,,536,4.59375

7278058,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"As Marvel continues to release movies, I am realizing how few of their characters Id even heard of.  For example, Ant-Man hadnt even crossed my radar until I heard the film was in development.  But, since Ive been enjoying the Marvel movies and knew it would be part of the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe, I planned to watch it.

Our hero this time is Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), a man with a past.  Specifically, we meet him on the day he gets out of jail for time he spent after stealing money from a former employer to give back to those who had lost money with the company.  This brands him as a hero to some but still makes it very hard to find a job that pays enough to live on and pay the child support he needs to pay in order to be in his daughters life.

Which is why Scott finally gives in and joins his former cell mate Luis (Michael Pena) on a robbery job.  However, when he gets into the vault, he just finds a strange costume.  He decides to try it on and next thing he knows, hes shrunk to a very small size.

It turns out the suit was created by Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), who wants to recruit Scott to use it to help him stop Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) from using the technology for evil.  The two team up with Dr. Pyms daughter Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), who isn't sure this is a good idea.  Can Scott learn to use the powers of the suit before it is too late?

Honestly, I must admit I wasn't sure what to think about this movie before going in.  A man who shrinks to the size of an ant?  Yes, ants are powerful, but is it really that great a power?  Turns out, it really is.  This movie is a lot of fun, and they use his powers to great advantage over the course of the film.  The science of it all is probably questionable, but it sounded logical enough to me when I was watching it, and I don't care about the rest.

Ant-Man isn't just because Scott shrinks down.  Ants are a regular feature of the movie, and I actually like how the various types of ants are incorporated into the film.  If you don't like bugs, you will find this a little creepy, but for the most part this is enjoyable as well.

Because of the size adjustments that Scott goes through, we get even more special effects than normal for a superhero film, or at least different types of special effects.  I actually enjoyed seeing the world from an ants perspective, and I found all the effects completely believable.  The size differences actually make for some fun and creative action scenes that I really enjoyed.

The acting is strong as well, with the cast doing a great job of bringing their characters to life.  The main trio of Scott, Dr. Pym, and Hope are wonderful characters.  While their story arcs are fairly predictable here, I still got caught up in the story rooting for them.  Scotts relationship with this daughter is wonderful, and makes a great motivation for his character.

Unfortunately, this movie does fall into the first movie of a superhero franchise trap.  It spends so much time on the origins and we know all those beats already.  Granted, since I don't know the characters at all, I did need to know what we learned here, so its a very hard line to walk.  I definitely did feel that the villain was short changed; hes a very two-dimensional character.

On the other hand, the references to the Avengers was a lot of fun, and a great way to tie in to the larger movie franchise.  There are also some great one-liners that made me laugh.  This sense of fun is one reason I keep coming back to the Marvel movies.

Now that Ive met Ant-Man, Im anxious to learn more about him.  Im looking forward to seeing him pop up in more movies and even getting his own sequel in a couple of years.  Thats pretty big stuff for such a small guy.",1479081600,,3759,4.2733711048158645

7278109,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"I read the relatively few issues of Ant-Man in Marvel Comics as a kid and really took to the novel concept of a small super hero who can enlist the help of any species of ant using telepathic control. His ""powers"" are a nice contrast with the brute force of Thor and the Hulk; Ant-Man was a bit more thoughtful in his approach to defeating his adversaries than that of the other Marvel super heroes. That theme is preserved and expanded upon in the screen version of the Ant-Man's story. Paul Rudd's performance as the super hero with a troubled past is understated yet invitingly human. Michael Douglas is spot-on and a very powerful on-screen presence as Henry Pym, former Ant-Man now retired and looking to Rudd's character as his successor. Evangeline Lilly is absolutely great as the very cynical female lead who proves to be more than Ant-Man's alter ego can handle. (Spoiler alert: The extra content after the credits have rolled hints at a tie-in with the next Avengers flick, ""Civil Are"".)

Well, this one seems to be a blend of the two, at least in my opinion.  I saw it On-Demand recently, and had to buy it.  As soon as it arrived from Amazon I watched it again.  It is really cute, funny, and action packed (but not hideously violent).  I love the characters--especially Paul Rudd, but also LOVED Michael Pena.  I agree with what  TM Massage's review said--almost word-for-word!  I too was going to skip this one, although I liked the other comic movies.  I loved the lip-sync parts too and had to watch them over a couple times just to enjoy them more!  This was great without the bosom and bun shots too!  Overall it is a really great movie, and one of my favorites (PS: Knight and Day is another recent one you might want to check out--I love it too).",1477094400,5,998,4.398907103825136

7278225,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Of all the Marvel movies that have been released this decade, I consider this the best one by far.  Unlike the two Avengers movies, there is no grand threat to Earth that seems copied from dozens of other sci-fi movies to have come out over the decades.  Instead, we have a more believable and pragmatic danger; a new type of technology that is being sold at the highest bidder specifically for military and policing operations.  Unlike the Thor and Captain America movies, there are no aliens or super-humans here.  Instead, we have intelligent human beings who are engaged in a battle to control the break-through technology.  Subsumed in this are corporate rivalries, old family disputes, and marital disputes also.  The onscreen chemistry between all the cast members is great, with bits of comedy thrown in by many of them to keep things upbeat among the backdrop of lethal combat.  Even these latter fight scenes often come across as part slapstick in their portrayal, whether it be among the contents of a suitcase, to atop a child's play table.  Paul Rudd is great as the leading role, part Robin Hood criminal, part-time father, and a great engineer.  Evangeline Lily has probably her best lead actress role yet, and in one of the year's biggest movies.  And Michael Douglas does great in the supporting role of a wizened old man who realizes that with great power comes great responsibility.  The lead cast members are complemented well with a bevy of supporting actors and actresses.  The only drawback was that our main villain, Darren Cross, looks eerily similar to DC's principal villain of Lex Luther.... what is it about baldness that indicates evil?

This Blu-Ray comes with some extended and deleted scenes; too bad they were not added to the movie to make a longer cut.  The film and sound quality is pristine, and there is a bevy of special features to keep the die-hard fans entertained for hours.  Overall, this is a great movie and good pickup.",1474070400,,1967,4.829850746268657

If they made a second movie I would watch it. I also enjoyed them incorporating Peggy Carter and the Falcon(which was only for a brief moment but still), I think that the wasp would be a cool movie to watch(for those who watch the very end credits). I re-watch some movies and this is one movie that I would watch again. I don't think this move compares to Iron Man or any of the other big movies out there.

7278296,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"This was the movie I expected to be Marvel/Disney's first MCU flop. Not only was I wrong about that, thank goodness, but I'm surprised at how thrilling and funny it remains. I hope DC/WB has learned the lesson: You don't need the most famous (or ""iconic"") superheroes to make a great superhero movie. In fact, you might be better off with an obscure one. You can use a superhero nobody's ever heard of, and if the cast, crew, and director put their hearts into making it work, it can be a surprising and refreshing joy. I have seen others criticize this movie for the villain, Darren Cross/Yellowjacket, not being very well characterized. But I maintain that part of the MCU's strength is that the heroes themselves take center stage, and the villains are always secondary. I prefer that approach.

I was happy to see Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man appear in Captain America: Civil War, and I can't wait for him to share the lead with Evangeline Lilly in the upcoming sequel, Ant-Man and The Wasp.

I like the version of this movie that got made. I don't waste time wondering what would have happened if Edgar Wright had stayed on the project. The end result is a good movie anyway!",1472342400,,1183,4.601895734597156

Ant-Man is cool in a comic book sense but I just had a feeling that this film would be far too campy and not very compelling. I was wrong. This is one of the best Marvel titles to come out into the MCU. Rudd is fantastic as Ant-Man and his portrayal sets the character up as an integral part of the MCU rather than a masked man who is out of place with the likes of Iron Man and Captain America. True, he's a little out of his league in the larger context of things because he's a little bit of a slacker and a goof, but he's also pretty daring and he has the suit much like Tony Stark does.",1471564800,,656,3.8666666666666667

I think Edgar Wright would've made a much better film. This is just very forgettable. And Hank Pym is Ultrons daddy. Not Tony Stark.

It has it over-the-top supervillain moments and some father-daughter melodrama, but the humor elsewhere offsets that and makes it watchable. Also, there is some neat camerawork when Rudd is ant-sized that make this feel a bit different/more fresh than a lot of the superhero flicks flooding the market today.",1469491200,,457,5.1891891891891895

I donate all the movies I buy to my local library as to provide the community and vacationers quality entertainment.  PAUL RUDD IS AMAZING!  PAUL RUDD PULLED IT OFF!

7278433,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"It's a fun movie. There's enough of an edge that it doesn't feel like a kid's movie, but it's still got a sense of playfulness that works.
It's also a mashup of several different movie genres. Everyone's talked about it being a heist movie and a shrinking movie, but there are also serious echos of ""The Santa Clause"" and ""Liar, Liar.""
The overall story arc is about a guy who's lost his family by screwing up and redeems himself with supernatural/fantastic/impossible stuff serving as the catalyst..
Michael Douglas is adequate, Paul Rudd is good, Hope Van Dyne is meh, Michael Pena steals the show every time he's on screen, Abby Fortson was cute and perfect for her part as the child. Corey Stoll was kind of a generic ""villain of the week,"" but this movie wasn't about the villain. Poor Judy Greer got the thankless ""wife who's husband has screwed up and she's got to act like the adult who's trying to mend the relationship"" role.",1469318400,,935,4.63855421686747

7278525,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"3.5 Stars. (Spoiler Alert!) Marvel is back with another movie tied into their ever expanding universe. This time Paul Rudd dons the costume in an Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, The Worlds End, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World) screenplay and was under the direction of Peyton Reed (Bring It On, The Break-Up, Yes Man). Rudd plays Scott Lang, a cat burglar whos trying to change his ways so he can continue to see his daughter. Getting roped back into crime by his crew, he stumbles upon Dr. Pyms (Michael Douglas) special suit. Pym, against his daughters wishes, asks Lang to become Ant-Man, who can shrink to size of an ant but have superhuman strength, and save the world. They develop an elaborate heist with the help of a variety of ants, Pym, Pyms daughter, and his old crew to steal the technology that Pym has kept a secret but his former colleague has finally developed and wants to sell. With little time to spare, after Wright dropped out of the project over creative differences and there was a director change, the movie was thrown together in no time. Much like Guardians of the Galaxy, this is on the lighter-side down to the hilarious fight at the end. Unlike Guardians of the Galaxy and the rest of the Marvel movies with their over-the-top action, plot, and premise, this movie is simply a heist film. This makes it all the better, as they didn't level any cities or do any mass-destruction. The first Iron Man is closest this simplicity. The cast of Ant-man was great. Paul Rudd, known for comedies and romance movies, full on enters the superhero world in the Marvel universe. He even has a tussle with one Avenger and will be appearing in the Captain America: Civil War. Douglas does a fabulous job as Dr. Pym, and it was nice to see him young again for the opening scene with the same technology they used in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Michael Pena takes the cake as Langs friend, with his long winded and humorous stories that take forever to get to the point. The latter of the two has Stan Lees best cameo yet. Where the movie falls a step or two is the abbreviated training scene. It reminded me of the abbreviated action sequence in the first Captain America, which I thought were horrid because I wanted to see the action, not clips of it. They could have expanded these scenes a little, but I understand for time they wanted to move forward quickly. Of course they tie the move to the others expanding the Marvel universe. Its definitely worth the watch and is a great summertime film.",1468454400,,2530,4.562637362637362

""Ant Man"" is the perfect companion piece for ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", both movies move along at a great pace, they are witty, humorous, have appealing characters and they both have massive big hearts. Applause for Paul Rudd , he perfectly fitted the role of Scott Lang, the rest of the cast shone as well.

7278543,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Humor and action are seamlessly blended in the manner for which Marvel has become so well-known. The fight scenes are masterfully choreographed to incorporate Ant-Man's shrinking power without once coming off as campy or cheesy. Every laugh is intentional in a movie that clearly has a very high awareness of itself. The acting was all fantastic, but in particular Michael Pea's performance had me rolling in my chair. Overall this movie was very reminiscent of last year's Guardians of the Galaxy, but, in my opinion, it was pulled off even better, with a stronger sense of plot and direction than Guardians had. This is far and away the most fun movie that has come out in a summer of exceptional movies. Anybody who loves Marvel has an obligation to treat themselves to this movie.",1467936000,,784,4.858208955223881

7278548,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"I liked this movie. I didn't love it.

The story is good. The acting is good. The special effects are good. It's a decent super hero story.

I like how they interwove the story into the Avengers storyline. Seeing Stark Industries and the Iron Man references everywhere is cool.

Whoever made Michael Douglas look 25 years younger in the opening scene should have won an Oscar. I don't know is that's make up or CGI or both but my goodness.....he absolutely looked like he was about 45 years old at the most. And it was 100% believable visually. There were no signs of special effects or make up at all. (I know it was a special effect, but you couldn't tell)

The problem was Paul Rudd. He is awesome in general. I just don't think he was right for this particular role. Rudd's strength as a comedy actor is his ability to play off of the other actors on set and ad lib his lines to make the scene flow better. But in a super hero movie with a lot of stunts and special effects, its' not as easy to deviate from the script as written because of timing issues. It's a role that doesn't play to Rudd's strengths.

Still, the movie was entertaining. I watched it and enjoyed myself. But I don't think I'd ever need to see it again.

If you love super hero movies, enjoy the Avengers / Captain America / Iron Man sagas....it's well worth 2 hour of your life. If you're just  Paul Rudd fan and have loved him since Clueless, that shouldn't be the reason to watch this one as Rudd isn't doing his normal thing in this one.

If you like superhero movies but aren't fully up to date with the whole Avengers / Captain America Ironman Civil War thing.....Ant Man does stand on its. It references other Marvel storylines, but you don't really need to be familiar with them to follow the story. Ant Man doesn't hinge on any outside knowledge of the Avengers.",1467763200,,1846,4.37719298245614
7278549,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Mark Zuckerberg once said the biggest risk is not taking any risk  In a world that is changing really quickly, the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks. Marvel Film Franchise Overseer Kevin Feige and the Powers That Be at Marvel and Disney must subscribe to Zuckerbergs line of thinking as they continue to roll the dice with their ever-expanding cinematic universe; the latest release, its 12th, Ant-Man represents the biggest risk to date. Standing next to the other heroes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, there was potential for Ant-Man to come off looking small (pun, so intended). However, Marvel once again defied the superhero genre with a tale of redemption, fathers and daughters, and heroism (of course) packaged as a heist flick.

Director Peyton Reed, best known for light comedies The Break-Up, Down With Love and Bring It On, became yet another unorthodox selection to introduce, this time, a C-list superhero from the Marvel catalog. Reed does a masterful job of injecting in his own flavor, which is evident in the films humorous tone at times.

Performing against type, Paul Rudd plays it straight as Scott Lang, the burglar ex-con who is trying to do right by his daughter. Rudd, who is a mastermind at making audiences laugh, could have easily been tempted to play Lang with humor as his world becomes a part of the Avengers universe. Instead, Rudd plays Lang very confidentially and matter-of-fact, allowing his crew to mine the film for its sillier moments. It is an important choice for both Reed, Rudd and Marvel, as the film could have careened into shlock and parody but instead remains grounded in reality, which is vital for the continued success of future films.

While the films protagonist is Lang and his quest to become a better father for his daughter, Cassie, it is another father-daughter relationship that really steals the show. Michael Douglas Dr. Hank Pym and his daughter, Evangeline Lillys Hope Van Dyne, provide the story with its true redemption and love, as she felt shunned by her father from years of distance. Ant-Mans story allows both to reconcile and grow closer together by the films end.

Corey Stoll adds a terrific turn as Darren Cross, playing the role of protagonist and ostracized protege of Pym. Similarly to Thor, where Loki continues to seek Odins approval, Cross appears to always be seeking his former mentors praise, while turning into the very monster Pym feared, you are too much like me.

Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that seat, Captain Kirk explained to Captain Harriman in Star Trek Generations, as William Shatner passed the torch to a new group of actors and characters. Marvel continues to sit in the captains chair at the cinema, because it continues to take risks.",1467676800,,2781,4.88135593220339

7278682,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"I always like a decent heist movie, and thank god they combined a heist movie with Marvel.  This movie is a great example as to what Marvel does differently from the DC movie universe, they at least try to make it funny.  The personality of the movie comes at the expense of the plot and especiallyhow information is disseminated.  After learning about how much of the Iron Man movie was improvised (google the recent article with Jeff Bridges) and that setting the tone for the whole universe, this almost seems like they were trying to recapture that magic, and they came close.  Thank God, Paul Rudd plays the earnest douchbag character well, as that Scott Lang exemplifies both of those qualities.  This, while not being the best Marvel movie (That honor goes to Guardians Of The Galaxy) is still a fun ride, and a great part of the Marvel universe.",1466208000,,853,4.66

7278707,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"An enjoyable heist movie. Rather than yet another round of city-destroying chaos, this is a comic book movie that actually feels human, with refreshingly low stakes and a real sense of fun. Corey Stoll's standard-issue corporate bad guy is a little underdeveloped and the plot mechanics probably don't withstand scrutiny very well (I'm still not really clear on how shrinking is supposed to make you stronger), but it's a good time if you're willing to not think about it too much and just go with it.",1465948800,,501,4.837209302325581

There was so much build up that the ""super hero"" part seemed more like a happy accident. Which I suppose might have been what they were going for but it doesn't match the feel of the other Marvel movies.

7278779,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"I really liked this movie. Paul Rudd landed his jokes, the suit was pretty cool, and it was fun to watch. I was a bit concerned about Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas from the Trailer, but by the end of the movie I had come around.

Bobby Canavale deserves a special mention. His portrayal of his character was excellent. I was very frustrated trying to decide if I liked or disliked him, because they (purposefully I believe) made it a little unclear if he was being a jerk, or was genuinely concerned for the welfare of Scott's ex-wife and daughter.

Overall the writing, acting and directing all were great, and of course Marvel's mastery of special effects was not lost. Plus the Avengers Cameo hilariously matches the X-Men Cameo from Deadpool.

A+ for good action, provoking empathy to the characters, and keeping me frustrated trying to figure out some things. Plus the comic relief was brilliant.",1465430400,,908,4.8076923076923075

Main issue is that someone decided that Glock pistols will somehow grow visible hammers so that ants can disable them.

Dear Hollywood,  Glock pistols don't have hammers.  Have never had hammers.  Probably never will have hammers.  They don't make ""hammer cocking noises"". They don't have safeties that you click off.  And they certainly wouldn't be disabled by ants holding on to a non-existent hammer.

Plot was great given how ludicrous the concept is, it was nicely emotional (great tear jerk scent between Lily and M Douglas) and Rudd breaks it - so funny. The action is fun, crazy and nutty (Large tank, ants and Thomas the train). Great movie, great addition to the MCU. Go AntMan.",1464998400,2,665,4.6440677966101696

I really enjoyed the premise of the story line and how Paul Rudd's character developed along with the plot.  You literally saw him evolve into a hero. This is a really fun movie to watch. It has some violence but not near what most movies have.  I don't think very young kids could go but I think late elementary school kids could go without too much trouble.  The best thing to do is screen it before your kid sees it.  Either way, if you like super hero movies, I know you will like this movie.

It had a bit more of a comedic feel than most superhero movies which was what I was hoping for. I'm kind of getting tired of a lot of the superhero stuff with over the top action and destruction and high death tolls. I wanted to see this since I enjoy Paul Rudds comedy and I don't want to miss anything in Civil War!

Paul Rudd is a down-on-his-luck anti-bank crusader who lands in prison, losing everything.  As he tried to rebuilt his life he runs into the machinations of the Marvel Universe, including John Slattery and Haley Attwell.  Finding himself in the hands of the resident mad scientist, played by Michael Douglas, the hapless Ant-Man faces Corey Stoll, still in a snit due to the cancellation of Law & Order LA.

7278976,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"When I originally saw the first footage for Marvels Ant-Man, I have to admit I wasn't exactly hyped to see the film on opening night. I always thought that Paul Rudd was a perfect casting choice to bring the larger than life character to the big screen, but the first few trailers just didn't grab my attention and it seemed like the movie was having trouble finding its tone. Was this going to be an all-out comedy, or balance things out with a healthy dose of action and drama  la last years Guardians of the Galaxy? Thankfully, the finished product turned out to be one of Marvels most entertaining and original films to date, wrapping up Phase 2 nicely.

Paul Rudd knocks it out of the park in this immensely enjoyable action/comedy superhero film from Marvel Studios. Scott Lang (Rudd), a master thief with a heart of gold, teams up with Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) to stop a powerful weapon from getting into the hands of the malevolent Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), Pyms former protege. Armed with the amazing shrinking and strength-boosting abilities of Pyms Ant-Man suit, Lang aims to right the wrongs of his past and become a hero in the eyes of his daughter. If he can succeed, The Avengers might just have a spot open for him on their team.

Its obvious from the outset of  the film why Paul Rudd was chosen for the role  hes one of few very actors who could make a criminal charming, and his spot-on comedic timing and chemistry with Michael Pena provide some of Ant-Mans most memorable moments. Evangeline Lilly plays the part of Pyms estranged daughter Hope quite well, offering up a few moments of badassery as she teaches Scott how to fight and use his newfound abilities. Michael Douglas plays the part of Dr. Hank Pym beautifully  you could feel the characters sense of despair and regret about the events that caused both Hope and Darren Cross to distance themselves from him. And Corey Stoll plays Darren Cross with an intensity that really sells the characters descent into madness, as he stops at nothing to recreate the Ant-Man technology just to sell it on the black market. The character may be a bit one-dimensional, but Stoll makes Cross both memorable and intimidating.
The first thing that caught my attention with Ant-Man were the impressive visual effects. The shrinking abilities of Ant-Man are well portrayed, allowing the audience to suspend disbelief long enough to become invested in Scotts story. Aspects such as the digitally recreated bathroom where Scott first utilizes his shrinking powers are overflowing with detail, right down to the texture on the tiles, the grimy grout, and spiderwebs between the floorboards. It really helps sell the illusion, as you never feel as though Rudd is running in front of a green screen (although thats obviously what happened).

Perhaps the most effective and remarkable use of CGI in Ant-Man is the de-aging effect used for Michael Douglas in flashback scenes  he looks just how youd remember him from 80s films like Wall Street. A kickass battle against Falcon at Avengers HQ manages to effectively showcase Ant-Mans abilities and paint him as a formidable fighter that could stand beside Captain America and Thor on the team. I should also mention that once again Marvel Studios costume designers are amazing; the Ant-Man suit from the original comics is difficult to translate to the big screen, but they absolutely nailed it, and the Yellowjacket suit may be even cooler.
Ant-Mans Digital HD copy features extras like a gag reel, deleted scenes, and featurettes on the creation of the CGI sequences. Theres also a bit of backstory on the comic characters origins and some commentary on the deleted scenes from the director and Paul Rudd. One of the deleted scenes, in which Scott Lang cases Pyms house as a cable guy, was truly great and had me wondering why it was left on the cutting room floor.
Overall, Ant-Man is a surprising success  after the first trailer was met with a tepid reaction from fans, Marvel and director Peyton Reed managed to turn the tide and give us one of the most memorable and creative films in their lineup (and one of my new personal favorites). Im thrilled to see lesser-known and more out-there characters like Ant-Man and Guardians of the Galaxy not only making their way to the silver screen, but finding great critical acclaim and financial success. As a longtime comic fan, I cant wait to see Scott Lang teaming up alongside the Avengers (and Spider-Man!) in Captain America: Civil War  its one of those things I thought would never actually happen, and the kid in me couldn't be more ecstatic.",1464048000,29,4613,4.813131313131313

My 16 year old son, husband, and I all really enjoyed Ant Man; it was a lot of fun.  Will it win an Academy Award? No, but some of those Academy Award winning movies are awful and not acceptable for a nice, family evening.

7279067,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"I admit when I first saw the trailer for Ant-Man, I was not that impressed. A suit that allows the wearer to shrink and command ants? Admittedly, I found it odd and wasn't attracted to the premise. However, after seeing the character make an appearance in Civil War, I was intrigued and then decided to give his solo film a try. I was not disappointed.

The character development was a little flat, but I still enjoyed the character of Scott Lang, his love of his daughter was a good motivation and his intelligence was clear. And the ""I have a master's degree, I'll be fine"" which instantly cut to him working at Baskin Robins was so accurate it made me laugh.

The relationship between Dr. Pym and his daughter was a little shallow for me, tried to be deep, complex and emotional and fell flat. Scott's making their supposed ""heartfelt"" reuion awkward was certainly cringe-inducing for me. Ending was interesting and certainly explained why he appeared in Civil War.

Enjoyable film, not one of the greatest Marvel has ever done, but it certainly stood on it's own and Scott Lang certainly made for an interesting superhero.",1463702400,,1126,4.73469387755102

7279088,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"The Ant-Man movie had a great blend of action and comedy that just pulls you in from beginning to end.  Paul Rudd did an awesome job making the character Scott Lang charismatic and relatable, while adding a different, funner vibe of humor to the Marvel movies universe.  Despite being mostly known as a rom-com actor, he definitely can hold his own as an action star in this movie.  The supporting cast in this film is great too.  I especially enjoy the characters and interactions of Scott Lang's little entourage of ex-criminals; they're just so fun to watch!

I personally have never read the comics or even knew about Ant-Man, but I definitely enjoyed the movie very much and want to see more of this character and his story.",1463529600,8,729,4.6640625

When I first heard of trouble for the long anticipated Ant-Man, and the people that were originally attached were no longer involved, I was concerned. However, Marvel knows their characters, and they have been building the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) with fluidity in mind. I had some initial doubts about a character not too many people are familiar with, and although I love Paul Rudd, I felt his comedic roles would be a hindrance. I was wrong. From the moment I saw the trailer, I was hooked. I have now seen this movie multiple times, and it is not only one of my favorites, but the other members of the household (even those that do not like superhero movies) liked it a lot. The story is great, the characters are well developed, and Paul Rudd's Scott Lang is outstanding with his witty banter. This is one of my favorites in the MCU.

7279172,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,The movie by critics was a positive motivator to watch let alone own.  I own it now it is not a BIG blockbuster of a movie similar to other super hero movies or some other Marvels.  In my opinion it does stand on its own. It is a good Marvel movie to at least give a $1.00 rent to see. You may enjoy it enought to want to own it.,1463184000,,329,3.6857142857142855
7279173,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"If there is one recent release from Marvel I was interested to see on the big screen, it was the character Scott Lang as Ant-Man. And with an actor like Paul Rudd as Lang, I had a feeling this was going to be funny and fun - and it was! His supporting cast is amazing as well, with actors such as Michael Douglas as the original Ant-Man from the 60's, Hank Pym. Making this into a heist film with good intentions was a lot of fun, and fit the characters well. But even the fight scenes between Ant-Man and Yellowjacket were so expertly delivered, I watched this twice to take it all in. Not only will this movie entertain you with the planning that goes into the heist, but also make you laugh at the interaction that goes on throughout the film with Scott Lang's superhero education.

Great action and effects, of course, but a comic ""caper"" plotline and utterly charming characters too, all rendered with a tongue-in-cheek, hip tone so different from the typical superhero stuff. (I wish I had seen Deadpool so I could compare them, I'm sure this is a lot less irreverent but nonetheless light, breezy fun.)  Other than our hero's former prison-mates/housemates who at times were ethnic stereotypes (not particularly offensive, just a bit unsurprising and broadly played) it was so refreshing. Plus a very humorous encounter with an Avenger. I always strongly preferred DC comics to Marvel but Marvel's film (and increasingly TV) universe is coming together unbelievably well with something for everyone. Even people who don't like superhero movies or science fiction will find a lot to enjoy here.",1462924800,,962,5.166666666666667

Unlike several other Marvel movies, this one didn't even attempt to create a story to bridge the vast gap between fantasy and reality.  I'm not asking that they make me believe Ant Man could be real.  Obviously a viewer is already tossing that to the wind any time they watch a comic book movie.  But this one didn't even try.

7279307,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Out of all of Marvel's stable of superheroes, Ant-Man has to be one that I never was able to get into. Quite like DC's The Atom, the character just never seemed very interesting to me. Seriously, I thought ""What great adventures could you have with him?"". Then, I saw this film and I was simply amazed with what they were able to do with the character. Having seen every Marvel film(and adding them to my DVD collection), I have to-honestly- say this is their best film to date.

Ant-Man is about Dr. Hank Pym who is forced out of his own company by his protoge, Darren Cross. He recruits the talents of Scott Lang, a master thief just released from prison. Reluctantly, Lang becomes Ant-Man, trained by Pym and is armed with a suit that allows him to shrink in size, possess superhuman strength and control an army of ants. The miniature hero must use his new skills to prevent Cross from perfecting the same technology and using it as a weapon for the evil Hydra as Yellowjacket.

I'll be honest, the perk that made me check out this film, to begin with, is Yellowjacket. Any respectful Marvel fan will know that YJ is a hero in the comics but I seriously doubt Marvel will ever plan a Yellowjacket film after showing him as the antagonist in the film.

My only gripe is the fact that the villain isn't quite fleshed out enough. Sure, we see what he intends to accomplish in the film but I felt his character could have been more beefed up so as to be more of a threat for Ant-Man.

At any rate, Ant-Man has to be my most favorite film out of all the Marvel films so far...including Avengers: Age of Ultron. I highly recommend the film. It's fun, fast-paced and very entertaining.",1462492800,2,1682,4.433656957928803

This time, however, he plays a supporting role to Paul Rudd title character, Ant-man.  Ant-man, another of Marvel Comics submission to mainstream America, plays off Avengers, includes the ever present in Marvel Movies Stan Lee, and has Falcon/Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie).

This was a very weak movie.  I say this heavy heartedly.  I really LIKE Stan Lee's creations.  I have never before been let down by a Marvel Movie.  This was just painful to watch.",1461974400,,565,4.989247311827957

7279395,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"I'm a fan of most of the recent movies Marvel has brought to the silver screen.  I can't say Ant-Man is my favorite Marvel.  But I've watched it a number of times and each time I'm entertained by the action with the sprinkling of comedy.  So to include any spoilers, I'll simply say the story is a little slow at the beginning and maybe into the middle as the develop the characters, but has a good finish.  Turn toward the cast, I'd have to say I like some of Paul Rudd past works (not all).  Given his past roles, I just never really pictured him as the action/hero actor.  So I was pleasantly surprised at how he brought the character to life.  It was no surprise to me that I found veteran actor Michael Douglas' role in this film as Pym to be very entertaining; very good casting.",1461974400,3,785,4.263513513513513

I found them premise intriguing (shrinking), which seems to be something rarely dealt with in science fiction (I can think of maybe four movies about the subject over the last hundred years, though if there are more I would gladly admit my error).
Anyway, this was just a really fun bit of cinema and it seriously helped me relieve some stress- you know, one of those kinds of movies where every time the hero punches the bad dude you feel happier because you release endorphins or whatever.....the comic relief was just right- not forced, and it actually made me laugh/ snicker several times.",1461888000,2,700,4.745901639344262

Pym and Lang most save the world from a mad man that is use Ant-man's own tech to create an army of insect sized solders. fight scenes are really cool. the story of what happened to Wasp is a great father daughter moment. can't wait to see whats next.

The writing was terrible--it relied heavily on racist tropes and that's... really all there was, honestly. I didn't understand the motivation for most of the characters (apparently evil people are just magically evil for no reason? Or because Fake Daddy didn't love them enough?), the foreshadowing is suffocatingly in-your-face, the plot is completely predictable. I can honestly think of nothing good to say about this movie. :/",1461628800,,503,5.3

From the get go you are led to feel sympathy for Paul Rudd's character and understand his motivations for each decision he makes later on.  Much of the standard Marvel humor that has been since ""Iron Man"" seeps into this tale except it gives you a new perspective with a light hearted scenery in the fore front instead of the usual humor with the wit of ""Paul Rudd"" you are taken down the from redemption to a reconciliation that attaches you to the main character.  Each person in this movie makes the plot roll quick but with sympathy for their thoughts and actions.  A great change of pace to the Marvel Universe.",1461542400,,726,4.355555555555555

I waited a while to watch this and am really glad I did, it was well worth the wait and I love Corey Stoll as the heavy he dd a great job and should be ion every 3rd movie dude is great. Paul Rudd is great and playing it serious and then also being goofy to break the mood up. Great flick not just a super hero punching dudes in the face non stop, there's a real story and I am glad to see Marvel is trying new things with their films instead of sticking to the same save the world plot, however that's actually in here but anyway.... still a great movie and a must watch through the credits....both sets.",1461456000,2,956,4.117647058823529

It wasn't appreciably more silly than other superhero movies. It didn't drip with dreary ennui like Snyder's Superman torture experiments, though in juxtaposition anything even threatened to look like an edge was mechanically polished into bland non-existence (quite a feat of white-washing when the main character is a convicted felon, but the writers rose, or sank, aptly to the occasion). I never felt more than mildly bored (though I did feel I could break out the Kindle and browse the web at any point and not worry about missing a beat).

7279563,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Released in 2015, Ant-Man stars Paul Rudd as Scott Lang, a cat burglar who is offered redemption and the opportunity to be a hero. Michael Douglas plays his mentor, Hank Pym, and Evangeline Lilly Pyms daughter; Corey Stoll co-stars as the heavy. Also on hand are Judy Greer, Bobby Cannavale, Anthony Mackie and Michael Pea.

In my vast arsenal of old comics I have only one issue where Ant-Man is the main star: Marvel Feature #10, which featured Hank Pym as the hero, not to mention his wife, the Wasp, AKA Janet van Dyne. The characters run in that comic ceased with that very issue. By the 80s Scott Lang, a good-intentioned thief, became Ant-Man after stealing Pyms Ant-Man suit to save his daughter. With the encouragement of Pym, Lang became Ant-Man full-time.

The movie is based on these events and I was surprised at how entertaining it is considering how relatively unpopular the hero is. The movie even makes a joke about this when Ant-Man comes face-to-face with the Falcon (Mackie). Speaking of which, its great to see the Falcon in action. Its also great to see Yellowjacket who, in the comics, was Hank Pym after Lang took over as Ant-Man. In the movie Yellowjacket is the villain (Stoll), which is okay since Pyms Yellowjacket in the comics sort of became a villain when he had a mental breakdown and is eventually divorced by Janet, the Wasp. The filmmakers incidentally did an excellent job with the Yellowjacket suit.

Ant-Man was a surprise hit at the box office and understandably so. Its a quality superhero flick done with style and brimming with confidence. Its nothing more than this, but thats all it needs to be. Its nice to see Michael Douglas who was, believe-it-or-not, 70 years-old during shooting. He shines in the movie as Pym and could easily pass for ten years younger. I also really liked the Quantum Realm sequence when Lang is reduced to microscopic size.

The film runs 117 minutes and was shot in Georgia and San Francisco, CA.

7279589,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Ant Man would have easily got 5  stars, but there are some plot holes large enough to drive a giant Thomas toy through. I understand it is just a super hero movie, but at the beginning of the film, Hank Pym explains that his serum powered suit works by reducing the space between molecules, not reducing the number of molecules, so Ant Man packs a full sized human punch even when small! When that is convenient, he has a mass of a 200 lb human, but that mass would crush a normal sized ant. So when it is convenient, Scott Lang only has the mass that would match a tiny human. Granted, my knowledge of the details of Hank's serum/gizmo are smaller than a keychain tank charm, but I don't remember Marvel having a clear explanation in the source material either. My knowledge of the details of the MCU ended around college, which was a long time ago... 'nuff said.",1461024000,,864,4.4

He does the best he can with a fairly interesting movie, that mainly suffers from relying on CGI. It's unavoidable due to the story of the character, but as with most excessive CGI, it just pulls the viewer out of the story if it goes on too long. The long fights are where this movie loses it's luster. I will continue to believe that had the Wright-Pegg combo worked out, this movie would of been better. As an example, ""Scott Pilgrim Saves The World"" uses a lot of CGI, but it doesn't detract from the story.",1461024000,,603,4.252173913043478

7279699,3,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Let me start out by saying, a three star on this film in no way reflects an opinion that says ""I could care less whether this film existed or not"", because I am glad that they made it. No, there are basically three reasons why I give this film a three star, and the first one is more simple than the second, and the third is based on moral issues.

1) It is an origin story:
Okay, so I am NOT holding anything against this movie for being an origin story, I am glad that it is an origin story. The thing with origin stories though - and I almost always agree with this approach - is their focus on training. Seldom can you have a good super hero without them learning about their abilities, but it often tends to be somewhat boring, holding out on all the good stuff until the sequel.

2) Too much dependence on the MCU:
So yes, I am on in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and I am glad that this film is a part of it. When I say that it is too dependent, I'm not saying that it shouldn't be a part of it (Minor SPOILER ahead). Although I keep up with the MCU, one of my first thoughts was, this being an origin film and all, it should be able to stand alone. Ant Man hasn't been properly introduced into the MCU yet, so this film, although part of the MCU, shouldn't act like he has. When you go to see this film, you shouldn't have to know the full MCU to get what is going on, because Ant Man hasn't been fully brought into the Universe yet. Unfortunately, when Ant Man runs into an Avenger named Falcon, that is exactly what it fails to do. It acts like you should be 100% familiar with Falcon already, and uses that to fuel the whole scene. Now, I'm not saying that Falcon shouldn't have been a part of this film at all, in fact, it might have been a great opportunity to bring Ant Man into the MCU before Captain America 3: Civil War, but unfortunately, like I said it relies too much on the knowledge of the MCU, that somebody who I watching Ant Man just because they want to, and is not familiar with the rest of the Extended Universe, won't know what on Earth is going on, and that's just sad.

3) Language:
To me, this is one of the most unfortunate things of the film. So maybe some films I've watched before have language in them, and the second Maze Runner has more then this one, but my big problem here is not only the language, but the use of the language. While in films like the Maze Runner, the language causes a horrid cringe, it's over just like that; The context that language is used in this film causes it to stand out more, and it does fade as quickly causing it to be much more awful. In a preview for the film, they have a certain line that is perfectly fine to watch, and even somewhat funny, but in the movie, that line is swapped out with a much more awful word, and it just makes me cringe. Another time the same word is used, and in a context that stands out again, and that makes me cringe. Oh well, what can you expect from a movie where the main character is SCOTT LANG(auge).

 But regardless of all this, the film has quite a few positive points, from a superhero who can shrink (great idea Marvel) to Thomas the Tank Engine causing mass mayhem. So yes, I think three stars is a decent rating for this film, and can probably expect Ant Man and Wasp to reach at least a four star, if not five, because the first two points will have a very hard time making it into that film.

7279706,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"I grew up with comics, I know who Ant-Man is (both of them) but I was still surprised when I heard they were making this movie. ""Surely there are other characters more deserving of films"".

I still agree with that sentiment but they went and gave Ant-Man a movie and it's actually pretty good.  It's Ant-Man so don't go in expecting a cinematic masterpiece, if you want a fun, light hearted super hero heist flick I can't think of a better choice.",1460419200,2,447,4.439024390243903

BUT IT WAS AWESOME!

Ant-Man is a funny, well written movie with phenomenal acting. Paul Rudd does a great job making us care about his character Scott Lang.
Scott isn't doing something just because he is a perfect guy who wants to do the right thing Like Captain America or Superman. He's not fighting due to some personal tragedy like Daredevil or Batman He becomes a hero because he is trying to become a better person for his daughter and he is trying to make the world better for her. Everything he does he does for her.
And he does a good job at it.
He even goes one on one with one of the Avengers and doesn't die, so go Scott.",1460246400,2,809,4.212903225806452

7279744,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"The first half of this movie isn't that good. It's kind of boring, kind of silly,  and isn't like any of the other Marvel movies which are very well written and have a lot of great action. However, the second half of this movie is a lot better because there is a lot of action, great special effects, and a real bad guy that makes the movie interesting. It's just too bad that the first half of this movie didn't match up to the second half of this movie. But, overall I recommend this movie because the second half of this movie is very entertaining. I'm actually really looking forward now to Ant Man 2. I hope that they will have the same actor for Ant Man.

An ex-con who's soul purpose is to convince his daughter that he really is a good guy...and his ex hates him and wants nothing to do with him (except, of course, show his daughter that he really is a good guy)...how many times have we endured that story already? Liar Liar anyone?? At least with that movie you were supposed to laugh...unfortunately Ant-man just makes you want to cry...and often. Oh...mind controlling ants?? Really?? Who thinks this is entertains?? Shame on you if you do. DC is making real superhero movies...but Marvel is turning everyone's brains to mush that no one can appreciate true creativity and inspiration. 12 cookie cutter movies and counting...how much more redundancy can we handle?

7279890,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"It was a good action typical Marvel movie. Some parts of the movie I feel show have been explained more, like it just briefly hit it and moved on. Antman of course was not a real good guy like the Captain, or very rich like Tony, or had super powers like Thor. He was just a common crook who seem to never want to play by the rules, although that changes, it was nice to show that it doesn't matter where you come from, you can still do great things. But truthfully, I would let any child under 13 see this. Not just based on the rating they gave it, but my personal beliefs found it to not really be the most appropriate for a Christian home with a small child, until they are at the age where they understand right from wrong. But it of course is just up to the parental viewer. No, it's not an awfully inappropriate movie, definitely compared to Deadpool, but just be aware that that it is not a 100% clean film. Still a good watch though.",1458691200,,942,4.1530054644808745

7279897,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"My whole family enjoyed this movie. Nearly all of the major characters are all funny. With some the humor is blatant and even outrageous - the main character and his buddies are really goofy - and with others the humor is more subtle. There is plenty of action, as you would expect with a superhero movie, but even the climactic battle scene alternates between thrills and giggles.

The decision to have the hero be a new character (Scott Lang) rather than Dr. Hank Pym was a good one. It allowed the filmmakers to ditch the baggage associated with some of Hank Pym's darker actions in the original comics. It also allowed the filmmakers to bring Ant-Man into the present without making a new Hank Pym origin story set in the modern era (it's a continuation, not a ""reboot"" of the series). In this movie, Hank Pym is an old man. He is still brilliant, but physically he is no longer able to stand up to the rigors of being the Ant-Man, and needs someone younger to help him prevent an ambitious scientist from unleashing the potentially dangerous Ant-Mantechnology into dangerous hands.

SPOILER ALERT!

Most of the themes of the movie are pretty wholesome. The main character is a father trying to get his life back together after being released from prison. Even though he did commit a crime, he did so with good intentions. He broke the law exposing criminal fraud by others and returning fraudulently obtained funds. He does struggle with morality and makes some bad choices after leaving prison, since he is desperate to pay his back child support so that he can get visitation rights with his daughter, yet he has trouble holding down a job since no one wants to hire a felon. However, it is his talent for burglary that lands him in his new gig as Ant-Man. In the end his morality and his love for his daughter are the qualities that allow him to make the tough decision needed to save the day.

The special effects are very good, and the filmmakers took a lot of care to make the environment realistic in the scenes where Ant-Man is the size of an ant. Their attention to detail really shows.

I bet a lot of kids begged their kids for ant farms after seeing this movie!",1458604800,,2178,4.545918367346939
7279898,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Marvel continues to produce fun, action-filled ""comic book"" fantasy for the screen.  Not a blockbuster, but definitely a good time from start to finish.",1458604800,,152,5.333333333333333
7279899,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"I'm sorry...sometimes size does count.  Even in the world of superheroes where everything is by virtue of the genre fantastic, I just couldn't get excited about the story of someone reduced to ant size to fight injustice. I mean...one false step and no more fighter.

Nevertheless...

In spite of the negative feelings I had about this movie, simply from the previews, I decided to give it a chance and to watch it anyway, and found it entertaining and amusing.  The story is the usual plot of theft and revenge but the CGI effects are great and the ants are fantastic, especially Anthony.  There's some of the same smart-quip humor as in Deadpool though the entire story is fairly low-key when compared to that film. It's well-acted, well-written, and I enjoyed it.",1458604800,,766,4.816793893129771

7279950,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"A pretty decent introduction to Ant Man's powerset and the cinematic version of the character. I enjoyed the change of pace from the other MCU movies with  heist-film vibe especially.  It's almost a shame that they didn't take full advantage of the genre and reveal that Hope was actually running another mission as the Wasp as well, but at least there's an indication that they're working a future for her character.
I'd also forgotten just what a good comedic actor Michael Douglas is, his isn't a comedic character but when he's part of a gag, his timing and delivery is perfect.",1458000000,,582,4.752475247524752

7279952,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Just outstanding. Might be the best Marvel movie yet. As impressive as the special effects were, it's the degree of imagination that went into this movie that makes it so good. Just about all the other Marvel movies are alluded to, and with good effect. You can tell there are big plans for this character in future movies. We'll worth seeing.",1458000000,,343,4.639344262295082

7279955,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Ant-man was a great origin story. It got right to the point but still managed to provide enough history to understand how the Ant-man came to be. What I especially love about Paul Rudy's character is that he was just a regular guy. In fact, he wasn't even a particularly good guy, but he was the ""right"" guy. Which peaks my interest to how he'll stand up against other avengers in Civil War. I gave Ant-man 5 stars because I E joy ed the movie the entire time and never felt bored watching it. It kept my interest the entire time.",1458000000,,530,4.257425742574258

7279958,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"I really need to get it into my head that I shouldn't doubt Marvel Studios. Every time they release a superhero film based on a character that is a little off the beaten track, I think it will be a flop...and, every time, they prove me wrong. I guess I should know better by now, though. I thought Iron Man was a little too obscure for the mass audience, yet that kickstarted the entire modern Marvel era. Thor, Guardians of the Galaxy...time after time, Marvel just reinforces the fact that they know what they're doing.

Ant-Man is offbeat, funny, and linked directly to the Avengers universe. Like Guardians of the Galaxy, it is a film that proves you can still make a good superhero movie without getting dark and grim about it. (Heads-up, DC...you could learn a thing or two.)

In short...you won't be disappointed.",1458000000,,820,4.6482758620689655
7279959,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"This is not the best of the Avengers, but still a great flick. Paul Rudd, as usual, kills it! Michael Douglas was great! And that CGI! My only qualm was more IT related. For some reason it stopped and cutoff half way through the film for no reason.",1458000000,,248,4.1875

It has a pretty nice slipcover where the word ""ANT-MAN"" and ""Scott Lang picture"" are embossed. It also has a cool  black-colored case for the 2 discs (Blu-Ray and 3D).

Marvel invested too much in the supporting characters ""humor"", and i barely cracked a smile. They came off more annoying than amusing to me.

7280054,1,B00ZGDIGZ2,I will say the tie in with other superheroes saves the end a bit. I don't blame the actors. They played the parts well. It's a movie built on ceremony. I hope the sequel is better. Best way to explain it I know is this. It's like the Yankees on a year they don't win the right players in the wrong roles. Every move an error. It is the baseball pun of movies. I'm sure there is some guy that likes it.,1457308800,23,401,3.902439024390244

When I woke up I wasn't going to give it a 2nd chance but I did anyway. This time I was able to stay awake. The 2nd time watching it was better than the 1st. I wasn't as bored but the movie felt like it dragged on & on & on. 1 of the best things about Ant-Man were the scenes with Abby Ryder Fortson & Paul Rudd (I could watch those over & over again) Also the special effects were just awesome. I loved how things that were small were made BIG & things that were BIG were made small. The fight between Ant-Man & Yellowjacket was my favorite part of the movie. I won't even go into it. You just have to see it for yourself. Even though the only thing I truly enjoyed about Ant-Man were the special effects, if there is a sequel, I'd give it a watch.

7280157,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"In the Marvel Universe all superheroes have one thing in common: Their lives are, to put it mildly, complicated.
That's certainly true for Scott Lang. He's smart but he does dumb things (like drive a billionaire's Bentley into a swimming pool.) He's a dad but since he's been in prison for a few years he doesn't really know his daughter very well, although he wants to now be a part of her life. His ex-wife doesn't really think that's such a good idea, however, since he's an ex-con and she's now married to a cop. She tells him flat out that she doesn't want him to be around their daughter until he proves that he's now a responsible adult and by that she means he has to get a job and pay child support.
Oh, and he's been subtly recruited by a legendary scientist to become the superhero Ant-Man and save the world.
""Ant-Man"" is another winner from Marvel though it is a little lighter in touch than most of the previous films the studio has brought to the big screen. There is, for example, more humor in this movie than in most Marvel productions; something that is likely attributable to the fact that Paul Rudd co-wrote the script in addition to starring as Lang. Rudd is a veteran comedian and has appeared in numerous comedies in both television and the movies.
The special effects are well above average and the cast - which features Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, and Michael Pena - is top notch. Pena is especially notable as Lang's excitable friend and fellow ex-con Luis because the role is so unlike those he played in the World War II drama ""Fury"" and the Fifties-era cop film ""Gangster Squad.""
The verdict: A very entertaining film that's well worth watching.",1456790400,,1682,4.591362126245847

7280192,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Refreshingly done sci fi film. This would appeal to anyone for it is neat and complete and ""tight"" in all areas. A true joy to watch, even thought it is also suitable to children. The level of comedy is intelligent and spot on with perfect timing. Even with the CGI ants etc., you never get distracted by ""tongue in cheek"" moments as many other movies of this genre have.

Michael Caine and Paul Rudd played their parts perfectly. Evangeline Lilly was an unexpected pleasure in acting. Here expressions and delivery were a rare treat; different and refreshing among all the usual stereo types and forced characters.

Adventure, action and tightly directed perfectly filmed scenes and acting make a movie that is so well done that you forget the work that goes into things as good as this. It is just totally enjoyable.",1456617600,,818,4.753521126760563

Special effects are great and human relationships are solid. I backed this up almost immediately. I will definitely watch this more than once.

7280285,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"""Ant-man"", like ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", is a marvelous one-off Marvel superhero movie.  The leading characters are likable and their problems are human-scale, except for the whole superhero thing.  Scott Lang is a down-on-his-luck former electrical engineer, just out of prison for a high-tech burglary, unable to get a job, and barred from seeing his young daughter. He draws the attention of Dr. Hank Pym, the somewhat legendary original Ant-man, who has chosen to hide the secret of miniaturization.  When it becomes clear that an untrustworthy former protg is on the verge of rediscovering Pym's formula, Pym will have to persuade a reluctant Lang to take on the role of Ant-man.  The stage is set for an incredibly dangerous heist, one that Lang will need his former burglary crew to pull off.

Paul Rudd is a very believable Scott Lang, someone easy to root for.  Michael Douglas is excellent as Dr. Pym, a man with a guilty secret or two.  Evangeline Lilly is perfect as his estranged daughter, who thinks Lang isn't up to the task of pulling off the heist.  The supporting cast is solid, including a cameo by one of the Avengers.  The special effects are decent without overwhelming the storyline, and Lang's former crew more than pulls their weight in the drama and humor departments.  Highly recommended as good entertainment.",1455840000,,1339,4.9641255605381165

A few deus ex machina scenes (as in events are ""suddenly"" explained out of nowhere) snap you out of the movie. It overreaches when going for the sentimental scenes (father-daughter relationships) and comic relief. Special effects are good and not too jarring during actions scenes like most super-hero films.

7280401,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Ant-Man/Henry Pym was one of my early years' favorite Marvel heroes, and they've done a wonderful job of moving the Ant-Man story from an earlier generation to today - showing Michael Douglas, as a retired Pym, handing-off the Ant-Man job to a highly unlikely successor. (Paul Rudd as Scott Lang) This is also the most humorous Marvel movie made to date - lots of fun camera work and dialogue kept my family laughing, even though the plot is serious. All major actors are terrific, especially Michael Pena (also great in The Martian) as Luis, and Evangeline Lilly as Pym's daughter Hope.",1455494400,,587,4.821782178217822

7280403,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,Pleasantly surprised by this movie.  The father-daughter relationships x2  made it appealing. There was a tense moment when the villain zapped a little lamb and turned it into matter but thank goodness it's only make believe and there was no blood and gore. Very tastefully done. Different from the usual marvel action movies.,1455494400,,326,5.132075471698113

This is a fun story, so different than the usual non stop action in the other Super Hero movies. We loved that Michael Douglas is in the show, he is awesome as always. Paul Rudd plays Ant-Man and does a fabulous job. Very entertaining, and we have recommended that all our friends watch this one!",1455408000,,466,4.306818181818182

The Ant-Man is a likeable Superhero and funny at times.
If you don't like him because he is talking to ants why did you get it in the first place. Title says it all.
The movie was funny with action and acting was great. 3D effects are awesome especially the last 30 minutes.
Definitely worth buying, renting or collecting.",1455321600,,435,4.253012048192771

The stakes weren't as all-encompassing as they were in Ultron, which made Ant-Man feel more intimate. The hero is suitably likable, the ants even show personality, and the ""train derailment"" scene just made me laugh out loud!",1455321600,,377,4.641791044776119

7280506,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"When I saw the preview for Ant-Man, my initial thought was, Why?.  It just looked sosilly.  Ant-Man, to me, looked like a story that was better suited for the CW, a story that could be better told as a teen-centered television series or, possibly more accurately, as a kids Saturday Morning Cartoon.  So, I avoided it.  Some bloggers saw it and loved it or at least really liked it and yet I couldn't bring myself to care enough to shell out the money to see it on the big screen.

But I have kids and to them this looked amazing and we found ourselves snuggled in the bed (well, they were in the bed with my wife while I saton the floor) watching this as a family.

It was pretty cool.

Color me surprised that all the silly aspects of this film actually work themselves into the fabric in such a way that it never feels hokey.  Marvel has always had a sense of humor that is often worked into their films, not always for the better, and so its expected that this is going to have some sort of sarcastic bite, but here it actually works.  This is due in large part to the fact that Paul Rudd sells his character and this premise with an effortlessness that defies genre.  Hes just such a natural performer.  He makes this all seem remotely believable because of that.  In fact, the entire cast mostly works here.  Stoll is a little over the top, but Pena, Douglas and Lilly anchor the film well, and Mackies cameo moment is priceless.

I think a lot of my enjoyment comes from the fact that I am not familiar with the superhero.  I never got into Ant-Man as a kid and so other than knowing he existed, I didn't know anything about him.  This adaptation is not the original story, as my daughter pointed out.  Apparently she read a book on Ant-Mango figureand so she made me aware a few minutes in that Scott Lang is NOT Ant-Man.  I don't care, really, but any Ant-Man enthusiasts (are there any Ant-Man enthusiasts?) might take issue with this.

You know what you won't take issue with?  A giant Thomas Train busting through a house and an oversized ant chasing police and that whole bedroom battle at the films closing because its pretty epic and clever and just a whole lot of awesome!  The effects here (visual and aural) are really top notch and go a long way to making Ant-Man feel like a legit superhero movie and not some sort of parody.

Its funny, charming, cute and exciting when it counts, and that all counts for something.

That being said, I don't feel like I missed anything waiting to see this on the small-screen.",1454803200,,2531,4.384120171673819

7280508,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,This is a good Movie for my 9 year old boy!,1454803200,,43,3.0
7280509,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,This movie was pretty funny. I do think the climax could have been better. Paul Rudd does a wonderful acting job and the support cast is great. I can't wait to see Rudd in Captain America Civil War.,1454803200,,198,4.2368421052631575
7280510,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"It is a fine movie, fits into the Marvel universe, just not as compelling as the other stories they have put out there.",1454803200,,119,4.217391304347826
7280511,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"The Good:

From beginning to end, the humor and comedic element probably stands out the most for this movie. There were constant chuckle worthy moments, and a few laugh out loud moments that make this movie ""Funny"" but not ""Hysterical"". Best of all, none of the humor seemed forced in any way, and all seemed to just flow seamlessly throughout the film. Unlike in the comics, there's an an interesting twist with Michael Douglas's character, Hank Pym, that fits well with Marvel's other properties.  It's also easy to relate to Paul Rudd's character (Scott Lang/Ant-Man) due to his wit and charisma. It's probably fair to say that Michael Pea comes very close to stealing the show with all of his funny scenes. The action scenes were nicely done and there is a surprise scene that I cannot describe without spoiling it, but it was a nice addition for the sake of continuity based off of Marvel's previous film. (Update: Marvel has ruined the surprise. Click Here if you don't mind the spoiler.) A final interesting tidbit is the CGI that's used in the film is remarkable. If you can't notice or tell what I'm talking about when you watch the film, then that's a testament to how good the CGI was implemented.

The Bad:

Majority of the film is very predictable and done in a pretty standard cookie cutter fashion. They drop so many obvious hints and foreshadowing that the main plot is pretty much laid out before it plays out. While Paul Rudd does a good job overall, this role is not much a stretch for him. If you're not a fan of Rudd's previous performances or his comedic style (This is 40, Knocked Up) then you may be disappointed yet again. The 3D element was a fail. There were some good opportunities to really make the 3D effects stand out, but you can't help but get the feeling that Marvel simply didn't want to put any more money into special effect in those scenes. Maybe it's just me, but I was a bit taken back at the amount of cursing that was in the film. There were a lot of ""S"" bombs dropped and it just didn't seem like Marvel/Disney's style with such a potential kid-friendly superhero character.

The Reason:

The main question many of you will have is ""Was this better than Avengers Age of Ultron""? To that, I will say...wrong comparison. Avengers Age of Ultron was a different type of movie; it was a ""superhero movie"" with super heroes starring in it. Ant-Man is a ""heist movie"" that just so happens to star a super hero in it. This is similar to Captain America 2: Winter Soldier being a ""spy conspiracy movie"" that happened to star a super hero. So it's difficult to compare the two films head to head. The closest comparison would be to Guardians of the Galaxy because, along with Ant-Man, it was a film about some relatively unknown characters. I'd say this movie can be considered a success primarily due to making an unknown character interesting enough that they can become fan favorites in futures movies. To sum up the overall impression of this film, I'd say it's funny, entertaining, good, but not epic. It's well worth the watch in theaters, and even on DVD or download when it becomes available. Oh and don't forget, there are two end-credit scenes. One is in the middle of the credits, and the other is all the way after the credits.

The Rating: 8/10

The Ant-Man name seemed to have more cachet in the late 60's when I first started reading Marvel comics. Today it is a name ripe for ridicule and the Ant-Man could have ended up a ridiculous movie if it had taken itself too seriously. The movie deals with the name by making it a product of times gone by when Hank Pym, the original Ant-Man, was in his prime. The requisite costume and the name are handed down to Scott Lang, who shares the audience's opinion of the name. As the movie progresses, Scott earns respect from the audience for both the character and the name. The movie never takes itself too seriously and injects fun into just about every scene. The thomas the tank engine battle is a hoot. This movie is great for a night of light entertainment with the kids and a bowl of popcorn or even just the bowl of popcorn.",1454544000,,920,4.385964912280702

My wife was not a fan of Guardians (too many aliens, not able to connect to those characters), but she really liked Ant Man. Good Marvel technology, action, and characters.

7280723,2,B00ZGDIGZ2,"As disappointing as it was to see Edgar Wright robbed of his chance to leave his stylistic mark on the superhero genre before it finally implodes, I can easily remove that detail from the equation and still come away feeling like the Marvel formula finally hit the wall and slid lazily to the floor with this one. While not unwatchable, it does get as close to it as I've seen from the House of increasingly recycled Ideas, serving to be one of the least engaging and polished Marvel productions since 'Thor: The Dark World'. Paul Rudd, a likeable actor when given the Apatow license-to-riff, is suffocated by his milquetoast watering down of the Irredeemable Scott Lang, a character with the irreverent potential of a Starlord or Tony Stark but confusingly excused of any negative qualities that could have made him interesting. The one slight glimmer of charm is Micheal Douglas, nice to see back in time-tested form as a considerably more interesting Hank Pym, not fully utilized but not entirely wasted either (for wasted, see Judy Greer as 'exposition mom'). Capping things off however is Evangeline Lilly, whose Hope Pym is possibly the worst character I'd seen written in 2015; shrill, bipolar, and on call to provide one of the least believable and forced 'i-hate-you-now-I-love-you' romances I've had to endure. There's moments of creativity with the shrinking/growing gimmick central to the film, but outside of nips I imagine were taken from Wright's original screenplay, the action feels like manufactured whimsy, the ultimate climax reminiscent of 'Dark World's special effects jibberish ending. Conceptually, some neat ideas that would have been better served by an artist's hand, but you can feel the glove tightening over at Marvel Studios, polishing a line of products planned with meticulous blandness out to the end of the current decade. The fun couldn't last forever, and unless Gunn was given a free pass to keep doing what he was doing with the next 'Guardians', this could be the real harbinger of things to come for Marvel and indeed the remaining days of the Age of Superhero Movies.",1454112000,,2109,5.0285714285714285

Still, it is close to 5 stars than 4. The acting is very good, the special effects are state of the art and the characters are  very close the their comic book origins. It is not slow nor does it feel like too much was crammed into a single film. It is just right. IT has a good blend of laughs and fun with mayhem and seriousness.

Honestly, the Film didn't live up to my wildest dreams but Hey...Marvel is making a killing on these films first of all. I just didn't connect with most of the characters aside from a few funny moments overshadowed by somewhat dull and drawn out scenes. I guess you have to set up the movie and explain back stories to those unfamiliar with the subject matter. The last 15-20 minutes of the Film were great, Truly what I wanted out of the entire film.

No. The plot is a little jumpy and at times hard to believe (though we are talking superheroes...), but I think most will say it's a fun film to watch with a new spin on your traditional hero story. It's not quite as fast-talking as Iron Man, nor is it as dramatic and ""character-driven""?. But it's funny and Paul Rudd is a great choice to take the lead. Michael Pena is one of my favorite actors and he really does a lot with a little here. Overall pleasant surprise and fun movie.",1453766400,,541,4.262135922330097

7280844,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Surprisingly funny and entertaining Marvel hero. I had low expectations for this initially and was pleasantly surprised at the story, the acting and the special effects (which are really remarkable). Paul Rudd does a great job in the title role, and it was refreshing to see a hero Dad who actually values his responsibility to love and care for his daughters (Dad's seem to generally get a bad rap in cinema so this was an appreciated feature of the film.) The effects were fantastic and convincing... you really feel like you're in that tub when Ant-Man makes his initial transformation. Michael Douglas is fantastic in the supporting role (spoiler alert: I was a little surprised he survived the film. He seemed like he was being setup as the 'old guy who gives away the secrets then tragically dies' formula, but that didn't actually happen.  Evangeline Lilly was alright in the supporting role, but did they deliberately do her hair to look like that of Catherine Zeta-Jones? That was oddly distracting to me.
The Avengers tie-in, as well as references to the larger Marvel universe, was appreciated. I'm glad to see Marvel studios continue this style of maintaining characters within the same narrative, and hope we get to see Ant-Man with the Avengers at some point. Biggest negative would be the three burglary accomplices, mostly there as ""comic"" relief (ala 'Darcy' in the Thor films) and these guys really don't work. They aren't really funny and they just seem extraneous to the story.
Ant-Man was advertised on the box as ""for the whole family"", and that's mostly the case. There was a fair amount of profanity, a couple coarse jokes, and a couple scenes with giant ants that might be scary for younger viewers, but otherwise it's a decent, entertaining super hero film.",1453593600,,1783,4.903973509933775

7280881,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"I was going into this film expecting it to be decent because of the over saturation of superhero films by I was surprised. I'm not even sure what genre this film is in. Yeah it involves a superhero yeah it has a heist but it's not just a heist movie or a superhero movie. It has so many elements of various things like social commentary on why nonviolent offenders turn to crime after being released, domestic tragedy of custody disputes, talks of advanced technology, VERY creative and goods effects, absurdly good humor that, of all things, makes product placement hilarious, superb acting, characters written with so much charm, whit likability and humanity they'll fit right in with the rest of the Avengers and action that mixes laughs with epicness. This film is absurdly good, possibly the next Iron Man, and is a must see for this year. Maybe one of the best films Marvel has released and takes the cake as far as setting up a wish to see more from this franchise and these characters.

Ant-Man, more tongue-in-cheek than most of the MCU so far, is beautifully paced and cleverly presented, with a great cast and a great tease for a continuation of the story of these particular heroes.",1453507200,,264,4.739130434782608
7280901,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"After an ok film in Avengers: Age of Ultron, I don't think anyone was ready to hear ""WAIT!, we have one more film!""

When I heard that Ant-Man was going to be a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, knowing the success of 'Guardians of the Galaxy', I felt that this would be one of the biggest surprises. Also, when I heard that Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish penned the screenplay I was even more excited for the film. You know what, this was such a fun film!

The more trailers I watched for Ant-Man the more excited that I got. Knowing that actors like Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas were going to be joining the MCU my hopes got higher. Now, this film is far from perfect. However, the characters and the story and the pace of the film are what sell this film and give Ant-Man his rightful place among the big guns like Iron Man and Captain America. For a character that has the power to shrink and control insects, no one would look at a character like this relevant. This film, makes him relevant. Adding additional pieces to the story like Hank Pym's past and a few additional surprises into the mix and topping it all with a heist which is a Marvel first was just fun and fun to watch! The one weakness of this film was probably Corey Stoll as Yellow Jacket. I just didn't find him as intimidating as other villains we have seen so far but, there are been many villains already introduced that were the same way. (Ultron)

When this movie comes to a close you are just craving more fun and it looks like Ant-Man is going to bring that element full force in future films and because of the success of the Ant-Man solo film we will be getting a sequel and I am very excited to see it. Now we are entering Wave 3 of the MCU and after the great work with Ant-Man I am hoping that wave 3 will bring the MCU back to form.

Micheal Douglas is great, Paul Rudd, surprise did the screenplay and was an excellent ""Ant Man"". Evangeline Lilly plays Michael Douglas' daughter. I don't want to give away any of the story, but she makes you believe that they really don't get along. Corey Stoll you really want him to get his just desserts!
And of course the Stan Lee cameo, I love that he has been able to do that in all the Marvel movies.
You have to remember this is a Marvel comic made into a movie.  So a very little things can be powerful. How many of you are afraid of bees? or Fire ants?
The special effects took you right into the ant world. What it would be like if all of a sudden you were their size.  Who is afraid of rain? to and ant. The technology is explained believeably. Great comic relief. It is a definite keeper.",1453334400,7,939,4.194444444444445

My wife really enjoys it as well because it.....well....has a story with it.

There's also that other movie featuring a bunch of Hobbits going to battle.  But, really, when was the last time you cheered and laughed at a movie that left you feeling energetic after the credits began to roll?  Been awhile...right?  Well, have I got a Blu-ray to recommend...

ANT-MAN could be easily overlooked -- not just for the size of this Marvel Super Hero, but among the mass of other similar  titles that have been churned out over the past few years.  However, make no mistake about it, this is one of Marvel's best efforts to date.  Additionally, though not the best 3D release, it is one of the most immersive and enjoyable films I have recently seen in that format. Ready?  Let's get started...

By all rights, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) should be leading a successful life.  However, with a masters of Electrical Engineering in hand, he has reduced been to a petty thief, finding himself in and out of jail.  Scott yearns to change his life around, and as a precondition set by his ex-wife (Judy Greer), if he gets himself a steady job and stays out of trouble, he will be allowed to reconnect with his daughter, Cassie.  Easier said than done.  In order to earn a little extra cash, Lang agrees to do one last heist  and breaks into the home of Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), where he finds a remarkable piece of hidden research that is about to change his life.

By keeping vague on the particulars of this story, I am not going to ruin any of the twists that are in store for viewers.  I am only going to say that the filmmakers have taken a very small character and truly elevated it to Super Hero status thanks to the film's blending of action, humor and terrific sci-fi effects.  More importantly, this one of the more 'human"" stories in the Marvel Character Universe, thanks in part to its expert casting.  Both Rudd and Douglas deliver memorable performances as flawed personalities looking for some sort of redemption.  I particularly enjoyed watching Michael Douglas take on the role of a father figure who becomes a mentor to Paul Rudd's character and brings some heart-tugging scenes to the film as he attempts to protect his formula and daughter from the clutches of an evil former associate, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll).

The mere fact that an actor like Michael Douglas would agree to be part of this film speaks volumes about how popular these Marvel Comic films have become.  And really, this is equally as much a Douglas effort as it is Ruud.  In fact, I would go as far as saying that this is one of the best Michael Douglas films I have seen, and it is his performance that gives ANT-MAN its stability.

Assigning an overall rating to the 3D presentation was a little difficult.  This is an effort unconverted in post production. As I pointed out at the top of my review, ANT-MAN is not the best 3D title you can buy.  I usually rate pop-out effects very high, and this film has just about none.  However, for those that enjoy an immersive experience, this is one of the absolute best of that league, which is why I gave ANT-MAN the best overall score.  The filmmakers have presented a playing field that is infinite in scope.  Depth is the most important factor in this presentation and every scene has a limitless feel to it. This is very important in emphasizing Ant-Man's shrunken size against the larger world that surrounds him.  Take, for instance, our hero being shrunken inside a bathtub, which extends itself seemingly endlessly within frame.  As turbulent water is introduced, depth provides perfect scale and distance, immersing the viewer to the point that he/she feels shrunken themselves.  This a level of engrossment that I don't often encounter in this format, and I was very surprised that, combined with remarkable cinematography and CGI work, ANT-MAN provides an absorbing, heart-pounding 3D experience that cannot be duplicated in 2D.

Crosstalk was mostly absent.  The only time I sensed any presence of ghosting was on the disc menu overlay as I pressed the PLAY button.  Other than that, there was none to be seen.

The overall image presentation is flawless, as to be expected.  Fine detail is remarkable throughout the live action and effect sequences.  This high definition transfer delivers exceptional laboratory whites, warm containment room blues, and the rich, warm colors of Dr. Prym's study.  This is a bright, robust, sharply detailed offering with strong black levels and absolutely no anomalies.

ANT-MAN features an equally astounding 7.1 DTS-HDMA mix that elevates the level of immersion to new heights.  The fronts, surrounds and subwoofer unite to place the viewer smack-dab in the middle most bizarre sonic situations. Ever been inside a vacuum? How about locked within a briefcase thrown from a helicopter, as it hurdles towards earth?  All of these effects are perfectly executed with astounding presence and flying cross-channel pans.  From a tidal-wave of bathtub water to the deep growls of a.....mouse....all of the effects are well pronounced.  The high-octane action sequences are perfectly balanced so that they don't drown out the dialogue.  In all, this mix is about as good as it gets.

ANT-MAN arrives in a 2-disc package that includes separate 3D and 2D Blu-ray releases as well as Digital HD.  Extras include Deleted and Extended scenes, Audio Commentary by director Peyton Reed and actor Paul Rudd.  There are also the standard ""making of"" features that look into the making of the film.

On paper, ANT-MAN could have looked like a complete dud.  However, on screen, the movie seamlessly combines action and comedy in producing the most surprisingly enjoyable action-hero film since Guardians of the Galaxy.  I was particularly deeply moved by Micheal Douglas's performance.  He owns this film!

As a 3D presentation, ANT-MAN is demo material.  The visual artists team have taken the Honey I Shrunk The Kids approach, elevating it to today's special-effects standards.  The result is a viewing experience filled with infinite depth that brings its miniature world to life.  It's rather amazing that such a tiny Super Hero provides for immense, immersive entertainment.  It's worth a blind purchase and the perfect, fun watch for the entire family.",1453075200,,6379,4.880930232558139

Marvel continues to bring us heroes big and small, well known and obscure, and this was no exception. I've never read Ant-Man trades, but it got me interested in wanting to start to, which is a part of their agenda. They've excelled at making these movies to satisfy most fans as well as bring in new fans and give them enough material to make them a bit curious about the movie's source material. That said, I can't wait to see how they place Ant-Man in future installments. You definitely want to add this to your Marvel shelf!",1452816000,,801,4.418918918918919

He especially likes the end of the movie and still giggles uncontrollably, even after multiple viewings :) I am not, by any means, a Marvel aficionado, so I can't speak for the accuracy of the movie, as compared to the comic books, but it was definitely a fun and enjoyable movie for us to watch together as a family.",1452729600,,434,4.240963855421687

7281089,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Probably my favorite Marvel movie so far. Love Paul Rudd, was skeptical of his ability to convince me he was a super hero, but he pulled it off nicely. Such a funny movie, well written, well made, I mean it's Marvel, they've pretty much been killing it ever since they came out with they're own studio.",1452643200,,302,4.410714285714286
7281090,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"I have to admit that I was not expecting to be so entertained by this movie. I'm not a big fan of Paul Rudd, but he is very good in this movie as are all of the other actors. It was cool seeing the graphic effects that made Michael Douglas look so much younger in the beginning of the film.

It's a fun movie and definitely not a waste of time. I lean more toward Marvel characters and I like that they add scenes at the end of the movie and at the end of the credits.",1452643200,,468,3.8247422680412373

7281092,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"I ordered and watched this movie over the holidays of 2015 in December.  It was better than I expected it to be.  I expected it to be a dumb comic book movie, that portrays the fictional character more cheesy than is believable as a comic book hero.  This movie is enjoyable and somewhat interesting, but it does not have enough to do another in the future, sad for Paul Rudd, but they probably will.  Rudd was pretty good in this role, which I did not expect and the plot was both flowing and had a pretty good ending.  Tying it to the Marvel Group and Avengers saga was complete in the final scene.",1452643200,,600,4.274336283185841

7281096,1,B00ZGDIGZ2,"So I'm half way through this movie. At this point I am totally disappointed. Here's why: Bad execution! Lip synching in studio is off and poorly mixed to the point there is so much separation in the actors' audio from the video it feels like there should be a split screen showing the video footage and the actors in the studio doing their audio overdubs. It feels more like a ""Behind The Scene"" ""Making of Ant Man"" kind of effect. Regarding the lead actor(s), the lead actor doesn't have a 'Hero's' command/presence, or voice. Quite the contrary, the lead actor, whom I loved in 40 Year Old Virgin, and other movies (he's really good when cast correctly), is rather effeminate and weak, both vocally and physically. Why cast an otherwise wimp as a superhero, unless this is, in fact, a clear part of the plot? The lead actor has essentially no detectable muscle mass to the point of looking like he's never even exercised a day in his life. Really pathetic look for a so-called superhero! This is what America has devolved into...Weakness! And America now loves their males to be weak, and the weaker the better. Hollywood, or, the great facilitator of the emasculation of men in America, and augmenter of the false hope of 'girl power,' is perpetrating a massive fraud on consumers and stealing all the entertainment value from everything. It's a philosophy of 'The Weaker The Man The Better!' American women, whom are the primary consumers of entertainment products, and who would rather see all men under their weak little thumbs, today don't want to feel at all threatened by a big strong man on the big screen, so Hollywood now casts these little weakling men, more often than not, as superheroes whom, in reality, could not even bench press their own body weight. This oppressive, emasculation of men theme ruins the experience altogether, especially when the female enters the movie as a 'bad ass' who's going to teach the little sissy male actor how to fight. Yeah right! America will promote any little girl as a super bad-ass who could kick a real-mans ass if it will ""Sell Tickets!"" And it does, but only to females who love to vicariously experience being tougher than a man. It's a nice escape into an unreality for brute-minded American women, who suffer from a profound 'Penis Envy.' Ok, so now you know that America is both 'Female' and 'Weak.' Also, the music is trite, and very uninspiring, to the point of being obnoxious. The cumulative effect here is the feeling that this is Hollywood throwing, yet again, another feminized comic against the wall to see if it will stick, with not a single executive giving a crap if it actually makes any money...the old 'you can make more money off of a 'loser' than a hit mindset.' Maybe this movie was just a 'Tax Write Off' for the movie studio, and investors. Who knows; however, everything points that way. In short, I this pathetic flick is yet another manifestation of the dominant female influence in America...which has killed all hope of ever getting some real 'male entertainment' out of Hollywood, and as well destroyed all hope of this country ever becoming great again. Once I watch the next half of this movie if I should change my mind at all about this movie being part and parcel to the ongoing and growing female-driven ""Male-Weakness Paradigm"" in America I'll revise my review, otherwise I can't express how utterly disappointing this movie is thus far. I'm totally hate-watching now!",1452556800,3,3462,4.781302170283807
7281097,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"One of the latest Marvel CU additions. I liked the writing and action scenes; definitely a little different than the Avenger's, but Paul Rubb did great (even though I feel like they probably could have as easily made the ""origin"" story with Henry and Janet since they were canon Avenger founders in the comics). Either way, I'm looking forward to Rudd showing up in Civil War this spring.
The CG was fantastic, compared to Captain America #1; don't know if it's technology improvements or what, but it felt seamless and I rarely felt like I could tell that it was CGI.",1452556800,,568,4.633663366336633

If a company is going to offer something at this price they really need to make sure its shipped and packaged well and that it is in the correct packaging.

7281112,2,B00ZGDIGZ2,"The parts when everything is shrunk/ maximized are amazing. The humor is well done and led by Micheal Pena, who slayed it everytime he had dialogue. Rudd, when allowed to, is very good in his role. The daughter is cool and kicks butt. Stoll was creepy and easily recognizable as bad guy. Micheal Douglas was horrible both as the character and who the character was. The character refuses to show any love, kindness or give any information to his daughter for 30+ years. ONE SENTENCE would explain everything (I accidentally killed your mom with my science). However he allows her to suffer alone since the age of 7 and wonder what happen. He never comforts her or trys to build a relationship with her. Then a young man he mentors, he abandons without any explanation also. Since he was such an ***hole, I couldn't enjoy the rest of the movie. All I could think was 'what a horrible father and man'. I have never seen a person that I hated more than him. Plus it was poorly acted so it wasn't even a ""love to hate"" character either. Kill Micheal Douglas' character and the movie would have improved drastically.",1452384000,,1111,4.5879396984924625

If you're looking for a fun, entertaining, CGI packed , fantasy flick, this is your stop.  They are very true to the ""comic book"" feel to which they owe their genesis.  Great escape.

Four stars because the DVD version doesn't contain the post credit scenes.  My copy was missing the scene with Hope & the WASP suit and the scene that preps up Captain America-Civil War (Anthony Mackie-Falcon suggesting Ant-Man to Cap-Chris Evans).  Very disappointed by this as they were in the theatrical version.  When people spend money on the DVD, they deserve (expect, rightly) to receive the film in its entirety.

It hit a lot of the same notes as the original Iron Man, which is still the best of the trilogy. Rudd comes across charming and likable and while there were a few moments that induced an eyeroll here and there, by and large Ant-Man produced a lot of laughs and once again proves that Marvel knows how to pull off a quality movie (even with all of the drama behind the production of this one). The video and audio quality are pristine, the special features are a bit on the light side but still entertaining. Worth watching to be sure.",1452211200,,649,4.241935483870968

7281210,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Not the best of the Marvel films, but wonderfully inventive. As I watched this in the theater I kept thinking about how so much of what I was seeing on the screen was completely original. How often do you hear that about a film? The pros of the film include the effects, costumes, and overall story execution. At times the dialogue and acting is stiff, and the humor will fall flat more than it should, but this is because of the risks the movie is taking as opposed to the writers/director playing it safe. Where does it rank in comparison to the other Marvel films? Although it's an apples/oranges comparison, it probably falls somewhere in the upper third, after the Captain America series, first Iron Man, and Avengers movie.",1451779200,,729,4.658914728682171

Meanwhile, i was cracking up! I absolutely loved this movie. I mean, it's ANT MAN...you can't really take this serious. It's not Captain America, Iron Man or the Avengers, yet Ant Man has some serious powers. This movie, while Marvel, was not what is typically expected. With that said, i would highly recommend for those with younger kids. None of the intense plot drama, insane violence and theatrics that other marvel movies have. Paul Rudd was absolutely perfect in this role, i really thought this was a slam dunk on a lesser known character that's usually just overlooked.

7281271,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Not my favorite Marvel film, but it's definitely a worthy installment into the MCU. I don't think it's any secret that Marvel has been on a total high for several years now. Coming from a company that was near bankruptcy at a point in time, these guys have truly climbed back up on that horse. I was thrown back a bit when I heard Paul Rudd was going to be headlining a Marvel movie. I enjoy his work but it just didn't click for me in the beginning hearing he would be Ant-Man. But, of course I should've just accepted and trusted them because Marvel hasn't truly let me down yet. There have been bumps but nothing that has taken them off course in my opinion. Paul Rudd delivers a great performance as Scott Lang, the supporting cast was good, Michael Pena being the standout. I hope he gets parts in more Marvel films in the future, because he was a highlight here. There are some great visual effects here, great action, great comedy, pretty much exactly what you look for in these movies. The final fight in this film has also become one of my favorites so far in any of the MCU movies. I can't wait for Ant-Man and Star Lord to meet, plenty of great moments to be had there.

Overall this was great, and i'm happy with my purchase. Can't wait to see the next in line for Marvel.",1451520000,,1284,4.283950617283951

I was at first upset at how Dr. Henry Hank Pym was not in Avengers (both ones) since he and Wasp were founding members of the Avengers (I mean Wasp coined the term ""Avengers"") and how Dr. Pym didn't create Ultron as he did in the books. But Marvel surprised me (which they desperately needed after AoU). Marvel answered my questions of where Han and Janet were in the first movie within the 15 minute mark. It had the right amount of action and drama to humor that the movie needed without taking itself to seriously or becoming completely ridiculous. This movie is up there with my favorites like Captain America Winter Soldier. All in all...I really liked this movie",1451520000,2,716,4.645669291338582
7281288,3,B00ZGDIGZ2,"I have mixed feelings about this movie.  Everything it does right, it does brilliantly and it does almost everything right.  I have two problems with it, though.

The first is that Paul Rudd (director) and Edgar Wright (screenplay) seem to miss each other sometimes.  There are a few scenes--specifically Luis' story scenes--that were clearly written with Wright's directing in mind, but Rudd's directing just didn't do them justice.  In the end, it's a small gripe because almost every other scene is brilliant and the size dynamics are inspired.

Now, my big, BIG gripe with the movie is one that probably flew past most viewers.  This movie is so white, and so male.  I'm going to list a bunch of things.  The movie gets a pass for one or two, but when they're combined chafes badly. The sidekick character, Luis is a mish-mash of awful stereotypes with his hammy the accent, his uneducated speaking, and his van's horn ""La Cucaracha.""  Luis' friends are even worse, they're very one-note.  The daughter is pushed to the side (the post-credit scene doesn't count).  The daughter becomes the love interest (I yelled at the screen).  The bad guy is the darkest skinned of the leads is money grubbing and played by an actor of Jewish descent.  The Falcon's treatment was so frustrating; he was scripted like a blacksploitation character (I yelled at the screen several times).",1451520000,,1376,4.9004329004329

First of all, I enjoy the Marvel movies, but my favorites are not the typical ones like Avengers, THOR, or Ironman. They are great but not my favorites.  My favorite so far is ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and ""Ant-man"" is a close second.

This movie has plenty of action, lots of humor, a decent bad guy, and fun resolution.

I hope to see Ant-man showing up in more Marvel movies in the future.

I'm a fan!

I like the casting, character development, plot twists and turns, a reluctant hero, and who doesn't pull for the good guy to do the good thing?

My only, ONLY, beef with this movie was the language.  While it wasn't rampant, there was no need for it at all.  The foul language did not add anything to the scenes and would not take away from the scenes to not include the language.  One of the best lines of the movie, which was included in the trailer, was Paul Rudd telling Michael Douglas his ""days of breaking in and stealing stuff"" were over to which Douglas responds that he needs Rudd to break in and ""steal some stuff"".  This was hilarious in the preview.  When the time came for the line in the movie, I was greatly disappointed to hear the word ""stuff"" exchanged for another word.  WHY?  There is no need.

Aside from the foul language, which as I said is pretty minimal, I still love this movie as do my kids.  My 4 year old was Ant Man for Halloween!",1451433600,,1065,4.318181818181818

7281318,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"When talking to friends who had seen Ant-man, the general consensus was 'Eh, its alright. Pretty standard'.  Ok, so I made no rush to see this in theaters.

What. A. Mistake.

By no means is this the best Marvel film, and its certainly not perfect.  However, I think people have forgotten what makes comic-book films so enjoyable, and that is seeing ordinary people be able to do the extraordinary with positive motivation, determination and most importantly, heart.

What works in Ant-man:
- Grounded characters, including a regular Joe who's made poor decisions in his life, given the opportunity to turn it all around
- A technology genius who is anti-Stark and anti-government
- Light hearted (yes, most Marvel films are heavy handed on comedic one-liners, but it makes sense here in context w/ Ant-man)
- A hero that doesn't take himself too seriously
- A cameo by an Avenger
- A wonderfully trippy, 70's sci-fi-esque scene near the end that I think a lot of people are overlooking
- Events and motivations that actually make sense

What didn't work:
- Yes, the ants are kind of silly
- Final showdown is rushed
- There are some typical/standard action/comic book movie moments

While this isn't as great as Avengers 1, Captain America 2 or Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-man is actually much more entertaining than Avengers: Age of Ultron, which featured a lot of nothing covered in explosions.

You probably don't need to own Ant-man per se, but you sure as heck don't need to own Avengers 2 either.  Rent it, keep your expectations low (but not negative), and enjoy what may be the last 'feel good' Marvel movie you'll see in a while (at least until GotG 2 or Marvel's Spider-man).",1451347200,,1687,4.769759450171821

I have seen Paul Rudd in a few other movies that are all comedic so seeing him as Ant-Man with that mix of drama was nice to see. I have to say the whole idea of controlling ant's and working with them in the way he did was really cool. I love AnTony! I was getting attached to the animal pal in this as I usually do.

 I'm very interested to see what they do in the sequel with the way things ended. It was positive but also left you wanting to know much much more! I know the sequels title is Ant-Man and The Wasp so that gives us a little teaser to hold on to! All I know is I want more Ant-Man...and AnTony!",1451260800,,733,3.88

The exception would be the Ironman movies which Downey tries very hard to make irrelevant, irreverant and silly all the way. Hats off to everyone of the actors of the Ant-man movie. They all did a wonderful job of keeping the movie suitably fun while not doing any disservice to the movie. Fantastic. Thank you. Don't miss this movie. See it at all costs. Rudd is comparable to Downey and should be paid as much as Downey. I hope they do not mess with the vibe when they make Ant-man 2",1451088000,,655,4.6068376068376065

Paul Rudd is terrible, the premise is completely ridiculous (and I don't mean the plot of a man shrinking), Evangeline Lilly plays the same character she played in lost and that robot fighting movie (great range she has).  Michael Douglas is wasted. Michael Pena is hilarious and needs more screen time.  But overall, the action, special effects, storyline, and script are some of the worst I've seen in a while. I expected much more. I don't get how this has such highly rated reviews.

Also, Paul Rudd historically hasn't been an action movie guy.  I just rented it and have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  Good story and I thought Michael Douglas did a good job as well.  However, I was surprised with all of the swearing in it.  The film makers that make the super hero movies have to realize that young kids are going to be interested in them as well.  Maybe I'm a little more sensitive to it as I have 3 young kids and I'm disappointed that there are good movies out there, that my kids could possibly watch, but they have to throw a few swear words in there to get a PG-13 or R rating.

Instead it's a Tony Stark rival with his own new technology a la the incredible shrinking man. Except he becomes Tarzan of the Ants. Not as bad as you might think. In fact, quite funnier that the Avengers poking fun at all sorts of things. Lots of good supporting actors with good developed personas. I was looking for a fun adventure, and this was it. I only give five stars to real classics with deep social commentary. Almost gave it five.",1450137600,,593,4.4
7281454,3,B00ZGDIGZ2,"This movie is by far, the weakest of the recent entries in the Avenger universe.  I just thought that the premise of the story was absurd regarding the hero's abilities and feel that Marvel is scraping the bottom of the barrel regarding its properties.  The image of Paul Rudd riding a mind-controlled ant looked ludicrous.  With that being said, I did enjoy the light-hearted tone of the movie.  It doesn't take itself too seriously like the movie Thor and falls somewhere between a comedy and an action movie, similar with Guardians of the Galaxy, yet with less imagination.  Paul Rudd is an acquired taste who always seems to play cute for the camera, though I liked Michael Douglass as the crassy mentor.

I like everyone else in the movie too.  Paul's character was great.  The bad guy wasn't very believable to me, but he did okay.  Two gripes, and why I give it 3 stars,  (tiny spoiler) is the story kind of fell apart, for me, when the bad guy, was totally, 100%, ready for what they planned.  I mean, completely.  It's like he was in on the plans or was the mastermind himself.  That was a bit weak.  The other part, and I am much more forgiving here, is when the ant-man, on his 1st frigin' mission, had to go sub-atomic.  I mean really?  I know these movies are make believe pulled from comic books ( I read them too growing up), but sometimes all you need is a good story, not saving the world, pushing it to the edge in every movie.  Not every movie has to out do itself the next time, or the other movie that just came out.

Definitely worth the watch, if a fan of superheroes, Marvel, and/or Ant-man.  I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could.",1450137600,,1106,4.112676056338028

7281468,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Fun flick. Enjoyed Paul Rudd as an action hero. Lost a star due to lack of females in the film. Casting in this film is great and only one actor stood out as being wooden...in the opening scene but luckily he's never seen again...

They could have cast ONE female in the film as one of the ""criminal"" on Ant-Man's team.  The ex-wife doesn't count in the film because she's barely on-screen.  The daughter, Hope, is GREAT and we look forward to her in the sequel.
Love the healthy dose of humor.

7281474,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Very enjoyable because of Rudd.

You don't need to be a giant Rudd fan (I'm indifferent), you just have to find his quick wit and delivery entertaining - so think back to 40 year old virgin, role models, I love you man... if you liked him and thought ""this smarts$$ is entertaining"" then you'll enjoy this.

I know nothing of the comics, so as a comic-luddite, there is NOTHING compelling to me about the Ant-Man characters... the genesis, the science behind his character... it seems like Marvel is just pulling everything it can out of the pile to try and cash in. That said, I laughed and enjoyed this movie exclusively because of Rudd -- and a few other characters, like his ""bro"".

Really well-cast movie and a pretty sharp script (good dialog) and it all works.

I found my brain hurting during fight scenes trying to reason if he was fighting the most effectively he good be... big-PUNCH, small-KICK, big-FLIP, small-THROW toy train... given the rules of the universe, would it have been better if he was just small that entire time? Or big? Or why is he throwing the toy pieces, don't they just do normal toy-damage? Why didn't that item he threw when tiny travel at like 10x the speed it would if he threw it as an adult?

7281481,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"This is a great movie for the entire family. It is fairly safe for young and old alike. Considering most movies these days, this is one of the better movies if you are looking for low profanity, non-graphic violence and minimal innuendo.

The movie is fun, full of action, comedy and graphics.

This movie is slightly on a different level than the other superhero movies. It is taken less seriously. I think it comes across this way because it made to be as much of a comedy as it is a superhero/action movie. It is also geared toward a younger audience. This isn't a hard-core superhero movie. It's more Disney-like but not to the point of being cheesy.

They 'kill' a lamb. It is not graphic but still ... stuff like that bothers some people, including me. The machine magically zaps the lamb and reduces it to a small blob of reddish goo. This is also done to a human earlier in the movie but I didn't care.

Paul Rudd did an excellent job with a good blend of humor and superhero. Hope he returns as ANT-MAN.

One star deducted for killing a cute lamb. NEVER kill cute critters in a movie. If you want the 'location' of the scene, go to the comment section.

7281495,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Ant Man continues the Marvel Cinematic universe, set after the events of The Age of Ultron. It even ties back somewhat to Agent Carter Hailey Atwell and John Slattery appear as aged versions of Agent Carter and Howard Stark at the beginning of the movie as a set up to the rest of the plot. There are even tie ins to the next Captain America movie (with a post credits scene) and ultimately to the Avengers Infinity wars movies (which will include Ant Man).

Without giving too much away, Michael Douglas's character Hank Prym one of the original S.H.E. I. L.D. agents, and inventor of the ant man suit, a technology that allows humans to shrink to the size of an ant, and gain the equivalent of an ant's strength to its size hires burglar Scott Lang, played by Paul Rudd to break into his former company and steal a second suit being developed by Prym's one time protege now rival Darren Cross (played by House of Cards' Cory Stoll). Evangeline Lilly plays Hope van Dyne, Prym's daughter who reluctantly helps Lang train to become ant man.

At its core the film is a heist movie wrapped up in a superhero movie. It is like Oceans 11 meets The Avengers. It does very well as the origin story for the various stand alone characters, yet blends into the existing Marvel Universe, with the biggest cross-over being the meeting between Ant Man and Falcon about halfway into the movie. Paul Rudd does a great job with being a hero that is on the fringe of being a true good guy, who is willing to break the rules or the law to do the right thing. He also brings an air of every man with a smart ass quality that he is know for from his other work. It has a lot of the humor that many of Marvel Films have had in doses.

For those who get the actual disc, the movie looks and sounds great on blu ray. I have the one disc version, which for extras has a few short behind the scenes and making of features, about 10 min worth of ""news"" footage that help flesh out some of the character's backgrounds, some deleted scenes and a gag reel. Good for what is there. I think those who are fans of the Marvel Universe movies and TV shows will enjoy this. It is also different enough that if you are having super hero movie fatigue, you can find it enjoyable because it is definitely not like any of the ones that have come before it. While some of it is a bit silly to be sure (but really all the superhero movies are to some extent) this movie plays on that a bit and almost does it tongue in cheek. The acting is very good, it it does well staying on the fringes of the larger story, while telling its own.",1449878400,,2593,4.255578093306288

Hank Pym, founder of the company Pym Technologies, develops a formula that shrinks all matter including living tissue and combined with his armored suit he is the first Ant Man.  He quits his own company to hide his secrets before they can become weaponized  Dr. Cross now owns the company and he wants to crack the secrets of Pyms success to become wealthy by selling the secrets of the shrinking formula and a weaponized battle suit to the highest bidders, good or bad.

Scott Lang  is a Electrical Engineer released from prison.  He wants to go straight but can't get a job or make enough money to pay off his child support to allow him to see his daughter. He helps plan a break-in and robbery. Pym intercedes into Scott's life and recruits Scott to stop Dr. Cross and save the world

The storyline is well written and the actors do a good job playing their roles.  I like the film and I am glad that I saw the movie.  It is worth buying and watching.

Oh man was I wrong I enjoyed it just as much as the two Captain America movies and the first Avengers movie (sorry age of ultron was great but it kind of fell short on a few things) I am super impressed with the cast they were awesome! But the thing that really got my attention was the amount of easter eggs in the bonus features if you get the chance to watch the WHICH News front it really dives deep into the MCU It really hints at where their world is with the events of Age of Ultron leading to C.A.:Civil War if you pay very close attention to the scrolling news at the bottom of the screen you will find a few hints about how Cap's new movie will be opening up and some of the factors that drove Hulk to do what he did. I'm excited to see if marvel can carry on with keeping people interested in their films now and that's all because of The Antman movie it's very fresh, exciting and, to be honest I feel it was a huge risk that paid off in the end!",1449792000,,1095,3.981818181818182

This is how the story goes: Armed with a super-suit with the astonishing ability to shrink in scale but increase in strength, cat burglar Scott Lang must embrace his inner hero and help his new mentor, Dr. Hank Pym, plan and pull off a heist that will save the world.

The cast led by Paul Rudd (as Scott Lang) (who also co-wrote the screenplay) is great. The directing by Peyton Reed is great. The story by Edgar Wright (who also executive produced) & Joe Cornish & the screenplay by Wright, Cornish, Rudd & Adam McKay, both of which are based on the comic book by Stan Lee (who also executive produced), Larry Lieber & Jack Kirby is great.

The music by Christophe Beck is great. The cinematography by Russell Carpenter is great. The film editing by Dan Lebenthal & Colby Parker Jr. is great. The casting by Sarah Halley Finn is great. The production design by Shepherd Frankel is great. The art direction by Cameron Beasley, Nigel Churcher, Jann K. Engel, David Lazan & Justin O'Neal Miller is great. The set decoration by Leslie A.

The special effects supervised by Daniel Sudick is great. The stunts coordinated by James M. Churchman, Jeff & Trevor Habberstad and fights coordinated by Peng Zhang & Walter Garcia is great.

This is a great, fun, well-done, well-made movie that is entertaining and well-crafted. Paul Rudd is solid as usual as Scott Lang / Ant-Man. Peyton Reed has done a great job directing. This is (or was) one of the better movies of the summer season and also of the year, as well, too. It was also one of the best action films of the year, as well.",1449792000,3,2766,5.06140350877193
7281522,3,B00ZGDIGZ2,"This movie was very middle of the road to me, defiantly not what I've come to expect from a Marvel movie. It just fell flat. The jokes were something you'd expect a 5 year old to tell, the actors seemed to have no chemistry at all, and I found myself bored. My mind kept wandering to other things, less boring things like laundry and whether or not I paid the gas bill. I certainly won't be watching this one again.",1449792000,,415,4.2

7281526,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"I am a fan of Marvel movies but Antman was one that I was not so sure about prior to watching as it was not a superhero comic that I really followed as a kid.  I also wasn't too sure that Paul Rudd was the right fit for a superhero.  After watching I will say that I was pleasantly surprised as this was one of Marvels better comic book adaption efforts.  Of course with any new superhero character, there is a lot of background story that gives the movie a bit of a slow start but it is expected and doesnt hurt the overall story.  This movie has a really good story with good action and special effects and the right amount of humor that isn't overdone.  I was also surprised that Rudd did a really good job in the role with good comedic timing that really fit well with the character.  Douglas was also good as Pym as well as the supporting cast of characters including the team who added some really funny moments.  Stoll also plays the villain nicely as well and the story is a great way to introduce the character.  I also liked the way they tie it into the Avengers storyline.

All in all, this is a fun and full of action superhero movie with a good story that impressed me as one of the better efforts from Marvel which really surprised me as I was less familiar with this superhero as I was with Ironman and the rest of the Avengers.

7281527,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"This is a fine movie.  The screenplay could have used a bit more work to make sure stuff made sense...like at what point did the bad guy go crazy and when was he just evil?  And give at least some idea about how the ant control works.  Also the physics.  Does mass change when you change size?  How was he jumping so high it looked like flying?  What were the ""effects"" that made it so Dr. Pym couldn't do the work himself?  And why not use his daughter?  None of that stuff made 100% sense.

But it was a fun movie.  Pretty good considering ant-man is not one of the most popular of the Avengers characters.  It's a good watch, but requires a little more tolerance than some of the other super hero movies coming out recently",1449705600,,726,4.226277372262774

On the other hand though, I am 37 and not the audience they are going for. My 16 year old son loved it. I did think this was the most entertaining one in a while and it was very funny and inventive.

While Marvel always has some predictability involved (throw in a mix of Tony Stark, Avengers references, and good vs. evil), I genuinely felt like this movie brought a fresh take on the super hero genre.  Paul Rudd proved and unexpected hero and really kicked butt with the help of his ant buddies and Thomas the Train.

7281600,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,Big fan of Marvel and most of the shows they do. I have never really followed Ant man in the comics so I had my reservations about this movie. I typically buy Marvel movies because I watch them a few times for the things I missed. I ended up taking a leap and buying Ant Man it was well worth it.

7281627,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"I think this is probably the best way to illustrate Ant Man.

It takes a truly GREAT movie to impel me to, actually, purchase it and watch it more than two times, which hardly happens.  Ant-Man is definitely that kind of movie for me.

The new Hollywood seems to pander to the lowest denominator of one action scene after another & the length of those scenes is ridiculous.

But they do not take the epic/superhero point of view, but present it more from the POV of a comedic heist movie, and I think this was a great decision. It leaves the possibility for him to be strong, heroic and courageous, but leave it at that; an origin.

7281718,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Marvel bring a new Super-Hero into our mist........
'Scott Lang' (Paul Rudd) has just been released from prison after serving a 3 year sentence, he's a thief, a highly
skilled thief but a thief none-the-less.
He wants to go straight, having a steady job and staying out of trouble is a pre-condition laid down by his former
wife 'Maggie' (Judy Greer) allowing him again to build a relationship and have regular access to his daughter
'Cassie' (Abby Ryder Fortson) however there is a problem, nobody wants to give regular employment to an ex-con.
'Scott' is in a desperate position, he needs funds even though he doesn't want to return to prison or indeed let his
daughter down, but, what choice has he ?
Many years ago (late 80's) Dr Hank Pym' (Michael Douglas) owned and ran a large company, as a Scientist he was
thought to have developed a way of shrinking a man to the size of an ant, he denied that he'd perfected the method,
realizing that should such a discovery fall into the wrong hands it could have catastrophic consequences and
implications for the whole of mankind, he'd denied his protege 'Darren Cross' (Corey Stoll) the means to replicate his
formula.
'Darren Cross' now owner of the company has spent years trying to perfect what he believes his mentor had indeed
created, he's getting close to being able to replicate the process and will have no qualms in selling it on....'Dr Pym'
who's daughter 'Hope' (Evangelline Lilly) 'holds a position of trust in 'Cross's' organisation which is how the doctor is
aware just how close he has come.
'Dr Pym' needs someone to use the suit he'd developed and held onto years before to create an 'Ant-man' someone
capable of having a chance no-matter how small to infiltrate 'Cross's' operations preventing him from being able to
profit from the creation developed years before, which is where 'Scott' comes in, the doctor had admired the skills and
resourcefulness of the thief for some time and now makes his move to enlist him.....'Scott' will need to learn many skills
before becoming operational as Ant-Man including the ability to have ants follow his wishes......the Worlds security will
depend upon his ability to do so.
The film does, even more than the other Marvel movies in many ways relies heavily on the use of special-effects, however
it does come together and indeed work as a spectacle, plenty of action sequences along with several moments that will
bring a smile to your face..........as an earlier reviewer pointed out the interaction with an Avenger not really necessary as
it is obvious without it, the Ant-Man is set to join the elite group at some stage....
Well worth the viewing especially if you enjoy Marvel adventures.

7281725,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Ant Man was really a lot of fun! The special effects were a hoot. The expected Marvel Universe thrills were there with plenty of action, fight scenes, explosions and fast paced adventure. But part of the fun was that Ant Man is a heist movie with some techno pseudoscience and sci-fi visuals that rapidly turn the show into a roller coaster ride. On top of that, the humor is almost non stop. Then you get just a touch of expected Marvel teasing, which manages to perfectly segue from silliness and action into goose bumps on your neck heroism. I became an Ant Man fan. Ant Man is a very close run with Guardians of the Galaxy!  Marvel pulled off the same thing with Guardians of the Galaxy. Iron Man was cool. But a talking raccoon that happens to be a space pirate is hard to beat. Check your brain at the door and become a kid again. I added it to my collection of keepers.",1448582400,2,876,4.3090909090909095
7281726,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Best Marvel effort since Captain America: The First Avenger. I'm a fan of all the Marvel films, but like the first Cap movie, Ant-Man stands out for me because of its uniqueness - it doesn't feel similar to any other MCU effort out there. Paul Rudd was amazing, as was the entire cast, but Rudd, along with the screenwriters and filmmakers turned a character who never really stood out to me as a kid reading comics and elevated Ant-Man to leading man status. This movie has it all really, great tension, some laughs, a dash of romance, cool techie/superhero stuff but above all else, it has heart. The ability to humanize the Ant-Man character, whether it happens to be Hank Pym or Scott Lang wearing the tech, is what makes this film a true stand out. I also love-loved the Pym Marvel historical origin story aspect of the film - and the friggin' suit, which had a vintage-cool vibe that added a level of realism for me. I want that suit! Looking forward to seeing more Ant-Man on the big screen, whether it be in stand-alone films or as part of the greater Avengers universe.",1448582400,7,1078,4.533333333333333

7281784,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"I didn't have high hopes for this movie. The idea of Paul Rudd carrying a superhero movie didn't exactly fill me with enthusiasm. It was just a matter of time however, as I'd seen all the other Marvel Cinematic Universe movies and had no good reason to skip this one. In the end, I enjoyed it. I wasn't sure for about the first 1/3 of the movie, but I slowly warmed to Scott Lang's character and the supporting cast (e.g., Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Pea). As a longtime comic book enthusiast, I had some minor issues with the story, specifically Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas' character). MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD: In the comics, Hank Pym is an absolute bastard, which is mostly glossed-over in this retelling. There are also some very glaring logic problems with a key sub-plot (i.e., going sub-atomic) in the movie. But all that aside, the movie makers did a good job taking a strange superhero (albeit one of the founding Avengers) and making a fun movie out of it (one that I've now seen 3 times).",1448323200,2,1013,4.633333333333334
7281785,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,Great movie. Kinda has a Guardian's of the Galaxy vibe. The coolness plus the humor. Really liked it! Look forward to seeing more of this character!,1448323200,,148,4.730769230769231
7281786,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Marvel continues to lead the way with their movies!! Great casting and truly enjoyable for all ages.

7281797,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"A lot of people were surprised by this movie - I wasn't. Marvel Studios has had an excellent track record in my opinion and the films keep getting better and better... I was hoping they would slate in an Ant-Man sequel and showcase The Wasp much more and they announced recently that the sequel entitled ANT-MAN AND THE WASP will be coming out in 2018! Both The Astonishing Ant-Man and The Winsome Wasp have been mainstays in the Marvel Universe since it began in the 1960's and were original members of The Avengers even before Captain America joined so it's about time they finally got their due - I'm not going to go over and review the story this is just to let people who are or became fans of this film to know there will be a sequel. For my part this is one of the top 5 MCU films and my second favorite MCU character now.
1. Captain America the First Avenger. 2. Captain America the Winter Soldier. 3. Avengers Age of Ultron. 4. Guardians of the Galaxy and 5. Ant-Man in that order. Can you tell I'm a huge Captain America fan (pssst plus I was an Extra/Background Actor in Winter Soldier as well). I also just finished watching Marvel Netflix Jessica Jones and some will be surprised how graphic it is - but I absolutely loved it! It's a hard-hitting, gritty, graphic, intense, crime-drama that introduces Jessica Jones, Patsy Walker aka Hellcat, Luke Cage, Kilgrave played wonderfully by David Tennant and the Daredevil villain/character Nuke to the MCU. Netflix is becoming the best TV corner of the MCU and next year is Luke Cage introducing Misty Knight and hopefully Iron Fist, as well as Daredevil Season 2 which will introduce the MCU versions of Elektra and The Punisher - can't wait to see Scott Lang aka Ant-Man's next appearance in Captain America Civil War plus the introduction of Black Panther and the MCU Spider-Man in that as well... I think comic fans need to get over the idea that these shows/films are NOT flat out comic book adaptations but they ARE a variation on the characters that they love - and in my opinion Marvel is handling it perfectly... Can't wait to see what's going on in 2016 which will be Captain America Civil War and Doctor Strange on the cinema front. Luke Cage and Daredevil Season 2 on Netflix, more Agents of SHIELD Season 3 and Agent Carter Season 2 on ABC.
If you are a Marvel fan like I am then you can't wait for all of it - and will be so happy to see how the cinematic version of the Marvel Universe expands and expands - this is only the beginning... within 5 years will also have Thor 3, Black Panther, Captain Marvel, Spider-Man, Inhumans, Iron Fist, The Defenders, Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 & 3, Avengers Infinity War parts 1 & 2 and a whole lot more... The Marvel Cinematic Universe is just revving up!",1448323200,3,2771,4.4891089108910895

7281801,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,This was awesome!  Marvel made a film that catered to fans more than the general public on this one and it worked.  They played Henry Pim a solid by catching a lot of his character and giving us the Sci-Fi we love.  (I'm still a little bummed that he did not build Ultron.)  It is slower than the avengers and does not really have that abrupt comic book feel but it covered a lot of cool science fiction and introduced interesting characters that will not doubt appear again in the future.  Nice job Marvel.,1448236800,2,507,4.351063829787234

7281809,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"It amazed me how Marvel keeps turning their lesser known properties into the best movies. Ant-man, Daredevil, Guardians of the Galaxy and now Jessica Jones are, in my opinion, the best the MCU has to offer. Each show represents a different genre from gritty crime drama to space opera to detective story. Ant-man is a heist/action/comedy that delivers throughout. The story, pacing, acting and soundtrack are all top notch and it's family friendly to boot. Give it a watch, you'll love it.",1448236800,,489,4.975609756097561

The way that Marvel is bringing together so many different stories toward the ultimate showdown in Infinity War is amazing.  Agents of Shield, Jessica Jones (w/Luke Cage), and all the Phase 2 films are all slowly leading into the Civil War, which will undoubtedly be a pre-Infinity transition piece as well as the end of the line for Steve Rogers.

Comedic release is everywhere, but not overdone.  It's a part of the ludicrous fact that a man is now the size of an ant, things can be shrunk and enlarged, and the ants have personalities.  Yeah, it sounds like a children's movie, but this is a true-to-Marvel imagining of Ant Man.  That said, this one is also great for the whole family.  Nothing inappropriate.

Ant Man is more of a heist comedy with superheroes and special friends.  Falcon from the Avengers guest stars, and that battle proves Ant Man should be in the Avengers, which is fun.  There are references to Spidey, Stark, and other heroes.  There is also a great reveal during the credits.

Perfect acting all around.  Amazing special effects.  The ants are not corny, but realistic.

The villain is scary and unpredictable, but his new tech is more frightening.  Add to that the possibility of an army of tiny monster soldiers controlled by Hydra.  Very cool.  And the quantum physics angle is weird and horrifying.  Loved it.

7281886,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"I knew from the outset that Ant-Man would be a very difficult movie to make. There was ample opportunity for the movie to be way too dependent on special effects, or that the special effects might turn out to be not so special after all, or that the whole thing might slide over the edge of a cliff into an unintended campy, B-style movie that would be reminiscent of the drive-in movie days --I'm 61, so I know all about drive-in's.

  ;-)

In effect, the writers, directors, CGI wizards, producers, and others tasked with making this film had to thread the eye of a very small needle with a relatively large thread.

I'm happy to say that --at least for me-- they pulled it off.

The movie was flat-out hilarious at certain points, quite touching at times, and the special effects and action sequences were excellent. And it would be impossible in my estimation to have a more perfectly suited cast than Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/(New) Ant-Man, Michael Douglas as Hank Pym/(Original) Ant-Man, Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne/(Soon-to-be) Wasp, and Corey Stoll as Darren Cross/Yellow Jacket.

I also really enjoyed the 'heist film' aspect of the movie. It allowed the writers to construct additional characters (such as Lang's three 'burglar buddies') that they might not have been able to otherwise. I thought I was going to laugh so hard that something in my body might break when the ""back it up....back it up...baaaaaacccckkkk it up..."" scene was transpiring!

On the other hand, the movie certainly wasn't flawless, hence my 4-star rating.

This film leaned just slightly, at least in my mind, towards a younger movie goer --essentially, the producers seemed to be trying hard to make a film that was considerably less dark, gritty, and violent than, say, 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' (my favorite Marvel flick to date). But that's perfectly OK with me, as Marvel (unlike DC) seems to be comfortable making a movie where everything doesn't look like a crumbling quasi-Gothic disaster area, and all of the hero and villain characters aren't expected to speak in the exact same low-voiced tone and as if they have a wad of Red-Man chewing tobacco in their mouths (why yes, you are correct, I'm not a big fan of DC movies).

The other (slightly) annoying thing about this movie is that the writers and producers didn't take quite enough time with the details related to physical science. They can't be blamed totally for that, as even the Marvel Ant-Man comics struggled with reality when it came to Pym Particles and the physics behind them. For example, even if it was possible to compress atoms in the way Marvel depicts, the mass of the person/object would remain the same. No ant could support a 180 pound man, and no one would be able to tote a tank around in their pocket.

Luckily, I have learned how to effectively turn off the engineer/scientist part of me when I am watching science-fiction or super-hero movies, so I usually don't get too distracted by the inconsistencies and impossibilities often contained in them.

Overall, I think the movie hit its mark pretty well: It was very entertaining, funny when it needed to be, as believable as a movie about a shrinking man could possibly be, and all of the characters were well played by the respective actors.

You really can't ask for much more than that...

FYI: I started accumulating Marvel comics on a cross-country trip to Camp Pendelton, California (where my dad would be stationed for a couple of years) in 1963. In the succeeding years I continued to collect Marvel comics, and even a few from DC. At the end I had over 500 comics that included all of the original Fantastic Four editions, Spiderman 1-8 (and many more), and X-Men 1-12 (also with many more after that), plus all of the original Thor, Iron Man, Hulk, etc. comics. I sold the whole box of them to a Marine from Camp Lejeune, NC, where my dad worked, for $50 when I was 17. I'm pretty sure that box of comics --if I had them now-- would be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars...oh well, you win some and...",1447718400,5,4057,4.71994342291372

7281895,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"First, Id like to confirm that Ive not read the comic book on which the character of this movie is based. So, Im not comparing it to the book.

Second, below is my comment.

It has some witty and hilarious dialogues and scenes. For example, its amusing when Scott Lang (played by Paul Rudd), in the Antman suit, tries to jump through the keyhole of a door and fails. For instance, one of the funny dialogues is as follows:
Ex-convict to his ex-wife: Why did you marry a cop? You could have married somebody else.
Ex-wife: At least hes not a con.

To me, the idea that a person can shrink to the size of an ant and yet as strong as one is original and exciting (1).

The acting of Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly is engaging. Paul is believable in the role of Scott Lang who transforms from an ex-convict to the Antman and saves the world. Evangeline Lilly is convincing in the role of Hope van Dyne who constantly argues against her father, Dr. Hank Pym. Michael Douglas is interesting in the role of Dr. Hank.

Theres no nudity, and no swearing.

The special effect is a mixed bag. Its interesting in some scenes and looks fake in others. For example, it looks terrifying when the Antman is at the bottom of the bathtub and somebody is turning on the faucet. In another instance, the close-up of the ants head looks like a painting. However, this drawback does not affect the entertaining value of the film.

According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are its financial figures:

Release date:  July 17, 2015
Production Budget: $130 million
Domestic:  $179,750,975
Foreign:  $338,427,331
Worldwide:  $518,178,306

Wow! It has grossed more than 500 million dollars. Thats a lot of money.

Because of all the reasons above, this is a great family movie. It deserves 4 stars.

7281898,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"As you know, Ant-Man will be the final entry of Phase Two of the ever-expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe that started with Iron Man in 2008, but don't worry. You don't have to see any of the previous Marvel Comics movies to enjoy Ant-Man, an enjoyable action movie featuring an insect-sized hero with superhuman powers.

Paul Rudd is Scott Lang, a whistleblower and thief recently released from jail. He breaks into the house of Dr. Pym (Michael Douglas), former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and original Ant-Man. What Scott finds there is something interesting; the Ant-suit, a suit created by Hank Pym that can turn the wearer into Ant-Man.

So the film is about the second-generation Ant-Man, I mean, Scott, who trains to be a superhero in order to regain his daughters love (and save the world, too). Story-wise Ant-Man is pretty formulaic, but director Peyton Reed (Bring it on) keeps a good pace throughout, emphasizing the comical side of the situation in which our hero is in. The climactic one-on-one combat against the supervillain can be thrilling and funny at the same time.

As I said, Ant-Man can be enjoyed as a stand-alone action film, but some knowledge about the Marvel Comics would help, especially when a certain character appears, fighting Ant-Man in a unique and amusing combat sequence. And of course, don't miss the post-credits scene that suggests the beginning of Phase Three.",1447027200,,1393,5.021645021645021

of the ant, Ant Man is a happy, fun, and competent super hero,

Marvel heroes that have appear so often in our screens lately.

This could have been a Disney movie, since as I said there is no real violence,
the villain is kind of ridiculous, and Paul Rudd, with his baby face and comic lines,
makes the movie even lighter.

Of course the movie and the concept is interesting. The special effects are great,
especially the cosmos from the size of an ant, but also the action scenes, with
the alternation between the micro cosmos and the realy world being fantastic.

I left with a better feeling than after watching Age of Ultron.

I'm a huge Marvel fan and Antman has always been a favorite. I was sad when people didn't give this one a chance. Because it has got to be one of the best origin stories of the marvel super heroes ever and Antman has been underrated for a long time.

7281921,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"With a smaller, but certainly just as powerful punch comes the next chapter of the Marvel movies franchise, Ant-Man. This lesser known superhero finally gets his own spotlight and boy does he deliver. Action-packed with great special effects, Ant-Man is a movie that will have you laughing a lot and engrossed in the tiny superhero.
Ant-Man is a story like none of the other Marvel movies, one where the everyday citizen can actually relate to the main character. Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is an average joe just out of jail after he was caught burglarizing a company. Wanting to have money to pay child support so he can see his daughter, Scott takes on a job to steal what he thinks is money from a vault in a wealthy mans house. Its a bust though for all Scott finds is a suit and nothing else. But this isn't just an everyday motorcycle suit, its a suit that can shrink its wearer down to the size of an ant. Now as the wearer of this suit, Scott must stop the suits creators apprentice from recreating the suit and selling them to the evil organization that is Hydra.
Obviously Paul Rudd steals the show with his performance in this movie. This role was perfect for Rudd simply because Scott and Rudds personalities are one in the same. Rudds character would often tease his romantic interest, Hope (Evangeline Lilly), and also his daughter, Cassie (Abby Ryder), something Paul Rudd is quite known to do to his own wife and children. Rudds character was both fun, and exciting, and kept you wanting him to succeed every time. Corey Stolls (Yellowjacket) performance as the villain of this movie was also a success. Stolls character gives off a feel of a human bordering on their humanity, laughing as baby lambs die simply for testing his product. Truly encompassing the evil apprentice thats losing his mind, Stolls character was so well done that I even found myself hating him throughout the film.
The special effects of this movie were amazing, but what more do you expect, when it comes to Marvel movies, anything short of amazing won't do. A minimum amount of explosions worked really well with this movie, only really having one huge explosion allowed Ant-Man to feel more strategic rather than guns blazing.  With a movie like this, any bad special effects could degrade the movie greatly, but when Ant-Man went down to the size of an ant, one could feel like they were actually down there with him, a feeling i haven't felt since I watched Honey, I shrunk the kids when I was a little boy.
Ant-Man isn't the typical superhero movie, it strives on humor and strategy rather than the guns blazing action packed typical superhero movie. There may not be too much story of Ant-Man in this movie as some would like but from the after credits video we learn that Ant-Man will return, a good clue that some kind of sequel is to come. With a fun cast and great special effects, this movie was a lot of fun to watch and I am looking forward to any future installments of the ever lovable Ant-Man. Bring your family, bring your nerdy friends, hell, why not even bring your grandpa, this movie is great for any ages.",1443916800,4,3116,4.60431654676259

7281924,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Ant-Man is the final film in Marvels Phase Two of superhero movies. Its an odd note to end on, given that the story is much smaller in scale compared to the world ending madness that takes place in the more recent Avengers movie, but that self-contained quality is part of what makes it stand on its own, rather than be reduced to a mere footnote in their ever growing distribution of comic book action.

Its a composite of several genres and plots from other successful movies, making the entire premise of even a superhero that shrinks almost impossible to fail. It borrows the formula from The Mask of Zorro, in that this is not a straight origin but more of a passing of the torch from one hero to the next. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), the original Ant-Man, has long retired from the world saving business after a tragedy. His former protg, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), has been trying to replicate his old shrinking particles so he can sell it as the Yellow Jacket to anyone willing to pay his demands. His plot is basically the exact one from the first Iron Man, where Obadiah Stane was out to mass produce his own version of the Iron Man.

Hank Pym recruits Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), a thief recently released from prison, into his caper to steal and destroy the Yellow Jacket suit. It follows a basic formula; the first part of the movie is to detail Scotts situation and his motivations for turning back to crime. He needs cash for child support so he can visit his daughter, Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson). The middle of the story is the planning/training phase where the comedic heist montage is spliced in with the training montage to move things along at a brisk pace. We get to see Scott learn all of the suits abilities as Hank and his angry daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) show him the ropes. Shrinking, talking to ants, going on practice runs, etc.

While these components are familiar and will seem that way, what really sells the movie is the Ant-Man as a superhero. His powers are a major highlight and play out in a lot of fun ways that weve haven't really seen before. Its kind of a spin on The Incredible Shrinking Man or even Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, but in this case the power to be small is actually a legitimate advantage. These sequences are shot using a mix of green screen and macro-photography, and it gives them a fresh visual flare that makes them a lot more interesting to watch in comparison with the usual big CG action finales. These special effects are incredibly well done and used with surprising restraint. The action doesnt overstay its welcome and for the most part is quick and to the point. Seeing the unique Ant-Man powers onscreen brings a lot of imagination and creativity to the story.

Another strong feature is the acting and the overall scale. Paul Rudd plays Scott as charming as youd expect, but perhaps not quite as funny as youd assume. Hes a bit more somber for a Marvel hero, and it makes sense given his situation. Michael Douglas is reminiscent of the casting of Robert Redford in Captain America: The Winter Soldier in that by playing Hank Pym, he adds a lot of credibility to the story, giving the old mentor a sense of stature and a believably troubled history. Fatherhood seems to be a key theme in the movie, with Hanks approval serving as the central goal for various characters. Scotts relationship with his own daughter seems to be a mirror of Hank and Hopes, and as the new Ant-Man hes also trying to live up to the originals reputation. As his somewhat estranged daughter, Hope is trying to get Hank to open up to her, and even Darren Cross seems to be motivated mostly by a twisted sense of abandonment from his former mentor.

Speaking of, Corey Stoll as the villain turns out a very charismatic performance that only made me wish he had more to do in the story. After his initial scenes setting up his motives, we get very little with him until the heist is underway. Its a shame, because he adds a little something extra to what is otherwise another generic Marvel supervillain.

Another aspect worth mentioning is the score by Christophe Beck. It doesnt have an especially memorable melody per se (nothing to compete with some of the classics of John Williams or Danny Elfman), but its got a lively beat to it and hearkens back to more exciting jazzy themes like the music from The Incredibles or superhero fare from the 1960s.

Ant-Man is Marvels formula coupled with genre-splicing, but its strengths come mostly from the unique spin that the character itself lends to the action. Go figure that even a superhero with a goofy premise can result in some oddly endearing entertainment.",1443225600,11,4656,4.609167671893848
7281925,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Hey, to each their own.... I've enjoyed pretty much all of the marvel superhero movies.  I've read all the original comics of the 60's and 70's, including Ant-Man, but he was never one of my favorites (Although I did thoroughly enjoy the Marvel Feature Ant-Man series from the 70's as well as Avengers 93 where Ant-Man traveled inside Vision). I always enjoyed Tales to Astonish as well.

But I do have to say, I think Ant-Man is my FAVORITE of all the Marvel movies.  I loved it!!!!  There is nothing negative I can say about it.  I even loved the music so much, I purchased the CD.  This is the first live action movie I took my 7 YO son to and he loves it, too!  For halloween, he's going as Ant-Man. When he grows up he wants to be a scientist.... his heroes are Tony Stark, Hank Pym, Edison and Einstein!!  Well, good luck... he has big shoes to fill.  But, I will be purchasing the Ant-Man movie when it comes out... hope to see a sequel!!  Who'd have thought... Ant-Man would be so good!!",1442793600,,995,4.301075268817204
7281926,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"I enjoyed this film. MARVEL succeeded in taking a lesser-known property and making it into an entertaining film.

I was excited for this premise simply because it wasn't like the other MARVEL movies. I strongly believe MARVEL is in a creative rut and continues to churn out superhero films with the exact same story, just different characters: larger than life enemy, all of Earth in trouble, insert infinity stone somewhere-- it's just become boring.

This movie took us in a different direction. Say what you will about Paul Rudd, but I found him to be likable in this role. Is he properly cast based on the comic book character? No clue. Haven't read it. But I did find myself rooting for him throughout.

The comedy in this was on par with other MARVEL films, same with the action. I would definitely be up for a sequel (which was hinted in the bonus scene. I liked it because it sets you up for great character development of one of the characters).

Just kidding. Fans. :P

All in all, it sounds stupid but it's a good enough in  this case.

He uses the ants to control and get superpowered to try and defeat those who want his powers. The enemy is one that actually is smart enough and has the recipe that his predecessor (the one with the suit) had created- the power is  too op. He realizes that he needs someone to help- cue Paul Rudd. In the end, he defeats em. Cuz Marvel :P

Thought the previews looked good and the full movie delivered.  Loved it! Nice blend of likable characters, humor and action. I find some of these action movies get a bit tedious after the first hour, but this one held my interest all the way through. As good as the initial Iron Man and Captain America movies, in my view, and I believe that to be high praise. Great origination story. The added element of the relationships between two fathers and their respective daughters that have distanced themselves from their fathers, for different reasons, make the fathers, the two male leads, Paul Rudd and Michael Douglas, that much more human. And I would say that this is as much a Michael Douglas movie as it is Paul Rudd's, which if fine with me. Plenty of special effects.

7281936,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"As the Marvel franchise has grown to epic proportions with it's unique and compelling take on superhero movies, some of the lesser known characters are starting to emerge and gain popularity, with Ant-Man possibly being the most unique of them all. I don't know how the story in the comic was, but I can tell you this, Ant-Man is the perfect character for the big screen. The special effects are nothing short of magic and take the concepts of Honey, I Shrunk The Kids to a whole other level. Scientist Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) created a new technology, one that was so dangerous, he buried the research deep in his company archives, but when his successor comes across it years later, he develops it, despite warning from Pym. In order to stop this from getting out, Pym recruits an unlikely hero to help him, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd). Lang is one of the best burglars around and Pym hopes to use these unique skills to get back his work. The only thing is the company's lab is impenetrable to all, except bugs. Using his prototype, Lang becomes Ant-Man and that is when this film really gets fun. Paul Rudd is absolutely terrific in this movie, as a small, nerdy, awkward guy, he can be hysterical under the right circumstances and this was just the perfect role for his personality. Rudd is paired with Michael Douglas, who 10 years ago wouldn't have even considered doing a film like this, showing just how powerful and influential the Marvel brand has become. Out of all the Marvel films to date this is perhaps the most interesting one. The cast is amazing, the special effects are outstanding, and I may never see Thomas The Train in the same way again. If you're like me, and not crazy about superheroes, don't let that stop you from seeing this film.

I would rank it pretty close to the top of the Marvel movies along with X-men Days of Futures Past as the best ones so far IMO.  Sooner or later Hollywood will tire of the entire superhero genre and move on, but this was definitely a good movie to see.

Ant Man reminded me a lot of the 1987 movie ""Innerspace"" with Dennis Quad and Martin short.  Especially the final battle scenes.  The movie was also similar to ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids"" with Rick Moranis with the big ant scenes.  Several scenes have been done before but Ant Man pulls them off with style.

7281938,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Ant-man, if you were to go by the tittle it appears pretty filmsy to incorporate a man the size of an ant and somehow make him appear as a superhero in a marvel film? They must be crazy! Yes they were, crazy enough to risk making a movie out of a long continuing lie of comic books which until now appealed only to the geeks. This movie takes it all away from the comic books, well structured and subtly surrounded by good humor plots here and there it keeps you entertained through its course of time. Its structured more into a heist movie with a good plot and the 'final battle' going down to the wire till the very end. In a particular moment Paul Rudd (Scott Lang) is made to run towards a door being full human size and made to pass through the key hole after having shrunk in due course of time and come out on the other side as a full scale man. The complexity with which you could do things like these are immense but at the same time when you grasp the idea that someone is capable enough to shrink back and forth, just imagine the horizons one can go to for just the fun of it. Thats what a lot of this movie is about, funny at the right moments, analytically logical and well explained (dont watch it if you question the mere existence of sci-fi movies). It marks a new evolution in Marvel's upcoming five years of release schedule and gives a underlying stress on how almost everything coming out later would have some sort of significant correlation. The timing of this movie is impeccable when you think about the movies which are to come out of the Marvel studios in significant years.

7281939,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"The Marvel cinematic universe has been around awhile, giving us epic films in a cohesive, connected world. Now that universe goes into a smaller direction with the release of Ant-Man, a film following two lead characters who have both worn the identity in the comics, and who, while very different in backgrounds, have some common ground. It's a lighter film with a good sense of humour that still plays to the strong characterization and history of the characters. Directed by Peyton Reed, who has a background in comedy, the film evokes the irreverent tone of last summer's Guardians Of The Galaxy while moving things into a very small scale indeed.

We first meet our hero Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), a thief with a tendency to break and enter and steal things- not quite your usual protagonist, but he's a charming sort of guy, and we get to like him regardless.

7281940,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Everybody I know of who has seen the movie told me, I wasn't expecting much but Ill go see it because I liked Antman as a child or because Marvel movies are generally good or because I like the Avengers or because I heard it was better than expected. I thought, well, the preview looks interesting, but not great. And honestly, Paul Rudd, as a Marvel hero? much less, an Avenger? Um, probably not. But, what the heck, so, a friend and I went to see the movie.

I will concede, the movie takes a while to get its steam up. Its like a Prius start. But Priuss can go fast once you get them going. Once this movie got going, I felt more like I was in a Lotus, like, great speed but also crazy cornering with lots of torque.

Seriously, Antman ROCKS!! I loved it. Better than all or each of the Iron Man movies. Honestly. It was like the dreams I would have when I fell asleep from reading old Avengers when I was a kid. Perfectly formed imagination world, like only a child can make. The kids in the movie loved it. There were several scenes where they all exploded into surprised exclamations: Mommy! what just happened to that man?! I could not help but smile.

This movie is paced immaculately, the fight scenes choreographed both cleverly (using the shrink/grow effect very imaginatively, illustrating the comic book so imaginatively, literally, like the the Antman action scenes from the comics sprung to life), little surprise details you forgot were coming, like some things I won't mention which are thrown around in a very small space, the comic relief at perfect moments and executed flawlessly, the cute scenes with his daughter (Cassie ie Abby Ryder Fortman), and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), were touching, clever, and cute. Flawless craftsmanship here. Nothing lacks, nothing overdone, nothing out of place. Is this the Hope Diamond of Marvel films?

Paul Rudd. Pulled it off soooo convincingly. Maybe that's part of the secret sauce for why this movie works so much. He's really pulls off the earnest and honest bit. Unlikely hero. 100% Avenger. I am glad to see other reviewers feel the same way. He nailed it, and will probably be who many young boys think of when they think of hero for years to come. Perfect casting.

This movie rates up there with other surprise winners for me, such as John Carter. Also excellent. Oh, yeh, also, Disney.

Now, a first for me, I went back to my John Carter review and found a line that applies equally to this movie: ""But I'm glad Disney did it because at the end I got that feeling you really only get when watching a well received Disney film.

I feel like a little boy again, reading the avengers all night, bought in a stack of 50 back issues from the comic store with chore money from working in the garden. That is exactly how I feel after watching this movie. Comic book crack.

Um, I'm not sure if anyone else is thinking this, but, Antman franchise? Sure, let him go off and play with the other Avengers, but, um, wow, bring him back in another movie of his own please. So much here to play with.

How did this happen? I'm confused. How was it so good. Elated but confused.

7281942,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Directed by Peyton Reed (Yes Man, The Break-Up), Ant-Man is a surprisingly fun film, and a better one than you'd expect from the trailers.  The screenplay had a number of contributors, from Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, The World's End) who was originally slated to direct, to Joe Cornish (Attack the Block) and Adam McKay (Anchorman, Step Brothers), and even Paul Rudd himself.

The film opens with a scene from 1989, when Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) abruptly resigns from SHIELD when he finds out that Howard Stark (John Slattery) has been attempting to replicate the shrinking technology that Pym had previously been using to be the Ant-Man. Technology that he had adamantly refused to share because of its dangerous potential. Cut to the present day when Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is being released from prison after having served time for a Robin Hood-esque cyber-crime he pulled involving millions of dollars. Lang is able to crash with a good-natured former cell-mate Luis (Michael Pea), but he's in desperate need of a job so he can pay child-support to his ex-wife Maggie (Judy Greer), without which he can't see his young daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson). After he gets fired from the only job he can land (""Baskin-Robbins _always_ finds out""), Lang reluctantly agrees to join in on a burglary job that Luis has for him.  Which turns out to be breaking into Hank Pym's mansion and cracking a safe he finds there. Which, it turns out, doesn't have large piles of cash or anything else of apparent value. Only a strange-looking bodysuit and an even stranger-looking helmet.  You can guess where this ultimately heads, and anything else I would say would be a spoiler.

There are a number of in-jokes in the film, some worked into the dialogue, some visual, and at least one that's auditory. But there is one that you might particularly want to watch for, a cameo by Garrett Morris who appears as a cab driver.  For those old enough to remember, Garrett Morris was part of the original Saturday Night Live cast, and in 1975 they did a superhero-based sketch where Garrett Morris played... you guessed it... Ant-Man. You can find it on youtube with ""Saturday Night Live superhero party"". And of course the immortal Stan Lee - the creator of Ant-Man and seemingly just about everything in the Marvel universe - has his usual cameo.

The special effects used for the shrinking/growing and ant scenes are adequate to the task but not particularly dazzling.  The 3D, as is all too common in 3D films, doesn't really add much to the film except in the scene where Lang and are seen making their way through a drain pipe.  All that said however, the reverse-aging CGI used to make Michael Douglas thirty years younger in the opening scene is pretty damn impressive. Seriously.  You have to see it to believe it.

The musical score by Christophe Beck (Frozen, Edge of Tomorrow) is suitably action-packed and goes well with what's going on on the screen, but otherwise isn't anything you'd particularly want to download.

Recommended for any fan of the Marvel universe and for anyone just looking for some good superhero fun.",1440115200,4,3126,4.833333333333333
7281943,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Ant-Man is awesome, reminiscent of the glory of the original Iron-Man film with its fantastic blend of intelligence, fun and adventure. All the familiar genre elements are there - superpowers, special effects, fate of the world, futuristic tech, bad guys, corny side characters  but this plot is pleasantly framed as more of a goofy caper than the usual action-fueled slug-fest. Its also hysterical, as Rudd brings his superb comedic timing to the material which showcases a plethora of smart visual gags too.

The shrinking effects are a blast, falling into two broad categories: some shots are positioned so that the characters puniness is emphasized as a tiny dot onscreen, others show the hero at a relatively normal size while the surrounding world is inflated to gigantic proportions. Either style is neat, fun and visually innovative. Once the battles begin, the filmmakers are always using the over-sized surroundings in very inventive and creative ways.

To criticize the film a little, the narrative has problems filling the gaps between plot points. So in between the significant moments are a variety of conversations where the same stakes and characterization are blandly repeated as needless reminders of the story. The girl really hates her dad, Ant-man really needs to redeem himself for his daughter, the bad guy is really bad  several of these scenes couldve been easily exorcised from the final runtime and helped the pace. Also, the villain is a a bit too much in his relentless psychopathy. This character is easily Marvels most sadistic and vicious despite being featured in their lightest and silliest film, and some of his shenanigans are too gruesome for the littlest viewers.

The naysayers have long cried comic-book fatigue and for the downfall of the genre. But for my money, Ant-man is the best of the Phase 2 movies and a great film to watch.",1440115200,,1873,5.068181818181818

Tbh, I wanted to watch this movie from the moment I saw the trailer, it looked cool and hilarious.
Was it cool and hilarious? No, it was Awesome and hilarious. I think I was smiling trough most of the movie, it was so much fun to watch and I can't wait to own it on DVD and watch it over and over.
I have not read any comics or anything for Ant-Man itself, so this is coming from a casual Marvel fan.
The acting was great, the ant scenes where great, the family scenes where great and the action was great. I also love how pretty much any age range can watch and enjoy this movie. I noticed a lot of people where turned off by the 'Ant-man' idea (including my dad, who I tried to get to go and watch the movie with me, he did not. But I will make him watch it on DVD for sure!) and it's sad because they are missing out on a really fun movie.
I really hope they make a 2.

7281947,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Director: Payton Reed

Screenwriters: Edgar Wright, Joe Cornish, Adam McKay, and Paul Rudd

Cast: Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Corey Stoll, Evangeline Lilly, and Bobby Cannavale

Na-na na-na na-na na-na ANT-MAN?  You read that right.  Stan Lees 1962 comic book character, Ant-Man gets the Marvel cinematic treatment with Paul Rudd as the microscopic maverick.  This film concludes Marvels Phase Two that started with Iron Man 3 back in 2013.  Rumblings of an Ant-Man movie date back at least fifteen years when radio personality Howard Stern claimed that he tried to buy the rights to the character.  By 2003, British director Edgar Wright pitched an Ant-Man film to Marvel that was in perpetual development for eleven years before creative differences between Wright and Marvels parent company Disney eventually resulted in Wrights departure.  Director Payton Reed would step in to finish the project, and while production was troubled and buzz was non-existent, Ant-Man, like its namesake, is stronger than it looks.

As I mentioned, Paul Rudd plays Ant-Man and his alter ego, Scott Lang.  Rudd also serves as a co-screenwriter on the film, making him the first star of a Marvel film to serve as both lead actor and screenwriter.  The film opens in 1989 where a furious Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) argues in front of S.H.I.E.L.D. (including Agent Peggy Carter, played by Hayley Atwell) that his breakthrough on reducing the distance between atoms, nicknamed the Pym Particle, is too dangerous to hand over to them.  Fast forward 26 years and Pym has been effectively voted out of control of his own company by his own apprentice, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll).  Cross has been working on recreating the Pym Particle and appears to be on the cusp of doing so, the consequences of which worry Pym.

Cross is a bad dude, and if you weren't suretheres a scene where he evaporates a cute, little lamb in his testing trials to shrink organic matter. But this film is not called Lamb Man, so Ill move on.

It turns out Lang, an electrical engineer, caught the attention of Pym when he was arrested for burgling his employer, a cyber-security conglomerate, because they were overcharging their customers.  After serving three years in San Quentin, Lang was released and Pym, in a rather unorthodox[*] fashion, recruits Lang to wear a secret particle suit that would allow him to shrink to the size of an ant in a plot to overthrow Cross.

Langs place in the conflict between Pym and Cross does seem artificial at first.  Enter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson), Langs six-year-old daughter.  Langs main motivation is to be a man Cassie can be proud of, and Pym is offering him a chance to do just that.  It also doesnt hurt that Pyms beautiful daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) is assigned to work closely with Lang in his training.

And there is a lot of training.  Not only does the Ant-Man suit allow Lang to shrink in size, but he retains human strength in his miniature form.  Pym also provides Lang with a neurotransmitter that allows him to communicate with actual ants making him the weirdest movie superhero to date, in my opinion.

However, weirdness works in the case of Ant-Man, mostly because of Paul Rudd.  Rudd has been slowly breaking out over the past 20 years.  His everyman approach and his bravado sense of humor make him impossible not to root for, which is precisely why he is effective as a superhero.  Like all of the best Marvel films, this one is not just a superhero film, but it is a genre film as well.  Ant-Man plays out like a caper, complete with safe cracking, data stealing, and elaborate breaking and entering schemes.  Theres even a sort of Oceans 11 vibe when Lang recruits has band of misfits including Michael Pea, David Dastmalchian, and T.I. to help with a big heist.

On a surprising note, I was underwhelmed by how mediocre the effects seemed in this film.  I saw Ant-Man in the traditional 2-D format, and some of the scenes where a shrunken Ant-Man navigates his miniature world echoed far too closely to Honey I Shrunk the Kids than should be the case in this post-Avatar day of computer effects.  Most of these effects were clearly staged and shot for 3-D, but they do seem clunky in the 2-D form.  Fortunately for Ant-Man, the script is fun with plenty of action and enjoyable dialogue.  The film is also woven nicely into the Marvel Cinematic Universe thanks to a fun scene between Ant-Man and a special Avenger cameo (On your left!). The crown for the goofiest Marvel movie that once sat on the head of Thor: The Dark World only to be claimed by Guardians of the Galaxy now firmly sits atop Ant-Man, but that continues to not be a bad thing!  B+

Ant-Man is rated PG-13 and has a running time of 1 hour and 57 minutes.  Unlike Avengers: Age of Ultron, this film does have additional scenes after the film.  There is one about a minute into the credits and another after the credits.

[*] I sat and pondered how to write a plot summary for this film for over twenty minutes.  I considered adding the detail about how Lang cant find a job because of his criminal record, so he and his friend Luis (Michael Pea) plan another robbery, which turns out to be Pyms house, which is how Lang first comes in contact with the Ant Man suit, which wouldnt be that strange except that Pym had orchestrated the robbery anyway from the start!

7281949,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Step number one in watching Marvel's Ant-Man is NOT to take it very seriously. The actors and filmmakers didn't and thats what works about this movie. Definitely the most comical of all the Marvel flicks thus far, Ant-Man is an enjoyable and lighthearted film that has a place in Marvel's Cinematic Universe but without any real consequences, yet.

It's difficult to make a story about a man that can shrink to the size of an ant, dark or mysterious, so knowing that the studio set out to make a movie that would bring in another one of their characters with a unique and useful skill-set that doesn't have a particularly incredible or original storyline. Paul Rudd was a good cast for the titular role and brings a nice blend of his comedy as well as some solid acting when needed.

7281950,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"I had first heard of Ant Man while driving up the freeway, when a large billboard caught my eye. It was advertising Marvels latest creation: Ant Man.  Now I reacted the same way as many of you probably did, An Ant Man? How strange. What kind of powers could he possibly have? I didn't really want to pay the $10 to find out.

But on a dull Wednesday in the middle of July, my friend and I with nothing to do, he proposed the idea of going to a movie. The choices: Ant Man or Minions. My friend not being one for small, one-eyed, little yellow monsters, the decision was unanimous. We were going to see Ant Man. And just a few minutes into the movie, I could tell it was going to be better than I ever imagined.

It was incredible! We raved about our favorite characters, scenes, and lines the whole way home. I couldn't wait to tell everyone that Ant Man is one to see. From conducting a burglary with his guys, to a fist-to-fist brawl with the malicious and powerful Ultron, Ant Man shrunk in size, but grew to be one of my favorite superheroes.

I would recommend Ant Man to anyone who enjoys action, comedy, romance, science fiction, or all of the above! This film combines all of these entertaining genres to create one heck of a movie.

Scott Lang, the newly found Ant Man, was a con artist. Divorced with one loving daughter, he is determined to set himself straight, but is constantly pulled back into crime with the help of his three co-conspirators, Luis, Kurt, and Dave. Together, they pull off a heist which changes their lives, mainly Langs, in many unexpected ways.

When he opens the vault expecting riches, only to find a mysterious (but cool looking) suit, Lang is perplexed and wants to find out more. And sure enough, he does when his mentor Hank Pym, founder of multibillion dollar company Pymtech, invites him to wear the suit and become the Ant Man.

 Why? In order to save the world from the hands of Darren Cross, new head of Pymtech, who wants to create an army of small bots using the technology behind the Ant Suit and ultimately change modern day warfare into a scene of even more havoc and destruction. The fate of everyone was in Langs hands.

Through much training time spent with Hank, and his cunning daughter Hope, Scott and the team prepare for the biggest heist of their lives: To infiltrate the highly guarded Pymtech Headquarters and prevent Cross from carrying out with his crazed plan.  It was a ride that had me laughing my head off, and also hanging on the edge of my seat for dear life.

All in all, Ant Man is not just any ordinary Marvel movie, it is much more than that.  I definitely recommend it to kids and adults of all ages.",1439337600,3,2674,4.423625254582484

7281952,3,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Marvel may look as if it runs like a well-oiled machine, but on occasion an army of ants have spoiled the picnic. Marvel's Ant-Man has been developing around the offices since before 2008's Iron Man, with fan-favorite director Edgar Wright having spent the most time working on the diminutive Avenger's story. But the Marvel Universe grew in that time into a Hollywood-dominating behemoth, and Wright's quirky, standalone vision no longer fit. In came Peyton Reed as director, followed by universe-connecting rewrites from Adam McKay and star Paul Rudd. It may sound like a messy situation and possibly Marvel's first dud, but Ant-Man turns out to be a funny and offbeat heist film that stands up well to last year's Guardians of the Galaxy.

Who knows where Wrights' story ends and McKay/Rudd's begins, but chances are the weirdness belongs to the former while the jokey Avengers cameos (which won't be spoiled here) to the latter. It makes for an interesting hybrid of styles, bringing a little bit of Mission: Impossible to the Marvel Universe for the first time. Rudd plays Scott Lang, a petty thief with an ex-wife (Judy Greer) who has moved on to another man (Bobby Cannavale), taking Lang's daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson) with her. Freshly released from prison and ready to keep clean, Lang discovers that nobody wants to hire an ex-con. Not even Baskin-Robbins. So he hooks up with a trio of fellow crooks (Michael Pena, T.I., David Dastmalchian) for an easy job busting into some old rich guy's safe. What he finds inside isn't what he expected...it's some kind of suit.

Basically there are two major narratives at play in Ant-Man, and both have to do with fathers redeeming themselves in the eyes of their daughters. The suit belongs to inventor Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), who created a formula called ""Pym Particles"" that allowed him to shrink in size while packing a superhuman punch. SHIELD wanted the formula for themselves, but fearing it would be used for nefarious purposes, Pym hid the formula and quietly retired, leaving his company in the dubious hands of former protge Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) who has created a version of Pym Particles for himself. Fearing the worst, Pym teams up with his estranged daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) to recruit Lang for a not-so-simple job: use the Ant-Man suit to bust into Cross' lab and ruin his plans.

Ant-Man fits neatly into the overall Marvel formula, even though it follows the beats of a traditional heist movie, only with superpowers, six-legged bugs, and Rudd's natural charm. The film is undeniably goofy, perhaps the silliest Marvel movie yet, and for that reason one never feels like the stakes are too high. But it fits the overall tone which is bouncy and geared toward kids who will probably love his insect sidekicks. They'll also get a kick out of the final battle, a visually inventive throwdown in which Reed skillfully plays with perspective. When the camera pulls back from the tiny fight to show how it looks to normal eyes, the result is often hilarious, especially in one sequence involving a Thomas the Tank Engine toy. While modest compared to some of the larger-budgeted Marvel films, there are still a number of striking images. A mind-warping trek into the Microverse is especially impressive, and it's undeniably cool whenever Lang is flying alongside his insect pals. Reed, who directed comedies like Bring It On and Down with Love, has a good handle on the unorthodox tone.

As a character, Lang is perhaps the least interesting lead Marvel hero. It has nothing to do with Rudd, who adapts to the film's strangeness like a champ and nails the earnest, emotional bits just as well. It has to do with Lang not being especially developed as a hero, and that he's somewhat muted compared to the characters around him. He's already got three bumbling buddies, a stern female love interest and one anguished mentor vying for screen time. Lang's dominant personality trait is that he's well-meaning, which isn't particularly engrossing. Douglas brings his veteran heft to the role of Pym, and he scores some strong heart-tugging scenes with both Rudd and Lilly. Stoll unfortunately was saddled with one of those forgettable tech-baddie characters, the kind we'll never see again like Jeff Bridges and Sam Rockwell in Iron Mans 1 & 2. Remember them? If there's a standout it's Pena as Lang's over-eager, excitable cohort. Somebody get that guy a super powered suit, STAT. Maybe he can be Ant Machine?

Despite a forced attempt by Marvel to fit Ant-Man into the larger Avengers universe, the film still feels like a somewhat disconnected piece of the puzzle. That's not necessarily a bad thing as it allows a certain degree of creative freedom. While hardly the most astonishing of tales, Ant-Man is a gratifying story that has stolen a unique spot in the Marvel Universe.",1439078400,7,4864,4.94859241126071
7281953,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"If you head over to IMDB and check all the reviews for this movie, youd see that literally every review has around 50% down votes. I think people are mostly divided on their views for this movie; some people complained about the fighting scenes while others complimented the CGI and vice versa. I was hesitant to go see it after reading the reviews, but I shoved all those negative thoughts out of my head and went regardless.

Im really glad that I went. I wasn't a huge fan of Marvel and DC superheroes at first  Im more of an anime/manga lover, but over the years all these superhero movies grew on me and Ive since caught up on all of them. I went into this movie knowing basically nothing about the background of Ant-Man and I followed along with the plot just fine. The movie describes Ant-mans humble beginnings very well and Im sure that kids of all ages will be able to follow along with the plot just fine.

This movie is meant for people of all ages, but if you ask me, I think its leaning just a little bit towards the younger generation. If I remember correctly (its been awhile since Ive last seen the movie), I don't think there were any nudity or sex scenes. The jokes definitely feel like Marvel jokes; light-hearted, fast pace, quick-wit, and really capitalizing on cool moments. The supporting casts were great as well; Michael Pena tried way too hard to be funny, but it still came out alright. Evangeline Lilly played Hope PERFECTLY. I really like her in this role and Im glad they are initiating her into the marvel universe.

I personally thought that the action scenes and CGI were phenomenal. People underestimate how hard it is to make a unique character such as Ant-Man work on the big screen and I think they did a fantastic job. The fight scenes are very innovative, his transformations during the fights opens up a lot of possibility and brings variety to the table.

In conclusion, if you are the type of person that really likes the Marvel movie franchises, then I think you should give this movie a chance. I really liked it and Im sure most of you will too",1438992000,,2090,4.489473684210527
7281954,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"So I watched this one in the theaters tonight. I have to say, I was rather expecting a cheese fest with this one, but I was very pleasantly surprised by how beautifully the story was handled. It's a good movie.

Just because of the nature of Ant-man, there are bound to be some laughs. I mean, how can you really take the movie 100% seriously when the guy commands a bunch of ants and becomes tiny at will. That said, its filmed in a way where, that's ok. It doesn't take itself too seriously either, so there are points where they clearly encourage a little bit of poking fun at the absurdity of a couple things--like having an epic battle that's tiny sized and watching the toy train fall anticlimactically off the tracks at a distance.  I also love that the Ant-man they picked for this series is one that doesn't take himself too seriously either. There are a few running gags throughout, which will definitely give a few good laughs.
Despite all the humor, though, there is clearly something huge at steak, and there are more than a few very serious moments. I will also mention that his great control of the suit makes it fun to watch him fight with it on. Even beyond everything that happens in Ant-man, there are a couple bold dips into the more every-day happenings of the Avengers, as well as a confrontation with one you met in Winter Soldier that will likely get you grinning from ear to ear. I will say, its nice that there seems to be some sort of purpose behind this detour, but I want to see more of the reason behind why he went there. There was very little said on the item that he took, but I assume we'll see it again in the future. All in all, I loved this movie.

SPOILERS:

You can read all these great reviews here, so I will keep this short and sweet!.

This was a joy to watch, innovative, with just the right blend of action, tension, family, incredible special effects, etc.  Michael Douglas was fantastic as always, Paul Rudd took a strange role in a genre he is not used to and made it his own.  Michael Pena was brilliant, and added some excellent comedic timing, with the lip syncing bits practically stealing the show.  And Evangeline Lily, you simply have to appreciate for the ability to portray a strong, sexy woman who can hold her own, can still show some emotion, and all without relying on tactics like butt shots and thigh high slit skirts.

Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is released from San Quentin and desperately tries to find a job, any job, that will earn him some money and allow him to earn visitation rights to see his young daughter, Cassie (Abby Ryder Portson, who is almost too cutesy-pie) who lives with her mom (Judy Greer) and step-dad, Paxton (Bobby Cannavale), a cop who doesn't trust Scott. Scott is desperately trying to go straight, but soon decides he has to revert to his old cat-burglar ways. Meanwhile, Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) spent years developing a serum that would shrink humans, and give them extra strength, much like an ant. But he quickly realizes how this technology could land in the wrong hands and buries the invention. Years later, he realizes his protege, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), who now runs the company, is very close to the same invention. But Cross doesn't have the conscience of his mentor and is willing to sell the technology to the evil folks at Hydra. He has even developed a suit called ""Yellow Jacket"". Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), Pym's slightly estranged daughter now works for Cross, trying to earn the achievements her father denied her all his life. Pym sets his eyes on Scott and enlists the con's help to stop Cross.

""Ant-Man"" was originally set to be directed by Edgar Wright (""Shaun of the Dead"", ""Hot Fuzz""). Then, Wright stepped away and Peyton Reed (""Bring It On"", ""The Break-up"", ""Yes Man"") took over. This is a pretty seismic shift and each brings a very different tone to the project. Quite frankly, I am surprised that ""Ant-Man"" is so good. Reed is the director behind one of my least favorite films of all time (""The Break-Up"" starring Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston) and his work doesn't have the originality or take the chances that Wright's does. I think Wright's influence is still present - he is one of the writers listed. Reed does a good job of keeping the story moving, while developing the characters and story. More on his work later.

Paul Rudd is an unexpected choice to headline a Marvel film, but here he proves to be the perfect choice for the character. When he is presented with Pym's idea, his reaction is pure Rudd and his comedic influence is evident throughout the film. Scott is sarcastic, funny and desperate to get his life going again. Rudd, who also worked on the screenplay with frequent collaborator Adam McKay (who has worked on most of Will Ferrell's movies as writer and/or director) has tailored the character to his persona. It is a nice fit, giving Rudd the chance to push the boundaries of anything he has done before.

We first meet Scott in prison, which is a bit of a shock, but we quickly learn he was convicted of burglary. Upon his release, he gets a job, providing some laughs which help to set the tone for the rest of the film. A continued exchange about the employer is the influence of Rudd and is something you see in most of his films. When he eventually meets Pym and Hope, his skepticism initially prevents him from embracing the idea. After some work, Pym and his daughter manage to convince Scott that they need his help.

Douglas is very good as Pym, a man who has spent his entire life pursuing one invention. When he realizes the negative implications, he retreats only to be coaxed back into the spotlight when he realizes Cross has come too close to the same discovery. He knows his protege is dangerous and that he has to do something  he planted the idea in Cross' head, so he is responsible. There is a lot of history in his performance, something that may sound strange, but we are first introduced to Pym twenty-five years before the main story begins. When we meet him in present day, he has suppressed a lot in his life and this tends to make him grumpy, short and exasperated. He is a smart man, and a lot of his plans work to a T. But when an unexpected thing happens, he tends to take out his frustrations on Scott or Hope, whether they deserve them or not.

A lot of his frustrations also seem to come from being a scientist who realizes his life work is about to be used for the wrong purpose, an evil purpose, leading him to bury the creation, to hide it, to step away.

This act also leads to problems with two other characters.

Evangeline Lilly, best known for ""Lost"", plays Hope, Pym's estranged daughter. Continuing to work at the company her father created, she is seeking something, anything to help her step out of his shadow. She is also bitter because her mom died in strange circumstances, when she was young. Her father's vague explanations lead her to suspect him of some involvement. Working with his former protege, she feels she will finally be able to help create something important, something to earn her credit. For many years under her father's shadow, her frustrations with him and his self-enforced distance have estranged them.

Pym's former assistant, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll, TV's ""The Strain"", ""Midnight in Paris"") realizes the potential of the company and is disappointed his brilliant teacher is unwilling to explore the invention. Eventually, he takes over the company, developing technology of his own to rival that of his former boss. Throughout their lives, Pym seems to have tried to contain Cross, keeping his ambitions in check. This merely serves to frustrate him, spurring him to work harder, faster and to look for new technologies. Cross starts to get closer to his own discovery of a similar serum, and quickly makes his plans known to Pym, horrifying his former mentor. All the years of working towards this goal have taken a toll on Cross' sanity.

Bobby Cannavale plays a cop, the new husband of Scott's ex-wife, who is instantly suspicious of everything the released burglar is doing. Wood Harris (best known for ""The Wire"") plays his partner. For a large part of the film, they are relegated to the background, becoming a bit of comic relief, providing a slight, constant irritation to Scott and his team.

When Scott is released from prison, Luis (Miguel Pena) is there to pick him up. A former cell mate, he is ready and eager for Scott to join his crew and return to his criminal past. Luis' disappointment that Scott wants to go straight is easy to spot, but their prison bond is strong and Luis is still happy for his friend's company.

Pena's Luis is possibly the funniest character in the film. His character is cleverly worked into the narrative leading to a few really hilarious moments. And his unbridled enthusiasm is almost infectious, making him fun and a lot more interesting than the other two members of the crew.

There are two other members of Luis' crew, who take part in the narrative, but they are pretty much stock characters who pale in comparison to Luis and pretty forgettable.

Reed seems to be having a good time, using a much more deft hand than I have ever seen in his previous films, mixing the comedy, drama, action and special effects. When we first meet Scott, he seems like a typical ex-con, maybe not someone who should be in San Quentin, but pretty typical nonetheless. Reed and Rudd work quickly to establish that Scott is trying to go down a different path. When Scott eventually decides to help Pym and Hope, there is an extensive bit of training, and this helps to show us the lengths he has to go to in order to prepare for his upcoming battle with Yellow Jacket.

I feel there is a small, but significant misstep in the finale, which takes the end game from something more dangerous to something more intimate for only Scott. In a way, this is welcome. Most of the Marvel films contain finales that are too big, meant to save thousands of lives, entire cities, etc. Because this fight is more personal, it makes this film stand out a little more for me. It's not as Marvel as other Marvel films. And the location does make sense, bringing a sense of danger into Scott's personal life. But the location is also a hindrance. I'm officially conflicted. And NO SPOILERS! Hooray!

""Ant-Man"" is unique enough in the Marvel universe to make him stand out, which is very welcome. I was ultimately more bored by ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" because it all seemed so familiar. In ""Ant-Man"", a lot of elements seem fresh and unusual and hold my interest.

As this film is part of the Marvel universe, there are two post-credits sequences. Stay through the very end of the credits (yes, all the special effects technicians and music credits) for the second, cryptic scene.",1438819200,,8726,4.666232921275212

7281958,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Dr. Hank Pym was a scientist back in the 1980s who discovered the Pym Particles which he used to power a super-suit. S.H.I.E.L.D. wanted to buy his technology but he refused to sell. After this brief introduction, the movie jumps to the present day where Scott Lang is let out of prison after serving three years for a white-collar crime. He wants to go on the straight and narrow so he can see his daughter, but his ride from prison is not her mother--it's his ex-cell mate. The cell mate lives in a sketchy San Francisco neighborhood and has sketchy friends as well. Scott moves in temporarily till he can get back on his feet. Scott tries to get a decent job but can only get one by lying about his criminal record. That soon comes out and he considers pulling a heist with the guys. A friend of a friend of a friend let the cell mate know that a rich man's safe will be left unguarded while the man is out of town. They plan a heist that gets them into the safe, but the only thing inside is a crazy suit and jars of liquid. No money or valuables! Scott takes the suit anyway, then tries it on. He pushes a button and BAM! he's shrunk to the size of an ant. A voice starts talking in his head, encouraging him and providing guidance. Scott breaks back into the man's house to return the suit only to get busted by the cops. While in holding, a much older Hank Pym visits him and offers him a job--use the suit to rob Pym Technologies because his 1980s research is about to become public in a bad way. Another heist is in the works.

The movie has an amazing blend of drama and comedy that somehow works so well. Marvel has the sense to make movies with human drama and the triumph of good over evil without feeling dark, cliched, or unoriginal. Scott's problems as a dad separated from his daughter could have been painfully obvious and cliched, but they don't go there. The daughter still loves him; the mom isn't rabidly opposed to him as a dad but she recognizes he needs to straighten his life out before he can be a father to his daughter. The mom is dating a cop which makes for some awkwardness all around, especially when he arrests him while returning the suit. The humor works well and fits the story naturally. Some moments border on the overly melodramatic but are scaled back with a little humor.

Marvel has done a great job making genre movies out of their superhero movies. Captain America: The First Avenger was a period film/World War II film. Iron-Man was a classic redemption story. Captain America: The Winter Soldier was a 1970s-style political thriller. Ant-Man gives us a comedy heist film with superheroes. I hope they keep up the good tradition.

This is great popcorn fun and well worth seeing on the big screen since the hero gets so tiny. We saw this in 2D and usually I notice a scene or two that look specifically designed to be seen in 3D but I didn't notice any in this film. So don't bother seeing it in 3D.",1438732800,,2945,4.360655737704918
7281959,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"I went into this movie with my lowest expectations for a Marvel Cinema film. This is the smallest budget ($134M, 600k less than ""the Incredible Hulk"") for a Marvel Cinema movie yet. I've never been a fan of Ant-man either. Then, when Edgar Wright left production, my concerns mounted. Would his replacement, Peyton Reed, the guy who directed ""Bring It On"", be able to do a Marvel movie?

Similar to Guardians of the Galaxy, pundits kept asking if this would be Marvel's first flop. Why isn't there the same pessimism with Pixar? Marvel is averaging 773M per film. Marvel continues to invigorate and diversify the genre. Winter Soldier had nearly as much in common with Bourne Trilogy as it did with Avengers. Guardians was a sarcastic mash-up of Con-Air, Magnificient Seven and Star Wars.

Ant-man combines Iron Man themes with Ocean's Eleven and adds its own personality to the mix. We now have a new sub-genre. Just as Guardians is ""Super-Hero, Space Opera"" and Winter Soldier is ""Super-Hero, Spy Thriller"", now we have ""Super-Hero, Buddy Heist"".

Marvel continues to get top-notch performances for their films. Paul Rudd impresses as Scott Lang, the apprentice to the long-retired Hank Pym, played by Michael Douglass. After watching the trailers, I was concerned that Douglass and Rudd would make the hero too tongue-in-cheek, but the film took the Ant-man uniform much more seriously. Michael Pena even comments on how cool the suit looks when he first sees it. Pena nearly steals the show playing Luis, Scott Lang's cellmate in San Quentin. Luis has his own buddies, Dave (Tip ""T.I."" Harris) and Kurt (Dave Dastmalchian). They each have skills but seem to have bad luck in their burglaries.

Evangeline Lilly is superb as Hope Van Dyne. She thought about dropping out of the film after Wright left, until she read the script revisions. I'm looking forward to seeing her in future films. She has power on the screen, delivering great action scenes as always.

Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) was a bit stereotypical as the aggrieved protege of Hank Pym. What has made Marvel successful all these years are great villains. Yellowjacket was probably one of the worst villains yet, right up there with Justin Hammer.

The movie had great timing for its light-hearted moments and didn't create a comedy out of the material. The punchlines serve to break dramatic tension and are used to great effect to keep the movie from dragging in its own wake.

One of the big highlights is when Ant-man takes on an Avenger. Again, this could've easily descended into camp, but the actors and director keep the action and dialog up at blockbuster levels.

As with Iron Man, Marvel has this innate ability to make the unreal seem believable. They make a C-list hero seem as cool as possible with abilities done in a way that actually don't seem like a curse.

Comparisons to the other movies are inevitable, but this movie is unique in the Marvel Cinema catalog. I would rank it in the middle of the pack.",1438732800,,2988,4.854616895874264

7281961,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"So far, 2015 has been a pretty disappointing year for blockbusters. The recent entries to the Jurassic Park, Terminator and, yes, Avengers franchises have all had at least somewhat mixed reactions, and rightfully so. But along comes Ant-Man, a lesser-known character in the Marvel universe, and stars in the most entertaining movie of the summer and, what's more, a well-deserved addition to the Marvel saga.

Paul Rudd is excellently cast as Scott Lang, a cat burglar who longs to turn a new page so that he can be with his daughter. Just as he realizes that society isn't intent on giving him a chance, along comes someone who is - Hank Pym, who has invented a method of scaling a human being down in size while simultaneously increasing their strength. This technology has fallen into bad hands in his company, in particular the hands of maniacal CEO Darren Cross, whose shady intentions with the technology are plain. Thus, Pym and his estranged daughter work to put Scott up to a heist where he destroys all copies of the technology, with the help of the most undetectable partners imaginable - ants.

I can't imagine anyone but Paul Rudd pulling off Scott. He's got the comedy and humanity of the character down to a tilt, but he's frequently upstaged by his loudmouth friend and ex-cellmate, Luis, a theater-roaringly hilarious performance by Michael Pea. Ant-Man is fun across the board, exciting and plays with its themes of a man in a supersized world in consistently inventive ways. It strikes the balance between the themes of fun, action and serious that Age of Ultron so missed.

If you're a Marvel fan, you owe yourself not to miss Ant-Man. It's more than a worthy addition to the Marvel roster, and one of the most entertaining movies of the year.

7281962,3,B00ZGDIGZ2,"There is no end to Marvel Comics' characters, some more successful than others. This PG-13 actioner is unique in a very special way and its crossover plan is firmly in place by the final (final, final) curtain. Of course the movie consists of a steady stream of special effects, hung on a fairly flimsy story punctuated by Daddy Issues, but I LIKE Paul Rudd, and the ""Avengers"" link is fun. (You have to watch for it, I'm not telling...smile...)

Director Peyton Reed (Lots of TV) has all he needs to make a blockbuster. My impression was that he cooked up a cinematic Chinese dinner: Tasty, but it didn't stick to my ribs. Instead, to my delight I found much of my attention focused on the humor to be found in our hero's ""support"" team.

The cast:
  * Paul Rudd (""Parks and Recreation"") Con-man Scott Lang becomes Ant-Man in an unusual way...well, maybe not for a Marvel character...but... His first official job as Ant-Man is to burgle Tony Stark's warehouse. I liked the back story about his crime that landed him in prison in the first place.
  * Michael Douglas (""Beyond the Candelabra"") Dr. Hank Pym is either evil or brilliant depending on how his Ant-Man suit is used. He still grieves the loss of his wife and fears for his daughter's future.
  * Evangeline Lilly (""The Hobbit"") Hope van Dyne seems to be confronting her father with her choice of profession.
  * Corey Stoll (""The Good Lie"") Darren Cross is a former colleague of Dr. Pym's. His creation, Yellowjacket, is a villain to (try to) avoid!
  * Michael Pea (""The Martian"") Pea almost steals this movie. To me, Luis is the most consistently funny character on the screen and Director Reed uses him extremely well.
  * T.I. (""Get Hard"") Dave is one of Lang's accomplices. He too, is very funny as a would-be thief and Luis wouldn't be as funny without Dave to help: ""back up...back up...back up...""
  * Judy Greer (""Archer"") Maggie Lang took her little girl Cassie and has moved on with her life after her husband went to prison. Cassie misses him, though.
  * Bobby Cannavale (""Danny Collins"") Paxton is a flummoxed cop determined to put Lang back in jail.
  * Garrett Morris (""Two Broke Girls"") This cabdriver doesn't have much to do, but I wanted to acknowledge Mr. Morris's very long, very productive career.

The Computer Generated Imaging is so overwhelming during the many action scenes, I was rarely sure what was going on; however, watch for the unique lip sync scenes when Luis relates what just happened. Even Stan Lee gets in on the act as a bartender! We always watch for him!

Expect non-stop action, a chaste kiss and no nudity or F-bombs, but lots and lots of gunfire, fisticuffs and special effects. Whew! Remember, this is a Marvel movie but this time wait for TWO little teasers during and after the closing credits scroll.

7281966,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"I watched Ant-Man on the day it came out, but it is only now that I have time to review it. This is a heist movie taking place after Avengers: Age of Ultron concerning the Pym Particle technology for shrinking things. I will examine Plot, Character, and Polish and then assign a grade.

PLOT

First of all, I want to dispel any misconception that this movie is a re-tread of Ironman. While it looks similar due to both the hero and his evil counterpart wearing powered armor and the conflict is over the armor's proper use there are numerous differences. The most important of which is that this movie is a heist movie. It revolves around a plan to steal the prototype Yellow Jacket armor from Daren Cross and delete all the data on it so another cannot be built. The second is that Daren Cross is a legitimate creator of the Yellow Jacket; Hank Pym refused to tell him the formula or even confirm that it was a real thing and not just a hoax, so he reinvented it. The roles of Iron Man and Iron Monger are then, in part, the opposite in this film. A third point is the difference in cast but that will be in the CHARACTERS section.

I like the plot because I think it is has a sound foundation and build up. The Evil Plan is established, Scott is recruited, trained to stop it, the plan develops and then the heist is carried out.
Personal conflicts and arcs are wrapped around this basic structure to flesh it out and give it meat. It can be both silly (""Baskin Robins Always Finds Out"")  and profound (The speech about second chances).

The ending is satisfying. It closes the conflict of this movie while pointing to new adventures for Ant-Man in future MCU projects.

CHARACTERS

Scott Lang is about as far away from Tony Stark as one can get. He's much closer to Average Joe than the ""genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist"" in both his everyday demeanor and the world that he inhabits, which includes roommates and annoying retail jobs. The only reason he's included in Hank Pym's plan, is because he is both trust worthy and expendable. In fact, I'd say he has more in common with Steve Rogers.

This is what made him so engaging and interesting as a character. Scott Lang is truly a hero for the little guy. He's not a famous war hero, a (demi) god, enormous green rage monster, a super spy, etc. He's just a guy suit and he didn't even make the suit.  What he is underneath the suit is just as heroic as anyone else in the MCU.  Enough comparisons with other heroes; Scott stands on his own without them.

He is quite the devoted father. It's clear that his daughter Cassie means the world to him. All of their scenes are adorable. He has a streak of self-deprecating humor that is shown most prominently during his scene with Falcon. For a third point, he's a modern day Robin Hood.

Hank Pym is a grouchy old man but it's easy to see the rusted heroism inside of him. He plays a Big Good role in this film directing and training Scott. His dynamic with his two apprentices has Star Wars overtones (the bad original one and the good new one), which is cool.

Luis, Kurt, and Dave, ""The Three Woombats"", are great for comedy, but they are also more than just fun guys. They're skilled at what they do and, aside from their (off-screen) petty crimes, heroic in and of themselves.

Darren Cross makes for a great mix of hamminess and villainy while also distinct from other MCU villains. He has this Well Done Son Guy complex with Hank, but at the same time, it's more of a Surpassed The Teacher sort of thing. His offhand comment about ""morning meditations"" also sticks out.

Hope Van Dyke is an interesting character because, as she points out, she is far better suited for to be The Hero of this story than Scott. She works at the place, she knows the technology, she has Cross's trust, and she knows ""how to punch"".  This leads to a More Hero Than Thou with her father for the first half of the film. Scott takes the role not because he's better qualified, as would be the case in another film, but because he is expendable.
She's not a love interest. The make out with Scott at the end occurs off screen and so quickly that it's more a joke than honest romance or ship tease. Her reconciliation with her father is by far the more important relationship in terms of emotional content (just like how Scott's relationship with his own daughter is more important to him).  However, if there's an Ant-Man II, I imagine that this will change because there's a Generational Xerox thing going on with Ant-Man and Wasp.

POLISH

As has become standard with Marvel Studios, this movie looks fantastic. It has smooth pacing, it has great special effects, and hilarious jokes.

7281967,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Ant-Man is not your typical hero. He starts off as a criminal (with good intentions) and ends up as a Super Hero wearing the Ant-Man suit, which shrinks him down to the size of an insect. But even as a tiny ant, Paul Rudd gives us a role filled with character and heart, combined with the great dead pan comedy delivery of Michael Douglas, with the strong woman portrayal of Evangeline Lily as his daughter and potential romance interest for Ant Man. Trouble starts when the main villain, played by Cory Stoll, finally unveils the secret to micronization, the ability to shrink down or expand at will. Posing a great threat with plans for a massive army of Yellow Jacket army suits, it's up to Ant-Man and his team of comical side kicks to save the day. Lots of dry comedy keeps the film a joy to watch while also poking fun at the imaginative concept at the same time.
The 3D in Ant-Man takes you down to the micro size and intensifies the effects tenfold.

7281969,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"The last superhero movies I saw were the first two Spider-Man movies and Batman Begins.  I'm quite ""behind the times"", you could say.  As a whole, my impressions of recent superhero movies are that they dehumanize the struggle with too much destruction and are too self-consciously dark, as if trying to make me/the audience feel the magnitude of their struggle more.  Something about the Ant-Man trailer awakened curiosity and made me think this was going to be different than those really dark superhero movies by Christopher Nolan or those ""group"" movies like Avengers, X-Men, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Fantastic Four (none of which I've watched), and that the Ant-Man would be more appealing than the agonized Bruce Wayne which Christian Bale played.  This movie has a very important component which is missing from a lot of the heavy action movies today:  humor.  It also effectively feeds the audience information about the characters' backgrounds gradually.  The villain is as extreme as any other, wanting to terrorize the world with secret technology, but at least the movie spends a little time developing him, including a scientific explanation of how his natural ambition and the technology's effect on his brain chemistry both make him a psychopath.  Superheroes usually have several problems, among which are 1) they have to have dual identities, 2) they're trying to win the approval of a woman, and 3) they're susceptible to the negative effects of their supernatural powers, or a weakness which their supernatural enemy knows of.  Probably the best asset to how this movie uses the superhero formula and makes something new, is that Michael Douglas and the Ant-Man he's training, played by Paul Rudd--who could be interchangeable in this with Ben Affleck, I realized--both have to win the respect of their own daughters.  It's not even about a woman they're romantically in love with.  The Ant-Man has an interesting scientific explanation, which is that the distance between atomic particles has been shortened through human engineering (which the Michael Douglas character had done, and now regrets), so this suit enables its wearer to shrink to the size of an ant and then immediately back to full size with the click of a button, and also manipulate through mental focus ants which can do other jobs.  I don't think the movie explains whether the ants are totally mechanical or whether they are real ants which have been modified scientifically.  I find this movie to be refreshing in that it doesn't take on an intentionally dark aura in the noir style of Christopher Nolan, and I like the overall tone of it and writing of it.",1438041600,,2652,5.027397260273973

7281971,2,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Nine Things About the Film ""Ant Man""

1. This is the second-stupidest of all the Marvel films (""Thor"" is still the stupidest).

2. To its credit, the movie knows it can't be taken seriously, and it tries to have fun with itself for awhile. So it's not a complete disaster.

3. It follows one of the usual Marvel superhero formulas (a super billionaire corporation makes a scientific breakthrough and turns it into a super weapon. It ends up in the hands of a regular schmuck, and bad guys try to get the technology). Which means there is absolutely zero suspense to the story, because we've seen it in so many other Marvel movies.

4. The ""scientific breakthrough"" is a chemical that shrinks the distances between atoms of things but leaves the original power the same - whatever that means. This chemical is put into a suit that not only shrinks the suit, but anybody in the suit. OK, I admit, I'm actually not sure what the idea is, but I don't think I'm alone - the movie doesn't really want you to pay attention to how or why it works.

5. This movie is a mix of superhero movie and heist caper. The heist caper part (which was the first half of the movie) was better than the superhero part.

6. There are several scenes and conversations in the movie that let you know where it fits in the larger Marvel timeline.

7. This movie features another clunky Disney family drama, another smart-ass female sidekick/romantic interest, and some racial stereotypes. In addition, true to Marvel's worldview, lots of things can get destroyed with no actual consequences, human or otherwise (well, unless you carelessly shoot your own helicopter pilot).

8. The acting is pretty good, all things considered. Paul Rudd is a good choice to play such a ludicrous figure; his tongue-in-cheek charm is the right approach for the ex-convict who rides flying ants.

9. The movie starts off being stupid, but kind of clever, so it's actually fun. However, by the time we get to the last 30 minutes of the movie, it has lost its cleverness. It's just stupid.",1438041600,12,2042,4.65

Oh, and don't forget a Stan Lee cameo, as seems compulsory in these things. Then, Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly (as Hope van Dyne) put in good performances (of course) as the brilliant scientist who got the ball rolling and as his daughter, respectively. I hesitate even to mention the comic-relief side-kicks.

7281973,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"When I first heard they were making an Ant Man movie, I thought it was going to be ridiculous. But I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. Paul Rudd was very likable and it had a good mix of comedy and action going on. A very nice change from the darker Avengers 2 earlier this year. I like dark movies, but it's much more fun when movies are upbeat and don't take themselves too seriously. I left this movie with a smile on my face and a definite plan to buy the movie right away when it gets released on dvd",1437955200,,516,4.019417475728155
7281974,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Ant-Man introduces Paul Rudd as our new Avenger. Scott Lang (Rudd) is a thief/ hacker who spent time in jail. He wants nothing more than to go straight and establish a life with visitation rights for his daughter (Abby Ryder Fortson). His wife (Judy Greer) is about to move on with a policeman (Bobby Cannavale).

In a subplot Dr. Hank Pym is played by Michael Douglas who comes on the scene, almost doing an aside, and says ""I'm still alive."" He was part of a company that shrinks the space between atoms. It is now run by Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) with the assistance of his own daughter (Evangeline Lilly).

The two subplots come together with formula results, it was like watching the first ""Iron Man"" again which isn't too bad, just predictable. The script is filled with humorous moments and a few memorable lines. It leads us into an Avengers sequel which isn't bad for Paul Rudd fans.

Guide: No sex or nudity. Minor swearing. No F-bombs.",1437868800,,947,4.625
7281975,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"The Good-  Michael Douglas gives an energetic performance as Hank Pym and Paul Rudd looks extremely comfortable here.  He never forces the jokes and lets it flow, giving the movie a natural vibe to it.  The supporting cast offers a lot of comic relief (more than usual for a marvel film) and just about all the jokes/bits hit.  Evangaline (misspelled) Lilly is strong here as well (like the Black Widow in the original Avengers movie).  The villain is good (although somewhat more jokey than we are accustomed to).  However, just when you think the villain is a buffoon, he turns that switch and you realize he is no joke.  Aside from the excellent cast, they also put story/character development before the action.  This is what launches this movie into the upper echelon of Marvel movies.

Ant-man learns to use his powers and it is a process very much like Tony Stark in the first Iron man or Captain America.  We go through the journey with him.  That is laced with dramatic themes and humor masterfully.  The script is as tight as putting a plastic bag over your head.  Everything connects and makes sense.  It's extremely clever writing which works wonders for setting up the films ingenious action sequences.  The action in this movie is the most imaginative, fun, and well-directed pieces I have seen.....wow, maybe ever.  The camera moves in such a way where you feel you have shrunk down and everyday objects become extraordinary.  And regardless of how much is going on in a scene, you never lose sight of what is going on (and there some extremely intricate sequences here).  The final battle is the most creative fight sequence I've ever seen.

The Bad-  Not much here.  Except due to the story over action approach, there is a long stretch without an action sequence.  The movie could have used one more action sequence during this gap.  Also, as good as the script is, there are times when the dialogue seems a bit stiff (during the more serious moments).  These are minor gripes though.

The Deal-  I didn't care about Ant-Man at all.  This movie made me care about him.  I know some people are put off by the films more comedic approach (there are some very good dramatic moments to be seen), but it worked wonders for last year's Guardians of the Galaxy and it does here as well.  The most important thing here is that this movie is not some polished studio cash grab.  It has characters who are linked together.  There is a nice overall theme of the movie which is refreshing.  Ant-man can shrink down to microscopic size, but you can't shrink the heart of this movie. If you haven't seen this yet, see it twice to make up for lost time.",1437868800,8,2656,4.620985010706638
7281976,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Step number one in watching Marvel's Ant-Man is NOT to take it very seriously. The actors and filmmakers didn't and thats what works about this movie. Definitely the most comical of all the Marvel flicks thus far, Ant-Man is an enjoyable and lighthearted film that has a place in Marvel's Cinematic Universe but without any real consequences, yet.

It's difficult to make a story about a man that can shrink to the size of an ant, dark or mysterious, so knowing that the studio set out to make a movie that would bring in another one of their characters with a unique and useful skill-set that doesn't have a particularly incredible or original storyline. Paul Rudd was a good cast for the titular role and brings a nice blend of his comedy as well as some solid acting when needed.

If there was anything to really complain about in Ant-Man it may just be the Saturday morning cartoon villain ""Yellow Jacket"". Again, the movies doesn't really need a Thanos or Red Skull or Loki type villain but rather a one off villain that does just enough for Ant-Man to get his little feet wet in the MCU.

If you want a fun popcorn movie that has some good ties and nods to the MCU you'll probably like Ant-Man, and if you don't expect a super deep plot, incredibly unique characters or foreboding villain you will have the perfect mindset to watch this one.",1437782400,9,1347,4.534979423868313
7281977,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"I have to admit, I never heard of Marvel's Ant Man superhero until this came out, but I really enjoyed the movie. Hiring Paul Rudd to play Ant Man was genius- he is just so darn likeable, you can't help but root for him. I had more than a few laugh out loud moments watching him struggle to learn to manage the ant suit. Jokes for all ages are woven throughout the plot, which makes this movie a great choice if you're going with kids of different ages. Younger viewers will love the scene where a Thomas the Train engine is blown up in size, and it crashes out of a house into a confused crowd. The Ant Man also visits the Avengers, which is fun for Avengers fans. Recommended!",1437696000,2,678,4.223076923076923
7281978,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"The Marvel cinematic universe has been  around awhile, giving us epic films in a cohesive, connected world. Now that universe goes into a smaller direction with the release of Ant-Man, a film following two lead characters who have both worn the identity in the comics, and who, while very different in backgrounds, have some common ground. It's a lighter film with a good sense of humour that still plays to the strong characterization and history of the characters. Directed by Peyton Reed, who has a background in comedy, the film evokes the irreverent tone of last summer's Guardians Of The Galaxy while moving things into a very small scale indeed.

We first meet our hero Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), a thief with a tendency to break and enter and steal things- not quite your usual protagonist, but he's a charming sort of guy, and we get to like him regardless. His family life is a mess- he's trying to fix up his relationship with his young daughter Cassie, while his ex wife (Judy Greer) is now involved with a cop (Bobby Cannavale)- not the easiest thing for a crook to have to deal with. Scott is just out of prison, having second thoughts about his career choices- there has to be a better way to make a living, though he's still associating with criminals, including his former cellmate Luis (Michael Pena).

Scott crosses paths with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), a scientist who's become something of a bitter recluse after losing control of his company. Hank can relate to the family difficulties- he's a widower whose relationship with his daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) is strained, but he sees something in Scott worth redeeming. He's worried about the use of technology he's invented- Pym particles, which can shrink things down to the small scale- being converted for darker uses. Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), the one time protege who supplanted him, has his own agenda for that technology. Pym asks Scott for his help- which involves suiting up in a special uniform designed to assist the human body adapt to that small scale, with a few other tricks for good measure.

The film has been in the works for years, and Edgar Wright (Shaun Of The Dead) was once tapped to direct, having had co-written a story with Joe Cornish. Wright left the project over creative differences, and screenwriter Adam McKay (along with cast member Rudd) polished the story. McKay's background is also in comedy, as is Reed's- Reed directed films like Yes Man and The Break-Up- the comedic background of both writer and director show itself in the way the film comes across. It establishes the characters and weaves them firmly into the Marvel cinematic universe. And while there is an irreverent, comedic side of things, there's also strong characterization, from the parallel father-daughter strained relationships to the villain who doesn't see himself as such. Reed shows a deft touch as a director- I like the way he stages break and enter scenes, and he can handle action well. He paces the movie well, keeping things moving briskly along.

There's a healthy dose of CGI in the film, but it serves the story well, and doesn't feel like CGI. A lot of that has to do with how Scott interacts with the world at insect level, and certainly the ants he interacts with (and learns to communicate with) feel like they're sharing the same space as him. It also reflects in the sense the audience has that we're down at that same scale- a stream of water, for instance, has the look of a tsunami wave. Gunshots fired into a model city have a catastrophic feel, as well, when one is the size of an insect, and the special effects crews do fine work in conveying that.

I like the production values of the film. Pym's personal lab reflects the man himself, a place of curiousities. It's a contrast with the corporate sleekness of his former company, no longer in his control. That contrast also reflects itself in the two different tech designed uniforms making use of Pym Particles in the film. The Ant-Man uniform has influences from the various comics designs over the years, and has a utilitarian look to it, something you'd expect out of a scientist- efficient and purposeful. The Yellowjacket design that ends up coming into the picture is something else- sleek, aggressive, dangerous, and militaristic. Both designs suit the film well.

The casting was well done. There are the requisite cameos that you would expect. Stan Lee turns up, of course; the Marvel co-founder and writer has been doing a lot of these cameos in films done by Marvel Studios for years, as well as films based on characters from Marvel but produced by other studios. There are also references and nods to the larger cinematic universe- each of which is a treat for those wondering how this would all fit into the larger frame of things. Michael Pena as Luis fronts a group of petty crooks- but these characters aren't the heavies, they're comic relief, and Pena certainly plays to that, garnering some of the laughs along the way.

Corey Stoll has the look of a don't mess with me tough guy mode as an actor, and I've seen him in a number of roles, often playing villains or cops. He's got a hard look to him, and it serves him well as Cross, who comes across as a double dealing underhanded executive. Cross is the sort of villain who doesn't think of himself that way- he doesn't see his lack of ethics for what it is. In his mind he's in the right, and the ends justify the means. That reflects itself in the Yellowjacket design, which expresses his aggressiveness. The shades of gray of the character make him a compelling villain, and it's a good twist on the Yellowjacket concept- in the comics, Yellowjacket is in fact an alternate codename for Hank Pym.

Evangeline Lilly has made quite an impression, from her role on the series Lost to her turn as an elf in two parts of The Hobbit trilogy. I like her take on Hope. The character is smart and can take care of herself- something that certainly shows itself in the film. Ideally she might be the better fit for the uniform as a superhero- but the state of things with her father take things in a different direction. The relationship is so strained that she's taken on the surname of her late mother, and there's a lot of resentment and estrangement between them. Hope's journey as a character in the film is about reconciliation, and Lilly really plays to that as the film goes along. I wouldn't mind seeing the character perhaps take after her mother- the Marvel cinematic universe needs a Wasp.

A lot of changes have been done in terms of bringing Hank Pym from the comics to the big screen. The character is a founding Avenger in the comics, but here he is a scientist with ties to S.H.I.E.L.D. in the past. Where he is brilliant but occasionally mentally unstable in the comics, here he's brilliant but a recluse. And the story has added about thirty years onto his age. The essence of the character remains the same: a gifted, smart man with a strongly grounded sense of ethics. I like how Douglas conveys that in his performance, while bringing across the elements of worry the character feels at having his technology misused, the strain of loss in his life, and the difficulties he has with his daughter. Douglas also adds just the right touch of dry humour here and there. Hank Pym's a wise character- and a very human one, and I got to like him a lot through the film. It's a terrific take on the character.

I got to like Paul Rudd through the film as well. I've only seen him in one previous project of note- a television adaptation of The Great Gatsby- as I have not seen his numerous comedies in the last few years (I have a deep aversion to Judd Apatow as a director- the man's like fingernails on a blackboard to me). Rudd brings a charming, affable quality to the role of Scott Lang, a reluctant hero who grows into the role (a reminder of Peter Quill in last year's Guardians). The character's struggling to be a better person, if only for his daughter's sake, and that's the sort of thing the audience can relate to and root for, and Rudd brings that across in his performance. His initial status as a crook reminds me of George Clooney playing Danny Ocean- a disarming scoundrel with a plan. A reluctant hero he might be, but Lang does rise to the occasion in doing the right thing, and Rudd's portrayal takes the character through that journey.

Ant-Man is a new look at the Marvel cinematic universe that gives the audience fresh ground to cover while maintaining enough connections to the larger continuity. It's got a good sense of humour, likable lead actors who flesh out their characters in the right way, a very human heroine, and an underhanded antagonist with a mean streak. The film is an oddball kind of film- which makes it all the more appealing. I enjoyed it- and I look forward to seeing more of these characters down the line.",1437696000,6,8894,4.650763358778626
7281979,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe is often viewed as the new behemoth of modern cinema, often enlisting big names to create big (or bigger) films, but sometimes it can work in Marvel's favor to go a little bit smaller. And that's exactly what we get with director Peyton Reed's breezy and imaginative ANT-MAN. While it won't shatter records or go down as one of the MCU's great films, it's certainly deserves a spot alongside GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY as one of its most light-hearted.

ANT-MAN follows the story of three people: Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), a brilliant scientist with his own company and former member of S.H.I.E.L.D, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), a former electrical engineer turned professional burglar after pulls a Robin Hood on his former employer and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), Pym's estranged daughter and a high-level executive in his company. Pym has found that his former protg and current CEO of his company Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) is close to replicating Pym's formula for the miniaturization of people so that they can create a new breed of soldier wearing miniaturized mechanical suits, and Pym and Hope are willing to join together to stop this technology being weaponized. Lang has just been released from prison and can't even hold a job at Baskin-Robbins because of his criminal record. He's prevented from seeing his young daughter by a concerned ex-wife (Judy Greer) and her cop fianc (Bobby Cannavale) so via his best friend and former cellmate Luis (Michael Pena), he plans a theft. Unbeknownst to him, it's Pym's house he's breaking into and while the robbery is successful, there's nothing to steal besides Pym's old suit. Through a confluence of events, Lang ends up becoming the person that will help Pym and Hope steal the tech that the increasingly malevolent Cross is developing. Through mental and physical training by the two of them, Lang becomes Ant-Man and with an army of ants that he can mentally control and more of Pym's miniaturized tech, he might be able to pull it off.

The film, originally written by Brit visionaries Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish (with Wright originally slated to direct but ended up leaving due to creative differences), with punch-up done by Rudd himself and pal Adam McKay of the ANCHORMAN films and TALLEDEGA NIGHTS fame, has some moments that are incredibly inspired, and some that are pretty standard for the genre and you can kind of tell which writers are responsible for which moments. But this doesn't take away from the inventiveness of the film and the way that Reed, whose previous efforts include lo-fi films like BRING IT ON and THE BREAK-UP, does a really solid job of directing this film despite it having a LOT of really heavy CG work in it. One can't help but wonder what Wright's film might have looked and felt like, and I am positive that it would have been longer, more thoughtful and maybe even a little more playful, but it doesn't lessen what Reed and company do with this film.

The only really clunky moments in the film are the scenes in which Hope and Pym clash over his deceased wife and why he won't allow Hope to take the suit instead of Scott when she's so clearly able to, and also over Cross's motivations, which seem pretty malevolent from the get-go, but are later chalked up to something pretty silly. It's sad but it is a pattern of many of the MCU's films that the villains usually end up being underdeveloped and pretty one-dimensional (Loki not withstanding). By contrast the very best moments of the film are the ones that bring back a long-absent sense of wonder and awe to the superhero film. There really hasn't been a film that's done this since the first CAPTAIN AMERICA film. It used to be ""Oh my God, look what I can do!"" and now it's ""Look at me doing what I've done for a few films now, but in a different and probably cooler way"". ANT-MAN brings some crazy sci-fi fun back to the MCU. Dropping through shower drains and rug fibers and sucked into vacuum cleaners to a fight inside a briefcase and in a child's room with miniature train sets inspires the kind of awe that superhero films should. And if any film that the MCU has created should be counted as being ""kid-friendly"", it would be this film.

The performances in the film are all very good. Rudd is so effortlessly charming (even if he isn't given an opportunity to cut loose with more acerbic brand of humor), Douglas brings just the right amount of gravitas to the production, Lilly does great work with a kind of underwritten role, Stoll is just kind of... there, which is sad considering the fantastic performance he gave in the first season of HOUSE OF CARDS, but the real standout here is the hilariously motormouthed Pena. A lesser performer might have made Luis more of a caricature, but he does really solid work here. Even Cannavale has an interesting if slightly predictable arc.

And as far as cameos are concerned, this film has possibly the greatest two cameos of every single Marvel film as of yet. One was sadly spoiled by the film itself in its commercials, but if by chance you HAVEN'T heard about it yet, I'll leave it alone because the whole scene is so great. But there's another cameo that maybe one out of a thousand viewers of the film will get, but it hearkens back to a famous early SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE skit that had me doubled over in laughter and amazement at what a REALLY deep cut this cameo is. And yes, STAY THROUGH THE ENTIRE CREDITS, DAMMIT.

Again, ANT-MAN isn't an instant classic, and it won't rank amongst the MCU's best offerings, but it sure is a good time at the movies.",1437696000,2,5600,4.680203045685279
7281980,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Ant-Man changes the scale of the Marvel Universe; pun intended.  For the casual viewers, know that in the comics, the original Ant-Man and his wife, The Wasp, were founding members of The Avengers.  Marvel has rearranged that origin story, but finally bring the character into the fold for this next phase.

The original Ant-Man, Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas in crafty old-man mode), worked for SHIELD during the Cold War (as established in a flashback prologue where hes arguing with Howard Stark and Peggy Carter, SHIELD founders, over the use of his shrinking formula).  Since then, he has kept his tech and secrets under wraps; from SHIELD, from his closest coworkers, even from his daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly, clearly ready for her Marvel moment).  The company he founded, Pym Tech, is under new leadership (Hanks ambitious protg Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), whos trying (literally sacrificing lambs) to shrink organic matter to sell to military interests.  Pym knows how terrible it would be for that tech to get into the wrong hands, so he devises an against-all-odds heist to break into his old building, steal the new tech, destroy any records, and keep the world safe.  He just needs a wily burglar to pull it off.

The one he finds is Scott Lang, a Robin Hood criminal who did time for embezzling from greedy corporate interests, and fresh out of jail, cant even keep a job at Baskin Robbins.  He falls back in with some old heist-mates who have heard of a major new score; break into an old house with a secret vault which is supposed to harbor a fortune.  They orchestrate a high-tech robbery in which Lang uses some clever McGyver gimmickry to annihilate the locks and safe, but all thats in the vault is Ant-Mans old suit.  He steals it anyway, and back at his place, cant help but put it on; which is exactly what Dr. Pym manipulated.  Here is when the wild ride starts, as some superb and creative shrinking effects show Langs harsh education in the power and perils of being miniscule.

Of course Lang joins the cause, for noble purposes as opposed to any reward, much to Hopes dismay (she wanted to don the suit to carry out the mission).  There are many inventive scenes of his training, which include mastering some form of mind control over ants, leaping like a bullet through keyholes, and shrinking/enlarging at the press of a button.  When it comes time to pull off the heist, Darren Cross has other ideas, revealing his loyalty to the rebuilding Hydra using his newly developed shrinking suit, the Yellowjacket.

Ant-Man contains some of the weakest story links in the Marvel worlda brilliant scientist, Hank Pym wouldnt likely entrust the fate of the world to a complete unknown.  Scott Langs motivations for being a thief, his divorce, and even his devotion to his daughter are largely unexplained.  Langs trio of criminal compadres (Michael Pena, T.I., and David Dastmalchian) are played solely for laughs and get tiresome.  Telepathically ordering an army of ants to do ones bidding, even in the comic book world, just seems a serious stretch.  But the film uses its humor well and Paul Rudd is so likeable as the underdog that the faults are easy to overlook.  Like Robert Redford in Captain America: Winter Soldier, screen vet Douglas brings a lot of elder statesman gravitas to the movie.  The effects, done with macrophotography and motion capture, are spectacular and inventive.  And for the Marvel fans, there are plenty of Easter Eggs laid to geek out about, as well as an awesome fight with a current (and greatly upgraded) Avenger.  The story, which apparently still contains chunks of Edgar Wrights original screenplay (Wright had been developing Ant Man for years, but was ousted from the project over creative differences), is filled with some frantic visual humor but plenty of heart.  Director Peyton Reed (Yes Man, Bring it On) juggles the action and pathos to good effect without being too heavy-handed and reigning in the Looney Tunes aspect of the story.

Still, its hard to take Ant-Man as seriously as the other Avengers; playing him so lightly makes him a very odd fit in a future Avengers world, though we shall see once the younger, funnier Spider Man debuts.  One sequence involves a battle between Ant Man and Yellowjacket on a Thomas the Train play set.  Funny, but out of sorts with the MCU.  Another sequence has Lang shrinking into a quantum realm; instead of profound insights, we get dizzying abstract visuals just short of a Friday-night laser show soundtracked by Pink Floyd.  For summer entertainment, Ant-Man is not the cosmic lunacy of Guardians of the Galaxy, or the world-stakes thriller of Captain America: Winter Soldier, but its a solid shot of Marvel adrenaline that will hold us over until Captain America: Civil War.

CLICHES:  Set in San Francisco, because of course.  I guess New York City was busy.
SURPRISES: Hey, no destruction of the Golden Gate Bridge!
KID FACTOR:  some bad language and sacrificial lambs turned to jelly (no, really); blatant abuse of Thomas the Train

7281981,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"The least godly of all the Marvel heroes, Ant-Man is just a mildly intelligent, crafty guy, down on his luck but pure of heart, who catches the eye of a reclusive genius and becomes heir to his technological throne. It's not intergalactic like Guardians, it boasts no billionaire playboys like Iron Man, no political intrigue or mythological hijinx like Cap or Thor, and while all of those absences do make it feel like less of a heavyweight, they also give it a unique sense of relatable identity. This is the little guy (womp womp), one of the unwashed throngs, who dares to climb Olympus and greet the immortals. I can get behind that. It's also a great showcase of the merry Marvel mojo, casually blending well-timed wisecracks with steep ideas, loud action sets and a heavy dose of worldbuilding. That constant sense of a shared landscape, long a cornerstone of the comic book's universe, has begun to bear ripened fruit recently, and Ant-Man profits from the mere association. Truly, it's his interactions with the characters we already know, no matter how secondary they may be, that makes this seem like more than just another origin story. Paul Rudd does a nice job of pulling off the leading role, not too wacky nor too straight-laced, and his essential chemistry with Michael Douglas (the aforementioned genius) carries the picture a nice, long distance. Great effects work gets us the rest of the way, with a whole armload of inventive, fascinating, smirk-inducingly cool expositionary scenes leading the charge. Think Honey, I Shrunk the Kids with more balls and a much bigger budget. It's not the best of the Marvel lot, but it's among them, and I can't wait to see where the character goes from here.",1437609600,2,1715,4.856655290102389
7281982,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"When I first heard Marvel was going to make an Ant-Man movie, to say I was skeptical is a textbook understatement. Ant-Man? Were they kidding? A superhero who shrinks to the size of an ant? What could he accomplish?

Quite a lot, as it turns out. The more I saw and heard about the movie, the more eager I was to see it. I was not disappointed. This is Marvel's best since Guardians of the Galaxy. It has just the right balance of action and humor. With fewer characters, there's more room for character development--and what characters they are!

The story opens in 1987 at SHIELD headquarters in Washington DC. Scientist Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) is confronting SHIELD director Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), co-founder Howard Stark (John Slattery) and Mitchell Carson (Martin Donovan) about unauthorized use of his discovery. After punching Carson, Pym walks out.

Fast forward to the present. At the San Quentin prison, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is about to be released. He's picked up outside the gates by his former partner in crime, Luis (Michael Pena). Luis has a tip for a hot job, but Lang declines. He's determined to go straight--but his plan goes awry when he's fired from a job at Baskin Robbins and kicked out of his young daughter's birthday party.

He decides to join Luis and their friends on the aforementioned heist. He breaks in the home of a retired scientist (who turns out to be Hank Pym) and opens the old basement vault--where he finds only what appears to be ""an old motorcycle suit and helmet."" He takes the suit--and discovers its incredible secret. It reduces him to the size of an insect.

He soon discovers that Pym wanted him to break in, to take the suit. Pym offers him a second chance, a chance to become the hero his little girl believes him to be.

All he has to do is steal something.

Lang has his doubts, but agrees to work with Pym. He soon discovers he and Pym have something in common: they both want to improve their relationships with their daughters. Pym's daughter, Hope Van Dyne, has been estranged from him since the death of her mother, Janet, Pym's late wife--which is why she's taken her mother's maiden name. She's come to her father now because his former protege, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), is close to duplicating Hank's Pym particles, which allow one to reduce in size but increase in strength, and is planning to sell Yellowjacket suits similar to Pym's Ant-Man suit to Pym's old adversary, Mitchell Carson--who, it turns out, is an agent of HYDRA.

Hope wants to put on the Ant-Man suit and do what needs to be done herelf. As she points out, she knows her way around Pym Technologies and has the trust of Darren Cross. Hank won't hear of it. The suit has taken a toll on him, and though he's never told Hope, it was responsible for the death of her mother.

First, Lang must retrieve something of Pym's from an old Stark warehouse in upstate New York. Trouble is, it's no longer an old Stark warehouse. It's now an Avengers facility--where Ant-Man has a fight with Falcon (Anthony Mackie).

Will Lang, Pym and Van Dyne succeed? Will Pym ever tell Hope how her mother really died? Is Janet really dead? Will Scott Lang be reunited with Cassie? Will Falcon come looking for Ant-Man? And above all, will there be an Ant-Man 2? I sure hope so!",1437609600,2,3298,4.622222222222222
7281983,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"This film may not be as sleek as Age of Ultron or Winter Soldier, but it is entertaining and has a heart.  It's nice to see Paul Rudd out of his slapstick, comedic roles and getting down to business as Ant-Man.  Though, I think he underplays his role in this film, it's still fun to watch a non-hunky, ""everyday"" type of guy transform into superhero.  He's not the blond, buff beauty of Thor or Captain America, but he's a welcome change once the movie gets underway.

There are some nice story elements about family and fatherhood in Ant-Man.  However, the script does get a bit messy and flimsy.  Despite the lack of polish in the script writing, it's still a fun flick to watch.  I suggest it for anyone wanting some action on screen and to see the story of a man searching for a second chance in life.  I also feel the film is over-directed and that the actors (Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, even Paul Rudd) don't really get to loosen up and let their personalities shine.  However, the film still works.

What the film lacks in script quality,  it certainly makes up for in special effects.  These are excellent as Ant-Man jumps from the size of a penny to a full-human instantly.  I feared this would be a ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" kind of a ""let's hang out on a button"" movie, but it isn't at all.  The presentation of an ant-sized world is much more sophisticated than that, and the instant jump from ant-sized to man-sized is the highlight of this film.  It makes for some impressive fight scenes and non-stop action moments.

A fun surprise is Paul Rudd's three friends.  They certainly add color, humor, and a bit of irreverence---somewhat surprising for a comic hero movie.  They consist of a Hispanic, an African American, and a Russian-- all small-time criminals who add some spice here.  Shout out to the director for casting rapper, T.I. as one of the friends.  I've never seen him in a movie before and he absolutely nails it in Ant-Man.

The story isn't perfect, but this is still a great film, especially for all those comic book fans out there.  Oh yea, watch for the Thomas the Train in the film-- it's kooky, but hilarious.

Kid Factor:  Just 2 lines that are kind of raunchy.  No profanity.  No ""lovey"" scenes.  Only moderate violence and very mild compared to other superhero films like Captain America:  Winter Soldier and Avengers:  Age of Ultron.",1437609600,3,2379,4.597619047619047
7281984,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,I really enjoyed this movie... I will try not to give any spoilers.  Some background first though I did read the most recent issues of Ant-man when they came out and so I went into this knowing that it was going to have a sense of humor because the comics written with Scott Lang had their fair share of sense of humor.  The movie at its core is a heist movie and as with any heist there has to be planning and setting up of the heist.  The movie does do its best at making the setup as fun as possible.  Knowing this though you have to understand that this is not the city dropping or city destroying movies of the Avengers but something more that takes time to lay the ground work for the action. So the first act is the introduced the second act is the planning and the third act is the action.  Overall the movie has a tremendous sense of humor and has laugh out loud moments.  Paul Rudd was perfect for the movie.  I also really was looking forward to an Edgar Wright directed Ant-man but at least they kept some of his presence in the movie.  I recommend this movie for comic and superhero fans.  Oh and while there is a mid-scene credit make sure you stay until the very end there is post credit scene that is worth seeing..  Enjoy!!,1437609600,5,1240,4.194092827004219
7281985,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Decades ago, Isaac Asimov asserted that science fiction wasn't so much as its own genre as it was a vehicle for other genres. As there was much dissent, he set out to write a sci-fi detective novel which became the first of his robot novels, The Caves of Steel. It seems that Marvel has set out to prove the same thing about the super hero genre. Sure, there's the pure super hero stuff like The Avengers, but we've also seen a war movie, an espionage movie, and, now, a heist movie, among others.

So, yeah, Ant-Man is structured as a heist movie, which is pretty clever. It's not a straight heist, though, there's a little, I don't know, rom-com(?) added in. You know, whatever kind of movie it is where the guy who has messed up and alienated his family has to put it back together again. At any rate, as Scott Lang says in the movie, ""It's not just a heist.""

Speaking of Scott Lang, Lang was one of my few worries about the movie going into it. As I've noted in previous reviews of Marvel movies (especially Iron Man 3), I do understand that the universe of the Marvel movies is not the same as the one for the comics, but I couldn't understand why they weren't having Hank Pym be Ant-Man when he was going to be in the movie. It was baffling. BUT! I think they did an excellent job of threading the Ant-Man origin story into what they did in the movie. Actually, I really like what they did with that. It adds some extra layers to the movie than just doing an ""origin story.""

Also speaking of Scott Lang, Paul Rudd was great. Okay, so, I already really like Paul Rudd, but he was great in this role. This is another case of Marvel finding an actor who would really own the part and make it his, because that's what Rudd did. However, it was Michael Pena as Luis who almost stole the show. He was brilliant, and the voice-over stuff they did with him was hilarious.

Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lily were both very good. Douglas probably about what you'd expect since he's always really solid. Lily was better than I expected because my main exposure to her has been in the horrible Hobbit movies, and, though those weren't her fault, her inclusion in those has been a sore point. I was also glad to see Wood Harris in the movie. His performance wasn't extraordinary or anything, but I like him as an actor, so it was good to see him in a high profile movie.

The only weak link was Corey Stoll who came off more as an over enthusiastic used car salesman trying to sell you a bad car than as a real villain. Fortunately, the movie didn't focus so much on him.

Also, the scene with the Falcon was awesome. I love Anthony Mackie in that role, so I was glad they included him. ""It's really important to me that Cap never finds out about this.""

Basically, this is another really solid Marvel movie and, while I would quite put it as high as Captain America or Iron Man on quality, it's close. Guardians of the Galaxy close. I would have gone right back in to watch it again if I could have.",1437609600,93,2997,4.3126110124333925
7281986,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Nice plot. I especially like that the movie is not even close to the mundane global destruction. I mean, seriously, I've seen enough cities dropping from sky (no offense Age of Ultron), but this one is funny and humorous. Paul nailed it as Scott Lang. His easy acting style really brought the Ant Man to life. I have to admit that I didn't hold a high expectation for this movie -- it was not heavily advertised anyways, but it turned out to be so much fun! I can't wait to see Ant Man return in the future.

7281988,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"The Movie Review by Andy McKinney

Ant-Man
 This one might surprise you.  I looks like just another massive special effects driven summer film to delight and amaze the watchers in the dark.  I think it more closely resembles a heart felt drama wrapped up in a gigantic special effects driven blockbuster.  It has elements and depths that we don't often see in a film based on yet another of the seemly infinite supply of Marvel Comic characters.  Imagine the movie as an M&M with a hard, crisp crust of special effects-flying ants, battles between suit clad miniature people and the like but the shell covers a soft creamy center of of man working through his problems and trying to keep his relationship with his daughter from disappearing in his own missteps.  Explosions, ant armies, nasty bad guys and yet a strongly appealing and very human story under it all-we get something special with Ant-Man.
 The good parts I have to credit to screen writer Joe Cornish, an Englishman who also directs and acts when the occasion presents itself.  He did have help from three other writers on the screen play, including star Paul Rudd.  Did Rudd pen the quips for his character?
 Rudd stars as the convict recruited by the Sane Scientist played by Michael Douglas to battle the Mad Scientist played by the sufficiently diabolical and insane Corey Stoll (House of Cards).  Douglas gets plenty of screen time and uses it very profitably, buffing his reputation to a new luster.  Evangeline Lily plays her role as the daughter of the Sane Scientist with vigor and a muted sense of humor.  She seems to enjoy training the soon-to-be Ant-Man in martial arts and occasionally punching his lights out.
 We have a deep second bench of good actors with interesting things to do, something that for me makes a movie much more fun and engaging than otherwise.  Judy Greer is nuanced as Ant-Man's estranged wife, Anthony Makie enjoys himself in a few scenes as The Falcon, another Marvel character.  John Slattery plays Howard Stark (this Marvel episode pre-dates the action in the current Iron Man films).  Wood Harris, late of The Wire, plays a cop with a few lines while Saturday Night Live legend Garrett Morris has a cameo and does the creator of the Marvel Universe, Stan Lee.
 Director Peyton Reed is best remembered for lighter films like Bring it On and Yes Man but he bosses this complicated mix of a film without getting in the way of the writers and players.
 Ant-Man lasts one hour and 57 minutes and provides solid family friendly fare with a PG-13 rating.  On a budget of $130 million it garnered some $113 million at the world wide box office so far and seems headed for a good if not spectacular profit.
 Ant-Man comes to the viewer in either regular 2-D or the modern incarnation of 3-D.  I would recommend seeing it in 3-D for the fun of having tiny Ant-Man bouncing around above the seats in front of you.
 These three saw blades of summer entertainment come with a little more substance for adults.",1437436800,,3002,4.706896551724138
7281989,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"A cat burglar (Paul Rudd) is recruited by a scientist (Michael Douglas) to use the shrinking suit he developed to liberate his technology from his unscrupulous former protege (Corey Stoll) before he can sell a weaponized version of it to HYDRA.

Although I did enjoy this film, it had a bit of a perfunctory feel to it.  It leaned heavily on the humor and it was never quite as funny as it wanted to be.  However, I do appreciate the way Marvel is willing to take a risk on some of its more obscure characters and I liked that the stakes in this film, although high, did not have to include the destruction of the universe.  Ant-Man is a goofy winner and I look forward to seeing him again in the next Captain America movie.",1437436800,,724,4.340740740740741
7281990,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Paul Rudd is one of my favorite actors, and I find him to be hilarious. When I heard he was going to be in Ant-Man, however, I was a little apprehensive and nervous about how Rudd would do in a superhero role. I'm not familiar with the Ant-Man comics or his origin story, but I really enjoyed the movie and thought Rudd did a great job. He seemed surprisingly agile and believable as a cat burglar-turned-superhero while bringing his personality and typical brand of humor to the role.

For those unfamiliar with the movie, Scott Lang (Rudd) gets out of prison for burglary and is determined to keep things on the up-and-up and be someone his daughter (the adorable Abby Ryder Fortson) can be proud of. That soon proves to be difficult when Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) recruits Scott to put on Pym's Ant-Man suit to shrink down, pull off a heist, and save the world.

Ant-Man was a superhero I pretty much didn't know existed until news of the movie's production reached my ears a year or so back. Seeing this movie really peaked my interest in Ant-Man, and I can't wait to see more of him. A superhero modeled after an ant was surprisingly interesting, enjoyable, and exciting. But, the best part of the movie for me was actually Michael Pena, who played Scott's friend Luis. Pena had some great one-liners, and he stole every scene he was in. The movie as a whole was humorous, and obviously Rudd was funny, but Pena was just such a fun surprise for me, and I couldn't get enough of him.

Overall, I thought this movie was really enjoyable. It was a little different, and I enjoyed seeing more about a superhero that was previously unknown to me, rather than seeing another superhero movie about am oversaturated character.",1437350400,3,1728,4.603896103896104
7281991,3,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Peyton Reed tries his hand at the comic book genre and provides a solid win for Marvel with just a few quick complaints.  Let's ignore those right now and focus on the good for the moment.  Rudd is amazing and makes this D-List character both believable and thoroughly entertaining.  Douglas, likewise, breathes a refreshing life into Pym.  However, it is Pena who absolutely steals the show, although a bit stereotypical at times, he owns every frame he is in. The remaining cast is solid, not extraordinary, as in other Marvel fare, but strong enough to be engaging and fun.  The effects are top notch, beautifully thrilling to watch, creating both the endearingly genuine and incredibly fantastic as script and scene dictate.  The origin story is well crafted as a whole and moves fluidly, but there are some issues.  The editing is choppy at times.  In fact, the acts almost feel rushed and shortened just as they are about to reach their emotional apex lessening their respective impact, drama, or humor.  Also, Rudd and Lily's relationship is a bit stale, too abrupt, and unconvincing which was disappointing.  Despite those two variables, this is still a cinematic joy ride in true Marvel Studio style.  In addition, it is chock full of enough Easter eggs and foreshadowing mid and post credit scenes to make even the most discerning fanboy smile widely.  It's not the best of the Phases, but a nice addition to a remarkable franchise, which is no small feet, even if they have six legs.  You know I had to fit an insect joke in there somewhere.",1437350400,2,1552,4.7894736842105265
7281992,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Ant-Man, is a man who shrinks to a size of an ant, can control and ride ants, 'nough said. This is great beginning to what is hoped to be a few more (action, sci-fi, comedy) Ant-Man films to come.

The concept is good given that we are establishing a Marvel Comic character into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Now given that the heart of the premise was more of a heist movie, a Michael Mann/Frank Pierson embellishment would had been nice for Edgar Wright to have been inspired by on top of his Simon Pegg film style that was absent in Ant-Man, within the screenplay.

Ant-Man is defiantly a fan boy and girl film for all ages (although PG-13). Anyone who loves Ant-Man will love seeing him filmed on Panavision. For the non fans of comic books and comic book films this film is pretty much your Summer Blockbuster fair, though better than you would expect. Moreover, that famous comic book relationship between Scott and Hope will have to wait till Ant-man 2, unfortunately.

Ant-Man is definitely an original high-concept superhero for the big screen. Not since Lily Tomlin's Incredible Shrinking Woman, James Bolin's Fantastic Voyage, Meg Ryan's Innerspace, and best of all Rick Moranis' Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, have you had such fun watching a person shrink. A little trivia is that Ant-Man was not developed in the 80's due to Honey, I Shrunk the Kids being made at the time. Waiting twenty-five years for Ant-Man was a bit too long.

""This is your chance to earn that look in your daughters eyes, to become the hero that she already thinks you are,"" Hank says to Scott. The film's theme wasn't strong enough on the father/daughter relationship as Transformers was with a boy and his car. ""It's not about saving our world. It's about saving theirs,"" was touching line from Hank to Scott and essentially is what the movie was about even though it was weak in delivering that poignant message. Filmmakers state the theme is ""passing the torch,"" which is visible in watching Ant-Man as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, as a stand alone film the theme of 'second chances' seems to out-play the 'passing of the torch.' Moreover, subplots were fair to say the least; some Chinatown-esque subplots would had been nice the enrich the Pym's company premise.

Overall, the movie was well done in true Marvel excellence. Kevin Feige is doing a fantastic job and the effort he puts towards these films is to be commended. The predictability, is to be desired, there are no twists and turns similar to those in other work by Edgar Wright.

The characters played well to the comic standards even though you won't be getting any Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967) character richness that you would want in this family affair between Scott, Hope and Hank. The casting is superb, Paul Rudd could not had been casted any better; however, his background in the film needed more depth. Michael Pena was fantastic as the comedic relief. Most of all, seeing Michael Douglas in this role was perfect. Pierce Bronson, who was up for the role, would had had a different line on the character, which might have been fun too. Stan Lee's cameo is one of the best yet. Moreover, the villain, Darren Cross, was cookie-cutter and lackluster and is Bug-B-Gone'd by the movie's end.

The contemporary setting in San Francisco, where it was mainly shot, was fine, given that San Francisco seems to be in every major release this Summer, is getting a bit overused. Setting this movie in some other tax-incentive states other than Georgia (where it was also shot at Pinewood Studios) would be a nice change of scenery. Although, the production design was great location scouting in choosing Hank's home. Pym's facility wasn't half bad either.

The visual effects were fantastic. Without giving away spoilers, the ants will stand the test of time, the train set scene is realistically done and the Thomas Train is hilarious. The macro photography used in this film is a what made all the difference in this film being a great ride that we can all enjoy and don't feel we are in some animated world but instead in that of our own live-action world. Superb job! As was the great mime-esque stunts that were executed. The cinematography was done crisply by Russell Carpenter, who had a nod to his academy award-winning work for Titanic in the film with a few lines of jokes about the Titanic ship and movie.

While the story and screenplay is in part done by Edgar Wright, he was to direct before dropping due to ""creative differences."" While the film is well done, it does miss that Edgar Wright touch and it is quite noticeable and would had been a vastly different film than what is presented before us by Peyton Reed of Bring It On (and a few other romantic comedies). Perhaps, this was a bit too much to chew for Reed but he handled it well. Though much like Superman 2 (1980), there is a much added difference between the theatrical film and the Richard Donner cut DVD release. That same difference would apply here in having seen an Edgar Wright directed film. Here's hoping Edgar can be back for Ant-man 2, eh.

Overall: this is a great film to see up close and personal with or without the kids in tow but definitely a must watch now (in the theater) rather than later (i.e. Blu-Ray) type of film. Don't forget to stay till the very end of the credits, it'll be worth it.",1437264000,,5364,4.678685047720043
7281993,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Theatrical review.  Possible spoilers.  I have to admit I was a bit skeptical about this new Marvel film.  I mean Paul Rudd?  And an ant-size superhero?  Come on.  I will also say that my depth of knowledge regarding Marvel's comic book characters is relatively shallow, limited to those on the silver screen.  Having said all that, I found this new film very refreshing.

Rudd is Scott Lang, a recently released ""burglar, not a robber"" as he often emphasizes.  Divorced from Maggie (Judy Greer), they have a cutesy, plum of a daughter, Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson), who he doesn't see enough.  Maggie has taken up with a policeman (Bobby Cannavale), but he seems to be a nice enough guy.  In a nicely conceived ""trap,"" Scott and his 3 partners in crime (Michael Pena, David Dastmalchian and rapper T. I.) are lured into the home of Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), the former head of a company that does technical research, often for the government or S.H.I.E.L.D.

In an interesting flashback scene, we see Pym and Agent Peggy Carter's (Hayley Atwell) real actor ages reversed.  That is, Pym looks youthful and Carter, old.  All thanks to some nifty CGI and makeup.  Pym's old company is now run by his former protg, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll, bald this time).  He has been working on Pym's old project to reduce matter to a miniature size but with increased strength...like an ant.  Pym had stopped working on it years earlier, concerned about it potential for weaponization and chemical side effects.  Pym's supposedly estranged daughter, Hope (Evangeline Lilly), is second in command within Cross's organization.

Pym realizing that he must destroy the near breakthrough of Cross and his ""Yellowjacket"", recruits Scott and integrates him into the ways of miniaturization and insect mind-control.  The film will be a bit talky for some fans, but it's all necessary to integrate those of us unfamiliar with the comics.  All is well and gets going once Scott becomes Ant-Man and introduces himself (and us) to the variety of ants found underground.

The film is full of CGI wizardry and has some fun closing scenes.  In fact the whole film is fun and funny in addition to being entertaining.  Overall the film is a nice change of pace, from the more recent bombastic, world destroying Marvel films.  Fans will want to stick around through the closing credits for a couple of extra scenes and a hint of the Marvel film future.",1437264000,,2425,4.85609756097561
7281994,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe continues to grow with each release. From this year's success of Avengers Age of Ultron, and even last year's surprise in Guardians Of The Galaxy, they continue to entertain and create wonder. And now we have a new addition to the universe: Ant-Man.

After being released from prison, Scott Lang reunites with his friend Luis. Scott's daughter Cassie is having her birthday, but her mom's fiance Jim refuses to allow Scott to see his daughter unless he provides child support. A failed attempt at Baskin Robbins leaves Scott no choice but to go back to his ways; and upon attempting to execute a robbery, Scott discovers a suit-the Ant-Man suit.

I was a little surprised when Paul Rudd was first cast as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, but he is actually a joy to watch as the character. Rudd is his usual humorous self numerous times in the movie-but when he is with his daughter Cassie, there are moments that you can't help but smile and make him even more likable. And it could certainly be argued that both Michael Douglas and Michael Pena nearly steal the show in the movie. Michael Pena's character Luis is both humorous and clever, but Michael Douglas's Hank Pym is perhaps the most fitting and fulfilling character to watch throughout the film. Corey Stoll also does a good job as antagonist Darren Cross/Yellowjacket; while Evangeline Lily's character Hope make a nice addition to the cast along with rapper/actor TI who plays Dave.

In terms of storytelling, Ant-Man rewards the audience with both humor and action; but also some notable references/easter eggs of what is to come in the future of Marvel films. If I told you what they were, I would be spoiling them entirely-but I will say that once the scenes between the credits began to play, I could not help but to smile even harder. And I definitely enjoyed the 3rd act of the movie-SERIOUSLY I do feel the 3rd act of the movie is the strongest act of the movie. Ant-Man is even better when you get to see the fight scenes, and Paul Rudd in the Ant-Man suit. But as a movie, Ant-Man proves that Marvel will continue to entertain and reward audiences everywhere; thanks to a very likable cast(especially Douglas, Pena, and Rudd), the story(which delivers an engrossing 3rd act), and the direction of Peyton Reed. I enjoyed Ant-Man and consider the movie to be

7281996,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Ant-Man is cheesy good fun in the best way possible. It almost feels like an old school 1980's comic book movie that doesn't take itself too seriously (Like most DC comic movies nowadays) and has the right amount of comedy with crazy action. There are plenty of references to the other MCU films and even some surprise cameos. I would say this movie is equal to 'Guardians of the Galaxy' I loved the concept of a cat burglar wanting a chance of redemption by doing what's right and trying patch things up with his family. Paul Rudd seems like the best choice for Scott Lang. He doesn't seem like he'd be the superhero type because of his past, but by the end of the film, he proves that he's worthy to don the Ant-Man suit. This review WILL contain spoilers.

After being released from prison, Scott Lang swears off crime for good because he wants to do right by his daughter, but he can't hold a job because of his edgy past, so he's forced to pull off one more job by breaking into a house and finds the Ant-Man suit. Little does he know, the house he broke into was set up by Hank Pym, the scientist who created the technology of the Ant-Man suit. Hank thinks Scott is the perfect man for the job. He's to use the suit to break into a top secret building and steal the deadly Yellowjacket suit, which if used in the wrong way could cause major wars and destruction.

With the powers of the Ant-Man suit, Scott is able to shrink down to the size of an ant. He can control ants and other insects with his mind and help aid him in his mission. In conclusion, I thought this was a very decent addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. Filled with good action, good comedy, good storyline, and cool references. If you love comic book and superhero movies, I highly recommend ANT-MAN!!!",1437264000,2,1791,4.391566265060241
7281997,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"When it was first announced that Ant-Man was getting a movie, plenty of comic fans, me included, were skeptical. Despite the character's importance of being one of the founding members of the Avengers, he's still, none the less, treated as one of the more strange and ""dorky"" superheroes, with his powers of shrinking (and later growing) and communicating with ants.  Still, I reserved judgment until I saw it. If the MCU could pull off a talking raccoon and tree in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", then surely they could pull off a superhero that was just as strange.

I'm happy to say the MCU has done it again. This was not only better than ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (in my opinion), but it's also the best movie I've seen this year.

In 1989, scientist Hank Pym resigns from S.H.I.E.L.D. after discovering they attempted to replicate the shrinking technology he's developed. Believing the technology is dangerous (especially in the wrong hands), Pym vows to suppress it as long as he lives. Cut to the present day, and Pym's prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Darren Cross, forces him out of his own company, Pym Technologies, while also revealing he's close to perfecting a shrinking suit of his own.  Meanwhile, master thief, Scott Lang, is released from prison, and tries to forge a better life for himself so he can provide for his daughter. As he is unable to hold down a job due to his criminal record, Scott agrees to an offer by some of his former prison-mates for a burglary job. But as he quickly finds out, the ""job"" was really a test by Hank Pym, who hires Scott to become the new Ant-Man, and steal Darren Cross' shrinking suit before he has a chance to use it for evil. With the help of Hank's daughter, Hope, Scott must master the ability to communicate with ants, and, along with the power to shrink and grow at will, must pull off the most incredible robbery of all time.

I've started to notice that most of the MCU films have covered most of the main genres of movies with their characters. Hulk gave us a monster movie. Thor gave us a fantasy/mythical movie. Captain America gave us a war film. Black Widow and pretty much any of the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents give us a spy film. And the Guardians of the Galaxy gave us a full on science fiction/space epic.  And now, with Ant-Man, the MCU has given us their take on the classic ""Ocean's Eleven-ish""/heist film. And considering Ant-Man's powers, it makes total sense; he's the perfect guy for espionage. For the naysayers who always pegged his character as dorky or too weird, you'll definitely be singing a different tune after seeing this. The technology he uses to shrink and grow is used to its fullest extent, and in various funny and clever ways (which I dare not spoil here). And the way he communicates with all sorts of breeds of ants to do various jobs is both interesting and amazing.  I can't believe it, but this movie actually makes you sympathize and cry over an ANT for pete's sake.

All of the characters are likeable (save for the villains of course), relatable, or funny (or a combo of the three). Scott may have started as a thief, but the force that drives him is to be able to take care of his daughter and family, and in becoming a superhero, he turns his life around and puts his skills to a good cause. Hank Pym (who was the original Ant-Man, both in this movie and in the comics) fights to keep his technology out of the wrong hands (and has a big part to play, and isn't just the ""wise old advice-spilling mentor"" who tends to disappear halfway through the film). The theme of repairing a family also extends to Hank and his daughter, Hope, who is arguably much better suited to be the superhero. But Hank forbids her from using the suit, fearing for her safety, especially after having lost his wife, Janet (who was the character Wasp in the comics). Even Scott's burglar buddies get in on the action, and while they're mostly the comic reliefs, they don't take away from the important plot points, and are just as likeable (and not annoying).

On the subject of Wasp, however; considering how she's just as important to the Avengers mythos and Ant-Man himself, many fans were miffed to find out she wasn't going to be in the movie (and worse, killed off). Many female fans, especially, were lobbying to boycott the film because of this, as well as due to the fact that we have yet to have a female lead in a MCU movie. While, yes, it's sad that Janet is gone in this, I can safely say that Wasp DOES get a very heroic moment (via a flashback).  And Hope is a great character who is, by no means, a damsel in distress. She can more than hold her own in a fight, and if you stay till after the credits, I'm happy to say that I'm more than confident we ARE getting Wasp in a future installment.  So to anyone who was boycotting this film for this reason, PLEASE reconsider. Not only are you missing out on a great movie, but we might not get Wasp at all if this film doesn't do well enough.

About the only nitpick I have with this is the villain. The plot is very similar to the first Ironman movie, in that it follows the ""hero must fight an evil businessman who has a similar super suit"" routine. (In fact, thinking about it, the MCU films all sort of follow this blueprint, whether it's Hulk fighting an ""evil Hulk/Abomination"", or Captain America fighting an ""evil super solider/Red Skull""). But the ""commanding ants"" and ""shrinking and growing"" angle gives it a fresh twist.  We also get some surprise cameos from no less than three characters from the Captain America movies (won't spoil who, though.  Four, if you count the post credits scene). And the visuals are both breathtaking and, sometimes, downright hilarious. (If you remember a certain trailer with a certain tank engine in it...)

Part superhero and part heist film, this movie, along with Ironman and Guardians of the Galaxy, has become one of my favorite entries in the MCU. This is a movie that knew it was taking on a bit of a hokey character, and not only made him cool, but downright fun. I highly recommend it.",1437177600,2,6064,4.54029304029304
7281998,3,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Ant-Man was a disappointing finale to Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe(Shouldn't Avengers: Age of Ultron be the Phase 2 finale?) but it's still a fun enough movie in it's own right.
I think the problem with Ant-Man is that the ground they cover, while new for a Marvel movie, is not at all new when it comes to movies in general. From the plot, which features people shrinking and interacting with Ants(""Honey, I Shrunk the kids"") and a former criminal who wants to go straight but ends up getting pulled out of retirement back into being a criminal(""The Godfather Part 3"" is the first film that comes to mind) to the character dynamics, which features a father who want's to spend time with his kid but can't because of his estranged ex-wife(""The Fighter"", for starters) and an old man filled with regrets who has to reconnect with their estranged child(I don't know where to begin with that one.) The whole heist feels pretty routine and by the books too.(They face a lot of obstacles, have to figure out a new way to do things at the last minute, once they get in there's a problem, etc.)
The plot was kind of dumb at times, like Scott braking back into Pym's house to return the suit. WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU RETURN IT?! Throw it out! Or burn it if your afraid of someone finding it in the trash!
Also, I had mixed feelings about the character of Darren Cross. The character starts out with promise and was an initially refreshing character, as he has an interesting backstory and compelling reasons for doing what he wants to do. As the film goes on though, he just becomes another obsessed mad scientist that we've all seen before.
Overall, this was a fun movie though. I liked the action, acting, humor, Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins/cameos/cliffhangers, and most of all, the whole visual design was really cool. I would recommend seeing this one in 3D!
Corey Stoll is brilliant as Darren Cross! He was a real scene stealer. Evangeline Lilly is really great as Hope! Michael Douglas was also really good as Hank Pym! Also, Michael Pea was hilarious as Luis! He had me laughing hysterically from the first scene he's in!
Overall, Ant-Man isn't the Guardians of the Galaxy of 2015, but it's still a good movie.",1437177600,3,2226,4.623737373737374
7281999,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"ANT-MAN has never been on Marvel's A list in the same way as The Hulk, Captain America, Iron Man, and Thor; but neither is he on the same level as Moon Knight.  The character is essential to the comic book version of The Avengers, and a stand alone film introducing him to the cinematic Marvel Universe is quite appropriate.  And if the movie does not swing for the fences in the same way as the first AVENGERS film or last year's GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, it certainly tells its story of with wit, charm and just the right amount of action and special effects.

ANT-MAN is an origin story, which some critics mistakenly believe is the easiest to tell; there have been two heroes to call themselves Ant-Man, the first being Hank Pym, a scientific genius who develops the suit which will allow a man to shrink to the size of an insect, while the second is Scott Lang, a guy who has done a stretch for B&E into a greedy corporation, but who also possesses a Masters in Electrical Engineering. The movie is the story of the latter, who learns from original how to master the suit and the science in order to stop Darren Cross, Pym's former protege, who is planning to sell the Ant-Man technology to Hydra.

The first hour of the movie is filled with exposition, introduction, and set up, but it's done in a way that doesn't drag the movie down and make it feel like forever until the action starts up.  We learn about Hank Pym and why is estranged from his former colleagues and daughter; we get to know Scott Lang, just out of prison and weighted down with a lot of back due child support.  And we see Darren Cross racing to perfect what Pym has already discovered, but has hidden away from the world.  Over the course of the movie, these three story strands become entwined, eventually leading to the inevitable showdown between Ant-Man and his mirror opposite, Yellow Jacket.

As with all good super hero movies, the story works on more than one level.  In one way, ANT-MAN is a heist film, with Scott Lang recruited by an elder to steal from the villains before something bad occurs; there is more than one scene that could have been lifted right out of a classic caper film-think OCEAN'S ELEVEN with super powers.  In another way it is the story of family and the bonds that hold and break with the unintended consequences of both: Scott wants to provide for his daughter and keep her love now that she has a new step dad in her life; Hank Pym has had a strained relationship with his own daughter, who is resentful about events in the past concerning her deceased mother; Darren Cross is the rejected son of Hank, while Scott is his worthy replacement.

The casting and acting is spot on, starting with Paul Rudd in the title part; after all his roles in Apatow comedies, he would seem to be a odd choice to play a super hero, but they may have the single one he was born to play. Marvel's heroes have so often been average guys endowed with extraordinary abilities through incredible circumstances; Rudd is the personification of this classic character, especially in the scenes where he is trying to master the Ant-Man suit and his new powers.  Up till now, Rudd has never been the big star he should have been, hope this movie changes that.  Michael Douglas is perfect as Hank Pym, a once arrogant genius, now humbled by loss; Douglas's bigger than life persona and acting style is just what this role requires.  Darren Cross's Yellow Jacket is a Marvel staple-the protege gone bad and Cory Stoll plays the part well.  Evangeline Lilly is Pym 's daughter, who may be destined to become the second Wasp, and having an actor from LOST fits right in to the cast.  Michael Pena is always a welcome presence in any movie, here he plays one of Scott's friends from prison who comes to play a vital part in the action.  Anthony Mackie's Falcon from the last Captain America movie shows up when Scott tries to break into the Avengers HQ and they have a terrific and very funny fight.  Hayley Atwill shows up as and older Peggy Carter, as does John Slattery, playing Howard Stark in a flashback.

The special effects are good without being overpowering, they are used in clever ways to show the unique powers Ant-Man and Yellow Jacket have-like a battle to the death on a toy train set or throw down inside a tumbling brief case.

One of the best things about ANT-MAN is its lighter tone, this is not the X-Men or Spider-Man with their weighty themes of guilt and redemption; director Peyton Reed, who took over for Edgar Wright, does a good job of telling a story about a super hero who really enjoys being a super hero.  And I don't miss all those time travel and alternate universe paradoxes from the X-Men films one bit.  And listen for the references to the Hulk and Spider-Man.

Of course there are a couple of post credit scenes that advance the story along and set things in motion for the next Marvel movie; the most significant one here, ties up a loose end from WINTER SOLDIER and gets the action rolling for CIVIL WAR.

7282000,5,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Ant-Man is a character I have no investment in, but because of Marvel's cinematic track record, I went opening day. It's a great movie! They perfectly balance humor, action and more surprisingly, a really great story of family. It's the father-son/ father-daughter stories layered through-out the characters that is the movie's real strength. Everybody in the movie is very strong. The way the movie fits into the Marvel Universe is also really impressive. And the shrinking effects! They're great! It's just a really fun movie. I can't recommend it enough.",1437177600,,557,5.2
7282001,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Last year, the Marvel-Disney union scored a gargantuan hit with Guardians of the Galaxy, a bright and zany space opera set in a distant corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the shared space dominated by such flagship heroes as Captain America and Iron Man.  In general, Ant-Man has a similar spirit:  the story of a thief with a heart of gold (Paul Rudd) and his discovery of a suit which can transform a man into an insect-sized soldier, it is a type of outlandish Marvel side note.  And it is an entertaining film, escapist by nature and light as a feather at its best, though it falls short of Guardians of the Galaxy for a few reasons.  The references to the central storyline of the overarching franchise, including a shoehorned-in fight with a second-string Avenger, are more strained; there is a certain cut-rate-serialized-television quality to every scene mentioning S.H.I.E.L.D. or Hydra.  And while Rudd is a charismatic presence, lacing the heartfelt heroism with moments of deadpan humor, he cannot top the magic of the Guardians' combined chemistry even with the help of a game Michael Douglas (exuding cool authority as a curmudgeon slash mentor), a fetching Evangeline Lilly, and a few others.

On the plus side, no prior Marvel film's action-and-suspense set pieces have amused, fascinated, and riveted me as much as the ant-scale chases and fights here.  I simply never grew tired of the neat and wondrous spectacle of an ultra-minute Rudd riding atop a winged ant, clinging to a speeding toy train, etc.  And while his antagonistic character is nothing speciala chip-on-his-shoulder corporate fiend who scowls and blandly gestures toward his evil master-plan while awaiting an inevitable third-act vanquishingCorey Stoll's Darren Cross has the most chic and menacing costume of any cinematic-universe heavy to date, and this instantly renders him more memorable than such dullards as Thor: The Dark World's Malekith or the Winter Soldier.",1437177600,2,1961,5.16403785488959
7282002,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"I think Marvel was smart to de-escalate for their next movie. As it is, Ant-Man is gonna be sandwiched in between Avengers: Age of Ultron and Cap 3, two grandiose blockbusters. Ant-Man gives us a chance to breathe a bit. There were more question marks about this project than on the Riddler's costume. Can an obscure comic book figure with shrinkage power and a silly name make a dent in moving pictures? Are we over that break-up with Edgar Wright? Yeah, man, I was nervous. And, yet, Ant-Man pulls it off. This is a badass movie. It's a heist caper with healthy doses of humor. But there's space enough for a grip of heartfelt moments and character development.

I appreciate that Michael Douglas gets to do more than play the crusty, old mentor who's shuffled off to the side halfway thru the film. Hank Pym is very much an active presence in the narrative. And, on a larger scale, what they do with Hank Pym opens up the MCU for prequel films. Evangeline Lilly is fantastic as the estranged daughter, Hope Pym, and all signs point towards her kicking even more butt in the MCU. Folks were scoffing Paul Rudd's being tapped as Ant-Man (""What, that comedy guy?""). But he's perfectly cast as Scott Lang. Rudd is simply a likable, self-deprecating dude with a bit of a dork in him. He makes Scott really relatable, despite that Scott's an ex-con with three years in San Quentin under his belt. But as we see early on, what motivates him is his love for his little daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson). It kills him that he's not allowed to spend more time with her, that he can't pay child support, seeing as how he can't keep a job because of his jailbird record.

So, Scott Lang has a Masters in electrical engineering, just one part of a catalogue of knowledge that makes him the boss when it comes to orchestrating and executing a heist. I like that they keep the story conflict a personal one. Pym's ambitious ex-protg, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), is on the verge of duplicating the Pym Particles, on the verge of making available to shady agencies the Yellowjacket, an ""all-purpose peacekeeping vessel"" that you and I instinctively know will only jack up the world. When Pym is unable to talk Cross into keeping the genie in the bottle, the heist is on, babe, to steal the Yellowjacket.

At the end of the day, Ant-Man weathered the storm, and it smashed my expectations. It's a tasty blend of action and humor (damn, Michael Pea!!!), of heart and character dynamics and of jaw-dropping f/x (the micro-photography looks amazing). Even the film score was fun. At its heart, it's a personal story about daughters and their wayward fathers. It's a movie that makes you care for a friggin' ant, for Anthony's sake! And, for once, here's a movie that addresses why these guys just don't call in the Avengers.

My two nags: Once again, the big bad becomes an afterthought. I did like that there's an explanation for why Cross is so dickish. But Baskin Robbins made for a better adversary. Nag two is that I wish there were more scenes with Scott and his ridiculously adorable little girl.

My favorite line? It has to be ""Baskin Robbins always finds out.""

7282004,4,B00ZGDIGZ2,"Despite Ant-Man being a superhero/heist film it's one of Marvels best. It has great exchanges between Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly. With great mini-sized action and excellent visuals.
  Corey Stoll's villain character Darren Cross is my only problem with the film. He feels like Jeff Bridges' Obadiah Stane from Ironman again. He's bald like Stane and makes his own suit like Stane. And holds a grudge because his mentor Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) didn't share his shrinking technology with him. When Stane was mad Stark didn't share his Iron suit technology with him.
  Well you get the point; the villain could have been better. Spoiler: Plus I almost expected Evangeline Lilly to say ""next time baby"" about being Wasp ""lol."" Like Rhodes in the first Ironman.
