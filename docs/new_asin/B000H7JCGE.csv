2630725,5,B000H7JCGE,"Finally

One of my favorite shows

from my teen years is

being released on dvd

I am stoked. You see

back in 1992 at age 16

I had yet to ""hook"" a

real girlfriend so this show

was the closest thing to having

one..Thank you Josie Bissett!

I have only 1 small concern though

I have a feeling that

we are going to be cheated

out of  all that all to

important 1990's music

that can be heard in every episode.

It will probably be replaced

by some instrumental knock-off's

Can somone please let us

know for sure so

that we may brace ourselves!",1159747200,2,553,4.125
2630726,5,B000H7JCGE,"It's been proven that Melrose Place was not really started as a primetime soap but rather as a daytime soap with good acting and just dealing with relationship issues.  The primetime soap element from the late ""Dallas"" or the more recent ""Desperate Housewives"" began more or less at the start of Season Two.  However Season One introduces the characters and contains Vanessa Williams, which is more than enough incentive to buy it.

I have not seen every single episode, i've only seen about 30 to be honest, but i'm a big fan of Marcia Cross and Desperate Housewives and now a big Melrose fan.  I have already pre-ordered a copy and wish that i knew the release date of Season Two!!!  Get it, it'll be well worth while!",1159401600,,720,4.59375
2630727,5,B000H7JCGE,"Well this was a blessing waiting to happen.  I feel like a kid on Christmas morning.  I'm so excited they FINALLY decided to release Melrose Place on DVD.  I mainly loved the show when Dr. Kimberly Shaw started going crazy, that was the best.  Anyway, I can't wait to get ALL the seasons!",1156723200,6,288,4.377358490566038
2630728,5,B000H7JCGE,"This is a really good show. Why? Well its camp, in the beginning this show TRIED to take it serious, it did not work, it needed trash, scandal, sex, deception, murder, sex, lies, sex, more sex. What Dynasty was for the 80's, Melrose was for the 90's! Pure Adulterated Fun, Eventually you can tell everyone is in on the joke ""pretending to be a VERY Serious show WITH Serious issues"". What I like about this show is that they are twentysomethings , thirtysomethings and IT WORKED no excuses no apologies, it could be done because your old enough to do so.",1156204800,4,554,4.4950495049504955
2630729,5,B000H7JCGE,"I remember the hype surrounding this show when it first aired and I remember staying glued to the television each Friday night to watch.  It certainly lived up to the hype and it was always the talk around the water cooler.

The show is focused around the apartment complex of a group of 8 late 20 somethings and the lives they all lead.  In the pilot we meet Alison Parker (Courtney Thorne Smith) who looks for a new roomate; enter Billy (Andrew Shue).  There is also Michael Mancini (Thomas Calabro) the bad boy who is the building manager and a doctor.  His wife Jane (Jossie Bisset) seems like a quiet demure girl - and owns her own clothing boutique.  There is Matt Fielding (Doug Savant) who is gay with a best friend Rhonda (Vanessa Williams) and the gorgeous Jake Hanson (Grant Show) who we see trying to get rid of Kelly Taylor (where this spin off from 90210 begins) who he had been dating.

Through the years you see so many people come and go, and while this honestly is a trashy show, it's a trashy show in the good sense.  It's adictive (you always want to know who is sleeping with who) and extremely soapy.

Here is the way the first season goes:

1  Pilot

2  Friends and Lovers

3  Lost and Found

4  For Love Of Money

5  Leap Of Faith

6  Second Chances

7  My Way

8  Lonely Hearts

9  Responsibly Yours

10 Burned

11 A Promise Broken

12 Polluted Affairs

13 Dreams Come True

14 Drawing The Line

15 House Of God

16 The Whole Truth

17 Jake vs Jake

18 A Melrose Place Christmas

19 Single White Sister

20 Peanut Butter and Jealousy

21 Picture Imperfect

22 Three's A Crowd

23 My New Partner

24 Bye Bye Billy

25 Irreconcilable Similarities

26 End Game

27 The Test

28 Pushing Boundaries

29 Pas de Trois

30 Carpe Diem

31 State Of Need

32 Suspicious Minds

Alison is a bit annoying...she tells Billy that he cant date Amanda because she's her boss and she wants to keep her home and work life separate, but why did she agree to go with Amanda to her dad's lake house?

I really like the storyline/relationship of Rhonda Blair and Terrence. I like how they met and how he was rich, but she didn't know at first. Just when that started to get good, they take the Rhonda character away! Interestingly enough, ""Rhonda"" and ""Terrence"" married each other in real life in 2007...wow.

This show makes for great nostalgia...hair scrunchies, answering machines, LA Riot, AIDS (not that that doesn't still exist..)

2630855,4,B000H7JCGE,"Ok, so the first half of this season I had to force myself to watch. I loved Amy Locane's character, however, and I wish that the people that be had decided to keep her on. I agree with others who think she was one of the strongest of the original cast. Story line-wise, the first half of the season was full of overly average storytelling. Very much yawn worthy material. Then Sandy (Amy Locane) left the show and things started to pick up gradually. I was a little unsure when the character of Jo Reynolds was first brought on; her first few appearances were a little sketchy. But after a while, I fell in love with her!

Then the baddest b*$#h of all came on board in the form of a little character called Amanda Woodward. Even early on, she was delicious and really added some spice to the doldrums that were Billy and Allison. One of my favorite season one quotes, here: Allison: ""Amanda, why are you bringing so many suitcases?"" Amanda: ""Unlike you, Allison, I don't have the ability to make one outfit work four different ways."" Hahaha, classic.

By the end of the season, they had kicked off Vanessa Williams, (who, in my opinion, simply had to go. She was just too nice for Melrose Place.) and story lines had really started getting soapy. To sum up, it's more than worth it to sit through EVERY season one episode. I had so much fun watching the character of Michael transform from doting and loving husband to a lecherous pig and Allison gets a nice story twist in the form of a psychotic married man.

2630861,5,B000H7JCGE,"Do you remember this super-cool 90210 spin-off? I sure do. I loved this show. Although, like many fans I didn't start watching until the mid-second season. When I used to watch repeats of the first season I never really enjoyed it. Because it was so different from the rest of the series (it's sorta like the difference between the first season of ""The Facts of Life"" compared to the rest of that series.) There were different characters and the stories were nowhere near over-the-top. There was no trashy sex or backstabbing. Although, now when I watch the first season I have a whole new fondness for this show. It's almost like looking at baby pictures of an old friend. She may have looked like an ""ugly duckling"" but I know that she's gonna turn out to be a knock-out!

I like to think of the first season of ""Melrose"" more as 3 mini-seasons. Because the entire first season is rather diverse and unique. I suppose the producers and writers (not to mention the actors and actresses) were still trying to find their way (i. e. make the show a hit,) which made them retool it more than once during that first faithful season. Let's see... There's the Sandy Era (Amy Locane,) which is the shortest of all season one's mini-seasons. This only lasted 14 eps (technically, 12 since the pilot is actually 1 ep and Sandy wasn't on the ep prior to her last one.) Then there's The Jo Reynolds (Daphne Zuniga) Era, which picks up right after Sandy leaves for NY (actually, 1 ep later.) The Jo Reynolds Era takes us through the end of '92 and the beginning of '93 which is also the start of the third and final season 1 mini-season. Then God said, ""let there be Heather"" and a ""special Guest Star"" was born! Of course, I'm talking about Amanda Woodward (Heather Locklear) who totally assisted in transforming season 1 into it's final incarnation, The Amanda Era!

The Sandy Era was when we got introduced to the entire cast (or should I say residents?) of 4616 Melrose Place. There was Billy Campbell (Andrew Shue) and Allison Parker (Courtney Thorne-Smith,) the building's sweet and sometimes homely roommates. Dr. Michael (Thomas Calabro) and Jane Mancini (Josie Bissett) were almost like the parents of the apartment. They were like an old married couple that everyone came to for help or advice; after all they were married for almost a whole 2 years! There was the resident hearthrob and cool loner, Jake Hanson (Grant Show.) As you may recall, Jake parlayed his tie-in role on ""90210"" first. In the first few eps of ""Melrose"" Jake could often be seen shooing away Kelly Taylor (Jenny Garth.) Then there was Matt Fielding (Doug Savant,) who really didn't have much to say or do during season one. Although this was one of the first times that an (openly) g-a-y character ever had a recurring role on an American coast-to-coast series. The only thing unbelievable about the character of Matt was his sense of style. Wouldn't you think a g-a-y man living in West Hollywood would understand the importance of fashion and dressing well a little better? (It makes me gag to think that poor Matt wore that hideous sandal-sock combo more than once.) Rhonda Blair (Vanessa Williams, not the Miss America) was the sexy, outspoken resident in this trendy building. During The Sandy Era her character was very well developed and we got to know Rhonda rather well; she was a sweet and sexy fitness instructor (teaching ""cardio funk."") And, finally completing The Sandy Era was none other than Sandy Louise Harling (Amy Locane.) Sandy we hardly knew ya! Sanda is sorta like the Lana Shields of ""Melrose Place"" because she seemed so sexy, yet rather sexually frusterated. Sandy was an aspiring actress, who got her ""big break"" and left 4616 for the bright lights of the Big Apple to star on ""Forever & Tomorrow."" My favorite episode with Sandy is ""Lonely Hearts."" This is the one when she gets stalked. I always thought that Sandy and Jake would have made a great couple, and they did date, but nothing ever came of it. And, before we got a good chance to get to know her she was gone! Halfway through The Sandy Era, it also seemed that this mini-season was slightly retooled. Did you notice how the stories started to get more serious, however insignificant; Jane's pregnancy, Alison's married lover and Billy's attack.

The Jo Reynolds Era is when the series was completely retooled. Gone were the pool parties, barbecues, friendly chats in the laundry room, group parties and fun-loving get-togethers. The arrival of Jo brought a whole new concept to this soapy drama. The eps got more grittier and serious. I also enjoyed Jo because she was like a breath of fresh air. Jo was very beautiful and always managed to add a bit of common sense to the storylines. In the very beginning (for her first and maybe even second ep,) she had somewhat of a rough exterior. But that was just a facade because Jo was petrified of letting people into her life. Once I got to know Jo, I found a new resident at this complex that was just as likeable (if not more,) than all the others! During this mini-season, we learn that Jake has an estranged son. And another aspect that I noticed was that Rhonda was now being fazed out. Did you notice that Rhonda almost only exclusively had dialogue with Matt or with Terrence Haggard (John Marshall Jones,) who was her future hubby? Also during The Jo Reynolds Era we got to meet some more supporting/recurring cast members. Dr. Kimberly Shaw's (Marcia Cross) character was more developed. You may remember that she actaully spent X-Mas with the other tenants at ""Melrose!"" And we got to meet Jane's pesky little sister, Sydney Andrews (Laura Leighton.) Although, not much was really learned about Syd during The Jo Reynolds Era, except for the fact that she was obviously a bottle redhead during season 2!

The Amanda Season was the final and very best mini-season of ""Melrose's"" season 1 because the storylines got so much deeper and more serious. The actors were also much more polished and they seemed more confident. As it's been said many times before, Amanda Woodward was what ""Melrose"" was all about! She really helped make this show! During this era, we saw a rather entertaining love-triangle develop between Billy, Alison and Amanda. Of course that was after Alison left her on-again/off-again lover, Keith Gray (William R. Moses.) (Keith is actually introduced to Alison during The Sandy Era, but the most interesting eps with him are during The Amanda Era.) Alison even quit her job and moved to Seattle to be with Keith! I loved it when Amanda said to Alison, ""and when it was obvious that Billy wasn't going to run to Seattle to chase after you you came back!"" During this time, the character of Lucy Cabot (Deborah Adair) was also more prominently seen. Yes, Lucy was the typical cliche of the ""modern American professional lady"" but she also showed a lot of compassion to Alison. During this era, Jake and Jo have an AIDS scare when one of Jake's former lovers contracts the virus. We also got to see another transformation during The Amanda Season. This was when Jane and Michael's marriage started to unravel. It was also around this time that Michael turned into the sneaky snake that he was known for in following seasons. Of course Michael carried on an illicit affair with Kimberly. And when Alison confronted him (she caught the 2 kissing at the hospital,) he arragantly said to Jane, ""this is just malicious gossip."" By the way, am I the only one who thought Michael was much more sexier when he was nice? I never found him attractive in following seasons because he just came off as such a dirty cheat.

Everyone always talks about Billy and how he was such a dreamboat. I tend to disagree. I was never crazy about Billy. To me, he seemed like a big kid who was still somewhat immature. My ""Melrose"" dreamboat was Jake. Jake was the perfect man because he was the perfect balance of sweet and tough. Remember how he cared for Matt and took him to the hospital during the ""Dreams Come True"" ep; I loved it when the cop assumed that Jake was Matt's lover and Jake said, ""he's not my lover"" because Jake would have done this for anyone.

By the way, look for Joyce Hyser in the ""Responsibly Yours"" ep. In this show she played Dawn Bonds, Billy's new girlfriend; a single mother who was tying to ignite her stand-up comedy career. Of course all children of the '80s remember Joyce Hyser as Terry in Just One of the Guys!

Another season 1 character who I enjoyed was Joan Campbell (Salome Jens.) Even though Mrs. Campbell (Billy's mom) was hardly seen, she always managed to make a big splash. She almost reminded of Bea Arthur a little. And Joan absolutely loved Alison. Seeing Joan on season 1 always reminds me of Billy's second marriage to Samantha Reilly (Brooke Langton.) (I never could stand Billy's second wife, I probably hated her the most out of all the ""Melrose"" girls.) Anywho, during the reception, Joan had a little too much to drink (after all, it's a party, right!) and the old thing starts shooting her mouth off to Samantha telling her about Alison and how much she always liked her. Then Joan brings up Billy's first wife, Brooke (played by none other than Kristen Davis whom I love!!) which caused Samantha to really pout. And Joan said to Samantha in her husky Greta Garbo voice, ""don't tell me I can't talk about Brooke now.""

""Melrose Place"" really was the very best nighttime soap. In my humble opinion it was way better than ""Dynasty"" and even the granddaddy of all nighttime soaps, ""Dallas"" because all the stories and characters were always so captivating (even during season 1!) If you want to see how it all began, I recommend getting season 1, you won't be disappointed! ...Remember, you are what you watch!",1205625600,3,9773,4.691142191142191

Some a little more ""out there"" than others, but somehow the curiosity was always there for the next week.  With very little TV shows worth watching these days, it's great to watch my Melrose Place once again.",1196640000,2,492,4.556818181818182
2630865,4,B000H7JCGE,"I remember being 12 years old and watching Melrose Place in the other room, just hoping my mother wouldn't catch me. Since it took so long to come to DVD, I could never really remember why I felt that the viewing had to be so clandestine, only that it was a matter of the utmost importance. Finally, more than a decade later, Melrose Place is on DVD and I have my answer. I was way too young to be watching a show about secret abortions, office romances, gay bashing, and stalkers. But still, 15 years later, Melrose Place has lost none of its charm, though this first season is a little more PG-rated than the way the show would eventually turn out.

Melrose Place is the story of a group of young 20-somethings who live in a hip building, including pool, in West Hollywood. The building is managed by Jane and Michael Mancini, a married couple who just moved to LA from Chicago so that Michael could begin his residency. Jane is an aspiring fashion designer and Michael, of course, a doctor. These two have issues with everything from pregnancy to infidelity, and are the one so-called solid couple in the building. Next we have Allison Parker, a receptionist at an advertising agency whose roommate moves out in the dark of night, sticking Allison with the rent. Desperate to find a new roommate, Allison agrees to live with Billy Campbell, a struggling writer and taxi driver. The sexual tension between these two is what drives most of the show and their drama is what leads to the entrance of bombshell Amanda Woodward, played by Heather Locklear, the pinch hitter of failing TV shows. The rest of the cast is mainly just supporting characters, including Rhonda, a fitness instructor whose wardrobe alone is reason enough to watch this show, Matt, the token gay character, and Jake, the dark, handsome stranger who almost led 90210's Kelly astray.

Melrose Place has lost none of its charm over the years, and I can't wait to pick up the second season. Though this season is a bit more vanilla than I remember it ending, it's still worthwhile. It's a lot more fun to come home and watch other people lament about the woes of being in their 20's (credit card/student loan debt, navigating the relationship minefield, should friends become lovers) than to deal with my own 20-something drama. I would definitely recommend Melrose Place if you're in the mood for a blast from the past and a few nights in with some trashy television.",1185667200,,2436,4.675990675990676

2630868,4,B000H7JCGE,"I bought this DVD because I ~ apparently unlike many other buyers ~ thought the first season was the best; especially the first half of the first season.  Back when it addressed what it was like to move across the country, or just out on your own, after college and the professional, social, and financial issues we faced in doing so.  After Season One, Melrose Place went from being touching and meaningful to being yet another nighttime soap (albeit a fun one).

If you want the suds and catfights, stick to later seasons.  If you want the wonderful friendships along with some drama ~ and a reminder of those wonderful and terrifying times ~ definitely buy this DVD set.",1172707200,2,673,4.630252100840337

2630879,5,B000H7JCGE,"A lot of people in their reviews are stressing this is the worst season of Melrose Place and this just is not so.  All shows, especially the best, usually begin with a particular format and are quickly tinkered with to become the classics they are.

That is the case with Melrose.  You have some oharacters who just don't fit - like Sandy and (Rhonda in particular).  But they are removed throughout the first season and you are slowly introduced to the personalities of the prime players.  Allison, Billy, Jane and Michael.

To say it only starts with season 2 is ludicrous for Heather Locklear (Amanda) is in 8 episodes in season 1 and to miss this would be crucial.  For me Courtney Thorne-Smith was always the glowing part of this show.  Everything imaginable happens to her and she is such fun to watch.  Her catfights with Amanda are legendary.

Heather Locklear is great and perfectly cast but when she was added was also when they started to spice up the action and characters.  They go hand in hand.

To go into specifics of all the drama to come would be a kill for those new to the show.  Just believe me - it is AWESOME and ADDICTIVE.  No other show like it.  And it really isn't a spinoff of 90210.  That is a stretch.  This season 1 is a MUST and it is fun to see the early slower episodes as the characters develop.  Also, as I said, the action does begin near the end of this season.

ENJOY and I LOVE my Courtney Thorne-Smith!!",1165622400,4,1444,4.381132075471698

The pace in season 1 is increddiibbllyy slllo[...] I don't know MP as well as I know 90210, so I am not sure if these dvds are made with parts of scenes missing like the 90210 ones are.  It's cool to see the spin off from 90210.  my roommate who has never watched MP before watches the dvds with me and seems to like them.

I think they should have released the SECOND SEASON first, and would have had much stronger sales.  I LOVE MELROSE PLACE,  except for this season.  That being said, I purchased it anyway, for the Last 12 or so episodes of the FIRST SEASON, which include Amanda, and which are more dramatic than the original premise of the show....The show didn't really take off until Season 2, in any case.",1163635200,8,745,4.621212121212121
2630883,5,B000H7JCGE,"The First Season Of Melrose Place is about 8 twentysomethings living in LA. Jake was your typical Bad Boy on a motorcycle every time you turned around, but he did have a generous heart. Alison was morally superior good girl who always struggled with lifes challenges. Billy, her roomate and a writer, was a tad bit goofy, but very loyal to his friends. Matt, the only gay character, was constantly battling tough issues like inner city violent kids, and his own mugging. Rhonda, the only person of color, was the fun, energetic, and talkative neighbor. Sandy, her roomate, was the southern girl who aspired to be a waitress and wanted to become an actress. Micheal and Jane were the only  married couple on the show. They were the perfect example of a young married couple dealing with distance, miscarriages, and affairs.

The show dealt with a hot issue of the week for most of the season. Dealing with Billy Getting Robbed. Matt Getting Mugged. Alison getting Sexually Harassed at work. Jane debating an Abortion. Sandy being Stalked. Jake being the bad boy that never called Kelly (90210).

Then Sandy left, she got her big break in NY on a fake Soap Opera. Rhonda got married and moved away.

Jo Reynolds moved in to Sandy and Rhondas old apartment. She was the female version of Jake. Secret past, and lived to be alone. So its no wonder the two hit it off.

Amanda came in as Alisons boss, who had a thing for Billy, and would later on become the new owner of The Building.

Sydney showed up for a few episodes as Janes younger annoying sister who dropped out of school.

And Kimberly made a few apperances as a shoulder for Micheal to lean on at work. Working long and hard hours at the hospital, led these two to share some more than just a scalpel.

Eventually, the show, a carbon copy of Beverly Hills 90210, became something all of its own. Very Tawdry and one hell of a Guilty Pleasure.",1163462400,,1899,4.548387096774194

2630887,4,B000H7JCGE,"The first season of this show was pretty shaky, they were experimenting with some things that didn't really work too well and were promptly jettisoned.  It was a bit like Beverly Hills 90210 in that they occasionally tried throwing some politically correct themes into the mix.  I think they finally figured out that this show was attracting a slightly older audience than 90210, and preaching to them like they were a bunch of brainless teenyboppers wasn't going to work.  Thankfully this stuff was completely abandoned and the ratings skyrocketed.  Once it got going, I think the series was absolutely fantastic around the middle part of its run - those battles between Amanda and Allison were memorable, with poor Billy always stuck in between.  The shenanigans between Jane and Sydney were always high in entertainment value as well.  And when Kimberly blew up the whole apartment building, it was the season finale to end all season finales!  But it went downhill towards the end.  That god-awful Southern Belle Lexi and pathetic alcoholic Kyle really grated on a person's nerves.

Of course, this stuff all happens in later seasons.  The first season is certainly quite watchable and entertaining.  The main appeal comes from the fact that these people are  beautiful yuppies, living in a glamorous apartment complex in LA, dating all the glamorous people and doing all those glamorous things that we all want to do.  It wasn't completely over the top fantasy like Dallas or Dynasty, what these people had was actually achievable by the average person.  In that fashion, it's the perfect escape for all of us folks who just live normal, less-than-glamorous lives.",1162771200,14,1669,5.043795620437956
2630888,2,B000H7JCGE,"The first season they started it out as 20-somethings trying to make it in LA near the trendy ""Melrose Place,"" but issue shows didn't really pull people in so they jetisoned the lesson of the week for the trashy soap and it sure was fun for about 5 years, until Darren Star left to create Sex and the City.

I could be wrong but I don't even think Amanda (Heather Locklear) even showed up until the 2nd season and same with Jo (Daphne Zuniga).

By the end, just as 90210 before it, most of the cast had left and most of the characters that you hoped would end up together like Billy and Allison and Jake and Jo were gone. All these new characters weren't very interesting and the show turned into a parody of itself.

I give the first season a 2 because it didn't start getting good until the second season.",1162512000,,807,4.261437908496732
