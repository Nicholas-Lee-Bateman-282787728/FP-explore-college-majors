He's a little bit of a history nut and it is a very enlightening perspective into the man Christians despise.  It is not really biased at all, it goes into great depth about his fantastic architectural feats and what he overcame to be king as well as his insanity and acts against mankind.  My children go to Catholic School and so I think it important to understand the whole story of the characters of the Bible and to understand the circustances surrounding major religious happenings.  This as well as the other A&E Mysteries of the Bible collection provide that in a very captivating way.",1155427200,3,684,4.628099173553719
