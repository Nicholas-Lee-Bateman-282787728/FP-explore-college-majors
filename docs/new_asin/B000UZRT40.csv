2927952,5,B000UZRT40,The set is beautiful and the instructor is very personable.  I have learned a lot about the wide range of things I can do with my veil!,1200787200,3,135,4.0
2927953,5,B000UZRT40,"I had fallen into a rut with the same boring veil moves and needed some new tricks. This video was just what I was looking for at an affordable price! Learn beautiful cascades, wraps, turns, traveling steps and more. Also featured: Sarah goes over different veils by shape, size and fabric. She also discusses what to do when your veil ""misbehaves"" and a mishap occurs. Very thorough DVD with nice clear instruction.",1200614400,7,416,4.791666666666667
2927954,5,B000UZRT40,"Just loved this one! I was looking for veil instruction and Sarah came through beautifully.  The DVD was well written, well presented and well rehearsed. Sarah covers veil materials (very important for movement) moves slowly through the combos, thoroughly explains them while breaking  them down then sets them to music so you get the idea of how the combo flows in a choreography. She also puts all of the combos into a dance at the end so you can see how everything works. This one is a keeper and I would recommend it to anyone looking for veil instruction.",1200614400,25,560,4.646464646464646
2927955,4,B000UZRT40,Sarah is very good at giving directions and then putting together little routines for their use while belly dancing. I love to use the veil while dancing.,1360540800,,154,4.7407407407407405
2927956,5,B000UZRT40,Loved every minute of this video! Get it if you love bellydance it's a must have for your library. She's a wonderful dancer and instructor. Thank you Sarah for a great video.,1298678400,,174,4.46875
2927957,5,B000UZRT40,This is an excelent dvd. The teacher explain all step-by-step. The language used is easy for understand. I'm happy for buy it.,1297382400,,126,4.7727272727272725
2927958,5,B000UZRT40,"I love this DVD! Its a great introduction to veil work, with ranges for beginner to advanced. The first 2/3 is an introduction to veils themselves and moves you can do with them and the last 1/3 is a beautiful choreography that puts them all together.

Ms. Skinner does a wonderful job describing and demonstrating the moves.

The only problem I had with it was during the wrap section. During the descriptions of the moves she would show you how to wrap and then unwrap it, but for the practice there was no time to rewrap it. Easily solved with pausing the DVD of course.",1294012800,,573,4.447619047619048
2927959,5,B000UZRT40,"I really enjoyed this dvd, it is beautifully done and the information provided is very useful. I can't wait to do more with what she shared. Great job on the delivery time and product.",1290297600,,184,4.4411764705882355
2927960,3,B000UZRT40,"This DVD is an encyclopedia of veil technique.  The moves are broken down well into understandable chunks and the sequencing is quite good, well-thought out and organized.  But . . .a major problem is the presenter's babbling.  About every 30 seconds she says something incoherent and obnoxious if you really listen.  She needs a dialog coach or an old-fashioned English teacher to correct things like, ""There is many variations, here is a few.""  She sounds like a grammatically-challenged hillbilly.  Unfortunately the DVD doesn't work without the sound and it is distracting to hear the string of bloopers, you wince and feel like turning it off or throwing something at the TV monitor.

To conclude, if you can ignore the obnoxious bits, buy this DVD for the technique value.",1269907200,10,778,5.03125
2927961,5,B000UZRT40,This is a well put together dvd with information that many dancers acquire after years of dance. The instruction is easy to follow and very straight forward. All dancers would benefit from this instruction.,1263168000,,206,5.088235294117647
2927962,5,B000UZRT40,Sarah Skinner is an excellent instructor.  This video provides detailed explanations and the practice sections are very helpful. I enjoyed learning the veils movements from this instructor and DVD. Production quality is good.,1262044800,,225,5.818181818181818
2927963,5,B000UZRT40,Great veil workshop. I have used several of the moves and combinations in my improvisational dance as well as writing choreography.  Sarah Skinner covers different kinds of veils as well as fabrics and quality to consider when choosing a veil for performance. I use this DVD as a reference guide as well as for technique and combination ideas. Sarah gives clear instruction and variations on moves for personal adaptation.,1261785600,,422,5.115942028985507
2927964,5,B000UZRT40,"Couldn't have asked for more. Excellent instruction and presentation. From beginning to end, a pleasure to watch and learn. Goes at just the right pace with moves broken down then demonstrated. Wonderful instructor showing easy and hard moves. Just takes a bit of practice and you are ready to dance with your veil! Loved the choreography. Includes instructions for how to choose a veil. Nice surprise. You won't lose with this one.",1253577600,,432,5.013888888888889
2927965,5,B000UZRT40,"This production is one of the most information-packed works out there regarding dance with veil.  Ms Skinner begins on stage surrounded by her collection of multi-weighted, colored and varied cuts of cloth.  She talks about the hand, application and possible behavioral considerations in different materials.  I was hungry to see and hear more regarding the properties resulting from different thread counts and strand thickness on a given fabric source such as 5mm silk, or the chiffons.  Her costume discussions are always a pleasure.

Like the other reviewers, I found her figures and combinations refreshingly fun and innovative at times.  Dollar for dollar, you will find the  generous, detailed, program content and instructional competancy presented here well worth the price.",1247529600,4,783,5.529411764705882
2927966,5,B000UZRT40,"I love Sarah!  She's got a very charming, upbeat personality. She knows what she's talking about, and stays true to the passion of the dance throughout the entire DVD.

She not only shows you techniques, but has a dialogue about different veils, entrances, etc.

I would really recommend this product to anyone interested in veil work.",1237420800,,335,4.946428571428571
2927967,5,B000UZRT40,"I purchased this DVD after viewing Turkish Bellydance and I have to say that I found Sarah to be a Great performer and also a very creative costume designer and photographer,all fields familiar to me, viewing her tutorial about veils and techniques where to buy and how to work with them reminded me of my years in Fashion Design classes and she KNOWS her fields very well documented always begins her tutorials with an Historic background and lots of good tips that takes you beyond the DVD itself. The veil work is flawless, mesmerizing and she breaks it down step by step and repeats so you don't feel that you need to be perfect the first time I would recommend this DVD to anyone interested in discovering the mysteries of the veil ...I did and now I want to swish  and dance even with my cortains if they are sheer enough  lol.",1237334400,3,833,4.473684210526316
2927968,5,B000UZRT40,"I LOVED this DVD.  Sarah Skinner covered a large amount of variety of material relating to veil dance.  She talked about everything from selecting the material and size of your veil to basic and more advanced steps, veil mishap recovery, and choreography.  She did a wonderful job breaking down the different moves and given plenty of time to practice each, then putting several moves learned in sequence to really show how to use them for choreography.  She capped it off with a wonderful dance in full costume, then took each part of that apart to teach the viewer, so they would have a complete dance when done.

The only disappointment was that the video technical quality was not so good.  My DVD begin skipping and stopping after viewing only a few times, and did the same on other players/my computer.",1221350400,5,808,4.735714285714286
2927969,5,B000UZRT40,"Learn about what makes a great floating veil.
Now I have a new performance art prop.",1211328000,,84,4.3125
2927970,5,B000UZRT40,"This is a fabulous instructional video.  Please note that it is NOT an ""exercise for weightloss"" type of video, although it will work your arms.  But if you're looking for a strictly weight loss exercise/bellydance type of dvd this isn't it.

I bought Sarah's other dvd when it first came out and loved it, at the end of it there is a performance section and has a veil section in it.  I remember thinking then that it would be great if she'd make a veil video....and here it is!  I hope she keeps coming out with more dvds in the future.  She has much to offer.

If you want to learn about veilwork this is definitely worth the money.  It is well thought out and well done. The section on different types and qualities of fabrics is something I've not been able to find in another video.  It's nice to see the difference in the loft and qualities of the fabrics and to gain an understanding of how they're going to react, especially for someone like me who doesn't have access to bellydance shops and so I cannot try veils before I buy.  There are some great veil ideas and combos, everything from wraps and entrances to the finale is covered.  Finally there is a choreography using the combos you learned earlier.  The mishap recovery section has good ideas on how to turn a mistake into something that looks like it was done on purpose.

My one and only complaint about this dvd is that Sarah is facing you when she instructs and she uses her left and right so you can either follow what she is doing or try and move to your left and right.  I prefer videos where the instructor either mirrors her moves to what I am doing or works in front of a mirror so that I can see the front and back and move the same direction that she is.  Still it's well worth 5 stars.",1208304000,11,1765,4.274096385542169
2927971,5,B000UZRT40,This is a very nice informative DVD and I enjoy it very much.  Good instruction!!,1203984000,,81,4.4
2927972,5,B000UZRT40,This is  the best instructional DVD I have ever purchased...It has created a whole new dimension to my veil dancing...Thank you Sarah...,1202947200,3,136,5.181818181818182
2927973,5,B000UZRT40,"This is the best money I have ever spent on an instructional DVD, and the first time I have been compelled to write a review. I teach belly dance and am always looking for new, fresh ideas. Sarah covers more moves, with more variations than in any other DVD I've bought. They usually offer the same old moves, and I feel I've wasted my money. Sarah offers way more content than what is typical for these instructional DVDs. With this one, not only did I see some moves I never had before, but she shows and breaks down several moves I've never seen outside of a studio situation. She also offers some different variations on some common moves. All of her instruction is clear and easy to follow, but she doesn't spend a huge amount of time on one thing, to the point where you get bored. I only wish that she had a dozen or so videos available! Sarah is a lovely dancer, and if you like to dance with a veil, this is a fantastic addition to any one's dance repertoire.",1202256000,34,968,4.295081967213115
2927974,5,B000UZRT40,"This veil instructional video is rich in content, presented in user friendly fashion, uncovering great veil tricks, basic veil wraps and wonderful rumba steps. The music is incredible and the choreography is a great bonus at the end. Sarah Skinner is awesome, I admire the quality and substance of her work and presentation of material.
In content, this program presents much more than many veil seminars I have attended which focus on the dancer,with few moves or tricks.
This is truly a seminar in itself presented just for you!
 Learn about fabrics
 traveling steps, rumba, basic, arabesque
turning and varying speed
 veil swtiches
 cascades
 veil wraps
ending the dance
recovering the veil during an inapportune mishap
This program is beyond educational, it is enjoyable and rewarding. Find yourself drifting away with your beautiful veil, a pliable, invisible, flowing, dance partner at your command, lured away by the enchanting music of Mr. Burhan Ocal.",1201651200,38,960,5.248366013071895
8215868,5,B000UZRT40,"This is my ""go-to"" video for veil work! Sarah teaches veil from beginner to advanced in this long, wonderful DVD. She breaks down all those complicated tricks that look so impossible to do! If you buy no other veil DVD, buy this one!",1522713600,,233,4.441860465116279

8215875,5,B000UZRT40,"This is one  of a few DVDs that I have purchased for myself and the one I like the most so far. Sarah is very thorough in explaining and breaking down the technique to work with your veil and to apply that into your performance. Every veil section has a short dance where you can see what it looks like to music. Some veil techniques are a little tricky so there is everything here for beginner to advanced dancer. You can really spice up your repertoire with the technique here because it covers more than the basics that you would learn in a regular belly dance class. There is also a handy section about what to do if you have a mishap during performance. This DVD is also filmed with high quality standards and on a real nice setting, not like the crappy ones that keep getting mass produced by popular dancers.",1378771200,,815,4.3618421052631575

8215877,5,B000UZRT40,"I  am new to belly dance and wanted to learn more veil technique.  Found this easy to follow, very informative.  For me, anyway, it was good to be able to replay sections many times to get the move down.",1363910400,,203,4.153846153846154
