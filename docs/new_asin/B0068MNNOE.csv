4977987,5,B0068MNNOE,"Fascinating!
I have, we have heard the rumor all our lives that they plays credited to William Shakespeare were not written by him. they were written by various people.  I never cared. Fodder for scholars? Not here. This is one of the best movies I've seen this year. If you want to see a movie with intellectual depth, suspense, intrigue, this is it.

Why? That is the big question and this movie poses a tantalizing premise of not only who wrote the plays, the Earl of Oxford, but why he wrote them and why he could have had his head loped off if he had signed them. Shakespeare is portrayed as a semi-illiterate patsy, selected by intermediary Ben Johnson, who would go on the be the most beloved poet of his day. I won't give away more plot except to say that the movie implies that nearly ALL of the plays credited to the (supposedly) illiterate Shakespeare were political, portraits about the Elizabethan times, Midsummer's Night, Julius Caesar, King Leer, especially Richard the Third, were all oblique and therefore potentially treasonous commentaries about contemporary Elizabethan court and government figures. What happened to Kit Marlowe? Murder , mystery, intrigue.

This movie presents a really diffferent slant on various semingly unrelated historical events. Whether you agree or not with the author's premise, it's a clever, interesting movie. A different slant.

You have to get used to the available light, candlelight, torchlight shots, and in the beginning the movie jumps back and forth present,  and past and a large cast of character at various stages of their life, but this is a movie you can really get your teeth into. A really different look at Elizabethan times, for those familiar with the subject. Vanessa Redgrave plays a part she has played for the last 40 some years, Elizabeth I, Rhys Ifans plays the Earl of Oxford.  Very Plausible! A contemporary Derek Jacobi comes in at the beginning and end with some shocking Shakespear details.

Highest recommendation. Those tired of superhero movies and rom-coms will find substance here.",1319846400,10,2066,4.988372093023256
4977988,4,B0068MNNOE,"I always accepted the idea that Shakespeare wrote his own plays, and considered anything to the contrary to be merely speculation not fact.  So, the premise-what if Shakespeare never wrote a word, I found not to be appealing.

Upon reading some good reviews, I decided to see it, and found it to be a high quality production and a wonderful experience. Director Roland Emmerich  previously directed 2012, and Independence Day, and writer John Orloff previously wrote some episodes of Band of Brothers, and as you watch this movie you will realise this term  BoB originated with Shakespeare.

Anonymous proposes the Earl of Oxford wrote all the plays, anonymously donated them to Ben Johnson, a well known writer of the time for him to take credit. Then an uncouth illiterate actor, named Shakespeare steps in to claim the credit.  The peer remained anonymous for reasons of social acceptability.

Another reason he may have remained anonymous which I totally loved was the parallel structure between what happened in the plays, and the real life events of the courtiers and Queen Elizabeth. Cecil, the courtier villain in this movie is a hunchback (historical fact), and brother in law of the Earl of Oxford. Richard 3 in Shakespeare's play is a hunchback, so the play becomes a social satire.

A scene where a man is stabbed through a curtain mirrors a scene in Hamlet. A usurped heir is sent to Ireland, and there is a plot to kill him, similar to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in Hamlet.

Emmerich's direction gives Anonymous a much grander scope. We have big set pieces, such as a rebel attack on a bridge leading to the tower of London, rowing a boat in the Thames with the London skyline looming behind, an aerial shot of a huge crowd in the snow, and visual scenes of quite unsanitary London of the time, and he evokes the period very well. For example it rains on the actor in the theater, as he recites his lines.  Certain scenes play out in ways we have not scene before, particularly Hamlet's soliloquy where he holds a knife, Richard 3 as caricature, crowd interaction and participation, sweet talking bawdy ladies with Shakespeare's words. I loved this. Visually outstanding, with exquisite and intricate costumes.

I liked the lead actors charisma and presence. He was so in character and looked older for the part that I did not recognise him till the credits. Rhys Ifans starred in Notting Hill, and Pirate Radio.  He does a terrific job, perhaps his best work, as does the actor who plays Johnson.  There is a particular scene between the two of them at the end that makes me tear up even as I write.  Derek Jacobi, begins and ends the movie opening and closing the premise.

Vanessa Redgrave plays the doddering confused queen, and her daughter Joely Richardson plays her younger self, who has a torrid affair with the Earl of Oxford when she was young, producing an illicit heir. The queen has several torrid affairs which become part of the plot of succession. Shakespeare was played by Rafe Spall, son of Timothy Spall, who you have probably seen in several movies.

If the screenwriter was hoping to persuade me,  he certainly made me think. Perhaps he goes too overboard with Shakespeare having a unique form of illiteracy, he can read words and memorise them but he can't write, and yet he is a scheming manipulative lout, a criminal, a drunkard, a successful entrepreneur, and a sociopath.  Asked to speak to a crowd he stumbles inarticulately over his words. If Shakespeare was as inarticulate, and uneducated as portrayed, how could he have convinced anyone of his genius when he lacked the most basic skills of expression.

If not Shakespeare, then who?

I did some online research.  Apparently, almost two centuries passed before anyone seriously questioned Shakespeare's authorship.  It has been suggested that Sir Francis Bacon wrote these plays, but why would an already famous writer give credit to someone else.  DeVere appears to be the current favorite among conspiracy theorists.  If DeVere was excluded from the court, as he is in the movie then he would not be in a position to satirise the court, or include such pointed commentary in his plays.  DeVere as a child in the movie performs a piece from Midsummer nights dream for the queen. He could hardly have written it as an adult then, could he?Curiously, at times the movie appears to undermine its own premise.

It has been suggested that Sir Thomas North,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/North-of-Shakespeare-The-True-Story-of-the-Secret-Genius-Who-Wrote-the-World-s-Greatest-Body-of-Literature/dp/146370366X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">North of Shakespeare: The True Story of the Secret Genius Who Wrote the World's Greatest Body of Literature</a>, wrote the materials on which some of Shakespeare's plays were based.

He did translate Plutarch which Shakespeare used as a source in several plays such as Julius Caesar, Troilus and Cressida, Coriolanus, and Anthony and Cleopatra, adapting them for the stage, converting the words from prose to verse. According to this book, Shakespeare purchased North's works, and then adapted them from the page to the stage.  In some cases the corresponding passages in Shakespeare are word for word what was written by North. Somehow North did not get credit.  Rosalinde from As You Like It apparently is Elisa Nord, (north)North's daughter.

Hamlet was adapted from a centuries old story called Amleth, and had several iterations, including Dial of Princes by North. Shakespeare made numerous changes to the original story  Amleth, making it way darker according to a book I read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven-Basic-Plots-Why-We-Tell-Stories/dp/0826480373/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories</a>.

In the movie Ben Johnson proclaims sincere affection for DeVere's language skills.
In reality, Ben Johnson famously said of Shakespeare: ""he would... buy the reversion of old plays,""but then mark not whose 'twas first: and after-times may judge it to be his...""Epigram no. 56.

The movie claims no manuscript written by Shakespeare survives. If you don't have evidence that Shakespeare wrote something, does that mean you have evidence someone else wrote it?  You cannot infer alternative authorship from a negation, only from evidence. If you have evidence that these plays were previously written, and performed or were adapted from books, then you can verify that Shakespeare was not the originator, merely wrote a version, and credit the original source.  It seems that with some of these plays, they were circulating already, and then Shakespeare wrote a version, or made his own adaptation, which then became the definitive version.

Undoubtedly, this movie will stimulate debate and controversy.  The idea that he didn't write a single word goes too far in my opinion, it would be interesting to know for sure what he did and did not write.  I do think this is one of the best movies I have seen all year.

Wherever you stand on this,  I highly recommend you see it, consider it, and form your own opinion.  For me, it's too tabloidy to be taken seriously, the once virgin queen now a nympho, having an illegitimate son with the real Shakespeare, and so on.

Even if like me you do not agree with the premise, you might be surprised to discover you still love the movie.

I think you will enjoy it, and I hope this was helpful.",1319846400,19,7490,5.170671085335543
4977989,5,B0068MNNOE,"Well, as opposed to some other reviewers, we actually saw the movie, and found it wonderful. It's a spectacular movie! It traces the story of Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford, who actually wrote the Shakespeare plays but couldn't do it under his own name because earls weren't supposed to write plays for the masses in those days. It correctly points out that it was ridiculous to think that Will Shakespeare, a rural grain merchant, who had had a grade school education in a country town, could barely write, was allegedly almost illiterate, had never been to court and had no knowledge of court life, had never been abroad and presumably knew little of geography and knew no other language, could have written plays centering around court intrigues, foreign cities and customs (Romeo and Juliet,  Merchant of Venice, etc,), Roman History (Julius Caesar, etc), sprinkled with words of French, Latin and Italian. And no manuscript has ever been found in his handwriting. Give me a break!

The acting and costumes and settings were superb. The plot was engaging and intriguing. Don't miss it.",1319846400,3,1089,4.945355191256831
4977990,1,B0068MNNOE,"Is at the heart of this conspiracy theory movie which asserts that Elizabeth the 1st gave birth to no less 4 bastard princes, and was careless enough to have lost track of the one who was the Earl of Oxford, who they declare actually wrote the Shakespearian body of work, and she accidentally had an incestuous affair with him which resulted in the birth of the Earl of Southampton.
Oxford, according to the hackneyed , overblown and pompous screenplay written by John Orloff, wrote ""Midsummer Night's Dream "" when he was a mere lad of 9 years old!
Shakespeare himself is portrayed as an illiterate actor (neat trick, how did he learn his lines if he couldn't read them!)who is merely a front for Oxford, who writes all his plays as political satire and comentary. (Oh, lest I forget, Shakespeare also murdered Marlowe, by ""cutting his throat"". I'd always read that the coroner's inquest at the time states Marlowe was stabbed in the eye. One of many inaccuracies in the film.)
No scholars accept this heretical ideology , which was began in the mid 1800's by a woman who ended her days in an insane asylum, and which has class warfare and snobbery at it's base.
The film is over the top , Da Vinci Code style calumny, which attempts to discredit the two giants of the Elizabeth Age, The Sweet Swan of Avon and the Virgin Queen herself.
If I want high fantasy and insane political intrigue I'll watch ""Game of Thrones""!
Emmerich, true to form, can't resist blowing things up and setting them ablaze, and he does treat the audiance to a bevy of young handsome boys whose performances ring as hollow as the dialogue which is not penned by the bard. Redgrave and Richardson casting is a clever conciet, if you overlook the fact that Richardson is 47, and Elizabeth came to the throne at age 25. I could go on , but to what purpose?
Long story short, unless you have a large appetite for nonsense, step away from Anonymous.",1319328000,10,1919,4.5813953488372094

Because the statue of her holds a ""spear"" she was also called, ""The Shaker of the Spear of Knowledge at the Serpent of Ignorance."" This is the reason why Bacon, who was the leader of this group of literary giants, choose the man Shakepere as his ""front man,"" (he spelled his name without the last ""a"" in his name.) Bacon made him add the other ""a"" in case he was hauled up in front of a judge for writing these treasonable plays. Since Bacon was also the head of the Masonic Order, as well as the secret son of Queen Elizabeth the First, he wanted to educate the non-reading public of the tyranny of kings through the production of the plays......A clue to Bacon's part authorship of the plays lies in the King James Bible which Bacon edited. One has only to look up the 46th psalm of David and count the 46th word down which is ""Shake,"" and the 46th word up, which is, ""Spear,"" to see this clue.....There are countless others, such as, ""The North Cumberland Manuscript,"" listing many of the plays with Bacon's signature.....

4977992,5,B0068MNNOE,"Both Vanessa Redgrave and Joely Richardson deliver meticulous performances in one of the most intriguing films of the 21st century (thus far), that presents that Oxfordian, centuries old, position about who authored the 37 plays attributed to William Shakespeare. The facts I learned about the period, such as that there was so much mud around the Globe theater that boards were walked upon since there were no concrete sidewalks, give this film the feel of one that has been extraordinarily well researched to the finest details. I like that. A lot.

Movies that wreak of stupidity drive me nuts. Thus, this mastery of intrigue of a motion picture, done with extremely precise costuming for the period, sets to create that feeling on actually being in the period, and even the accents used, most especially by Vanessa Redgrave, who is so brilliant a character actor, doing period pieces and historical dramas, who can also make the most serious of moments fill up with such human emotion that audiences feel more than one emotion at a time. I mean, I know the scene is serious but somehow Vanessa Redgrave injects it with an aire of lightness of being that is nearly funny. At the very least, amusing. The heaviness of the topic of who authored the plays attributed to Shakespeare is de-centered by Redgrave's talent for taking me along her journey through becoming a character. Bette Davis is the only other actor who could do that for me.

In addition, the movie further muddies the story by focusing too much on the political machinations of Elizabeth I's reign and court. While watching it all I could think of was how I wished Mike Leigh had directed this and shown us the facts of de Vere's life and how they very well may have been portrayed in the plays themselves as well as focus on interesting facts like how the first folio is dedicated to the Earls William and Philip Herbert, ""the incomparable pair of brethen."" William was known not only to be a patron of Shakespeare's and to have had a Shakespeare sonnet dedicated to him but was also negotiated to have married de Vere's second eldest daughter but didn't and Philip was married to de Vere's youngest daughter Susan. There's also the de Vere family lore that ""Midsummer's Night Dream"" was first performed at the wedding of de Vere's eldest daughter. On the positive side, there's some fine acting in this (Redgrave, Ifans, and Bower) but there's some not so great -- the actors who play actor Shakespeare and playwright Ben Jonson are unconvincing.

4978032,5,B0068MNNOE,"How could a small town glove maker's son end up the most celebrated writer of all time? If it sounds impossible to you that  William Shakespeare could  actually be the fellow who came up with ""Hamlet,"" ""Macbeth,"" ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Midsummer's Night Dream,"" and more, then ""Anonymous"" is a movie you'll want to see.  It explores the theory that old Will was just a front man for a more cultured,  highly educated writer -- a genius who could ill afford to be recognized as a playwright, a profession looked down upon by the very nobility he belonged to. Indeed, many ""Oxfordians"" truly believe that the 17th Earl of Oxford, Edward de Vere, probably penned all the plays and sonnets we attribute to the Bard. Did he and Mr. Shakespeare pull off the greatest hoax in all of literature? While still a work of fiction, the movie puts forth a plausible  theory of how this possibly could happen. Regardless if you think it probable or not, the movie's cloak and dagger intrigue makes it worth your while. I particularly liked the effect of the first scene, imaginatively taking us from a Broadway theater to Elizabethan London.

Years ago, I spent some time doing my own personal research (Google primarily) looking into the various current societies & organizations dedicated to either the upholding of Shakespeare as author of his titled works as well as the rebuttal arguements which conclude he could not have authored such works.  As such, I find the topic fascinating ;)  I definitely enjoyed this film and would recommend to anybody with even a mild familiarity w/Shakespeare.  If, for NOTHING else, it encourages open-minded allowance of alternate perspectives on the author, whomever he/she may be.  For whomever authored the works, they have been, by any definition, some of THE most important and intelligent works of literary art to date.
  Personally, having hit the ripe old age of 50, the story presents yet ANOTHER, (quite believable) example of how much of our psyche & psychological being has been formed from ingrained belief systems that we are CONDITIONED to believe .... belief systems which the brave & willing of us come to question as we age towards a hopefully inspired evolution towards truth ;)",1471737600,,1351,5.222222222222222

However, all are riddled with as many problems and lacunae as our current knowledge of the man from Stratford-upon-Avon.  I doubt we will ever know whether any one or combination of the theories is correct, and in effect, it doesn't really matter. The author Shakespeare - whoever he or they were - wrote plays and poems that encompass an ever-enduring and comprehensively human world, populated by the most deeply colorful kaleidoscope of great personalities and memorable characters yet imagined, all speaking in poetry unlikely ever to be transcended.  Searching for proof of Shakespeare's identity and its small details is a diversion that, in the end, can yield no real aides for understanding and appreciating the rich complexities of his vision.",1447804800,,946,5.293333333333333

The Earl of Oxfords calligraphed plays (or maybe it's just the title page?) bound neatly in their leather portfolios captures my brain I wonder what poundage the crunchy parchment is. I recall reading how the parchment is processed and coated with some substance to accept the gall ink but cant recall exactly what that is. I think the parchment is close to, if not even over, 200#. I know the 20# bond copy paper I buy from Wal-mart is not anywhere near the thickness of parchment but yet I buy such as it is cheap ($3.96 a ream) and I know my writings will not survive 400+ years. So I save a bundle of $$$ by not fantasizing.

So why cant I stay awake? I think the answer may lie in why cant I stay awake through Scorseses *Taxi Driver*. I see Scorsese in an unattributed role sitting in Bobbys taxi, cursing his on-screen wife is with another man, and then the credits are rolling. I think there should be more to the movie after Scorseses scene, but after multiple viewings, Ive yet to see the movie as I would imagine.

I mean, I love Scorseses flicks. Whos That Knocking at My Door. The King of Comedy. The Last Temptation of Christ. Goodfellas. But with Taxi Driver, all I can remember about it is how Jodie Foster rocked in Freaky Friday and how her on-screen mother when switched with Jodie called her husband daddy. That still tickles me!! Even as I write this review I wonder if Jodie would have been as brilliant in Paper Moon as Tatum ONeal. Maybe not. But then Tatum wouldnt have been as brilliant as Jodie in Freaky Friday. I mean, can you see Tatum field hockeying the wrong way down the field? Hardly. The girl can do no wrong. Even when she married John McEnroe. Wasnt that the greatest he forced Jimmy Connors to up his game? Poor Bjorn Borg not a clue. Oh, well. Now tennis is strictly a game of slam dunkages. B-o-r-i-n-g.

But wonderful actors and exquisitely detailed scenes could not compensate for a wholly unbelievable plot. I was prepared for the plot to be a bit contrarian -- it suggests that the Earl of Oxford, not Shakespeare, wrote Shakespeare's plays.

However, many of the characters are shown behaving in ways that contradict the historical records of that era -- and we have pretty good records of Elizabethan England.

4978084,5,B0068MNNOE,"ANONYMOUS is one of the best & most accurate film portrayals of actual people & events - though license is taken, as in all dramatic renderings - you are likely to ever run across.  Set in Elizabethan England, the central issue in the film is a presentation of the ""Oxfordian Argument""  that the works attributed to William Shaksper, of Stratford-upon-Avon, an apparently illiterate Elizabethan era street hustler, were actually written by The 17th Earl of Oxford, Edward DeVere, a favorite at Queen Elizabeth's Court, who spoke six languages fluently, was among the best educated people in the world, had the leisure time & office staff to write 37 plays, four long narrative poems & 154 sonnets whose life paralleled plot points, characters & locations in the works of ""Shake-Speare"" & who was recorded in his times as being one of the most accomplished poets & playwrights at Court.

This is known among we who care as the ""Oxfordian vs Stratfordian Authorship Argument"", which is a pip of an intellectual delight - especially since we OXFORDIANS - believe it or not - ARE IN THE MINORITY!  In other words, among people who teach Shakespeare, about 90% are convinced a man who apparently could not write his own name penned the greatest literature in the history of the world!

That fact, puts us in the delicious position of not only being right on the issue, but also allows us to be righteous about being right!  We're under-dog outsiders up against a vested-interest institution that is likely to be brought to the truth only slowly... one funeral at a time.  Gotta bring a grin to even the most grizzled visage!  Another among many examples people will believe the most preposterous malarkey regardless of reason or common sense: The Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, Santa Clause, The Great Pumpkin & William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon!  All of a heap!  The more absurd the notion the harder held.

ANONYMOUS presents the Oxfordian alternative to the risible Stratfordian yarn in an intelligent & extremely careful & clever manner by blending the details of actual events into imagined fictional scenes.  The film does this in a way that details from one or another famous episode in DeVere's fabulously dissipated life are put together.  For example, director Roland Emmerich, stages the scene where DeVere comes to realize the political power of the emerging popular theater of the Elizabethan era on a tennis court - the scene of a real physical assault by DeVere on Sir Phillip Sidney that became a major scandal & the first of a series of public brawls involving Oxford & his cadre of thugs right out of ROMEO & JULIET .

The holder of the oldest noble title in England & by definition a ""Gentleman"" was not a ""gentle man"".  The scene in ANONYMOUS shading toward this aspect of Oxford's character is the opening of the ""You're Writing Again!"" scene - DeVere's niggardly hundred pound dowry offer smacks of the real-life mind-set DeVere had toward Anne & their three daughters.  He was profligate in his personal expenditures in the extreme & penurious & downright mean with his family.  Edward DeVere may have been a real fun guy & the scion of the oldest peerage in England, but he was certainly no ""prince"" when it came to dealing with his wife & children.  William Cecil, Lord Burghley, took custody of all three girls when Anne Cecil DeVere died in 1588 & married them off quite nicely.  Both Anne's & Oxford's death sixteen years later are suspected suicides, by the way.

The most important of the film's melded life/fiction scenes is the film's depiction of  DeVere killing a servant - staged in the film as a precursor to the killing of Polonius in HAMLET as well as dramaturgically setting up the ill-fated, real-life Oxford/Cecil marriage.

.
Though the timeline of the actual murder - which took place in a kitchen, the victim being an undercook whom DeVere fatally wounded in the leg - is such that it preceded the DeVere/Cecil marriage by four years raises doubts about whether Burghley used it to force DeVere to marry Anne. Four years is, indeed, a long time to stretch out a threat against a seventeen year old boy.  But we're talking about ""The right honorable Syr William Cecil, Knighte, Baron of Burghley, Knighte of The Honorable Order of The Garter, Master of Her Majesty's Court of Wards & Lieuries, one of the Lordes of Her Majesty's Privy Council and the Lord High Treasurer of England"" - then in his early middle-age - who would certainly have had enough eminence over a seventeen year old - to whom he was a surrogate father since the boy was twelve - to force such a nuptial promise.  And that the ""I can have your head chopped off"" reality of Cecil's power might intimidate the young DeVere for forty-eight months - who continued under his father-law-to-be's wardship right up to the wedding - isn't as far fetched as it first may seem.

I like the whole Southampton as DeVere & Elizabeth's son idea.  Fatherly love - a double theme in the film when you realize the relationship between Burghley & his son Robert is one of the major stories being so masterfully told - explains Shakespeare's gushy dedications to Southampton better to my mind than the assumption the two were homosexual lovers.  DeVere's bisexuality was a known fact.  However, not all love is ""Eros"", as the Greek would tells us... ""without superfluous moiety.""  The film's paternal treatment of the relationship hits me as more emotionally likely.  As a father I know you cannot have a greater love in this world than your love for your children.  It's transcendent of self to the level of ""Agape"" in the ancient Aegean tongue.  ""Philos"" doesn't cover it.  Not even close. You'd sacrifice your life in half a heart-beat for your child.  Everything is nothing to that.  It's the same sort of thing DeVere expresses to Southampton in the sonnets & dedications.  I buy it.

The incest notion between Oxford & Elizabeth, on the other hand, is way beyond the pale.  DeVere was born in 1550 during the reign of Edward The Sixth - not ""Bloody Mary"" as said in the picture.  The matter is disposed of by Royal records of the King's christening gift to John DeVere, Edward's father & the 16th Earl of Oxford, of a silver chalice on that event.  No matter how taken you may be with actor Edward Hogg's tearful delivery of this Oedipal news to Rhys Ifan's wonderful performance, the idea falls into the category of baloney, whereas the affair between Elizabeth & the married Oxford is a fact & could have resulted in Southampton's being their son.  At least ""kinda maybe"".  After all, it's ONLY A MOVIE!  Not a Brittanica article, or a thesis for a doctorate in history from Stanford. To me ""fatherly affection"" seems the right interpretive choice.  Besides, issue from Elizabeth isn't the only way DeVere could have been Southampton's father.  The sexually adventurous sort of fellow Lord DeVere was may have thought cuckolding a fellow Lord would be great sport!

ANONYMOUS is delightfully replete with smidgens of  unhighlighted details such as bits of referential dialogue. For example, the writer, John Orloff,  uses the word ""reptilia"" - a favorite epithet of DeVere's brother-in-law Lord Peregrine Bertie - to describe persons at court.  Or the horrific fact of Oxford's marriage to Anne Cecil - a mess deluxe - by casting a minor child as ""Bridget"" DeVere who seems to be of mixed race, hinting at the actual real-life charges of infidelity Oxford had publicly leveled against his long-suffering wife as well as brushing the edges of OTHELLO. The film abounds in such wily touches that should delight any astute & well studied Oxfordian & makes this DVD is a real ""must have""!

Ps.  If you're intrigued by the ""Authorship Question"", I'd suggest reading ""SHAKESPEARE BY ANOTHER NAME"" by Mark Anderson.  Or J. Thomas Looney's  (pronounced LOH nee)  ""SHAKESPEARE IDENTIFIED... "" It's the book that started The Oxford/Stratford debate in 1920.  Both are available as Kindle downloads.  While you're at it, get Amazon's THE COMPLETE WORKS OF SHAKESPEARE & read it.  Exposure to DeVere's magical use of the language will improve anyone's English!",1443830400,5,8149,4.856005788712012

4978116,3,B0068MNNOE,"Even though I am a committed Stratfordian I enjoyed this movie well enough. In fact I am surprised by how good it is. The visuals of 16th century London were fantastic- they are not completely accurate mind you, but its complete accuracy doesn't matter much, since it worked very well for the plot. The streets are at once alive and yet still deserted and labyrinthine enough for some Tudor-era cloak and dagger, and you get a world of contrast: the world of the average Londoner is grimy, uncouth, violent, and short. The world of the rulers meanwhile is splendor, although there is a sense of stifling, suffocating disconnect.
The acting is mixed, though some of this I believe is due to the script more than the cast (which I will touch on later). Rhys Ifans as Oxford is fantastic. He manages to pull off the reclusive, arrogant and yet very empathetic literary genius role really very well considering that's hardly a character appropriate to traditional thrillers. Likewise, Sebastian Armasto is also very good as Ben Jonson, and so is Sam Reid as Essex.
Now, the problems: David Thewlis, whom I normally love as an actor was good as a younger William Cecil. As soon as the character's hair turned gray however is when his portrayal sagged. At times I felt Thewlis was overemphasizing the [hysical frailty of the character-and his semi-raspy voice was just too much. Edward Hogg was good as Robert Cecil, but there's a point in the film where he doesn't so much as evolve as he just latches onto the part of Machiavellian archetype in a way I found unconvincing. This might be a problem with the script more so than the acting; on that note: Vanessa Redgrave. I know for a fact she's a brilliant actress. She always has been. This movie did not utilize her very well at all. The dialogue of an aged Queen Elizabeth borders on the infantile, while Joely Richardson's dialogue for the young Elizabeth has all the depth of vampire melodrama, which going back to Robert Cecil his speech near the end where he reveals his ""master plan"" though revealing an interesting twist is also quite cliched.
I also get the impression that no one was quite sure what to do with Will Shakespeare who is at once a bumbling semi-literate moron veering towards comedic relief and then just as suddenly he becomes an extortionist who's also probably a murderer.
Contrary to the other reviews here I didn't mind the jumping narrative so much as I didn't think that it worked in addition to the frame story where Derek Jacobi is the whole film's ostensible narrator. I think it would have been better overall had it either chopped off Jacobi's exposition of the basic plot-the doubts over William Shakespeare's authorship-which is well covered within the film anyway, or it alternatively could have left those bookends and then just worked as a standard biopic chronologically.
I think my biggest complaint of the film is that while Roland Emmerich is very capable of putting out sets, and story, and characters very well he creates some implications that are kind of disturbing if carried through. For instance, Oxford ruins his chances of being king through incest (which makes for some intriguing character development which Rhys Ifans pulls off again rather brilliantly), and it's hinted throughout the film that since Oxford is an honorable man that he would have been a good king. The movie doesn't really dwell at all in the implications of that. The Tudor era of England, and its successor the Jacobean era of Great Britain were eras of absolutism that were taken to their extreme in the largely inept Charles I who was then deposed, and executed. This laid the foundation for modern representative democracy as we know it. Skipping that Jacobean era entirely by placing benevolent monarchs on the throne might spell good governance, but it also spells good absolutist governance where ""democracies"" or ""republics,"" would be an academic issue only and feudalism would be the name of the game.
Thankfully, to enjoy the movie one needn't worry too much, and admittedly in style and plot it's not a bad film. It's certainly better than Emmerich's normal output, and it moves along at a pace that doesn't drag as much as it would be expected to considering the subject matter.",1426550400,,4262,4.83972602739726

4978119,5,B0068MNNOE,This is an excellent film which focuses on whether William Shakespeare actually wrote the plays and sonnets attributed to him. The theory is that a nobleman was the true author and used Shakespeare as a front. And there are plot twists that are appalling.  Great film. There's also a documentary on the subject but I don't recall the name. But it did make a believer out of me that it's unlikely Shakespeare was the true author.,1424822400,3,428,4.631578947368421

4978121,5,B0068MNNOE,For all of the people who took this for a documentary- RELAX!  It's a movie.  A work of fiction.  An interesting take on the lives of both Edward DeVere and Elizabeth I.  Almost as soon as Shakespeare died many historians and academics questioned whether or not he actually wrote everything accredited to him if anything at all.  It's a great film.  Scandalous!  Fantastic cast!,1424044800,2,378,4.8125
4978122,5,B0068MNNOE,"Excellent dramatisation of the Oxfordian thesis. Also recommended is the documentary ""Last Will and Testament"" which Emmerich executive-produced.",1423612800,,145,7.111111111111111
4978123,5,B0068MNNOE,"When it comes to the notorious Tudor monarchs, facts are stranger than fiction. What can be stranger than Henry VIII beheaded two of his six wives? It would be the myth of Elizabeth-I virginity, and the mystery of Shakespeare's true identity. If you buy into the Stratford's William Shaksper, son of John Shaksper, look again. Be diligent, scientific, and open minded.

All artists, musicians, painters, writers, and especially poets draw their inspirations from their personal lives and life experiences. There is nothing of the recorded life of the said grain merchant that is of interest to me, emotionally. psychologically, and especially philosophically. With English as my third language, for years I brush aside Shakespeare's works because I honestly cannot take seriously the mind of a grain merchant, no matter how pretentious, funny, deep, undecidable, and intellectual the verses are. There is nothing about making money, greed, status-quo, and business-as-usual is of great inspiration to me.

However, considering Edward de Vere's life experience, i.e. education, early writing talent, living in Italy, and peculiar complex life circumstances, Shakespeare's writings, especially the sonnets and Hamlet,  make total sense, and true, and human. For beginner, check out the book ""The Monument"" by Hank Whittemore, brilliant and yet common sense - Suddenly, the Sonnets become a masterpiece of double entendre by making the specifics vague with allusions. Just that much more remarkable, so compelling, so much pain, anguish, dilemma, etc. Freud updated his take on Hamlet after reading Looney's ""Shakespeare Identified"" (1920).

It's totally mediocre to see the Sonnets as fiction, however interesting the love triangle seems, or inherently paradoxical, i.e. gay men don't start their love letter by encouraging each other to marry for heirs. Why the poet encouraged the fair youth to get marry - See ""The Monument"" by Hank Whittemore, which subscribes to Prince Tudor I conjecture, where Anonymous used the Prince Tudor II conjecture in Beauclerk's book ""Shakespeare's Lost Kingdom"".

Plus there is just a lot of gratuitous sword-fighting, gun violence, rowdy roaring crowds, galloping horses, background noise and quick camera cuts.

4978137,4,B0068MNNOE,"Minus one star due to the poorly~lighted cinematography. When picturing the Renaissance or Elizabethan England, we usually think deep, rich earth tones reminiscent of that period's tapestries. Anonymous has smidgeons of this, but the coloration of the entire film is too dull and dark. The story is nonlinear, making it it unclear if you're unfamiliar with Cecil/Tudor history.

However, the acting is fantastic! I checked the film against the original script; Edward DeVere's character is listed as ""intensely handsome"", and wow does Rhys Ifans deliver. He's penetrating, charismatic, sharp, and sexy... the perfect lead. Thespian Vanessa Redgrave is compelling, fascinating and so fun to watch. I can't remember one poor performance from any actor, and kudos to Emmerich for this. However, comparing it to ""Shakespeare in Love"" and similar period films, it's not as delightful.  I also wish they released it as a rental... instead I had to buy it, and it's no Star Wars/Matrix/Amadeus change~the~face~of~cinema film .

Ifans is memorable as the Earl of Oxford, but the one who got and held my undivided attention was David Thewlis, as Sir William Cecil. Sir William is a truly sinister character. In pursuit of his own hidden agenda, he ""advises"" (manipulates)  with ease and skill. This is not an issue or an era I have spent much time thinking about, but this film has definitely kindled my interest in both.

4978142,1,B0068MNNOE,"My complaint with this film isn't the authorship question (although, as a literature major, I have issues with that beyond the scope of this review) - my complaint is the treatment of Elizabeth I, and in particular, her relationship with William Cecil. I adore Vanessa Redgrave, but someone gave her instruction (writer? director?) to play old Elizabeth as an almost-simpleton. Although it is inarguably true that Cecil (David Thewlis) had a vast impact on the politics of Elizabethan England through his various positions, I am unsure why it was necessary to portray Elizabeth as simpering and erratic in order to magnify Cecil's influence. Added to this is a long line of bastards that I won't get into, as spoilers abound in recounting the seemingly endless line of illegitimate offspring and their roles within the story.

In summation, one need never even consider the legitimacy of the authorship question due to the fact that so much else in this movie is so overly sensational. All that being said, most of the actors provide admirable performances with what they are given.

4978148,4,B0068MNNOE,"What a phenomenal work of art. The grand-sweeping scenes worked well with the close up and personal ones. The dialog was near Shakespearean but more modern and accessible. The acting complimented the overall Elizabethan feel and mood of the film. I'm not assuming expertise in great film making but I thoroughly enjoyed the art of this film.

I also liked the premise of the film. Most would say that the idea the 17th Earl of Oxford (Edward de Vere) actually wrote Shakespeare's plays and sonnets began with Looney's book, but actually Mark Twain, Helen Keller, and John Adams all came before Looney and pretty much believed the same thing. There are a lot in de Vere's favor that make one come to that conclusion. And I found this movie brushed against some of them tastefully.

But I also have my gripes. Not many, but still. I saw this movie when it first came out, and found myself confused with all the many subplots and earls and who was who and why it mattered. It wasn't explained as I think it should have been. I still cared about the characters in the film, but I didn't see (at first viewing) what was so important to them - save for the main problem: of de Vere giving his work up to someone else because it simply wasn't fitting an earl writing for the theater.

Overall, I enjoyed this film and just had to see it again, it only because it's the first and only movie to dare put this very old ""myth"" out there.",1412380800,6,1426,4.435114503816794

Honestly i doubt it was the small countrysider that worked in the playhouse looking after the horses and was described as a grain hoarder, tax dodger, money lender and ruthless businessman of Stratford-upon-Avon ... Shakespeare designed the English language - this was an intellectual - a researcher of all languages, a traveler, a philosopher, a poet and an artist - William Shakespeare the 'man' just wasn't any of those things - he never even taught his children to read!!? To be honest i doubt even one single man wrote Shakespeare - i am more a follower of the clandestine Sir Francis Bacon 'thinktank' - a roundtable of all the best minds at the time who wrote all the plays between themselves - thereby filling them with all their combined knowledge - as a deliberate way to 'create' a 'one land one language' concept - to raise patriotism for the country under both Queen Elizabeth I and King James (VI and I), through a single ""British language"" which everyone could finally communicate with, both at court and in public. As previous to Shakespeare's plays there was no Modern English language - they spoke mutually intelligible languages, similar to modern Frisian - the language of the northeastern region of the Netherlands - that is called Old English. Four major dialects of Old English emerged, along with the Anglo-Norman French dialect that had considerable Germanic influences in addition to the basic Latin roots. Also due to the King James Bible - the English language became the prominently spoken and read language of the day (16th C) and from then onwards. Many familiar words and phrases were coined or first recorded by Shakespeare, some 2,000 words and countless idioms are his. Newcomers to Shakespeare are often shocked at the number of cliches contained in his plays, until they realize that he coined them and they became cliches afterwards. ""One fell swoop,"" ""vanish into thin air,"" and ""flesh and blood"" are all Shakespeare's. Words he bequeathed to the language include ""critical,"" ""leapfrog,"" ""majestic,"" ""dwindle,"" and ""pedant"" a word that suits Shakespeare the poet well, but Shakespeare the man - i doubt it!... So i enjoy this film - it is well made and the period sets and costumes are incredibly well done. However the question still remains unsolved for me - Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford was a most learned man of the day - but alone write Shakespeare - i think it was a clandestine operation to 'create a language' to forge the British Isles into the United Kingdom it would have to become to save itself from the ongoing invasions of fundamentalist Roman Catholic counties like Spain.",1411516800,,2709,4.891304347826087

4978171,5,B0068MNNOE,"The historians hate it, but hey they can't take away how well written and executed this film is. Is it historically inaccurate yes, is it based on a conspiracy theory yes, is it the worst thing I've eve seen, far from it. The story itself as well all know by now is based of the theory that the man we know as Will Shakespeare is not responsible for penning the plays and poems accredited to him. This film is goes into tell a tail that yes, cannot be proven and does at times manipulate history to get its point across, but if you know anything about Shakespeare you would know that only 5% of what we know about his life is true and the other 95% is also (like this movie) fiction. (However this movie is more historically accurate than the speculative life of Shakespeare.)  Also someone said in a lower rated review that this movie portrays the ""Virgin Queen"" like an ""emotional whore"" well I saw her being portrayed as human. The truth these people lived over 4 hundred years ago, what he know about them is all second hand, but what we do know is that people today are no different then from the Elizabethan era and we all have our secrets.

I would highly recommend this movie to those who want to take a different look at the story of Shakespeare. I would highly recommend watching ""Last Will and Testament"" as well so that you understand the De Vere theory better.

4978176,4,B0068MNNOE,"Roland Emmerich has specialized in destroying the world on screen: by alien invasion (Independence Day); monsters (Godzilla); climate change (The Day After Tomorrow); and fulfillment of an ancient prophecy (2012). In the films, humanity (or some of it) manages to survive. 2012 is all special effects, with no real characters or story. But the first two films are wildly entertaining if you don't take them too seriously. Emmerich knows his genres, and the films are full of sly allusions to 1950's alien invasion and giant monster spectacles, with dialog that owes something to Hollywood screwball comedies. The Day After Tomorrow is more serious, with a plausible climate change premise that Emmerich expands to the limit.

In Anonymous, Emmerich adopts the same strategy. All the characters and incidents start with a premise that seems plausible (if you don't look too closely at it) and is then developed to the grotesque limit. Historians and Shakespeare scholars may be outraged, but they miss the point. The main purpose of films (like Shakespeare's plays) is to be entertaining. And the main pleasure of this film (to someone who is familiar with the plays and some of the Shakespeare scholarship) is to see how the film develops its premises: that Edward DeVere was a brilliant writer who could only express himself in plays and poetry; that Shakespeare was a semi-literate schemer; and Elizabeth a promiscuous and insecure woman completely dependent on the diabolical Cecils. None of these premises will bear close examination, but neither will some of the premises of most other films about Shakespeare (Shakespeare In Love) or Queen Elizabeth (Elizabeth and its sequel Elizabeth: The Golden Age). But these are films, not scholarly treatises, and if they get enough historical detail right so that you can suspend your disbelief, they can be very entertaining, even if you know the history.

Even if you believe (like almost all Elizabethan scholars) that Shakespeare's plays were written by Shakespeare, Anonymous is a very entertaining film provided that you don't take it too seriously, and enjoy seeing how an alternate view of history can be developed from a few apparently plausible premises.",1393718400,3,2211,5.225352112676056

4978193,3,B0068MNNOE,"The acting is superb, and the story compelling - but that's all it is because the film pointedly ignores facts we already know about William Shakespeare.

In the film Shakespeare is an uneducated, illiterate drunkard who cannot tell the difference between one letter and another.  The reality is William Shakespeare came from a well-off family and was educated until the age 13.  Now that seems young, but in Elizabethan times, you went to University at the age of 14.  And his was a classical education with reading, writing, arithmetic, French, Latin and religious studies.  The reason he never went to university was his father's business faltered (he owned a glover manufacturing plant) and needed William to help in the business.  Shakespeare also wrote several sonnets for the King James Bible.

Later, after Shakespeare stopped writing his plays, he was the headmaster at another school - something you cannot get a job doing without having an appropriate education.  While there is no written record of him traveling abroad, records from that era are sparse at best, so he may well have sailed to Italy or France.  But even if he hadn't, stories about various royal courts and noblemen were plentiful and he could have learned of various events and protocols from reading and listening to the stories and gossip of the day.

So while I suggest renting this film purely for the enjoyment of the acting and cinematography, anyone thinking this might be a true representation of the facts will be mistaken.",1390435200,2,1511,4.98406374501992

I began to research the latest theories concerning this issue and stumbled upon this film and showed a preview to the students.  The movie trailer looked very interesting and I ended up buying the movie off of Amazon.  I couldn't find it anywhere else.  The movie gives a very dramatic theory as to who really wrote the works of Shakespeare and it was very entertaining.  It is a film that takes some very dramatic liberties with the whole issue and the only downfall is that people watching the movie might think that because it is a movie...that it must be the gospel truth.  It is not.  The movie really stretches some of the known facts to make their ""story"" work.  It is great fun however and it does bring out some new questions.  The film is very well made and the acting is excellent.  It is a shame that this movie didn't do well in the box office and that it isn't more well known.  I would be a little nervous about showing this to high school students...it is PG-13...but I wouldn't show it.  I did, however, come back and discuss some of the movie and focused on the long debate that the Earl of Oxford was the one that wrote the plays.  We began look at other theories too.  The DVD version does have a ""behind the scenes"" feature that has the director and screenwriter discussing their process in making the movie and this would be something that would great for students to look at.  Even if you don't use the film for school...it is still very enjoyable for anyone who loves the bard and the great authorship mystery.

The end result is a production that must frustrate the serious historian and confuse the casual observer.

Elizabeth I has a pivotal role in this film, although it is not really about her. But it is always fun to watch her strut her stuff on the screen.

Elizabeth I, who was obviously a real monarch, is such a powerful personage that she makes a great film character. And she does in this movie, which is half the reason for watching it.

Vanessa Redgrave's Elizabeth is a lavish, but aged, confused, and weak Queen who is frightened and vulnerable - very different from what we are used to in 'Bess Movies'. She's also the female equivalent of a 'stud', having given birth to many illegitimate children, in secret, of course - yeah, sure.

The historical Bess was as much an actress as a monarch. The design of her clothes was chosen carefully to make her look larger than life. He father, Henry VIII started the trend, but then he WAS larger than life, at over 6 feet tall, and by the end of his life, so heavy (let's avoid the unkind word 'fat') that he had to be carried on a litter.

Like Henry, Bess held a lavish court to impress diplomats and visiting dignitaries. England was an emerging power and needed to look the part. Court drama and intrigue were in high gear, or so we are told in our time.

Which brings to mind the words: ""All the world's a stage..."" Truth and fiction become mixed and indistinguishable. And this film is a perfect example of it, but it's fun to watch, none the less.

And of course, Elizabeth reigned when Will Shakespeare was writing all those boffo plays and sonnets. Or did he?

That's the absurd yet tantalizing crux of this movie, that Shakespeare was a manipulative blackmailing fraud and the Earl of Oxford, Edward de Vere, was the true author of all Shakespeare's works. Only he had to stay anonymous for political and social reasons, and the religious fanatics, the Cecil's, didn't like him, or he didn't like them, and he was in a loveless marriage of inconvenience, or blackmail, or something - it's all very confusing. Again, why the film is fun, it keeps you as off balance as the entire concept is unbalanced!

So watch it with tongue-in-cheek and wink-of-eye. Then it works and works well.

It's an intriguing concept, but a bit of a mash up as a film. I dismissed the plausibility of the premise as soon as I saw that Edward de Vere was wearing more eye makeup than Elizabeth I (the Queen of Makeup) herself! Although it really made his face stand out and brought out his features, anyone who can out do Elizabeth in the make up department - and not be confined to the Tower - is obviously not for real!

Which leaves the film to be enjoyed for what I feel it really is, a highly fanciful historical costume drama.

I liked the film, for its costumes (Elizabeth was really well decked out!), the court intrigue (those evil puritanical, fanatical, pro-Scottish Cecils), and the commoner's intrigue -- Shakespeare, Marlow and Jonson all plotting against and threatening each other in between visits to the ale house and brothel -- with an occasional play thrown in to keep us on track.

I recommend the film for the fun of seeing Elizabethan England yet again, with the contrasts between the squalor and the opulence (the squalor being the common folk, the opulence, the court).

Watch it for the great actors - all of them -  and their convincing portrayals of historical characters who are so distorted that they are fictional (if they were accurate, they'd have been unbelievably dull). History is written by the victors, or something like that!

Enjoy it for the fantasy that Elizabeth I, far from being the ""Virgin Queen"", was the mother of many who became nobles.

Yes, in this adventure, Bess has children, SEVERAL children yet does not know who they are (not even their names), but the Cecil's do? Uh huh, one of the greatest political leaders and strategists of England is clueless about her secret offspring... okay...

And, she -- one of the most publicly recognized and closely guarded monarchs in history (she was under threat of death by Pope Pius V who had excommunicated her, among other problems) -- does this in secret-- in a world where secrets were really hard to keep? Look at Henry's reign, everyone was telling on everyone else! Wonderfully absurd!

That should be a giveaway that the movie is a mash up. If they threw in a few zombies (I think I saw some in the Globe Theater audience) it could not have been more absurd!

But it is not the absurdity of the premise of the film that should be an issue. This can be dismissed as an elaborate joke on us.

If done so, I think you can enjoy the film for the interplay of the characters, the brilliant acting, the very well composed dialog (okay, Shakespeare wrote half of it anyway), the cinematography the costumes, the sets. All this is very well done and there is enough eye candy to satisfy any historical fan. As cinema, this is a very fine and well crafted movie.

I admit, there aren't any high speed car chases (how'd they miss out on those?) but there are some pseudo explosions (mostly staged explosions and cannon fire) for fans of such stuff.

They also used an intriguing approach to the whole thing by wrapping it in a kind of flashback.

The film opens in modern day New York supposedly as a stage play itself, narrated by noted Shakespearean actor, Derek Jacobi. As Jacobi (always a treat) narrates, the film morphs from stage to full screen and we are transported to Elizabethan London. At the end of the film (after everyone dies), we are transported back with equal grace and hear some very serious conjecturing about the truth and validity of the whole thing, and the glory of the plays and sonnets (which at least IS true). As silly as that is, it moved me because I really liked the characters and was still getting over their dying off. That's the problem with historical fiction, everyone dies in the end. Nevertheless, I liked this approach in the film, I thought it was clever.

The film also does two things that most historical dramas ignore:

1. It actually rains - a LOT - in England. What a concept!

2. The interiors are all dark, in spite of many, many candles burning as brightly as they can. (The lighting in this film must have been very tricky to engineer)

We know from history and climate that this, at least, is accurate. It was a wet, dank, dark, dirty age.

So we have some 'authentic' stuff mixed in with the most fantastical plot, confusing the whole thing for us.

Yet it is an enjoyable film and a 'who-done-it-to-whom.'

I say, enjoy the confusion -- especially the flashbacks that make it impossible until the end to know what's really going on. Robert Cecil, like any good villain, can't help but brag at the end when he's truly defeated Edward de Vere (whom he hates with a passion) just how he did it! Thank goodness, I'd never have figured it out otherwise!

Bottom Line:

This is a very well crafted and fun film when taken for what it is, an elaborate fantasy suggesting alternative history. It's a fun ride to explore 'what if Shakespeare didn't write his plays'. It's fun to go back in time and once more see how bad living conditions were -- maybe we wouldn't complain so much if we appreciated how far we have come.

And there's Elizabeth I.

Any film with her in it is a must see for me.",1376092800,,7355,4.5588458618071375

4978276,5,B0068MNNOE,"Actor George Dillon has said, ""The purpose of drama is to challenge people and to make people see things slightly differently."" The challenge is laid down in stunning fashion by German director Roland Emmerich in his latest work, Anonymous, one of the best films of the year. Focusing on two of the most important events of the Elizabethan age: the Essex Rebellion of 1601 and the succession to the throne of Queen Elizabeth I, the film supports the premise that Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, a prominent aristocrat and court insider, was the real author of the works attributed to William Shakespeare, plays and poems of romance, tragic political intrigue, and comedy that contain such a compelling beauty and searing intensity that, after 400 years, still reach directly into our hearts and remain there forever.

Described as a ""political thriller"", Anonymous creates an atmosphere of foreboding and intrigue that, like many films of the genre, begins with a jumble of names, images, and flashbacks that challenge us to sort it all out. We are not certain of anything, but Emmerich invites us, in the words of Diane Ackerman ""to groom our curiosity like a high-spirited thoroughbred, climb aboard, and gallop over the thick, sunstruck hills."" Steering us through the maze of Tudor history, the film makes credible the startling events of the time, providing an authentic recreation of London in the 16th century with its crowded theaters and raucous audience, cluttered streets, and court royalty decked out in fine jewels.

Though some may point out historical inaccuracies in the film, Emmerich, citing Shakespeare in Love as an example, says that the film contains an ""emotional truth"" rather than a literal one because ""the drama is the primary concern."" He need not have had concern on that aspect. Through Emmerich's direction, the writing of John Orloff, the cinematography of Anna Foerster, and the superlative performance of an all British cast including Oscar-worthy performances by Vanessa Redgrave as Queen Elizabeth I and Rhys Ifans as Oxford, Anonymous succeeds both as an authentic drama and a plausible explanation for many of the problems surrounding the authorship question. While the film may lack a certain depth of characterization, it more than makes up for it with style, spectacle, and an involving story.

To some, the film may be skating on narrative thin ice, Emmerich, however, told an interviewer that ""if we provoke, let's provoke all the way,"" and provoke he does. According to Anonymous, de Vere, in addition to being Shakespeare, was also the illegitimate son of the Queen and, in 1573, the father of a son with Elizabeth, Henry Wriothesley, the 3rd Earl of Southampton (Xavier Samuel). Emmerich handles the subject of incest with great taste, with neither the ""Virgin Queen"" nor Oxford knowing the truth until close to the end of their lives. After a brief prologue by actor Sir Derek Jacobi, the film begins with the arrest of playwright Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armento) by faceless men in knight's armor in the middle of a theatrical performance.

The author of the play is a well-known writer who, though he is soon released, is taken to the Tower and accused of sedition and slandering the State by the mere act of authoring a play, the mark of a totalitarian society reflecting a growing disdain for the arts. The film then flashes back five years, then forty years, as we become acquainted with the young Earl of Oxford (Jamie Campbell Bower), taught by highly educated tutors with access to a vast library in the home of William Cecil (David Thewlis), where he was brought up as a ward of the court after his father's death. We also witness his marriage to a teenage Anne Cecil (Amy Kwolek), daughter of William, a marriage that never produced any lasting satisfaction for either party.

As we return to present time, Oxford is forced to hide his identity because of the biting satire of his plays that lampoon some of the more prominent members of the court, and also as a result of a political arrangement that becomes clearer later in the film. His initial choice to front for him is the same Ben Jonson but Jonson refuses, passing the mantle to Will Shakespeare (Rafe Spall), an actor for the Lord Chamberlain's Men who seizes the opportunity. In a superbly comic performance, Spall portrays Will as an illiterate money-grubber who can barely speak coherently but is willing to sell his name to Oxford at a premium cost. The heart of the plot, however, focuses on the attempt to seize power from Cecil's son Robert, an episode that is known to history as The Essex Rebellion of 1601.

This insurrection, led by Robert Devereaux, the Second Earl of Essex (Sam Reid) results in his beheading and the imprisonment of Southampton who is sent to the Tower awaiting certain death. Oxford's attempt to persuade Elizabeth to save their son results in a political deal that makes us privy to why Oxford was never able to reveal his authorship of the Shakespeare canon. While some critics may proclaim the movie a moment of singularity that indicates the end of the world as we know it (even before 2012), Anonymous may have the opposite effect, opening the subject to a wider audience who may be able to view Shakespeare and his times from a totally new perspective.

In Robert Heinlein's ""Stranger in a Strange Land,"" Jubal said we're prisoners of our early indoctrinations, ""for it is hard, very nearly impossible, to shake off one's earliest training."" If my intuition is correct, the prison gates will soon be swinging wide open, and the shaking will begin in earnest.

My favorite movies are Shawshank, Green mile, Benny&Joon, THHGTG, Lord of the Rings. I can enjoy History of the World part I, Robin Hood, Spartacus, Gladiator, and others that take history as inspiration... yet deviate for entertainment purposes.
The good things about those movies were that they were internally consistent.

I wanted to see this movie to see how the anti-Strats would bring their message, and I have to say not very well.
But halfway the movie, I found myself not caring... not caring whatsoever, if the Spanish Armada had shown up and won the day (not all that unusual in the fictional history in this movie) and I was asked if the characters in the movie had to be spared?? My answer would probably be which answer ends this movie faster.

The images are great mind you that is why it gets a few points but the characters, not one of them I could care about. The queen was too dumb to be a secret mother of all those boys (no girls as far as I could tell but I didn't care, remember) and too much into bedding everything in pants and not interested in state which seems to be unusually odd. DeVere was unbelievable in his attempt to put politics in plays without the ones paid to spot it finding out, while the commoners of London spotted it immediately.... And for an author with so many brilliant comedic plays and scenes, this representation does not have any sense of humour at all.

Shakespeare was way to uneducated and dumb to be a convincing front-man. Jonson... odd, a man of the theater not recognizing good/great plays when he sees it?? Marlowe, in very good shape for a man dead for years... (sorry but that was so totally stupid, the death of Marlowe was Shakespeare's opening in playwriting)

The film begins with a modern-day theater where Derek Jacobi introducing a ""play"" or the main part of the film, in which the 17th century playwright Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armesto) is being chased by the army of Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury (Edward Hogg) looking for certain manuscripts. Then starts a flashback, and then another. The muddled narrative keeps us busy following what is going on. In short, Shakespeare is, according to ""Anonymous,"" is only a ""front.""

Whether you believe Shakespeare was really a ""fraud"" (as the film's poster says) or not, there is one thing you are certain of. Director Roland Emmerich is best known for his bombastic visual style in action-packed disaster films, and I like ""Independence Day"" for its simple storytelling and tongue-in-cheek humor, but considering the complex narrative structure of ""Anonymous,"" he is not the right choice.

""Anonymous,"" visually impressive as it is, with muddy streets of London and Lisy Christl's Oscar nominated costume design, storytelling is complicated more than necessary. As a thriller or a drama ""Anonymous"" simply lacks the slick narrative that is necessary to draw the viewers into the film's conspiracy-filled world.

As many online reviewers have already pointed out, there are so many departures from fact in the film (the most notable being the one about the cause of dramatist Christopher Marlowe's death). I know the historical accuracy isn't the most important thing in this political thriller, and I also know Hollywood studios often do this for dramatic effect. But what dramatic effect?

""Anonymous"" takes itself so seriously, adding a Greek tragedy touch to the convoluted storyline. Though actors are doing their best, there is no reason for us to care about these bland characters. I would rather listen to Sir Derek Jacobi reciting Shakespeare's sonnets for two hours.",1360281600,5,2151,5.370919881305638
4978310,4,B0068MNNOE,"Roland Emmerich's film ""Anonymous"" is  worth a look. It resurrects one side of the Shakespeare authorship question by introducing the mass audience to the theory that Edward De Vere, the Earl of Oxford, was Shakespeare's ghost writer. If you are an ""Oxfordian"" this may be the movie for you, not for what it substantiates but for what it dramatizes.

I have not paid any attention to the Shakespeare authorship controversy and I continue to remain indifferent to the conclusions of either camp. The fact of the inimitable plays is proof enough for me that there was a committed hand and a matchless imagination behind them. Whether it was Devere, Bacon, Marlowe, or Shakespeare himself is less important for a viewer who judges the merit of a film by the story it tells.  I enjoyed the film, because it takes a position on the authorship question, extracts the dramatic core of the theory and does a great job of movingly telling a story of an unparalleled life committed to art. The film evokes the fun, the labor, the inspiration, and the obsession behind the astonishing feat that is the Shakespeare (or according to this film, the Devere) corpus.

The fast paced dramatic narrative is not only entertaining but also imbued with pathos of the story of an artistic life consumed by genius. There are the usual maladies that a big budget Hollywood film suffers from. The director, Roland Emmerich, one of the leading lights of Hollywood, has built his reputation with big budget disaster/science fiction productions (his resume includes ""Independence Day"", ""The Day after tomorrow"", and ""2012""). Even if we continue to get plenty of spectacle and sensationalism here the pathos of the story of the obscure, anonymous, artist shines through. What Emmerich leaves us in this version of the genesis of Shakespeare's plays is the universal tale of the tragedy of the artist.

Emmerich's films have their place in world cinema and I am glad that a person of his talent has made a film on Shakespeare's plays. The story that unfolds about Devere as author is an intriguing possibility. Plausibility is what is aimed at here given the fact that the life of the author of these plays will always be shrouded in mystery. Even if this fictional recount of the genesis of the greatest plays in the English language is not history, the major premise of this story is plausible. The film meets that delicate balance of truth and fiction. Any perceived factual weaknesses in the script is adequately balanced by the authentic telling of the story of an artist passionately committed to his art. Stories like this are valuable reminders that legacy of an artist can transcend history and its petty squabbles, and poetic truth is ever at odds with historic truth.

The film brings us top notch performances from Sebastian Armesto as Ben Johnson, Vanessa Redgrave as the aged Queen Elizabeth, Joely Richardson as the young Queen Elizabeth, David Thewlis as William Cecil, and Edward Hogg as Robert Cecil. The guy who plays DeVere (Rhys Ifans) is quite brilliant and Rafe Spall as ""Will"" Shakespeare is amusingly appropriate for the role of a dumbed down fraud who happily took the credit for Devere's labors. To take the film on its own terms is important in order to appreciate Ifans's portrayal of DeVere as a person who lives for his art and nothing else. The idea that anyone can live solely for art even if it comes at the cost (or from the artistic/political point of view - benefit) of near universal anonymity drives the pathos of this ""biography"". The obscurity that is the lot of the genuine artist is hardly a deterrent for the passion of  genius. Genius, this story repeatedly reminds us, disdains acclaim, honor, and embraces fate even if that turns out to be tragic. The pathos of cheerfully embracing the dismal lot of genius is the transcendent theme of this story.

Director Roland Emmerich's greatest merit is to evoke the passion of the artist to life for us. ""Anonymous"" reminds me of Peter Shaffer's ""Amadeus"" for its soaring tribute to the spirit of the artist who composes his works, not for popular aclaim, but for a much more deeper source of validation. Devere writes because he must. Only an inner compulsion to delight the audience explains the creative act that is the Devere/Shakespeare corpus. Devere desperately wants to entertain the popular audience with his plays but we movingly see how the deeper notes of his plays stuns not only the festive crowd into a thoughtful silence but the greatest poets of the age - from Marlowe to Jonson - who look at the performances of his plays with envy and awe.

Devere we learn in the end is seeking validation from one solitary voice. In this case, Devere's audience of one will be Ben Jonson, who we have repeatedly seen being stunned by the artistry of Devere's plays. He is floored at the end of each performance like his distinguished peer, Marlowe. The scene with Devere at his death bed with everything lost - his office, reputation, honor, his son - outwitted by the Machiavellian Robert Cecil shows at once the peculiar liberty of the anonymous artist and the agony of his isolation. But the divinely unconcerned look in the dying Devere despite losing everything confirms his rising hope in the legacy of his words. His real worry is to secure the posthumous life of his words. He does not seem to be bothered about restoring the rightful authorship of these plays under his name. Honor is a distant concern; the survival of his art is only obsession. As an artist he is happy to stay invisible; he is at peace despite betrayal and dispossession. The only endorsement Devere seeks is Ben Jonson's verdict of his plays.

Jonson's ecstatic note of acknowledgement that the poetry, the words, are the most wondrous he has heard, and his confidence that those plays will continue to amaze future readers, is a scene of great dramatic power. This is the high point of the film. Devere's story may end up in obscurity but the plays will transcend his age; his writings will soar past the political intrigues and conspiracies of the age and live for all ages. Ultimately the wider audience will keep the meaning of these plays alive and well. The author is unimportant but his literary legacy will never be condemned to anonymity.

Mainstream films that attempt to resurrect the life of genius this way ought to be encouraged. Films that entertain can also happily bring with it moments of surprise. If only films like this could be brought to screen more often and be a more regular part of Hollywood's friday night fare, we would perhaps have more readers taking up Shakespeare. The story brought to life here is not unlike a Shakespearean play - with themes that resonate with a popular audience. The film, like the plays, offers subterfuge, deceit, war, obsession, love, friendship, loyalty, and betrayal, the ingredients for great drama; but there are also moments of moral redemption and loftiness, with the narrative offering an eloquent argument for the high value of the uncompromising artistic life utterly devoted to art.

Roland Emmerich's ""Anonymous"" is a film of undeniable emotional power. This retelling of the ""Oxfordian theory"" should be seen with reasonable expectations, and by this I mean, the claims of the story offered here ought not to be seen as a serious excursion into history. ""Anonymous"" shines as a story passionately told about a writer in love with writing, who seemingly disdained authorship by risking complete anonymity, to create the greatest poetry of the Elizabethan age.",1358812800,3,7570,4.882490272373541
4978311,1,B0068MNNOE,"This film is based on a false, ridiculous premise. That the aristocratic Eddie de Vere wanted to write plays for the public theater, but did not want to put his name on them because the upper class folks don't associated with the low-lifes that are in the theater business. .  Hey, the guy was a patron of two boy groupes of actors, and was noted by Meres to be a writer of comedies. Hardly a suppression of evidence.

  The point of all this is that there were many anonymous plays at all times during Shakespeare's era.  He only wrotee two plays a year. His troupe may have performed some of his past plays, but they also needed new plays, even from anonymous authors. as this list shows. Some were no doubt better than others.  But de Vere certainly did not need to pay Shakespeare to put his name on plays.  The concept is totally, incomprehensible, does not make sense, and is not relevant with events in Shakespeare's world, as this list shows.

I am not a film critic, so I will not judge the acting, directing, set design, sounds effects, costumes, and the rest....actually, I don't think that this film will convince anybody who wasn't already convinced.  If it actually did some intellectual damage on viewers, they did not have much inside anyway.

The case for Eddie de Vere has not improved in 100 years. In Bill Bryson's words""

""In short, it is possible, with a kind of selective squinting, to endow the alternative claimants with the necessary time, talent, and motive for anonymity to write the plays of William Shakespeare.  But no one has ever produced the tiniest particle of evidence that they actually did so.""

""Looney never produced evidence to explain why Oxford, a man of boundless vanity, would seek to hide his identity.""  ....""All Looney would say is 'That, however, is his business, not ours"".

Of course, as Ogburn anticipated, Shakespeare will have to be decapitated before Eddie de Vere is made the King. And Ogburn took the torch from Delia Bacon, calling Will an illiterate country bumbkin, with absolutely no evidence that his was true, but facts did not bother Ogburtn.  What he wanted to believe, that was his own truth.

No records that Will attended school...therefore he didn't.  That was current for awhile.  Without attending school, it is very unlikely that he would have been able to write the plays.  But ""absence of evidence is not evidence of absence"" and if you know anything about John Shakespeare, you are pretty sure he would have walked his son to his first day of school and made sure he stayed there.

So now we have a literate person, who can translate Latin, knows some rhetoric, and who is ready to go to London to write plays....ButWAIT...

A new book comes out that does not deny that Will went to school, but that the school was more inferior than is stated in most biographies make out...

And so it goes on...he had to have visited Italy...he had to have been a lawyer...he had to have gone to a Univeristy...he had to have been in the military....My God! If Will had done all that, when would he have found time to write the plays and sonnets?

This entire bogus discussion will go on for another century, perhaps more claimants will arise....But Shakespeare's name will remain on the plays, mainly because HE WROTE THEM....",1358726400,9,4694,4.913486005089059
4978312,4,B0068MNNOE,"Anonymous takes a popular conspiracy theory about the identity of Shakespeare, mixes it intelligently with some clever parallels in his plays and gives the audience one of the strongest historical thrillers in years. The film moves around timelines mercilessly, introduces a range of characters quickly and doesn't do anything to spoon feed or talk down to the audience. It's extremely well plotted and gives the viewer plenty to think about, even if you never believed the rumors about Shakespeare in the first place.

Considering this comes from the director of The Day After Tomorrow and 10,000 BC, the movie also demonstrates a near-perfect use of computer graphics sequences that recreate a long-gone era flawlessly (it's truly hard to believe these aren't elaborate sets). This is aided by the production design generally to illustrate one of the richest backdrops for historical fiction that I've seen in years.

So was this really directed by a Hollywood elite who couldn't be named for political reasons so he handed it off to a much less capable director? Probably not but if this really is Roland Emmerich's work, in reality I have to commend him on producing one of the best films of the year.

4978346,5,B0068MNNOE,"To really get the most out of ANONYMOUS, you'll need to go into the film with a few things handy in memory. First, you'll need a basic knowledge of Shakespeare's plays. Not ALL of them or anything, just some of the mainstays like HAMLET, MACBETH, HENRY V, and maybe RICHARD III. Second, you'll need to know a little bit about theater during the Elizabethan Era, and that Ben Jonson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VOLPONE-and-THE-ALCHEMIST/dp/0486436306/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VOLPONE and THE ALCHEMIST</a>) and Christopher Marlowe (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DOCTOR-FAUSTUS/dp/0486282082/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DOCTOR FAUSTUS</a>) would have occupied the same circles as Shakespeare. Third, you'll have to know a little bit about what the film is trying to accomplish. Though it sets things up plainly enough, that perhaps that man we call Shakespeare may have had little to no part in writing the plays we're all aware of in some way, it doesn't really explicitly start pinning authorship on Edward de Vere until a ways into the story. By then so much is flying around, it's easy to miss that subtle build up.

It was for me, at least - and I don't claim to have known everything listed above when I first watched the film. It took a bit of research! But that's what I love about ANONYMOUS, that it's drawing upon so much to tell a story so unique to that era. Is it historically accurate? Well, about as much as SCHINDLER'S LIST. That is to say much of what happens here actually happened, but things are definitely skewed for the sake of drama. But it's fantastic drama!

There are two storylines at work here, with the primary belonging to Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford. He's our tormented artist and the man for which the film is building the case of authorship. He's a member of the English court, the upper crust, and, as such, is supposed to carry himself a certain way. Unfortunately, this does not extend to his writings, which are seen a kind of taboo. Nevertheless, he does continue writing in private, and enlists the aid of Ben Jonson, whom the other half of the film follows. de Vere wishes to see his plays performed, but cannot put his own name on them, so he asks Jonson to have them performed in his name.

Unfortunately, mistakes were made, and a drunken actor named William Shakespeare ends up taking full credit for the plays we all know and love.

The film continues to follow the growing popularity of de Vere's plays, while giving us insight into his childhood and formal education, from which he drew inspiration for his works. All of this against the background of an unstable political climate being created by Queen Elizabeth's deteriorating health, leaving the next heir to the throne in question. Throw in a few twists and turns that absolutely shocked me and you have some fantastic drama.

The story for ANONYMOUS is marvelously written by John Orloff, one of the writers of BAND OF BROTHERS, and directed by Roland Emmerich, who steps up his game tremendously to deliver a film that more than complements the screenplay. Emmerich, an aficionado of ""popcorn flicks"", doesn't drift towards drama too often, preferring large scale disaster/action films, but when he wants drama in front of his camera, he gets it. As such, nearly all of the actors and actresses here turn in A grade performances across the board, with special mention of Rhys Ifans, whose depiction of Edward de Vere manages to channel the torment of an artist born into the wrong station, and the passion of a man who could write HAMLET. I also really enjoyed Rafe Spall's hilarious take on William Shakespeare, not the man who would write HAMLET, but a man who would eventually leave his ""second best bed"" to his wife in his will.

All of this to say: I really enjoyed this film. It's clear that everyone in front of and behind the camera were really passionate about the source material. It's detailed enough to be historical but, to a Stratfordian, could even be counted as pleasant alternate history. Thankfully, ANONYMOUS doesn't require you to take its side over the other because, at the end of the day, it's still a celebration of the works we know as ROMEO AND JULIET, TWELFTH NIGHT, and A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (complete with accurate performances of the plays) and concedes that although the authorship of the plays is in question, the impact they've had on the world is undeniable.",1350604800,7,4486,4.998661311914324

4978349,1,B0068MNNOE,"A tale told by an Emmerich is likely to be full of sound, special effects and fury signifying very little indeed.  Roland Emmerich's film ""The Day After Tomorrow"", which collected carbon credits from the global warming community that was engaging world government politicians at the time of the film's release, depicted a world where the seas rose and froze, so that outside the windows of the New York Public Library a great oil tanker hove to and froze there.  Readers trapped inside the building warmed themselves in the stacks by consigning all the priceless volumes to the flames; all but the last copy of Gutenberg's 1455 Bible, that an extra from the cast of thousands was clutching (in a gross Emmerich touch) to his heart, to save for posterity. Before ""Anonymous"", this sentimental touch marked the highpoint of Roland's engagement with early printed literature.

After demurely treading the red carpet, past a vision of the beautiful back of Joely Richardson; it was evident on the evening of October 26th, 2011, as Roland Emmerich himself introduced us to the cast, before its first showing at The Mayfair Hotel Gala Premiere, of ""Anonymous"" at The Empire Leicester Square, that the personable Roland has a serviceable but Berlitz grasp of the English language.  This did not bode well for lovers of English literature, even though, next, we were advised by a luminary of the British Film Institute that we were in for a ""rare treat"" that would, despite the nature of the subject matter, also be ""thrilling"".  After it was all over, the audience dutifully clapped as the credits rolled.  As we rushed to burst out of the fire exit doors into London's night air, we heard the same labourers at the coalface of the entertainment business, working a little louder with their picks and shovels as the name of Rhys Ifans and that same Joely Richardson went by.

Joely Richardson herself, seated in front of us, was in a good position to see that there were many empty seats in the imposing arena.  Perhaps it was this realisation that galvanised that moiety, determined to have a good time, to make up with laughter for points when her execrable colleague, cast as the man from Stratford (Timothy Spall), made up to look like the Stratford Monument, failed to entertain in the least. The film might have brought the issue of authorship into the fogs of daylight at last. I understand, in a protest from orthodox scholars, when the film was released, that the statue of the husband of Ann Hathaway in Stratford was covered for the opening day, in a white sheet.  Here we have Stanley Wells, winding his dynamo for one last bicycle-lamp-flicker of publicity before he joins Halliwell-Phillips in the similarly white-sheeted and gated community of old scholars in the sky.

Edward de Vere is however a worthy creation, a beautiful man, a sensitive man; but larded by Orloff with ludicrous words more suited to an English North Country disc jockey with a cigar.  The nadir of his delivery must be when he explains to his unsupportive wife, late in this execrable piece of work: ""I hear these voices in my head and I have to write them down."" There is none of the ""monstrous adversary"" that Nelson documented; nothing of the charismatic jousting champion, the great gold and vermilion knight of the sun and the East Anglian superstar.  The idea that he is actually the son of Queen Elizabeth, the old boot he also manages to copulate with, against all the odds of the folds of fabric which she is beset by, was surely designed to attract derision.

Mark Rylance, by his own admission, never reads his reviews.  This inclination probably informs the worst of his work; which was plumbed when he walked around, like a Hever brass rubbing of Thomas Bullen, in ""The Other Boleyn Girl"".  Mark, upstaged once more by the vasty fields of his own costume, as he was on the cover of the recent book ""Dating Shakespeare"", appeared once more for us in a great pair of pantaloons; this time mincing the speech that opens Henry V: ""O for a muse of fire"".  Is it possible that such a magical introduction describing itself the essence of theatre, such instantly engaging words, such inspired words, will ever be brought down so low again?  As Mark opens his mouth, was there ever a more piping or a more wooden ""O""?

The film is a travesty.  Oxfordians have waited a long time for it, full of hope that it might be a sincere attempt to present theories about the nature of the writer we know as Shakespeare; that themselves might be illuminating even if we did not agree with them.  In the current climate, I am hard put to mention that John Orloff (may his tribe increase) scripts the recent non-Catholic word ""bloody"" for use; but that cullion word celebrated by The Sex Pistols also puts in an appearance; anachronisms as out of place, as Kate Winslet giving ""the finger"" on her way to steerage as the lift door closes for the film ""Titanic"".  It's an egregious insult to the intelligence of any audience strapped in to take it lying down.

Perhaps this film, by making such a derisory fiction of what has occupied Oxfordians, and the likes of Nina Green and Peter W.Dickson, for so long, beyond the calls of reason; will bring an end to the Sisyphean struggle because it has all been made, in one powerful sweep of the mighty cinema, to appear so nonsensical.

The IMDB.com encyclopaedic database, reports that the film has an estimated budget of $30,000,000; but in its first month took only $4,152,954 (USA) (20 November 2011).  This very frosty response of the cinema-going hordes is not computer-generated. It is the real thing that slowly freezes pipes; a blockbuster. The film will need more than Derek Jacobi's scarf to keep out, for everyone associated with the film, future encroachments of this cold.",1348963200,8,5802,4.779
4978360,4,B0068MNNOE,"I first learned about this controversy after reading an article by essayist and editor Joseph Sobran in National Review (NR) in 1991. Suddenly many murky questions I had about William Shakespeare became very clear. The real author of his plays, Sobran claimed, was Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, a very learned man and a literary scholar but whose authorship of those plays was not acceptable for a man of his rank. Rhys Ifans is magnificent in his role as the Earl of Oxford.

The veracity and revisionism of the Sobran article was answered in a subsequent NR issue by none other than Charlton Heston, who vigorously defended Shakespeare and the accepted conventional historical account.

The movie is magnificently made, the acting and cast superb, the setting (e.g. the Globe Theater, circa 1600 London, etc.) and cinematography outstanding, but the historical additions and elaborations, interwoven with pompous fictional exuberance, detract from the more serious literary debate. So I for one was disappointed for example when as someone else wrote Queen Elizabeth I was transformed in the film from the austere, dignified Tudor Virgin Queen, who placed the throne and England above everything else, to a young, fluttering nymphomaniac monarch butterfly and later to a befuddled old hag of a queen.

In those days of the Renaissance when monarchs had no real private lives, Queen Elizabeth I could not have been another Catherine the Great without the court and courtiers knowing of her sexual liaisons and gossipy peccadilloes, nor could she have prevented these transgressions from seeping into the fabric of historical accounts.

Likewise, the character of William Shakespeare, the literary wraith, is needlessly distorted beyond belief for the purpose of contrast and the sensationalization of the film.

The elaboration and interweaving of fictitious events leading to the Earl of Oxford as one of the former lovers of the queen and whose sexual consummation led to the bastardy of the Earl of Southampton also adds to our sense of disbelief.

I recommend a little homework for those who seek historical accuracy before watching this movie. Look up the main historical characters and learn a bit about them, i.e., Queen Elizabeth; the Earls of Essex and Southampton; William Cecil and Robert Cecil, his son; Ben Jonson; and of course the Earl of Oxford and William Shakespeare.

If one watches this movie with a sense for historical accuracy, not to mention if seeking clarification as to the dispute of who actually wrote the Shakespearean plays -- the film is disappointing. Admirers of Queen Betsy will be enraged. Ben Jonson fans will be delighted. Those seeking historical entertainment and those who enjoy alternative history for its sake - will be entertained. Those who watch historical films to learn history and use that ""history"" for conversational purposes will be deceived, and will be unwitting deceivers to others, unless they are careful historical connoisseurs, who can separate very carefully the wheat from the chaff in this fictionalized historical movie!

This film struck very much the same chord as Oliver Stone's '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JFK/dp/B004FQX59I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JFK</a>' - an extremely well-executed, high quality production that, if my read is correct, a consensus majority of academics and historians dismiss.

I claim absolutely no insight into Elizabethan Politics and any struggle for the British throne four-hundred years ago, but simply judge this as a standalone production. Additionally, I have a zero stake in the on-going battle between Oxfordians and Shakespearean Traditionalists. So tossing academic molotov cocktails at my review gains you nothing. Jusy sayin'.

'Anonymous' is a sumptuously crafted and textually rich film; one of the few movies where I can say I truly enjoyed this period of history without bloodshed. It's not populist opinion, but I tend to prefer modern interpretations of the Middle-Ages that involve a bit of bladework, shields, flails, and a truncheon mace or two. Not necessarily all-out warfare, but the 16th and 17th Centuries without plagues, fecal-filled streets and the occasional strutting wench tends to wear on my patience, 'The Tudors' notwithstanding.

A superbly staged drama with fascinating suggestions of a lost history, illuminating several arguments and posits about the authorship of the works attributed to William Shakespeare. Again, this review simply addresses the film itself and not its place in history. There's real enchantment involved as Director Roland Emmerich deftly and completely pulls us into a time of political turmoil and royal intrigue - and punishment by death for any who dare expose or challenge its secrets.

One of the court, Sir Edward De Vere, The Earl of Oxford, has for the entirety of his life disavowed his heritage - dodging court politics and avoiding fiscal endeavors. Why? Forced to suffocate his true calling - to write - he draws out his days with no effort to maintain his estates or manage his affairs. The passion he's forced to sublimate kills his sense of life, becoming listless, bored and withdrawn. But despite a lifelong effort to resist the urge of pen and quill, his passion overcomes his better sense; secretly reaching out to established playwright Ben Jonson, he makes a deal. Paid to be a cut-out, Jonson will front for the noble, allowing his words to be publicly fielded and enjoyed while the earl maintains his anonymity and proper societal standing.

And that's how things would've stayed, except, a confluence in history is about to take place.

As the rule of childless Elizabeth The First reaches its twilight, the battle for the throne of England dawns. And it's Sir Edward who stands at the nexus.

With no legal heir, various factions begin to plot their choice for the throne. None more ambitious than Robert Cecil, prime counselor and advisor to the crown. A machiavellian plan put into action by the infamous humpbacked bureaucrat, intent on insuring his continued existence at court by installing a distaff cousin to Elizabeth as the heir apparent, circumventing her majesty's expressed wishes for his own benefit. Her isolation Cecil's greatest tool, as the hump whispers lies and half-truths in order to maintain control of the royal succession.

His plan requires the removal of the one of the leading candidates, Sir Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl Of Essex. And guiltly by association, Sir Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton - unknown to all but three people - as the illegitimate child born of the union between Edward and Elizabeth.

After the failure of a direct action assassination attempt, Cecil plots to have Robert and Henry accused of treason against crown and state.

Cornered with no visible way out, the pair seek out Sir Edward for advice. Having insinuated himself to young Henry as a family friend and court ally, it's his sage wisdom that has guided his son over the years. And to save both from the executioner's block - he intends on exposing the treacherous plan to remove them from the line of succession.

In a final bid to reach the queen's heart, Edward employs his only skill - the written word. Quickly producing ""The Tragedy Of King Richard The Third"" - a thinly disguised jab, scathing admonition and outright mockery of his hunched nemesis. Edward's plan is to inflame the populace, delivering vox populi, vox dei - as the people are already aware of the seedy dark manipulations to install James VI Of Scotland as their new king; a northern royal that many English feel is a foreign-born usurper only remotely related to the bloodline.

However, his plans go awry with the unintentional interference by the angry and jealous proxy. Unaware of the larger game being played and hurt by Shakespeare's undeserved fame and accolades, Jonson inadvertently alerts the power brokers of De Vere's intentions. Outmaneuvered and outplayed by Cecil - the execution of the Earl Of Essex as a traitor means his efforts, both private and public, are dealt an unsurvivable blow. He's lost all. His attempt at saving the British crown for an Englishman, giving Henry a place at court, and preserving his legacy are utterly destroyed.

All that remains are his words.

Oh yes, almost forgot about William Shakespeare. In this proposed alternate history, an insipid and illiterate stage actor who bumbles into the secret of Sir Edward's playwright proxy. With moronic bravery born out of ignorance and avarice - grabs ahold of the notoriety, revels in the infamy and happily blackmails Sir Edward for hush money to maintain the popular pretense. That's it. A hack whom history should've placed as a footnote, instead stands at the illustrious center spotlight, heralded as the greatest English writer in history.

And in the context of this production: Dramatic irony that Sir Edward would likely find quite amusing.",1348876800,4,5890,5.210359408033827
4978362,4,B0068MNNOE,"First of all, both the cinematography and characterization in ""Anonymous"" are outstanding. The scenes of London, circa 1600--particularly those of the Globe Theater--are truly stunning. All of the cast are quite natural in their roles, and Redgrave, Armesto, and Spall give exquisite performances as, respectively, Elizabeth I, Ben Jonson, and Shakespeare. This is one of the few films I've seen where the great (alleged?) playwright himself plays a prominent role, and it's fascinating to see Shakespeare as he may very well have been. If you are interested enough to read a review of this film in the first place, watching ""Anonymous"" should prove to be a rewarding experience.

With a very general knowledge of Shakespeare's life and his more famous plays (particularly ""Hamlet"") and some of the more famous historical characters--Ben Jonson, Christopher Marlowe, the Earl of Oxford, and a few others--I was able to get the basic gist of what was going on in ""Anonymous"" and appreciate its dramatic twists and surprises. Still, it helped to stop the film and consult Charles Boyce's excellent commentary-encyclopedia, ""Shakespeare."" I might recommend reading up a little (a quick google should be sufficient) on the lives of Shakespeare himself, Elizabeth I, and perhaps most importantly, Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, before watching this.

While it's important to remember that this is a work of fiction(and some of the details are certainly inaccurate), the basic story it presents seems plausible. One would have to be quite an expert on Elizabethan England in order to fully understand the complex political situations presented here. Nevertheless, all the details and intimations leave room for multiple viewings of ""Anonymous,"" noticing new things every time.",1348272000,3,1780,5.376344086021505
4978363,5,B0068MNNOE,"I watched this movie without a clue as to its premise. I can only speak to the entertainment value of this film and not to its historical accuracy.  Many of the reviewers of this film and some of my friends critique the film because of the historical flaws or inaccuracies in its presentation. Having no knowledge of the critique of Shakesperien authorship, I cannot comment or address that issue.

Anonymous is an entertaining and thought provoking film which posits that the Earl of Oxford was the actual author of the Shakespearien corpus. The plot deals with the court intrigues and amorous adventures of Queen Elisabeth I of England and her commoner advisers, the Cecils. The Cecils oppose theater as an unwholesome and subversive activity forcing the Earl to conceal his identity as the author.  Oxford uses his plays as a political commentary which eventually lead to unexpected consequences.  Whether Anonymous is fact or fiction matters not.  It is a thoughtful engaging film regardless of its historical authenticity.

I never heard of Rhys Ifans or Edward Hogg before I saw this movie, but they gave outstanding performances.  The other actors were also strong.  The only character that did not seem to fit in the film was Shakespeare himself which I am sure was intentional to make believable his inability to pen such great literature.

With no preconceived ideas, with no search to find answers, viewing this movie was a great experience.  I actually think it is the best movie I have seen so far this year 2012. If you are looking for a well acted, intriguing historical drama this is a good choice.

Some cautions:  Some people say it is slow moving and/or hard to follow.  Yes it can be, and I did have to watch it twice to fully appreciate it. It does take above average attentiveness to stay in the flow of the storyline but it was well worth it.",1345507200,4,1865,4.7725856697819315
4978364,1,B0068MNNOE,"William Shakespeare is not the author of the ""Shakespearean Portfolio"", just let me get that out of the way.

But this film, filled with all kinds of plots and intrigues is just plain laughable, or would be were it not for the mere fact that I dozed off at several points throughout the film.

You know, could anyone expect anything less from Roland Emmerich?  A man whose known film making style is to put implausible but superstitious material on screen for teenagers (and teenagers at heart) to soak up and enjoy?

Well, I'm not a teenager anymore, thank goodness, and when I first heard about this film I was enthused to see what kind of story would be presented on the screen.  But, there were flags.  The actors at the press junket was a big one; ""acting"" (to coin a phrase) as if they were outraged that the material they were presenting had been ""hidden"" for so long by so few and accepted by so many (to borrow from another Brit, W. Churchill).  I really didn't think anything of it at the time, and merely fobbed it off as just more dramatics to sell the film.

Then I see the film.  I give a collective ""huh"", and leave the theatre wondering if the entire crew and company think that those of us who doubt Shakespeare's literary veracity are merely a bunch of nut cases.

But, you know what?  I don't care.

William Shakespeare had lots of education and inherit intelligence.  He was not a dumb man.  But he did not write nor create the artistry in the so labelled ""Shakespeare Portfolio"".  His education was in commerce and legal procedures, it was not in the pass-times of Elizabethan's ""Rich and Famous"" (again, to coin a phrase).  Nor was it in astronomy, military matters, international relations, Mediterranean social morays, and a host of other things found in the Shakespearean portfolio that are needed in order to write those works.

And, on the screen, it's even worse.  Instead of a Shakespeare who seems to have been a family man in spite of his legal wrangles with other merchants, we're given a slovenly womanizer who extorts money from De Vere.

The film goes on about court intrigue, who is sleeping with whom, and pretty much every paranoid fantasy that one could ever have about the people involved with those works at that time.

It really amazes me that anyone would presume that because an individual doubted one facet of that era regarding ""Shakespeare"", that therefore said individual BELIEVED in ALL of the paranoid crap that was put into this movie.

The Raisuli take on Shakeseare; he was a producer, and this seems to make sense as he had a lot of experience in dealing with people in a court of law, as well as dealing in money, notably grains.  He probably had a legal reputation that kept people  from suing him and his theatre troupe for libel and slander.  The works were probably produced under him as ""the author"" because he was the man bringing the resources to the stage, but nothing beyond that.

How on Earth this manifests into riots and mass slaughters on the London bridge and elsewhere, and transpires into murders and cover ups is really beyond the scope of my imagination.

But, some Over-The-Top German decides to produce a paranoid driven film, and ""Anonymous"" is what we get.

It's truly a piece of well produced garbage.  See it once for the art direction.

Otherwise trash it, or leave it on the shelf.  Your brain will thank you for the rest of your life.",1344470400,5,3417,4.618573797678275
4978365,2,B0068MNNOE,"Okay, I am a bit of a bardophile, so I was looking forward to watching this.  I like to see the bard and his works talked about from any number of different angles.  But if this movie had been a stool, it would be missing all but one leg.  The images were compelling and the other visual historical details were compelling (excepting visual historical mistakes, such as the singed cover of ""Henry V"" from the ashes of the theater, because the play had been performed before Edward's death).  Otherwise, the movie was a lumbering, clumsy, vindictive, pile of preposterousness.  God only knows why the anti-Shakespearean theories continue (although James Shapiro attempts to explain that in his book, ""Contested Will""), but only deluded conspirators could find much to love in this.  The evidence to support Shakespeare is considerable and beats anything that I have seen from the opposition.  Still, this movie would just have been little more than a conspirator's delight had the movie leaked so much internally.

For instance, Derek Jacobi, the actor, tells the audience that William had only a grammar school education.  But then the film portrays him as illiterate.  So which is it?  And of course, we can historically document the first claim, but the not the second.  What purpose would the claim of illiteracy (and to portray Shakespeare as a feckless, money-grubbing buffoon, again, without evidence) serve except to rev up the base of true believers.  If you're in a battle, it isn't enough to defeat your opponent; you must humiliate him as wel...

It also made Queen Elizabeth -- by all accounts a brilliant and cunning leader -- a credulous pawn of the Cecils, and blinkered ruler in general.  And yet again, the producers employed the humiliation strategy, coming with a preposterous and completely unfounded calumny toward the queen and pitiful William.  Do the producers have Oedipal issues, perhaps?  It also doesn't make sense that the Earl would give into Shakespeare's blackmail either.  Isn't the Earl supposed to be so much more clever than anyone else?  Then why would he consent to pay WS?  WS has no bargaining leverage to speak of.  If he does what he threatens, he would lose everything (probably including his life).  This is Elizabethan England.  The Earl could have WS vanish, mafia-like, in no time and then simply find someone else to replace him (it was clear from the movie: any idiot could have done the job).

The acting was also unconvincing.  Was any audience member able to see the Earl as the author of some of the most beautiful, heartfelt prose in the world, especially the most romantic and sublime verses?  Moreover, a key assumption that the antishakespeareans make is that one can only write what one knows (a literary fashion mistake from the Romantic period); so, it goes, WS was not high enough born and well enough connected to know so much about kings and courts.  Somehow the Earl of Oxford fits this bill better.  But then the Oxfordians put the noose around their own necks with the charge, because WS ALSO wrote many characters from the peasant side -- and many in the middle.  How could that noble Earl know so much about them?

It's sad that this type of mularkey continues, with little more than wild speculation and willed blindness to evidence to keep it going, and that so many credulous have been pulled in.  Okay, it deserves as much of a place in the public conversation as creationism, anti-global warming, and Obama birthplace debates.  Crackpot ideas will be around as long as there are crackpots.  But this film isn't even for them!",1344470400,6,3598,4.874794069192752
4978366,3,B0068MNNOE,"So, if you are looking for an authenticated look at Shakespeare, look elsewhere.  This is a film that is obviously manipulated in many areas and serves for mere entertainment value at best.  It becomes apparent about halfway through that they aren't even trying to be logical here, but are merely trying to stir up controversy at every corner because that will keep people glued to the seats.  Sadly, the horrific acting almost made me want to get up and leave.

`Anonymous' raises doubt to the authenticity of Shakespeare's fame.  This is a theory that has been around for years.  In fact, in school we debated this in Litt. Class and so I was well aware with the idea that Shakespeare himself didn't actually pen those epic plays that serve as the basis for so many of what we see and read today.  In `Anonymous', those beautiful stories were penned by a prominent figure, the Earl of Oxford, who hid his love of poetry from those closest to him out of shame.  Raised in a household that forbid the arts, Edward de Vere (the Earl) was constantly battling his paternal figures until a scandal trapped him in a life he didn't necessarily desire.  Decades later, and he is searching for an outlet for his life's passion, and he finds that outlet in a young aspiring playwright named Ben Jonson.  Ben, reluctant to brandish his name to the works of the Earl, is taken aback when his friend William Shakespeare steals the credit and becomes an overnight sensation.  While the film could have easily focused on the plays themselves and the controversy surrounding their author, it wants to encompass more than that and so soon we are divided between this story and that of Queen Elizabeth's successor, or the pursuit of one.  The two are obviously interwoven in a way that feels oddly soap operatic by film's end, and the scandalous twists that are thrust at us in the finale are an obvious ploy at `one upping' Shakespeare himself.

It tries too hard.

Overall, this was interesting conceptually, but it wasn't entirely handled with care.  It gets choppy and a little lazy in the way that things are tied together, and the cast is atrocious here, outside of Rhys Ifans, who is enticing and compelling and heartfelt in his every delivery.  Vanessa Redgrave, whom I love, is oddly uneven here.  Sebastian Armesto tries far too hard to add gravel to his voice and sounds like an idiot.  Rafe Spall is repulsive.  Jamie Campbell Bower is oddly effeminate and acts like a little boy, which is unbecoming considering the man he is playing.  Joely Richardson pulls out her inner Cate Blanchett, and not the good kind, and basically overacts EVERYTHING.  I mean, this is like a cesspool of performances that makes me cringe the more I think of it.  But yes, Rhys Ifans might make my top twelve Supporting Actor ballot for 2011, he was that good (and that out of place here).

The film is beautiful to look at and rightfully garnered a Costume nomination at the Oscars, but the absurdity of the film's final plot lines and the performances contained make this a semi-mockery of a film.

He is such a versatile actor.",1343692800,3,365,4.6
4978368,5,B0068MNNOE,"I am rather new to this issue, and normally against most ""Conspiracy"" Theories; but IMHO, the Shakespeare Authorship Controversy IS a legitimate mystery.
If you listen to the commentary on this DVD, the film makers honestly admit that they took liberties with the factual record while making this movie. They acknowledge several of those liberties, and openly imply that there are others that they didn't elaborate on. This is one reason why I wish films like this would ALWAYS include additional commentaries by 'real' historians who comment on the facts relating to the action on-screen, but I'm not aware of ANY movie that has this type of commentary.

AS RELATES TO THE AUTHORSHIP QUESTION- IMHO there is little doubt that the man from Stratford-on-Avon is not the author of the works attributed to him.

(1) It is undisputed that the Stratford=Shakespeare was a well-known stage-actor, and part-owner of theater(s); but the record of him ACTUALLY writing those works, is mostly built on ASSUMPTIONS, i.e, that he simply MUST HAVE, written them.
Which is actually the same argument about his education. We KNOW nothing-nada-zip-zilch about his education, but, in a similar vein, the traditionalists insist that he certainly MUST HAVE gotten an education similar to what they propose.

(2) It is unknown about whether Stratford-Shakespeare was literate or not.
It is almost certain, that his father, who was, at various times in his life, VERY SUCCESSFUL in business, and in local politics, was illiterate, and signed legal documents using the method of ""making a mark"".
One of Stratford-Shakespeare's daughters seems to have been fairly literate, while the other one, probably not.
The Stratford-Shakespeare was VERY financially successful, and as a Stage-Actor, he certainly must have known how to read, in order to learn his lines.
BUT, in spite, of all the amazing output from ""Shakespeare-the-Author"", there is not one surviving document written by the hand of 'William Shakespeare' from Stratford-on-Avon, nor is there any known document that ever existed, and is now known to have been lost.
There is a very rich public record of many activities and events in the Statford-Shakespeare's life, but the only things in existence from his own hand, are SIX(6) signatures, all of which are virtually unrecognizable- AND THIS IS THE SMOKING GUN.

(3) IF THE MAN FROM STRATFORD DIDN'T WRITE THAT STUFF, WHO DID ??? There are lots of good theories, but none of them without problems. And this is a wonderful mystery to investigate, which will probably never be solved.

(4) FINALLY, I learned lots of little tidbits in from this film; mostly about the Cecil's",1342656000,3,2661,5.150462962962963
4978369,5,B0068MNNOE,"Like most folks, I never even considered that anyone but Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare. Thus, when I first heard about this movie, I dismissed it immediately as not worth my time.

What a mistake that was.

I still don't completely buy the theory presented in this movie, but, honestly, forget the theories and speculation and scholarly arguments and all that. Just WATCH the movie and don't let it raise your blood pressure and you will ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. It reminded me a lot of Immortal Beloved and Amadeus, two movies that don't make great history but do make PHENOMENAL films.

Rhys Ifans is just fantastic in this movie. If you remember him from movies like Notting Hill, Pirate Radio, or Enduring Love you won't recognize him here. He was THAT good (and ridiculously gorgeous *sigh*). He deserved an Oscar nod in my opinion. I completely fell head over heels in love with him watching this. And yes, I cried at the end. A lot.

Actually, the entire cast in this movie was spot on amazing. There wasn't a single performance I had any problems with.

I have to also mention the incredible special effects. We were literally looking at Elizabethan London from a helicopter. It was that convincing and so beautiful.

While the main story about Edward de Vere is beautiful, tragic and heartbreaking, what got to me most emotionally actually was the extreme reverence for the works. Just because the movie proposes a disliked theory doesn't mean that the author or director had anything whatsoever against the works themselves. Quite the contrary. They were treated with an almost holy reverence that really moved me.

When asked what he believed, Rhys Ifans responded that he thought there was some basis for the theory but ultimately that wasn't what mattered. Rather, he hoped that this movie would renew and refresh interest in Shakespeare, breathe some new life into the works, and make more people want to read up on the history themselves. It's certainly working on me, I went out and bought new copies of my favorite plays to read again.

Really, the only people who couldn't enjoy this, I think, are people who know WAY too much about the topic to put aside their knowledge or people who have trouble shutting off their analytical mind and just enjoying something beautiful.",1342137600,5,2285,4.856041131105399

4978371,4,B0068MNNOE,"The film 'Anonymous' was filmed using the latest in digital camera, the Arri Alexa (and not a Red One as has been suggested elsewhere).  I read that the Red One just didn't render the light practicals (the lights that are used in a scene rather than placed out of the scene) well; at least the candles which apparently were the main source of light for much of the film (as well, of course, exterior lighting).

The story has been related elsewhere completely and in detail, so I won't re-invent the wheel.  I will say that the story won't make as much sense to the person (like me) who has a poor understanding of the royal politics of the time (Queen Elizabeth and that time period of much intrigue).  I was more interested in the question of whether Shakespeare could have or did write the plays and sonnets he's credited with writing.

The set design and artistic interpretation is top-notch, making for a sumptuous film-going experience.  The acting was excellent as well, and features Rhys Ifans as the Earl of Oxford (the supposed author of the plays) and Vanessa Redgrave as Queen Elizabeth.

Over-all, the film would appeal more to the history buff, especially someone who is familiar with the English history of the time.  I know there is much criticism of the historical accuracy of the film, which I share.  Like Oswald being the single killer of Kennedy, I believe that Shakespeare did write all of the plays in question; as they say, extraordinary claims need extraordinary proof, which is lacking in this instance.

A riveting story told as an artfully unfolded patch-work puzzle of events as they happened or may well have happened during the reign of Elizabeth I. This film is a superb ensemble presentation; a really good script and acting bringing each character forward, giving the viewer a sympathetic understanding of his or her motives, even if some of those motives are repugnant.

There's another issue lurking in the background, however, and that is the Shake-speare authorship question. If one questions the traditional attribution (the Stratford man) does that mean one wonders ""... how could a commoner have such talent.""? No. The problems with the traditional view have not to do with class, but rather with life experience and education, and with the nurturing of genius.

Mozart wouldn't have been the fully developed genius he was had he not had a father who nurtured and challenged that genius from an early age. In William Shaksper's case, his perfunctory education, his lack of any personal library, or foreign travel, or any correspondence and in fact apparent inability to write don't seem to make him a plausible candidate to be the author.

But the thing can be difficult. From many of the comments one hears a certain apprehension, in most cases followed by the enjoyment of seeing really well done cinema. If you've not seen this film, I would advise you to lay aside authorship questions and just enjoy it. It's the best movie-making I've seen in a long time.",1340928000,3,1552,5.007751937984496
4978373,4,B0068MNNOE,"As a high school English teacher, I love (nearly) all that is Shakespeare and thoroughly love the Renaissance as a whole. When first seeing the trailers for ""Anonymous,"" I was intrigued and excited, though not ever really giving any credence to the idea that William Shakespeare did not actually write the plays we have come to know as his.

I was extremely disappointed in learning of its severely limited release in theaters (the nearest being over eight hours away) and realized that I would have to wait until it made its debut on DVD. It was well worth the wait.

I agree with the reviews that state that the names can be rather challenging to follow, and I expect that I will need to watch it again, to make sure that I caught everything. However, it is worthy of multiple viewings. The acting and costuming are superb.

Though I went into it with the idea that I would dislike the character portrayed as the ""true"" author of all that is recognized as Shakespeare's work, I found myself quite sympathetic toward de Vere. Not only did I feel for this man who could take no credit for his great works, but I found myself truly disliking this ""Will Shakespeare,"" a greedy and opportunistic actor who stumbled into the chance of claiming the works as his own creations.

Now, having said all of that, do I believe that William Shakespeare did not actually write what he is credited with having written? No. This movie, an interesting work of fiction, is simply that. However, for the first time, I truly considered the idea that someone other than William Shakespeare could have written all of these works, and due to his/her station in life, was unable to claim authorship of them. Though I do not believe this to be the case, I would truly sympathize with such a person having to live his/her life watching a lesser ""actor"" claim to be the creator of beloved characters such as Hamlet, Iago (whom I truly love to hate), Benedick & Beatrice, and so many others. It makes for a very interesting what if...

I would highly recommend this film to any who love Shakespeare, the Renaissance, Elizabethan England, or simply have a love of literature. It provides an interesting look at an idea that many of us never bothered to truly consider.",1340928000,5,2240,4.646464646464646

4978376,3,B0068MNNOE,"I picked up ""Anonymous"" as an afterthought, having failed to find any other recent releases that looked appealing. The dvd cover called it a ""cloak-and-dagger"" mystery about the possible identity of William shakespeare, set in ""the political snakepit of Elizabethian England"". I'm not overly interested in Elizabethian England, but I'm willing to give most movies a shot if the jacket has more than one good review on it. Ebert called it ""splendid""; another critic said it "" bursts with energy, wit, and drama"". Were it not for these accolades, I would have overlooked what is probably one of the most interesting movies released last year.

My basic review: A great story, well-written, with top-notch actors, (Vanessa Redgrave is Queen), lush sets and beautiful period costumes.
Warning: if you're looking for entertainment, this is not an easy film. The first time around I drifted off. By the end of the movie I had only a vague idea of what was going on. I had to watch it twice, and really concentrate the second time, to even begin to understand the complex and deeply layered plot.

One of my biggest problems with Royal Court dramas is the use of titles in addition to names; Robert the So-and-So is also the Earl of Such-and Such. There are at least a half a dozen titled major characters to keep track of.
Add to that a complicated, non-chronological timeline that spans more than 40 years. Amidst the action, (and there's plenty), flash-backs and forwards occur frequently and without warning; the viewer has to really focus to keep up. I had a lot of difficulty keeping track of who was who; Is the young Queen the same Queen as the older Queen shown at the beginning of the film, or another Queen altogether? The elderly Earl looks nothing like the younger Earl, but he does look exactly like his son the Earl. (At least I think they're father and son. I'm pretty sure they were the same actor. You'll see what I mean if you watch the movie.)

I have the dvd for 24 hours, so I'm going to watch it again. I don't mind, I enjoy a really demanding film.
If you prefer easier entertainment, and are drawn to Shakespeare and the Royal Court, I'd recommend ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stage-Beauty/dp/B000RHLY7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stage Beauty</a>"", one of my all-time favorite movies. I'm hoping to put ""Anonymous"" on that list, but I'll have to study it a bit more first.
Great watch for the serious film or Shakespeare buff.

Final note: I did watch this a third time, and still find the timeline confusing. I'd hoped the pleasure of watching it would improve with successive viewings, but it stayed about the same. I have to give it 3 stars instead of my original 4. I think this film was a great idea that would have made a much better film had its makers subscribed to the less-is-more school of filmmaking. It might even benefit from some rigorous editing. I still think it's a fascinating story and well worth watching, especially compared to the tons of mediocre, formulaic films you have to dig through to find one as good as this.",1339545600,,3101,4.845283018867924
4978377,4,B0068MNNOE,"Roland Emmerich, best known for directing mostly popcorn munching fare (""Independence Day"", ""2012"", ""10,000 B. C."") goes full costume in this theoretical mystery surrounding the works of William Shakespeare.  For centuries, Shakespeare's numerous plays, poems and sonnets have been probed for authenticity as little, if any, of original Shakespeare's handwritten documents survived.  Writer John Orloff makes a case for the Earl of Oxford being the ghost writer in collusion with Will (Rafe Spall) and Ben Johnson (Sebastian Armesto).

The numerous subplots are often hard to follow what with all the earls, dukes, kings and queens all involved in subterfuge to name the heir to Queen Elizabeth I (Vanessa Redgrave).  Oxford (nicely played by Rhys Ifans) has a burning desire to write and write he does.  Because of his nobility however, publishing would be unheard of.  Writing was perceived by the religious right as blasphemous although that was not the Queen's belief.  In any case writing would be beneath the stature of the Earl.

Integrated into the story are numerous bastard children including those born of the Queen herself.  Admittedly I'm a sucker for these British royal dramas and this one was no different, well, except that I didn't buy much of the Shakespeare theory being offered.  Still, the costumes are wonderful, the acting is first rate and the story is fun if unlikely.  But who knows?",1338940800,2,1410,5.1946902654867255

4978390,3,B0068MNNOE,"Watching Roland Emmerich's Anonymous made me realize what ridiculous lengths you have to go to when you cite other,usually more noble men, to be the true authors of Shakespeare's plays. Here Gloriana,the Virgin Queen, changes into a whore and hussy,having illegitimate children all over the place. The Earl of Oxford becomes her son and lover,while really being the supposed author of the works of `Shakespeare',who here is depicted as an illiterate buffoon,who can't even sign his name. The Earl of Southampton becomes De Vere's son. Ben Jonson becomes the messenger of the works from De Vere's pen,slagging off Shakespeare as a fraud,unable to get his own works put on. Marlowe gets killed by Shakespeare. Behind it all is the snobbish idea that only an aristocratic education could produce Shakespeare's range of reference(Oxford's study heaves with books, astrolabes, stuffed exotica).This is not just a what if fantasy,but a propaganda campaign to unseat the bard,with the backing of actors like Jacobi,Rylance,Redgave,Richardson,all publically casting doubt on Shakespeare's authorship. Emmerich poses a conspiracy in the film not to reveal the true author,a world of surveillance and torture. There's not a shred of documentary evidence connects De Vere to the plays and he died in 1604 before 10 of the Jacobean plays were written. German director,American scriptwriter, flippantly rewrite the English past. A 9 year old De Vere writes and acts in A Midsummer Night's Dream before the young queen. We see various stagings of the plays(under the aloof,discrete eye of De Vere,the magisterial Rhys Ifans)viewed through the narrow prism of Elizabethan court politics-so screenwriter Orloff suggests that Hamlet parodies Lord Burleigh,the queen's aged counsellor, while Richard III portrays his hunchbacked son Robert Cecil.

If you realise the film is a theory not based on fact then like Shakespeare in Love you can enjoy with the aid of CGI,the stunning capture of the architectural details,the mud-splatttered streets of London,seeping with sewage,this is a meticulously-crafted,well-acted film. We get lush interior court scenes or candle-lit chambers, the swarming of groundlings in a brilliantly-realised Globe theatre or around the bear pit. Ifans portays De Vere's understated,melancholy gracefulness, ""An actor!"" he laments. ""An actor, for God's sake!"" But Shakespeare it is, and Oxford continues to launder his material through this semi-literate idiot. This film is based upon a class-obsessed,anti-democratic agenda,looking back to feudalism rather than forward to modernity,based upon Looney's counterfactual bible,for true believers,rather than believers in truth. Yet a good film. Rylance turns in a radiant performance as an actor at the Globe,Armesto is excellent as Ben Jonson,Redgrave plays Elizabeth in her dotage and Hogg is brilliant as Robert Cecil. It's fitting that De Vere is plagued by voices he writes into the plays. Some of the chronology gets lost as the film jumps in the darkly lit scenes. Ben Jonson,now there's a subject,life and works,for film treatment!",1337385600,4,3095,5.585106382978723
4978391,5,B0068MNNOE,"This inevitable feature film is based on a longtime claim held by a tiny minority of Shakespeare enthusiasts that Shakespeare himself could not possibly have written his plays, since their enormous vocabulary and mastery of the language was simply beyond the capabilities of a man of humble birth to an illiterate commoner from the countryside and who may or may not have received even a rudimentary grammar school education (a 1989 Frontline documentary, ""The Shakespeare Mystery,"" has previously covered the issue). The most plausible candidate who might have written the plays but for political reasons had to keep his identity secret is Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford (the Christopher Marlowe claim deserves separate treatment).

The voices of the Oxford supporters or ""Oxfordians"" have grown more clamorous over the years, and the maxim that something repeated loud and long enough becomes the truth seems to be working in their favor. But in fact this supposedly solid argument of theirs is actually their weakest. No matter how elaborate an education you have received, you cannot write effective plays (poetry, maybe) if you are an earl, a duke, a nobleman or aristocrat lolling around in luxury and cut off from the rest of society. All the great playwrights of any country or era became playwrights because they were extensively involved in the life of the theater. The daily grind of memorizing hundreds and hundreds of lines in concurrently running plays and spending half of the day moving around the stage in rehearsals and performance before thousands of spectators would effect a unique and extraordinary mental transformation, whereby all this language would combine and recombine into one's own, enabling the more linguistically gifted of these actors to write plays even superior to those they were already performing. ONLY a dramatist and actor in the intense hothouse environment of the Elizabethan theater could have written these plays. The Oxfordians also have to contend with other inconvenient evidence documenting Shakespeare's life, which they must suppress in order to spin a coherent counter-narrative (e.g., the references in Shakespeare's plays to flora and fauna species only existing in his West Country rural vicinity).

That said, this is an extremely important movie. It's beautifully acted and filmed, with exquisite attention to period details and setting, including the most convincing and sustained mockups yet of the Globe and other theaters in which the plays were performed; there is even a scene in a bear-baiting arena (see my ""A Shakespeare sex-and-violence starter kit"" on my website linked to my Amazon profile page for more on the Bankside environs).

Both films present snippets of performances from the plays - ""Romeo and Juliet"" in the earlier film; ""Hamlet,"" ""Henry V"", etc., in the current film - that, though all too brief, are as gripping as any of the greatest cinematic performances of the plays.

Shakespeare lovers and scholars who are heaping invective on ""Anonymous"" as an outrage and who fear the film could have a negative impact on the younger generation by trivializing and distorting the facts about Shakespeare are missing the point. This film slices open the bloated underbelly of stodgy Shakespeare scholarship and dreary high school pedagogy, creating a lively debate where there was none before, educating and piquing a huge new audience about the historical context of Shakespeare. The creative retelling of the circle of intrigue around Elizabeth, the Cecils, Essex, Southampton, and Oxford throws fresh light as well on this history and the very writing of this history, despite the fictionalized liberties it takes (which ""Shakespeare in Love"" is also guilty of). On the contrary, this film could revolutionize the teaching of Shakespeare in schools by forcing debate and putting teachers' and professors' knowledge of the known facts on the stand, which have been too long taken for granted.",1337126400,,5346,6.34065934065934
4978392,3,B0068MNNOE,"Anonymous had the potential to win over many people as the first major mainstream expose of the Shakespeare authorship debate. Whilst an interesting film in terms of its underlying concept, I spent the first half hour of the movie trying to work out who was who and what was going on. It was only when the issues of Shakespeare being a front for the Earl of Oxford came to the fore that my attention was hooked - although the depiction of Shakespeare as a buffoon was way off the historical mark - a country bumpkin perhaps but he was actually very shrewd - just look at his business activities and money lending activities (little known facts about Shakespeare I know - but my blog explores this more).

Overall once the film settled down it was good - but was a little confusing about what it actually was - was it a political thriller or an expose about Shakespeare being a fraud. This does not seek in any way to take away from great acting, great historical sets and the attention to detail by the director (to the point of ink on the fingers).

First, the film. Is there a more sumptuous and accurate visual depiction of the Elizabethan Age somewhere else in cinema-land? Pray tell, as I've not seen it. The care for detail and feel from the art directors and costumers here is lush and stunning. That alone makes this worth watching for fans of the period.

Likewise the language; Orloff turns many a phrase with great aplomb, and his words flow beside the words of The Bard quite well: no mean feat indeed. Rhys Ifans is extraordinary, though the main fault in his performance lies in the script--more humor is needed! WS was one very very funny guy, and that's missing here. But this is played more as Greek tragedy than bawdy Chaucerian comedy, so it's understandable.

The direction is excellent, with non-stop mind-boggling detail from both the sights and sounds, never a dull moment for any intelligent mind, and I was amazed that Emmerich could have this much feel for historical drama after seeing some of his bombastic popcorn flicks. But good on him for taking this much time and effort to produce a real piece of eye candy for period film fans. And his brilliant idea to make this a play within a play within a film dovetails perfectly with WS's own frequent dissections of the layers of reality within the artifice of theater.

The plotting is fascinating, presenting a wild yet mostly plausible historical scenario despite various inaccuracies (this is historical fiction, after all), which brings us to the whole did he or didn't he aspect. In short, this film is for those who love WS's work above all, and are not blindly obsessed with who wrote it.

Let's be honest: whatever the name of the writer or writers of Shakespeare's frighteningly brilliant canon, the real author is The Muse, or God or whatever you call that spirit that lifts artists into the realm of deep truth. That WS was so possessed so often is the real mystery, whoever he or even they might have been.

I find it rather funny and not a little ironic to see how painfully anal some ""scholars"" can be on this issue (you know, those folks who can't write well enough to live from it, so they have to write about those who could. In other words, a large chunk of Academia. Ouch! If that stung you, imagine what Shakespeare would say about your hero worship...). And miss the forest for the trees much? The real author was clearly brilliant enough to enjoy the mystery, and probably even stoked those fires on purpose out of a sheer love of mankind's endless stupidity. Who invented fire? Does it matter? What counts is that it warms our hearth and cooks our food and lights our way.

And so with the works of Shakespeare (but best to burn the collected volumes for maximum warmth). One fact most anti-Oxfordians conveniently ignore is that the children of the actor William Shakespeare could not even write their names; they all signed their papers with an X. That's how the finest writer of perhaps all time educated his kids? Sure it is.
And how could a man who'd barely traveled and who didn't speak Greek or Latin or Italian know so much about those tongues or histories or lands?

But once again, the main thing is the words he/she/it wrote. And those words are and will forever be truly golden, as the scenes here make so clear. His words ring so true in context of all the drama here, and the Babelsberg extras in the Globe scenes seem truly transfixed by them. Imagine seeing the first production of Hamlet!! The mind fairly reels.

And that's what I loved most about this film: the filmmakers' sheer love of the work itself shines through (like me, they seem more amazed by the thoughts than obsessed with who wrote them). And a true bonus here is the commentary by Emmerich and Orloff, one of the best, most revealing and detailed commentaries I've ever heard. I was even more impressed upon finding out how they'd made this, and how incredibly skilfully the green screen was used. I watched it on dvd, but I'll be getting the blu-ray to really appreciate the wondrous costumes and sets. I almost never do that, but this is a film worth watching many times just to take in the many many details.

The director and writer also make some very convincing points for the Oxford argument, but if you're one of those folks for whom the pedantry of endless authorship arguments is more vital than the sheer beauty and scope of the Bard's wisdom, then I can only say, good luck with that.

Those who understand that Shakespeare is just a name attached to some of the finest thoughts ever written down by any human will continue to focus on what matters: the wit and wisdom of the work itself. The rest is merely smoke and mirrors. It's the truth within the words that makes the Shakespearean canon literally beyond belief, and Anonymous does those words justice in many ways.

Mark Twain and George Bernard Shaw were self-made authors obsessed with that question. Twain even wrote a book about it, ""Is Shakespeare Dead???"" in 1905. His money was on Bacon. But his book raises all the questions that need to be answered.

German director Roland Emmerich has put together a terrific movie that points to de Vere as ""the soul of the age"".

It is a parlor game with no real solution. Seems that someone in Shakespeare's time made certain to wipe the slate clean of all but a few scraps of evidence. All arguments are two surmises removed from pure guessing.

If Malcolm Gladwell is correct that geniuses must put in 10,000 hours of sweat to master the craft, it is difficult to make a case for either man. Where are the early plays too awful to produce?

The actors are convincing; the computer-generated landscape seems quite real.  It was hard seeing William Shakespeare turned into an immoral, possibly murderous, boob, but it IS within the realm of possibility.  Still, that could have been toned down.

4978425,2,B0068MNNOE,"If you've ever seen Shakespeare performed poorly, you know what 'Anonymous' is like - dense, confused, and wandering.

There's promise here, with the always-impressive Derek Jacobi setting the stage for a tale of conspiracy and intrigue in the tale of the origin of Shakespeare's plays. But like those plays, how it's presented is everything.

What follows is thick with vague politics and complex relationships in a story that leaps back and forth along multiple generations. Dense with exposition and light on elegance, 'Anonymous' tries to make the case for the possible origins of Shakespeare's work by bludgeoning you to death with its richly-portrayed sets and its historical figure name-dropping. It fails to make the case, but worse, it fails the source material.

The works of Shakespeare here are presented tepidly, the scenes shown are the obvious ones (St. Crispian's from 'Henry V' and To Be or Not To Be from 'Hamlet', among others), when lesser-known scenes would have conveyed the idea better. The performances are weak when they needed to be powerful, too serious when they could have been pointedly witty.

Like papier-mache, layer after layer is applied, in the hopes that you'll miss the fact that it doesn't really go together. What's left is a confused, drippy mess that neither captivates nor titillates, and does its source material a disservice.

The mystery of who William Shakespeare was and how he wrote so elegantly and inspiringly may never be solved - but it certainly won't be solved by this ham-handed mess of a film.

4978442,3,B0068MNNOE,"This film has Elizabethan and Shakespearian scholars alike up in arms, because it suggests that the great, learned man known as William Shakespeare may not have written his own plays. I am a scholar of Elizabeth, and I saw it with a scholar of Shakespeare. Both of us were offended... and both of us were impressed.

Poet Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armesto) has been dragged into the Tower of London for concealing the politically motivated plays of the late, lamented William Shakespeare. His belief that they have burn down with the Globe Theater sends the audience into earlier times, and the artistic merits of the Earl of Oxford (Rhys Ifans). A man of title but no longer a fortune thanks to his debts and his insistence upon writing, he searches for a name to put with his voice. Ben seems the ideal choice, a poet of little regard and no actual voice, a playwright whose works are of little account. But he is offended at the notion of putting his name to another man's plays and passes the manuscript along to William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall), an actor who snatches up the opportunity to become famous. His plays swiftly come to the attention of the aging Elizabeth Tudor (Vanessa Redgrave), who recalls a much earlier time when she was similarly impressed by the Earl's works.

Their romance (Joely Richardson, Jamie Campbell Bower) plays out against the political scheming of her advisors, among whom is the hunchbacked Robert Cecil (Edward Hogg). Much later, the Earl of Oxford intends to influence the decision of the queen as to which of her heirs will inherit the throne -- and the play Richard III will incite the peasants against her trusted advisor. What results is a clever blending of actual events and fictitious conclusions. Some of them, like the curiosity surrounding how a man of little learned means could have written such magnificent plays, are valid questions. Others, like the fact that Elizabeth had numerous illegitimate children, stretch the imagination a bit. But as far as rearranging history goes, it is exceptionally well done and will make you wonder at the end if any of it is possible. My friend began with the assurance that Shakespeare wrote his own plays and concluded wondering if her initial theory is in fact the truth. In that regard, the film is a masterpiece of manipulation, lent an air of seriousness through the early narration of renowned Shakespearian performer Derek Jacobi. But when it comes right down to it, some of the conclusions it draws are far too unbelievable and do no service to my favorite historical monarch.

Many have complained that this film is difficult to follow, since it jumps back and forth between three different timelines -- the semi-modern story surrounding the arrest of the poet concealing the literary masterpieces, earlier in his own life as the Earl found a voice for his plays, and as a young man when he was romantically linked to Elizabeth. It does require the audience pay attention but I had little trouble keeping up with events. In all regards, it is an accomplishment of costuming and actor choices. Everyone is magnificent in their respective roles and the dialogue flows with ease. I am curious, however, as to why so much of the score was slight revision on Elizabeth's score.

A decent way to reference this film would be ""intriguing."" It leaps to wild conclusions but carries the audience along for the ride. It has a leading man who is unlikable yet we are too fascinated to abandon him entirely. I'm honestly torn in my opinion of it because on one hand, it makes a startling argument and blends history so well that it left even me questioning the motivations behind certain events. But on the other, I hate revisionist history and that is what it is actively engaged in doing, smearing the reputation of Elizabeth I along the way. But as much as it started steam rising over my head, it also entertained me. So what am I left with? Mixed feelings.",1332374400,43,3944,4.795588235294118
4978443,2,B0068MNNOE,"This movie isn't remotely accurate. But that's ok. It clearly isn't trying to be. Where it does fall down is that it isn't even believable. Nor is it thrilling. It's plodding and dull. I went in hoping that it would either be ridiculously bad or decently good, but it falls somewhere in the middle which makes it surprisingly unmemorable. It is however, at least original.

What's quietly infuriating about this movie is Roland Emmerich's apparent desire to tear down the English. Shakespeare is a buffoon. That's to be expected from the very premise. But did they have to make Elizabeth an incompetent too? As a young woman she acts like a horny high schooler. She sleeps with everyone and has had several bastards which somehow nobody noticed despite her highly public position. She displays no evidence of nobility and simply acts like one of the girls. She is also under the control of William Cecil, the arch-villian of the piece. As an old woman she fares no better, suffering from dementia or at least deteriorating mentally. And do we really need tales of incest as well? At no point does she display any trace of class. In fact, the only character who does display this is De Vere, and he's the one that everyone keeps berating for not following his (ill-defined) role as a nobleman. The Cecils do display a bit of this, but they're so cartoonishly evil that it never really sticks. Between this, the scene of the British burning villagers to death in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Patriot/dp/B000O19EW0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Patriot</a>, and the unnecessary scene of Queen Elizabeth II walking her dogs onto the escape ship in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2012/dp/B0035G0U2O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2012</a>&nbsp;I'm detecting a real pattern here.

Emmerich really doesn't get Shakespeare at all. Everything that Shakespeare wrote served one fixed political purpose? It doesn't take a literary critic to see that that makes no sense. His use of the plays for political ends displays only the most superficial examples. For example, Polonius from Hamlet is dressed like William Cecil. Therefore his getting stabbed is a strike against Cecil. My only question is this: How? How does dressing a character up as a political figure count as making a political point? Polonius wasn't one of Shakespeare's arch-villains (Robert Cecil gets a much better one in Richard III), he was just a somewhat crafty man assisting the king. So what was the implication of it? There's nothing damaging to Cecil's reputation there, and the only reason that there is any connection made is because of the costuming. Which isn't anything to do with the written play at all. He could have dressed anyone up as Cecil and it would have had the same effect is what I gather. So that means the choice of ""Shakespeare's"" plays is unnecessary. They could have used anyone. And watching a play wherein the villain looks like a famous figure is reliably going to provoke a riot calling for his overthrow? Really? How dumb does he think people are? If somebody digitally placed Obama's head on Hitler's body could we expect the same reaction here?

A really confusing aspect of this film is its tendency to switch between modern and Elizabethan English at the drop of a hat and for no reason. It's like they remember to match the tone of the plays only occasionally and then ad lib the rest. Another confusing feature is how they keep switching back and forth in time. The only way to keep track is to spot the younger actors playing the part. Not always easy to tell in all those elaborate costumes.

So the good points: Rhys Ifans is excellent as Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford. He's pretty much the only character who manages to be interesting and sympathetic. While they never give him any motivation or insight (being a genius is considered enough of an explanation apparently) he does at least come off well. Also coming off pretty well (or at least entertaining) is Rafe Spall as Shakespeare. He's a pathetic, greedy little man and it is immensely fun. Apart from them and a brief introduction by Derek Jacobi (performing the same role he did better in Henry V) the acting in this film is uniformly horrible. The look of the city is superb and manages to capture a good deal of the griminess that most films manage to leave out while still maintaining a sense of scale. It was very nice to see London Bridge rendered in beautiful CGI. Also, some of the staging (although stolen from better films) wasn't too bad. But apart from these fairly minor points the movie has nothing to offer. You're better off seeing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shakespeare-in-Love/dp/B00001U0E1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shakespeare in Love</a>&nbsp;or one of the many films based off his plays. This one offers a fresh idea, but cannot decide whether it is a realistic drama or an over-the-top spectacle. Either one would be fine, but this film never commits.",1332288000,6,5076,5.171532846715328
4978444,4,B0068MNNOE,"It's amazing the stories that come up and even more so to think that they are all completely original. Some say there are truly only several different stories available to tell but that these 3-4 are embellished enough to make them different. Then there are the classics, the tales told for what seems like forever. Take for instance Shakespeare. His plays and sonnets are considered the best ever written in the English language. But what if he wasn't the actual author?

There are historical discussions on just this topic and that's where the inspiration for the movie ANONYMOUS comes from. It takes the idea that Shakespeare was actually illiterate and that someone else wrote everything he is credited with.

Edward De Vere, the Earl of Oxford (Rhys Ifans) is an aristocrat dedicated to his queen, Elizabeth I (Vanessa Redgrave). But he sees those around her manipulating things to the way they wish them to be as opposed to what is best for England. It seems that the Queen takes the word and influence of William Cecil (David Thewliss) more than that of anyone and past history has yielded De Vere and Cecil as mortal enemies even though De Vere is married to Cecil's daughter.

De Vere is a man of words as well as action. It is through these words that he has always reached the Queen. The movie moves forward and back in time showing them as subject and royalty and also as lovers. But there are dark secrets looming which aren't revealed until much later. The movie is filled with secrets and plotting turning what would at first seem the tale of Shakespeare into a political thriller instead.

Watching the lowly crowds during performances of plays De Vere realizes the power one could have by controlling this crowd. They react to the words being performed but none is enough to spark them or inspire them. He has those words and the ability to write them but his position prevents him from doing so. Instead he hires playwright Ben Johnson (Sebastian Armento) to produce the plays he writes using his name instead. Johnson backs out on the deal though, releasing the play as written by Anonymous. When the crowd calls for the author actor William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall), who knows of the deal, steps forward to take credit where it isn't due.

The plays continue to be written and performed and the crowd can't get enough. And in various stories they can see that they relate to things happening in England, slightly camouflaged but not quite enough to hide their true meaning. At the same time the members of the Queen's court are made aware as well and manipulations are implemented to sway her majesty. The center of their disagreement lies in an heir to the throne. Elizabeth has no legitimate children to inherit the crown and Cecil wants to insert James, the son of Mary and a Scot. Those who believe that only a true Englishman should rule are seeking someone else.

The behind the scenes wheeling and dealing, the deceptions that come into play and the final twist in this story make for an interesting film. With so many characters with so many titles, it becomes slightly confusing at times but not enough to take away from the story going on. Instead it's like watching one of the classic BBC series that used the same subject matter just turning it into a 2 hour film rather than a month long series.

The acting is amazing. As always to me the sign of a fantastic actor is one who so immerses himself in the role that you never even consider that someone is acting but accept them as that person. Ifans does an amazing job setting so into the role that you would barely recognize him from previous films. The supporting cast does an extremely great job as well and casting Joely Richardson to play the young Queen while her mother portrays the aging Queen was a smart move.

The film may not be for everyone. It offers little to no action or true comedy. Instead it tells a possibility that may have existed in history, the true author of the plays of Shakespeare and their real reason for being written. It offers intrigue to the fullest extent making current spy movies seem rather cumbersome and this one more filled with finesse. It's an interesting movie that will entertain you if you give it a chance and perhaps influence you to look deeper. The question of who actually wrote the plays is still in doubt and argued by scholars around the world. Watching a movie like this could inspire you to look deeper into finding an answer.",1332201600,5,4466,4.651457541191381

Rather than comment on the merits of the movie, which others have done so well, I want to comment on why this controversy is so interesting and, well . . . so controversial.

The subject is interesting because it combines history, literature and psychology with a touch of mystery. It combines historical study of the dynamic Elizabethan period with study of the foremost literature in the English language with a mix of biographical psychology. No wonder psychologists like Freud and modern actors and attorneys are drawn to research the authorship question.

The subject is controversial because it challenges an orthodox perspective that is supported by academia, tourism, the stage and the publishing industry and threatens a paradigm change that could literally upset the apple cart for a lot of people whose careers depend on the Stratford scenario.

4978463,5,B0068MNNOE,"About 300 years after the publication of the first collected works of Shakespeare, the so-called First Folio (1623), a schoolmaster named J. Thomas Looney (pronounced ""loanee"") facilitated his students in readings of the Shakespeare plays, particularly ""the Merchant of Venice"". Over the years while watching the plays, hearing their rhetoric, and absorbing this remarkable voice whose Elizabethan presence is still revered and studied today, Looney became convinced the man from Stratford who is attributed to having written the plays (the Orthodox View), was not the true author. He came to believe the name ""William Shakespeare"" which appeared on two published poems, the later quartos and the First Folio was in reality a pseudonym for someone else, possibly a nobleman. Previously, those who questioned the Orthodox View, sometimes called Anti-Stratfordians, had proposed others of the Elizebethan Age, such as Sir Francis Bacon and Christopher Marlowe, but Looney was convinced the true author was someone never before put forth since Shakespearian scholarship began in the 18th century. Shakespeare has and still does remain shrouded in mystery.

Because Shakespeare biographical detail has been sketchy at best, Looney developed a profile similar to those used by detectives to paint a picture of his candidate, based on elements in the plays. He determined the writer was a nobleman, a Falconer, possibly sympathetic to the Lancastrian side of the Wars of the Roses, and someone who loved Italy and Italian culture. And, most important of all, that he was a poet who possibly had written poems and/or plays under his own name before going under the name of William Shakespeare. After finding a number of primary sources at the British Library, he came up with his findings. Looney proposed a somewhat forgotten nobleman named Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, as being the true identity of the poet/playwright William Shakespeare in a book called simply ""Shakespeare Identified"".

""Anonymous"" is a film based on Looney's original notion that Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, penned the plays which would become the greatest literary canon of the English language. The events surrounding the plays, their performances, Oxford's conscious willingness to stay behind the scenes, and the attribution of the plays to the man from Stratford, a businessman who had little or no experience in theatre, are all dramatized in a period film which takes you back to the world of the Elizabethan Stage. One of the best aspects of ""Anonymous"" is how it relates the plays to political rhetoric of the period. In recent years, Shakespearian scholars have proposed that many figures of the Elizabethan Court were satirized in the plays, such as William Cecil and his son Robert Cecil. The links between the plays and contemporary politics are brought to the fore much more directly than in ""Shakespeare in Love"".

Character actor Rhys Ifans offers an Oscar-caliber performance as the man who some believe was the real Shakespeare. Ifans finds that delicate balance between the remarkable artist and the troubled nobleman who could not reconcile the two worlds of his life. If Shakespeare was in fact a nobleman who went under a pseudonym, many of the events portrayed in ""Anonymous"" are plausible. Unlike today, playwrights and poets lived on the periphery of society, and a nobleman of the rank of Oxford writing plays containing charged political rhetoric would have been scandalous, hence the Shakespeare-Oxford theory.

The hero of the movie is actually his colleague Ben Johnson, the Elizabethan playwright who has always dwelt under the shadow of Shakespeare, especially in modern times. Johnson would have been the greatest playwright of his age if Shakespeare had not been writing. In this story, he becomes the guardian of the Shakespeare plays, and supposedly the man who saves the canon for posterity. Johnson in fact wrote the preface to the First Folio of 1623. If there had been a cover-up of Shakespeare's true identity, Johnson would have known.

While the film bases many of its embellishments on facts known about Edward de Vere, the film does take a few rather implausible historical licenses, not unlike Amadeus which appeared about 25 years ago. Edward de Vere may have flirted with Queen Elizabeth when he was younger, but whether they bore a child does seem quite fantastic. Later in the film, an extraordinary truth about Oxford's own heritage is revealed. However, films have to tell a story, and some licenses are made in order the story remain interesting and compelling. Shakespeare in many of his plays bent history to fulfill his dramatic goals and theatrical visions.

Many Shakespeare enthusiasts not only dismiss the Oxfordian argument but do not approve of the subject altogether. Some Stratfordians' view is that there is no ""authorship question"" and that any attempt to discredit the man from Stratford does a disservice to Shakespare. I think ""Anonymous"" is not so much about changing minds but about bringing the question out into the open. Regardless on which side of the fence you may be, there are a lot of questions concerning the life of Shakespeare. Answers to mundane questions, such as primary sources concerning his composing, are strangely absent. No one seems to have mentioned Stratford being any kind of a poet, playwright or actor in Stratford. However, as shown in the film, primary source evidence survives which speaks of Edward de Vere as an adolescent putting on a short play for the young Queen Elizabeth.

So the film brings us back to the fundamental question: did Oxford write the Shakespeare Canon or was it the man from Stratford? Primary source evidence is sparse, and documents which could have shed light on this problem may have perished in the Great Fire of London in 1666. In short, we may never know. But Oxford's star is on the rise, and in years to come, this may be the first film to acknowledge there is indeed a question. Whether it has been answered is up to each viewer.",1331251200,12,6054,5.1029263370333

4978469,3,B0068MNNOE,"As someone fascinated by the Authorship Question, I was really looking forward to this movie. And while it is well-done, it lacks the coherency and definitive persuasiveness one would hope such a film possessed.

What this movie deserves praise for is its superb acting, especially by Joely Richardson and Vanessa Redgrave, expanse art direction, well-crafted script, fantastic sets that transform the audience into Elizabethan London, and plenty of action and intrigue.

The film starts, surprisingly, in modern-day New York City, with a narrator leading us to question Who Was Really Shakespeare? It loses some of that tremendous creative goodwill, by tackling the Prince of Tudor subplot, which states that Shakespeare was Queen Elizabeth I's son (and, later, her lover, although she was unaware of the fact that their relationship was incestuous) -- the movie this loses credibility. It's almost as if Emmerich is too afraid to profess his belief that Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford was Shakespeare, and must masquerade such belief behind an elaborate plot that will be liked by the Hollywood masses expecting a good, entertaining story and nothing more.",1330387200,2,1167,5.302702702702702

4978492,3,B0068MNNOE,"What we have here, in this movie, is a dramatization of an argument.  This has produced many entertaining and well-reasoned reviews and posts, seemingly because the movie itself is a diatribe, and arguments beget arguments.

Still, when you look at a movie, you have to ask whether it succeeds at more than merely being provocative.  In this case, I would say no, not really.  'Anonymous' is off-putting.  Just out of the gates, in the beginning segment, the beguiling Mr. DeVere announces that ""all art is political...""  Well, that is a very postmodern statement from an Elizabethan personage, parroting the common modern 'wisdom' that history is but an agreed-upon set of lies.

It also seems a bit disingenuous to present a 'hot' controversy that in fact has been debated for centuries.  And this movie nearly succeeds in creating a reductio ad absurdum.  Marlowe, Jonson and other playwrights of the period are depicted as semi-competent and glib, sort of like a fraternity of precocious underclassmen.  And then the dubious 'true author' is presented as a shadowy, Phantom-of-the-Opera figure--an isolated, bitter genius, who is quite professorial in his outlook, and sports a desk and study bedecked with cliches.

This also feeds into a current love of conspiracy theories in the movie-going public, which has been treated to ""Amadeus"", and ""The DaVinci Code"".  Are these speculations really brave, or are they manipulative?  They certainly are moneymaking.

In the end, the argument seems to hinge on whether a lowly actor could indeed possess the imagination and knowledge to have produced these masterpieces.  Actors are cattle, right?  But doesn't an actor succeed on innate understanding of human nature?  That is a question this movie doesn't answer, because Shakespeare had perhaps the best understanding of human nature ever known to mankind.  One would think he would also have been a terrifically social individual, and not really a reclusive man who hid in darkness.

It reminds me of one of my favorite song lyrics.  ""All in all, it's all the same--but, call me if there's any change"" , from a baroque-rock upstart named Keith Reid.  It doesn't matter.  It will never be resolved.  Maybe Shakespeare could have been--an alien?  We'll just never know, will we?",1330041600,3,2278,5.144414168937329

Shakespeare is certainly one of my greatest literary heroes, and any slight against him (especially when said slight was a claim of complete illegitimacy) was not to be well-received by me.

This movie is well-written, well-paced, true to the feel of the Shakespearean verse and, perhaps most importantly, very enjoyable to watch.  If you are curious about whether or you would have any interest in this movie, I can strongly recommend it to you.  It may be a bit long, but it never feels slow.  If, however you are like I was, and you are avoiding this movie on account of its premise, I urge you to reconsider.

4978494,5,B0068MNNOE,"`All art is political, otherwise it would just be decoration.' ANONYMOUS is first and foremost a beautifully crafted film  - script, direction, lighting, costume, music, cinematography, acting - and whether or not the viewer buys into the premise that the plays and sonnets of Shakespeare were the work of Edward de Vere instead of the apparently illiterate actor 'William Shakspar' is unimportant.  Controversy abounds in every field of study - politics, religion, science, poetry, the origin of man, etc - so the veracity of the film's take on history is not the issue.  The film so beautifully brings to life the period of Queen Elizabeth and the flavor of those times and so richly floods the screen with delicious dialogue and comedy and human frailty that it is immensely successful. Roland Emmerich directs with a firm grasp on Elizabethan ambience and John Orloff's screenplay is wholly convincing.

The film's beginning - after Derek Jacobi introduces the concept of the possible misconception of the true William Shakespeare's identity to a contemporary audience, underlining the fact that Shakespeare is as alive today as when the following story begins - is a bit difficult to follow as the timeframes change back and forth throughout the film to make the story plausible. The young Queen Elizabeth (Joely Richardson, daughter of Vanessa Redgrave who plays the aged Elizabeth later) is a flirt and has affairs, one with the young Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford (Jamie Campbell Bower), becomes pregnant, and gives birth to a son whom the Earl is banned from ever seeing or knowing.  Years later their son is the Earl of Southhampton (Xavier Samuel). Edward de Vere as the older Earl of Oxford (Rhys Ifans in a brilliant performance) who rather than tend to wealth prefers to write plays, works that he passes on to Ben Jonson (Samuel Armesto) in whose theater the plays are performed by an `anonymous' playwright.  The plays have become the favorite entertainment of the aged Elizabeth I (now Vanessa Redgrave) and De Vere soon feels the need to protect his privacy and asks Jonson to accept credit for writing the plays, but Jonson in turn passes that authorship to an illiterate actor named William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall) who uses the lie to increase his popularity and wealth.

Coloring the atmosphere is the palace intrigue of who will be Elizabeth's heir - and the Cecils (David Thewlis father and Edward Hogg son) decide it must be James of Scotland (not a choice Elizabeth would make).  But since only Elizabeth and de Vere know who the blood heir is the intrigue passes into near warfare with the Essex rebellion against the Queen.

Many of the known characters of the period are included  - Christopher Marlowe (Trystan Gravelle), the Earl of Essex (Sam Reid) - making the notion of keeping tack of all the derring-do of the court a bit tedious at times.  But there are so very many moments of memorable beauty in this film that the occasional befuddlement of who is who and what is what simply doesn't matter.  Whether the viewer buys into the identity of William Shakespeare as history has described him or to this far more credible story of the man responsible for writing the greatest plays the world has ever known is inconsequential. Settle back for a glorious cinematic achievement brimming over with Elizabethan color and intrigue and frivolity. One of the finest pictures of the year.

I was kind of partial to Jonson, Marlowe or Bacon (they collaborated - it was a conspiracy), haha.

Also, not one document/manuscript has been found written in W.S. hand. W.S. had only a grammar school education (equivalent middle school but more rigorous, admittedly); he, his wife and his daughters were probably somewhat illiterate as they all signed documents with a X at times; in his will all he leaves his wife his second best bed and made no mention of books or manuscripts. Analysis of de Vere's Bible shows underlined/marked passages critical to W.S. writings. Then there's word selection and frequency analysis which suggests authorship as not W.S. Yet, there are good arguments to be made that W.S. was the author and the most interesting of which are the errors in his writings which would have more likely come from a less literate person. Was there any reason for deception? Well, there is some reason to believe that stage writing was beneath a nobleman so anonymity was desirable.

besides Shakespeare wrote his works. In fact it tries perhaps just a little too hard. Yes the story is presented reasonbly well, all the actors do a fine job but
there are problems. The movie makes many inferences that it would be nice to be able to see a little more proof to back them up. Warning Spoilers ahead! First that the queen had a number of children out of wedlock. That Two of the earls were among them, that she had a relationship with at least two of them unknowingly commiting incest with them. That Shakespeare was actually some sort of special illiterate who took advantage of the earls need of silence and to remain anonymous since if the queen and the court knew that he was the author could have sent him to the tower or at least could have cost him his position at court. There are a number of other inferences in the film, but I will not discuss them here. Though it is interesting that there are no available examples of Shakespeare's or the Earl's works. I found it interesting that the film makers mixed a fair amount of the historical truth in the story. Such as the burning of the Globe Theater, The events surrounding Exxex,
the death of the queen, and death of Christopher Marlow. No I don't believe that Shakespear killed him, but he did die mysteriously. The film is a good effort to tell an interesting story.

I don't often pause a movie, but I had no problem doing so during this one.  There were plenty of ""dramatic pauses"" during which to do so.

The movie is full of political supposition and apparently the writer loved the idea of Elizabeth I having multiple bastard children.  The life of William Shakespeare, as the summary suggested this film to be about, could be condensed into about 45 minutes of this over 2 hour tale.  I feel I am being generous suggesting his life got that much screen time. Even the plays are allotted minimal time.

""William Shakespeare"" is a con-man of a con-man (Johnson), paid by a con-man of sorts; he being the noble artist himself.  William is a drunken, rather stupid and greedy actor, Johnson a blundering coward and our noble writer seems to want to back a successor to Elizabeth I but we are never really told his motives (other than the obvious distrust of James of Scotland).

If you enjoy seeing Elizabeth I portrayed as less than the strong, independent, fierce Tudor queen she was known to be, watch Anonymous.

4978521,2,B0068MNNOE,"This review is on the movie itself and contains spoilers:

I recently watched the film and tried to judge it on its own merits and not on what I've read about Elizabethan history and it has to be one of the more unintentionally funny movies of the past year. Rafe Spall was great as this buffoonish Shakespeare. There should have been more of him for intended laughs but he provided plenty of unintended laughs as well.

**The guy is depicted as this vain actor that we never see on stage. Exactly what was his position in the theater company prior to ""becoming a writer"" is never clear. The fact that he is such an idiot but apparently is listened to by those who run a business venture.

**Shakespeare is depicted as being so full of himself that he's a sniveling twit but yet he apparently can kill Marlowe without any thought. He's an idiot but yet he's dangerous. You can do that but you have to SHOW the dangerous side at some point.

**Again Shakespeare, the low life, is apparently able to blackmail an earl who lives in London and is probably active in the court. Why wouldn't De Vere just have him killed or imprisoned on some trumped up charge, especially if he can get Jonson out of jail for sedition. How does Shakespeare even get to see the earl in the first place? There is such a big deal made by Oxfordians about Will not having access to the nobility, yet in the movie he can see one whenever he wants.

Other unintentional laughs:

**The crowd seeing a few minutes of ""Richard III"" and then start yelling ""Essex, Essex"" and storming out of the theater. The parodying of Cecil's son was obvious but where did the audience get the idea to storm the palace yelling ""Essex""? How did they make that connection? Why not yell ""Steve"", it would make as much sense? Apparently, you'll never be able to watch the first few minutes of ""Richard III"" without thinking of ""Essex"" and starting a riot. And why would you leave so early? I don't know about you but I paid to get into this new show, I want to see it.`

**The ""Its a trap"" scene with the repeat fire muskets speaks for itself in the hysterical absurdity.

**Older Queen Elizabeth is demented out of her mind AND then she's not.

**The holding of her funeral on the frozen river. Regardless of how cold/frozen it was, would you really hold a state funeral on water and if its that cold why be outside in the first place?

**Eddie ""gotta keep my writing a secret"" De Vere making a big deal about being secret while the Cecils and the Queen know that its him all the time. There's never any discovery.
""Father, you're being parodied on stage in 'Hamlet'!""
""Oh that's just Edward at that devilish writing again.""

**Jonson disappears from the film for the length of a bible and then reappears at the end carrying on about how wonderful De Vere is. When exactly did they have time to foster such a close relationship? How about one scene where the two writers talk shop, inspirations, something in common for their calling?

**Making a big deal about ""Romeo and Juliet"" being written all in blank verse and then somebody saying that is not totally in verse. Oh, I guess then it wasn't such a big deal after all and Eddie lied about it being all in verse. I wondered what else he lied about?

**Ah incest...

**Filming scenes in dark locations. Yes, Emmrich, we understand there was no electrical lighting back then but it would be nice to actually see the actor's faces. Other period films don't seem to have an issue.

**Probably the worst joke of all, Derek Jacobi reviving his role of Chorus from Branagh's ""Henry V"". A modern dress narrator that starts out the movie in a theater. Also, no applause from the audience in the theater at the end of the film.

And the list goes on and on...

Regardless of the above I do think you could make an interesting narrative in DeVere's life although you would have to compromise part of the Theory. Is he the son of Elizabeth or lover - pick one and explore it for the juicy stuff that it would be. Shakespeare has to be literate and not a moron or he is, pick one. Rhys Ifans is actually very good in the role and if he was given a chance to be the actual protagonist with scenes that involved character development he would have been much more believable and sympathetic. To call the Cecils villains is too simplistic. As a villain Elmer Fudd has more motivation and character depth than these guys. The costumes and set designs are good although its been done far better in other films. Overall there are some good actors, what could have a good story but its poorly written, poorly directed, poorly shot and unintentionally funny but I guess that's what we can expect from the Oxfordian theory.",1329091200,9,4704,4.489461358313817

4978528,4,B0068MNNOE,"As someone who believes that Shakespeare did write his own plays, I am rather puzzled by the outright hostility that ANONYMOUS is receiving in some quarters. Most (but not all) of the negative reviews are from people who cannot get past the central conceit that someone else may have written them. ANONYMOUS never claims to be historically accurate. In fact it is littered with several blatant historical inaccuracies (Shakespeare murdering Christopher Marlowe 5 years after the fact, A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM written by a child of 10, Queen Elizabeth's funeral procession on a frozen river Thames, the Tudor Rose as a flower not an emblem) that make it quite clear that this is intended to be a work of historical fiction. So was SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE but no one got upset over that film at least not to the extent that they have here.

What we do have is a major ""what if"" scenario that works quite well as an Elizabethan costume drama with some seriously heavy overtones (""Delicious isn't it? Right out of a Greek tragedy"" says Robert Cecil toward the end). Edward Hogg's portrayal of Robert Cecil is outstanding and David Thewlis as his father William is virtually unrecognizable. Kudos also to Sebastian Armesto as a conflicted Ben Jonson. In fact, I found all of the performances to be solid and above average and they kept me interested in the proceedings. The recreation of Elizabethan London is marvelous and shows that CGI can be used to great effect (like glass painting in old Hollywood movies) without resorting to blowing things up. I truly got the feeling that I was actually watching a performance at the Globe Theater especially when the rain began to fall.

I should point out that I saw this film in a movie theater on more than one occasion. The last time was with a bunch of college students in attendance. While they knew that what they were seeing was historically false, they still got caught up in the dramatic storyline and were shaken by the final revelation(s) which is what classic tragedy is supposed to do. We had a lovely discussion afterwards, a 60 year man and a group of college students. It was refreshing and invigorating!

4978540,1,B0068MNNOE,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.

As a firm believer that William Shakespeare of Stratford wrote the plays attributed to him, I thought that ""Anonymous"" would make my blood boil with its myriad historical inaccuracies and its nonsensical conspiracy theories. Instead, it nearly put me to sleep. None of the characters aroused any interest or sympathy. None of the characters had any life, so how could they interest me? None of the characters had a character arc, meaning that no one significantly changes or grew during the film. (Well, that's not completely true. The young de Vere played by Jamie Campbell Bower seemed to be an immature horn dog, while the older de Vere played by Rhys Ifans seems to have no interest in sex at all, but that wasn't character growth - that was an unlikeable character mysteriously becoming a very different unlikeable character with no explanation for the change.) As Edward de Vere, Rhys Ifans attempted to show his poetic soul by looking constipated. He didn't show a shred of humor, which is decidedly odd for a man who supposedly (if he was the real author, as the Oxfordians would have it) wrote more comedies than tragedies. His character claims that art must be political or else it is merely decorative, but he never expressed any political beliefs in the film. He had a personal grudge against the Cecil family, but there is a difference between the personal and the political. (By the way, I find the statement that art must be political or else it is merely decorative to be the most offensive thing in the entire film.)

According to the film, Edward's consummate goal was to install Essex on the throne rather than James. But why did he care? Was it some sort of prejudice against the Scottish? Was it out of some sort of affection for Elizabeth? He lusted for her as a youth, but we never see him show any affection for her as a woman, rather than as sex object (when they were young). (And if he had felt any deep affection for Elizabeth, one would have to question why he would care for such an empty-headed libertine.) Did de Vere actually think Essex's political policies were superior to James's political policies? If so, why didn't the film ever differentiate between their policies? Does this mean that Oxford would have thought the screenplay of ""Anonymous"" was merely decorative?

As played by Ifans, de Vere didn't seem to have a passion for anything, or any joy in living. He didn't even enjoy writing - he wrote to keep his ""voices"" from troubling him. (At the very end of the film, he shows some love for his son, but by that point it was too late for me to care about this cold fish.)

Perhaps I shouldn't have been surprised that I was bored. I have long thought that it would be difficult to make a film with Oxford as the hero of an ""Oxfordian"" movie, because you would either have to portray him as a prig who was ashamed of writing ""Hamlet,"" or as someone who would like to have taken credit, but was too big a wimp to say anything. This film manages to portray Oxford (at least when he is Ifans) as both a wimp and a prig.

The film did not bother me primarily for the way it treated William Shakespeare. It bothered me primarily because it was so damned boring.

Even if you accept the premises of the film, it doesn't make sense on its own terms. Queen Elizabeth is not presented as a Puritan (quite the opposite) and she clearly enjoys plays. Why, at the very end of the film, does she suddenly insist that de Vere's name never be on the plays? That comes completely out of left field. And Robert Cecil is supposed to be an ultimate political games-player and spy master. Why doesn't he know that the man he installs as King likes plays? Why did de Vere first learn about the power of plays to move people when he was a mature man (played by Ifans) who attended a public performance of a play by Ben Jonson? According to the film, de Vere had already written ""Romeo & Juliet"" and the ""Henry IV"" plays and had them performed at

What I do know is that ANONYMOUS is a fascinating, totally engrossing motion picture; a revisionist history, part political thriller, that provides a possible answer to one of the world's great mysteries.

Directed by Roland Emmerich, John Orloff's script seamlessly moves back-and-forth between several time periods, as it recounts the tale of a nobleman of questionable birth who writes magnificent plays and sonnets, yet because of the political environment of the era, must let another takes credit for them.  Much of the drama centers on court intrigues involving Elizabeth, brilliantly portrayed in her later years by Vanessa Redgrave and, as a younger woman, by Redgrave's daughter, Joely Richardson.

I am not going to divulge specific plot details, because that would make me a spoiler and this saga has too many deliciously intriguing twists-and-turns that a viewer should discover for himself.

The entire cast, which includes David Thewlis (as the nefarious Robert Cecil), Jamie Campbell Bower (as the younger Edward De Vere) and Derek Jacobi, who bookends the story as sort of a narrator, are magnificent.

ANONYMOUS, which has received an Oscar nomination for Best Costume Design, uses CGI to craft an astounding recreation of Elizabethan England.

Extras on the DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment include audio commentary with Emmerich and Orloff, deleted scenes and a featurette, ""Who Is the Real William Shakespeare?"".

""Anonymous"" clearly leads the pack, but we also have the story of Freud vs. Jung well told in ""A Dangerous Method"" spy thriller ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"", the high finance ""Margin Call"" and Ralph Fiennes' tour d'force ""Coriolanus"".

""Anonymous"" gives us the popular theory that Will Shakespeare was not the author of the works which bear his name. The film stars Rhys Ifans as the Earl of Oxford, Vanessa Redgrave as Queen Elizabeth, Rafe Spall as Shakespeare, and Sebastian Armesto as Ben Johnson. To the average viewer only Redgrave's name will be familiar.

Welsh born Rhys Ifans is probably best known for his role as Spike in ""Notting Hill"" (1999) and as Xenophilius Lovegood in ""Harry Potter and the Deadly Hallows"" (2010), although he won a BAFTA for ""Not Only But Always"", a 2004 TV movie. His performance here is great, showing great maturity compared to some of his earlier films.

Rafe Spall is best known to British TV viewers although he did appear in several films including a role as Jonathan Harker in a 2006 version of ""Dracula"" and played Noel in ""Shaun of the Dead"" (2004).

German born Roland Emmerich produced and directed the film. Emmerich is best known for his work as writer and director of the block buster hit ""Independence Day"" (1996) as well as ""Stargate"" (1994), ""Godzilla"" (1998), ""The Day After Tomorrow"" (2004). ""Anonymous"" is a clear change of pace for Emmerich, however, it handles it very well.

There's lots of material for those who are interested in Shakespeare and his plays, plus a secondary plot about politics (almost mandatory in any British film) as well as fabled stories about the sexcapades of the Virgin Queen.

BTW - Redgrave does a great job as the Queen, but my personal favorite remains Bette Davis.

The costumes, photography (and new CGI technology) and scenery are breath taking, giving us the feeling that we are really in 17th Century England.

The film earned over $1 million in its opening weekend in the US in October 2011, which is a poor showing given the $30 million budget. Through the end of the year the total earnings were about $15 million.

Roger Ebert called the film ""ingenious"" and ""a marvelous historical film"" and Rex Reed called it a ""dazzling panorama of Tudor history"". Variety, however, was disappointed and said the drama ""veers close to comedy"" and the reporter from The New Yorker found it too confusing.

Bottom line - a clever, entertaining look at Tudor England and the works of Shakespeare.

""All art is political...Otherwise it would just be decoration."" So says Edward deVere, 17th Earl of Oxford, ""our Shake-speare"" in ""Anonymous."" Poetry, drama and theater genius. The ""stigma of print"" for the nobility. Puritan hatred of theaters, plays, actors. ""Words, words, words"" vs. swords. The ""policy of plays."" Authorial pseudonyms. Italy immersion, obsession.

These topics, politics and events are skillfully distilled and woven by ""Anonymous"" screenwriter John Orloff and director Emmerich into intricate, provocative content.

Truly memorable scenes abound in ""Anonymous."" Our first and last views of Vanessa Redgrave's aged, regal Elizabeth I are visually haunting. The ""Henry V"" public stage debut is magical, spellbinding - even more so as we see and hear it along with four mesmerized, dumb-struck Elizabethan authors and Oxford. Compelling too is the scene where Oxford tells his wife why he must write, why he cannot stop. Oxford is ... what he is. To his wife, he is possessed. To Sir Robert Cecil (a hunchback, Oxford's Machiavellian brother-in-law, chief counselor to Elizabeth I and the likely puppetmeister of the King James' succession), Oxford is a threat, a menace, an embarrassment. When Cecil vexes Oxford with his last secrets, tormenting Oxford about his career failures and what might have been, the great author's personal disappointment, decay and tragedy is molten. Oxford's earthly release from his obsession occurs at the emotional climax of the movie: de Vere's final words with Ben Jonson who is admonished not to betray Shake-speare's plays, notwithstanding BJ's small view  of Stratford actor Shaksper.  Finally, the concluding look on Cecil's face after the newly crowned King James lisps his love of theater is priceless, unforgettable.

Ever wonder why Elizabeth I would name as her successor the son of her dangerous Stuart cousin, Mary Queen of Scots, she who plotted unsuccessfully Eliza's assassination? Or why the actor Shaksper, putative playwright from Stratford, was not jailed, mutilated or hanged for his politically audacious and incendiary plays and poems? You will not be alone in so wondering. That which flew by oddly, curiously, incomplete from Tudor history books and academic Bard orthodoxy can be revisited, retested, reshaped, savored and supplemented with this DVD and a companion Pictorial Moviebook (bought also from Amazon and recommended highly).

Yes, this film will irk fact checkers and historians. Richard III was not a hunchback. But Elizabeth's final chief counselor was. Art becomes political, Elizabethan politics became art.",1325548800,24,3561,5.767619047619047
4978550,5,B0068MNNOE,"Roland Emmerich's new film, Anonymous, is inspired by the same theory that gripped Sigmund Freud during the last dozen years of his life--that ""William Shakespeare"" was the pseudonym and front man of Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford (1550-1604). When you see this film and ponder its thesis, I hope you will remind yourself that Freud was passionately intrigued by the likelihood that de Vere was Shakespeare. Before long, I predict Freud will be vindicated. The film has generated much debate, some of it acrimonious. Yet the Anonymous website has a poll showing that only 51% of visitors still believe the traditional author wrote the canon.

 When his wife Anne pleads with de Vere to stop writing plays, he replies, ""The voices! I can't stop them. They come to me. I would go mad if I didn't write down what the voices say."" This is an intriguing surmise about de Vere's creative process, as though his Muse speaks to him aloud. In fact, I suspect that some form of unusual awareness and tolerance of multiple self states plays a crucial role for some literary geniuses such as de Vere.

 Psychoanalysts are in a unique position to elucidate the psychology of literary anonymity and pseudonymity. The evidence suggests that keeping one's authorship secret helps promote what Keats called Shakespeare's ""negative capability""--keeping his own identity in the background as he created hundreds of utterly convincing characters. In a sense, Edward de Vere's most magical character of all was his pseudonym and front man, ""William Shakespeare."" With some likely assistance from the man from Stratford, this character lives on for most people more vividly than does de Vere himself. Why did de Vere have to conceal his authorship? For many reasons. Nobility did not write for the common theater. They rarely published poems under their own name during their lifetime. And the plays of Shakespeare spoof many powerful court figures, and comment on various court intrigues.

  The film has de Vere tell Ben Jonson, ""All art is political."" Attributing the plays' authorship to a commoner helped conceal some of their provocative critiques. Even so, the Elizabethan theater audience as depicted in the film recognized the character Richard III as a spoof of de Vere's hunch-backed brother-in-law, Robert Cecil. They also recognized Polonius in Hamlet as a disguised portrayal of de Vere's father-in-law. Some Shakespeare scholars still admit the latter is correct, though others have backed off from this identification, since it strengthens the case for de Vere's authorship.

 You may have read some of the vitriolic attacks on Anonymous by Columbia University's James Shapiro and others. This fierce backlash intrigues me. The academic Shakespeare establishment usually treats the authorship question as taboo. In other words, many Shakespeare organizations and publications will not even discuss it. One English professor told me it would be ""academic suicide""  to research de Vere's possible authorship. A Shakespearean publication invited me to write a book review, then changed their mind once they read it, explaining that they had ""blundered,"" and would never publish anything by an Oxfordian (that is, someone who thinks de Vere, Earl of Oxford, wrote the works of Shakespeare).

 Both Emmerich and Orloff admit their film takes poetic license in order to provoke and entertain. But the Stratfordians are not amused. Their over-reaction to the film is Inquisitional in its tone. We instinctively sympathize with the underdog, all things being equal. The Shakespeare establishment may have made things worse for itself by forgetting this is just a film.

 Many of the reviews of Anonymous have panned the film because its premise is so controversial. A common theme in these critical reviews is the assumption that the Shakespeare scholars must be correct, and there is ""no evidence whatsoever"" that Shakespeare did not write Shakespeare. Certain premises are repeatedly asserted to be incontrovertible refutations that de Vere could be the author. You've  heard that many plays of Shakespeare are known with certainty to have been written after 1604, the year that de Vere died. But, as some Shakespeare scholars admit, we simply do not know with certainty when any of the plays were written. The conventional dating of the plays is based on Shakespeare of Stratford having died in 1616. So it was assumed he wrote roughly two plays per year, and these assumptions played a crucial if circular role in the conjectural dating of when the plays were written.

The Sept. 11, 2014 education supplement of The Times of London published an article about the Stratfordian Gary Taylor suppressing an updated article on The Psychology of Shakespearean Biography that was requested by the former co-editors of an Italian Shakespeare journal. He seems to have pressured them to resign. The story was also covered in the national edition of The Times the following day (as well as in The Telegraph-- that story has drawn over 2,000 online comments, far fewer than this review!).

4978551,4,B0068MNNOE,"I always accepted the idea that Shakespeare wrote his own plays, and considered anything to the contrary to be merely speculation not fact. So, the premise-what if Shakespeare never wrote a word, I found not to be appealing.

Upon reading some good reviews, I decided to see it, and found it to be a high quality production and a wonderful experience. Director Roland Emmerich previously directed 2012, and Independence Day, and writer John Orloff previously wrote some episodes of Band of Brothers, and as you watch this movie you will realise this term BoB originated with Shakespeare.

Anonymous proposes the Earl of Oxford wrote all the plays, anonymously donated them to Ben Johnson, a well known writer of the time for him to take credit. Then an uncouth illiterate actor, named Shakespeare steps in to claim the credit. The peer remained anonymous for reasons of social acceptability.

Another reason he may have remained anonymous which I totally loved was the parallel structure between what happened in the plays, and the real life events of the courtiers and Queen Elizabeth. Cecil, the courtier villain in this movie is a hunchback (historical fact), and brother in law of the Earl of Oxford. Richard 3 in Shakespeare's play is a hunchback, so the play becomes a social satire.

A scene where a man is stabbed through a curtain mirrors a scene in Hamlet. A usurped heir is sent to Ireland, and there is a plot to kill him, similar to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in Hamlet.

Emmerich's direction gives Anonymous a much grander scope. We have big set pieces, such as a rebel attack on a bridge leading to the tower of London, rowing a boat in the Thames with the London skyline looming behind, an aerial shot of a huge crowd in the snow, and visual scenes of quite unsanitary London of the time, and he evokes the period very well. For example it rains on the actor in the theater, as he recites his lines. Certain scenes play out in ways we have not scene before, particularly Hamlet's soliloquy where he holds a knife, Richard 3 as caricature, crowd interaction and participation, sweet talking bawdy ladies with Shakespeare's words. I loved this. Visually outstanding, with exquisite and intricate costumes.

I liked the lead actors charisma and presence. He was so in character and looked older for the part that I did not recognise him till the credits. Rhys Ifans starred in Notting Hill, and Pirate Radio. He does a terrific job, perhaps his best work, as does the actor who plays Johnson. There is a particular scene between the two of them at the end that makes me tear up even as I write. Derek Jacobi, begins and ends the movie opening and closing the premise.

Vanessa Redgrave plays the doddering confused queen, and her daughter Joely Richardson plays her younger self, who has a torrid affair with the Earl of Oxford when she was young, producing an illicit heir. The queen has several torrid affairs which become part of the plot of succession. Shakespeare was played by Rafe Spall, son of Timothy Spall, who you have probably seen in several movies.

If the screenwriter was hoping to persuade me, he certainly made me think. Perhaps he goes too overboard with Shakespeare having a unique form of illiteracy, he can read words and memorise them but he can't write, and yet he is a scheming manipulative lout, a criminal, a drunkard, a successful entrepreneur, and a sociopath. Asked to speak to a crowd he stumbles inarticulately over his words. If Shakespeare was as inarticulate, and uneducated as portrayed, how could he have convinced anyone of his genius when he lacked the most basic skills of expression.

If not Shakespeare, then who?

Almost two centuries passed before anyone seriously questioned Shakespeare's authorship. It has been suggested that Sir Francis Bacon wrote these plays, but why would an already famous writer still living when Shakespeare's First Folio was published in 1623 give credit to someone else. DeVere appears to be the current favorite among conspiracy theorists. If DeVere was excluded from the court, as he is in the movie then he would not be in a position to satirise the court, or include such pointed commentary in his plays. DeVere as a child in the movie performs a piece from Midsummer nights dream for the queen. He could hardly have written it as an adult then, could he? Curiously, at times the movie appears to undermine its own premise.

According to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Who-Wrote-Shakespeare/dp/0500281130/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Who Wrote Shakespeare?</a>&nbsp;by John Michell, 26 different candidates have been proposed as the author of Shakespeare.  I consider this an outstanding and well researched book, which lists all the candidates, and argues pro and con without taking sides, and is a good source of facts including Jonson's eulogy, and details about the Bard's will.  Another book available on Kindle,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Who-Wrote-Shakespeare/dp/B005HF4DYC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Who Wrote Shakespeare?</a>&nbsp;by James Shapiro argues the established view, and rebuts alternative authorship. It's worth exploring both these books to have a more global understanding of all the issues.

In the movie Ben Johnson proclaims sincere affection for DeVere's language skills.
In reality, Ben Johnson famously said of Shakespeare: ""he would... buy the reversion of old plays,""but then mark not whose 'twas first: and after-times may judge it to be his...""On Poet Ape.

The movie claims no manuscript written by Shakespeare survives. If you don't have evidence that Shakespeare wrote something, does that mean you have evidence someone else wrote it? You cannot infer alternative authorship from a negation, only from evidence. If you have evidence that these plays were previously written, and performed or were adapted from books, then you can verify that Shakespeare was not the originator, merely wrote a version, and credit the original source. It seems that with some of these plays, they were circulating already, and then Shakespeare wrote a version, or made his own adaptation, which then became the definitive version.

Only 18 of the 36 plays in the First Folio of 1623, were previously published during Shakespeare's lifetime.  Eight of those 18 were published anonymously. A further 9 plays, pirated versions, previously published under the name of Shakespeare were rejected as Shakespeare plays.

In 1619 10 plays were published in what has become known as the False Folio.  Later, in 1664 seven new plays would be published in the Third and Fourth Folios but most are rejected as Shakespeare plays today.

Some of these plays in addition to the 1609 Sonnets were apparently published without Shakespeare's authority or consent, and quickly pulled by the publisher. In addition there were several other plays such as Taming a Shrew 1594, King Leir 1605,  First part of the contention 1595, Troublesome Raigne of King John 1591 all published anonymously but not attributed to Shakespeare.

The Passionate Pilgrime 1612 edition initially published under Shakespeare's name was reissued without Shakespeare's name following a complaint by writer Thomas Heywood.  Only 5 of the poems published in the 1599 edition of Passionate Pilgrim are attributed to Shakespeare with certainty by Shakespearean scholarhsip.

Undoubtedly, this movie will stimulate debate and controversy. The idea that he didn't write a single word goes too far in my opinion, it would be interesting to know for sure what he did and did not write. I do think this is one of the best movies I have seen all year.

Wherever you stand on this, I highly recommend you see it, consider it, and form your own opinion. If you're like me, it's too tabloidy to be taken seriously, the once virgin queen now a nympho, having an illegitimate son with the real Shakespeare, and so on.

Even if like me you do not agree with the premise, you might be surprised to discover you still love the movie.

I think you will enjoy it, and I hope this was helpful.",1324944000,222,8125,5.154255319148936
4978552,5,B0068MNNOE,"The plot of the movie ""Anonymous"" is intriguing, and certainly it merits viewing, for the question of authorship is an important one for reasons that most people do not yet fully grasp.  Though it may hint at the truth, it seems to me that it does not quite go far enough.  I know of several sources that lend credence to the view that not the Earl of Oxford, Edward de Verre, but Sir Francis Bacon, secret heir to England's throne, and founder of the Rosicrucian secret literary society, was the real author of the plays as well as numerous other literary works penned and published during that era under various pseudonyms.  It begs the question why would a member of the nobility write secretly and hire a semi-illiterate and relatively uneducated man from Stratford to take credit for the most brilliant works ever written in English literature?
  The most compelling testimony for me lies in three diverse sources of information that together point to the true authorship of the plays.  One of these sources is Alfred Dodd's book ""Francis Bacon's Personal Life-Story"".  Though written several centuries after the time of Shakespeare it lays out meticulously researched letters and documents that allude to Francis Bacon's true identity as the illegitimate son of Queen Elizabeth and Robert Dudley, and the author of the plays.  Dodd's thesis is that though Elizabeth never openly acknowledged him as her son and heir to England's throne she apparently secretly supported and funded his efforts to create a literary naissance in England.  Herself a well-educated woman with a passion for higher learning, she sponsored his efforts to galvanize the language with a grammatical syntax, as well as importing and ""anglesizing"" words from other languages capable of conveying abstract, higher thought.  Prior to that time all scholarly work and literature had to be written in Latin, Greek, French or Italian and was thus available only to a minority;  the wealthy, educated of England.  Many ideas we take for granted and openly discuss today were considered politically treacherous and certain to cause a political backlash among those who wished to maintain the pre-renaissance status quo.  The necessity for secrecy in such an endeavor was paramount.  In order to move England (and Europe) out of the dark ages in which it had been so long immersed Elizabeth I and Francis Bacon needed to secretly forge the means at the same time that they were publicly feigning ignorance, all the while holding a delicate political balance between various factions and historical forces that existed during that era.
  Before Elizabeth's reign an English language that could be used to create literary works as we know it today was non-existent.  According to Dodd's premise, though she did not openly sponsor these publications, the Queen tacitly supported Bacon and funded his writing because of her very personal connection with him.  She also valued the higher purpose of his efforts, namely to raise the intellect and the moral sensibility of the common man who did not have the education to read and write, but who could engage in learning through viewing the performance of theatrical plays.  Elizabeth I was known to be a woman of exceptional determination who, despite her personal character flaws, did wish to promote the welfare of all her loyal subjects, regardless of low or high birth.  Thus, her secret support of Francis Bacon's endeavors is not a far-fetched premise.
  Alfred Dodd also makes reference to encrypted information within the writings (plays and poems) that identify Bacon as the author.  Cryptography was the norm during those politically dangerous times as a form of conveying information secretly.  Ciphers with Francis Bacon's name, as well as numerological references to Pallas Athena (a.k.a. Ascended Master Pallas Athena) appear in many of the works.  Athena was said to be his sponsor and inspiration, in a divine sense, and the name Shake-spear is an allusion to her.  She was a divine being known to the ancient Greeks, and the patroness of Athens, and is often portrayed holding a spear.  As the spear-shaker she was the one who stamps out ignorance (the serpent who often appears in statues depicting her) and upholds truth, wisdom, and divine intelligence in the hearts and minds of men and women who ask for her assistance.  The synchronicity of the name Shakespeare with Sir Francis's muse, Pallas Athena, inspired Bacon's choice of William Shakespeare from Stratford as the nom de plume for his plays.  Shakespeare of Stradford also had a connection with the theater and that made him the perfect choice for one who wished to remain anonymous, as it lent more credence to the ruse.
  A connection between Francis Bacon, the Shakespeare writings, and the Ascended Masters is reinforced by two additional sources of information, namely, the books of Gary Renard, as well as the collected transcripts of discourses and dictations known as the Teachings of the Ascended Masters.  ""The Disappearance of the Universe"" and ""Your Immortal Reality"" by Gary Renard both allude to a nobleman in the Queen's court who authored the plays.  The reason given:  the Queen would not permit nobility to openly engage in activities related to the theatre, as her public persona considered it undignified and vulgar for the members of her court to be involved in such.  Both of these books make reference to the author of the plays as a court noble who is now an  ""Ascended Master"", though they do not reveal his identity.
  Though Gary Renard does not identify the author of the plays, it is well known by those who are familiar with the teachings of the Ascended Masters that Francis Bacon was the final lifetime of the Ascended Master known as St. Germain.  Also, it is commonly accepted among contemporary students of the Ascended Masters that Francis Bacon was the true author of the plays.  It is taken for granted by those engaged in the Ascended Master teachings that Francis Bacon was a noble in the Queen's court and that he had both the education, as well as the brilliance of mind to have created these works.  That he took such care to divert attention from himself as the real author and was so successful in that accomplishment that the authorship is still a matter of intense debate, demonstrates in itself the maneuvering of a brilliant, as well as humble man.  The success of Bacon's anonymous writings and the need of the hour  to raise humanity up out of the ""dark ages""  was more important to him than the personal sacrifice of recognition and public accolades, and he even set aside his own ambitions for the succession to the throne in order to pursue these ends.  He knew that the source of the writings was divine in origin, and that personal credit was not of significant  importance to him.  That he hid his identity behind pseudonyms so well that centuries of scholarly inquiry have still not unearthed the entire truth, makes this film ""Anonymous"" all the more fascinating to watch.
  It seems the truth is that no matter who you believe wrote the plays and poetry the name and identity of the author is of no import.  The paradox of ""Anonymous"" in itself reveals a brilliance that reaches beyond the scope of mundane human understanding, since in the divine oneness of God personas are irrelevant, and whether we ever agree on which persona created the plays does not really matter.  For isn't it the brilliance of the mind connected with creative divine Source that is important rather than the personal life story of the human who holds the pen?  When we surrender the ego to the point that the mind becomes illumined and brilliant, the personal truth becomes  ""I am but a pencil in the hand of God"" (Mother Theresa).  I believe the author of the Shakespeare plays set up a riddle for us to solve that points to a divine mystery, whereby to get to the truth within the mystery we will have to set aside the barriers imposed by the limited human intellect and stretch credibility beyond our current beliefs and perceptions.  Perhaps that was the ultimate divine purpose of the mystery created by anonymity.  Was the human or the divine mind the true author of the plays?  Now that, to me, is the most significant and intriguing question raised by this movie, and one worthy the effort of full and determined investigation.",1322352000,,8368,4.924447612259444
4978553,2,B0068MNNOE,"I am going to commit heresy.  I was one of the few who did not like ""Shakespeare in Love.""  I thought the idea of making Shakespeare look like an idiot was offensive to the man who created the most inspired works of English literature - of unmitigated genius.

Then this film comes along and introduces a Shakespeare even more ridiculous - even illiterate - can't even write letters.

I understand that there are some scholars who dispute Shakespeare's authorship.  Although I side with the view that these scholars are wrong - there are at least some serious arguments.

This film ignores all of it.  [Even Queen Elizabeth seems unable to make decisions without the guidance of her counselors].  Please miss this one.",1322352000,2,718,4.827868852459017

Snippets of Shakespeare plays staged imaginatively as they might have been and birdseye views of London made this worth seeing whether or not you buy into the authorship question. There aren't enough epic history movies these days so this one was a treat. Vanessa Redgrave is a credible Elizabeth I in her later years but the palaces, theaters, streets, taverns and cityscapes are the real stars.

4978555,4,B0068MNNOE,"I was getting far too comfortable seeing Rhys Ifans (Notting Hill, Pirate Radio, The Replacements) playing shaggy, directionless buffoons.  FINALLY he has received a strong lead giving a command performance as the Earl of Oxford.  In this compelling period piece it is he, and not the otherwise famed name, who actually penned the works of William Shakespeare.  Growing up in a noble household in which poetry and theater are analogous with sin, he finds himself the recipient of voices, rich with prosaic observations of life, which plague him until they are inked to parchment.  The products of which are the works of Shakespeare.

 This comes to pass as the Earl bribes a mediocre playwright (Ben Johnson, played by Sebation Armesto) to claim his plays as his own.  However, when the time comes to assume credit before his invigorated audience, Johnson hesitates.  Opportunistically, William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall), a desperate actor in the play privy to Johnson's secret deal, steps forward and assumes the role.  What ensues is a web of political deception and betrayal, littered with twists which culminate in a tale more tragic than ""Shakespeare"" himself ever penned.  While I'd love to explain how, I'm NO SPOILER.

 Online reviews of Anonymous vary wildly in ratings from ""amazing"" to ""boring.""  While I advocate that my opinion is unique to any other and we all have our preferences, I have difficulty understanding how anyone but an ill-educated child could possibly find this ""boring"" unless we're confusing ""boring"" with plotty or ""I didn't like it.""  In defense of other aspects of this film, the set design and cinematography (occasionally CGI-enhanced) didn't quite receive the budget it deserved.  At first, this was disappointing.  However, as I watched on, I appreciated how the budget was used and enjoyed shots of poverty-stricken cityscapes and aerial views of gross architecture.  I get it--these sets are expensive.  It is also worth mentioning that I did not enjoy the characters of William Shakespeare and Ben Johnson.  These characters do little more than serve humbly as the spoon delivering the castor oil that is the ""truth"" of the plot.  I won't rule out that they could have been written considerably better, but this movie is more about the Earl of Oxford, political subterfuge, and his secret.  It's not about the over-the-top, illiterate William Shakespeare.  In fact, the least tragic element of this movie was Shakespeare's fraud.

 My defense of these flaws clearly identifies my stance on the movie.  I liked it a lot--really, I loved it.  Rhys Ifans has never failed to entertain me, but has never entertained me like this.  The Earl is strong yet desperate, vulnerable with respect to his work yet callous to his wife and civic responsibilities, and deeply methodical yet inconsiderate of consequence.  The Earl is the object of political and romantic turns which drive the story forward, and he is well-complemented by the Queen (played young and old by Joely Richardson of Nip/Tuck and Vanessa Redgrave, respectively) and the manipulative Cecils (played by David Thewlis and Edward Hogg).

 By the way, the ending...very heavy, very touching, very real.  I was truly affected.",1322006400,4,3221,5.16023166023166
4978556,1,B0068MNNOE,"The question of the authorship regarding the ""first folio"" is a very valid one.  So when a SFX bonanza director takes camera, crew and cast in hand to create one of the most appalling addresses of the issue, one cannot but wonder what possessed him to even consider making the script in the first place.

The whole thing smacks of a paranoid fantasy gone awry.  As if someone took a syringe of ""paranoid serum"" and injected it into the celluloid or hard drive upon which the images were gathered.  It's as if the screenwriter and everyone else on the bandwagon of questioning the authorship decided to get in on the joke and make a farce of a film that plays up to every conspiracy hack's nightmare come true.

The technical merits of the film are fine, but the trouncing of beliefs by the critical thinkers who wonder if William Shakespeare actually penned the plays and poems he did, is taken to new heights of ""I am an actor, believe in the emotional correctness of my position... therefore I am, and anybody who challenges that, is dead wrong, and unworthy of consideration"".

I mean, wow.  The idea of wanting a confident persona to play a part for a stage play or film is all well and fine, but when those people substitute critical analysis for emotional hubris, one can't help but be glad that they are not mathematicians, detectives, judges, lawyers, chemists, physicists, engineers of all stripes, and any other career that requires left brain conviction in facts and the mechanisms that churn those facts to present truth.  One truly is glad of that.

But a person wonders, have any of them really considered the arguments, or are they just there trying to garnish yet another set of praises and appeal for the sake of a stroke of ego and dollar signs?  Probably the later.  The research is too long and boring, and challenges the emotional investment they have and that of their friends.  It's a very incestuous relationship being in a theatre troupe, because no one wants to be confronted with the cold hard logic of ""you're wrong"".

Because the minute you do that, you tear away at their being.  So it is with this film.  A piece of cinematic trash created to draw out the lunatics of society who believe that Edward De Vere by himself penned all the great literary works of our time.  And that William Shakespeare was nothing more than a whoring buffoon with money on his mind.

The amount of effort that went into this production is phenomenol.  But alas, it is for naught (oops, did I mispell a word?  Naughty me), as the obligatorily and mercifully free from intelligence and analysis thereof, have taken camera, lights, sets, stage and location in hand, and created a visually appealing, but substance-lacking, cinematic experience.

Me, I think I would've preferred to rent ""Porky's"" than watch this drivel again.  A real piece of cinematic trash that belongs on the ash pile of history.

Having worked with and known many actors (including some current coworkers) I'd like to think that any person, regardless of their walk of life, their vocation, profession, avenue they've taken, will stand on their own two feet and say ""You know, I wonder about this subject, and I just don't really know, but here's what I think...""  Yet, born and bread to be inserted into a clique and servitude of social popularity, those involved with the film, save one man, will not.  They will don their skills, ""act"" as if outraged that the truth has been with held for nearly a millennial, and then smirk to those who believe in them that the ""crazies"" have finally had their say with their piece of work.

Could a production team be any more insulting?

Skip this film.

It's trash.",1321833600,6,3685,4.6993769470404985
4978557,1,B0068MNNOE,"I expected ""Anonymous"" to anger me; I did not expect it to bore me.  It starts out with a lie, when Derek Jacobi says that Shakespeare's daughter's were ""irrefutably illiterate.""  One (Susanna) signed her name.  How does that equal ""irrefutably illiterate""?  It has numerous historical inaccuracies.  But the worst part is that it is deadly dull.  Rhys Ifans plays de Vere as a man who keeps everything so bottled up, he seems to be suffering from constant constipation.  For a man who (according to the Oxfordians) wrote so many comedies, it is odd that he never once demonstrates a sense of humor.  He doesn't seem to enjoy ANYTHING.  Why are his plays so full of life when he is not?  And setting aside the ludicrous conspiracy/authorship theories, the film makes no sense on its own terms.  Supposedly Oxford first learns that plays have the power to move people when, as an adult, he attends one of Ben Jonson's plays.  But according to ""Anonymous,"" de Vere has been writing plays like ""Romeo & Juliet"" and had them performed at court for years.  That never gave him the idea that plays could move people?  And de Vere says that plays without politics are mere decoration, but he doesn't seem to have ANY political beliefs himself, except for a grudge against his adoptive relatives.

4978559,2,B0068MNNOE,"`Anonymous' takes certain facts from Tudor history and weaves an entertaining and exciting story around them, incorporating more than one conspiracy theory.  It has an all-star cast and is visually superb, and well-acted.  Vanessa Redgrave and her daughter Joely Richardson make a perfect pair as the older and younger versions of Queen Elizabeth I.  We marvel at the re-creation of Tudor London; but it is all pretty silly, in historical terms.

It is true that, in 1601, the Earl of Essex was involved in a conspiracy to seize power, was thwarted by William Cecil, and executed in the Tower of London.  It is also true that the Earl of Southampton was involved in the plot; that he was a patron of William Shakespeare, and may have been the mysterious `Mr .W.H.', to whom the poet's Sonnets were dedicated; but much of the rest of the film - including the fundamental idea that it was the Earl of Oxford who wrote Shakespeare's plays - is fantasy.

Some respectable scholars have entertained doubts as to the authorship of the plays; and the Earl of Oxford has been proposed as an alternative, along with Sir Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe and the Earl of Derby.  Derek Jacobi and Mark Rylance, who star in this film, are both on record as `Oxfordians'; but their fame, and any success which `Anonymous' may have, should not lend respectability to the theory.  It was first proposed in 1920 in his book 'Shakespeare Identified', by a somewhat eccentric English schoolmaster, J. Thomas Looney (sic), who chose to ignore the fact that the Earl of Oxford died in 1604, whereas the plays kept appearing for several years after that.  Shakespeare, by the way, died in 1616).  Two of Looney's followers developed the theory that Oxford and Queen Elizabeth I had been lovers and had produced a son; but Looney himself rejected that idea, since he feared that it would bring his original theory into disrepute.

The makers of `Anonymous' seem to have no such fear.  They suggest, not only that Elizabeth and Oxford had a child together (the Earl of Southampton), but also that Elizabeth was Oxford's mother - so that incest, and a double dose of illicit sex are added to the heady brew.  They also have Oxford writing all Shakespeare's plays, even those which appeared after his own death; and they portray Shakespeare himself as an illiterate buffoon, whereas in real life he attended a grammar school in Stratford, where he would have received a rigorous education.  Meanwhile Elizabeth I is shown as Cecil's dupe, at least in her dotage, which it is difficult to believe that she ever was.

Of course, Shakespeare himself took liberties with the facts; but the film takes too many.  It is also open to the same objection as many conspiracy theories.  A rational observer is bound to think that, if all this were true, and so many people were involved, somebody would have spilled the beans.  Moreover, if we apply Ockham's razor to the problem, we must conclude, along with A.L.Rowse, Stanley Wells, Stephen Greenblatt, Bill Bryson, Trevor Nunn and many others, that it was Shakespeare who wrote Shakespeare; and, if that is so, this film is little more than a variation on a theme by J. Thomas Looney.

8494808,4,B0068MNNOE,"Director Roland Emmerich is more know for his big budget disaster movies, but he chooses nuance and mindfulness in Anonymous. It is certainly his greatest film and most well done piece. He recreates Shakespearean era England with care and attention to detail. With darkness and mud abundant, Emmerich's crew nails the period's costumes and makeup. His writer John Orloff forms appropriate language for the time and a fascinating story. If you can forgive Orloff's lack of evidence behind the theory that William Shakespeare did not write his own plays, Emmerich treats you to a thoroughly entertaining movie.

I found myself immensely enjoying the acting of this superb cast. Rhys Ifans delivers a subtle and emotional performance as The Earl of Oxford. Ifans emotes so carefully with each facial expression and delicately spoken word. You can tell Ifans truly tried to play The Earl as thoughtfully as possible. Anonymous is my favorite role of Ifans because of his nuanced approach.

Furthermore, Edward Hogg gives a masterful performance as Robert Cecil. He portrays the Cecil's vile and calculating nature with apparent ease. He makes for a convincing villain. His sullen looks hide the contempt behind his eyes. The audience is treated not only by one great Cecil, but two with the addition of David Thewlis as William Cecil. Thewlis also plays it cool with an inner rage and disgust for plays and words. He marks Cecil for the Puritanical schemer history knows the Cecils as now.

Additionally, Anonymous harbors a slew of interesting supporting roles. Vanessa Redgrave is fun as crazed and romantic Elizabeth I. Sebastian Armesto is quite sympathetic as poet and playwright Ben Jonson. I thoroughly enjoyed Trystan Gravelle as the great playwright and poet Christopher ""Kit"" Marlowe. Finally, Derek Jacobi is the perfect choice for Anonymous' narrator.

Herein lies the problem with Anonymous: Rafe Spall. Spall is funny as a comedic actor, but his portrayal of William Shakespeare is so idiotic and lecherous, Anonymous instantly feels more synthetic. I wish Spall would have played Shakespeare a bit more likable or complex. As is, Spall's performance is contrived to say the least. He is really overacting. I think he loses the audience that wants to believe in William Shakespeare the brilliant writer.

Also, the score from Austrian composers Harald Kloser and Thomas Wander is quite enchanting. It keeps you in the time period with a bit of romance and excitement.

In all, Anonymous is a great movie and my favorite from Roland Emmerich despite its contrived efforts to undermine Shakespeare's legacy. It tells an interesting story in a beautiful and captivating way. The acting is overall quite excellent and even moving at times. I would recommend Anonymous to anyone who can put aside their feelings about Shakespeare and enjoy a neat film for its own merits.",1528070400,,2876,5.160944206008583
