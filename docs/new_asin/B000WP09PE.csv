8224928,1,B000WP09PE,"There should not be attention brought to these dangerous people, but bin laden is a nazi of the 21st generation and his extremism is being infused on LOTS of people today.

in real life, bin laden married his cousin, he was actually inbred and his parents were related, he has had over 50 wives, some of whom are under 18 years of age which makes him a petaphyle.",1297728000,,363,4.338235294117647
8224929,3,B000WP09PE,"It's hard to find a realistic assessment of Bin Laden.  He's either a genius or a messiah, and I think he's neither.  I think he's very intelligent, he's brilliant in assessing people's strengths and weaknesses but in the end, he's a man who can make mistakes.  This dvd makes Bin Laden out to be a genius mastermind with apparently no weaknesses or flaws and I don't buy that.  Another program on Bin Laden that I also found fascinating is the recent History Channel's 10 Ways to Kill Bin Laden which goes over the same material as this one.  In terms of giving the facts, both this dvd and the other one, 10 Ways to Kill Bin Laden, both do the one but each with a different spin.  This one focuses on the brilliant nature of Bin Laden, how he always appears to be ahead of the game, whereas the other one, 10 Ways to Kill Bin Laden, focuses on U.S. efforts to try to kill Bin Laden and why the U.S. didn't succeed.  I think both dvds give valid points, but I think it's worth watching both dvds to get to the truth of the matter:  (1.  Bin Laden was brilliant but the U.S. was very successful in how they took over Afghanistan. (2.  Bin Laden dodged the U.S. very well, but there were several chances when the U.S. had the chance to kill or take out Bin Laden but chose not to do so because of the danger of killing people we did not want to kill.  Bin Laden had powerful friends that were considered allies to the U.S.  (3.  By not killing Bin Laden when it had the chance, the U.S. allowed 9/11 to happen though the U.S. had no idea that 9/11 would happen.  I personally think every American needs to watch dvds like this so they can avoid future 9/11 attacks in the future.  People like Bin Laden need to be studied, not because they are evil geniuses, but because people like him represent the real threat to America in the future and it's worth knowing to see what would work against a person like Bin Laden and what would not work.",1280707200,2,1939,4.259562841530054

Osama supplied money to those resisting the Soviets in Afghanistan, along with the Saudi Arabian government.  Jihadists were recruited for $300/month.  Billions went to the jihadists via Pakistan's ISI; it is also important to note the ISI didn't like Massoud because he didn't fit in with their post-invasion plans.

Bin Laden then built camps near the border with Pakistan for Arab fighters. Surrounded by the Soviets and attacked for nearly a week, Osama and his group mostly survived and became heroes in the Arab world.

Bin Laden became furious at the Saudi Arabian government for turning down his offer to repel Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and instead allowing infidels (U.S. and others) to occupy Saudi soil.  His preaching against the government led to his banishment and moving to Sudan.

Bin Laden undertook construction projects in Sudan, and again set up terrorist training camps.  Eventually the Sudanese offered to give him to Saudi Arabia (turned down - they feared a revolution if they acted against him), and then the U.S. (also turned down because our legal system had not yet built a ""sufficient case"" against bin Laden).

Bin Laden moved back to Afghanistan and threw in with the Taliban.  In the Spring of 1988 the CIA readied an attack on bin Laden using local commandos and electronic intercept information; this was scrapped by U.S. leaders fearing civilian casualties.  Bin Laden next bombed our embassies in Nairobi and Tanzania.  Bin Laden evaded retaliatory cruise missile strikes after being warned by the head of Pakistan's ISI.

President Clinton passed on another opportunity to get bin Laden while at a hunting trip - the concern was harming UAE leaders also in attendance.

Then came the U.S.S. Cole bombing, via Afghanistan's training camp veterans.  A CIA-supported effort by Massoud to kill bin Laden then failed.

Despite material on Ramzi Yousef's computer documenting plans to hijack an airplane and fly it into CIA headquarters, the CIA then failed to report the presence of two of the hijackers within the U.S., and the path is set for 9/11.

After the U.S. attack on Afghanistan, bin Laden called a meeting of tribal leaders in Jalabad, called (and paid) for their support, and then left in a convoy of 300-400 vehicles.  Interviews with an Arab who shared a cave with bin Laden in the Tora Bora area supports a conclusion that bin Laden had already left prior to the U.S. and warlord attack on Tora Bora.  At least one of the tribal leaders the U.S. was counting on had been coaxed over to bin Laden's side and failed to block any escapes.

No Al Qaeda or Taliban top leadership have defected as of this point, despite a multimillion price on his head.  Experts believe simply killing bin Laden would make him a martyr and lead to wide-spread suicide attacks - we must now capture him like Hussein.  Meanwhile, 20 of the 23 countries that supported the U.S. invasion of Iraq have been attacked by terrorists.",1224547200,2,3133,4.914448669201521
8224931,5,B000WP09PE,"This is one of the best documentaries I've seen on Osama Bin Laden and his rise to becoming a terrorist powerhouse, amidst the gross underestimation and mismanagement of US intelligence.  Filled with in-depth interviews from US and Middle Eastern intelligence and goverment operatives, it gives fantastic insight into who Osama Bin Laden is, and how he operates.  We can't fight this war in the future if don't understand how it was botched in the past, and how Bin Laden takes deliberate advantage of America's reluctance to fight, as this documentary brings into glaring clarity.  For instance, he knows Americans hate to see civilians killed, so he makes sure his henchmen hide among civilians so you can't attack them without hurting innocent people.  He's a master at turning American public opinion against itself, and destroying our will to do whatever it takes to defeat him.",1221091200,4,883,5.111111111111111
