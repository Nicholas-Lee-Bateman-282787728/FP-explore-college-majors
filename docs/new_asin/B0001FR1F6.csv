8011777,5,B0001FR1F6,"I might be letting extraneous considerations influence me here, but I think this was a production of a great opera that I can't imagine being better done.  Sure, I can imagine more glamorous vocal casting in the main male roles, but Guelfi (Boccanegra), La Scola (Adorno), and Konstantinov (Fiesco) are good singers with good (but not great) voices, and, most important, they know what these roles are about (thanks surely to the conductor, Abbado, and the director Peter Stein) and they can execute the concept.  Verdi usually poses personal fulfillment in tragic opposition to political reality (as in ""Aida,"" ""Don Carlos,"" and ""Ballo,"" for example), but here he seeks to unite the political and the personal in an enlarged and more gracious concept of politics -- ""Amor"" and ""Pace"" (love and peace) are the same thing in the languages of personal values and political values respectively.  Boccanegra dies a martyr to his belief in that more generous concept, but its main embodiment lives on in Amelia, the product of Simon's love for a woman from an ""enemy"" family.  The values that Simon speaks for in the Council Scene (""Ed io gridando 'Pace' . . ."" etc) are the values that we have seen Amelia ""teaching"" Adorno earlier in Act 1.

This 2002 performance must have been from the first Maggio Musicale Fiorentino production after the 9/11 bombings, and perhaps even the first for Abbado, following his diagnosis of cancer a year or so earlier.  He looks hauntingly frail here, and it's good to know that he had a dozen more years of productive life ahead of him -- but one can't help wondering if the decision to put on ""Boccanegra"" was a consequence of these personal and political considerations.  The Florence May Festival, one assumes, does not have the deep pockets of La Scala or the Met, and so there is only one indubitably great voice in the cast -- that of Karita Mattila, whose assumption of the role of Amelia is a triumph.  Good as de los Angeles and Freni are in studio recordings, they just can't match the intensity and amplitude of Mattila's vocalism, and her acting is an object-lesson in economical, expressive stage-movement.  She gets the fancy gowns, and given her thematic centrality as the embodiment of the core values of the piece, she is often, strikingly, in the center of the stage picture too, as she should be, given this conception.  Otherwise, the sets are functional and the costuming muted (apart from Paolo's orange jump-suit!).

Hearing Guelfi at first, one is aware of a quite soft baritone, with a nice quality, but one wonders if he can rise to authority in the council Scene and the few other places that require it.  Suffice it to say that he does -- to his credit, he knows his voice and knows how to get out of it what the dramatic situation requires.  When in Act 3 what is required are the tired tones of the dying Doge, his voice is a perfect fit, and the whole final Act is very movingly done, with Abbado conducting unobtrusively but surely to give a feeling that what we have here is something that wouldn't be out of place in a requiem.  The sense of movement, music, and utterance coming together in the final Act is as moving as anything I've seen, live or on film, from the operatic stage.  La Scola too distinguishes himself -- he has a pleasant tenor that isn't particularly distinctive in timbre or in size, but like Guelfi he knows what's needed.  His Act 2 aria (""Sento avvampar . . . . Cielo, pietoso rendila . . ."") is very well done indeed; his teacher, Carlo Bergonzi, would be proud of him.  It's a tricky piece, and Abbado paces it helpfully for his singer, and the result is powerful.  The bass Julian Konstantinov gets better as Fiesco as the opera goes on, the voice perhaps loosening up more slowly than the others.  My only quibble is that he always looks like a young singer playing an old man -- but his final scene with Guelfi is movingly done.  Lucio Gallo, the Paolo, is in fine voice -- it seems a bigger instrument than Guelfi's.  Paolo, of course, is the spokesman for a totally cynical politics -- for him, honor can't be separated from power and wealth.  That is madness in terms of Amelia's and Boccanegra's values -- and Gallo plays Paolo as a madman here.  The facial expressions, the bugging eyes, the orange jumpsuit -- and he's mad because he can't make sense of what Simon has become, a leader who sees himself as a servant of the people.  It's a striking concept, and Gallo's performance might strike some as overdone, but it seems to me consonant with Stein's overall humane conception.  So . . . I might see other convincing interpretations of this score, but I can't think that they'll be any more moving and clearly-focused than this one.  It's unforgettable, and Abbado's conducting and Mattila's singing are out of this world.",1421280000,2,4825,4.673758865248227
8011778,5,B0001FR1F6,"This is an outstanding recording of Simon Boccanegra. The only thing that bothered me slightly was the last scene, which is normally in the doge's chamber, was moved to a beach for no obvious reason. The singing, conducting, and acting was excellent.",1139011200,5,250,4.976190476190476
8011779,5,B0001FR1F6,"This is surely the most beautiful, touching and carefully thought out recording of this opera ever made.  Claudio Abbado does marvels with the orchestra--romantic intensity at its peak. Mattila's voice is ethereal, La Scola's heartfelt singing reminds one of the young Carreras, Guelfi is a soft-toned but immensely affecting Simon, Konstantinov is adequate but does not equal his predecessors.  The production is stark (except for a more detailed council chamber scene), the colors (predominantly red and blue) are strong and effective, the filming is excellent, intimate but also distant when necessary.  Altogether a tremendously moving account of a very powerful opera.  Verdi at his melodic and emotional best.",1120953600,21,715,5.592592592592593
8011780,2,B0001FR1F6,"Kariti Mattila is indeed stunning as Amelia Grimaldi.  La Scola's bumbling, eager, and erratic Gabriel is thoroughly appropriate for the operatic character (and for the historical one as well).  Jacopo Fiesco and Paolo Albiani are both well-played.  But Paolo, a mere henchman, dwarfs Carlo Guelfi's Simon. Simon Boccanegra, in the opera as in history, was a forceful and decisive leader.  Guelfi's failing voice and hesitant acting reduce the central character to a bewildered and tired old man. The costumes are dull and historically inaccurate.",1106352000,8,547,5.476190476190476
8011781,2,B0001FR1F6,"I have to respectfully disagree with the previous reviewer. I agree that Abbado gives the score of Boccanegra a bit of oomph, something it needs for it to 'sell.' But the principals, excepting Karita Mattila, and the production are bush-league. At times I thought I was watching silent moving acting, or members of the football team acting the annual school play. And the singing is merely serviceable. That includes all the male principals. When Mattila as Amelia appears, though, the stage lights up. That, unfortunately, is not enough to save the whole enterprise. Now, if we could just get Mattila on DVD as Salome!",1081900800,7,619,4.961538461538462
8011782,5,B0001FR1F6,"This performance is what opera is about.  It just does not get any better than this when it comes to opera--sublime Verdi, fabulous production, the best (in my opinion)Verdi conductor in the whole world, extraordinary cast of singers.  This is opera at its glorious best!
If you want to see and hear how exciting opera can be, buy this disc!",1081555200,10,341,4.666666666666667
