8297341,5,B001EAYH3Q,"The Richard Quick series is the best I've seen for improving swimmers' times.  They're very easy to understand with exceptionally effective drills.  I think Richard Quick was one of the greatest swim coaches of all time.  He made an entry level series which is great for younger swimmers, but honestly high school swimmers would benefit too.  This video was a part of the second series for older swimmers.  If you have a beginner swimmer, start them with the freestyle video where Coach Quick talks about ""posture, line & balance.""  These concepts improve a beginner swimmer's performance overnight!",1496102400,,599,5.123711340206185
