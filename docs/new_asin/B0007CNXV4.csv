2208790,5,B0007CNXV4,I first saw this film in the '60s and was glad to have it again. Excellent DVD.,1154822400,6,79,3.7058823529411766
2208791,4,B0007CNXV4,"Allowing for the albeit distracting 1968-isms (i.e. leather mini skirts and Beatles-style haircuts) this is a first rate version of Shakespeare's magical play.  Featuring a cast of amazing stars including Helen Mirren and Diana Rigg as Hermia and Helena, Judy Dench (quite scantily clad) as Titania, the velvet-voiced Ian Richardson as Oberon and the impish Iam Holm as Puck, this version successfully portrays the combination of humor, magic and the  absurdities of young love (""Lord, what fools these mortals be!"") inherent in Shakespeare's play.  The high-speed camera work and overabundance of green face paint can be a bit distracting, but the brilliance of Bottom and the ""rude mechanicals"", the careful balancing of the magical and the real and the faithful and articulate delivery of Shakespeare's gorgeous language more than compensate for any eccentricities of film-craft.  Listening to Oberon's beautiful soliloquies (""I know a bank where the wild thyme blows..."") delivered with such beauty and grace by Ian Richardson is worth the price of admission all by itself! Give Peter Hall's MND a try!",1153785600,23,1106,5.375722543352601
2208792,5,B0007CNXV4,"The film source materials start off looking battered, but the image cleans up pretty quickly.

More importantly, the performances are uniformly strong, without a weak link to be found. If you are familiar with Ian Richardson and Judy Dench only from their recent work, this movie will be an eye-opener. Bill Travers' Snout is a treasure, and Paul Rogers leaves behind his usual kings and bullies to give a vocally astonishing performance as Bottom.

Most productions of this play have trouble balancing the scenes of the confused lovers in the forest with the Pyramis and Thisbe farce at the end - usually one or the other gets out of control, but this one gets it right for once. There is a little self-conscious film editing a la Richard Lester and the New Wave that has dated, but doesn't really kill the occasion. The language and atmosphere are magical, as good as it gets.

Some of the whining in these reviews is silly. There is no other Midsummer Night's Dream so evenly and superlatively cast, and it's worth putting up with less than optimal print quality to watch and listen to them.",1146096000,52,1094,4.717277486910994
2208793,3,B0007CNXV4,"it sounds like they did a pretty crummy job transferring this film to dvd but i must put two cents in for the film itself. i think all the actors are wonderful and the trippy look and feel are appropriate and fun. the production of the play by Nick Bottom and the 'rude mechanicals' is laugh-out-loud funny. very much worth seeing, in my opinion. plus it features the young and lovely helen mirren, the young, lovely and naked judi dench, miss peel from The Avengers and the guy who gets his head cut off in The Omen. i give the film 4 stars, subtracting one for the poor quality of the transfer (that i've read about).",1144627200,9,619,4.344827586206897
2208794,4,B0007CNXV4,"Although the scratchy unrestored color makes this DVD it look as if it had been pirated in a movie theatre thirty years ago, it is well worth buying if only to see the delightful performances of young Helen Mirren as Hermia, Diana Rigg (taking a break from Emma Peel) as Helena, Judy Dench as Titania, Ian Richardson (who gives a preview of his ""House of Cards"" sardonic smile) as Oberon, and even the husband of Hyacinth Bucket (pronounced Bouquet) as Snug the Joiner. The production (with its pink-lipped green fairies and hairy-chested Puck) may have been misguided, but the actors shine as future stars of British stage and cinema.

Because of the poor quality and the faded print, I'd actually give it three and 1/2 stars. I still recommend it, however, as a piece of historical interest.",1116374400,68,793,4.788321167883212
2208795,1,B0007CNXV4,"1 Star for the DVD, 2 for the director, 3 for the cast: I originally saw this for a Shakespeare in film class at U.C. Berkeley 20 years ago, and it's a ashamed that copy wasn't borrowed for this transfer. But even a clean copy wouldn't help this poorly edited ""art"" film. Hall was definitely trying to aspire to arty French and Italian films of the time, but it doesn't work. As for the acting, the women are great - the men cardboard. Helen Mirren's first major film role as Hermia is fun to watch as is Diana Rigg's Helena. It's also pretty fun to see a 35-year-old Judi Dench as the bare-breasted Titania. Ian Holm is way over the top as Puck and a future playing villians is apparent when you see David Warner's attempt as the fair hero and lover. Mirren's second romp in the forest as Titania in the 1981 BBC production is far superior. Buy that one, then rent this to compare the two for fun.",1113436800,21,898,4.288235294117647
2208796,1,B0007CNXV4,"Could Water Bearer Films have found a print in worse condition?  With weaker, more faded color?  There is a note on the back cover that the ""Digital color enhancement"" has been copyrighted - that's enhancement?  And on top of it all it looks like a poor copy of a VHS tape.  The wretched quality of the picture... and the sound as well... make the DVD virtually unwatchable.  A 1968 film shouldn't look as bad as this.  I guess we're just supposed to be grateful that the film is available on DVD - thanks, but no thanks, Water Bearer.",1111795200,46,535,4.408163265306122

2208799,5,B0007CNXV4,"This review regards the 2011 MGM DVD release of the film.  I saw this production when it first came out in 1969 and also saw it as a film a few years later.  It remains one of my all time favorites.  I had the terrible video cassette release of this, and I suspect the first DVD version was little better.  The MGM version is really quite good and looks great on a big screen TV.  It also fits perfectly on the 16:9 format.  As for the performance itself, this is the cream of the British crop in their prime.  Helen Mirren was 22 or 23 and is barely recognizable as Hermia.  Diana Rigg at 30 was coming off the Avengers.  Both the women are quite funny.  You will never feel the same about Judy Dench after seeing her in this film!  Ian Richardson's Oberon is perhaps the best of the many stellar performances, right up near the top.  Ian Holm's Puck takes a little getting used to, but he is a good trickster in a rather non-human fairy sort of way!  You'll never find a funnier bunch of mechanicals than this set, and their play of Pyramus and Thisby at the end is very funny.  More than anything, though, you get all the poetry of Shakespeare's lines.  This version is mostly uncut, and the dialogue is beautiful spoken.  This is one of Shakespeare's most poetic plays, and this production evokes all its magic.  Sure, the costumes are somewhat silly, some of the effects work better than others, but this is a classic version of the play well-captured for posterity.  Personally, too, I like green fairies!",1456358400,,1511,4.432727272727273

2208802,1,B0007CNXV4,"A very bizarre presentation of MSND, but one of the few I can show in the classroom at school.  There is one questionable scene that clearly outlines the sexual innuendo of intimacy between Queen Titania and Bottom.  (I censor this part with a folder in front of my data projector lens.)

2208805,5,B0007CNXV4,"I'm writing reviews on facebook about the best version of each of Shakespeare's plays.  Here is the first.

The earliest William Shakespeare play, by historical chronology, is A Midsummer Night's Dream. There are two versions available on DVD, with a third coming from the Globe Theater in about a month. My favorite by far is Peter Hall and The Royal Shakespeare Company, with David Warner, Helen Mirren, Ian Richardson, Ian Holm, Judi Dench, and Diana Rigg. It is all moonshine and fairy dust, a charming adaptation. The other is a more modern version starring Kevin Klein and Michelle Pfeiffer, where you get to see Bottom and Titania copulate silhouetted against a full moon. The third version I'll review here when it appears.",1433548800,,731,4.983606557377049
2208806,5,B0007CNXV4,"The Amazon HD edition is a dazzlingly beautiful digital transfer with superior sound.

Visually stunning, impeccably acted adaptation.",1432944000,2,267,6.444444444444445
2208807,5,B0007CNXV4,"This simply stellar cast more than compensates for the quality of this dvd.  Those who wanted glossy special effects and modern visual quality should not have bought a 1968 production.  This Royal Shakespeare Company performance  almost resembles a stage play which, for me, is the best way to see the Bard's works.
  I've seen other versions of this hilarious comedy but this is my favourite.",1423353600,3,393,4.984615384615385

For example as you can see from the cast list, Diana Rigg, Judy Dench, and Ian Holm do not appear in this 1981 production. (Rather, they appear in the 1969 film directed by Peter Hall.)  Helen Mirren does appear in this 1981 BBC film, but as Titania, not as one of the young lovers. Phil Daniels plays a delightful Puck, and Peter McEnery is Oberon.  In any case, the 1981 BBC film is my favorite one of the Dream, and I highly recommend it. Just thought I'd try to clear up this strange confusion. Either the downloadable film on this page is misrepresented, or reviews of the 1969 film are for some reason posted on this page advertising the 1981 film.",1413936000,13,828,4.434210526315789

My husband likes to read the subtitles so he can catch the words since English was not his first language.

2208821,4,B0007CNXV4,"Director Peter Hall breathed new life into Shakespearean theatre when he founded the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1960.  One of the company's most innovative productions was A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM, and when it proved successful Hall took a crack at a film version.  While the 1968 film did not duplicate the effects that made the Hall stage version so popular, it was very well liked by critics and Shakespearean fans alike.

Unfortunately, the film is presently in near-unwatchable condition.  It would be impossible to count the number of artifacts in each scene: blips, dots, scratches, streaks, and the occasional hair are endless.  The color is also washed out, and at times the film looks more like a black and white movie than a color one.  The sound elements aren't much better, so get ready to fiddle with the volume from scene to scene.  But if you're prepared to put with all that, you'll find a memorable production of DREAM hidden beneath.

The production is very much of its time.  Hall pushes the actors for speed, and they toss off the complex lines at remarkable tempo, often with numerous cuts in the scenes, occasionally speaking directly to the camera.  Hairstyles are distinctly of the 1960s and so too are most of the costumes, with many of the actresses stomping around in mini-skirts and go-go boots to unexpected effect.  The fairies are of particular note: instead of the usual gossamer creatures, they are presented as wild, slightly raw earth spirits.  All of this might seem a bit much, but it is really a breath of fresh air for a play that tends to receive an excessively arty treatment. Helen Mirren, David Warner, Diana Rigg, and Ian Holm (to name the most obvious) give charming performances.  My own favorite among the cast is Judy Dench, who gives an astonishing performance as Titania.  The biggest complaint one can make about any performance is that occasionally the actors speak so rapidly they become a bit difficult to follow.

There are no DVD bonuses of any kind, and the film condition is frightful, but this indeed a film most fans of Shakespeare's comedy will find truly enjoyable.  Recommended.

2208822,5,B0007CNXV4,"Most actors and actresses in this film went on to major acting careers. Ian Richardson's Oberon is as much a joy as is Judy Dench's Titania. The big surprise to me in this film was that Paul Rogers as Bottom (who is turned into a donkey) is the best I've ever seen. Unbelievable: Not just funny, but sweet and charming. His use of his eyes through the donkey's mask is a study in how to use one's human assets. Ian Holm's Puck makes terrific use of very rapid speech combined with the simple special effects used: Totally unexpected as he became a world-known serious actor. I simply love this production.",1375228800,7,605,4.509090909090909

Several years ago I bought a VHS copy of this, and unfortunately, it was a long blur.

This current DVD issue is reasonably sharp, and the production is still good. I was at a Shakespeare Festival production of Midsummer Night's Dream a few weeks ago, which was very good, which had Titania more modestly clothed.

The production and acting is commendable, and for the fans of Shakespeare, I highly recommend. It holds up very well, even after 47 years.",1372118400,7,618,4.651376146788991

This edition is played fairly straight -- there's a woods set, as well as Theseus' hall -- and in Elizabethan garb.  The acting is decent enough, if early on a bit wooden -- Titania, Bottom, Quince, Puck, and the four lovers shine through best.  Whenever the play shifts to Puck's action scenes, it gets a bit too artsy to follow well, and the nicely mischievous Puck sometimes speaks a wee bit to fast to follow -- but overall it's a reasonably well-done edition of this Shakespearean comedy.",1371168000,,708,4.739837398373984
2208826,3,B0007CNXV4,"I have seen five films of Shakespeare's ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"", and none of them are ""perfect"". Each seems to do something better than the others. It should be no surprise that everyone does the scenes with the ""Mechanicals"" pretty well. In part that's because the character, Bottom has more lines than any other role. In general, the headline actor of each production is the one who plays Bottom, as with the 1935 Hollywood production starring James Cagney and the 1999 Hollywood production starring Kevin Kline. In this production, Bottom is played by a RSC regular, Paul Rogers, surrounded by a lot of young actors who would later become quite famous, such as Helen Mirren, Judi Dench, Diana Rigg, Ian Holm, Ian Richardson, and David Warner. I am not overly fond of Rogers' interpretation of Bottom, and I definitely do not like the lame implementation of his ass's head. In the 1935 production with James Cagney, they did a much better job. Even better was the minimalist interpretation done for Kevin Kline.

The second most important character would seem to be Puck / Robin Goodfellow. Here again, I think the 1935 Hollywood version did better with a very young Mickey Rooney. The 1999 version also tended to take a ""minimalist"" approach with the much older Stanley Tucci. Much stands and falls on how well the production does the four couples. In this production, I found Michael Jayston and David Warner as Demetrius and Lysander to be quite wooden. Their girls were better, but then, that is usually the case. The girls parts are better done than the boys.

The older Athenians in this production were uninspired, but then, that is not where the real action is happening. Oberon and Titania, by Ian Richardson and Judi Dench were well done, but the fairy scenes suffered from being done without the gargantuan Hollywood budgets. Lets face it, this play is a great fantasy, and great effects do help.

The director seemed to take a lot of liberties with the Bottom and Titania scenes, and I'm not sure they work as well as in other films. The interaction between Puck and Oberon is fair to good, although Holm's interpretation of Puck is better fitted to be done by a very young Puck, like Mickey Rooney. Stanley Tucci does an older Puck much better.

I'm unsure of Barbara Jeffords's performance as Hippolyta. It must not have been memorable, since it did not stick in my memory; however, she has a brilliant career as a Shakespearian actor.

On balance, I would put this production in the lower third of all filming of the play, because it does not have the best ""Mechanicals"" scenes. Unfortunately, no film of the play seems perfect. Each seems to emphasize a certain aspect, and not do justice to other aspects.

I wish the play were filmed the way it might have been seen in the Globe, with minimal scenery and effects. The only problem with that is that it may exaggerate actors' business to the point of parody. But, we wait the next attempt.",1371168000,,2962,4.752918287937743

My review of the 20C Fox and MGM 2011 print is below.

The Twentieth Century Fox and MGM's 2011 release of Peter Hall's 1968 film adaptation of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" is a perfectly good print of this splendidly performed and clearly enunciated play. This is the print to obtain not the other poor copies issued earlier and much complained about on Amazon film reviews.

A host of Britain's finest actors from the last quarter of the twentieth century are shown here performing in the (near) nakedness of their (relative) youth from Judi Dench, Helen Mirren and Diana Rigg to Ian Richardson, Ian Holm and many more! They speak and act the text clearly, and the camera angles apart from a bit of camera tricky favour the faces and the viewer's right to hear the text properly.

The only significant flaw worth mentioning is the lamentable lack of subtitles, essential in all Shakespeare films.

Find the very fun 1968 RSC film version directed by Peter Hall (also with Mirren, but this time as Hermia) and see that instead.

Beware:  Several reviews here of this version are from reviewers who didn't watch it, but saw Mirren's name, and assumed it to be their beloved 1968 RSC production.  It's not.",1359590400,2,532,4.5473684210526315

I find the 1969 version suffers from being too clever.  And the quality of the film is awful, as most reviewers state.

But I love this production of ""Midsummer Night's Dream""!  First of all, the quality of the film is much better than 1969.  Second, the producer and director aren't trying to be clever, they produce a straightforward play, shot in a studio, not in the woods.  Next, they are highly respectful of Shakespeare's words.  Finally, there are some wonderful actors in important roles:  Helen Mirren as Titania for a start, then Geoffrey Palmer as Peter Quince (his deadpan face perfect for the role) and Brian Glover as Bottom.  What could be better! Even the lesser known actors produce fine work.  I especially like how the scenes of bickering among the two couples is handled.  It sounds like a real fight, not people reading lines.  I also love the 17th-century setting, which is very well done and very close to contemporary with Shakespeare's own time.

Unfortunately, as others have noted by others here, the quality of this reproduction of that performance is abysmal.  Absolutely abysmal.  THe color is uneven and faded, and the sound uneven as well.  It is most unfortunate that this fine production by a sterling cast should be so degraded in this edition.  This is a movie which really is in want and need of a proper treatment.

  This version is not such a treatment.",1309737600,3,492,4.773809523809524

Some viewers find fault with the visuals, but I find great humor in them. Peter Hall's editorial experimentation and the 1960's fashion sense make for lively imagery.

The film quality is imperfectly preserved, but what of that? In no way difficult to view. My favorite version, all five blazing stars.",1309392000,4,418,5.057971014492754

It is also true that the costume department had an off day, and that the filming does not escape from its origins as a stage play. Overcome all this and you get by far the strongest and funniest performance of the Dream that I've seen on film or on stage (and I've seen a few). The mechanical's play in particular is hilarious. These are not stars doing a bit of culture on the side, but the Royal Shakespeare Company's best young actors from an exceptionally talented generation. Diana Rigg, for example, was playing Cordelia at Stratford before she was Emma Peel.",1300579200,,681,4.456

the script much: all the rich language of the Bard!

I am delighted to have it for use in my 8th grade honors literature class, as it is superior to most modern versions of Shakespeare's play that I have seen.  The Kevin Kline version, for example, is inappropriate for my use in an 8th grade classroom, although it would probably be fine for high school students.",1271116800,6,426,4.592105263157895

I can't show it in class, but there is nothing more satisfying than seeing young Dame Judy brazen and lovely enough to pull off a nude Titania and seeing the lovely, elegant woman she is now.  This is also the only version I have seen, so far, that portrays Hippolyta as the strong, amazon she is supposed to be!  Hurrah for the brits, who don't have any problem keeping the complexity of the relationship between Theseus and Hippolyta!  The trappings of the sixties just made it more of a romp!  I would really rent this, the quality is absolutely terrible.  I am sure I have caught snippets of a much better copy on television at some point, if I had known what a must see it was, I would have recorded it then.

2208844,3,B0007CNXV4,"I love Shakespeare's work in most of its incarnations.  This version of A Midsummer Night's Dream was purchased to show at a retirement community to celebrate the summer solstice - there were several to pick from and this one with a very young Judi Dench and Helen Mirren seemed the most worthy.  I was disappointed on first glimpse at the poor color quality and the dated costuming which was based on the late-60s / early 70s style.  Men had Beatles type bowl haircuts, women wore thigh-high black boots and mini skirts.  That was my era - it's a dated look now.

The second disappiontment was the too-rapid delivery of the lines combined with very little expressive body gesture.  It seemed the performers proffered the canto without wanting to impose their personas on the sacred words.  Actually, it is the inhabiting of the character by the actor that brings Shakespeare to life.  He did write for common folk, not exclusively for elitists, so overt physical gestures make sense.  I wanted to see the actors really become those folks in the play.

Compare with a recent version starring David Straitharn, Stanley Tucci, Calista Flockhart, Michelle Pfeiffer and others.  They really flesh out the physicality of their parts, and are believable despite the far-fetched nature of the story.  That was the well-received version I showed to my seniors.

I did not finish watching this one - it was just too wooden.
Still, you do get to see a naked Judi Dench - which did not save it; on the contrary, that little touch was completely unnecessary and only distracted.  I give it a C.",1184803200,6,1582,4.789667896678967
2208845,4,B0007CNXV4,"I first saw this film in 16mm format when I was taking Shakespeare in college in 1980. I liked it so much that every year after I would find out when the class was showing it just to go see it. The film's image onscreen was  always rich, lush, and filled with color. At the time aside from Diana Rigg and a couple of others, I didn't know who many of the actors were. Now, looking back 27 years later after many of them like Judy Dench and Helen Mirren have had such distinguished careers, it is really amazing to look back on it now and see them when they were so young etc.

The reason I bought the dvd was because it's the only way I can go back and see it now. Having seen a real film print in excellent condition, I can verify that unfortunately as one other reviewer said, the print is washed out and the colors faded, and while the overall image is clean, the film's imperfections are apparent. The whole thing could benefit from a better print and digital remastering. If you're just looking for a film version of this play, then you may be better off with more recent releases. However if you can get past the imperfections and have a keen interest, then it's a great way to look back in time at many of these fine British actors.",1174089600,8,1239,4.223628691983122
2208846,4,B0007CNXV4,"I had this film on video and the transfer was horrible.

Yes, the dialogue is read faster than the cast of the original horror flick THE THING could've done it, the green makeup of the fairies comes and goes like sunscreen...but this film is worth seeing for the cast alone.

Diana Rigg is as sexy as she ever was as Mrs. Emma Peel from ""The Avengers"" or Mrs. James Bond in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE.

Judi Dench, who would become 007's boss ""M"" in the Pierce Brosnan Bond films, runs around in green paint and pasties.  If the crew of the Enterprise had beamed down into this production, Captain Kirk would've added another hot green chick to his list of conquests (alongside Yvonne Craig).

David Warner, an actor whose career goes from THE OMEN to TIME BANDITS to TRON to TITANIC, plays one of the ""human"" leads.

Helen Mirren looks like she just got out of high school--so young and fresh and pretty!  She would go on to many sexy roles.  One of the weirdest ones was THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE & HER LOVER.

And Ian Holm, perhaps best remembered as the milk-sweating android from the original ALIEN, plays a hyper, twitching fairy.  He was also great in THE SWEET HEREAFTER and in the Mel Gibson version of HAMLET.

Any one of these actors would've been worth watching in a Shakespearean production...but to have them all?

Definitely worth watching.",1155772800,21,1364,4.590909090909091

Yes, the quality of the original film stock is pretty bad, especially in the beginning - I'm surprised no one has found original film elements in better shape since 1968 - but I'm guessing this was originally a production for BBC television and knowing how they either chucked out or recorded over other productions from that era (Dr. Who for instance) I'm not surprised. Everyone's performance is dynamic, the pacing is perfect and Shakespeare's English bubbles and flows at you like a thrilling raft ride.

8046837,5,B0007CNXV4,"An independent film Directed by Peter Hall and The Royal Shakespeare Company, Stratford-upon-Avon. This is one of those gems that allow many famous personalities of the time to display a little culture.

There are many fun facets of this film; right off we notice all the actors in a much earlier version. Who would have thought that Judi Dench was once so cute? And Helen Mirren before she was queen. Each version of midsummer Night's Dream displays a different star cast; and also to our advantage displays a different emphasis and dialog of William Shakespeare.

Then there is the negative side. Look closely and it looks like an Italian film with English dubbing; the words and voices are not quite in sync. The cameraman is the one that filmed ""The Blare Witch.""

Believe it or not it is better the second time through.

However the spoken speech was very clear and some of the best elocution of the text that I have heard on DVD or live.  Many of the actors in this DVD went on to very distinguished careers on stage and screen.

8046840,5,B0007CNXV4,"Let's get the little problems out of the way. Color is iffy, and it looks like a stage play earnestly trying to be a movie - not a movie born and bred. Well, fine.

That aside, this offers striking performances by a cast of stars, rising and risen, including Judi Dench, Helen Mirren, and Diana Rigg as they were almost 40 before this writing. It might be hard to believe they were ever that young (or Dame Judi that daring), but their mature skill and delivery are certainly there. After a while, I stopped seeing the technical maculae and just enjoyed their wonderful presentation.
