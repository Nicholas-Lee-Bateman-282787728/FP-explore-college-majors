Never showed ot to my students because it is just not ""cool"" enough. I am sure if this documentary was redone by NOVA today it would be significantly better. If you are looking for short impressive footage you will have more luck on the internet.",1169078400,,370,4.3
8179186,5,6304463235,"I've seen a number of tornado documentaries and have to say this one is the best I've seen. You get wrapped up in the storyline as the scientists and interns from the National Severe Storms Laboratory plan their chase.

 Unlike other documentaries that are slapped together with some footage to try and sell you something, you immediately sense how genuine these scientists are. You can tell how passionate and sincere they are about their fascination with severe storms (tornadoes) ... This one is a keeper, one you'll want to watch several times.",1115683200,3,548,4.945652173913044
