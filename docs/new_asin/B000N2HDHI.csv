ALONE WITH HER is a story about Amy, a beautiful, young woman (Ana Claudia Talancon) who is stalked by a seemingly mild-mannered man named Doug (Colin Hanks from 11:14). Doug utilizes the latest in highly effective, inexpensive surveillance equipment in order to see and hear his victim's every private moment. We are witnesses to the crimes that Doug commits, unable to warn Amy or her doomed friend (Jordana Spiro) in any way.

If for no other reason when you watch this movie,it shows how easily it is to become the object of someones obsession and never know it. Also be sure to watch the alternate ending if you want to see a more Hollywood ending.",1203120000,,366,4.397058823529412
2752774,3,B000N2HDHI,"Awhile ago, I had to watch a documentary based on the Crumb brothers, 3 artist/painter brothers with incredibly odd and bizarre personalities. One of them, Robert, responsible for the ""keep on truckin'"" and the comics of Fritz the Cat, is probably the most mature and seemingly intelligent of the 3 yet he's got abnormal views on racism and sexuality. The male character in this film is the same way: he's quite intelligent, he's friendly and there's nothing really off-putting about him...except you know, he's kind of crazy.

Shot entirely using small cameras, we follow Doug (Colin Hanks), a lonely kid who one day sees Amy (Ana Claudia Talancon) in a park. He becomes smitten yet he goes about it the wrong way: buys small cameras that are to be hidden around her house such as her bathroom, living room and bedroom. He then slowly gets into her life: rents a movie that she just watches, music that's rather obscure. But just because a guy is nice doesn't mean a girl will like you and he becomes a bit jealous and isn't above doing anything wrong to ""teach her a lesson"". Now it's just a case of how long until Amy figures it out.

There's a certain depraved quality when you're watching this movie, almost as if there's scenes that make you see things differently than what's on screen. Talancon for example, goes naked a couple times and normally this would be titilation but here, it's almost creepy and you almost hope you don't get turned on. But the big question is how believable does it feel and at times, depending on your view, this can stretch credibility. When he knows the specific movie and music she listens to and even conveniently calls when an accident happens, you kind of wonder how naive she is, or whether how trusting we all are.

The film is by and large a 2 character study and luckily we have 2 actors that pull it off well. Which is surprising considering they're not really flashy roles, there's no ""Oscar moment"" but it's that sense of normalcy and realistic that makes it more plausible. Initially I was worried about Colin Hanks since he's always been a more meek, mouse-y kind of guy in movies but here he's inviting but with a degree of weirdness. Playing the attractive sex bomb, Talancon is sympathetic although at times you kind of wonder how completely trusting she is since most girls I know would've been like ""how the hell did you know that movie?""

It's the kind of film that's it best to watch once. There's not a lot to bring you back in; sure it's unique looking but it's also slightly hollow and wouldn't benefit from repeat viewings. Now let me go debug my room.",1183680000,28,2614,4.603004291845494
2752775,3,B000N2HDHI,"***1/2

Eric Nicholas` ""Alone With Her"" starts off with a rather alarming Department of Justice statement that every minute three new people become victims of stalkers, and that, thanks to modern technology, even your garden-variety voyeur, who used to be restricted to what he could see by aiming a pair of high-powered binoculars into the neighbor`s window, now has access to high-tech devices, once the sole province of the CIA and the FBI, to help him with his peeping.  Through its innovative, you-are-there style, this low-budget, independent thriller really drives that message home.

The stalker in this case is a young man named Doug, a techno-savvy misfit with extreme sociopathic tendencies, who through an elaborate network of hidden microphones and cameras, has found a way to keep the object of his obsession - a beautiful young woman named Amy -  under surveillance literally 24 hours a day without her knowledge.  Slowly but surely, he worms his way into her life, manipulating her emotions and earning her trust along the way.

In form as well as in style, ""Alone With Her"" is a cross between ""Peeping Tom"" and ""The Blair Witch Project,"" with the audience viewing the action entirely through the lenses of Doug's strategically placed cameras.  This innovative technique effectively puts us in the shoes of the voyeuristic stalker, making us, in some strange way, complicit in his actions - and isn't all moviewatching, when you get right down to it, just another form of voyeurism?  The real chill, of course, comes from the realization of just how easy modern technology has made it for our rights of personal space and privacy to be violated.  If this movie doesn't turn you into a raving paranoiac, nothing will.

""Alone With Her"" is more than just a mere exercise in style, however.  Thanks to compelling performances from Ana Claudia Talancon, Colin Hanks (who appears off-screen for most of the film) and Jordana Spiro, the movie emerges as an engrossing human drama as well, one that makes us empathize with the various characters whose story we are being compelled to watch.  For beyond the threat posed by all the technical hardware, the film unnervingly points out the risk we all take by simply opening ourselves up to friendships and relationships with people we actually know very little about.

Some people may find ""Alone With Her"" too low-keyed in its approach to be truly frightening.  However, it is just that lack of sensationalism that makes it so convincing in its creepiness.  It's true that the movie, like many thrillers, falls apart somewhat in its third act due to its budgetary constraints as well as a certain predictability in the plotting. Still, ""Alone With Her"" illustrates the truth of Marshall McLuhan's observation that ""the medium is the message"" better than any film of recent times.",1183507200,14,2837,5.006382978723404
2752776,4,B000N2HDHI,"**SPOILERS**

This movie chronicles a dysfunctional loner's (""Doug"" played by Colin Hanks) voyeuristic obsession with a beautiful young woman (""Amy""), played by the interesting Ana Talancon. Basically, he commits a B&E and sets up hidden video cameras in her apartment. With the information he obtains from watching and listening to her, he is able to insinuate himself in her life.

Thumbs up to Tom Hanks' son for picking unique material like this. He does an excellent job playing the socially inept stalker, esp. when you consider it's probably 180 degrees from his real life.

What stands out about this movie is its verisimilitude, even in this age of reality TV. I thought the writer (Eric Nicholas) had a good grasp for the way things play out in real life. For instance, the scene with Doug and Amy's friend on the stairs right before he kills her was just spot on. She didn't over do it with seeming freaked out, but clearly she was unnerved by his sudden appearance on the scene. And the way she conveyed that just rang true.

Finally, the ending. Wow. I don't think audiences are ready for something that realistic and dark, but we'll see.

Overall, well worth watching. I love movies like this with a unique point of view.",1179014400,17,1235,4.752336448598131

2752784,4,B000N2HDHI,"Writer/director Eric Nicolas's Alone With Her (2007) is an absorbing tale of obsession, as a perverted stalker uses hidden cameras to gain information, and begin a relationship with a young woman.  The film's intriguing premise is that what is shown on screen, consists almost entirely of video from various concealed sources, pieced together to form a story that is chilling, and disturbingly realistic.  Ana Claudia Talancon gives a fantastic performance in her debut in an English speaking film, as a woman who becomes the victim in a cruel manipulation.

Doug (Colin Hanks) is a lonely, social dysfunctional guy, who sells college textbooks for a living, and gets his kicks shooting surreptitious video of women. While at a park, he spots a woman named Amy (Talancon) with her dog, and follows her home.  After obtaining some miniature cameras, Doug gets into Amy's apartment, and plants them throughout the living room and bathroom.  Using information that he gleans from watching the woman, Doug gains the confidence to strike up a casual relationship, which gradually becomes more involved, as Doug becomes more ingenious and proactive.

Amy is an artist, who paints and does sculpture in her free time, and is very impressed when Doug builds a website for her.  Doug's twisted plan seems to be working well, until Matt (Jonathan Trent), Amy's coworker begins to date her, enraging the stalker who watches them on a monitor in his apartment.  Doug takes stronger, more punitive measures to retake control of the situation, entering Amy's apartment, and applying a skin irritant to her bed sheets.  After putting her relationship on hold, Doug steals Amy's laptop, which causes her to lose her job.  When Amy is injured in a not so accidental ""accident"", it is Doug that she turns to for help.

Throughout the film, much information is communicated to the audience, when Amy confides in her friend Jen (Jordana Spiro), who provides support and advice to Amy.  When Jen unexpectedly drops by Amy's place, Doug's well laid plans are again disturbed, particularly as a suspicious Jen catches him telling some lies.  Unfortunately, Doug has an unpleasant way of removing whatever gets in his way.

Supposedly utilizing various surreptitious video, Alone With Her With has a rather unique look, and draws you into a very intimate situation, where we see Amy with virtually all of her barriers down, totally unaware, completely vulnerable, and defenseless.  Ana Claudia Talancon's performance is extremely brave, natural, and utterly convincing.  Talancon is very impressive, and it's understandable how she got the role, even though a Latina was not what Nicholas originally had in mind for the character Amy.  Colin Hanks (King Kong) is also very good as Doug, a guy who seems like such a harmless loser, that you may even have some empathy for him, until his insidious and malevolent nature becomes very clear.  Doug is a master at planning, but is often flustered by the unexpected.  Still, he manages to improvise when necessary, often producing tragic results.

Pretty much everything you would want to know about the film is discussed by writer/director Eric Nicholas, in his rapid fire commentary track.  Nicholas covers the technical details, the cast, and his intentions and motivations at various points in the film, which has a trim 78 minute runtime.  The cinematography remarkably effective, and quite creative, with objects in the foreground obscuring the view, or blacked out corners.  Shot in HD video, sections of the movie were processed to give the appearance of surveillance video, complete with occasional static, and fade outs.

The prevalence of stalking, issues of trust, and the easy access to tools of surveillance, are some of the key points of emphasis.  While events may fall into place a bit too smoothly, it does not detract too much from this disturbing, and thought provoking, cautionary tale.",1324944000,,3927,5.136792452830188
2752785,4,B000N2HDHI,"This movie was not what I expected. I loved Ana Claudia Talancon in ""El Crimen de Padre Amaro"". I wanted to see what other films Ana had done and came across this film in Amazon.com. I also noticed Tom Hanks son was in this film and was really interested. Colin Hanks played the perfect psycho peeping tom. In this day an age it is easy to steal someones privacy away. This is a great little film and proves that when you have a great story and great actors that low budget can work. Ana is perfect as the victim being peeped on and you can see her living her daily life. I guess you never realize how scary it is for someone to invade your space. Ana's character has some very embarrassing situations filmed without her knowledge. Can you imagine someone filming you as you shower or do the bathroom. The director did a terrific job setting the feeling of horror as you watch this poor girl. The audience see's what the perpetrator see's. If you loved Ana Claudia Talancon in ""El Crimen de Padre Amaro"" She does a great job in this film as well. Also watch Colin Hanks I can see him step out of his dad's shadow one day.

This go-round, the film stars kid is Colin Hanks, son of Tom, and the victimized babe is Ana Claudia Talancon.

While not a found footage movie, it is, in essence a similarly first-person psychological horror film. The creepy-factor in this one is off the charts for the realism of it all, and the ever-increasing reality of stalkers using electronic eavesdropping and video to perpetrate their crimes. The protagonist in this film does a very good job playing the role of an obsessed man in a slowly unfolding but well planned effort to observe and eventually manipulate his victim (I won't spoil the movie with more details on that). This one earned one of my very few four-star reviews and I plan to watch it again today.

Overall; more than a bit unsettling.
