8244091,3,B0012684I6,"product received on time and in good condition. It must be noted that the title of the movie and description are deceiving. This film has nothing to do with the movie ""Amelie"" except its star. This movie is not a continuation of part 1. Otherwise, it's a fair movie but nowhere near the film that was presented in
'Amelie"" and that was a great disappointment.",1346716800,17,359,4.538461538461538
