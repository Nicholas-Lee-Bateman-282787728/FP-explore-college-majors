2385927,4,B000ADWDG6,"""Guerrilla: The Taking Of Patty Hearst"" is an exciting, fascinating documentary film about one of the most freakish, bizarre news items of the 1970s and one of the strangest kidnappings ever recorded. With priceless footage, audio recordings and eyewitness accounts, director Robert Stone chornicles the formation of the SLA, its birth as a bastard child of the radical calls for change in the 1960s, and their decent into a media circus item following the kidnapping of Patty Hearst.

Stone's film is pieced together as a great suspense story, capturing the tension and drama of the events. With sharp editing, pounding music and some interesting political insight, he captures a unique time and place in American history. This is the first film that successfully frames the story of the Symbionese Liberation Army in the context of the 60s, 70s youth culture. Former members discuss their anger at a government gone mad with the Vietnam War, the popularity of figures like Che Guevara and Malcolm X, and how guerrilla warfare was seen as a plausible tool to bring about radical change even in the United States. Stone allows the SLA members to express themselves with their own words, the living and dead describe their indoctrination and motivations in interviews and preserved recordings. This is the best document on this small bit of radical 70s history.

The film's key moments come near the middle, when the SLA kidnaps Patty Hearst, granddaughter of media tycoon William Randolph Hearst (himself the basis for Orson Welles' ""Citizen Kane""), after weeks of socialist demands from the guerrillas, including a plan to distribute food to poor communities, Hearst stuns the world by emerging herself as a combatant, robbing banks and taking part in shoot-outs. This is all well-documented in the film with interesting footage of Patty's father conceding the SLA's demands, her bewildered fiance not really knowing how to react to what's happening and Patty's own, strange recordings, first expressing the guerrillas' demands and then promoting their ideaology. Interesting facts are shared, including how California authorities used schools for the deaf and blind to examine the recordings and then bank security camera footage of an SLA robbery where Patty famously participates.

""Guerrilla"" tells this story with crackling energy and style, Stone manages to keep us watching and creates atmosphere. But the film never reaches its full potential because it also decides, curiously, to skip over key material audiences would really like to know about. The film does a superb job chronicling the kidnapping and police manhunt, but we never get a full view into exactly why Patty turned into an SLA member, or at least various points of view on the question. We get a few flashes of what she went through as a hostage but no complete account. Stone also decides to completely skip over Patty's trial after capture, a moment of the story that would serve the narrative well. What do her former comrades, now serving time in prison, have to say about her getting a full pardon from President Clinton? What has Patty herself have to say about her ordeal? I was left wondering why Stone decided to close his film with a recent interview Hearst gave on British TV and cuts to the end credits right when she's about to actually begin the interview. ""Guerrilla"" feels short at an hour and thirty minutes, too short for such a fascinating tale.

Those observations aside, this is still a thrilling, fascinating tale. Like ""One Day In September,"" ""Guerrilla"" is a documentary that can compete with the best high-tech action films have to offer. It will surely remain for quite some time the best available film resource on the SLA's 15 minutes of fame during radical times, and on one of the most bizarre, puzzling hostage cases in American history.",1216684800,,3843,5.0663507109004735
2385928,5,B000ADWDG6,"Drawing on the many and varied forces that created the counterculture of the sixties and seventies, this film guides us into the enigmatic true story of the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA).  The story of Patricia Hearst's kidnapping is intertwined with the SLA story and wraps the enigma in a riddle giving the tale even greater appeal of a mystery.  Few questions are answered directly in this film but interviews with former SLA members does shed some light on this mystery.  In the end, it may be impossible to know the truth if Ms. Hearst truly joined the SLA or if she was acting out of some mental coping mechanism.  But, in the end, the point of the film does not seem so much to convey the SLA or Patty Hearst story as it is to convey insight into the unrest of that time in American history that led to the SLA.

A gripping documentary giving a lot to consider concerning American history, culture, counterculture, and the enigma wrapped in a riddle that seems to summarize those years.  Very insightful and entertaining.",1204761600,,1031,4.668508287292818

With Nixon close to resigning from the presidency, our nation's compass was already going haywire when the Hearst kidnapping unfolded. Stone unearths fascinating footage from the time (including stunned father Randolph Hearst dealing with the press), and for perspective, interviews former SLA members in the present day.

2385931,5,B000ADWDG6,"Sung to the tune of the theme from ""Mr. Ed"":

A Hearst is a Hearst, she was immersed

In the SLA, but though the rest were cursed

To die amid machine gun bursts,

Where was Patty Hearst?

Go right to the source, her Dad, of course

He paid off the prison and police force

Who freed her, she showed no remorse

The famous Patty Hearst

People yakkety-yakked and leaked

Her whereabouts and then

The FBI came and picked her up

And then all the bull-s**t began

A Hearst is a Hearst and money talks

The cell door swings open and Patty walks

She writes a book and then she hawks it

""Now listen to this:

I AM PATTY HEARST!""",1175126400,3,626,4.126050420168068
2385932,5,B000ADWDG6,"One of the best documentaries to have been released in the past few years, Guerilla retells the story of Patty Hearst and the Symbionese Liberation Army (the SLA) and in doing so, paints a disturbing and sad picture of recent American history.

The SLA were a group of self-styled ""revolutionaries"" who exploded into the American conciousness by gunning down Oakland's first black superintendent of schools (in the name of the people, of course).  When two SLA members were arrested for the crime, the organization reacted by kidnapping Patricia Hearst, the 19 year-old heiress of the Hearst newspaper empire and, therefore, a member of what they referred to as ""the ruling class.""  For months, the country watched transfixed as the SLA demanded that the Hearst family feed every poor person in California and listened to a series of audio tapes released by the captive Patty.  On her fourth tape, Patty renounced her family and announced that she was now a member of the SLA.  Within days, the missing Patty Hearst was spotted apparently holding up a bank with her new comrades.  As the FBI searched for both her and the SLA, it was debated whether Patty had been brainwashed or if her conversion was sincere.  It was a question that remains unanswered today and it is that question (amongst others) that makes Guerilla so fascinating.

Though Hearst is not interviewed in the film, a rather clear portrait of her does come through.  Through interviews with two surviving SLA members and through her own audio tapes (the DVD includes each of those tapes), Hearst comes across as a rather niave and spoiled child who lacked the imagination to really form any opinions (or identity) of her own.  One of the more memorable scenes in the documentary is when one of the former SLAers relates how disappointed he was when he first met the newly radicalized of Patty Hearst and didn't discover the radical firebrand he had expected but instead met somebody who he describes as being ""middle class.""

Indeed, if one walks away with any definite impression of the SLA and Hearst at the end of Guerilla, it is one of a bunch of kids who, convinced of their own wisdom and moral superiority, live out a fantasy gets a bit out of hand and results in the deaths of at least four innocent people.  Once Hearst was finally arrested and put on trial, she immediately abandoned her radical persona and retreated back into the safety of her family that she had previously rejected.  It is the genius of Guerilla that it manages to take the rather sordid story of Patty Hearst and use it as a metaphor for the transformation of '60s idealism to '80s materialism.

Guerilla is a truly powerful and very entertaining film.  Director Robert Stone masterfully arranges his material in such a way that the film's theme is clearly presented without ever getting heavy handed or ham fisted.  This is the rare documentary that gives the audience all of the material it needs to truly make up its own mind about the events being presented on the screen.",1140566400,9,3026,4.790384615384616
2385933,5,B000ADWDG6,"As a teenager, I was rarely interested in the news or social events but I was riveted by the Patty Hearst kidnapping and faithfully tuned in to the evening news to see what had happened next. It seems odd that no one has made a serious documentary about the sensational events of that time until now. This is a riveting film that traces the development of the SLA (Symbionese Liberation Army), the kidnapping of Patty Hearst, and the group's ultimate demise. The filmmakers make no attempt to analyze whether Hearst was a willing accomplise or victim of brainwashing but instead simply present the facts in chronological order. Interviews with former SLA members Russ Little (an original founder of the group), Mike Bortin and San Francisco Chronicle reporter Tim Findley highlight the film which also features footage from newscasts and the infamous Patty Hearst audio tapes. Extras on the dvd contain the full audio recordings of Patty Hearst as well as the Hibernia Bank robbery tapes and Sacremento Courtroom footage of the recent SLA members who were charged with the death of Myrna Opsahl, who was murdered during a bank robbery. Highly recommended!",1131062400,9,1155,5.020833333333333
2385934,5,B000ADWDG6,"On Monday, February 4, 1974, soon-to-be-20-year-old Patricia Campbell Hearst (heiress and daughter of San Francisco newspaper executive Randolph Hearst) was kidnapped at gunpoint from her California apartment and stuffed into the trunk of a car being driven by one of several members of a revolutionary terrorist group calling itself ""The Symbionese Liberation Army"" (SLA). Thus began one of the most sensational and bizarre news stories of the late 20th century. A story which had America transfixed for more than a year-and-a-half.

""Guerrilla: The Taking Of Patty Hearst"" takes the viewer on a spellbinding 89-minute journey deep inside the fabric of this strange odyssey filled with terrorism, kidnapping, murder, bank robbery, shootouts with police, and the unusual ""feed the hungry"" demands made by the SLA.

This DVD program dissects the Hearst Kidnapping story from Day 1 in February 1974 until Day 592, which was the day Patty Hearst was finally taken into custody in San Francisco on September 18, 1975.

Two months after her abduction, to the amazement of her family (and the rest of America), a startling audio taped message had Patty announcing that she had joined forces with her kidnappers and was now being identified by a new name, ""Tania"".

Many segments of the original audio tapes sent to authorities by the SLA (with the voices of Patty and other SLA ""comrades"") are sprinkled throughout this program. The clarity of these audio tapes is quite good, too.

Patty ended up serving 22 months in prison for her part in an April 15, 1974, bank robbery, in which she was seen via the bank's security cameras brandishing an assault rifle while several SLA members robbed the bank of $10,960 in cash (although, according to an April 24th taped message by Patty Hearst herself, the precise amount of loot that was garnered in the heist by the robbers was $10,660.02, which I thought was kind of an odd figure; I guess one of the bandits grabbed a couple of pennies from a cash drawer before departing the bank).

The video of that Hibernia Bank robbery is also featured here, and is presented in a way which makes the skin crawl a little bit more -- complete with ""ticking clock"" and two ""gunshot"" sound effects. And it amazes me how clear that security-camera video footage is of that robbery. It looks in excellent condition, quality-wise. Patty's movements (and identity) are clearly defined on the video. It's so good, in fact, that Patty's lips were even able to be read by people who later examined the footage.

Each segment of this peculiar true-life drama unfolds in compelling detail during this polished documentary, which had me glued to the TV screen for its entire hour-and-a-half length. This is one of the finest true-crime documentary programs I've ever seen. It's nicely edited and contains a very good background musical score (which effectively accompanies the video we're watching on screen and is often quite eerie when combined with the on-screen images). A large amount of ""as-it-was-happening"" television news footage is what comprises the bulk of this documentary; along with interviews (circa 2001) of some former SLA members.

Of particular interest to this writer while viewing this film were the ""Live"" scenes of the police shootout in Los Angeles on May 17, 1974, which was a confrontation with SLA members in a residential area of L.A., resulting in the deaths of six SLA terrorists. For a brief time, it was thought that Miss Hearst was one of those victims.

This chilling shootout footage is somewhat nerve-racking to watch, for it seems surreal -- like a scene straight out of a Hollywood action movie. It was one of the first events of its kind to be shown around the country on Live television -- a real-life police vs. outlaw shoot-'em-up on Live TV, with hundreds of rounds of gunfire from automatic weapons being heard throughout the standoff. The scene then turned even more dramatic, as the house which was being used as a hideout by the SLA suddenly turned into a huge inferno of flames, killing all who were inside. Remarkable news footage indeed.

The Patty Hearst kidnapping story still continues to fascinate and intrigue even today. Was Patty ""brainwashed"" by her kidnappers and forced to participate in the Hibernia Bank heist? Or was she a willing participant? These questions still loom in some people's minds even now, decades after the strange events that consumed Miss Hearst, and the nation, in 1974 and '75. In January of 2001, Patricia Hearst was issued a full ""pardon"" by President Bill Clinton (just prior to Clinton's leaving office in favor of George W. Bush).

This DVD, distributed by ""New Video Group, Inc."" under its first-rate ""Docurama"" label, comes complete with some noteworthy Special Bonus Features too. Let's have a look at them......

>> Feature-Length Audio Commentary Track provided by the film's director, Robert Stone.

>> Audio Exclusive: The Patty Hearst Tapes. .... This is an extremely interesting bonus, lasting a total of 53-plus minutes. Included are six audio clips, each of them ""digitally re-mastered for increased clarity"", per the DVD's written info.

All of the clips feature the voice of Patty Hearst throughout the early portions of 1974. These are extended, more-complete versions of the audio tapes that are heard throughout the 89-minute ""Guerrilla"" documentary. These clips provide a fascinating (audio) glimpse into history and into the mind of the kidnap victim herself. (Although, I suppose it's up to each individual listening to the clips to decide whether or not these are the words of Patty's OWN mind or, instead, the words of a woman whose mind has been somehow manipulated and brainwashed to speak the words her captors wanted expressed to the world. When listening to her comments on these tapes, it is, indeed, a tough call to make.)

Here's a rundown of the exact audio footage that can be found here:

Clip 1.) From ""Day 9"" -- February 12, 1974 (Length: 11:20).

Clip 2.) From ""Day 13"" -- February 16, 1974 (8:09).

Clip 3.) From ""Day 34"" -- March 9, 1974 (10:44).

Clip 4.) From ""Day 59"" -- April 3, 1974 (8:43).

Clip 5.) From ""Day 80"" -- April 24, 1974 (3:51).

Clip 6.) From ""Day 124"" -- June 7, 1974 (10:19).

Warning: Some vulgar language is contained within these audio clips.

>> Deleted Scenes: Sacramento Courthouse. .... This 25-minute bonus was filmed on February 14, 2003, during the sentencing of SLA members for the murder of Myrna Opsahl during the 1975 Crocker Bank robbery in Carmichael, California.

>> Exclusive Footage: Hibernia Bank Robbery. .... This silent black-and-white video shows the complete ""Security Camera"" bank footage that was recorded during the Hibernia Bank robbery in San Francisco on April 15, 1974, at 9:40 A.M. (including slow-motion close-ups of Patty Hearst). .... Length of this bonus is 6:41.

>> Theatrical Trailer for ""Guerrilla: The Taking Of Patty Hearst"". .... This trailer is shown in its proper Widescreen (1.78:1) ratio. Trailer length is 2:05.

>> Photo Gallery. .... A view-at-your-own-pace Gallery of 11 still photos, including a pic of Patty Hearst's ""Wanted"" poster.

2385946,3,B000ADWDG6,"Guerrilla: The Taking of Patty Hearst

In 1974 Patty Hearst was kidnapped from her Berkeley California apartment by domestic terrorists. One fires a machine gun, as if to advertised their presence. She is taken to the gang's hideout. Patty is told to keep quiet if she wants to live. They are the ""Symbionese Liberation Army""! They threaten to kill her if the police come. Does this group have delusions about their importance? Keeping her in a dark room and mistreated is one way to condition her will. Their demands for free food will be met, their other demands are impossible to meet. Patty's comments are recorded. She is threatened continually. She is given physical therapy to keep her body in shape. ""Sex is a revolutionary act"" she is told. She is offered a choice: join them or be ""set free"" [a death threat?].

Patty is taught new beliefs and questioned. [Would continual blindfolding harm her sight?] ""Tanya"" is a guerrilla for the SLA. She is taught a new language, and trained for violent action. ""Tanya"" makes a recording, she reads what was written for her. Does her family believe her? She is taught to draw and fire an unloaded pistol. Will she be ""comradely""? Next the gang robs a bank and shoots a man. Patty is happy to be accepted rather than killed. One man wants to be like Ch Guevara and create a bloodbath. [A death wish?] ""The people love us."" There is a view of San Francisco from the front window. They plan to move to a new city. ""Why is this happening to me?"" They must be quiet to avoid notice. They play with their guns for practice. They visit a Sporting Goods store. ""Tanya"" shoot to free her comrades. [They should trust her now.] They commandeer a car, then another van. The young man helps them. The radio tells them the news.

The TV shows the attack on the SLA's hideout. Can they help them? That house catches fire and burns to the ground. ""They died as they expected to."" They return to San Francisco and read the newspaper reports. They travel to Pennsylvania for peace and quiet. Will they be noticed? They cultivate a small garden [a better hobby?]. There is personal conflict. They return to San Francisco and rob another bank. Their leader decides to attack police cars. Personal hatreds affect the group. The FBI arrives to arrest Patty and Wendy. Bill and Emily were also caught. Patty finds this funny. Patty's lawyer argues for her. Will this be a show trial?

An EEG tests Patty's brain. Is everything OK? She is told Bill and Emily don't have power over her now. ""Trust me"" says her lawyer. Psychiatrists examine her. F. Lee Bailey defends her. Her answers are vague. Was she ""brainwashed""? [Pavlovian conditioning.] Her answers tell about her state of mind. She is found guilty and sent to a Federal prison. She gets a new lawyer. Can they change people's prejudices against her? Patty talks about the fantasies in the press and how they affect people. [Is this caused by people's envy and jealousy?] The end tells what the trial results were. Patty got a Presidential Pardon in 1979. [Did she rely on her old man's money?]

One comment about Patty's kidnapping compared it to the crime novel ""No Orchids for Miss Blandish"", a very scandalous and shocking novel in its day (Banned in Boston). This movie seems slow paced after the beginning, as if on a lower budget. Some of the language cannot be broadcast. Can such an event occur again? Is it comparable to those who are ""brainwashed"" into becoming terrorists? Where is Patty Hearst today?",1389484800,2,3496,4.678048780487805

2385950,4,B000ADWDG6,"The story of Patty Hearst's kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) is well known. And yet, the documentary Guerilla offers viewers something new - videos, still photos, and audio of the actual events. The film also features interviews with some of the case's major players. Given its well-worn subject matter, Guerilla doesn't break much new ground, but it does educate and entertain the viewer.

Guerilla opens by explaining what the United States was like in the 1970s; the 60s were over and many people were uncomfortable because they felt that society had changed too much - or not enough. The SLA obviously was in the latter camp. Their feelings may not have been unusual, but their actions certainly were - they decided to become armed revolutionaries to strike ""the fascist insect that preys upon the life of the people.""

The SLA started by murdering the head of the Oakland, California, public schools and then kidnapped Hearst. Unsurprisingly, Guerilla spends a lot of time pondering whether Hearst really joined the SLA after her kidnapping or whether she was coerced into participating in their activities. As with most material on Hearst, the answer is equivocal. Unfortunately, the filmmakers did not interview Hearst, though they use archival footage to include her in the film.

The pictures and the audio are the real stars of Guerilla. The film includes the audiotapes of their bizarre communiques - though these do tend to ramble. The videos capture the SLA's involvement in bank robberies, shootouts, and other crimes. One bonus of the videos is that they also include the clothes, hair, and cars of the 1970s.

For those interested in political extremists or true crime, Guerilla is an enjoyable way to spend 90 minutes.",1286409600,,1753,5.076388888888889
2385951,4,B000ADWDG6,"Some films reviewed in this space are offered with the idea that viewing them will given the reader, especially the younger reader or those who are not familiar with the tumultuous events of the period, a fairly positive sense of what it was like to live through the turbulent 1960s and the early 1970s, the high water mark for the last time that we had the ""monster"" of American imperialism on the run or so we thought. A prime example of that type of review was one that I did a while back on the Black Panthers. Another more recent one was the animated/ documentary film footage provided in ""Chicago 10"". Other film reviews are offered to be more thought-provoking or just plain provocative. The film under review, ""Guerilla: The Taking Of Patty Hearst"", is of the latter type.

This film does a good job of presenting the actual events around the kidnapping of the Hearst newspaper heiress, Patty Hearst, by the upstart and then unknown Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) in the waning days of the militant leftist movement after the practical (in American terms) withdrawal from Vietnam War, through archival film footage, interviews and commenting by surviving members of the organization, reporters who covered the event, officials who were involved in the investigation and others with something to say about the matter. The startling, and perhaps sometimes bizarre train of events is well documented: the inexplicable murder of the Oakland Superintendent Marcus Foster; the kidnapping of UC/Berkeley college student Hearst; the ransom demand of food for the hungry of Oakland in exchange for her release that in turn ran amok; the abrupt change in the case with the apparent adaptive conversion by Hearst to the SLA cause; a serious of robberies including one in which a teller was killed; the massive, seemingly never-ending, on-going hunt for the SLA in the aftermath of that action: the widely viewed 'real time' police assault on an SLA ""safe-house"" that netted the leader, Cinque: the subsequent off-handed capture of new leaders Bill and Emily Harris and Patty Hearst; and, the subsequent trials, including Patty's commutation of sentence. All in all, if you want a refresher course on the case it is all there for you.",1267056000,,2232,5.0
2385952,5,B000ADWDG6,"This documentary showcases the incredible and horrific story of just how Patty Hearst was kidnapped by a small group of young terrorists calling themselves The Symbionese Liberation Army, or the SLA; and the degree of education and insight we get is phenomenal. This film really couldn't have been made any better; the story line flows along at a very good pace and as I watched the drama unfold I was mesmerized by the story and wondered to myself what would happen to Patty and the rest next. Amazon notes that the documentary doesn't take sides; but I think this is only partly true. While the film shows what the SLA wanted and could achieve by terrorizing the Hearst family, the filmmakers also show former members of the SLA being killed by police when they commandeered a house as well as other former members being sentenced to years in prison for what they did.

The story line follows the way things went very reliably; and it does an excellent job of piecing together archival footage including countless news video clips; audio clips from Patty and her kidnappers; video of Patty's parents talking to the media very frequently and much, much more. The archival footage of Mr. Hearst talking to the press about his ability and strong desire to get his daughter's release is heartrending. We also see the efforts of the FBI to find and retrieve Patty to safety and some of the footage with the man who was then Patty's fianc is also memorable. There are interviews with former members of the SLA and even more.

I could tell you so much more of the story but then I'd be spoiling it for you. However, I will say that even if you already know the entire story this will still be a worthwhile film to watch; it's brilliantly done and it leaves little or nothing to be desired.

The DVD also comes with several extra bonus features. There's an optional running commentary by director Robert Stone; ""The Patty Hearst Audio Tapes;"" ""Hibernia Bank Footage;"" ""Sacramento Footage;"" a photo gallery; the theatrical trailer and more!

This film packs quite a punch; and I highly recommend it for people studying crime and the behavior of groups like the SLA. If you like documentaries in general, you may also want this for your collection.",1263427200,2,2240,4.721227621483376
2385953,2,B000ADWDG6,"The documentary is good enough, but it is FAR TOO SYMPATHETIC to the despicable, violent and evil-to-the-core SLA. The documentary allows the murdering violent thugs to present their B.S. propaganda, completely unchallenged. At no time do we hear from Patty Hearst about what she was forced to endure, nor do we hear from John Opsahl, whose mother was cruelly, savagely murdered in cold blood, so that this evil, rag-tag bunch of scumbags could fullfill their so-called ""cause"". That aspect of this documentary made me want to puke. Just imagine if someone made a documentary about the KKK or some nazi group and only allowed the members of that fringe group to spread their sick, twisted propaganda, but would not interview any of the victims of those groups. That is basically what this love letter to the SLA does. The EXTRAS section is the only place we really hear from victim John Opsahl and his eloquent testimony is cut short in mid-sentence at the end. I don't care what ""cause"" someone claims to promote. NOTHING justifies kidnapping a teenage girl, repeatedly raping her, beating her, torturing her and then locking her in a closet. NOTHING!

2385955,5,B000ADWDG6,"This is an excellent documentary! Patty's much older than me, but I still have childhood recollections of the daily news broadcasts of the kidnapping and the trial in its aftermath. Having been born in Berkeley and graduated from Cal., I thought that watching The Taking of Patty Hearst would be a nostalgic, though effective, means of familiarizing myself with details that I was too young to remember. But Robert Stone's film shows that the kidnapping, the deadly travails of the SLA, the trial of Patty Hearst, and the legal proceedings and prison terms engulfing the lives of the other terrorists live on not only in documentary footage but also in the hearts and minds of the SLA members, those who played roles in the events surrounding the SLA, those who reported the facts, as well as in the consciousness of the United States of America. The Taking of Patty Hearst provides great entertainment and also a warning as to how the American dream can misfire.",1228608000,3,963,4.842424242424243
