4653683,5,B005COLEOA,"I knew if any actor could make me finally appreciate William Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"", it is Christopher Plummer. I was right! I won't go into the play itself, or whether Shakespeare is the greatest playwright of all time; or whether Hamlet is the greatest male role of all time, and all that. Simply put, Plummer is completely mesmerizing as Hamlet. I couldn't take my eyes off charismatic Christopher for a second.  If Plummer's Hamlet isn't definitive, (the ""Best Hamlet"" is a topic for endless debate),  his interpretation definitely deserves to stand alongside Laurence Olivier and Richard Burton. But, I almost expected Plummer  would knock my socks off. The real surprise here is Robert Shaw as King Claudius. Shaw easily matches Plummer in the charisma department. Shaw's Claudius is formidable, forceful, sexual and dangerous. Different productions place the emphasis on different character relationships. A production could place all the emphasis on Hamlet himself; or Hamlet and Ophelia, perhaps. Many productions place an obvious emphasis on the relationship between Hamlet and his mother, Queen Gertrude. Dramatically speaking, this production is an intriguing battle of wills between Hamlet and his uncle-stepfather Claudius.
  Director Philip Saville's production was considered ""radical"" in many aspects. It was filmed at Elsinore Castle, where the play takes place. Many scenes were filmed outdoors. A lot of the play is set at night; directly against the crashing waves of the sea. The black and white photography is, of course, well-suited to the dark story. The supporting cast is excellent. Michael Caine, two years away from his breakout role in ""Alfie"", is an especially devoted Horatio. Dyson Lovell is a youthful, fresh-faced Laertes.  Jo Maxwell Muller is an extremely interesting choice as tragic Ophelia. Muller looks to be no older than 15; she may have been younger. (Plummer, by contrast was around age 34-35 here). Muller's ""mad scene"", where she looks like she might turn into Linda Blair in ""The Exorcist"" any second, is heartbreaking. Even more creepy is her funeral scene. Muller is literally lowered into the grave, and it looks like Hamlet and Laertes are going to kill each other right inside her grave, too! June Tobin, looking about the same age as Plummer, plays Hamlet's mother Queen Gertrude. The famous bedroom scene between Hamlet and Gertrude explodes with the expected dramatic intensity. Roy Kinnear makes a memorable appearance as the Gravedigger. Donald Sunderland, in the brief role of Fortinbras, is the only actor who appears to be out of place.
  The great mystery is: why did the BBC keep this dramatic gem buried for 47 years? The DVD transfer is excellent, especially since this videotaped production hasn't seen the light of day since 1964. Also, running at 2 hours and 50 minutes, this ""Hamlet"" still moves along at a better pace than many other productions-- although I did take a break and watched it over a two day period. The DVD begins with a promo for an ""intelligent, modern production"" of ""Hamlet"" starring David Tennant and Patrick Stewart. Let's see... watch another ""Hamlet"" after watching Plummer and Shaw at their best, career apex?...OH, PLEASE!!!!
  Even better than ""Hamlet"" is the 90 minute live interview with Christopher Plummer himself on the second DVD. NPR film critic David Edelstein is a bit two fawning during the interview. But Plummer, now 80 years old and an extremely entertaining rascal, is too sharp to let much get by him. Plummer is keenly self-aware of his successes and his failures, both as an actor and as a human being. It seems Plummer finally learned humility when he hit middle-age; and his third wife Elaine demanded that he stop his drinking and other self-destructive behaviors. Plummer talks about everything from Shakespeare to ""The Sound Of Music."" There's also an infamous film called ""Waterloo"", that was almost the waterloo of his career. Plummer discusses working with such directors as Elia Kazan, Robert Wise, and John Huston, and working with his ""Hamlet"" co-stars Michael Caine and Robert Shaw. Plummer's memories of prickly Rex Harrison and his tragic wife Rachel Roberts are alternately humorous and heartbreaking. I honestly did not know whether to laugh or cry, so I did both. Two of Plummer's leading ladies, Helen Mirren and Julie Andrews, receive special mention. In the case of  this ""Hamlet"" 47 years is too long to wait, and 90 minutes is too short of a time to spend with the talented and fabulous Christopher Plummer.",1319932800,73,4542,5.149253731343284
4653718,5,B005COLEOA,"This is a wonderful production.  Plummer's Hamlet is second only to that of Olivier.  (Gawd, they were handsome.)  It is a bit longer than need be; however, no Claudius bests Robert Shaw's performance.  Oh, so sexy. No wonder Gertrude went gaga for him.  Hamlet does, after all, compare him to a satyr (so very Oedipal of him).

For those who do not like black & white films, the very best is David Tennant as Hamlet-- brilliant if a bit manic; and Patrick Stewart's Claudius exudes a sly, dangerous animal magnetism.

When those scalpers lower the price, I would love to watch Richard Burton in the Broadway role, but I digress.",1437955200,2,629,4.663636363636364
4653719,4,B005COLEOA,First saw this Hamlet on television years ago as a seventh grade assignment - it had just been produced - 1963 (?). I've had a soft spot in my heart for Christopher Plummer ever since. If you can dazzle a 12-year old with Hamlet - you're good.,1436140800,4,243,4.191489361702128

4653723,5,B005COLEOA,"It took me fifty years to get hold of this so I could watch it at home again. I saw it when it was first aired in 1964 and spent many years trying to track down the recording. Some years ago I discovered it in the Paley Center for Media in New York, where I saw it a couple of years ago. They only had the first part, in several sections, on old videotape, so only viewable on a small cathode ray tube TV. So you can imagine my delight on receiving the DVD from Amazon. Christopher Plummer is a superb Hamlet (even better than his role in The Sound of Music). Three years ago he presented his new movie of The Tempest, performed at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Canada at Symphony Space in New York, then had the audience in stitches with his reminiscences. All this comes into my mind when I watch Hamlet at Elsinore, together with enjoyment of the fine English actors Michael Caine, Robert Shaw and Alec Clunes. Is this the best Hamlet? I'm not equipped to judge, but to my mind he is definitely among the best, as he gets right inside the part in a way that some actors have not been able to do.",1414108800,4,1106,4.221698113207547

4653726,5,B005COLEOA,"Finally purchased this after reading the reviews.  I am glad I did as Plummer's performance is a tour de force.  The man hits all the marks beautifully and masterfully.  I have seen my share of Hamelts (Burton, Jacobi, Kline, Branagh, Tennett, Olivier, and, yes, Hawke) and Plummmer outshines them all - even my former favorite Derek Jacobi.  Branagh is too mannered in the part.  He is watching himself act.  Olivier's is too cold-blooded.  Kline was simply not convincing.  Burton I loved and still do, thought he is not helped by a fairly mediocre supporting cast (other than Cronyn as Polonius).  Jacobi is sublime, yet Plummer does not so much play Hamlet as wear him.  With Plummer, the acting is not visible.  The part fits him like a glove and he moves from mood to mood naturally. His line readings are superb.  His ""O what a rogue and peasant slave am I"" soliloquy is awesome as his confrontation with Gertrude.
  Robert Shaw, a terribly underrated actor who spent the sixties performing in Pinter as well as Shakespeare plays, is a worthy Claudius (though not as pitch perfect as Jacobi).  It was a wonderful decision to have the character drunk while watching the play within the play.
  And lo and behold, among all his many other talents Michael Caine can do Shakespeare.  His Horatio is so good one wishes he would have tried his hand in other Shakespearean roles (Antonio in Merchant, Antony in Antony and Cleopatra, Cassius in Julius Caesar).
  I hesitated for months before buying this.  Don't do the same.  If Shakespeare is your drug you owe it to yourself to see Plummer and company.",1379462400,11,1604,4.756363636363637

4653728,4,B005COLEOA,"I have Hamlet with two of the greatest brits, Olivier and Branner on dvd and saw Ralph Finnes on broadway in the second row and
I'll tell you this, Christ Plummer was the best of the lot.  He was supurb and he usually is.  His taking of Sherlock Holmes was also the best I had seen.",1365552000,2,282,4.017857142857143
4653729,2,B005COLEOA,"I waited for this on DVD for a long time.  And I think that delay was part of the disappointment.  When something goes unseen for decades it tends to build an urban legend around itself like say Chaplin's Monsieur Verdoux.

To be brutally honest,with one exception, there really was not one really good aspect about this TV production.  Not one thing that was actually memorable.  I understand it was a TV film but neither the music nor Phil Saville's direction was in any way distinguished.  I don't recall one striking composition, not one memorably composed sequence.

Plummer as Hamlet was puzzling.  I didn't understand his concept behind the part.  I have seen, in whole or in part, many Hamlets.  From John Gielgud's, which I saw an excerpt of on TV, to Mel Gibson's.  I wouldn't put Plummer at the bottom, but he does not come close to the gold standard which is Gielgud.  In fact, I preferred the Gielgud directed Richard Burton's performance.  At least Burton, with his great voice, made some of the speeches really live and some of the repartee funny.  But Plummer, weakly directed by Saville, does not even do that.

The one really neat performance in the film is Michael Caine as Horatio.  What a consummate professional he was even at that young age. A man who really understands what his part is about and strikes at the heart of it from his first appearance.

And BTW, the DVD version has absolutely nothing to recommend it as extras.  There is a long interview with Plummer on a stage with a film critic.  THey talk about this Hamlet for about ten minutes.  And that is it as far as a commentary on this film  goes.",1358985600,9,1632,4.597222222222222
4653730,1,B005COLEOA,After seeing all these rave reviews I just had to add my own opinion that Plummer does a  laughable job as Hamlet. Shaw is good but the production as a whole is pretty bad. There.,1354233600,,179,4.114285714285714
4653731,5,B005COLEOA,"This BBC telecast was filmed in 1964 before Plummer, Shaw, or Caine became the household names they would soon become. Each is at his best here and we are fortunate to finally have it available and I advise buying it before it goes away. This was Michael Caine's only attempt at Shakespeare and he acquits himself quite well. Too bad he didn't have a shot at Macbeth, Benedict, and Richard III. There are cuts but not as many as in other filmed versions (aside from the Branagh which is word complete but somewhat stilted and too much focused on Branagh who is good but hardly in the league of Olivier, Burton, Plummer, and David Tennant or even Mel Gibson as The Dane).

No, this is NOT the ""best"" HAMLET (as one other erroneous claimed it to be) as that would be contested between Olivier, Burton, and David Tennant. Plummer ranks in this company.

Even though it's not ""the best"" grab it before it goes out of print.",1352505600,5,919,4.497005988023952
4653732,4,B005COLEOA,"This was an excellent production, filmed on location, with fine performances from a cast experienced in doing Shakespeare.  That it is in black and white is not really an issue.  A most engrossing performance.",1351987200,2,209,5.117647058823529
4653733,5,B005COLEOA,"Good production and not over acted. The pacing is just that; any faster or louder and you would have to strain to here the words. No one is trying to interpret or fill in what they think is missing or (what Shakespeare implied.)You of course notice Christopher Plummer, as Hamlet and Robert Shaw as Claudius, King of Denmark, But there are a lot of other great actors of which some will become famous.

This is a 1964 T.V.  version so it is a tad blurry and in monochrome.  However with today's DVD's and large screen displays you can see the pours on the face and the glint in the eye as the words we know so well are reveled.  I especially love the play within the play.

Just a quickie synopsis, Hamlet's father, the king on Denmark, is dead and his uncle marries his mother. His father's ghost returns to say they (uncle and mother) dispatched him on purpose (murder most foul) while he seeks revenge he is also distort. Many people want to say the prince Hamlet is indecision yet he outmaneuvers just about everyone and had depth of vision. How he acts with friends and relative to carry out his plans is the play.",1331942400,,1119,4.412621359223301
4653734,5,B005COLEOA,"I have waited over 40years to see this production and it didn't dissapoint. Christopher Plummer is mesmarising in the lead role, and Robert Shaw as Claudius is masterfull. This should be looked at by acting students or any students studying Shakespeare. His to be or not to be is filmed wonderfully and he speaks the words as if they have just come into his head. Plummer is so handsome here its no wonder he was chosen for Sound of Music, not that he needed his great acting skills for that, but it brought him to the attention of the world. The ladies in the cast dissapoint but don't be put off, its a wonderfull film even in black and white",1328400000,17,644,4.375
4653735,4,B005COLEOA,"Christopher Plummer's Hamlet is so fine that it redeems a bad film and very nearly redeems Plummer's career.  This is an actor whose gifts might have placed him among the immortals, but it was not to be.  The fault, dear Brutus, lay in his wayward commitment, a matinee-idol fecklessness that too often settled for the easy or thoughtless alternative.  His Iago (1982) was a palimpsest of clashing interpretations; his ashen Macbeth (1988) died before the play began; and his Lear's (2004) admonition that nothing can come from nothing was self-referential.  But his Cyrano (1973) was marvelous:  romantic and contemporary, eloquent and neurotic, edgy yet flamboyant, it synthesized centuries of acting styles in a manner reminiscent of Olivier.  I am happy to add Hamlet to his list of achievements.

Plummer gives us the complete Prince where others have given us parcels.  He has looks, presence, breeding, charm, athleticism, wit and consummate grace.  He also has a touch of the feminine (which works well for Hamlet), yet is incontestably virile.  This is important:  Hamlet's fitful misogyny must not be thought to spring from congenital attraction to his own sex.  There is no doubt that Plummer could have happily married Ophelia in a better world than Denmark.  Nor is there any doubt of his capacity for martial exploits if he were only convinced of their authenticity.  ""Hamlet does not think too much but too well,"" and Plummer has the capacity (lacking in Gibson, Branagh and Hawke) to convey a subtle and probing mind.  Michael Pennington (1980) was more intellectual, Derek Jacobi quirkier in his line-readings, but neither combined thought and surprise with sexual incandescence as Plummer does.  He is a bright particular star who has been wounded into inwardness, which is merely to say that he is Hamlet.

The movie serves as foil to Plummer:  its badness makes his talent stick fiery off indeed.  Filmed at Kronberg Castle in Elsinore, it struggles to work different interiors and grounds into every frame.  At times, this pays dividends:  the Players' first scene takes place in an open-air courtyard, conveying an exhilarating sense of freedom.  Unfortunately, most of the locations are hackneyed, distracting or nugatory.  Repeated shots of waves crashing upon rocks look backwards to Olivier's Hamlet (1948) and sideways at Kozintsev's (1964).  One stony corridor is much like another.  The Nunnery Scene is filmed in the castle's chapel (acceptable) with Hamlet standing above and beyond Ophelia in the pulpit (not).  The image of a minister exhorting a sinful parishioner may seem apt enough, but the actors do not play the scene that way, and the distance between them prevents dramatic synapses from connecting.  It is an ominous portent of postmodern decadence.

There are unkind cuts, bizarre compositions and moments of painful misdirection:  one can count the infelicities like sheep vaulting a stile.  The Mousetrap is reduced to its Dumb Show, making nonsense of Gertrude's ""The lady doth protest too much.""  Ophelia loses her second Mad Scene with all its beautiful and haunting floral imagery.  Polonius, Gertrude and Claudius speak in a single-file diagonal bisecting the screen:  perfect for a conga-line but awkward for a conversation.  Plummer is so tender, quiet and lucid with Ophelia that her ""O what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!"" seems madder than anything Hamlet has said.

The tally increases with a crupperful of bad performances.  Alec Clunes' Polonius is so fulsome and cute that one can hardly wait for Hamlet to kill him.  Jo Muller plays Ophelia as though she were 13, while Laertes (Dyson Lovell) is a cipher to a great accompt.  Gertrude's subtext  must be brought to the surface; June Tobin leaves it placidly submerged (""drown'd, drown'd"").  As Fortinbras, Donald Sutherland looks and sounds like an extraterrestrial.  The young Michael Caine is a beautiful creature, but beauty is wasted on Horatio, and Caine is so busy avoiding cockney vowels that he neglects to create a character.  The biggest disappointment is Robert Shaw, whose distracted, head-rubbing Claudius appears to be suffering from recurrent migraines.  Philip Locke, of blessed memory, brings more camp viciousness to Osric than I have ever seen, but it is too little, too late.

Plummer must salvage the proceedings, and so he does, seizing his plum role and plumbing it to its depths.  With him at the reins, at least one thing is healthy in the state of Denmark.  Sometimes there is no reason at all to see a Shakespeare production; sometimes there is only one.  Hamlet at Elsinore is out of joint, but Christopher Plummer was born to set it right.",1327881600,25,4680,5.12962962962963
4653736,5,B005COLEOA,"Okay, maybe not ""ever""...I haven't seen them all, for goodness sakes! But after viewing the manic interpretations by Kenneth Branagh and David Tennant, I was pleased with Christopher Plummer. He's energetic, playful at times, melancholy when necessary and all quite naturally presented. His performance never feels forced and his Hamlet doesn't come off like a spoiled brat the way others have I've seen. His delivery of the Shakespearean dialog is never rushed and always eloquent. Finally, the emotions he brings to every scene is impressive right down to small moments (for example, the child-like way he looks upon his father's ghost). He's definitely the best Hamlet I've ever seen!

The rest of the cast is fantastic as well. It's fun to see Michael Caine in the role of Horatio, as it's the first time he's ever tackled Shakespeare on film. Not surprisingly, he gives the dialog a kind of naturalistic delivery. In other words, he's not delivering the lines poetically, but practically. It works quite well. His best scene is easily the finale, in which his Horatio breaks down emotionally. I don't think you'll find a more powerful Horatio than this one.

Robert Shaw was a huge surprise as Claudius. I knew he was a fine actor, but his prose is wonderfully delivered. Add to that his dynamic screen presence and you've got a truly magnificent Claudius. I mean, this is a role famously played by Derek Jacobi, Alan Bates and Patrick Stewart among many others. Yet Shaw may have surpassed them all (although I do love Jacobi's take).

I don't know much about June Tobin or Jo Maxwell Muller, but their performances as Gertrude and Ophelia respectively are quite perfect as well. Both are incredibly sympathetic and touching at times. Tobin's emotional interaction with Hamlet in the bedroom scene (when Polonius is killed) is the most convincing I've seen. Just as 18 year old Muller's depiction of Ophelia's mental breakdown absolutely stuns.

It's rare to see a Shakespearean production in which so many performances were so RIGHT in the roles. It's amazing really.

At first, the production values seem rather minimalist. But filming in an actual castle in Elsinore is as authentic as it gets and you never feel like your watching manufactured sets. Having said that, you won't find sweeping, widescreen cinematography and rousing musical scores here. It's filmed in black and white with several closeups. It's quite a contrast to Branagh's epic version of the same play. Just as Branagh's is brilliant in it's own way, this 1964 television production is brilliant in almost the opposite direction. It sinks it's teeth into Shakespeare's words. It takes it's time to develop emotionally. It somehow feels more personal.

I'd say this is an absolute must for Hamlet fans.",1323561600,35,2780,5.045751633986928
4653737,5,B005COLEOA,"I enjoyed seeing Christopher performing this role, even though one could see his variation in delivering his 'A Game"" in a number of scenes. The very good ones were excellent, and the others were pedestrian. I also enjoyed seeing Michael Caine before he became widely known. Robert Shaw was at his evil best.

For a more comprehensive portrayal of the play, Kenneth Brannaugh's is better. I have seen over 20 performances (live & recorded) of Hamlet, and all bring out greater insight into the human condition. This performance doesn't fail in that regard. I would say in terms of overall satisfaction that it rated in the top half of the performances that I have had the pleasure to see.",1323475200,4,688,4.781512605042017

with Christopher Plummer

Christopher Plummers Hamlet is among the very best, if not the best and it should be seen by anyone who ever sees Hamlet. Reviewing his acting or the others is a bit of a fools errand, there are so many opinions about how Hamlet is best performed and filmed, why things work or they dont. And for those of us who have been around theatre long enough it is apparent there are even different vogues in performing and staging style in different eras. This one is fairly timeless and the casting, unlike most of the others, also works well, usually very well. The directorial choices are good, also, some, very good, like the scene with Claudius and Gertrude, When sorrows come.

The BBC however can be justly ashamed of the DVD transfer, to which they seem to have negligently done not even the most basic improvements to remedy. For the first full thirty-nine straight minutes there are several dark smudges, not spots, but bigger than that, and not moving, smudges. The two largest are close to centre screen, the others more toward the periphery. They only disappear at the 39 minute mark when Rosencrantz and Guildenstern enter. But then, while the smudges disappear, the sound develops a loud hum, as if the speaker or the microphone was placed too near an electrical source. This sound problem persists for five full minutes, then disappears, but then the smudges re-appear again until the 54 minute mark (after To be or not to be). After another disappearance of the smudges, they re-appear around the 61 minute mark (Polonius and Ophelias scene after Get thee to a nunnery). Lets leave chronicling the smudges, sufficing it to say the same ones continue to come and go and whenever they are present there is also some dark and light horizontal banding.

Next, at the 79 minute mark, the scene of Hamlet and Horatio, the screen becomes full of moving dark vertical scratches, as many as ten of them, and the sound track becomes extremely muddy (and the smudges are back). This condition persists to the 86 minute mark, one of the scratches becoming a large double scratch dark and light, then becoming two, through to the end of the players play. The muffling of the sound track continues, disappears, then resumes, then disappears., a few times. Then around 140 minutes something goes wonky with the contrast in many scenes, becoming pale and washed out. The final scenes go back to very muddy sound

Despite all these ridiculous faults, the Plummer Hamlet is a fabulous version and well worth seeing. When I purchased it from the BBC shop, after purchasing one on amazon and wondering if it was a pirated version, (from the BBC it was  $5, but the shipping price is ridiculous, $16; the price at amazon is $15, some used and new, slightly cheaper) it turned out both copies have exactly the same faults. Those reviewers here who have written that the transfer is a high quality digital transfer we cant possibly be watching the same film. If they would like to comment further, I would be interested to hear it.

Sadly there are enough more recent and high tech versions of Hamlet, including the BBCs David Tennant version, that the BBC is unlikely to clean up the Plummer version. Mores the pity.",1498953600,,3236,4.749110320284697

The most common flaw is that the script is cropped. The most common extraction is to remove the sub-plot with Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern. This version does not remove those scenes. It appears to be complete. It boasts that it was performed and recorded in the very same Elsinore Castle in which Shakespeare's play took place. That may be the reason for some of the weakness in the photography and sound. I often had a hard time hearing some of the minor actors, although there was no trouble hearing the major actors. Christopher Plummer in the title role was fabulous. He played his ""demented"" scenes better than anyone except, possibly David Tennant in a very recent filming. Robert Shaw as Claudius was very good, but not quite as good as Derek Jacobi in Kenneth Branagh's version. The role of Polonius was well done, but the quality drops off from there. Michael Caine plays Horatio, and is undistinguished in the part. This is NOT a version to watch if you have seen no other versions. Your best ""first"" look is Branagh's version, which is complete.

8465720,5,B005COLEOA,"Plummer is the best Hamlet I've seen, crazy, unpredictable, he owns the role. Horatio is a difficult part but Caine brings it to life. Shaw almost steals the film as a robust sexy Claudius. Even Sutherland's weird accent is okay in this thing. The Gertrude/Hamlet 'closet' scene burns up the screen. I was initially feeling a bit iffy about not seeing the ghost but it works here with the emotion playing off Hamlets face. The only dud is Ophelia, she starts of well, mocking Laertes was a good touch, but her mad scene is amateurishly over the top, this is exactly how not to play her.",1442620800,2,586,4.537735849056604
