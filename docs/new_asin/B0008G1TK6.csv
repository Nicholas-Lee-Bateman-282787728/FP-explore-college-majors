8056155,4,B0008G1TK6,"I was happy to have found a copy of this even if it is a VHS it is a very interesting account of the filming of the Everest IMAX.  After seeing ""Storm over Everest"" I remembered seeing this account on a PBS channel but have never been able to find it before. It covers the 1996 Everest tragedy from another viewpoint.  It was in very good condition and came promptly.  It's short, but if you are interested in Everest you will like it.",1237680000,2,435,4.216867469879518
