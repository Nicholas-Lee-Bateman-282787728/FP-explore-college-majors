8299558,5,B001EUGO64,My girl Christie Love!  When I was a little girl I wanted to be her!  She's such a pretty actress.  The show is campy but she's really cool!!,1445558400,3,141,3.9642857142857144
8299559,3,B001EUGO64,"Christie Love (Teresa Graves) is really a substandard cop who is too direct. She manages to subdue her opponent even though she can't kick her foot higher than a guy's kneecap. She goes after a heroin dealer with about as much tact as Peter Sellers. The film causally drops the n-word without anyone getting sued or charged with a hate crime. All the cops had big hair back then. There was no concern over warrants and jurisdictions. A credit card could open any dead bolt lock.

The film has camp value if you pay attention. Oh yes. It is nice to know a street hooker costs the same now as it did in 1974. How do they get by?

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.

In an early scene a would-be John calls prostitute posing Christie the N-word when she asks for too much money. She causally walks off calling him a ""N-lover."" In 1974 I would not have thought nothing of this scene. Now it is worth noting in how times have changed in one generation.",1361145600,3,956,4.359550561797753
