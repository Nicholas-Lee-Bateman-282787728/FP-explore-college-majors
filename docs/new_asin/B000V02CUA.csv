8216113,5,B000V02CUA,"We golf fans are used to the official films of the mayor championships ( masters, us open, pga)  the not only focus on the competition but also on everything that happens outside the course.

Sometimes they get to be melancolic because some great one retires, sometimes they get to be very emotional (remember 1997 masters?) , and so on...

In the case of the OPEN CHAMPIONSHIP Official series the same high level is reached, i not only recomend this year 2007 (it was pretty intense..) but also 2000, 2005, 2006 ( these are the one i have seen).

There is an additional plus for all the US Golf Fans , you get to see not only the Open Championship but also the SENOIR and the AMATEUR versions of this year , and i think you will enjoy them as i did ....

All in all this product is a must have!",1197936000,,795,4.23841059602649
