5188454,3,B008X8L8AW,"This is based on the Heavy Metal series which means that each episode must stand alone but the entire series should weave together in the end.  The acting was weak and the fight sequences left a lot to be desired (except for the ones with Michael Jai White - who is an incredible martial artist!), but it is an okay diversion for half an hour.",1398211200,,343,4.276923076923077

5188457,4,B008X8L8AW,"Saw 'Kings Crown' and 'The Endomorphe' on the SciFi channel. I really enjoyed them both. I read the Heavy Metal comics when I was young. I was disappointed with the Heavy Metal movie, but this show delivers and had the feel of the comic. I am VERY glad to see this show in a half hour format; all story, less dumb filler. I hope they make many more episodes.

I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I agree, the fight scenes are pretty bad. But then again, I just don't like fight scenes. If it's story driven like in Kings Crown, OK, but just having them for having them's sake, it's a drag on the story. Show how the characters use their heads to avoid fighting instead of always showing them resorting to their fists, swords, guns, or whatever first. The fight should be an unexpected payoff result, not an expected one, like the cliche bar scene fights you see in every dumb show and movie you can think of.

I like the fact that some of the cast members appear as new characters in other episodes. It's a nice twist that works for me. Good cast too. Competent acting, not great, but competent.

I would like to buy a DVD set, but these prices are well beyond my budget, which when I posted this was in the $70 range. I'll keep watching on it on the SciFi channel.",1397952000,9,1264,4.236514522821577
5188458,1,B008X8L8AW,"I can understand the concept of this showing wanting to put everything ""awesome"" in to a single series but it just doesn't work. The storyline is muddled with no clear character to really pull for or any reason for the viewer to want to know what happens next. The fight scenes are the worst; at one point the actor's head reacts the wrong way to the punch. I can't believe they left it in there. Not to mention each episode is only 22 minutes, not enough time to do anything with the story and it feels like major cuts have happened on the first episode. If you're into checking out just how bad shows can go wrong, by all means check this out.

5188494,1,B008X8L8AW,"I went into this knowing it wasn't going to be high art, but watched it for one of the actors in it. If only there had been a free trial of this episode. I feel bad knowing my money went, at least in some small way, to the people that made this.

I don't know what Heavy Metal is other than I think I saw a photo from a comic or an album or something when I was a kid. I don't even have that knowledge to temper my desire to gouge out my brain.

The acting was awful, the effects were awful, the dialogue was awful, the sentient turtles were awful, the slow-mo cutscenes that were slapped together to highlight the narration of the whole story by these turtles were awful. I would bet good money that the actors went home and drank themselves unconscious after having to spout those lines. At the very least I'm sure some of them went home and were ashamed of how far they'd fallen to take that job.

I don't usually review shows and movies on here but I felt it was my civic duty to warn everyone to save their money.

It was like they put 40 sci-fi flavored monkeys in a barrel full of paper and pens, rolled it down a hill, stabbed some sharp swords into the barrel, removed the dead monkey, took some acid, and then interpreted the blood spatters and pen scribbles on the paper and made a show about it...",1402963200,7,1309,4.16205533596838

5188498,3,B008X8L8AW,"I just got into watching these and they remind me quite a bit of Twilight Zone & Outer Limits. I don't expect a Sci-Fi show with original stories each week to have the absolute best effects or acting, but some of the episodes are a bit below standards. I would of course love to see some animated episodes based on the old school Richard Corben 'Den' stories for example. That Endomorph rabbit for example WTH!?! Overall I find it entertaining and I believe it will improve if the hsow survives. The opening narration/monologue has GOT to be changed. I understand the Metal Hurlant comet is the tie-in factor, as was the Loc-Nar from the 1981 movie, but it does not sound very convincing to me overall. I would leave the Hurlant comet as an unexplained tie-in, maybe just a monologue explaining how there are 'thousands of stories across thousands of universes in the chronicles of the Metal Hurlant' etc.",1401580800,,905,4.69811320754717

5188502,4,B008X8L8AW,"Metal Hurlant is like the Twilight Zone but with the dialogue written by non-native English speakers. And with a much more heavy Fantasy and Sci-Fi presence.

Each episode takes place in a different location with different characters. The only common link is the ""Metal Hurlant"" comet that appears at the very beginning of each story. Its origins are explained in the opening credits, but it is basically a portent and harbinger of misery and misfortune.

I was pleasantly surprised at some of the plot twists in these episodes. A number of 'Did not see that coming!' moments.
If you like Twilight Zone-type shows or just generally love Sci-Fi (like me), I would recommend it.

That being said; the dialogue, at times, can be a little... off. They get the message across, but it's painfully obvious that the writer's first language was not English. (I don't know that for a fact but it seems likely)",1401235200,,899,4.824675324675325

I can't believe Corben signed off on letting his name be used here. The plot is a basic rehash of an old Heavy Metal short story, (changed just enough to stave off a possible plagiarism suit, no doubt).

The story deals several men in a village fighting to the death to become the next king because the present king is dying. The cgi effects look terrible. The fight scenes didn't look too bad but it would have been nice to see all the combatants fight it out instead of just 2 fights.

On the plus side, the cinematography wasn't too bad. Syfy put at least a few bucks into production. There's a little twist at the end that suggests the storyline might have been interesting as it unfolded. Unfortunately, I just couldn't get past  the awful screen writing. This is another case of syfy letting someone right out of screen writing school take a whack at an original series. With amateurish exposition (characters giving long speeches to save the writer the trouble of ""showing, not telling"" the history and direction of the story), flowery cheesy dialog that leaves you asking your TV, ""who talks like that,"" and more than a little bad acting, it's a wonder there are more episodes to come.

5188523,1,B008X8L8AW,"It was nice to see some mortal combat peeps, but this had to be the worst crap ever. If this was a joke for some money laundering, that is one thing, but having it on Amazon is just SAD.",1398729600,,186,3.7948717948717947
5188524,3,B008X8L8AW,"I've watched 3 or 4 episodes of the Metal Hurlant Chronicles, and the first thing to note is that (so far) none of the episodes have anything to do with any of the other episodes. Each is a self-contained 30 minute sci-fi show. Each show takes place in its own little world/universe, and each has an interesting plot twist at the end. This formula reminds me of the old Twilight Zone series.

The only thing tying the episodes together is that at some point an asteroid, the Metal Hurlant, makes an appearance.

So far, all of the episodes have a bit of a dark ending. I think that is what has kept me from giving it a 4 star rating. I don't mind dark, but I'd like to see some upbeat episodes too. I don't think that is going to happen.

Apparently this series can trace its roots back to a comic that also inspired the 1981 animated movie ""Heavy Metal"". From what I've seen so far, however, Metal Hurlant Chronicles avoids the heavy erotic elements of ""Heavy Metal"".",1398729600,5,968,4.396648044692737
5188525,1,B008X8L8AW,Awful acting and terrible special effects. I have seen Fan films that are better...unless this is some attempt to resurrect the sci-fi films of the 60's?,1398729600,,153,4.923076923076923
5188526,1,B008X8L8AW,"Once again the SyFy channel produces a TV series with terrible, hammy, acting and even weaker stories. The props and costumes are tacky and the set visualizations are amateur-hour at a high school drama class. I can't find a single good thing to say about this series, and that's sad because, as TV goes, the ""SciFi"" channel used to be the only hope in town ... then the science-challenged pencil pushers bought it and made it into the ""SyFy"" channel. This rubbish is what you get.",1398643200,5,481,4.604651162790698
5188527,5,B008X8L8AW,"I never read the comics, and although I enjoy fight scenes, I'm not critical of them.  I only started watching this because James Marsters is in two episodes, and I make an effort to sample everything he does.  That said, I have watched and enjoyed all of the episodes so far.  Yes, the fight scenes could have been a bit more realistic, but from what I understand, this was live-action filming, not the type where stunt people do the painful stuff, then they dub in the stars for close-ups.  That means that they have to choose actors who can both act AND perform their own stunts.  That's a bit trickier than Hollywood's style of treating stars with kid gloves and practically covering them in bubble wrap, and means you may get some actors who are fabulous with physical stuff but not quite as believable with dialogue.  Again, I've enjoyed every episode...and James Marsters is amazing, as always.",1398643200,3,901,4.707006369426751
5188528,2,B008X8L8AW,"I'll admit it, I was excited to hear that Metal Hurlant (Heavy Metal) was coming to the small screen. However I had no expectations and even less hope when I learned it would be on the sci-fi channel. Anyone who has read a Heavy Metal magazine knows it shouldn't be on sci-fi; it should be on HBO. This should be filled with tons of violence, gore, language, nudity, etc. In other words Game of Thrones but with more sci-fi stuff.

That being said. Two stars is generous to be honest. This episode (at least) suffers from terrible dialogue, action sequences, and  timing and editing. Granted they had a lot to squeeze into a 22 minutes segment. But still, they couldn't cut out some excess fat? Like establishing shots for example. The episode also suffers visually everything is to clean. It's like looking at an episode of Hercules before they realized they could afford mud. For men, from poor and impoverished towns, fighting for the throne; these guys are remarkably hygienic. Not to mention the green screen and lighting issues. Oh and the robot(s)!!

You can tell the producers of Metal Hurlant had little to no budget. However, there have been shows in the past (even films) with little to no budget with more substance and entertainment value than this.

Maybe this show gets better. But to be honest I am not shelling out the credits to find out.

Here's hoping this show is salvageable, because I am all for some awesome sci-fi....this isn't awesome sci-fi.",1398556800,10,1468,4.741176470588235

8531677,3,B008X8L8AW,"I would watch James Marsters read the phone book. That being said, the concept of this episode is great but the execution is a bit lacking. I assume it's due to the direction, but Marsters comes off a bit flat in this (definitely not a problem he usually has in his performances - Torchwood, Buffy). I think they wanted him to read as being extremely ambiguous for obvious reasons, but it just erred a little to far into bland territory. I feel like this plot line would have also benefited from a longer format where they could have more fully explored it. There's so many ways they could have introduced doubt into the story line that would have been more effective. The actress' performance was unremarkable and she honestly seemed a bit too mature for the role.",1454371200,,765,4.591240875912408
