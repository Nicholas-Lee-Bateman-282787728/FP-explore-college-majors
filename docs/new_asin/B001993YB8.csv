3429736,5,B001993YB8,"The Facts of Life was a fantastic show, and I am very grateful that I got to ""grow up"" with the gang, facing many of the same challenges that they did.  This was one of the first series with an all-female cast, and it was solid--the cast, the acting, the plots, the lessons learned--everything.

Season 4 is the season in which the series really seemed to come into its own.  Blair and Jo's relationship really matured past the slapstick comedy/stereotypical right side vs. wrong side of the tracks.  They were there for each other, despite their differences, and this friendship was inspiring.  This was the season we really got to see all of the girls grow.  Blair and Jo were facing adult life and choices beyond high school and Eastland.  Tootie and Natalie, although younger, had their own challenges...plus that of seeing two of their best friends about to leave.

And, of course, Mrs. Garrett was the lovable glue that held it altogether.  Charlotte Rae did a wonderful job in this role, and Season 4 showcases some of her best stuff.

Sony really did itself a disservice by releasing Seasons 1 & 2 and then Season 3 so quickly and then just stopping.  I know there is an audience out there that loves this show and would buy all of the DVDs in a heartbeat.  The first two releases proved that point.  Why is Sony dragging its feet now?  Especially given that Season 4 is one of the strongest seasons of this groundbreaking, record-breaking, and award-winning show?

Give us what we want now, Sony.  You'll be the happy ones in the end.",1221004800,5,1543,4.617647058823529
3429737,5,B001993YB8,"This television series came on at JUST the right time as I was growing up.  It dealt seriously with many of the issues that young people go through and how to deal with them.  As I watched the series (and sometimes my mother did too as it was important to me), I felt that the charachters understood what I was going through and Mrs. Garrett was talking to me just as easily as she was to them.  I also liked how the all recognized their talents and managed to work together despite the very different backgrounds.  Of course not all the situations are the same now as they were then, but the feelings are and the consequences are too.

Now I can share these series with my daughter as she too will go through peer pressure to do this activity, wear those specific jeans, or go only to this store.  I hope that this show will help to give her the confidence that it gave me so Sony--PLEASE RELEASE THE REST OF THIS SERIES!!!",1218931200,8,924,4.281609195402299
3429738,5,B001993YB8,"The Facts of Life was my favorite show of all-time.  I taped most episodes off Nick-at-Nite and Hallmark, but that was years ago and the episodes are edited for time.  I have the first three seasons on DVD and have been waiting soooooooooooo long for the rest of the seasons.  Why isn't Sony releasing them?",1218844800,6,307,4.545454545454546
3429739,5,B001993YB8,"""The Facts of Life"" was one of my very favorite shows growing up (it was right up there with ""Diff'rent Strokes."") Season 4 is one of the very best, if not the best. All of the eps are funny and well thought-out and always include very real life-affirming lessons that are still important more than 25 years later.

It's hard to say who my favorite character on TFoL was. Perhaps Blair (Lisa Whelchel) because she was so self-centered and funny. Jo (Nancy McKeon) and Blair were great to watch together because they were the total yin and yang. They were the complete opposite of each other. And that's another reason why I love ""The Facts of Life"" because it showed a group of 4 girls working together and puting their differences aside while they opened their minds and learned to be a family in a way.

Mrs. Garret (Charlotte Rae) totally rocked. She was everything to the girls, almost like a parent and a friend, a listener and even a stern disciplinarian. And Natalie (Mindy Cohn) and Tootie (Kim Fields) were the perfect addition to this ensemble cast. They didn't take away from the others, instead they added to an already perfect show (if that's possible.) And I loved Geri Jewell as Blair's comedienne cousin Geri.

Season 4 includes a total of 24 eps (in syndication it's 25 because the season finale was an hour-long.) IMO the most memorable eps from this season are Best Sister 1 & 2. These are the ones with Blair's sister who makes the decision to become a nun, played by everyone's favorite middle-child Eve Plumb. You may remember, when things get especially heated with, Jo actually gave Blair a nice clock in the face on the second part of the ep.

BTW if you're a fan of ""The Facts of Life"" you can still catch it on Comcast's Tube Time as well as online @ tv dot com. ...Remember, you'll avoid a lot of damages, and enjoy the fun of managing the facts of life.",1216771200,6,1882,4.510263929618769
3429740,5,B001993YB8,"I bought Season 1 as a casual purchase at Target. I didn't even know it was out. Then, I went looking for Season 3 a few months later and was so impressed that I grabbed it. Now, no sign of Season 4. Is it in the works or not coming out at all? I'm surprised because it's getting close to 2 years now. Bring on Seasons 4, 5 & 6!!! I want to see Edna's Edibles!!!",1215561600,4,362,3.776315789473684
3429741,5,B001993YB8,"This show is a classic and I have been patiently waiting forever for Season 4-----please SONY, release it soon.  The waiting time is getting ridiculous.  I'll start a petition if I have to!!!!!!!",1215129600,16,195,4.878787878787879
3429742,5,B001993YB8,"I've always hated sony as a company. Just type ""sony rootkit virus"" into a google search and you'll see what kind of company they are. The fact that they STILL have not released season four of facts of life or even season three of diff'rent strokes, is pathetic to say the least! But then imagine the horror of those waiting for season three of T.J. Hooker (coming up on the FIVE year mark). Another fine example of Sony wisdom; they released ONE season of ""Riptide"" and stopped. Canadian company VEI got the rights and released the entire series within a single YEAR. Three cheers for VEI for making Sony look like the clowns that they truly are! A shame VEI can't get the rights to Facts and Diff'rent Strokes.

They should really just release the ENTIRE series of Fact of Life and Diff'rent strokes, ALL AT ONCE.... in a low cost package like the Sanford and Son and Good Times releases. The packaging may not be great, but at least the ENTIRE series is released AT ONCE and we don't have to put up with the horror that is SONY.

3429744,5,B001993YB8,"Dear Sony,

Many of us have faithfully bought all the previously released seasons of ""The Facts of Life.""  We have been waiting patiently for over a year now while you guys have forgotten us because of your financially-driven zest to release currently syndicated 'classics' like ""Two and a Half Men"" (either that, or you've been sitting in the corner eating boogers). Don't get me wrong - most of us who loved the ""Facts"" girls back in the day are happy that fellow 80s star Jon Cryer has a steady job, but, honestly, give us our ""Facts.""

NOW!!!!!

Luckily, if you grew up in the 80s loving this show, you will be in for a treat. The first 6 seasons of ""The Facts of Life"" are what made the show. Season four keeps the laughs coming.

3429813,4,B001993YB8,"FACTS OF LIFE was a popular sitcom that was a spinoff of DIFF'RENT STROKES pertaining to the Drummond's former maid Mrs. Edna Garrett(Charlotte Rae)who now works as the housemother of a dormitory at an all-girls only private school called Eastland School in Peekskill, New York and the series ran on NBC from Friday August 24, 1979 to Saturday May 7, 1988 throughout its whole 9-year run.

The girls who were under Mrs. Garrett's care were spoiled rich girl Blair Warner(Lisa Whelchel), the tough, but streetwise Jo Polniaczek(Nancy McKeon), the overweight, but impressionable Natalie Green(Mindy Cohn), and the youngest, but gossipy Dorothy ""Tootie"" Ramsay(Kim Fields).

This 1982-83 Season was awesome and is the season when Blair and Jo graduate from Eastland Academy in the Spring of 1983 when THE FACTS OF LIFE ranked 5th among prime-time shows.

Unfortunately THE FACTS OF LIFE wasn't originally a ratings winner on Friday nights when it debuted in the Summer of 1979 or even in its second tryout in the Spring of 1980 either since it only ranked #74 out of 79 shows on the air in the year-end Nielsen ratings and was NBC's lowest-rated series for a while and didn't flourish till it hits its 2nd Season in the Fall of 1980 when the show was retooled and moved to Wednesdays ranking at a respectably moderate #26 in the ratings and was NBC's 4th highest-rated scripted series after LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE, THE FACTS OF LIFE'S parent series(DIFF'RENT STROKES), and CHiPs.

From there on, THE FACTS OF LIFE had continued to rank in the mid-and upper-20's in the Nielsen ratings for nearly every season until NBC kicked off its 7th Season(1985-86 Season)when it was moved to Saturdays, but its timeslot change decreased its ratings from #31 in 1986-87 and then down to #37 in its 1987-88 Season before NBC cancelled THE FACTS OF LIFE in the Summer of 1988.

This 1982-1983 Season of THE FACTS OF LIFE also take me back to memory lane to when NBC's motto was ""Just Watch Us Now"" and to when I used to watch this show every Wednesday night at 9PM before watching FAMILY TIES at 9:30 PM and to when Ronald Reagan was the president and when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982.",1345075200,2,2227,4.744186046511628

3429829,3,B001993YB8,"This is the stupidest movie ever! It has the corniest lines, and the characters are so annoying you want to smack them. Jo was the most realistic character in this movie, but even HER story got stupid when she got out of character, going off with some stupid boy she just met instead of going to some famous car race she REALLY REALLY REALLY wanted to go to. UGH. totally out of character for her and a totally stupid storyline.

Tootie and Natalie pester an annoying writer who learns to love them and decides to dedicate his book to the two girls, in a very corny scene with the most corny lines. that particular plot line NOT REALISTIC AT ALL.

Blair's man chasing also gets stupid.

the movie is also very LONG and very SLOW and there's NOT MUCH PLOT.

this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen!

the other episodes had BETTER be good.",1289606400,,844,4.350318471337579
3429830,5,B001993YB8,"I grew up on THE FACTS OF LIFE and was thrilled when they announced the release of season 4.  Not only was it the best season with the girls more matured and dealing with heavier issues, but we also have the very well done and emotional graduation of Jo and Blair from the Eastland Academy For Girls.  This was dealt with in two parts and was lovingly handled with great care for fans.  It was very believable that Jo and Blair had grown into young women, formed a special bond and we see how all this realistically affected all four of our girls.

The most important part of this boxed set is the inclusion of the tv movie special THE FACTS OF LIFE GOES TO PARIS.  This was presented as a special weeks before season four started and received huge ratings.  It was superbly written.  Usually when tv series had movies like this they turned into slapstick silly ventures.  Here we got journeys of self exploration of all the girls including Mrs. Garrett which helped greatly to show how they had grown up when the new season premiered.  This special could easily have been sold as a separate dvd but to include such a huge special feature deserves the highest kudos.

Stories on THE FACTS OF LIFE always dealt with serious and timely issues and that continues here.  Blair dates and tries to change a retarded young man.  Jo deals with possibly having to leave Eastland due to the loss of her scholarship.  I can go on and on about the plots but they were all great and displayed how our girls had blossomed.  And holding it all together as always is Charlotte Rae as Mrs. Garrett.  She was always the shining light of this show bringing some light slapstick while bringing wisdom to all the girls.  If you grew up on this show this is the best season to have.  Memories galore on a show that lives on in our hearts.",1286582400,4,1816,4.421686746987952
3429831,4,B001993YB8,"Once again it's Shout! Factory to the rescue.  When Sony suddenly lost interest in THE FACTS OF LIFE following the release of Season Three, fans were left wondering if we'd ever see the continuing stories of the Eastland gang.  After all, Season Four-onwards is where the show really picks up the pace!  Not to worry now, with Shout! Factory seeming to be firmly committed in seeing the rest of the sets released in a more timely fashion (Season Five is poised for a November street-date as I'm writing this review).

Not only do we get all 24 episodes from Season Four, but also the complete THE FACTS OF LIFE GOES TO PARIS special!  This four-episode, movie-length story originally aired before Season Four kicked off in 1982.  Mrs. Garrett (Charlotte Rae) and the girls enjoy a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to travel to Paris, where Mrs. G. is enrolled in an exclusive cookery seminar.  The girls are meant to be studying at a summer boarding-school but manage to break away for their own adventures.  Jo (Nancy McKeon) finds unexpected romance with a dreamy French boy.  Blair (Lisa Whelchel) sets out with similar plans but has her ideal vacation by instead letting down her guard and living in the ""moment""; whilst Tootie and Natalie befriend an American author with writer's block.

Season Four of THE FACTS OF LIFE brings more drama and expectations for the girls, Blair and Jo especially.  It's their last year at Eastland and the pressures start to take their toll.  Jo's days at the Academy could be numbered when her scholarship is cut off - and the only possible way that she could stay would be to accept a grant from Warner Industries - Blair's company!  Tootie (Kim Fields) must grapple with a hearing problem; and Natalie (Mindy Cohn) faces the opportunity to meet her birth mother.  Keep 'em coming, Shout!

As I watched each Disc, in order, It was like I was a child, growing up with the girls, all over again.  I really haven't much to complain about, as I'm just thrilled to have this certain collection.  However, I must point out a couple of things.  1. The Transfer of THE FACTS OF LIFE GOES TO PARIS, wasn't all that wonderful.  You'd think with the technology that we have, today, that they (the studio) could have cleaned up the grainy picture a LOT more than what they did.  Then, 2. I noticed during a couple of the episodes, the color changed from frame-to-frame.  The color of the girls' uniforms would go from dark red to a brighter red and then back again.

3429849,5,B001993YB8,I am very glad to have to this on DVD. It has been over 3 years since season 3 was released. Some of the episodes in this season are kind of sad and really deal with the facts of life. This is really the last season to really show these life lessons the last 5 seasons were really nothing but good humor. I hope season 5 comes on DVD soon.

I already own the first three seasons (though the first season could have been left out as far as I'm concerned). So many other shows that didn't have half the following of FoL have been released on DVD.  I'll never understand what has taken Sony so long to release this TV hit.  The seasons just keep getting better as the show progressed so they better not stop at season four!,1265587200,2,591,4.435185185185185

3429860,5,B001993YB8,"It has been nearly four years since Sony Pictures have released The Facts of Life: The Complete Third Season on DVD. Today, January 26, 2010, Shout! Factory has announced the next installment: The Facts of Life: The Complete Fourth Season to be released May 4th, 2010 on DVD. Not only does the 4 disc set contain all 23 full length episodes, but one of the special features will include The Facts of Life: Goes To Paris 2 Hour Movie, which, was aired on NBC only days before the fourth season premiered in the fall of 1982.

This marks the last season of the show at Private School Eastland Academy, where the 1983-1984 season starts the beginning of a new era for the show: Edna's Edibles. But let's not get ahead of ourselves just yet. Guest Stars for the fourth season include Eve Plumb (Brady Bunch), Jimmy Baio, David Ackroyd, Gary Hudson, Geri Jewell, Chip Fields (Kim Fields 'Tooties' mother). Mrs. Garrett and the girls learn more about the Facts of Life during Blair and Jo's senior year at Eastland. The season finale featured a double-length episode where Blair and Jo graduate Eastland Academy only to enroll in Langley College in near Peekskill, New York. This season also marks a memorable episodes where Natalie wears her infamous lightning bolt hat in the pillow fight episode, Take My Finals Please!

These episodes are great, the first couple seasons seemed not to quite find it's niche and the writing was very 'cheesy'. As the girls grow up, the subject matter also tends to mature. It just get's better from here on.

Within 2 days, we were out buying Season 3.  She is so frustrated waiting for more episodes to arrive.

As I look at all the crappy TV DVD series that are out, I am just shocked that Sony isn't jumping in there to get the rest of these on the shelves!

I would much rather pay $25 for a Season of TFoL than $25 to see the lousy story-line movies that are in the theaters right now.

3429894,5,B001993YB8,"I suppose the reason Sony hasn't released additional seasons of ""Facts"" is probably purely monetary.  People are holding onto whatever discretionary cash they may have -- what little of it there still is -- instead of buying more of anything these days.  But DVD sets are still a good value for the money, especially if more families are staying home huddled around their TV sets looking for a bit of comic relief.  Family-friendly shows aren't just a dying breed anymore -- they've already gone the way of the dinosaur -- and many parents are happy to shell out for shows like this that can be counted on to entertain without having to be edited and/or bleeped for content.  For those of us patiently waiting for Sony to deliver, I hope it will be sooner rather than later.",1224806400,3,774,4.627737226277373
