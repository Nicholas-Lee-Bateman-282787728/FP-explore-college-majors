Caveat: Of concern here is the tape's manufacturer, MADACY. This outfit produced low-grade SLP mode transfers that had tracking problems in some machines. No high quality VHS editions are available.

8034095,4,B0002XCCXI,"This smoothly paced English made work has many advantages going: capable direction that includes thoroughgoing competence with editing processes, a talented internationally flavoured cast, striking settings, of which many are in Paris and along the French Riviera, a comedic yet accessible screenplay, and top-flight design of costumes and interiors for each scene.  Beautiful Annabella has top billing as Ranie Racine whose financier father, despite his ostensible suicide, has to her mind been murdered, and in an attempt to determine the actual cause of her sire's death, Ranie links up with Paul de Brack, a British government agent seeking identical information (David Niven with his initial starring part in a major feature), the two formulating various undercover ploys during which they come upon a large banking scandal while, naturally, facing the pleasant bother of falling in love.  Elegance is the keynote of the film, with the gowns and other costuming of Ren Hubert being specially effective in its fostering, while a Monte Carlo casino, a luxurious Mediterranean yacht belonging to a probable principal in the mentioned scandal, in addition to concordant venues, are harmoniously complemented by the breezy dialogue penned by Roland Pertwee with additions from Romney Brent who also plays as a journalist following along the same trail as are Ranie and Paul.  From the cast come numerous fine performances, Annabella earning acting honours for her vivid turn as an amateur detective, and there are telling contributions from Francis L. Sullivan and Tyrell Davis, representatives of the Forces of Evil, Shakespearian player William Dewhurst as an enigmatic jeweller who aids Ranie with adornment for her disguises, radiant Nora Swinburne, who not surprisingly steals her two brief scenes and, ever at ease among the elite, Niven may not be overlooked in this pleasant cinematic souffl.",1125100800,2,1900,5.45578231292517
