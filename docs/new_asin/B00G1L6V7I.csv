8620094,2,B00G1L6V7I,"Lee Strasberg and Ruth Gordon are two of my favorite actors. I put off ordering this movie for a long time because of the relatively high cost, and I couldn't wait to watch it once I received it. I don't know that I have ever been more disappointed in a movie. (Not that it was the actors' faults; I blame it on the writer and director -- written by Stephen Verona and Leigh Chapman and directed by Verona.) It was so poorly written and so trite, no actors could have done anything with that script. And only a director who wrote the script could have let it pass without a major rewrite. I know it has received good reviews so far, but don't let the great cast and touching subject matter fool you. It's a stinker.",1430438400,,715,4.264705882352941
8620095,5,B00G1L6V7I,A great touching movie with a marvelous performance by Lee Strassberg and Ruth Gordon. This movie is never shown on television.,1430352000,,127,5.095238095238095
8620096,5,B00G1L6V7I,"This film has to be seen to be believed, more talent in one film than you would ever hope for.  Lee Strasberg, Ruth GOrdon, and Janet Leigh in Coney Island dealing with 70's changing racial paterns, a street gang, and personal health issues and age.  Starts out light, and opens your heart to what must be the greatest couple on film celebrating their 50th in a world where hatred is not hidden.  In my top three movies of all time.",1408752000,,432,4.375
8620097,5,B00G1L6V7I,"This movie was a unintended look into the future of America.  We see this blatant disregard for authority or other people, the elderly, etc. - today among criminals, and even kids.  We see more and more gangs taking over our neighborhoods with a government turning a blind eye and making excuses thanks to political correctness.  The disease of evil is spreading like cancer.  More and more kids turning to a life of violence thanks to psychotropic drug use issued by doctors and parents.  Besides the illegal drugs pouring over the borders in an unstoppable gravy train of death.  The downfall of our country is upon us.  It started to get bad in the 1960's, between race baitors using the race card to divide, the influx of drugs and the use thereof by acceptance through music such as the beatles.  The broken traditional family unit.  All leads to dysfunction and godless behaviors.  You can find the common denominator very easily.  Just look at the changes made by progressive leftists over the decades.  A slow but strong undermining of goodness that once made America great, safe, prosperous and pleasant to live in years ago.  We are headed now for a wasteland of MadMax proportions unless the mistakes are corrected.  Evil is a cancer.  And it only succeeds when the Good do nothing.  This movie precisely predicts and shows what happens to communities when criminals are not punished but the peaceable citizens are the target instead of more redundant silly laws that do nothing to stop crime.  We need criminal control, psychotropic drugs halted, home schooling and the borders sealed once and for all to truly solve America's out of control criminal behaviors wrecking our lives !!!",1402531200,,1695,4.911971830985915
8620098,2,B00G1L6V7I,"A museum piece of an era in ethnic assertions of territory
Great piece of nostalgia for Brooklyn and some lovely moments from
Strasberg, but over the top heavy handed directing, offensive
stereotypes, and uneven acting throughout.",1398816000,,230,5.416666666666667
8620099,4,B00G1L6V7I,"Boardwalk stars Lee Strasberg and Ruth Gordon as David and Becky Rosen, who have lived in the same Coney Island neighborhood for nearly all their married life. Ruth Gordon has said this performance is her favorite movie role.

As their 50th wedding anniversary approaches, the area has changed for the worse and a gang leader named Strut (Kim Delgado) has decided to make Coney Island his new turf. Strut begins shaking down merchants, demanding payment for protection and using violence to deal with anyone who gets in his way. David refuses to give Strut protection money. His diner is soon firebombed, while many of his neighbors are attacked and his synagogue is desecrated. Janet Leigh plays their daughter Florence, who is planning to marry more for security than for love.

The movie covers several themes  old age, urban blight, the generation gap, terminal illness, and the American Dream. Director Stephen Verona has elicited first-rate performances. The supporting cast includes 1930s actress and singer Lillian Roth, songwriter Sammy Cahn, and longtime deep-voiced character actor Joe Silver. There are no bonus extras on the DVD release.",1395446400,5,1150,5.239130434782608
8620100,3,B00G1L6V7I,"Despite the A-list of actors in the cast (Actors Studio founder Lee Strasberg, veteran actress Ruth Gordon and Psychos lead actress Janet Leigh, you probably have never heard of this film, now making its DVD and Bluray debut. Thats because this 1979 indie (before indie was a designation for a low budget art film) was only the 3rd or fourth film written and directed by Stephen Verona. The only other Verona film you may be familiar with  at least it was the only one I knew  is The Lords of Flatbush, a film about gangs in Brooklyn, best known for the first film to star Henry Winkler after he became The Fonz on TVs Happy Days. This film takes place in Brooklyn too, specifically the Jewish section of Coney Island (hence the boardwalk in the title. It was films on location and uses a lot of hand-held camera work.

The plot revolves around an elderly Jewish couple (Strasberg owns a cafeteria; Gordon gives piano lessons at home) who are a dying breed (no pun intended) as their fellow synagogue congregants and friends leave the city because of crime and gangs. At the same time their daughter (Leigh) is looking for love in middle age (she is either divorced or widowed) and Leighs 20ish son want to be a  pop songwriter and musician. And to add to the icons in the cast list there are both composer/lyricist Sammy Cahn and veteran actress Lillian Roth (whose life was the basis for the film Ill Cry Tomorrow). Both have very small parts.

I won't give any spoilers here  I don't like them either  but I will say that the gang of minorities do prey on them. And since this is the late 70s the soundtrack lets you know when they are coming. Cue the bongos! (And yes there are lots of bongo moments  in the films 100 minutes). The film LOOKS like a 70s film too!

 Much of the movie is slow and Leigh may be giving her weakest performance ever. Strasberg is playing the elderly Jewish man he was at that time and Gordon (who was 83 at the time; Strasberg was younger at only 78) plays old but wise as she always did in her later years.

The ending is  frankly  nonsensical, though to make it different, Verona would have had to make the film longer and  at least for me  it was too long for this period story already.

I know there are lots of folks who have been looking for this film for years and, for them, its now available. But for me, its dated and I can only say Its Okay. Hence the three stars.

No bonuses on either the DVD or BD though both come with chapter stops and subtitles.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
