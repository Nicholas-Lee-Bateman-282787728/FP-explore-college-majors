Point blank: it is a fantastic, highly-entertaining film from several standpoints. Engrossing and hard-to-predict plot, some superb acting, great ending, relevance (War on Terror aspect).

Sure it has some holes...[MEGA SPOILER]
- What if one of the ""candidates"" needed to use the bathroom during the elimination? I assume there are no bathroom breaks.
- Why does America need suicide bombers when it has hi-tech, long-range guided missles??

Overall though, highly recommended.  I WILL purchase a DVD.",1255564800,4,558,5.453488372093023
3904079,4,B002C6VMKW,"A movie as spare as the clinically white room in which most of the action takes place, THE KILLING ROOM is tightly wound and highly entertaining. Shot in a slightly monochromatic, gritty visual style the film introduces a room of strangers gathered together to participate in a medical experiment for cash--or so they think. What unfolds is part SAW, part THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, and just a tiny bit Jason Bourne and the video game PORTAL. Movies that focus on the 'what would you do to survive' motif are hardly new and usually fail because they are rehashes of old material or because they are simply too gross. THE KILLING ROOM is able to walk the fine line between ruthlessness and psychological tension coupled with a strange believability that really drives it all home.

The director Jonathan Liebesman has also wisely chosen to let the audience watch the action from both the killing room as well as from behind the scenes, all through the eyes of the very well acted Ms. Reilly (Chlo Sevigny). Ms. Reilly (without giving away too much of the plot) is introduced very early on as interviewing for a position with a government agency that tests the bounds of human psychology. The stress of this interview and its effects on her as well as her very subtle facial expressions are convincing. I found her character to be the most interesting in this sparsely populated movie.

There are several nicely constructed scenes that are well acted. In particular are the interactions between Ms. Reilly and Dr. Phillips her interviewer early in the film. There is a quiet menace lurking in the dialogue that is frequently more palpably frightening than the main action taking place below them behind bullet-proof glass. Other excellent moments include the final reveal--which delivers an unexpected surprise, one that I did not see coming.

There are a few key weaknesses to the film. Chief among them are the overuse of narrative voice masquerading as radio traffic. Much is told instead of shown through these, and by the end of the film I was quite tired of anonymous video game voices filing in the gaps. Another weak area is in some of the predictability of the plot. However, that is offset by the fantastic reveal at the end of the film which as I said, is quite unexpected.

Overall THE KILLING ROOM succeeds because it doesn't bite off more than it can chew. The set is very controlled and basic, the characters are left as cardboard cut-outs (which in a film like this is virtue) and the entire film is handled in a removed and emotionless fashion that is perfect for making the main points of the film. The film style is stylized documentary with frequent hand camera shots mixed with menacing angle shots and close ups that keep the viewer both engaged and properly distanced throughout. Liebesman has cut the film  to a short 93 minutes; just the right length for his subject matter.

3.5/5 Stars. Well made, boldly ruthless, and delivers a well done final reveal.",1251763200,21,2977,4.8046875

3904081,3,B002C6VMKW,"This movie is fun because the characters DON'T have depth.  The whole point is to try and figure out which psychological profile is the one that they are trying to find for candidacy in their program.  It was entertaining, and had a nice twist at the end that outdid Shyamalan's usual plot twist fare. Citizen Kane it is not, but I don't see the point in comparing this movie to the Usual Suspects.  Apples and oranges and all that.  Its more like a less gory Saw (the first one).  And way to throw out the spoiler in the review, Buzz Killington.

3904082,1,B002C6VMKW,"Imagine agreeing to participate in a harmless experiment only to find that it isn't at all what you thought. Well, one lady and 3 guys agree to and find themselves in more trouble than they could ever imagine. While on the surface, they should be suspicious, the promise of $25 dollars an hour proves to be more of a lure than a deterrent. So we are not surprised that after being escorted into a sterile looking white room, given a survey to complete, their personal possessions  taken, and then being locked in a room, that the participants begin to see that maybe they have made a mistake. A young eager female profiler has been picked to observe and analyze those things that break people psychologically. Apparently this program's sole goal is to create people who will be suicide bombers for the government. So when the main examiner, shoots the female participant and challenges the remaining/surviving participants to answer questions to save their lives, they find that what was a sure thing, may not be. What will break them and who will eventually be deemed worthy will not surprise you, but the utter lack of depth in the characters will definitely disappoint. What could have worked and really been a decent movie, failed because it did not execute. I wouldn't recommend this movie if you want something truly suspenseful. Instead rent some oldie but goodies like ""The Usual Suspects"", ""Identity"" or something with some real grit.

Japan
Director: Jonathan Liebesman
Writers: Gus Krieger & Ann Peacock - screenplay
Stars: Nick Cannon, Clea DuVall, Timothy Hutton

Exceptional thriller.  I can't give the movie enough praise, but I have to say the story idea that the government (writers) uses to justify their study is laughable (see Spoiler) in the real world.  Everything is above your average thriller here. The story is great, the directing excellent, the casting and acting super, and all the rest involved with the production are far above average.  I was glued to my seat and never quite sure what to expect.

Spoiler: The writers didn't get the fact you don't murder several people to get ""one"" person that will do your bidding when you could have had several if not all of them willing to forfeit their lifes for their country.  So in a nutshell their inability to analyze human nature lead to a waste of human resources.  If the writers did know that but ignored it, they just went for the shock value of cold blooded murder of innocent people and that makes it slightly less of a movie overall to me at least.

3904088,4,B002C6VMKW,"Psychological thrillers at their best. This movie will keep you guessing up until the last line of the movie. And that line is definately a killer. This movie reminded me of CUBE in that it relied on incredibly strong tension and group dynamics to set an unnerving mood throughout the entire movie. The cast did a magnificent job of bringing this story to life. If you get as into the film as my wife and I did, you will come away from this movie talking. This is one to put on the queue sooner rather than later. REALLY close to 5 stars!",1362528000,,538,4.284313725490196
3904089,5,B002C6VMKW,"**Possible Spoilers**
As a film collector & collector of films w/ Tim Hutton, this really peaked my interest. Purchasing it prior to viewing the movie, I really didn't have many doubts that I'd really enjoy it. A) I'm a fanatic of psychological thrillers, B) I collect Hutton's films, C) I absolutley LOVE Chloe Sevigny & have since ""Boys Don't Cry"" & ""American Psycho""), & C) Peter Stormare (amazing & chilling in this feature) can be either incredibly hilarious or terrifyingly evil.
I buy films w/out having viewed them quite often & have rarely been dissapointed, mainly b/c I know what I like & when certain actors/actresses appear in a genre that I love (case in point-this picture), not much can go wrong.
The running time is 93 mins, but it seems like much longer, & I mean this in the best of ways. The writing is taut, fast-paced, & quite intelligent & w/ an incredible twist-especially when Sevigny's character (Dr. Emily Reily) figures out what the real objective is to this ""experiment"". I found it even more facinating b/c ""Apoptosis"" (cells in our body that are weak sacrificing themselves so that the stronger ones can survive) is a scientific principle that I studied in college!
The directing is very fast cut w/ quick edits that work w/ the storytelling perfectly. Jon Liebesman's style is excellent for the picture. This film debuted @ the SunDance 2009 Film Festival & was quite well recieved by the critics. 1 called it "" 'CUBE' w/ a better cast!"".
Well, in any event, this is a keeper & I enjoy watching it from time to time. Any fan of the psych thriller genre, intelligent plots, great directing & casting, & storytelling that paces itself well should certainly check this film out.",1333497600,,1707,4.77027027027027

3904091,5,B002C6VMKW,"This film has three things: a solid story, great acting, and a superb setting.

I have never heard of the director before watching this, but I might have to start watching more of his films. I took a major bet on this, and boy, was I glad that I did. This film should have been a hit! I wish there was a term that I could use to describe indie films that deserve to become acclaimed (financially and critically). If there is, I can think of any at the moment.

Watch it for yourselves, have an informed opinion, and enjoy the damn movie!",1318550400,,537,4.203883495145631
3904092,3,B002C6VMKW,"This is very similar to the recently released ""The Exam."" Actually, the basic set up is the same. The difference here is that the stakes are higher. Much higher.

Here we have four people enter a testing facility. They answered and ad in the paper and all need the money the test will pay them. Tim Hutton plays one of the testees. He's done this many times before and is very comfortable with the situation. He soon finds out (as do they all) this is no regular test. It's a process of elimination with ""elimination"" being the key word.

It's hard to say more without spoiling the entire film but there is much to see here. You'll know or recognize most of the key actors. Tim Hutton, Clea Duvall (Zodiac) Chloe Sevigny (Zodiac) and Shea Wigham to name a few. Like ""The Exam"" essentially the entire movie takes place in one room. The production team does a nice job of keeping things from getting boring in there. It's shot well and the sound is decent, though I found myself having to turn things up a bit to catch all the dialogue. The acting is good and the story is very good save for one particular item, but it's a biggy.

This test is carried out for one particular purpose and I found the premise absurd. I can think of no reason we need what is being tested for. If someone who feels there is a reason for this test and wishes to comment on this review please do. I simply cannot find one. But this is why I can only give this movie three stars. It's a great idea built on a sandy foundation. This is not to say the movie isn't worth viewing. It is. And you don't get the punchline until the last few minutes so the viewing experience isn't lessened. Just know that you might want to do someone grievous bodily harm when you find out what it's all about.

3904106,1,B002C6VMKW,"Most likely what the Cube would have been had it been made in America via the artless Hollywood route.

The Killing Room is an immediate and obvious rip off of two great foreign thrillers. First many will recognize lots of stolen elements of the 1997 Canadian movie  The Cube directed by Vincenzo Natali and lots of similarities to the 2001 German movie Das Experiment (The Experiment).
Sadly the Killing Room is a watered down, depressingly American, version of those two brilliant films. Too bad the Canadians or Germans aren't big on lawsuits or this garbage would've never have been made.

When you leave a film saying Nick Cannon's talent was wasted that really says how awful that film is.

Life is short don't waste your time on this and just see The Cube or Das Experiment. Even the SAW movies, which this mess also rips off, will offer you much more.

What? People trapped in a spatial puzzle or locked maze for reasons unknown to them and they have to figure out why they are there in order to escape OR people whom volunteered for a test or experiment they know little about for reasons of personal gain only to be tested in a spatial puzzle or locked room and in order to escape alive or with a prize they have to fight each other to get out. It's may be different movies but any film student can see it is the same basic idea different but told in a different genre and different execution of that same idea. The Cube, Das Experiment, the first SAW movie, and even the recent 2009 British thriller The Exam are the same idea told in various ways that the Killing Room tells rather poorly. In fact the Exam is pretty much most similar to The Killing Room. So see the Exam for a much much much better version of this movie!",1279065600,3,2027,4.785100286532951

This movie is an excellent suspense / thriller movie.  Premise is that a small group of people are brought to a room for a ""psychological research study"".  Basically under the guise that if they participate in the questionaire they will get paid.  Things quickly go downhill from there, and soon become caught in an experiment that forces them to fight for survival  The story isn't terribly original, but it is spun in such a way that it is definately worth watching.  Also it is one of those stories that is best watched without knowing too much about it, as a large part of the movie is trying to figure out whats going on as they feed you little tid-bits of information throughout the movie.

Its not a big budget movie, so they keep things simple.  This is not to say its low budget or low quality, they did a good job of knowing what they had and managing to stay within their limits to keep things sharp looking and sounding.  The ending of the movie is definately more ""small studio"" than ""big hollywood"" as you can tell the ending is more what the director wanted rather than what the studio felt would sell best.

All in all this was a great under-the-radar suspense movie that kept me interested from the very begining until the very end.",1275609600,13,1423,4.3726235741444865
3904108,2,B002C6VMKW,"2 of 5 stars for the psychological suspense movie The Killing Room. In an odd way, this movie reminded me of the movie The Cube; though this is not a sci-fi movie. Four people sign-up for a one day ""research project"". The researchers put them into an observation chamber and start the experiment. I am not going to spoil the movie by describing the experiment or the lame reason for the experiment. The bulk of the movie was watching the subjects go thru the experiment and the last few minutes explained the ""government plot"" behind the experiment. Not a very good suspense movie. Sorry, but, I can't recommend this movie.",1264204800,2,623,4.672727272727273
3904109,3,B002C6VMKW,"Four individuals are ushered into a small room, where they are told to fill in the questionnaire they are given. They are Crawford (Timothy Hutton), Kerry (Clea DuVall), Paul (Nick Cannon) and Tony (Shea Whigham). Obviously there are no connections between these people, except that they all have volunteered for the scientific or psychological researches conducted by some institute. But one terrible thing happens and they realize that what they are asked to do is something far more difficult than they expected, including their own survival. After all, the film's title is ""The Killing Room.""

The premise of the film might remind you of some of the recently-made thrillers (like ""Cube"" and ""Das Experiment""). Part of the film's uniqueness, however, derives from its subplot (or main plot) about those who are observing the consequences of their researches. Chlo Sevigny plays a young, ambitious researcher Ms. Reilly and Peter Stormare, Dr. Phillips, her supervisor. As you see, there is a political message in the film reflecting the post 9/11 world, which you may find thought-provoking, or just absurd.

Directed by Jonathan Liebesman (""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning"" ""Darkness Falls""), ""The Killing Room"" provides enough suspense to keep you interested in the story, but perhaps you shouldn't look for coherent logics here. Also, those who are intrigued by its ""MK-ULTRA"" premise, a code name for certain governmental research program, will find that the film's story has little to do with the real-life counterpart. Well, but who knows?

The thriller has some moments, especially its ""countdown"" sequences, and the actors all turned in very good performances. ""The Killing Room"" is fairly thrilling though you just cannot ignore its obvious plot holes.",1261094400,5,1775,5.354838709677419
3904110,2,B002C6VMKW,"The Killing Room (Joanthan Liebesman, 2009)

The Killing Room is one of those movies that could have been really, really fantastic if it had been tweaked just a little bit more. Which is kind of surprising given that it was directed by Jonathan Liebesman, previoiusly responsible for such deathless cinema as Darkness Falls and Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning. Maybe this means Liebesman is finally starting to hone his chops as a director of movies that actually want to build suspense instead of splashing the screen with very unsuspenseful gore. He's still got a lot of work to do, but at least this is kind of promising. Das Experiment it is not, by any means, but it's miles better than Darkness Falls.

The plot revolves around four people who have volunteered to take place in a seemingly innocuous government experiment. They are Paul (Drumline's Nick Cannon), Kerry (Identity's Clea DuVall), Crawford (Brief Interviews with Hideous Men's Timothy Hutton), and Tony (Splinter's Shea Whigham, whom I think I've seen in at elast five movies in the past three months). Monitoring the experiment are longtime government official Dr. Phillips (Bruiser's Peter Stormare) and his brand new assistant Ms. Reilly (American Psycho's Chloe Sevigny). Everything starts off nice and simple, but Phillips throws a monkeywrench into the works almost immediately, and Reilly finds herself questioning everything she thought she knew about the ethics of psychology as the experiment progresses.

This is another one of those movies (like The Death Factory Bloodletting, above) where the screenwriters, in this case Gus Krieger (his first work) and Ann Peacock (Kit Kittredge: An American Girl), put together a cast of characters who seem tailor-made for this sort of thing, and then do very little with the results. The relationship between Paul and Tony, for example, ricochets back and forth between animosity and soulmate without any real reasoning, and Reilly's qualms, though we get a depiction of them now and again, don't really seem to be based on any deep-seated personality traits. (This makes one of the big plot twists towards the end of the film simultaneously predictable and disappointing; you know it's going to happen, and you want to throw popcorn at Liebesman for making the fact that it's going to happen so obvious.) For what it's worth, if you take out the character development factor, it's not an awful script, but how can you take out the character development factor when you compare it to the movie's obvious father figure, Das Experiment? That one has everything this one does, but the strength of Hirschbiegel's characters makes it a much more satisfying exercise in tension.

Worth seeing if you're a fan of one of the principals, but ultimately just a way to waste an hour and a half while waiting for something better to come on. **",1260489600,5,2861,5.080851063829787

That way you can understand all of the raido chatter. The chatter is a character in itself and is not filler at all. Seriously, this film deserved an Oscar. Definitely a textbook sleeper hit. Peter Stormare has never been more diabolical. When you find out what the purpose of his MK ULTRA program is you will understand what I mean. This is a true horror film with flawless acting that is better than most and shoud not be missed.",1468713600,2,585,4.528301886792453
