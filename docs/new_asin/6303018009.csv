547538,1,6303018009,"Let me see.  Where do I start.  When you receive a VHS that you paid over AUS$20 for, and you received it and you find a $0.49 sticker on it from Goodwill, what would you think.  This seller obviously is a total ripoff merchant and I will NEVER deal with them again.  I blame myself totally (but caveat emptor)",1286409600,,310,4.203389830508475
547539,4,6303018009,"I've been lumbered into enjoying this!
It's a strange production- though I was aware it would be being already somewhat familiar with the show- Little Chap (Tony Tanner) and Evie/Anya/Ara/Genie (Millicent Martin) are both charming, talented, and really drive this production to make it memorable and well worth seeing.
I feel like the ensemble, and the two daughters, however, are rather bland and not very talented singers, which is a shame.

The songs are lovely, the message- a bit of a downer-, but this has songs you need to listen to, and is a very strong musical.
Yes, the production is strange, especially to those of you not used to theatre and whose only exposure to musicals is Chicago, Moulin Rouge and Disney Films... But go in with an open mind, and you'll find some beautiful, interesting, and funny songs that beckon to be listened to again and again.",1261180800,4,867,4.818791946308725
547540,1,6303018009,"I was disappointed with this release.  I was looking for a 1996 version that starred Peter Scolari and Stephanie Zimbalist.  Saw it on t.v. once and loved it,  but, can't find a copy anywhere.",1016496000,4,192,4.588235294117647

7836270,5,6303018009,"this was nice, When movies used to entertain us with simplicity and raw talent. This has some of the greatest songs in theater history that I hadn't heard in years. I know I'll re-watch it many times to come.",1488412800,,208,4.358974358974359

7836272,5,6303018009,My wife Millicent Martin stars in it with Tony Tanner.  Of course it gets 5 stars,1482624000,,81,4.0625
7836273,5,6303018009,"I've had the OBC recording since it came out and loved the songs.  That's why I bought the show (this DVD). One of almost no shows in which every song is great.  One song (""I believed it all didn't you?"") was only sung quietly during the bows. It's as good and poignant as any song in the show.  I've only heard it sung by Carol Burnett.  I watched it twice (yesterday and just now).  The German girl's piece is not in this.  That's why I watched it twice, to see whether somehow I'd missed or forgotten it.  And the Oriental girl's part that's in the flick is not on the obc album.  Bits and pieces (which were NOT unimportant) were abbreviated, cut.  Also I think this version aimed for sentiment, while the original was satire. ""Why did someone nice..."" is changed.  In the original it goes ""But who wants Freud's advice/ I'm sure it works with mice/But not with someone nice like you.""  And I nearly died when the credits named two guys who had added material.  This flick is only 96 minutes. That's VERY short for a stage show. But how could it have been longer?

Tony Tanner had a fantastic voice, particularly for a stage show.  And his facial expressions and grimaces were great.  I saw Millicent Martin in a couple Noel Coward shows and liked her so much I nearly cheered when I found this DVD with her.

I wish more great shows were filmed at performances like this one.  And as a flick, it had no flaws.  Great sound, picture.",1477699200,4,1437,4.378787878787879
7836274,1,6303018009,"How this was ever filmed is beyond me. So, dated. And I have now clue what it was about  It's jus bad",1476144000,,101,3.590909090909091
7836275,4,6303018009,"My VCS tape played all the way through with no problems, and the sound was good also.  It arrived by mail, as expected.",1408233600,,119,4.173913043478261
7836276,5,6303018009,"Wonderful!  Exciting! Touching! Funny! Sad! Enjoyable from beginning to end!!!! I loved this movie!!! I have been a fan of Stephanie Z. since her Remington Steele days. It was great to see Stephanie & Peter Scholari together again on TV since Remington Steele days. What a surprise it was to hear them both sing!! What wonderful, & powerful voices they have!! She looks beautiful in this production. Once you watch this movie you will be humming the songs all day long! At this point you can only get the movie in VHS form. Luckily we still had a VCR hanging around the house. I am hoping someday that it will be on dvd. She/both need to do another musical with the talent they have.",1357862400,3,683,4.508064516129032
7836277,3,6303018009,"I saw Newley perform the revival of this show and loved it. So after seeing this filmed version, I sit and wonder for what purpose was it filmed. Was it for one of those theatre night special evening shows Movie theaters offered briefly in the 60's?

The performances seemed rushed and lacking of all comedy timing. Were they late for a bus?  During the song SOMEONE NICE, you can see the sound man and one of the chorus girls hanging out in  the background. The young actresses introducing the episodic segments in LittleChap's life are inexperienced to the camera.  One even moves her eyes back and forth no doubt looking to someone to cue her to begin speaking.

And someone please explain why the clever song TYPESCHE DEUTCHE (a song worthy of Mel Brooks' THE PRODUCERS) was replaced with TYPANEE JAPANEE. And lyrics in MUMBO JUMBO were re-written.

Tanner and Millicent Martin are better than their rushed performances in this version and it makes me yearn to see Newley  and Anna Quayle in it. It truly is a shame Newley gave the role to someone who only gives a cliff notes performance.

It is sort of like seeing a high school or college production of a show you were always curious to see. If you get past the wooden performances, you can imagine or realize why the show was great in its original form.",1353715200,2,1311,4.572649572649572
