Karajan's dominion in Strauss is well known. Being the master of the long line, Metamorphosen was one of his showpieces. Having recorded it in '47, '69 and '82, this is his final reckoning. Karajan knew Strauss and famously received permission to use more than twenty three musicians. Here, he replicates the triumphs of the previous performances. The desolation and longing are aptly captured. When the motiv from the Eroica makes an appearance, one is engulfed by sorrow - and the (wider) barbarism that catalysed the work becomes evident from afar.

I defy you to make a cup of coffee after such an experience.

First class though it be, this performance of Death and Transfiguration lacks the thrust of the famous 1973 version&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Strauss-Four-Last-Songs-Karajan-Berlin-Philharmonic-Orchestra/dp/B000001GQF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Strauss: Four Last Songs / Karajan, Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra</a>. It does make one wonder as to what degree Karajan supplemented his orchestral forces in many of those renowned recordings from the Seventies. The famous grip, however, is firmly in evidence. Not once during the twenty five minutes does Karajan falter. He builds momentum inexorably. There are no premature climaxes. It's full throttle once the true summit is reached. The Berlin Philharmonic is refinement itself.

But wait. It's apotheosis time.

The last two or so minutes of Death and Transfiguration are superimposed with Herbie's face. It appears like a mandylion and progressively fades from view as the music dies away. Karajan was never shy in front of the camera - indeed, he always demanded a lion's share of attention - but this is shamelessly self-indulgent: how will we ever live without him! Given his micro-management of these productions, Herbie himself must have countenanced this atrocity. Among his many retainers and cronies, where was the slave to whisper a Caesar-like admonition into his ear? One can only laugh in response. All flesh is as grass.

All in all, this are fine performances by the leading Strauss conductor of his time - arm yourself with popcorn for the finale!",1315612800,,2270,5.565217391304348
