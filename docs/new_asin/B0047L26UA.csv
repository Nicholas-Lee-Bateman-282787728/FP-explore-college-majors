8418243,4,B0047L26UA,"This DVD set is pretty nice - good items covered and the quality is good. They don't spend a lot of time on each of these subjects, but the footage is really spectacular in spots.",1389657600,,179,4.142857142857143
8418244,2,B0047L26UA,"I bought this because I saw 60-Minutes Sports coverage of Alex Honnold and they talked about the short movie called ""Alone on the Wall.""  This part of the set is very good but is short and doesn't offer much more than the 60 Minutes segment.  The other stories on the CDs aren't good at all.  The characters covered aren't interesting and some are annoying.  I've had it for four months but haven't watched but one disc because it's painful to watch; particularly given what I paid for it.",1364256000,4,489,4.5227272727272725
8418245,5,B0047L26UA,"This is an awesome and in-depth look at the struggles of climbers pushing it to the edge. These DVD's brought me closer to climbing than anything I've ever seen before! Serious... Like Sasha DiGiulian says, ""Everything about climbing is really personal for me."" & that's a way these DVD's make me feel, most of the episodes on this evoke a deeper sense of spirit in me to get out and be in nature, pushing myself. Alex Honnold is unbelievable and my first DVD won't play anymore it's so scratched, I've shown everyone I know, 'Alone on the Wall.'",1350518400,,546,4.581632653061225
8418246,5,B0047L26UA,"In the pantheon of climbing movies, this First Ascent series is Zeus.  It is required viewing for anyone who loves the sport whether, actively or as a spectator.  This series sets the bar for true storytelling, amazing scenes and for capturing the real sport.",1349740800,,259,4.863636363636363
8418247,3,B0047L26UA,This movie is a collection of 30 min videos. Some of them are very interesting and others are not quite what i expected. A few of them have very little climbing in them so if you like your climbing videos with all out climbing all the time this isn't your movie set. The stories are very good though so if you dig a movie with climbing in it then this is a good set to pick up.,1320278400,3,377,3.909090909090909
