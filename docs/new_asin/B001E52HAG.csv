8296355,4,B001E52HAG,"I don't know why Jen's on the cover, she's not in the workout.  PJ O'Clair and Moira workout side by side with the large stability ball using moves that challenged my core stability.  Watch out if you have knee issues.  I enjoyed most of the exercises, though the pike series was tough.  Try a plank position with one hand on the stability ball.  I'd be careful with this one if I had wrist issues.  No circus act moves, really.  I'd combine this workout with another, although I did enjoy the fluidity of this workout.  I gave it four stars b/c although it was thorough, I thought it would be more than it was.",1351296000,,611,4.345132743362832
8296356,5,B001E52HAG,I am a certified STOTT  PILATES instructor and share this workout with both personal clients and classes. People love it! It is helpful to know the basic principles and how to properly flex and extend your spine. I do advanced matwork as well and this is well rounded and challenging when done correctly.,1332028800,2,304,4.735849056603773
8296357,2,B001E52HAG,"As an avid lover of Pilates I was disappointed in the Stability Ball Challenge workout.  I decided to use my Bally Fitness Center membership and get up early for the 5:30 a.m. class, using 2-1/2 pound ankle weights to make the workout more challenging.  Because of that, I won't watch this DVD again.  Waste of money.  Thank you!",1308700800,,329,4.620689655172414
