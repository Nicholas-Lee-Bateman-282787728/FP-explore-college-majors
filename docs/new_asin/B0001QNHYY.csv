no ""tuck your elbow, clear your hips, flatten your plane, etc.""
pretty much ""this is how u grip it, this is how you stand and go""

this is a replacement of my copy that i had bought 20 years ago and got loaned out over the years and disappeared

i carry an 11 handicap and i go back to this basic video whenever i watch too much golf channel

if u plan on playing on the pga and have the time to practice 5 hours a day then this is not sophisticated enough 4 u but if u want to keep your head clear and pretty much grip it and rip it then its definitely worth the $5.

i also have the dvd 2nd version with a similar title and its just not close to being as good

good luck",1350000000,,734,3.8026315789473686
