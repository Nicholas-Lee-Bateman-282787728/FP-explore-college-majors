8071278,3,B000A0GP6S,"This movie offers the first 10 cartoons of Ren and Stimpy, ONLY that. Which is fine, but I would of enjoyed a little more cartoons for my $ so don't be fooled by the imitation season one AND two - which may be true? only if both the seasons were 5 cartoons long.",1152057600,2,262,3.9622641509433962
8071279,2,B000A0GP6S,"I bought this UMD set, after having bought the DVD set for home, what a rip-off!  Amazon should be shamed for decceptive selling practices in saying this is a season 1 & 2, it's missing 22 episodes!  If family guy is sold as a complete 2 season set, and this is advertized as such, it is simply dishonest to sell this set  as the compilation that it is not, FOR SHAME!",1148947200,8,368,4.154929577464789
8071280,3,B000A0GP6S,"I often enjoy classic cartoons for the best of Nickelodeon. Nevertheless, where so many of them have gotten so much respect within the fields of animation, there are just very few that still remain standing. For Ren & Stimpy, they have maintained the ironic cult popular status. However, when the animated series was released on DVD the past year and a half, it has had its share of problems with edited and unedited down controversy. That has been unfortunate for die hard fans. The PSP also has had that popularity status, but for Ren & Stimpy on DVD, that isn't all what it seems.

The Ren & Stimpy Show The First & Second Seasons, volume 1 for the Sony PSP is a collection of ten of the outrageous animated mayhem episodes of the cat & dog duo. The compilation does consist of some great classics like the funny and nerver-splitting Nurse Stimpy, the silly dalmation antics of Fire Dogs, where Ren & Stimpy get positions as assistants to firefighters, and the Ren & Stimpy version of Robin Hood, Robin Hoek. All in all the mastering on this is fairly well, but for people who have bought the three disc DVD version of Ren & Stimpy Seasons 1 & 2, might want to avoid purchasing this for the Sony PSP. Considering so many episodes like Ren's Toothache, the classic Stimpy's Invention and The Royal Canadian Kilted Yaksman weren't even highlighted at all on this collection.

For anybody who loves Ren & Stimpy, and owns a Sony PSP, you might want to pass this collection up, and consider the DVD compilation instead. You arguably would get so much more at a much more reasonable price over that way, rather than this compilation has to be desired. No Happy Happy, Joy Joy!

I want two things or three from my psp and UMD. First how about some respect?

Second how stores actually stocking them besides online. I love Amazon don't get me wrong but sometime there is such thing as instant gratification.

Third how about if we get actually box sets instead of just one season of this: Ren & Stimpy - The First and Second Seasons, Vol 1 (UMD Mini For PSP). There is only ten episodes. Whare are the other 22? HELLO is anyone listening to me?

Finally let's get Grand Theft Audio out already. Can you imagine that some online stores have been accepting preorders since March and it doesn't come out ""November"". I thought July 26th was the release day.

I love my PSP but it's totally under used.",1126656000,,724,4.454545454545454
