8431423,5,B004IZ0LRA,"Originally a radio programme, After Henry was successfully made into a TV situation comedy by UK ITV contractor Thames Television back in 1988. Joan Sanderson and Prunella Scales are hilarious as the mother and daughter in this comedy fit for the whole family.
I remember seeing this on ITV back in 1988 every Monday at 8pm, just after Coronation Street.
It was a very good trip down Memory Lane and I certainly look forward to watching the other series available.
Enjoy.",1340236800,,471,4.827160493827161
