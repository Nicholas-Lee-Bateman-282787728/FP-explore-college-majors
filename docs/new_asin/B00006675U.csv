1711385,5,B00006675U,This movie is absolutely wonderful.  I got it for my husband as a gift because it is one of his favorite movies and with good reason. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies about animals.,1292976000,,205,4.394736842105263
1711386,5,B00006675U,"When grizzly cub Wahb's mother and sister are killed by the Colonel, a local rancher, the Colonel's Cree Indian foreman, Moki, tries to help his ""brother bear"" by taking him far out into the wilderness and away from the humans invading his land. Little Wahb still struggles, of course, growing up without his family; no one to teach him how to survive, hibernate, or anything else. He manages, however, and grows into a true king of grizzlies. That makes no difference to the Colonel though, when Wahb returns years later to unintentionally wreak havoc and frighten his men and animals. Wahb's only chance at survival again lies in the decisions made by Moki in his struggle to balance emotions and responsibilities to his heritage and to his career.

In the tradition of Disney True-Life Adventures and animal stories, 1970's ""King of the Grizzlies"" is a true Disney treasure featuring legendary Disney animal-film narrator Winston Hibler (for the other Disney animal-film narration legend, Rex Allen, try ""Charlie the Lonesome Cougar""). If you grew up with these sorts of films, either in theaters or on the Disney Channel or Disney anthology series, you already know what a wholesome and relaxing delight they are, great for the whole family to watch together and full of fun, humor, education, and the majestic beauty of nature. ""King of the Grizzlies"" fits right in with the other Disney animal classics with its story of life as a grizzly and the good and bad that can come from man's interaction with the animal kingdom.

Warning: King of the Grizzlies does depict animal death by shooting. Early on, the Colonel shoots at Wahb and his family from a distance, leaving him alone in the world, as I mentioned, and in the middle of the story, three wolves are shot and killed off camera (I did take issue with Moki's complete lack of feeling when killing wolves, my own favorite animal, in contrast to his stress over the killing of bears; then again, his kinship with bears is nicely explained through a Cree creation myth). I mention this because I know personally some folks who just can't watch anything involving animals being hurt/killed, though keep in mind that there is no gore and it is all to reflect the realism of ranching life of the time and necessary to the story too. ""King of Grizzlies"" is still a wonderful, beautiful film about the man vs. animal territory struggle and learning to live together with mutual respect.

Though I still recommend it, the DVD from Disney is, unfortunately, totally bare bones. It has a fullscreen presentation, but I do not know for sure what the proper aspect ratio is, and some Disney films are correctly presented in fullscreen. There IS a bonus to be had if you buy this DVD from the right source while Disney's ""Earth"" is still in theaters. Currently, some retailers carrying ""King of the Grizzlies"" offer it with a special sticker on the cover that holds a code for free movie cash (up to 8 dollars for use on a child's ticket; some more expensive Disney DVDs hold the up-to-12 dollars adult ticket movie cash code). However, if I was buying this with the movie cash in mind, I'd buy it in person to make sure the sticker was there. It all depends on where you get it, but this offer won't be good for much longer anyway. I recommend picking up ""King of the Grizzlies"" on its own merits, because it's just a great film.",1240876800,2,3378,4.722033898305085
1711387,3,B00006675U,"But it did not keep the kids entertained as much as I thought it would. I had them from 4-8 years old, and not one was totally enthralled with it. It was just OK, the best thing about it was that it is actually a G rated one, they are getting hard to find!",1230595200,,256,3.759259259259259
1711388,3,B00006675U,"Taking place at the tail end of the Old West era, King of the Grizzlies documents the story of Moh-Sum-See Wahb, a grizzly bear with an odd track-mark. He lives an idyllic life with his mother and his twin sister. He hunts, plays, meets a marmot and a badger, and even does some snow sledding on a vessel made of bark. As the events unfold, a narrator (Winston Hibler) tells us what we're seeing and what Wahb is presumably thinking and feeling. Eventually man comes into the picture, bringing with him a whole lot of trouble. The movie is slowly-paced and might bore the tykes, but the scenery and wildlife is breathtaking. Based upon The Biography of a Grizzly by Ernest Thompson Seton.

1711389,5,B00006675U,"""The King of the Grizzlies"" combines a wonderful animal tale with spectacular outdoor scenery to make for a wonderful movie that will be enjoyed by the entire family.  In this movie, viewers learn a lot about bears live in the wilderness and the role of man vs. animal in the untamed West of 1899.  Viewers also learn a little about Native Americans and their culture, especially their bond with nature and wildlife, as seen through the devotion of Moki (the Indian boy who helps the Colonel with his catttle drive) and Wahb (the bear who is the main star of the movie).  Animals and outdoor scenery dominate much of this film.  Constantly changing events in Wahb's life and travels hold the viewer's attention, along with the beautiful forested mountains and rushing blue waters.  A great film for the entire family.  Fast paced, lots of natural action and drama.  A must see.

1711403,5,B00006675U,"When I was in the EAD-USAF and stationed in Idaho in TAC/USAF at Mt. Home AFB, reports of Grizzly Bear sightings and attacks were well known.
As a boy, I grew up with Disney movies and the outdoors in the Boy Scouts of America.  As a family movie in the Disney tradition, all of those memories were revitalized.  Winston Hibler was a narrator of several Disney Nature movies and TV programs.  The central feature of this DVD movie is the Bear Moh-Sum-See-Wahb as the star actor growing up from a cub to a full grown bear and the countryside.  The scenery is magnificent.  It includes Mokie (John Yesno) a young Cree Indian who grows up not only to know the lore of his own native American people, but also to be a foreman for the Colonel on his cattle ranch.  There is a mystical relationship between Moki and Wahb.  The Bear returns and Moki has to defend the cattle ranch from grizzly havoc.  Today's environmentalist would enjoy this Disney movie in which man and bear learn to co-exist in nature.  This movie is based on a story circa 1899 that has all the features and content of a book authored by Ernest Thompson Seton.  It is superb.  Overall this is five-star entertainment for family viewing with several good lessons to be learned.",1468368000,,1242,4.54954954954955

1711412,4,B00006675U,"This is a wildlife nature movie with a narration throughout.  It can also double as a travelogue considering some of the incredible scenery.  There are actors involved but very little dialog and absolutely no character development.  They could have just as easily used sock puppets and achieved the same results.  The star of this film was the grizzly bear Wahb.  The story follows his life through many years, marked each step of the way by how much he weighed at any given time.  His mother and twin sister are gunned down early in the film, by the faux villain of the piece (Chris Wiggins as the Colonel).  Wahb is saved by falling into a river.  He returns to the area eons later to exact his revenge when fate conspires to put Wahb, the killer Colonel, and Moki (John Yesno) together for a final showdown.  In between there is a lot of frolicking, critter confrontations, fishing, grizzly romance, territorially fights, a stampede, and an entertaining interlude with Shorty (Hugh Webster), the shiftless ranch hand, who knows how to play dead so expertly that Wahb tries to bury him.",1436745600,2,1088,4.775401069518717

1711422,5,B00006675U,"I first saw this film in the theater with my parents in the early '70's.  It is a Disney adaptation of Ernest Thompson Seton's ""Biography of a Grizzly.""  ""King of the Grizzlies"" is Disney fare, which means that it is definitely family-friendly AND possessed of excellent photography and cinematography.

The story itself loosely follows the plot of the original story but does not distort it.  The original ""Meteetsee Wahb"" was an 1100-pound cattle killer that was not nearly as cuddly as this bear is, but the cinematic Wahb is very handsome, well-trained, and does evoke a certain sympathy for the species.  Most Disney films featuring live-action animal performers were designed to evoke viewers' support for animals, and this one is no exception.  To its credit, the film also does not represent an attempt to malign the reputation of early Western hunters or ranchers.

Great family fare to watch with your kids on a weeknight or a weekend afternoon.",1373846400,4,955,5.006329113924051
