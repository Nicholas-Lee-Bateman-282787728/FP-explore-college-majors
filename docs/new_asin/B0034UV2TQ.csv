8388542,5,B0034UV2TQ,Beautifully done. Excellent demos and inspirational. Highly recommend.,1411084800,,70,7.875
8388543,5,B0034UV2TQ,"Many of us have taken at least one of Alvaro's workshop, but each time he demonstrates, his discipline of color and light is a new eye-opening experience. This collection is invaluable for student and follower of Castagnet's beautiful brushstroke style and powerful use of pigment and water...a method you must master to paint anywhere near this man's style.

This is a must see for any serious watercolorist.",1398211200,2,409,5.104477611940299
8388544,4,B0034UV2TQ,I knew going into it that this DVD was not as instructional as other one's I have purchased from other watercolor artists. But for the price it was worth seeing his painting process. It was also very valuable to see how he is not always looking at the most picturesque scene and has the eye and experience to make it look more attractive.,1383004800,,338,4.380952380952381
8388545,5,B0034UV2TQ,What can I say? I'm a fan-boy of this guy's work! I've seen his videos 10+ times. What I did was screen capture the video creating process shots that I've saved onto a Pages document and simply practice his techniques step-by-step. The videos are great because Alvaro always tells you the colors he uses.,1371168000,2,304,4.648148148148148
8388546,5,B0034UV2TQ,Just goes to show you how a little tripod and an interesting tin palette and a great companion of an artist can send you to the moon. I was so encouraged by his direct manner.,1356480000,,175,4.0285714285714285
8388547,3,B0034UV2TQ,I really wanted a teaching video and this is what I expected. It is a very good video to illustrate how the artist paints. I enjoyed seeing his technique and the beautiful paintings he was able to produce on the video.,1314662400,2,218,4.341463414634147
