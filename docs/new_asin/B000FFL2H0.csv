2562851,2,B000FFL2H0,"I have to start by saying that the scenery was very pretty in some parts of the movie.  However I bought this movie for my eight yr old daughter, and the actors had such an accent that even I couldn't understand what they were saying.  The ""actors"" were very poor on acting.  Sadness and Joy were only shown through a facial expression.  Peter was a grumpy brat who threatened to slap a baby goat. My main complaint though is just the lack of decent acting on the part of the characters.  Nobody was very convincing.  I would not recomend wasting your money on this feable attempt of a movie",1180915200,5,591,4.376146788990826
2562852,5,B000FFL2H0,"The little girl who plays Heidi is very charming. The scenery and homes are beautiful. I have seen five versions of ""Heidi"" and liked them all. Each is different enough to be interesting. Heidi is very thoughtful of others. Pleasant and relaxing, moves along steadily.

A little girl goes to live with her grandfather high in the Alpine mountains of Switzerland. She makes friends with a boy who herds the goats. She has adventures as a friend to a girl in wheel-chair of a wealthy family, who has an unkind governess.",1170720000,3,518,4.6923076923076925
2562853,5,B000FFL2H0,"I was always a fan of the Shirley Temple version of Heidi because it was sentimental and it touched my heart-strings!  I enjoyed this version so much because of the photography, the actors, and as an adult now I felt the story touched broadly on ""life"" themes of hurt, forgiveness, love and joy of simple living and of life in general....not to mention the happy ending which I'm always a sucker for.  Thorougly enjoyable and one I know I'll watch and share over and over again.",1163030400,27,478,4.546511627906977
2562854,5,B000FFL2H0,"Overall this is our favorite version of Heidi in film. We highly recommend it! Our family watched this movie anticipating the same cutesy antics and departures from the novel as before but were surprised to find this one quite close to the book. It is a bit more somber than the book in my view but this adds a real 19th century feel anyway.  Emma Bolger plays Heidi with enough childlike charm, she's not always perfect but her shining eyes and sweet grin helpd me forgive a few tiny flaws in her acting. Max Von Sydow plays Grandfather immaculately with the right amount of grumpiness and compassion.  The best performance I think is Del Synott as Sebastian the butler! The only thing I wish the director would have done differently is to spend more time on Heidi's enjoyment in the pastures as is done in the beginning of the book.  I would have been delighted to see more expansive views of the Swiss alps also, some of the cinematography is shot closer in with cozier views. I recommend watching this movie then going back to the read the book once again if it has been awhile.  It is a truly heartwarming parable.",1162080000,21,1119,4.524752475247524
2562855,5,B000FFL2H0,I loved this version of Johanna Spyri's classic novel.  Emma Bolger is so cute and sweet and just how I had always pictured Heidi.  This story follows the book better than any I have ever seen.  Sometimes it is quite sad - we cried during some scenes.  But Max Von Sydow and Emma Bolger show the wonderful relationship between Grandparent and Grandchild. The acting and directing are Superb!  I rarely give 5 stars but I certainly will this time.,1161648000,36,446,4.594936708860759
2562856,5,B000FFL2H0,"The story in this movie is faithful to the book in almost all respects.  More important, the movie is faithful to the spirit of the book.  The characters are appealing, and Max von Sydow manages to play the grandfather's gruff moments without alienating the audience.  Also, the screenwriter obviously learned a thing or two from the previous movie versions and incorporated some of the effective touches from those movies.

The Shirley Temple version is very good at the beginning, then the screenwriter throws the book away, and the chase scenes and the cloak-and-dagger intrigue are not only ineffective but embarrassing.

The 1952 version shortens the story but adds a nice touch of having her Aunt lie to Heidi about being able to return to the mountains.

The 1968 version almost throws the book away and the child is too old for the role, but the scenery and the music are very good.

The 1993 version reproduces most of the story of the book but throws the book away at the end.  Also, the characters are totally different, even antithetical, to what they are in the book.  I tried watching it a second time just to be sure and I couldn't make it through the movie.

So, this is THE version of the book.

The minor departures are the grandfather's angry reaction when Heidi returns.  (Fortunately, this is only momentary.)  And the walking.  The movie has Clara take her first steps as a result of a situation of danger.  Thereafter, however, they do put in the patient physical therapy which the grandfather practices to enable Clara to walk by the end of the summer.

A nice touch is the addition of the doctor's role in Dorfli.  None of the other movie versions saw fit to put it in.  This movie not only puts it in but shows why it is important.  The child who plays Heidi is appealing and close enough in age.",1157673600,124,1822,4.60248447204969
2562857,3,B000FFL2H0,"Beloved tale of the little girl Heidi has been often filmed in the past, and probably the most popular one would be the 1937 `Heidi' film starring lovely Shirley Temple. Now another feature film comes from England, starring Emma Bolger (one of the cute sisters in `In America') as the Swiss girl.

I don't think this famous story needs introduction, but I may be wrong. Just in case you forget it, it is about an orphaned little girl Heidi (Emma Bolger). Heidi is sent to her grandfather `Uncle Alp' (Max von Sydow) who is living like a hermit up in the Alps with two goats. Her grandfather, whose dark past is vaguely suggested, is at first unwilling to welcome her, but no one can resist the charms of her outgoing personality.

The key characters are all there. You will meet Heidi's friend Peter and his blind grandmother, too. And you also remember the inimitable Rottenmeier (played by Geraldine Chaplin) and Clara (Jessica Claridge) and her wheelchair. Diana Rigg also appears as Clara's kind grandmamma. The cast is impressive, to be sure.

So we got what we want. We got the right cast (though you may not like the various accents from the cast), and a very good story from Johanna Spyri (as you know it). And fortunately they didn't change it very much. Plus the film is shot in beautiful countryside of Slovenia (on location) and West Wales (on soundstage). But to me, the entire film is slightly disappointing, lacking the weight or impact that the story as I remember it had given to me long time ago.

Perhaps that is because the film's script follows the original story too fast, omitting the quiet moments that should have made the characters more round. Clara's character and her friendship with Heidi, one of the most touching part of the story, are often overshadowed by awkwardly presented episodes (about the smuggled kittens that annoy poor Rottenmeier) that try to be funny. In fact, for all the film's decent production designs, `Heidi' sometimes looks as if made for TV (which it is not) because of its hurried and episodic storytelling.

Or perhaps the film touches the subject of children's growing-up and education for them too cursorily. Rottenmeier of this film sometimes looks like a theatrical villain (or villainess) from fairy tale, like a witch to be punished, and consequently the film seems to have failed to make a point about one of the most important themes of the original. Of course you don't have to preach - and thank God, `Heidi' is far from preachy, I can assure you - but it is also certain that while director Paul Marcus reminds us of Heidi's illiteracy more than once, the film itself curiously seems unaware of the importance of that.

Or perhaps ... well, let's stop now. The fact is, if her accent is not the most convincing, Emma Bolger still gives a very spirited performance as Heidi, which is pure delight to see. Thanks to her adorable Heidi and the good supports, `Heidi' is a decent (if flawed) family film.",1155859200,9,2967,4.729206963249516
2562858,3,B000FFL2H0,"First, the director obviously likes close-up shots very much. You'll face full-screen faces and faces every minute. Some may love them, but I.

Second, the story covers several episodes and dialogues in the original novel, and stuffed them into 100 minutes film. Result, it's lacking rhyme or reason a little bit.

How Heidi delighted people ? How she opened up her grandpa ?

How mountain air worked Clara's body ?

Unfortunately, in this film, explanation of these main themes of this lovable classic work are almost omitted. So if you haven't read the novel, you may be puzzled by the story (On the other hand, some poor arrangement are added - Granpa's attitude when Heidi came back from Frankfurt, for instance.)

Of course a movie can be different from its original story.

But this movie isn't one in which they attempt to create new 'another Heidi', or I can't say they make the best of the original material. Which I feel sorry for very much.

However, some actor(esse)s are nice (I like the hand-organ player boy.)

19th century settings are happy to watch, and the mountain sceneries also fascinating (the end title tells it was filmed in Slovenia and Wales.)",1155513600,4,1170,4.815
2562859,4,B000FFL2H0,"Once we convinced Gramma that Shirley Temple wasn't the only one who could play Heidi, we all enjoyed this movie immensely. It completely captivated my 7.5y.o. niece, for whom this wad her first introduction to the story. (She didn't even care that the actor playing Peter couldn't really act and that the actress playing Clara was only so-so; the other actors more than made up for their deficiencies with their acting.) It was a wonderful way to introduce her to this classic story!",1472947200,2,484,4.843373493975903
2562860,5,B000FFL2H0,"This version of Heidi is visual eye candy.  Max Von Sydow plays his character gracefully and with boldness.  Emma Bolton is adorable.

2562893,3,B000FFL2H0,"Having seen several film versions of ""Heidi"", this one does seem to follow the story line of the children's novel written by Swiss author, Johanna Spyri, better than many of the others. However, being of Swiss descent and having visited Switzerland many times, the lack of authenticity really ruined it for me. The scenery, architecture, clothing and other details looked ""off"" to me from the start, and you'd think the actors could at least have had German, not English, accents.  Additionally, there is a scene where some village girls in traditional costume, carrying a Maypole of sorts, greet Heidi and her grandfather...both the costumes and the Maypole tradition are definitely not Swiss. The two goats' names, Schwnli (Little Swan) and Brli (Little Bear), which are not difficult names to pronounce and are part of the English translations of the book, were substituted with two goofy ""Americanized"" names, Dusty and Daisy. After all, this IS a story set in Switzerland and Germany, and deserves to be portrayed accurately. As the movie progressed, it felt more and more like I was watching the film version of a Charles Dickens novel, not one by Johanna Spyri. Of course, when the film got to the credits, all was revealed: it was produced in the UK, and filmed in Wales and Slovenia. Really? The film story line was on the right track...but it's too bad it didn't go a step further and get the details right.",1400112000,9,1417,4.8796680497925315

But watching it as a family was a nice change from watching the kids shows we normally see.",1371686400,,322,4.262295081967213
2562907,1,B000FFL2H0,"I didn't think that anyone could take the story of Heidi and make it not really suitable for small children but they did. This movie is just mean spirited most of the time.  Geraldine Chaplin looks and acts like she just stepped out of a horror movie.  Are both the father and the grandmother so dense that they can't see how horrible she is. So, the father goes off for months at a time and leaves his daughter with this creature. Doesn't make any sense. It's been 60 years since I read the book but I don't remember it being like this movie.  I much prefer the Maximillian Schell/Jean Simmons version.  I could look at that one over and over and actually I have seen it many times.  I'm sure I'll never look at this one again.  The child playing Heidi is too big for the role but she is absolutely precious. Another question is why did they never do anything to make her hair look any better. It always looks greasy and in disarray.  Also, the girl playing Clara already has a bosom and is obviously too old and too big for the role. But, she is charming and one of the few nice characters in the movie. I think they made the Grandfather much too mean. No man with any redeeming features at all would shut his grandchild out of his house when she returns. They just took meanness and gruffness too far. Sebastian, bless his heart, is one of the few nice people she finds in Frankfurt. Why is the maid played so mean. This is, after all, a children's story.  Why are so many of these people so mean and scarey. Even Peter turns mean near the end. What the heck is going on in a film about Heidi when Peter turns mean. I guess they had to set up Clara's walking somehow but they didn't have to do this. So, if you are thinking of ordering this movie for your child, don't do it. I'm 76 years old and I was disturbed by it.  Get the Maximillian Schell/Jean Simmons version. It's an absolute delight from start to finish. I really didn't like this version of the story at all.",1369872000,4,1974,4.25668449197861

2562916,3,B000FFL2H0,"I, too, was disappointed that they took those wonderful lessons about God (that were so important in the book) out of the movie.  :(  Those lessons were what made the book so good.  In the book, Heidi taught others with her innocent youth and trust in God, through lessons learned and the insightful wisdom of Clara's Grandmother.  Then, she passes those lessons on to her Grandfather, which allow him to move on with his life and reenter the town of Dorfli.  All of these details are SO important to the book.  It is sad that they have been removed from this movie.  I will have to watch some other Heidi DVD's to see if any of the others retain that message.

On the plus side, some of the scenery was nice.  It is a good safe family movie, but NOT the same, or as good as the book.",1304553600,8,784,4.243243243243243
2562917,3,B000FFL2H0,"The only reason I give this review 3 stars is because it's a decent, conservative, family film about love and nature.  The moral of the story, though, as we (my children and I) learned from the book - which we read before watching the movie - is that God answers prayer and forgives us no matter what.  This basic foundation of the story that was so carefully included by the original author was completely ignored in this movie.  I am so disappointed.  I read the reviews before buying to make sure not to buy a ""cinderallafied"" version, and this accomplished that objective, but it's such a shame that they took God out of the story.",1303430400,27,635,4.495652173913044
2562918,4,B000FFL2H0,"This movie is fine until it skips through part of ""Sunday Bells"" and then it jumps right to Heidi recving the letter from Clara. The reason I say it was only ""fine"" is it messes up on other details as well. I liked being able to share Chistmas with Heidi and Grandfather.",1299369600,2,271,4.230769230769231
2562919,1,B000FFL2H0,"I received a cartoon version instead of the one that I ordered.  I have ordered a lot of things through amazon and this is the first time this has ever happened.

2562920,3,B000FFL2H0,"I purchased this version hoping it would be the best version to date of Johanna Spyri's delightful and thought provoking book.  It is not !  The dialog and feel of the film are rather modern and compromise the efforts of the actors/actresses.

The grandmother, played by Diana Rigg is excellent.  Fraulein Rottenmeier, played by Geraldine Chaplin (whom I like otherwise), is overplayed and positively villainous.  Clara's father is excellent and so is the Doctor.  Clara was quite good, convincing and definitely in character.

The goatherd, besides being given ridiculous lines, is a poor actor. Aunt Dete was sulky and peevish, instead of self-centered and nasty. Unfortunately, Emma Bolger as Heidi disappoints.  She is not well developed as a young actress.  She does not convince one that she is young, innocent, and charming.  Simply, she does not bring Heidi to life.  It would help if her dialog were more convincing as well. Grandfather was bland, or shallow, one of the two.  He was ok, or a little better than ok, that's all.  His lack of dialog was not the reason for this.  For proof, see the Grandfather in the Shirley Temple version.  He says volumes, yet rarely opens his mouth.

Too much drama, not enough innocence and joie de vivre, and a soundtrack that is overdone (perhaps thinking of CD sales ?).",1273622400,7,1319,4.900452488687783
2562921,4,B000FFL2H0,"My 8-year-old daughter and I just finished reading Heidi, and I wanted to find a movie version that stayed close to the original story. As many of the reviewers point out, this one is very faithful to the book, following it as closely as you can probably expect from a movie. The characters are also well cast; they are exactly as you would expect them to be - except, unfortunately, for the title character. Heidi is supposed to be spunky, lively, and charming, melting the hearts of everyone around her with her contagious joie-de-vivre. This Heidi (Emma Bolger) is quiet, pale, and serious throughout the movie. This may be appropriate for her demeanor in Frankfurt, but certainly not when she's roaming her beloved Alps. Other reviewers seem to think that Emma Bolger did a fine job as Heidi, so maybe it's just me. But I found that it detracted from an otherwise fine rendition of this classic story.",1262563200,3,905,4.734177215189874
2562922,5,B000FFL2H0,I got it for my wife for Christmas. She fell in love with the movie and has already watched it several times. It went directly into her stack of favorites.,1261785600,,155,4.2
2562923,2,B000FFL2H0,"Yes, the scenery was wonderful, and Max was a good choice for the role of Alm Uncle, even though they change his name to Uncle Alp.  But where do the filmakers get license to change the story so?  What kind of arrogance might have led them to think that they could improve on the book?  How do these changes help anything?  Obviously I feel that they don't, and that they should have stuck to the book more closely.  Then there are the accents, which are hard to believe in Switzerland.  And the grandfather telling her to 'get out!' - yea right.  Even the goats got their names changed.  Finally, Heidi doesn't look anything like the Heidi described in the book.  So, here it is : if you want a good story with a cute little girl in the mountains, it's worth your 100 minutes.  But if you're looking for Johanna Spyri's excellent book to come alive, you might be disappointed in the end.",1254528000,8,888,4.392638036809816
2562924,5,B000FFL2H0,"My students spent several weeks reading Heidi.  We were thrilled to watch this DVD as our concluding activity.  Now there are some differences -- the goats have different names, and the end comes about differently than in the book, but it is much closer than other versions.  After reading the book, we enjoyed making a compare and contrast chart between the book and the movie.

This is a great movie.  Enjoy!",1245110400,2,410,4.71830985915493
2562925,5,B000FFL2H0,"This DVD was very satisfying. It was lovely to see Heidi on some mountains, unlike in the Shirley Temple version. Emma Bolger did a great job as Heidi. The film largely left out the harshness towards illiterate Peter that was in the book and highlighted the misery for the Grandfather of being a social outcast. Geraldine Chaplin was a Frau Rottenmeier that you could care about rather than just laugh at. I would say that this DVD is actually an improvement on the original book. However the wildflowers that garlanded the little Golden Book will always remain in my mind as well as Heidi saying, ""Grandfather I am home and will never leave again."" Heidi is one of several books in which an innocent child brings hope to a dried up old adult. Others include Pollyanna, The Secret Garden and Little Lord Fauntleroy (which is worth re-reading).",1229040000,3,843,4.741496598639456

2562928,5,B000FFL2H0,"There are many reviews on this item already.  I want to give a specific reason to add mine:  Geraldine Chaplin's portrayal of Frulein Rottenmeier.
At last we have a Rottenmeier who is not ""evil"" but rather one who is unable to show love.
A wonderful moment in the film comes when Diana Rigg's Grandmamma asks her why everyone else sees the good in Heidi but Rottenmeier can not.  A less skillful director (and script) would have taken this opportunity to give Rottenmeier a ""reason"" and a response.
The director simply lingers a moment on Geraldine Chaplin's face and without any words spoken we the audience can see that the flaw is in her character and for a moment we can even show a bit of sympathy for her.

An excellent addition to the film canon of Spyri's classic.",1197244800,3,772,4.572463768115942
