8072608,5,B000A2SYJW,"Like many of her movies, this is a great performance by Gong Li.  She is trying to protect her disabled son and does a marvelous job playing an impassioned mother trying to do the right thing for her son and protect him. This is definitely a must recommend, particularly for Gong Li fans.",1505260800,,288,4.433962264150943
8072609,4,B000A2SYJW,"Breaking the Silence is bittersweet, gray, and heartbreaking. I realize that those words could be used to describe a lot of the Chinese cinema I've seen, but I'm a sucker for such fare. It's a stark portrayal of a woman struggling to make it through life with few options and a deaf son. Purposefully lacking in scenes of bright color or glorious sunshine, Breaking the Silence chooses instead to take us down the back alleys and alongside the mass of humanity in urban China, and director Sun Zhou does a great job of involving the viewer in the story.

Gong Li is again up to the task of bringing average people to life, providing a sense of resilience and determination in her character Sun Liying. She is truly one of the greatest actresses working in cinema, on par with Streep and Winslet, just to name a few. With nuance and an expressive face, she takes what might be a maudlin tale of struggle and hardship and makes it genuine and honest. While not a tear jerker, it is still an emotional movie and one that give the viewer perspective on their own life and struggles. Shi Jing-ming portrays the gentle and compassionate teacher who provides the shoulder of support when Sun needs it most and Gao Xin does a good job as the young boy who is trying to fit in and unable to understand the cruelties of the world.

Breaking the Silence is a lovely afternoon movie to be savored and enjoyed. As a teacher of young children with special needs, I took additional comfort seeing such a story brought to the screen with grace and integrity. Well worth watching. 4.5 stars",1447545600,,1573,4.554770318021202
8072610,3,B000A2SYJW,"The video quality isn't the best, and it's apparently an older work. Still, Gong Li is in it; so, it's worth the investment.",1417132800,,124,4.434782608695652
8072611,4,B000A2SYJW,"Even though the Chinese don't like her, Gong Li's excellent film career speaks for itself.  If you don't know her work, start with Red Sorghum in 1987, Ju Dou, Raise the Red Lantern, Eros, and Michael Mann's Miami Vice in 2006, among others.  Gong Li attacks roles with total commitment and Breaking the Silence is no exception.  She is the real deal.",1364860800,,351,4.629032258064516
8072612,4,B000A2SYJW,"About a single mothers struggles to see her deaf son treated as normal.  Better: to see him not subjected to discrimination on the basis of disability.

Has a clear political message against discrimination, much of which is based upon ignorance and misunderstanding, but no less damaging to its target.

As one who prefers Li Gong in non-glamorous roles (she isn't actually as glamorous or ""gorgeous"" to begin with, despite what many are taught to believe), such as ""The Story of Qui Ju,"" and the excellent ""To Live,"" I preferred this to such as ""Raise the Red Lantern,"" which despite the plaudits strikes me as remote, even cold.  This, by contrast, is surprisingly warm.

Recommended.",1293926400,,686,4.982456140350878
8072613,3,B000A2SYJW,"Except for the opportunity to watch the great Gong Li endure the most difficult travails, this film has little to offer beyond it's good intentions.

The story's premise dramatizes a problem found in many societies -- the denial of parents' of the deafness of their deaf or nearly-deaf children -- and their persistence in having them try to live like hearing people.

However, this film doesn't offer much insight into the deaf world. And this mother's struggles aren't too different from poor, single women with normal children. Many scenes wound up being a touch too familiar.

I didn't find the first 2/3s of the film involving, sad to say. The dramatic flow didn't kick into gear for me until the latter part of the film. And that was done by making things too dramatic.

The movie was filmed to present a dark, hopeless mood -- often at night or in dimly lit rooms -- but I suspect some of the too dark scenes may be due to the transfer to DVD -- but I can't be sure.

However, Gong Li can hold any story together. Even those, like this film, that try in vain to make her seem less glamorous than nature made her. She is very proud of her performance in this film -- and she deserves to be. But she's had better roles.",1262304000,,1224,4.4222222222222225
8072614,4,B000A2SYJW,"""Breaking The Silence"" is one of Gong Li's finest works. Li plays the Mother of a hearing-impaired son who wants very much to be ""normal"" and to go to ""normal"" school with other children in his community. Li tries, only in vain, to have her son accepted in the ""normal"" school through recitations with the school Principal, but her son is not accepted. To add to Li's struggles, her son's Father is an unresponsible parent who does very little to help Li as she struggles to make a living and care for a son who has a disability. This film is set in modern-day China and will appeal to anyone who loves Asian cinema and has struggles. Li's coping mechanisms are simply superb.",1197331200,4,676,4.504065040650406
8072615,4,B000A2SYJW,Directed by Zhou Sun. Gong Li with less makeup than usual plays a mother enduring hardship for her son. This is a good Mandarin modern drama.,1152748800,2,141,4.461538461538462
