3882196,4,B0029XFQF0,"I started this series a couple years ago and i was very happy to own it all.  I am sad that they only made two seasons as it has great potential for more.  The writers ability to have stand alone episodes as well as a story line that covers several episodes is great.  well worth watching and owning, i know i will be watching it again soon.
Think firefly meets apocalypse now.  no space ship but a torpedo boat, no Fed but Crime syndicates.",1282608000,,441,4.214285714285714

3882200,5,B0029XFQF0,"This is a great anime for adults and I mean that not because of nudity but because of blood and gore and Mature themes.

Some people are going to say it's a rip off of cowboy bebop because they are bounty hunters but I personally think its better. It has a more character driven story and has an actual plot as opposed to just random bounties like the aforementioned. But that brings me to the only thing I don't like about this anime. Every episode is like a 2 or three part-er with a crazy 5 part conclusion.

Pick this up though if you're interested in complex plot that deals with the criminal underworld. They deal with Russian deserters the Chinese triad a Nazi cult and even a little bit of Yakuza at the end (which is my personal favorite).

ABOUT THE ACTUAL PRODUCT!!!

This is a great box set if you're looking to own both seasons. It comes with 8 discs in thin plastic cases 2 discs to a case in a cardboard sleeve. 2 discs are purely extra features witch I think is a great addition. I think they just put the two separate box set discs into one set and then repackaged it though...",1269475200,7,1094,4.270531400966184
3882201,5,B0029XFQF0,I picked the first one from Netflix because it sounded like more adult anime than the usual stuff. I was right Kiddies don't want to be watching this one. It's not sex - it's the violence. So we got tired of waiting for the mail and ordered the set. It's worth it.,1264809600,,264,4.096153846153846
3882202,5,B0029XFQF0,"Although it lacks the nuance and subtlety of Cowboy Bebop, Black Lagoon more
than makes up for that with fast moving stories and almost non-stop action and
mayhem.  Black Lagoon has all the elements that made Bebop so good but it is
darker in vision and definitely way more violent.  The music is well done, it's not
Yoko Kanno, but interesting enough for me to order the soundtrack, which is
available off Amazon for less than half the price here.*  The packaging is weak.
Comes in a flimsy thin box.  Using two discs for the bonus material is a waste
as neither is ""loaded"" with features.  Lastly, there is humor and light moments
in this series to keep it balanced like Bebop and all the characters are interesting.
The Taiwan assassin ""Chinglish"" was a favorite and Sister Etta with her Rip Off
Church is an original twist.  Nuns with guns. Revy is basically Faye from Bebop
on steriods but more in attitude and bloodlust than appearance.  Animation of
characters and city is great.  Background country scenes looks as may have been
farmed out to lesser studio.  All around this series is a good buy and I am hoping
for more.  *(buyer beware, my order took 3 weeks to arrive).",1259625600,39,1180,4.6028708133971294
3882203,5,B0029XFQF0,"------BLU-RAY REVIEW------

Since amazon will NOT allow me rate the BLU-RAY edition I'll have to put the FINAL review on it here. I will leave the original rant at the bottom to let all know why I did write it in the first place. Poor description of the product on this website continues.

I had to go deep into forums across the interlubes to get a solid conformation on the Blu-Ray release. To find that indeed: funi DID keep the GENEON DTS!! in the Blu-ray discs!!!! CELEBRATION & HUZZAH!!!! And again; I listen to the opening of the show on my PS3 while I write! *ahem*

GET THIS ON BLU NOW!!!!! You will NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!! Not only was this a magnificent series, it got the loving touch of a DUB unmatched by dozens of other weak sauce shows that surrounded it all during the fall of Anime in 2006 and say farewell to the final great show seen here in America. This may well be the ONLY funi release to use the amazing DTS sound format too~

....following now will be the original review.. I suggest you all ignore it. It's just for posterity only.

-In stereo only?! I purchased the first season a while back when Geneon still sold their products in America and the first run had DTS surround for the English track! Funimation then repackage this and removes that?!
-One star for this abortion of such a great show, you will never know how truly awesome this show is if all you do is watch this version.
-[2012] EDIT
If you love Sound - buckle down and buy the Original GENEON compiled release. Looking just at hard info. DTS pumps out a throaty 1.5 MEGA-Bits per Second, while the usual stereo limps out a 192 kilo-Bits per second~  Listening too it now as I type! For all those crying over my star. Anime was at its heights during 2005~2007 before it all popped like the Japanese economy before. Shows like Cowboy Bebop got a second edition with 5.1 dolby for its original english run success, good enough for some Double Dipping! I was thrilled to see T.V. Anime getting SURROUND SOUND! This meant it was was maturing in America... it was sadly but a pipe dream.
-funimation got the second season, but GENEON had already made the audio and all the rest of the Heavy lifting with funimation just releasing it untouched (til afterward).
-It's difficult to know if funimation even decided to release theirs in 5.1 dolby. No help here in Amazon at all. So I went to the funimation website. Information should be FREELY available there right?... NOPE. So I went deeper into the site and found out that it shuffles me over to the website rightstuf ~~~~ Where the description is equal to Amazon. Do I need to go throughout the interlube to find a more Detailed breakdown of any item I want to purchase? A call to rightstuf might get me a read on the back of the package, but as a customer this is disgraceful!",1256601600,,2816,4.468871595330739
3882204,4,B0029XFQF0,"For many fans of the franchise, it is incredible news that Funimation has decided to assemble the full previously Geneon-exclusive property and release it as a complete series box set.

Black Lagoon is one of those rare anime titles that manage to combine a near endless succession of violence and gunplay with a gritty back-story that provides far more than just a catalyst to advance the action-sequences along. Thanks to collaboration between Geneon Entertainment and Funimation, the Black Lagoon series is one of several titles in which while Geneon retains the license, Funimation holds the rights to the manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution in North America.

In terms of the Black Lagoon mythos, The Complete Box Set represents the full two-season run of the anime, which was itself based on a manga written and illustrated by Rei Hiroe.

Released across eight discs (thin packs) and packaged within a cardboard outer slipcase, The Complete Box Set consists of episodes 1-24.  Bonus discs are loaded with a host of interesting material including the show's Promo Video, ""Red Faction"" music video (performed by MELL), a behind the scenes documentary on the English production, an interview with director Sunao Katabuchi, textless opening and closings, and Funimation trailers. The show comes in at a total runtime of 660 minutes and wears a very appropriate TV MA (mature, 17+) rating.

Language options are standard sub & dub with both an English dub and original Japanese soundtrack (either of which is presented in Dolby Digital 2.0) & the choice of English subtitled if so inclined to turn them on.

The show, for those who have yet to experience it, has a distinctly Asian-movie quality about it. While graphic violence segments are often retained from the manga source material, the core of the show's uniqueness comes in the form of spectacular feats of physical display during the intense and frequently occurring battles. Think slow-motion back handsprings to avoid a stream of dangerously spinning blades ala John Woo.

Fantastic visuals aside, the story shows several moments of gang-driven brilliance throughout. Rather than focus on a single character's trials and tribulations, the Black Lagoon saga is known for its penchant for popping around on several seemingly disconnected story arcs, which are ultimately tied together pretty nicely. The first season introduced viewers to the Lagoon Company, which was essentially a band of mercenaries who smuggled goods in and around the waterfronts of Southeast Asia in the 1990s. As expected with a group of pirates, the team were often placed into a wide variety of scenarios which included violent firefights, hand-to-hand combat (with gleaming blades a plenty), and nautical battles that would, of late, fit right in on the headlines of the news. When not involved in death-defying blood baths, the members of Lagoon Company could often be found scheming on the stools of The Yellow Flag, a shady bar in Roanapur.

I bring up events of the past because the first season made it quite clear that while Lagoon Company does business with a wide variety of clients from many nations, they are particularly friendly relationship with a Russian crime syndicate by the name of Hotel Moscow. The Second Barrage sets up the story of a string of disturbing murders taking place where twin killers appear to be targeting members of Hotel Moscow.

Without giving too much away, the plot this time around follows three story threads that delicately dance around one another but all progress toward the greater goal of getting to the bottom of the string of murders in question.

Often criticized for its violent content and heavy existentialistic-themes, the truth about Black Lagoon is that true enjoyment is often the result of zoning out and simply enjoying the nearly endless and incredibly cool action segments (one guy can slice a fired bullet in two with a swipe of his katana- it doesn't get cooler than that).

English dub work is solid although the emotion and intensity level is superior in the original Japanese soundtrack. The only problem with viewing the subtitled version is that reading the text can often distract from the lightening-fast action taking place at any given moment.

In all, Black Lagoon The Complete Box Set is a welcomed release of a well-regarded franchise with enough new twists and turns to keep viewers (both experienced and new to the show alike) glued to the set. It's not for everyone, however, as the show is littered with adult-themes, violence, and gore.

Fans of action-driven story telling, scantily clad women with big guns, and action sequences that are often superior to big-budget Hollywood feature films, reserve a space on your shelf for Black Lagoon.  An extra star for Funimation's decision to slap it all together into an 8-disc volume (6 discs plus 2 worth of bonus material) all for a little more than the individual seasons have been selling for.",1252972800,119,4971,5.105911330049261

The action is superb, minimal fan service, definitely not for kids because of language, gore/violence, sexual situations, etc...but NOTHING is out of place.  This is a great series for nearly any fan - age 16+.  I've had the DVD box sets for years now and will still upgrade to the BR because one simply cannot own enough ""Black Lagoon""!  I am still lying in wait for the remainder to come out in the US through Funimation starting with Roberta's Blood Trail - please bring this to life as well!!!

3882212,5,B0029XFQF0,"Black Lagoon is an awesome anime that parodies action movies of the 1980s. Set in an outlaw city where crime is the law and only the baddest asses make it and inroduces the multitude of colorful characters that inhabit it. And the dub is perfect. Lot's of gunfightis and high-octane fueled action and hot, badass chicks. Their are lots of things hollywood could learn from this Anime. The first season starts out as easy black and grey morality. But by the second season there will be plenty of tragedy, and viewers will find themselves starcrossed which will be more common throughout the series. The most tragic example was the heartbreaking death of disturbed, Romanian Twins that me and many fans wish had lived and made the show more epic.

They were named Hansel and Gretel who grew up in one of Nicolae Ceaucesc's state-run orphanages as a result of banned abortions. After said dictator was booted off his throne, they along with other orphans were sold to the Italian Mafia and forced to star in child snuff films. They were tortured, raped and even forced to kill other children to entertain their sadistic audience until they broke as a survival mechanism and were molded in their tormentors image. Just when the main protagonist and messiah rekindled their forsaken humanity they were cruelly killed. Their sadism is overshadowed by their beyond, tragic upbringing. They're story is comparable to Stephen King's Carrie White. Both are terrified, angry, young souls that lash out at their cruel world only to trampled by cruel strokes of fate.",1295308800,,1554,4.931297709923665
3882213,5,B0029XFQF0,"Black Lagoon blasts the violent, illicit, and international side of the world to people sitting at home. You'll be impressed by this anime's content and violence. It constantly shoots a diverse variety of realistic characters and settings such as modern day pirates, Russian mafia composed of former Soviet special forces, Triads, mercenaries, and sin cities. It reveals a lot about the world that you don't see on the news even on Al Jazeera. Thus, Black Lagoon is a very realistic and relevant anime.",1294790400,,502,5.0602409638554215

It's a fun ride and the message about commitment is interesting.  Good animation, enjoyable characters, fun story arcs.
It's not super deep in any particular area, but it is worth experiencing.  More existential than first viewing might suggest.

8358510,4,B0029XFQF0,"Black Lagoon is a fun, over-the-top, dark, action anime series. The series is 5 out of 5 stars, if you don't take it too seriously and you just let yourself be entertained by all the action.

This DVD set contains all of season 1 and 2 of the Black Lagoon anime in both Japanese and English dubs with an English subtitle option. Rosita's Blood Trail is not included in this set. There are 2 special features discs. They have a short interview with the guys behind the English release, a music video for the band that did the opening, textless opening and closing credits, and promo materials. I wish they had a cast commentary or bloopers, like the Claymore and 90's Berserk DVDs. And, the DVD cases are the ultra slim type, which I like for storage purposes, but they have a tendency to break easily. You'll probably need to get a wallet for the discs, if you don't want them sliding around inside the plastic cases because the thing that holds them in place broke.

So, for the DVD set itself, I give it a 4 out of 5 stars.",1480636800,,1025,4.361256544502618

8358515,5,B0029XFQF0,"This is not kids' fare in any way, shape or form despite being animated. If you're a fan of live-action action films with wicked women all up in charge, this is a great anime for you! The plot gives action Hollywood a huge run for its money and due to its unique slant, beats the latest from them by a mile! The artwork and voices are equally excellent, making you nearly forget you're watching anime. Voice work is very well done, especially by the women! It's not heavy on fanservice at all, and the women have earned their place in the environment plotwise. The one drawback is Rock, the main male character, seems a little Mary Sue but given his introduction to the realm of Roannapur, also not given much choice on making his way through the blood and chaos. Also check out Roberta's Blood Trail, the OVA accomaniment based on a character from one of the best story sets in this series. It's not for your kids any more than an R-rated action film, but if you think your teen can handle it that's your call. YMMV.",1449014400,,1017,4.414893617021277

8358517,5,B0029XFQF0,"The price is very good for the complete series and is a smart buy.

Black Lagoon hooked me before the first episode was over. The series has attitude that you don't see in very many anime and it really leaves an impression on you. Some people say it's just like Cowboy Bebop and while there are some similarities when you see it for the first time you can tell Black Lagoon is its own series.  The characters all have their own identity, everyone has so much personality that you really get to know them even if you don't know their full history. The stories that take place are all very interesting and draw you in but never feel to long mostly lasting three or four episodes. On a technical level the animation is done wonderfully and the English dub is perfectly matched to these characters.

Overall If you're a fan I highly recommend picking this up and if you've never seen Black Lagoon before I still recommend you check it out.",1410652800,,935,4.456140350877193
