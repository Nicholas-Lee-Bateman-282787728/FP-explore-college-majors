Very informative, and great drama. I would recommend this to all, it is a learning experience to watch.",1199232000,,274,4.288461538461538
2923607,5,B000UP8822,"I really got into this show. I wanted to know how everyone turned out, and that they all were safe in the end. One thing that really bugs me, is the bleeping of the swear words. Just like Ramsey's Kitchen shows. This is the man and this is how he talks. These are plain, rough, hard working guys and this is how they talk to each other and probably around their homes, unless the ""little Woman"" puts a clamp on them. Let it go, or at least on the dvd's an uncut/ uncensored version should be offered. Just like Rap music, they would probably find the uncut/uncensored would sell tons more that the annoyingly bleeped version. If it is bleeped, I won't be buying it. sorry folks. Some of the guys say they are being reconized down here in the lower 48, but this show hasn't been shown yet in Canada, so they are not reconized yet in their own stomping grounds. A way better live show than bogus Survivor... This is Really for Real. A+++",1199232000,17,935,4.318181818181818

2923609,5,B000UP8822,"These movies are about how truck drivers take huge risks to deliver supplies across large frozen bodies of water to areas in Canada. The dangers, feelings, attitudes and accomplishments involved. Battling awful freezing weather. Real life people not acting to earn a years wage in just a few months.

2923610,3,B000UP8822,"I wanted to like this video and watched all of it, but these guys swearing  - in some parts every other word is bleeped out, so if you have children you can't enjoy it as much.",1196726400,3,176,3.888888888888889
2923611,5,B000UP8822,"I don't typically watch live television (TIVO) but I happened to catch one episode of Ice Road Truckers to see what the hype was all about and fell flat out in LOVE with these men.  I really like big trucks anyway and am debating getting a CDL so I found it extremely interesting to see some of what goes on in the frozen world of cargo hauling.  This is a must see for everyone.  I also sell cable and tell many of my customers to watch this show and have had call backs from them raving....once again LOVE this show.  I am ordering this first season now for my parents, if they can watch NASCAR I am sure they will enjoy this more than I did.",1189382400,3,644,4.087301587301587

2923613,5,B000UP8822,"For me, the greatest thing in science fiction is the positive portrayal of working class folks. Here they are in real life, in a very well-done series.

The truckers are really good guys, and their forays onto the ice roads are true adventures. The videographers share the danger, and the ups and downs of the 2-months when the lakes are frozen and the trucks try to get everything to the Canadian diamond mines before the ice melts again.

I think it's a nice touch that they put the most unassuming character on the cover!",1187740800,16,524,4.5638297872340425

2923642,5,B000UP8822,"I happened to catch an episode and became obsessed! I had to see this from the beginning, so I got the first season asap and sat down for what turned out to be about three hours to watch these guys making trips across the ice roads over frozen lakes and rivers. They drive trailer trucks loaded with tons of cargo across 36"" of ice...they hope. The roads melt at the end of six weeks and the truckers (who we get to know very, very well) compete for the load count lead. I learned about trucks and truckers, and a little about myself i guess. By the way, this isn't just a guy thing...my wife and I both love the show; she sees things about the people and I am all about the trucks and the roads. The camera crews are extraordinary and the graphics fill you in on the details nicely. You can't miss with this show!",1347148800,,814,4.191082802547771

2923644,5,B000UP8822,"This movie is being played right now. Freaking awesome! Watched all 4 seasons on Netflix and decided I wanted it in my movie collection. Watched it the first time and I was on the edge of my seat just watching these men drive out onto the thin, cracking ice with loads weighing up to more than 40,000 pounds as an average. Every turn of the corner, I was like, ""OMG, I would NOT want to be out there!"" These men are all heroes, but reading plenty of the negative reviews made them look otherwise.

Let me just say this to those little whiners about the ""language"" content. Wake the hell up! These guys are out there for 2 months in freezing weather risking their lives on each bend in the road, every crack the ice makes, never knowing WHAT condition the road will ever be in, whether their truck will break down or their trailer falling through the ice. I have personally seen the trucker life myself, and have seen what truckers have to do to get a paycheck for the families they barely ever get to see. Meanwhile, the critics that whine about their bad language are all 9-to-5 idiots with cushy and comfy jobs and couldn't last FIVE MINUTES in the kind of stressful climate and job demands these truckers have, so if you don't want to hear the bleeps from their bad language, then shut the hell up and watch something else. Put on a Christian cartoon movie for you and your kids to watch if you have such ""virgin ears.""

As for my review on this movie, I think the guys are all great in their own way. Hugh is pretty demanding on his trucker crews, but I've had bosses just as demanding as him, and his words of advice(swears included)pretty much show his style on how he's survived ice-road trucking since the 1980's. I like that he shows how he stays awake on long, tiring runs, which makes him come out on top each time as the ""Polar Bear."" Alex is cool, and becomes to be known as the funny Canadian with the hilarious laugh, with 30 years of trucking on his belt, his determination to stay cool in a bad situation, and his longing to help support an enormous family nearby at home. The other guys are pretty good, especially the one with the little girl at home that he rarely sees, but it's Drew that I kinda feel sorry for. He seems to expect everything to go smoothly with his runs, but gets plagued with breakdowns all the time and ends up quitting from all the built-up stress of staying in a motel and losing over $1000 a day. He comes back in Season 2, though, and I wonder if he'll be on any of the seasons to come.

Looking forward to the new season being made about the ice roads in Manitoba! And the ice-road veterans will surely have a lot to learn there even after all their experiences on the dangerous roads in Canada and Alaska.",1315526400,,2752,4.339805825242719
2923645,2,B000UP8822,"Because this came with high reviews from friends and viewers we decided to purchase. But one season will be enough for me; it just repeats, and repeats...on and on.  After you have watched one item, they skip onto something else, then come back and 'rehash' everything you just watched. While the show itself could have been so interesting, they took so much away. The material is fascinating and the men that do this kind of work are a totally different breed and I admire that. However, these shows could have been cut down to one disc and been far more entertaining.  I will not purchase other seasons.",1302652800,,605,4.644859813084112

2923647,4,B000UP8822,"I love the Ice Road Truckers series on TV and I love the DVD release. But you would expect it to be unedited without the all famous ""BLEEPS"". I thought that if you buy a DVD release it would be unedited with all the swearing...but no.

2923649,3,B000UP8822,"I enjoyed learning about ""Ice Road Truckers"" a job I had no idea existed.  But after watching the first few trips, and the same CG footage of a truck breaking through the ice over and over again, I was pretty bored.  Since the truckers ride the road alone there is none of the comraderie or humor of ""The Deadliest Catch"".  It was ok to watch one season but by Episode 4 I was only watching it to see if they were able to transport all the orders.",1253318400,3,447,4.114942528735632
2923650,5,B000UP8822,"Wow! this whole series was just fantastic-I couldn't stop watching it! The men who drive the ice road are so brave and unique and interesting. You have your favorites-mine was Alex, the father of 11 children-very nice person. And, least is Hugh-mean-spirited to his employees-he is all about money and not human safety. Rick is a big-whiner, Jay is a remarkable young man and TJ,too. Very interesting. Great gift,too.",1249776000,,417,5.057971014492754

It is an interesting show, but after awhile it did become a little repetitive. I know they are trying to make each episode exciting and engaging, but I would have liked perhaps a few episodes where you concentrated on maybe only two of the drivers and went much more in-depth with a specific run, instead of trying to go back and forth between the 4-5 drivers, with a little information on each of them. Still, a good show and one I enjoyed watching multiple times.",1241481600,,579,4.321100917431193
2923653,1,B000UP8822,"The bleeped out language in this DVD is disgusting and completely unnecessary.  I can't believe this was accepted and aired on the History Channel.  Poor choice on their part, big time!  If the language would have been excluded all together, instead of bleeped out, the producers of this series and the History Channel undoubtedly would have been able to attract a greater viewing audience.

2923655,2,B000UP8822,"I was very excited about this series when I ordered them. Unfortuntaly the series is not very documentary, but more of a fictional dramatized character. It seems the producers have tried to dramatize something that is just not there. Big, Spectacular, Over-dramatized are all words that fit the series.

The rest of this first series, was fantastic and I have watch some of them, over and over again!!! They are of a very similar scarey action, as was Deadliest Catch, of which I also bought the full series, from Amazon. The very LARGE numbers ""beeps"" in the Ice Road Truckers, does take away the true sense of the stories, so we just have to endure that, we guess!!!! We did have to purchase a later brand of DVD Player, to be able to play the Ice Road Truckers, because of being in a different Zone, but we had to watch them, somehow and this was a small price to pay.

It also tells the story of a determined driver and abusive truck-owner (Hugh) who continually outsmarts himself by failing to provide well-maintained equipment for his drivers, blaming them instead for breakdowns, and losing lots of money as a result.",1210032000,,462,5.16
2923661,5,B000UP8822,"I happened to see a tiny bit of the first episode while waiting for the barber, and I was hooked.  This is a great series.

I hardly would have imagined the degree to which I would be interested in a profession and geographical location about which I know nothing and would hardly be concerned with, generally.  This material is a study in human endurance, sheer force of will, struggle against unbelievably harsh and cruel natural forces, and lots of human interaction through all the mess.

For someone who is totally unfamiliar with this series, it focuses on roughly a half dozen truckers (out of about 800) who move extremely heavy, valuable, and hazardous loads across hundreds of miles of ice lakes during the roughly two month winter season when the temperatures reach -40 degrees, F.  A breakdown or a ""fender bender"" can become a life-threatening situation.  The pressure is increased because of the very short time period in which the ice is stable for supporting the trucks, and mechanical breakdowns, common enough at any temperature, become freakishly ever-present at these extreme temperatures, fueling friction between the truckers, their families, and producing lots of material for the series.

At times the series borders on overdoing the drama with excessive narration and the occasional ""looping"" of crucial events, but it hardly detracts from the real drama.

Overall, it's a riveting slice of life that is exceptionally well produced and packaged.  I think you'll be glad you invested your time in this, whether or not a ""trucking series"" sounds interesting to you.",1207699200,,1588,5.100386100386101

I really enjoyed Rick, T.J. Hugh, Alex and all those brave/crazy truckers who made you feel like you were there in the truck with them.

Tanks You Historia!",1202860800,,102,4.1
2923667,5,B000UP8822,"First, some technical notes.  I have no problems watching this with my Sony DVD player hooked up to a Vizio 32"" LCD TV.  Everything shows up the way its supposed to.  Maybe the guy with the problems doesn't have his TV or other equipment set up right, or maybe he's not using the right hook-ups. I dunno. It works great for me.

As for the bleeping, I appreciate that they kept it in.  I am a truck driver by trade, and though I do not talk that way, I encounter many that do.  With having a 3 year old and a 2 year old in the house, I am able to enjoy the series with them around.  Little ears do not need to hear that kind of language.  They'll get it soon enough.  Besides, anyone who watches the show with brain engaged can very easily figure out what is being bleeped out.  Its not worth the effort, though.

Now for the product review.  The whole ""reality TV"" angle annoys me a little and I think it detracts from the whole show. I know it sells, but playing up the dramatics is a bit over the top, I think.  However, if any reality TV show can actually be called real then this show is the closest you'll be able to get.

After watching it, I want to go up there and drive the ice.  Not for the money, but for the experience.  It looks great.  Bring on the cold!  However, my wife is dead set against it. I'll keep working on her, though, and maybe you'll see ME in a future documentary!

The show does leave me with a few questions which they never answer. Are the Canadian DOT rules suspended for this period and for this location?  Where do they acquire their food and how much does it cost?  How much diesel do they burn on the various trips?  And last but not least: How does Hugh get his trucks home?

Overall, though, I cannot recommend the show enough.  It shows what we truck drivers go through on a regular basis, albeit in a far more extreme and dangerous environment.  Watch it! Get engrossed in it! Love it!",1202515200,3,1927,4.171195652173913

This is one of the better little jewels to come along in a while. I liken it to the Deadliest Catch series, not in terms of danger and risk (nothing can top DC for that), but because it is one of those small little-known niche jobs that relatively few know about, has been going on for decades, and to a newcomer like this reviewer, is just jaw-dropping.

For a time there was a forum on the IRT website for fans to discuss this show. I was able to read it for roughly one week before history.com pulled it. It was surprising to see several individuals, each claiming they worked the Ice Roads or lived in the vicinity, venting their anger over this show. They complained about the ""hyping"" done by the show in order to garner viewers, making the truckers out to be something they are not, and leaving out some key individuals and companies who made Ice Roads a reality. None of their arguments seemed plausible to me. Nevertheless, it did raise a question about the season I had just watched.

As someone who has never driven BUT HAS rode in a semi while pulling a load, if anyone challenged me with the chance to earn some good bucks for two month's worth of hauling loads, BUT, ""there's one thing: You will be hauling 25 to 50 ton loads across ice covered lakes, with sub-zero conditions."", I would tell them they were insane.

That is the real point, and that's what makes this an awesome series. If there was any hype or leaving something out, it was never peceivable to this reviewer. In fact, when you actually ""see"" a tanker truck sitting there, with its rear wheels sunk three feet into the ice, any arguments made about hype is made null and void. True, they do have IR trucking down to a science now, with the accident rate being close to that on asphalt; however that IS MENTIONED on the DVDs. Even if the risk was zero, it would not dampen the thoughts of ""what if"". It has happened before.

Also mentioned in the forums were discussions about the locals being unhappy with the show's producers---so much so that the conflict may result in the show not coming back again. If so, this is one viewer who would miss it. That being said, if you visit the IRT pages on history.com, there is no mention of a Season 2. For those who have never seen it, if you like reality-type shows, I recommend that you purchase this sight unseen. You will not be dissappointed.

Finally, regarding the technical issues I have experienced with History Channel DVD's, I DO have my equipment connected correctly, and THERE ARE very large black borders around the picture. I actually have about 4 (our of 375 single/box-sets) with this same problem. Two are from the History Channel. Either most people do not notice this, and/or they do not consider it a nuisance, and/or it occurs only with a small number of equipment configurations. It is a peeve however---if anyone reading this has any resources to research the issue, I would appreciate it.

This is an early review, primarily technical.

Having just finished the first DVD of the collection, my first reaction is one of disgust. This is the second DVD series I've purchased with the ""History Channel"" logo (the other is ""The Race To The Moon""). Each is in widescreen format, however it is minimized on my television---there are thick 6 to 10 inch black borders surrounding the image on every side. Zooming the image, either via the TV or the DVD player, cause the image to be cropped significantly around every edge of the image.

What's up with this? The results are the same on my Sony and Samsung DVD players. The only other DVD with this problem in my collection is Independence Day. Note that my collection comprises roughly 375 DVD's.

The actual show is awesome, and I hope to return later and focus on that, however this problem is extremely irritating and worthy of warning the rest of you potential buyers.

2923673,5,B000UP8822,"Seriously, as soon as I started an episode I'd find myself crushed into the corner of the couch all clenched up with my jaw locked.  The pucker factor is as high as it gets for a TV series.  When the guys rolled onto the ice, pulling the huge teetering loads while the ice below them cracked like celophane I couldn't breath.  I was in my safe little abode -I can't even begin to imagine what it must be like sitting in the cab. These guys are nuts - big, crazy, rolling eyed maniacs. And I'm a voyeur -just sitting here waiting for them to crash - not really wanting it to happen but unable to look away.  Oh lord, what have I become?  bg",1199664000,,639,4.120967741935484

8214225,4,B000UP8822,"Season One is the better than season two. The second season has the truckers driving over SEA ICE which is more stable and thicker. They drive much faster and I got through a couple of discs of a re-watch and I got bored and I've been on the computer for weeks instead. Too much more to do that to watch boring season two. The show has a formula. Drew is the fool and was for at least two seasons. Rick Yem was characterized as a wanna be trucker when in reality Hugh (The Polar Bear) Roland who Rick worked for had trucks that needed to be serviced and the truckers who worked for him SUFFERED. Anyway, it's a REALITY show and nothing here is quite TRUE or REAL. It's just TELEVISION. So sit back and enjoy it for what it is. Who knew truckers drove over lakes and the ocean. I like this sort of reality show, it and AX Men, Survivorman, and Bear Grill's show as well. I enjoy these real life working man shows.",1472774400,,912,4.1875
