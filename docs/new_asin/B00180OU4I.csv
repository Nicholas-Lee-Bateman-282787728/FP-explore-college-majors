8268212,3,B00180OU4I,"Really, I bought this video for one reason: a personal favorite of mine had a cameo ( lasting about 1 minute ) in this production. However THAT minute made the purchase worthwhile. The movie itself was 'straight to video"" so, ""it is, what it is"".
There is some recognizable talent in the film and they do all right with the material they are given. A slightly different take on
the old "" Jekyll and Hyde "" theme. It's not totally a waste but as I said before, I was in this to see Anais and SHE ROCKED!!!",1348876800,,504,4.206185567010309
8268213,1,B00180OU4I,"This movie is beyond bad: the concept is completely unoriginal, the script vapid and ridiculous, and the acting 100% unbelievable. Unless you're a student in your first video-arts class looking for examples of what not to do for your first project, don't waste your time on this movie.",1298505600,,285,4.958333333333333
8268214,2,B00180OU4I,"Matt Keeslar is Dr. Henry Jekyll, intelligent and brilliant scientist whose new method for curing diseases - creating his alter ego Edward Hyde through computer-generated ""avatar"" and downloading it directly into brain - goes terribly wrong. The mild-mannered doctor changes into hedonistic Mr. Hyde, chasing after dancers and engages in a brawl with bouncers. Alanna Ubach plays Michelle who cares for him while Jonathan Silverman is Dr. Lanyon, an old friend who worries about Jekyll. Desmond Askew also appears as Ziggy, Jekyll's assistant.

The storyline of this modern-day adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's famous novella is actually based on the 1931 version starring Frederic March, still the best version of the story. One big difference here is of course the doctor's strange scientific experiment which looks very silly to me, with the devices that look exactly like video games you have in your home.

The transformation from Jekyll to Hyde itself happens off-screen and it is not shown to us. Considering the efforts required for special makeup, the decision is understandable. But the costume of Mr. Hyde (and Matt Keeslar's overacting) is something different. It is outrageous, and instantly turns the film into an unintentional comedy. Sporting ridiculously huge sideburns, Edward Hyde (wearing a cape) is a lady's man.

There is a twist in the second half (Jekyll conducts the experiment on another character). Things don't improve, however, and they only get messier. By the time I get to this point, I lost whatever interest I had in the story.",1255737600,2,1567,5.26
8268215,2,B00180OU4I,"I'm a sucker for classic horror, particularly the familiar but poignant case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  In fact, I've even thought about writing my own take on the immortal tale.  If I ever do, I'll be careful to make it as totally unlike this disappointing production as possible.

The premise, if a little offbeat, is still promising.  The unorthdox (and very self-centered) Dr. Jekyll discovers a way to download computer viruses directly into the human brain, a discovery which the ""good"" doctor hopes will lead to major breathroughs in human medicine.  Unfortunately, the virus he tests on himself turns out to be the incarnation of a rather unsavory character called Edward Hyde, and before long Hyde is taking Jekyll places he never dared to go before.  Soon, Jekyll's impending marriage is threatened and he's drawn by his unscrupulous alter ego into a bizarre relationship with an enigmatic stripper.  Can Jekyll's friends save him from himself before it's too late?

The plot, weird as it is, isn't the problem.  Or at least not the biggest one.  I could handle a computer-generated Hyde, but this movie's concept of him never works.  He is dangerous, but he's also campy and ridiculous.  Basically a walking cartoon, this version of Hyde is just a parody of the real thing.  Jekyll himself isn't much better--he's a selfish, immature jerk who never stops to think of the consequences of his actions and for whom it's difficult to ever muster the least bit of sympathy.

Production values aren't great either, and are particularly disappointing in the several action scenes, which are badly choreographed and too unconvincing to generate any excitement.  The script is muddled and the dialogue is often agonizing.  At least the gore is limited, as the filmmakers apparently aspired to make a more character-driven modern horror film as opposed to a gorefest.  That's laudable--though some will consider it another mark against it--but unfortunately the drama never comes to life with any authority.  There aren't many special effects, and while there didn't really need to be a lot of FX the transformation scenes between Jekyll and Hyde are hokey and unintentionally humorous.

It's a pity this movie isn't at least a little better than it is, because certain elements of the script and the general tone of the production suggest some hard work and forethought.  Unfortunately, the overall package just doesn't fit together.  Hampered by a badly-written Hyde, unsympathetic characters, and lackluster production values, JEKYLL fails on almost every level.",1216857600,8,2568,5.139759036144579
