5962745,4,B00F1BFYKE,"This film is not perfect, but it is funny. James Coburn and Carroll O'Connor are both fun to watch. Their actions are sometimes ridiculous, but this adds to the fun. There is the scene, for example, where Coburn is threatened with a pistol duel against a man who could easily beat him, but similar to Raiders of the Lost Ark, he stands at a distance and shoots the man with a rifle before he can reach for his gun. Another scene has Coburn steal items from O'Connor, who is the town sheriff and locks him in a cell naked to stop him because of embarrassment to call out for help. What is disturbing is that Coburn rapes O'Connor's daughter and O'Connor does not care, and the daughter falls in love with Coburn during the rape.",1403136000,,727,4.392592592592592

5962776,3,B00F1BFYKE,"I recently downloaded after watching Coburn in another film. It's low comedy. By which I mean the film's primary purpose is provoking laughter through various means. In this respect the film possesses merit. However you might be uncomfortable with its attitude to women. Well, you must remember it was made in the Sixties over forty years ago. Attitudes have been changing then & now. Still I thought then & now that they could have done a better job with Billy in the storyline. Someone who should have made an appearance earlier in the film as a lover, would have been better. When we first meet Coburn he's completely bored with his life. Billie is the only thing tying him down until he finds the map & knows something better is ahead and jilts her. He may be bored with her but she isn't finished with him. She should be outraged & planning to catch up with him. She may know nothing about his plans but she knows her man will be passing through Madam's when he gets the opportunity. Unlike the Sherriff racing after him she plans to cut him off at the pass. When Claude Akins brings the shoemaker to the House she learns the story & knows where Akins left him. Her appearance, when both men are tied up, makes more sense. Why cut their bonds? She could be easily teasing Coburn. What brings him this way? She would know everything else and about everybody else. More than enough to get him back? How does that old adage go? Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. However the producer was impatient for laughs and making her the Sherriff's daughter would do just fine. There simply was too little thought about the plot which is a shame. Coburn & O'Connor put in a fine job. Hey, even the cast was good. Nevertheless this film underperformed. It needed better writing but what can you do? The industry put together quite a few films for a quick profit which helped cover losses from the flops or increase the profits. It's an okay film. Hollywood got their money and people got their laughs.",1419811200,,2013,4.502732240437158
