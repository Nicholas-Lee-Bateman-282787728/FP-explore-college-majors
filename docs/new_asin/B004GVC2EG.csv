4374262,4,B004GVC2EG,"This two DVD set is quite good.  The video quality of 'Power of The Will' is excellent.  The video itself is quite spectacular showing the greatest Nazi celebrations of the time.  I will never get sick of watching it.
Unfortunately the video quality of ""Olympia"" is not so good, just an average copy from VHS.  I actually have an off air recording of the first part which has a much higher video quality.  The video is quite entertaining and offers great shots with good composition, camera work and sound.
The two DVDs come in a nice tin red box with a 3D printing of the swastica.

Yet some people were able to see through this devil. How one man can brutally annihilate so many people is beyond me. How those that did the dastardly evils were able to follow his orders is even worst. And some of those cowards are still living among us! :(",1305676800,3,435,4.253012048192771
4374264,3,B004GVC2EG,"If you are looking for an inexpensive set of these two films, then this is the set to buy. Both films are watchable, but sometimes the picture will be dark, grainy, and slightly out of focus. The subtitles with ""Triumph of the Will"" are not the best, and there are no subtitles at all with ""Olympia.""

The picture quality of ""Olympia"" is not as good as ""Triumph of the Will."" The sound with both of these films seems to be okay. There are better versions of these films on the market, with better picture quality and subtitles, but they are more expensive. If you just want to watch these films and not spend much money, then this is set will do.

I'm going to leave the bulk of social and political commentary about these two films to other reviewers. However, I will say this: I'm no fan of Hitler, his evil empire, and his chosen filmmaker. But these two films should be seen as educational documents of what the Allied forces fought against and finally crushed during World War II.",1303776000,43,985,4.466666666666667

4374266,5,B004GVC2EG,"'Triumph of the Will' really shows the power Hitler had over the German people in the 1930's before WWII, they worshiped him almost as a god. You really get the feeling like you are almost there with them.
What is amazing is how much good Hitler did for Germany during the Great Depression. He could have gone down as a great leader in history but instead we all know how he lied to the people and had plans of conquest and the killing of millions of people. Video and sound quality are very good and I highly recomend for anyone who enjoys 1930s history before WWII. Also the 2nd. disc is 'Olympia' with lots of film footage of the Berlin Olympics with Hitler shown in the stands watching the games, this 2nd disc is very interesting but very long.",1302739200,36,749,4.39568345323741

4374268,5,B004GVC2EG,"Be forewarned that Olympia carries no subtitles. Hence, if you don't understand German you won't be able to figure out who won what.  But visually and technically it is still ages ahead of its time and Jesse Owens or the other African American athletes trouncing the super Aryans look just as gorgeous now as they did 80 years ago.
To me, Triumph of the Will is just as much an insight into Hitler, seen in many stances from the slightly amused to whipping up hysteria in a NSDAP congress hall, as in those days social media did not exist in the forms we know it today.
What a waste for Riefenstahl to have been associated with this gang. But then, had Germany won the war and the USSR been defeated, the roles between her and Eisenstein would have been reversed. Beyond propaganda and the nature of both regimes, studios are not willing to finance such an artistic and technical risk.

4374284,5,B004GVC2EG,"In ""Triumph of Will"" we see the Third Reich through its own eyes, without distracting commentary from someone with a political agenda trying to shout down the message.  The Nazi party's government was fantastically popular in the 1930's and we see a strong emphasis on the reasons for this--they were able to get the people of Germany back on their feet and restored the national pride that the French had been viciously attempting to undermine (a habit of the French that dates back to Napoleon, well-documented in the Arc de Triomphe).

We also see that at least for some politicians, the methods never change.  There is a huge, relentless barrage of propaganda, emphasis on pageantry and symbolism, and an undercurrent of hate messages all delivered by the mass media of the time.

""Olympia"" is a detailed documentary of the Berlin Olympic games with all the spectacle and sports you would expect, delivered without all the 21st century editorializing and historical revisionism that we have to suffer through today.

The original production values are very good for their period and my copy of these DVD's was an excellent reproduction, the best I've ever seen from films from this period.",1451347200,11,1193,5.005050505050505

4374296,5,B004GVC2EG,"For anyone interested in Germany in the thirties and the Hitler regime, these are two extremely interesting films. Triumph shows the fanaticism of the Hitler following. This movie was filmed after Rohm and some of the leaders of the SA, were assassinated under Hitler's orders. Hitler makes an indirect reference to these events in the movie, saying something like ""We all know the shadows or misfortunes the the Nazi Party has gone through recently."" Apparently the film had to be edited to do away with all references to Ernst Rohm, who as head of the SA was an extremely important, and so therefore had been part of the film. Strangely there are no anti-semitic references in the Hitler speeches of this movie. Amazing how this little, serf-centered, mediocre, lower middle class German should have had so much success. Nothing interesting, intellectual, original or of depth in all these Hitler speeches.
Olyimpia, the story of the 1936 Olympic Games that were held in Berlin, is also interesting. Hitler was disappointed and only came to the opening ceremonies, and never returned. Disappointed because the ""Master race"" did not do all that well in those games. And the real hero was the great Jesse Owens who won the 100, 200, 400 meters and long jump events.

I am 68, and all of this ended just seven months before I was born. When I look at the people in Triumph of the Will, what I see is not just mass hysteria but mass insanity; they have the look in their eyes of true fanatics, which is the last thing so many of their victims saw. This movie was filmed about a year after the Nuremburg Laws began, and what is not visible is the falling of night on the Jews in Germany; Kristallnacht came about three years later.

Although this was a propaganda film meant to put the Nazis in a good light, if one looks closely, the murderous energy is showing through. Even though we say 'never again', it doesn't hurt to keep one eye open.",1393804800,5,883,4.319277108433735

4374323,2,B004GVC2EG,"Triumph of the Will is actually a Remake of an earlier Reifenstahl movie 'Triumph of Faith' (Der Seig Des Glaubens) - showing the relationship of Hitler and the Founder of the Nazi party and leader of its Storm Troopers (SA) - meaning Hitlers Homo-Anal Coprophile Pederast Mentor / Boyfriend Ernst Rohm.

'Triumph of Belief' shows Rohm & Hitler as Co-Equals in the leadership (although Rohm was an Openly Notorious Coprophile Boy Rapist - he was also in charge of the Hitler Youth after his own Gaystapo destroyed the Boy Scouts) - while the SA parade by.

After the Inter-Party War / Purge between Rohm's Homosex SA Faction and Hitlers Homosex SS Faction led to the ""Night of the Long Knives"" assassination pogrom (and follow up assassinations by ""Rohm's Avengers"") - all mention of Rohm was removed and the earlier movie was recalled and re-shot using the victorious SS in place of the SA and showing Hitler alone in power.

This also led propaganda minister Goebbels to recruit a 'heterosexual mistress' (eva braun) for Hitler so as to deflect the stories about his own depraved romps with the SA Leadership. However, as has been verified through first hand sources on his personal staff - Hitler and Braun Never had any sexual relationship...

Except perhaps for some encounters with Hitlers shared penchant with Rohm for Coprophile Behaviors - which may have had something to do with the Suicide of Hitlers Niece and Braun's Attempts to kill herself.

Sooooo... I recommend getting Both Triumph of the Will and Of Belief for comparison of the evolution of the Homo-Nazi Reich - as the one follows the other as Dachau followed the Homo-Nazi takeover that Destroyed the Boy Scouts and put Rohm in charge of Dachau

4374336,5,B004GVC2EG,Great movies! Triumph of the will was directed by a woman and showed for the first time footage taken from the air for extended time in film history. Epic achievement for the 1930's.,1322265600,,182,4.545454545454546
4374337,5,B004GVC2EG,"The theme repeated again and again is: ""Mein Fuhrer, we are loyal to you."" As an historical film, it is still very interesting. Even though the Nazis got about 40% per cent of the vote in the 1932 elections, the film tries to convey the idea that all Germany is with Hitler. In reality, the Nazis had to coerce the other 60% into going along with them.",1312329600,2,352,4.268656716417911

That pretty much defeats the purpose of watching it.",1497484800,2,323,4.785714285714286
