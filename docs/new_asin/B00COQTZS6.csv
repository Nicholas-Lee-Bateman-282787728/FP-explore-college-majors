8584047,4,B00COQTZS6,"THE STRANGLERS OF BOMBAY is something of a Hammer anamoly for when it was made (1959). Instead of being exotic and colorful, it's grim and monochromatic which is more suitable as it deals with the Thugee cult in India in the 19th century. This is certainly director Terence Fisher's most brutal film as it contains numerous burnings and mutilations which, for the time, are graphically visualized. STRANGLERS features a British army captain (Guy Rolfe, best known for William Castle's MR SARDONICUS) who takes on the murderous cult after his servant is killed while his superiors haven't a clue as to what is going on. There is a strong anti-colonial bent to the film as it criticizes how the British ran India. In one scene a British officer gets himself and his entire caravan murdered because of his upper class ignorance and rank stupidity.  Complete historical accuracy is hardly the movie's strong suit but then it isn't meant to be. It's also politically incorrect by today's standards. Nevertheless it's a solidly made historical drama with an unforgettable performance by George Pastell as the leader of the cult of Kali.

Since STRANGLERS is directed by Terence Fisher, who did most of Hammer's FRANKENSTEIN & DRACULA films, you know that good will ultimately triumph over evil but at a heavy cost. It also means that the movie is full of crisp editing and interesting camera work as well as moving at a brisk pace (it runs 80 minutes). There can be no question that this film influenced Steven Spielberg's INDIANA JONES & THE TEMPLE OF DOOM although the action here is historically based and is much darker in tone without a trace of humor. In the final analysis STRANGLERS is loaded with numerous images that are hard to erase. It is also full of memorable dialogue such as ""He is not our kind. I am Muslim, he is Hindu"" or ""Whoever rules decides the truth"" that seems just as true in the India and Pakistan of today as it did when the film was made. This release is a DVD-R taken from the 2008 Sony set ICONS OF ADVENTURE with the picture (don't forget it's filmed in ""Strangloscope""!) and sound of equal quality. A must for Hammer fans who wish to see something other than the Gothic horrors.",1406851200,3,2206,4.7272727272727275

""For hundreds of years a secret group dedicated itself to murder of strangers for the sake of Kali."" [Not good for the tourist industry?] Initiates are cut and branded. The British suffer from the heat and their poor judgment in clothing. [The defeat of the French in the 18th century made the British the rulers of India.] There are complaints about missing persons, and a loss of profits and taxes. Where could a caravan with all its people disappear to? The British must investigate this problem. ""It is an organized conspiracy"" says one man. Armed soldiers escort the caravan. Two thieves escape from the British but are caught by the followers of Kali and punished by blinding. A servant reports a missing person, and is sent in pursuit. One man is shown by the Thugs how to be accepted into a caravan for travel.

Captain Lewis is attacked in an alley to recover a piece of silk! Is this important? Back at home a body part is thrown through a window! What has the company done to stabilize the country? Is there danger in doing that? A religious conflict divides the people. Hunters stake out a goat to attract a tiger in the jungle. One man sees a mass grave with many bodies. A murder cult? ""Whoever rules decides the truth."" Does anybody care? A thief is caught; will he talk or be punished? A deal is made. The people at the hanging are joyful. Why? A snooper is caught and staked out for punishment. The smell of blood draws a venomous snake. But a mongoose kills this snake; this frees the Englishman. Captain Lewis reports this. The potter denies all. The initiates perform their task. There will be a large caravan of goods, there should be safety in numbers.

[These actions show a resistance to British colonialism.] Murders are planned to make it look like a robbery. Captain Lewis is not fooled by this attack. A double agent provides disinformation. [Note the use of camels for transportation.] Sleeping travelers are attacked and strangled. ""Wake up!"" Only Englishmen in tents survive. [That pistol dates to the late 19th century.] The corpses are taken away and put into a mass grave. Captain Lewis surmises what happened, and follows the tracks. Later he sees the group gathering. A funeral pyre is an offering. Captain Lewis escapes and warns the Colonel. ""He is one of them!"" Lewis is promoted. In the end thousands of thugs were punished for murdering a million people. One Thug claimed seven hundred victims.

One way to view the thugs is as an organized crime that robbed and killed their victims. They had the support of the local authorities. [Does this remind you of other times and places?] This is a dramatization, you will get better facts from a history book (if you can find one). Bombay is now called Mumbai. The actions of the Thugs seems similar to the resistance in WW II occupied Europe.",1375401600,2,2865,4.68986083499006
