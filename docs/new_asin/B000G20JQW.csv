8128705,4,B000G20JQW,"Showed two ""You Tube"" scenes from this movie to my granddaughters and blew their minds. The best scene is when ""Mom"" tries out for the band. The You Tube scenes disappeared (or changed.) Bought the movie. The editors cut part of the tryout sceneruined it. That's Bollywood for you. Still...",1381190400,,290,4.82
8128706,5,B000G20JQW,"This little movie with its predictable plot and familiar cast of characters (at least to semi-Bollywood) manages that magic event of cohering nicely into a well told tale which is refreshing and very engaging.  I have long loved traditional Indian music, including Carnatic, and I LOVE the music in this film.  The story's arc is nicely paced with the gradual mingling of modern and classical music, so that when the finale comes, it is the best moment in the movie, carrying both a stand-alone power and an emotional conclusion to the little tale. For those unfamiliar with fusion or Indian film proper, I can't think of a better place to start!",1198540800,,646,4.8108108108108105
8128707,5,B000G20JQW,"We watched this movie last weekend - I just happened to find it in Wikipedia as I was looking at Shabana Azmi's filmography. What makes this movie enjoyable is the music - it blends carnatic music and western nicely - both Bombay Jayashree and Sudha Raghunathan (both leading artistes of Carnatic music) have sung more or less throughout the film.

Shabana Azmi's acting is a delight to watch - the storyline is straight forward and the director deserves credit for keeping to a tight script.

The one odd thing about this film is that all the characters speak in English, even though the story is set in rural Andhra Pradesh in South India.

Definitely worth wathcing...",1172793600,4,671,4.767241379310345
8128708,5,B000G20JQW,"I know nothing about southern Indian music.  Having said that, the cinematography was outstanding, the opening few minutes were superb and grabbed me like every good movie should.  The music was wonderful to me.  One of this year's most enjoyable movies from my point of view.",1161648000,,276,4.956521739130435
8128709,1,B000G20JQW,Very poor casting by the director again. Shabana though a brilliant actress is all wrong as a carnatic singer. Her imitation of Sudha Raghunathan was pathetic at best. Here movement of head was artificial. Accent was all wrong. What happened are all the south Indian actresses dead. The other chick was pretty bad. Why didn't they pick Rekha or Hema malini or Jaya prada or suhasini or revati or sumalata or shobhana. A Gizillion other actresses would have played the lead role. Story was weak and fusion was bad in the music. Playing a different set of drums does not make good music. Sudha ragunathan's voice is wasted on a bad movie. Truly a discredit to the nightingale of India,1160870400,,682,4.691666666666666
