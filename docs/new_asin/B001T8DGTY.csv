It comes in 2 dvd cases, 5 discs each, double features on each disc & includes theatrical trailers in between. The quality of the pictures and sound are good no complaints! My favorites to watch out of the collection are sister street fighter, the bodyguard, and chain gang women. Worth buying!",1391644800,3,401,4.742857142857143

not sure if i'll try watching the others.  i bought this at Best Buy for about [..] and unfortunately, couldn't pass up a deal like this.  plus, i love the exploitation genre.  too bad most of these movies really [..].
