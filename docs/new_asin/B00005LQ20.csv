1623284,3,B00005LQ20,"The Hound of the Baskervilles, 2000 film

This story was published around 1900 and filmed many times. Arthur Conan Doyle died in the 1930s, his copyrights expired around 1970. Anyone can adopt his fictional characters and create new stories. This film follows the original story but makes some changes in the characterizations and to keep within budget: indoor shots to avoid recreating 1900 London, outdoor shots of the unchanging countryside, explaining away an electric wire. Sherlocks character is high strung and excited, as if on some medication. Dr. Watson is played as a calm older man who is living as a bachelor. Nigel Bruces characterization of the role set the standard. Nigel Bruce had a resemblance to the real A. C. Doyle. Sherlock was the worlds first consulting detective, an owner operator of his own business and not an employee of a business or government. Dr. Watson seems to be between jobs and serves as an aide and recorder of the events. This story was said to be based on an old country legend. Many of the stories contain references to the events of that time.

A semi retired Doctor Mortimer visits Sherlock Holmes to tell of the death of Sir Charles Baskerville. An heir from Canada will inherit the lands and title, but may be in danger. The new Sir Henry visits Sherlock and tells of a missing boot! What could this mean? Sherlock assigns Dr. Watson to accompany Sir Henry to his estate by Grimpen Moor and then report back by mail. Dr. Watson meets the people who live there, learns about the legend and the strange events. There is an added danger in an escaped lunatic murderer. The swamps are treacherous to the unwary. Is there some hidden danger to Sir Henry? When Dr. Watson walks around the countryside he is careful to carry his revolver. [They still had the right to keep and bear arms.] At the end the villain is unmasked and suffers poetic justice from his missteps. The ending talks about the police but this extra expense is not filmed.

After viewing this story I wondered if this was Doyles subtle attack on a hereditary aristocracy? The faults of the Baskervilles seems like some genetic disease that runs in that family. People became aristocrats by conquering and plundering the wealth of others. Doesnt this still go on today? Was that heart disease a genetic defect or acquired from loose living, like alcoholism?",1206403200,,2365,4.791666666666667
1623285,3,B00005LQ20,"Matt Frewer, a Canadian actor who brings an incredible sparkle to anything he touches (Max Headroom, Doctor Doctor [USA TV series], ""Trashcan Man"" in Stephen King's The Stand), has trouble rising above a terrible script. I will confess a prejudice to the Jeremy Brett performances as Holmes, primarily because the script writers injected their scripts with huge chunks of dialog taken directly from Conan Doyle's tales. Half, if not more, of the character of Sherlock Holmes stems from his dialog; this production uses almost none of it, and it shows.

In the early part of the film, Frewer provides an interesting interpretation of the Holmesian mania when pursuing a line of deductive logic. Sadly, the words that he is spouting are unpolished, trite, nearly nonsensical. A bit later, beginning at the scene in Sir Henry Baskerville's hotel lobby, Frewer finds a way to make the dialog work for him rather than against him. Since Holmes is absent for much of the middle portion of the ""Hound"" tale, there is a great stretch where Frewer disappears entirely, so there's little chance for a good actor to redeem himself from a poor script.

Kenneth Welsh, best known to fans of the TV series Twin Peaks as the fiendish Windom Earle, suffers a similar fate at the beginning of the film. At first, Welsh's Watson seems foolish, cowed by Holmes' brilliance, much as Nigel Bruce was cowed by Basil Rathbone. This outmoded interpretation of Watson -- who is, after all, a former soldier, a doctor of high ability, and certainly neither coward nor fool -- does no justice to any film reproduction of any Holmes work, but particularly ""Hound"", where Watson features so prominently. Luckily, although the script continues to suffer badly throughout the production, Welsh's Watson does find scenes in which to redeem himself.

I confess my ignorance of the remainder of the cast's other credits, so I have nothing with which to compare other performances. Overall, they seem to struggle gamely along with the poor script (I apologize for that repetition; I feel it important to put the blame where it seems to belong). Although his character was modified (most of them were), Robin Wilcock provided a most interesting performance as Stapleton, who is (without providing a ""spoiler"") a critical character in the piece.

Overall, the show is interesting enough, having found the DVD as I did at a ""Big Lots"" store for a mere $4.00 (sorry, Amazon). It's not likely to become a gem of your collection.",1178841600,,2488,4.959232613908873
1623286,5,B00005LQ20,"After Rathbone, Cushing, Lee, and Brett who knew there was still something new and exciting to be brought to the character of Sherlock Holmes? I've collected and viewed many Holmes films, but I've never seen a Holmes like this one! I am not a Frewer fan as a rule, but I must admit his vibrant and unique performance as Holmes won me over and my small children love him. Matt Frewer is astounding. It has not been easy to find a Holmes that my entire family enjoys, but Matt Frewer is such a Holmes. My husband, in-laws, parents, and children all enjoy this movie. I've been trying to find a Holmes film to do that for years!",1078876800,,625,4.35042735042735
1623287,3,B00005LQ20,"Conan Doyle's famous story is again brought back for the Hallmark TV presentation, starring Matt Frewer as Holmes.  What a daring attempt when you know everyone would compare him with Basil Rathbone or Jemery Brett, and your fearful expectations would be justified in the end.  Well, but anyway they did, so why not look at it?
Not that Matt Frewer cannot look like Holmes.  The point is, he tries to show off many ill-judged performance that attempts to differentiate him from the predecessors, using theatrical gestures and unnecessary mugging.  In fact, his Holmes  sometimes looks like a clown, and the character's die-hard cynicism is rendered into a sort of superficial interpretations, like a contorted face.  When he must sneer, he just chuckles.
Other characters are so-so; Kenneth Welsh plays a decent Watson, which is a likeable, but quite a dull fellow.  The scenery of the moor is suitably chosen, to express the book's Gothic background against which the folklore-based legendary hound must appear.
But the hound ... oh dear, when the deadly hound finally appears, he (or she?) often looks like just a big black dog with a pair of painted eyeballs.  There is no menace that might have sent some of the characters to death, and the lack of the authentic presentation of the titular hound hardly helps the film to be credible.
The story is pretty intact but the final chapter, when the truth is finally revealed.  The change is done, and not in an effective way.  In fact, the first half is quite reasonable, showing all the elements of the original book -- sinister-looking locale, strange behaviors of the servants, and Watson isolated in the moor -- but suddenly they all vanish in the middle of the hurriedly done ending, which should have been re-written for the dramatic impact.
Better than the same company's ""The Sign of Four,"" ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" offers decent fun of watching our beloved sleuth again on the screen.  But to me, why this new one has to be made again remains the greatest mystery.",1078531200,,2029,4.869186046511628
1623288,1,B00005LQ20,"This lousy retelling of Arthur Conan Doyle's novel comes to us via Canadian TV and the people of Hallmark.  This is, arguably, the worst version of the famous story yet- the early 70s version with Stewart Granger also vies for this distinction- but Matt Frewer's Sherlock Holmes is undoubtedly the worst I've seen.  This no-talent show-off mistakes performance for acting.  He prances about emphasizing random words and making grand gestures.  The performance has so little merit that the arrogance and self-satisfaction on display clearly belong to the actor and not to Sherlock Holmes.
The script does not help.  Although it strives to make the dialogue and characters accessible to modern audiences, it does so at the cost of credibility.  Modern lines and silly interchanges about whether to call a character ""Henry"" or ""Sir Henry"" do not at all evoke the Victorian era.  The narrative and characters suffer as well.  Subplots begin (but never reach conclusion), Sir Henry is presented as a frontiersman (instead of the Canadian gentleman of the book), and the escaped convict proves to be harmless (he has the brain of a child).  Believe me, not one of these changes improves upon the original.
And don't forget the budget limitations and lame slow motions sequences and bad cutting and...
The only person to emerge unscathed is Kenneth Welsch, who does a fine job as Dr. Watson.  Maybe some day he will appear in an acceptable Sherlock Holmes production opposite a worthy Sherlock Holmes.",1031788800,5,1494,5.061224489795919
1623289,4,B00005LQ20,"The Hallmark channel brings Holmes to life, played by Matt Frewer. While any true Sherlockian would point out the several changes in the story, I have no regrets to the purchase. Matt Frewer plays an excellent Holmes, if not too human for loyal fans of Doyle's stories, and Kenneth Welsh is an admirable Watson. There is certainly an element of comedy in the movie with the expected suspense. The complaints about the film would certainly be the shortened role of Holmes, and the scene with the carriage driver that first demonstrated the cunning of Holmes's rival. These differences, however, certainly do not take away any drastic effect to the purpose of the movie and it is a wonderful film for anyone interested in Holmes.",1013212800,4,727,4.870967741935484
1623290,4,B00005LQ20,"I would have to say that I am one of the few people who does not find Jeremy Brett of the Granada series THE definitive Holmes.  So I am always on the lookout for someone who COULD be the perfect Holmes.  Is Matt Frewer the answer?  Well, I don't think he's any better or worse than the others I've seen.  I don't think there will EVER be a definitive Holmes.
The problem most people seem to have is that they are VERY protective of the Holmes character and have a very specific preconceived notion of what he should look, sound and act like.  Because Frewer seems to make a more emoting Holmes, many think it is scandalous.  I don't find that true.
This adaptation is just that--it's BASED on the original story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. I can see why certain changes in character and plot are made... so they are more accessible to today's audience, which has a tendency to enjoy MTV-style quick editing, action scenes and very little engaging dialogue.
I have seen four different adaptations of THe Hound of the Baskervilles, and no one has gotten it completely right.  This, however, is a very competent attempt to do so, and if you don't take Holmes TOO seriously and reverently, you should enjoy this.",1007769600,7,1208,4.539170506912442
1623291,1,B00005LQ20,"Matt Frewer as Holmes?  I thought it a bit hard to believe when I first heard about this project, and after seeing him in the role, I am convinced that he is the worst Holmes of all time.
It is almost painful to see his portrayal--an accent that fluctuates all over the map, prone to odd gestures and movements, and wearing some outlandish clothing.  It's enough to make one squirm, and this viewer certainly did.
His treatment of Watson is terrible.  Kenneth Welsh tries valiantly to bring some life into this production, and his portrayal of Watson is good, but it's just not enough to save the film.
The production values are not the best--it was filmed in and around Montreal, and it shows.  Montreal does not look like Dartmoor, even after building the sets.  The ""Hound"" is a German Shepherd, and not very frightening-looking at that.
In all, a real disappointment.  If you want a great version of the ""Hound,"" the best to date is the 1939 Rathbone/Bruce, made by Fox.",1004227200,4,974,4.633720930232558
1623292,4,B00005LQ20,"For over three hundred years, a demon hound has been stalking and killing the heirs of Sir Hugo Baskerville. Roaming the family estate set in the desolate and lonely moors of England, the massive black dog with its red glowing eyes is a supernatural curse believed to be unstoppable. But when presented before the world's most famed consulting detective, the case proves more than supernatural... it proves sinister at the hands of a human adversary and a daring race against time and beast that ends in a horrifying climax that Doyle himself would be pleased with.
Stir in an eerie setting of lonely moors and creaking corridors, as well as an escaped convict that roams the heath by night, and you have a chilling Hallmark presentation that brings Doyle's most world-renowned work to the silver screen once again. And although Holmes plays only a slight role in this epic adventure, his presence is always somehow noted through the constant correspondence of Dr. Watson. But this time Watson is on his own... can he separate truth from lies in time to save the impressionable young Sir Henry's life? Or will this ghostly devil-dog rule the night?
The film stays close to the book in some respect (some of the lines are directly from the original manuscript), but it tends to wander a bit toward the end for dramatic purposes. It also moves rather slowly in the first half hour, but builds up later toward the climax. Despite its flaws, this adaptation is a fine one with an excellent cast and haunting soundtrack. I generally have a high opinion of most Hallmark presentations but a low one of Sherlock Holmes adaptations and I went into it with mixed feelings when it premiered, but I was pleasantly surprised. Dr. Watson, I was much impressed with. Instead of being portrayed as the bumbling idiot as with most other adaptations (most notably the originals starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce) this Watson does credit to the series... he's a witty, thoughtful man who is well-believed to have been a doctor at one time, and a darn good one at that. Holmes is a somewhat more comical portrayal than is normal, but it makes him extremely likable in that Matt Frewer does play him with an element of prideful arrogance (in keeping with the books). My mother, who is a strict non-Sherlockian, even admitted to liking him in the end.
It might not have the overall sense of doom as the Basil Rathbone version, or the ripping good climax of the Ian Richardson early eighties presentation, but it stands well upon its own two feet and is great fun for the entire family... considering, of course, that the children are not very young.",997315200,3,2634,4.765864332603939
7944381,4,B00005LQ20,"The Hound of the Baskervilles,"" made in 1959, is a production of Hammer Studios, the company best known for reviving classic movie monsters in a series of period horror films. This adaptation of one of Sir Arthur Conan Doyles most famous stories stars Peter Cushing as Sherlock Holmes and Andre Morell as Dr. Watson.

A terrifying hound lurks among the mist-shrouded cliffs of Englands moors, killing off the heirs of Baskerville Hall. Holmes is called in to investigate the murders before the hound can sink its fangs into the newest lord of the manor, Sir Henry Baskerville (Christopher Lee). Holmes and Watson encounter a number of colorful locals as Holmes demonstrates his incredible knack of coming to conclusions through keen observation and examination of motives. These scenes  as in most Homes adaptations  are the best and show the detectives elementary method of deduction.

Cushing is a very good Homes. He captures the self-assurance, intelligence, mannerisms and authority of the detective. Once he enters a scene, he commands the screen. He also is similar in appearance to the original Strand magazine illustrations with his deerstalker hat, cape and Meershaum pipe. His Holmes also displays a dry sense of humor, which lightens the mood a bit in this murder mystery. Its great to see Cushing team up with Lee, his frequent co-star in many Hammer horror films.

The film employs many of Hammers signature touches, such as rich production design, period costumes, and an atmosphere of foreboding, which enhance overall production values while adhering to the basics of the story. Cushing provides an above-average portrayal of Holmes and director Terence Fisher (The Curse of Frankenstein, Horror of Dracula) takes pains both to be respectful to Doyles tale as well as infusing the movie with Hammers distinctive look.

Bonus materials on the widescreen DVD include a featurette with Christopher Lee and the original theatrical trailer.",1497398400,,1952,5.240384615384615
