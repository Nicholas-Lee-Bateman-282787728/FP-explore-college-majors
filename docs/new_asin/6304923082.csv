949980,2,6304923082,"Although the goofiness and horrible storyline of ""Gargoyles"" makes any thespian cringe in terror, the movie itself has spawned many a loyal watcher (at least, two that I know of -- my father and me -- but  there are probably more...) I recommend this movie if you're an MST3K fan  -- or if you're sick and tired of the ""Platoons"" and  ""Titanics"" of this world.  It'll take your mind off the  seriousness of real life, if only for a couple of hours. Popcorn, cocoa,  and laughter are required.",911779200,3,492,4.534090909090909

950079,5,6304923082,"This movie, which was a TV movie, is one of the reasons I LOVE the 1970's! This is nothing but pure cheesy fun. I was afraid this movie wouldn't hold up to what I recall from my childhood. I was wrong, it held up and I had the best time watching it for the first time in over 40 years. It should be noted that Scott Glenn (of Silence Of The Lambs fame) also has a supporting role in this movie. My advice is to order this movie NOW! Have as many friends as possible over, pop some popcorn and have a blast!",1479945600,2,506,3.9223300970873787

950134,3,6304923082,"When I was about seven years old, I happened to see the movie GARGOYLES late one Saturday morning during the creature feature timeslot of a local tv station. GARGOYLES was a made-for-tv movie that first aired in 1972. I don't remember too much from seeing the movie as a boy except I found it incredibly frightening and for days later I had nightmares about gargoyles and was afraid for years after of any gargoyle statues I would see.  Recently I was able to get my hands on a copy of GARGOYLES on DVD and watched it with my younger brother (who had never seen the movie).

The movie revolves around Dr. Mercer Boley (Cornell Wilde), an anthropologist who specializes in demonology and the occult, and his daughter Diana (Jennifer Salt) who is a reporter. Dr. Boley greets Diana as she arrives on a small play and they drive off into the Nevada desert to meet with a man named Willie, who claims to have an artifact that he believes Dr. Boley will find interesting. It turns out Willie has a skeleton that appears to be from a winged reptile that could walk upright. Dr. Boley is convinced its a fake, but Willie is adamant its from a real creature rumored to have once lived in those parts. Boley interviews and records Willie as he tells his tale. However, soon the shack is attacked from the outside. The shack catches fire, Willie is killed by a falling timber, and Boley and Diana barely escape. While driving away they are attacked by a strange creature and things just get more weird and scary from there.

Watching GARGOYLES again as an adult was a much different experience than seeing it when I was a child. There are some moments in the film that were still suspenseful, for instance when Boley and his Diana first discover the gargoyles searching through their hotel room. However, compared to the standards of standards of suspense and terror that we now have, GARGOYLES is really, really tame, so much so that its almost comical at times. Some of the costumes are actually really, really silly looking now, particularly the gargoyles that have scales, feathers, and fur. Also, the slow-motion effect that made the gargoyles seem so much more frightening when I first saw the movie doesnt have the same effect now. In fact, I found it to be kind of distracting.

Although there are elements of GARGOYLES that don't stand up like they once did, the movie is not terrible.  However, its not a great movie either. The plot is kind of unoriginal, some of the dialogue is awful, and none of the characters are really developed.  Overall, GARGOYLES is an entertaining movie with a few suspenseful moments, but this is clearly from a different era and doesnt quite stand up to the test of time.",1476748800,,2701,4.640167364016737

The best scene is where the top gargoyle gets turned on by Jennifer Salt. See, gargoyles aren't stupid just evil. Side note, I noticed that Cornel Wilde was a lot skinnier with his shirt off than with it on. That had to be the best special effect in the movie.",1454284800,,398,4.25
950248,5,6304923082,Awesome movie and special effects were great for that time period--I would love to see a remake of this movie with the new technology we have now.  I hope they do make a new one.  I think everyone is so starved for science fiction --that is why the x files is back. The really good syfy shows are canceled  after one to two years on the air and I get really frustrated. Helix on the syfy channel is one that is an exceptional show and it was canceled after 2 years huge disappointment !!  Gargoyles is a great movie !!,1454198400,,518,4.15

950362,4,6304923082,"I had an old videotape of this movie that I copied from TV about 30 years ago. There was a break in the broadcast right at the point where the gargoyle(s) were breaking into Desert Willie's shed. We watched that movie as a family countless times over the years. The kids are grown now; we have four grandkids; and when this movie became available on DVD I had to buy it. Leonard Maltin (of movie review fame) credited this film with ""faultless use of locations."" Bernie Casey's head makeup is wonderful. The gargoyles are obviously wearing hair suits. Cornel Wilde is wonderful; Jennifer Salt is as cute as can be. Look for an appearance by a young Scott Glenn. Oddly, seeing the entire shed break-in is less frightening than the cut version from the old tape. Still a good movie -- not the least because of the memories.",1437868800,,821,4.554054054054054
950363,5,6304923082,"Okay, yes, this flick is dated. But I still remember seeing this on TV back in the 1970's and was quite fascinated with it back then. So, when I saw it was available on DVD, I picked it up at amazon. com. Yes it is dated but it still has that certain 'flavor' to it. It still has some shock value and at the time it was produced and released, it was considered quite an achievement (in movie make-up and special effects).

The beginning is very creepy.  They go to visit an old desert rat who runs a slapdash museum full of oddities.  The only thing of true interest is a strange skeleton that happens to be a gargoyle.  The living gargoyles attack and the professor and his daughter start being stalked by the creatures, who want their existence to remain a secret.  The head gargoyle, played by Bernie Casey, is truly impressive.  The gargoyle makeup is, for the times, very good.  No two gargoyles look alike.

950705,5,6304923082,"I first saw this when it premiered on TV. I was 13 and loved scary movies. (Still do.) The scene that had me racing out of the living room with my hands over my eyes was when the anthropologist and his adult daughter are in the shed, looking at the gargoyle skeleton. There is a noise and suddenly the shed is being attacked. I'm pretty sure it then went into a commercial break and my mom coaxed me back into the living room. Watched the rest of the movie scrunched in a ball behind my mom, and we agreed it was a winner. Only saw it once again after that--a friend had taped it off of the TV and it was blurry and jumpy. I tossed it, but never forgot the sound of the gargoyles' flapping wings and that creepy voice of the alpha gargoyle. And the ending is so satisfying! And a very young Scott Glenn was yummy!

So now at the age of 55, I finally have my own copy and trust me, on Halloween night I am going to sit in front of the TV and scare myself silly, again.",1413763200,,967,4.010362694300518

950797,5,6304923082,"Great movie! And it was made for TV back in the early 70s! So with their schedule and budget, I think it's a great movie. You can imagine how much more frightening it would be were it to be produced today. It's actually very effective in several scenes, very well directed from a decent script. An original story! How often can you say that about a movie? The actress who plays the scientist's daughter wears a very early-70s halter top which did not make an impression on me when I was a kid, but which definitely caught my eye as a grown man. Cornel Wilde carries the movie. I want to avoid spoilers, so I'll leave it with the beginning, when the scientist and his daughter bump down a dusty desert road to find a decrepit compound run by Willie, a desert rat, who, eventually, reveals a man-sized skeleton he has in a separate building from his creepy ""desert museum"" roadside attraction, which has bones for wings and horns on its skull. The scientist laughs at Willie, who has broken out in a sweat as he revealed the skeleton... by this time night has fallen. As the scientist is laughing at Willie, you hear what sounds like the brush of enormous wings on the roof of the shed they're in... and away it goes! GOOD MOVIE!!! I wonder what the story is behind this movie, why they didn't go for an independent movie release instead of a made-for-TV movie?

950874,5,6304923082,"Released to TV in 1972, ""Gargoyles"" is just simply grand entertainment of the highest order. Yes, it's a Grade B cartoony TV flick, the precursor to notorious modern SyFy flicks, but imagination and legend are about good versus evil and the power of selfless courage against impossible odds. In other words, there's nothing more heroic, suspenseful and spooky than man against monster, and ""Gargoyles"" delivers the goods.

THE PLOT: A professor/writer and his daughter (Cornel Wilde & Jennifer Salt) come across a bunch of recently re-birthed gargoyles in the desert and mayhem ensues.

Highlights include: An excellent and mysterious beginning (the first 20 minutes or so where some desert rat shows the professor and his daughter a gargoyle skeleton in some dark shack out in the middle of nowhere; night comes down and the gargoyles attack), nice spooky atmosphere, haunting soundtrack, excellent gargoyle costumes for that era (and considering it was a TV movie), good cast, dirt bikers (led by a young Scott Glenn), chases, hellish cave sets, cool gargoyle voices, grisly gargoyle murders, etc. Hey, there's a reason for all these high ratings. The majority of the reviewers probably saw it when they were kids and were totally spooked-out.

Bottom Line: ""Gargoyles"" is proof that you don't need a big budget to make a great, engrossing, creepy, adventurous flick.

The film doesn't overstay its welcome at 74 minutes and was shot in Carlsbad, NM, and Laredo, TX.

To some, by this point in time, it may seem a bit cheesy, I've seen this a few times since childhood, and it's always terrified me! I knew I had to one day buy it on DVD to add to my collection, and it's still creepy fun from beginning to end! It stars Cornel Wilde as an anthropologist who studies ancient legends and demonology. He's visited by his beautiful daughter, played by Jennifer Salt, out in the Southwest. One night, while checking out the remains of a bizarre winged creature, they, along with a strange old man who shows them the remains in his shack, are attacked by members of the creature's race, Gargoyles. The old man dies, and soon this incident is just the beginning of a wild and dangerous adventure into all out terror as the anthropologist, his daughter, the local police, as well as some dirt bikers come face to face with centuries old demonic monsters who are bent on world domination (and wiping out all humanity in the process). Featuring Bernie Casey in a chilling performance as the Gargoyle leader, and terrifying make-up effects by the late Stan Winston (Terminator, Aliens, Predator), this is a fun and atmospheric movie that'll give you goosebumps!!",1394236800,,1257,4.718181818181818
950881,3,6304923082,"This is a classic horror movie that really creeped me out and left an indelible impression on me.  But when you watch it today, it has so many flaws that it is only, at best, amusing and even comedic.  The gargoyles can barely move in their flappy-skinned suits.  The face masks do not move.  The voice changer used by the main gargoyle can be purchased for 15 bucks on Amazon today.  Very cheap.  Very funny.

The actors don't do very well.  Very tame expressions and unemotional deliveries, even when their characters are encountering gargoyles for the first time.  The worst is when a supposedly traumatic encounter happens: afterward the actors are calm, as if it's no big deal.  Happens often enough.  LOL.

The plot is often silly.  Not well-thought-out.  A guy burns to death and the actors are calm--they go to a hotel to get a good night's rest.  A female gargoyle gets jealous and helps the humans.  These ancient creatures of such mythological renown cannot read, live in caves, and yet promise to take over the world.

They cannot even navigate their own cave system without trying not to fall in their clunky skins.  At one point in the movie, during a chase in the caves, it sounds like one of the gargoyles farts.

How this was scary once is beyond me.  I was a child when it enthralled me.  In all honesty, this is a movie that is worth remaking with today's effects and better writers.

It's worth watching for nostalgia's sake, but NEVER BUY IT.  You can catch it for FREE on a popular video site that everybody uses.  Even YOU can post a video on this site.

Hope this helps.  I have to go search for gargoyles now.",1393286400,2,1634,4.510273972602739

But before much more can be learned, the place is ripped apart and the old man lies dead & burned in the ruins. The prof & his young daughter find themselves on the run from (and knee-deep in) the reptilian demons, who've recently begun hatching as their 600 lifecycle begins anew. Their fiendish goal? The same one all evil beings have: conquer the world, of course!

THOUGHTS: I fondly recall watching this when it debuted on TV back in 1972. In those days it seems there was always something scary being made for TV: The Night Stalker, The Norliss Tapes, Scream of The Wolf, Trilogy of Terror, Don't Be Afraid of The Dark, etc. Nowadays nothing gets made for TV unless it's socially significant or whatnot. Blah! Whatever happened to just being entertained for entertainment's sake? GARGOYLES has a pretty spiffy acting cast. Cornel Wilde & Jennifer Salt are the gruff professor & his headstrong daughter. Prolific character actor Bernie Casey, (perhaps best-remembered as U.N. Jefferson, president of the Tri-Lambda fraternity from ""Revenge of The Nerds""!), is quite excellent, (though unrecognizable buried under an early Stan Winston make-up job), as the cruel & crafty leader of the gargoyle gang. And check out Scott Glenn as a renegade badboy who teams up with the local authorities to help battle the legions of lizard men. Boy was he young here! This movie was scary fun and at the tender age of six I was terrified. GARGOYLES still packs a few scares, but I watch it more for the nostalgia factor now. Kids these days aren't ""scared"" unless someone's head's being split in two with a hatchet or bodies are being blown up, spurting fountains of blood or whatnot. *SIGH* Who needs all that excessive in-your-face violence & gore when all you really need is the ability to suspend your disbelief and a vivid imagination!?

THE DVD: Audio & video quality of this particular home release is pretty good, actually. Much better than some of the earlier editions I've owned. Colors are solid, picture is clear, focus is sharp. Audio is clean & strong. BOTTOM LINE: After more than 40 years the made-for-TV spooktacular fright flick GARGOYLES is still a fun way to spend a rainy Saturday afternoon, or a good excuse to stay up late with a bowl of popcorn and veg on the couch. 4 STARS",1387584000,2,2507,4.800925925925926

Not that I'm complaining as this was made in the early 70's.

There is not any over the top explosions, no UFO's, no one comes back from the dead, or nothing beyond reality.

951289,5,6304923082,"For a long time I had heard about the movie Gargoyles but I was never able to see it because no one ever had it on. Then one day, I was doing a google search for it and saw that it was on DVD and decided to take a chance. Man am I glad I did. Gargoyles came out of that great era of television when broadcast networks had weekly movies and mini-series in which the people involved actually cared about their work, no matter what. In the movie, we have a professor of folklore played by the great but sadly late and mostly forgotten Cornel Wilde who is traveling in the southwest with his daugther to hear a story from what appears to be a crazy old man. However, as the old man is telling his story, the building they are in is attacked by horrific monsters. These are the Gargoyles, the evil ones. Now this summary may sound like any other monster movie you've ever seen. But what really makes this movie stand above so many others is the makeup. The makeup in this movie is so real looking that if I was walking down a dark alley and someone jumped out at me with this makeup on, I would probably die of fright. For a movie made in 1972 for television, that is nothing short of amazing. Although, if you look at the credits for this movie, I guess it should come as no suprise since the amazing Stan Winston was involved. Bottom line, if you love good monster movies, don't miss this movie. You would only be robbing yourself.",1346025600,,1428,4.2344322344322345
951290,5,6304923082,"I did not buy this DVD right when it came out. Having made the switch to Blu-ray, I avoided most DVD releases for a while. However, I recently decided to take a chance and purchase some movies that I doubted would make it to Blu-ray. This was one of those titles. I am so glad I did, as I cannot express how impressed I am with this transfer. It is the best looking catalogue DVD I have seen. Sure, there are some soft moments, but many scenes, especially daylight ones, could convince me that I was watching a Blu-ray if I didn't already know I was watching DVD. I'm completely satisfied with this release and actually do think there's no need for this title to be upgraded to any other format. There are reasons this picture looks so good; it's a short movie (74 min) with only two audio tracks (one of those being the sole special feature), so it has a lot of breathing room. For much of the time the bit rate hovers around 8-9 mbps, which is pretty impressive for a DVD.

As for the movie, I have fond memories of it. I watched it every time it was featured on MONSTERVISION (usually after BLOOD BEACH, which needs an official disc release too) and it left a lifelong impression on me. These days, its flaws are a bit more obvious and the monsters don't seem very monstrous (kidnapping people so they can learn from them and be read to >_>), but it will always remain special due to the nostalgia factor. It's certainly better than most current Hollywood flicks and the dull computer generated crap on SyFy that actually makes an attempt to be bad (*coughs* SHARKTOPUS *coughs*).",1345766400,2,1583,4.439862542955327

951293,3,6304923082,"The DVD release of this 70's made for tv movie is awesome. The transfer is really good and the extras are great as well. But everyone seems to be reviewing this movie like it's a lost masterpiece and it just isn't. The acting is subpar and maybe exactly what you'd expect from a TV Movie and the special effects by Stan Winston are really good, but they're still laughable in certain scenes. I won't go into detail as to not give away anything (spoilers) but there is a sequence which features the Gargoyles in slow motion that seems to last a lifetime. The horrible ""phase"" effect on the speaking Gargoyle made me giggle everytime. And this movie was never ""scary"" in anyway, it just wasn't!

  I think a lot of the people that are reviewing this movie viewed this movie as a child and I can see how this type of movie could be scary for a young child and the nastalgia it can make one feel but it's far from being scary for and adult. I'm still glad I saw this movie because it was always talked about by lovers of horror movies and for seeing some ""early"" Stan Winston special effects but it's not a movie I will be watching again anytime soon.

951367,4,6304923082,"I remember watching this on TV when I was a teenager, and being totally creeped out by the early scene where ""something"" attacks the trio in the shed, starting with clambering noisily on the roof. That scene has stayed with me since 1972, and I had to buy this DVD to see how ""Gargoyles"" held up after 39 years.

I'm happy to say that it held up pretty well. This was television land in the 70's, so you know there's no blood or gore. The horror comes from tension and suspense.  You find out what the menace is after a short while, but there's other creepy moments. Like when the head gargoyle kidnaps a girl and has her read out loud an ancient text where a woman describes being taken by a gargoyle for his pleasure. Euwwww! Given that it's TV, the description is PG and subtle, but suspend your disbelief and it makes you squirm.

The movie was worth it just to see a very young and good looking Scott Glen - who plays a biker dude, of all things!

""Gargoyles"" won an Emmy for Outstanding Achievement in Makeup for the team of Del Armstrong, Ellis Burman Jr, and Stan Winston.  Stan Winston, who passed away in 2008, went on to found Stan Winston Studio, which worked on make-up and costumes we all recognize. His first Oscar was for ""Aliens"" in 1986. He picked up another two Oscars for ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" (1992) and ""Jurrasic Park"" (1993).

The weak point in the gargoyle masks/make-up is that the cheeks and forehead don't move when speaking. But keeping in mind it was a low-budget TV movie in the 70's, you realize they really were good. The scene where a line of gargoyles is going through the brush at night, seen from a distance, is memorable - they look awesome.

Overall, I thought the cinematography was even better than I remembered.

""Gargoyles"" is 74 minutes long. The only special feature is an option for Audio Commentary by director Bill L. Norton. (English subtitles are also available.)

Recommended for light horror and nostalgia! Keep in mind the era in which it was produced, and you'll enjoy it.

951370,4,6304923082,"In 1972, the sixties were over, the flower child days having been killed off by the Rolling Stones at Altamont, or by the Manson Family at LA, or by the National Guard at Kent State. America was tired, scared, and hung-over and the hippies were devolving.... either into apolitical burn-outs, or, worse-yet, Jesus-freaks.

The Jesus-Christ-Superstar fad eventually inspired a more Bible-oriented type of horror movie. Also, as a traumatized America turned more and more toward to the Christian Bible, more and more people indulged in Apolcolyptic thinking...the Book of Revelations being filled with lurid and horrifying images, and with ambiguous prophecies such as would allow a reader from any time or place to believe that he was truly living in the End of Days.

The clever writer of this film combined a bit of Biblical mythology, plus Miltonic concepts, and medieval demonology to create a set of very original and effective monsters. The opening of this film has Vic Perrin (greatest scifi/horror voice ever!) narrate this mix of mythology, adding a new bit about every 500 years or so the gargoyles returning to plague the human race. The spooky Perrin intro is played over a montage of medieval gargoyles from Gothic Cathedrals, plus demonic images by Hieronymus Bosch and Peter Bruegel.

A year after this film, the big budget 'The Exorcist' was released, which lead to 'The Omen' and sequels, 'Carrie,' and 'Amityville Horror'...all horror films with strong religio-Biblical elements and themes. Eventually, this sub-genre morphed into the execrable 'Left Behind' books and videos. But this film beat them all to the punch.

Considering the time, budget and technological constraints, this is actually a finely made and very original little horror film. The cast is up to the task, and there are no bad performances...weak moments in the script are dealt with quickly, so the audience doesn't get much time to notice them.

Cornell Wilde, whose career was rapidly fading in his rear-view mirror, does a good job here and the director wisely had the lovely Jennifer Salt wearing halter tops throughout the film. Ahhh, but I am nostalgic for the days when women still had natural bodies and halter tops were in fashion! The Gargoyle Supreme Commander make-up for Bernie Casey is excellent, and Vic Perrin's voice-over is great. The supporting gargoyles are all very good as well.

In classic 1970's style, the gargoyles are battled by youth riding dirt bikes and grown-ups riding Off-Road Vehicle's. In true American fashion, fossil fuels are the main weapon to stave off the apocalypse. We now know, with the benefit of hindsight, that a real apocalypse, either ecological, economic, or a combination, is the most likely result of our faith in fossil fuels. But that's the upside of the Biblical Apocalypse...it frees you from worrying about real problems.

This DVD is of good quality but the only 'special feature' is a director's commentary, which, like most, I didn't have the patience to sit through.",1318550400,6,3016,5.117886178861789

951372,3,6304923082,"While cruising through the many B horror choices we stumbled on a 70's flick recently release on DVD. When we say the title we just had to laugh. Gargoyles was something the Dutch Master had always fancied, and we know he would have had the rubber band ball under the door for this one. So in a backhanded way we just had to watch from a bizarre source of inspiration. Now that doesn't mean we're going to thumb tack a bunch of sealed action figures to our walls, but we will give Gargoyles a shot. Outside of the Dutch factor this movies cover was so intensely B. Not to mention it's from the 70's which is always a selling point for horribly cheap creature effects. Let us tell you it did not disappoint in the laughable creature action. Seriously these things were nothing more then plastic masks in which the mouth couldn't even move. It was just wonderful in every sense.

The movie starts out in typical 70's fashion with the porn style music in full effect. Once the intro wraps up we're introduced a man whose an anthropology professor. He's going on a little road trip with his daughter to take a look at some supposed ""odd creature"" remains. This professor is a total creature freak and collects little oddities. As they trek out into the middle of the desert you can see they're being followed by something. Yup you guessed it, Gargoyles. Once they arrive at their destination they're met by a grizzly old fellow that kind of looks like Chuck (John Deer Chuck) only way cooler. The old coot winds up having a full gargoyle skeleton and brings the wrath of his fellow buddies upon them. From here on out the chaos ensues and the professor and his daughter must fight against the hilarious looking gargoyles.

This is surely not a film for everybody, especially those seeking anything remotely suspenseful or scary. However it does have a element of charm thanks to it's super low budget and hilarious creature combination platter. It's about the equivalent of Santa eating his chini with popcorn on top, chased down with a PBR, while smoking an anisette cigar in his Brett jersey and underwear. It's where you can't stop laughing yet can't look away at the mess you've been exposed to. Hopefully you can see the correlation. Gargoyles is actually more like a family film then an actual horror. It was made for tv in the 70's, so you should know exactly what to expect. The creatures are fantastic for the 70's and will have you cracking up the whole way through. The only reason for three stars was the extent of the dialogue. Just lead to too much boredom in between creature attacks. Not a film we strongly suggest but certainly good for 1 viewing.",1316908800,,2660,4.597894736842106

Back then every network use to show one. Some were made for
tv movies and most of them were very good some even classics
and better than what is being made today! I don't know if this
was ever released on the big screen but it should've been. It
stars Cornell Wilde who was probably at the end of his acting
days. He still puts on a great performance. The story starts
with him and his daughter traveling in the desert looking
for a old man who has something to show him. It's a skeleton
of one of the gargoyles and then all hell breaks loose when
the gargoyles come to get the bones so nobody discovers their
nest in the mountains so they can eventually take over the world.
The gargoyles look awesome especially for the time made kinda of
like original planet of the apes! Very believable. As a kid this
movie scared me to death but I loved it. I have a vhs copy I got
years ago so I can say about the dvd. But if this was released
today I think kids would love it! I'd love to see on big screen.

951475,2,6304923082,"There are quite a few positive reviews for this movie and I cannot figure out why. To me this was a real lame outing. It failed on nearly every level it could fail on.

Here's the scoop. Cornel Wilde researches ancient writings dealing with evil and demonology. He's on his way to Mexico with his daughter (played by Jennifer Salt) to do some work and begin a new book. They take a detour to some bust-out road side attraction whose owner says he has something of interest. It turns out to be an odd, vaguely humanoid skeleton. As soon as said skeleton is unveiled the bad, smelly stuff hits the fan in the form of real live Gargoyles.

The basic story line is actually not bad at all but it's simply mishandled. The warning is that they come out at night, but one of the worst attacks takes place in broad daylight. One of the lead Gargoyles tells the daughter that humans have nothing to fear from them, then he turns around and says they are going to wipe out the entire human race. Stupid stuff like that happens throughout. It IS a made for TV movie with a rather small budget. It's paced for commercial breaks which is something that always bothers me. The Gargoyle costumes (early Rick Baker) are pretty horrendous. They are of the rubber suit variety and look cheezy. Even the designs themselves aren't all that good. It isn't directed all that well either. Too many of the shots are framed poorly and the ""action"" scenes are clumsy. Then there is the daughter. Jennifer Salt is more than a bit fetching and they played that card too strongly. She is supposed to be accompanying her father in the field. So what's with fancy hairdo, high-heeled platform shoes, designer jeans and assorted halter tops? Looked nice but way out of place. You do get to see a pre-fame Scott Glenn though. He does a decent job and it's easy to see he was headed for better things.

This might have been fond memories for those who might have seen it at a young age, but, for my money, it didn't withstand the test of time.",1314230400,2,2009,4.453804347826087

As an aside, I lived on the plains at the time this premiered. Just say'n, it's easy to let your imagination run wild after dark, especially if you live in a seemingly empty place where primitive fear can co-mingle with fantasy. I didn't find it as scary as the first time around, maybe because now I find the baby Gargoyles are more cute than frightening - but the Main Dude, yeah, he's  really convincing as the Devil himself. The woman who plays the drunk'n motel owner is a show stealer and the make up artistry is great. All in all a four star gem of fun, funk, and chill factor.

Sadly, there isn't that much commentary and what there is deals with matters obvious to anyone who can freeze-frame the credits and check the IMDB.  The only thing in the commentary of note was that Bill Norton is 67 but sounds about 27.

951561,4,6304923082,"I saw ""Gargoyles"" for the first and only time when it originally aired on television in 1972. That was long before the days of personal video recorders, of course. Apparently it never aired again, and it was not available in any form until this Hen's Tooth edition appeared in May 2011. Even though I hadn't thought about the show at all in the intervening years, I snapped this DVD up as soon as it became available, just because I remembered having seen it in my youth. It's not that I recalled the story in any specific detail. Rather, what stuck in my mind was that it conveyed a vague sense of menace from mysterious reptilian creatures, plus the fact that it took place in the rugged desert of the Southwestern U.S. As it turns out, it was filmed in and around Carlsbad, New Mexico, quite near my current home.

Having just watched it for the first time in almost 40 years, I have to say it's not as good as I hoped, but not as bad as it could have been. The heavily religious-toned voiceover at the beginning initially put me off, but fortunately that was the only overt religious reference in the entire show. The story is reasonably logical and straightforward, once you buy into the premise that greenish, scaly, hostile, winged humanoid creatures appear on Earth every 400 or 500 years or so to wage war on humanity. The acting is generally adequate but unspectacular. The pacing is mostly quite good, but there are a couple of slow spots, especially after the action moves to the underground cavern (actually part of famed Carlsbad Caverns). The music score is suitably eerie, and serves the purpose very well of conveying, in part, that sense of menace that I remembered. The special effects are what really sets ""Gargoyles"" apart from standard 1970s made-for-TV-movie fare. The creatures are very well done, given that the limitations of the day meant they had to be actors dressed up in rubber suits. All of them are different, which took a lot more effort in the makeup department than if a bunch of gargoyle suits had simply been cast from a single mold.

Aficionados who had been waiting for ""Gargoyles"" to appear on DVD will surely be impressed with the video and audio quality of this release. The full-screen transfer is clear, crisp and sharp, with very good contrast and color (even though a lot of the story takes place in darkness). If you've never seen ""Gargoyles,"" you should still consider giving it a try. It's not really a ""classic"" in any sense of the word, but it is a pleasant way to while away 74 minutes--or 148 minutes, if you listen to the relatively sparse but reasonably informative audio commentary by Director Bill L. Norton. I consider it a very worthwhile addition to my DVD library.",1310169600,15,2726,4.665280665280665
951562,4,6304923082,"A made-for-TV flick that originally aired on CBS in November of 1972, GARGOYLES tells the story of an anthropology researcher (Cornel Wilde) who, with the assistance of his adult daughter (Jennifer Salt), travels to the Arizona desert to investigate an unusual skeleton discovered there. However, when the duo try to transport the bony remains away from the discovery site, they are pursued by a number of gargoyle-like creatures who want to reclaim the unearthed skeleton, and the scientist and his daughter soon find themselves at the locus of an age-old battle between mankind and an evil race of garrulous reptilians.

Yes, it's cheesy.  But for many horror fans who grew up in the 1970s, it's one of those guilty pleasures that, in spite of any intrinsic sense of good taste, will always have a special place in their nostalgic little hearts--right there next to Wacky Packages stickers and CRACKED magazine.  And to be honest, it's really not all that bad, especially when compared to a lot of the other tripe spewed by the one-eyed monster during the ""ME"" decade.

At times GARGOYLES can be really atmospheric, especially during the night scenes in which the titular creatures attempt to reclaim the bones of their dead, but at other times it is blatantly ridiculous.  The first half of the film actually plays better than the second, as the viewer is then offered only brief glimpses of the nightmarish reptilians as they swoop down on moving autos or attack folk in secluded buildings.  The ""magic"" quickly dissipates, however, when the creatures finally appear in full view and the audience can easily see the Gargoyles for what they really are--a group of actors and stuntmen in unconvincing rubber suits. The one exception to this rule is the make-up job on the Gargoyle king, played by former professional football player Bernie Casey.  This character looks like a greenish incarnation of Satan himself, and when combined with the eerie vibrato of his voice, he never fails to evoke plenty of gooseflesh.

In spite of the hokey premise of the plot and the rubber-suit monsters, GARGOYLES is definitely a must-see for serious horror fans.  There are some genuinely spooky moments, especially early on, and the film is also historically notable for being the first major professional gig for make-up FX master Stan Winston.  (Considering the masterful work he produced in the years following this film--everything from Cicely Tyson's ""aged"" skin in TV's THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MISS JANE PITTMAN to EDWARD SCISSORHANDS to several incarnations of the TERMINATOR--it's not unreasonable to assume that he was responsible for the outstanding make-up of the Gargoyle king and NOT the rubber suits.)

Like the earlier DVD release from VCI, this one is short on extras. However, the digital transfer was made from the complete, uncut version of the film that was previously screened only in Europe, and that means that even long-time fans of the show in North America may actually see a few bits they didn't see initially on CBS or during the film's numerous syndicated reruns.  Definitely worth picking up a copy.",1309046400,8,3115,5.050682261208577
951563,5,6304923082,"Love this movie ever since I first saw it on TV in 1972 and it scared me silly, I had nightmares for weeks (I had a bed not unlike the one used in that motel room scene with Cornel Wilde).  Needless to say, I don't sleep in beds like that anymore!
Haven't seen this movie in decades, so naturally I was pleased when I got this DVD: very good transfer (I would have accepted less).  Exactly how I remembered it, scene for scene.  True, it's not a masterpiece but it is sheer perfection when it comes to this type of movie.  Have I mentioned that I absolutely love this movie?

The old man unveils the mysterious skeleton to the Anthropologist and his daughter in the hopes of becoming famous. The Anthropologist has a different idea; he wants to take the skeleton back to the lab for testing. The Gargoyles have a more sinister plan, they want their skeleton back and nothing is going to stand in their way. Let the terror begin!

Since its first airing on television, this 1972 Cult Classic has been a hit with horror fans the world over and thanks to Hen's Tooth Video we can enjoy it once again on DVD. For any fan of this movie wondering what the picture and sound quality are like; wonder no more. The full screen video transfer from Hen's Tooth video is almost perfect. The picture is the best I've ever seen and the colors are sharp and vibrant. The sound is English mono 2.0 and it's the best I've ever heard this movie sound. The sound came across clean and crisp on my sound system. The disc packaging and disc artwork are well done and Hen's Tooth video should be commended for their efforts.

Very few low budget made for TV movies created almost 40 years ago have stood the test of time; Gargoyles is the exception. The acting is solid and the makeup, costumes and non CGI special effects are well done; this film won an Emmy for Outstanding Achievement in makeup and Gargoyles wasn't a Hollywood blockbuster. The makeup, costumes and eerie music make Gargoyles an instant classic!  For anyone who hasn't seen this film, Gargoyles is 74 minutes of pure entertainment and I'm glad I finally own it on DVD.

951565,4,6304923082,"GARGOYLES is one of those rare, early 1970s TV movies that still holds up well after nearly 40 years. Fast-moving at only 74 minutes in length, it combines an interesting premise with good performances, and one of the scariest monsters ever in the form of the lead gargoyle.  Along with the likes of BAD RONALD, CRAWLSPACE, and DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK, GARGOYLES is that rarest of television movies, one that could easily have been released to theaters.  Several elements of the film have stuck with me over the years--the interesting way the gargoyles speak, which sounds as though they are talking into a box fan--the gargoyles' slow motion movements--the New Mexico scenery--the creativity of the costumes and makeup (all of the gargoyles are different even though it would have been more cost effective to make them all look the same), and most notably the face of the lead gargoyle, embodied by Bernie Casey and voiced by Vic Perrin (the narrator from THE OUTER LIMITS). Oh, and let's not forget Grayson Hall as the drunken motel manager who rants about drunks, but has a glass of booze in her hand in almost every scene. I would love to see this film remade on a much bigger scale. Since DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK is getting the remake treatment, GARGOYLES should be next. It's that well done.",1305849600,10,1305,4.719298245614035

Don't miss YOUR chance to snatch this up because you may not get another one. The Video Transfer is really exceptional to the point of it being in HD quality even though it isn't. When I pre-ordered it I didn't expect the picture to be so clear because I had never heard of ""Hen's Tooth Video"" before and thought the transfer might be all grainy and blurred or pixelated...but no, It's about as good as a blu-ray. I even have some blu-ray videos where the transfers are worse than this DVD - so if it's quality you're worried about then you can take my word - It's a top notch video and worth the money.

If you're reading this reveiw and haven't seen it - then for the love of God you'd better see it! It's a great movie to watch alone or with your family.

While the make-up is cool, the real hair-raising special effect is the sound mixing. First, there's the cool use of the lead gargoyle's wings to alter his voice is eerie, but it's the sound that's played when the unseen creatures attack that has stayed with me for over 3 decades!",1305504000,45,500,4.606741573033708
951568,5,6304923082,"I saw this movie on television in the ""old days"".  You can still tell where the commercial breaks were.  As another reviewer said, ""There WAS life before CGI.""  It was a great scary movie and the Gargoyles were REAL people in Gargoyle suits!  (Imagine that!) Originally from 1972--74 minutes of scary movie fun.  Go pop your microwave popcorn, grab your Dos Equis (beer), and settle in for some fun.

The movie is preceded by verbiage about the devil being defeated by God and banished to Hell, as pictures of the devil, demons, and angels are shown.  The movie tells us the gargoyles were the devil's offspring and were to take over Earth as the devil's domain.  The Gargoyles would be reborn every 600 years until they succeed.  So far, man has wiped them out each time.  (So, it looks like it's Gargoyle time again.)

The movie begins as veteran actor Cornel Wilde/Professor Mercer Boley (a popular actor in his time, who is no longer with us) waits for his daughter Diana Boley/Jennifer Salt at the local airport.  Diana lives with her mom, and mom has remarried.  The Professor is a best-seller author and a science Professor at a University.  He is big into demonology (big surprise-lol) and has an extensive demon figure collection.  The Professor invited his daughter to travel to Mexico with him.  On the way, he is stopping to see Willie.  Willie saw the Professor on a talk show and claims to have something of interest to show, and the Professor is beginning a new book about the last 5000 years.

Driving through the desert, they hear and see something strange, but it was quick.  They come upon Uncle Willie's Desert Museum, a bizarre desert store in need of repairs but unlikely to get them.  In a shack out back, Uncle Willie/Woody Chambliss bolts the door and shows Diana and the Professor a complete set of Gargoyle bones.  The Professor thinks this is just a collection of old bones that Willie pieced together, but Willie explains the area was named ""Devil's Crossing"" by the Indians and they have passed down stories of Gargoyles in the hills for hundreds of years.

As Diana starts the old cassette tape recorder, Willie begins to tell the story of the Nocatacachinkos (the Indian name for devils).  Suddenly, something begins to attack the shack, knocking over the lanterns and igniting the place.  Diana grabs the recorder and the Professor grabs the skull and they run for their lives, with Gargoyles in pursuit.  The Professor remembers from his research that the Gargoyles always return for their dead!  The excitement continues as Cornel Wilde and his daughter are chased by the Gargoyles through the desert.  Remember, it is Gargoyle time, again.  The eggs are getting ready to hatch, and this time, they plan to succeed!

The Gargoyles are human-sized lizards, with wings and long sharp nails.  They have no superior strength or qualities, other than the wings allow them to fly.  They can be shot or killed the same as a human.  Apparently the women get jealous, too.  Bernie Casey plays the main Gargoyle.  Excellent make up work, similar to the work done for ""Planet of the Apes"" and ""Enemy Mine"" movies.

Movie fans will also note a young Scott Glenn as part of a group of motorcycle riders, and a vintage Jeep. Ladies will love Diana's white top that does not get dirty while climbing around the rocks, too.  I want one of those!

This is a good scare for the price of a video flick and likely a movie you will remember often and watch over-and-over again.  Wonderfully done for its time and is said to be an ""Award-Winning Horror Classic"".",1305417600,7,3575,4.724919093851133

If you are a fan of 70's tv; it's a good bet you'll want this compelling drama for your collection.  Apparently this was a TV movie that was replayed quite a bit on CBS late night TV.

GARGOYLES is a treasured TV horror film, right up there w/ DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK, DARK NIGHT OF THE SCARECROW, CROWHAVEN FARM, THE NIGHT STALKER, and TRILOGY OF TERROR. For its time, the monster makeup (by the legendary Stan Winston) was incredible, especially for 1970's television! The story itself, is sort of like an extended episode of ROD SERLING'S NIGHT GALLERY. Dr. Mercer Boley (Cornel Wilde) and his daughter Diana (Jennifer Salt) must face the hideous, title creatures in a battle over a mysterious skeleton, discovered at a tourist-trap, roadside ""museum"". The Boley's go to the police, who blame it all on some bikers- led by Scott Glenn! Then, the beasts attack our heroes, right in their motel room! This all culminates in the revealing of the horned, winged leader (Bernie Casey) of the hellish horde. The eyes and voice of which used to make my flesh crawl! Of course, a million years later, and I'm no longer as easily scared as I was then. However, I do still watch the skies at night, especially when driving out in the middle of nowhere...

Only problem is that it's was going for like 72 dollars! Yeah right. It certainly is NOT worth that price. I ordered it on VHS just so I could watch the whole thing again. I enjoyed certain aspects of it, Like the beginning, when they talk about Lucifer,and ancient evils, that really sets a creepy mood. The scenes at the old coot's shed are good. The Gargoyles themselves range from genuinely Scary, to downright goofy looking. One scene when the leader Gar guy brings the human girl back to their caves, and his female Gargoyle mate acts jealous, he sort of caresses her then smacks her on her A$$. I burst out laughing, and all creepiness was long gone. I like movies from the seventies, with their sideburns, and period clothes,not to mention cops that wear cowboy hats are always fun!

951724,5,6304923082,"This film has remained in the recesses of My evocative contemplation since I first saw it some dark and dreary night upon a horror movie showcase, and has remained an occasional viewing pleasure.

Dr. Mercer Boley, an Anthropologist studying Demonology and cryptozoology decides to vacation in the desert of the American Southwest, taking his daughter Diana with him and come upon ""Uncle Willie's Desert Museum"" set up for tourists, which includes a rattle snake, bull skull, various baubles and indian bric-a-brac, but the real interest is back in the shed, wherein he preserves a supposed gargoyle skeleton excavated by his own hand. Suddenly, the entire shed is shaken apart accompanied by bestial cries, and ""Uncle Willie"" {played by Woody Chambliss, whom you will recognize as the dottering 'John' from 'The Devil's Rain'} is crushed in the fallout. The shed bursts into flames, as Boley and Diana barely escape the destruction, whereupon travelling to the next destination later that evening, are beset upon by a reptilian creature from out of the darkness. Bit by bit, these demonic creatures reveal themselves in an attempt to retrieve the desecrated remains of their fallen brethren, until finally kidnapping Diana and taking her back to their caverns, where she gains favor and receives the curious advances of the King Gargoyle.

The splendid Grayson Hall {'Dr. Julia Hoffman' from Dark Shadows} plays a 'Mrs. Parks' - motel manager and alcoholic spinster who is too soon literally strung up on a telephone pole by the gargoyles as a warning and decleration of war. Subtle shades of Vlad Tepes there.

With the sloppy aid of some dirt bike riders, the local yokel 'police' attempt to battle these subterranian dwellers, who desire to take over the world of man and make it their own. In the past, they seemingly attempted to co-exist, but humans became too antagonistic and killed off their kind at every opportunity, based on fear and ignorance. So now, with the rebirth of The Gargoyle King, they have remained within labyrinthine dwellings until the time when they were plentiful in number, to rise and conquor. Unfortunately, many precious eggs were immolated during the battle.

The costumes are impressive, with each character maintaining his or her own seperate identity, from scaled to hairy variations, from beaked to reptilian. I found the main Gargoyle to be quite remarkable, as a veritable Satan archetype even comparable to Legend's 'Lord Darkness'. They also each have personalities and voices, modes of expression and sentiment, which was a delightful turn from the usual sole grunting and hissing, which is only just a part of themselves. One of the female gargoyles actually becomes jealous at the attention Diana is receiving from the King Gargoyle, so she leads Dr. Boley directly to their location.

I would have liked to have seen more from these characters, and would look forward to any reproductions. This film does suprisingly well on such a condensed budget, mostly utilizing the naturally eerie enviroronment and sense of suspense during several well done lambent scenes wherein they emerge from the shadows, with long claws, gleaming fangs, piercing eyes, thrusting horns, and fanged rictus. This film could have just as easily been named ""Demons"".",1152144000,3,3288,5.172932330827067

How could anyone resist, ancient creatures thought to be nothing more than myth and legend are living in an isolated American desert region patiently breeding in the darkness of caves and caverns watching their numbers grow as they await the day to step out into the light of day and wage war against mankind as they did in aeons past. Now that's a storyline I can get into!

Cornel Wilde plays the part of a university professor specializing in demonology who uncovers the gargoyle community with his daughter played by Jennifer Salt (I had a crush on her for awhile).

Good, old-fashioned '70's entertainment that was able to frighten the viewer without having access to all the special effects one has come to expect today.",1143417600,8,822,4.864285714285714

We used to drive from San Diego to Tucson several times a year, so the thought of something like gargoyles living out in the desert at night was very real to us. We used to drive over at night and could always imagine something landing on the roof of the car, like the gargoyles do in this movie. To this day, whenever we hear a strange noise while driving, we say it is the gargoyles.

It is kind of cheesy when we watch it now, but it holds such strong memories for me of us kids all stuffed together in a chair with the sole purpose of getting scared.",1141603200,,699,4.057971014492754

951785,3,6304923082,"""Gargoyles"" is the greatest made-for-TV movie ever made about gargoyles starring Cornel Wilde. Seriously, this movie scared the heck out of me as a kid and my elementary school classmates were in an uproar the following day. We spent many a sleepless night imagining those gargoyle claws slowly reaching over the foot of the bed - yikes!

There are additional memorable images from this silly horror film, and perhaps this well-remembered monster movie is the perfect choice for kids on Halloween night. When viewing ""Gargoyles"" today, I am genuinely impressed by the makeup effects of the gargoyles. Actor Bernie Casey is unrecognizable as the lead gargoyle, and he gives a menacing performance. ""Planet of the Apes"" had come out a few years prior, and its pretty clear that sci-fi classic inspired this film. Watching the gargoyles hop around, snorting and sniveling, I was reminded of Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter in full makeup, frantically trying to save Chuck Heston from a lobotomy.

Wilde is an eccentric anthropologist who likes to toodle around New Mexico in a puke green station wagon (this movie was filmed on location in Carlsbad, with the cave sequences I am assuming filmed in Carlsbad Caverns). His daughter (the lovely Jennifer Salt) hitches a ride and they discover a skeleton of what appears to be a gargoyle. Well, all hell soon breaks loose as the surviving gargoyles try to take the skeleton back, and then for no apparent reason, kidnap Wilde's daughter.

While Jennifer Salt, adorned in white halter top and skin-tight jeans, has intellectual conversations with the king gargoyle in the echoing confines of Carlsbad Caverns, a frantic Wilde forms a posse made up of the local Barney Fife's. They recruit a long-haired motorcycle gang led by a very young Scott Glenn (in one of his first roles), and they head to the desert with everything from torches to pump shotguns. They then precede to take pot shots at anything that moves.

It's all fun, and about the only violent scene you'll find is a blood-covered seat in a pick-up truck. But when watching ""Gargoyles"" today, I feel a sense of warm nostalgia during these ugly days of Reality TV. Little Movie-of-the-Week horror films were quite common during this late 60s/early 70s era. Many a night I recall watching ""Crowhaven Farm,"" ""Something Evil,"" ""The House That Would Not Die,"" ""A Taste of Evil"" and ""The Night Stalker"" (which later became a famous TV series) and walking to school the next morning with friends to discuss the eerie particulars. It was an innocent time, and ""Gargoyles"" is a perfect example of that great TV period.",1101081600,18,2612,4.95662100456621
951786,5,6304923082,Genesis chapter six say is all about this prophetic film. This movie was so far ahead of it time. The original Americans have written of these powerful creations for generations. Coast to Coast radio show talk about the giant ones. This film is apparently more truth than fantasy.

951787,4,6304923082,"A made-for-TV flick that originally aired on CBS in November of 1972, GARGOYLES tells the story of an anthropology researcher (Cornel Wilde) who, with the assistance of his adult daughter (Jennifer Salt), travels to the Arizona desert to investigate an unusual skeleton discovered there. However, when the duo try to transport the bony remains away from the discovery site, they are pursued by a number of gargoyle-like creatures who want to reclaim the unearthed skeleton, and the scientist and his daughter soon find themselves at the locus of an age-old battle between mankind and an evil race of garrulous reptilians.
Yes, it's cheesy.  But for many horror fans who grew up in the 1970s, it's one of those guilty pleasures that, in spite of any intrinsic sense of good taste, will always have a special place in their nostalgic little hearts--right there next to Wacky Packages stickers and CRACKED magazine.  And to be honest, it's really not all that bad, especially when compared to a lot of the other tripe spewed by the one-eyed monster during the ""ME"" decade.
At times GARGOYLES can be really atmospheric, especially during the night scenes in which the titular creatures attempt to reclaim the bones of their dead, but at other times it is blatantly ridiculous.  The first half of the film actually plays better than the second, as the viewer is then offered only brief glimpses of the nightmarish reptilians as they swoop down on moving autos or attack folk in secluded buildings.  The ""magic"" quickly dissipates, however, when the creatures finally appear in full view and the audience can easily see the Gargoyles for what they really are--a group of actors and stuntmen in unconvincing rubber suits. The one exception to this rule is the make-up job on the Gargoyle king, played by former professional football player Bernie Casey.  This character looks like a greenish incarnation of Satan himself, and when combined with the eerie vibrato of his voice, he never fails to invoke plenty of gooseflesh.
In spite of the hokey premise of the plot and the rubber-suit monsters, GARGOYLES is definitely a must-see for serious horror fans.  There are some genuinely spooky moments, especially early on, and the film is also historically notable for being the first major professional gig for make-up FX master Stan Winston.  (Considering the masterful work he's produced in the years since--everything from Cicely Tyson's ""aged"" skin in TV's THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MISS JANE PITTMAN to EDWARD SCISSORHANDS to several incarnations of the TERMINATOR--it's not unreasonable to assume that he was responsible for the outstanding make-up of the Gargoyle king and not the rubber suits.)
The DVD from VCI is short on extras, and the image has that same softness common to older TV shows that are transferred to disc.  However, the digital transfer was made from the complete, uncut version of the film that was apparently screened only in Europe, and that means that even long-time fans of the show in North America may actually see a few bits they didn't see initially on CBS or during the film's numerous syndicated reruns.  Definitely worth picking up a copy.",1074643200,83,3162,5.030592734225621

951790,3,6304923082,"Pop-anthropologist/occultist Cornel Wilde and daughter Jennifer Salt are shown a bizarre skeleton, by an old desert coot out to make a fast buck. The wheezy geezer insists the bones are intact as he found them, but Wilde's experienced eye is certain it has to be a fake - even if an expert one. What kind of creature has bull's horns, a beak, and oversized bat's wings? The question is quickly answered, as the deceased beastie's living relatives besiege the shack, starting a fire that kills the old man and sends Wilde and Salt fleeing. They are bedeviled for the rest of their road trip by the demonic beings, who initially are intent on retrieving the skull Wilde took with him from the shack. Once they have that, their leader takes a shine to Salt, and decides she'd make a wonderful mother of monsters to begin a breeding overrun of the Earth...
The gargoyle masks and costumes won an award, and half deserved it - some of them look great (like the leader, Bernie Casey), and others look very much like the vacuformed plastic outfits they are. They're seen far too often to remain convincing for long. There's atmosphere to spare, but almost no suspense - a prologue to the movie gives away everything to come, in the first minute. The script should either have been expanded and developed, or shortened into a much scarier Night Gallery episode, which is essentially how it performs. The plot is pretty thin even for the short running time, and is heavily padded - a lot of time is taken up showing nothing more than gargoyles loping along the road. The ending, and a few of the plot transitions, are too abrupt.
The cast, however, are quite good, and there's enough lurking-in-the-dark creepiness to keep things moving. Scott Glenn appears in one of his first roles, as a dirt biker who has some problems with local law enforcement, and Dark Shadows' Grayson Hall has a good minor support role as an alcoholic motel owner. The location photography is terrific, and the film's colors are especially vivid. The production is handsomely mounted.

With a creepy soundtrack and amazing makeup by Stan Winston, Gargoyles was a fantastic scare for us.  I know a lot of people will roll their eyes and say that there's nothing scary about this film, but I think that is just because we have become used to non-stop action, explosions, shaking camerawork, quick-cut editting, and CGI monsters.
When Jennifer Salt is walking back to the motel in the dark and you hear noises coming from the darkness, well, I'm sorry, but that is just creepy.  When Bernie Casey (amazing as the head Gargoyle) emerges from the darkness, I still feel a chill.
This movie used to be on TBS several times a year.  It was on so much that I never bothered to get it on video tape.  Then when it stopped showing up on cable TV, I thought I might never see it again.  Thank goodness it is available again!  And on DVD!

It's up to an anthropologist and his plucky (and beautiful) daughter to save humanity.
Not for the beautiful sunsets, the magnificent desolation or even the pristine beauty of the desert has this TV movie become a classic.  No some magic, perhaps owing to race memories of the gargoyles draw us.  Or maybe it's just some childhood memory of Jennifer Salt in a halter top fleeing the gargoyles.

Yet, beyond that, there is the moral ambiguities of the main charachters (a bunch of bikers, first suspected for the Gargoyles' reign of terror, become the heroes), and the seeming open-ended finale.  There's an understated (probably unintended) message that the Gargoyles really should win out.  Strangely, with the cult status of this flick, nobody has ever given thought to a sequel.
