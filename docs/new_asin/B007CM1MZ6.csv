8514621,1,B007CM1MZ6,"ABSOLUTELY AWFUL !! - - - - This video was so bad, it truly looks like elementary school kids did it !!  Unsteady hand holding the camera....cheesy interview that was SO BAD that the microphone was apparently 30-feet away from Blaine Gibson when he was interviewed....I had to turn the volume up to the highest level, just to hear what he was saying.  This was like a home movie-quality (at BEST !!) for this entire video.  Just AWFUL !  I requested my money back immediately upon seeing this cheap imitation for a DVD !  The piped-in, cheaply done, Disney songs instrumentals was horrible as well....often, when the girl who was doing the shooting and interviewing was talking, you could not hear her or the interviewee over the irritating Disney songs that were played too high throughout this entire DVD. - - - This is a ""dog with fleas""....",1438732800,,844,4.675675675675675
