8494463,2,B000068PIL,"This DVD was OK, the pictures were fine, and I would have loved it except to two reasons.
1.  Each fire lasts about 10min.  I thought that I could just use my DVD's looping feature to make it last forever, but they locked that feature out. You see the fire fade to black every 10 min. it's kinda distracting.
2. The makers of the DVD have two DVD's with the same cover.  I thought that I was ordering the one with more features, but it turns out that the you can only tell which version of the DVD you have by reading the small print (Extended title) under Ambient Fire.
I would look for more before I bought this one.",1074038400,,618,4.133333333333334
8494464,2,B000068PIL,"This is the first fireplace DVD I have purchased and I would not recommend it to others. Most of the scenes were filmed a little too close and the music is heinous. The candle scene it nice for the holidays, but overall I think it could use some work.",1071792000,2,251,4.142857142857143
8494465,4,B000068PIL,"and I liked it.  The visuals are nuts in the one fireplace mode and the sound is pretty dope when you run it through a 5.1 system.
I didn't really dig the candles, kind of weak, but maybe you'd like it, I dunno.  Also, the card inside with pick up lines...hmmmmmm...not the funniest out there, but I guess you can't be all Martin Lawrence on a PG item...but it was aight.",1038009600,5,371,4.211267605633803
8494466,4,B000068PIL,"nadn this one is by far the coolest...some of the music isn't exactly what i would play, but the visuals are pretty sweet.  If you're into this kind of thing, this is not half-bad.",1028505600,4,180,4.294117647058823
8494467,4,B000068PIL,"This thing's pretty smooth.  I bought it as a joke, but it's actually cool.  It's got lots of different music and visuals.  Definitely handy if you're chillin' or if you're not.",1025136000,4,177,4.645161290322581
