8633923,5,B00HNWGJ9O,"For anyone  who is a fan of Orson Welles, this is a definite must! It's an astounding one-man-show, written and acted by Marcus Wolland. It's an incisive peek into the complex character of an iconoclastic genius, not fully understood or appreciated in his time.
Set during the time of Welles' ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" and how the studio basically rejiggered and 'destroyed' the movie while he was out of the country.",1432080000,,419,4.985714285714286
8633924,4,B00HNWGJ9O,"It's almost impossible to find out much about Marcus Wolland and his play Lost Edens from which this production has been excerpted (although it's a full enough experience in and of itself).

This is a crime.

Wolland is a marvelous Welles.

The play is a delight.

It's a blessing that Stage Direct (an ORGANISATION I've never heard of) has recorded it.

If you're a Wellesian

If you're a fan of REALLY good acting

If you're just a fan of REALLY good theatre, I can't recommend this highly enough (well, I suppose I COULD have given it FIVE stars, but what's a heaven for?)

Really, you should get this.",1359072000,,605,4.537037037037037
