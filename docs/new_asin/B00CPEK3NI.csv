5731935,5,B00CPEK3NI,"I've been watching Young Justice since the premiere, and it's one of the best comic-book series I've seen yet. The second season was pretty good, though the finale felt a little bit lacking. The episodes are (spoiler alert):

11. Cornered - Despero attacks the Hall of Justice while members of the Team are moving out. Mal becomes the new Guardian, and Blue Beetle teaches the Justice League of his involvement in the coming apocalypse (from Impulse's time).

12. True Colors - Things get complicated with Aqualad's braindeath, while the Reach is being investigated by the Team. Bumblebee and Atom try to remove Blue Beetle's scarab, with no positive results. The Team meets the Green Beetle, a Martian who is in alleged control over his own scarab, and he's willing to help them.

13. The Fix - Miss Martian is kidnapped under the supervision of Black Manta, in hopes that she can mend Aqualad's broken mind. Green Beetle apparently helps Blue Beetle take control of his scarab, but not for long...

14. Runaways - Four teens earlier abducted by the Reach escape from a League base, and Blue Beetle sacrifices his identity to help them. Red Volcano (remember him?) attacks the base, looking for Amazo's body parts. Later, we meet yet another Beetle (this time he's Black), who teaches us all that...Green Beetle is evil! Remember how he helped Blue Beetle control his scarab? Well, the opposite actually happened.

15. War - When the alien Mongul pilots his planetoid Warworld (think the Death Star) to earth in hopes of stopping the Reach, the Team goes inside to investigate. Later, Blue Beetle takes out all of them (except for Arsenal).

16. Complications - Nightwing goes to the Warworld to find out about what happened, but Blue Beetle lies to him (aw, Blue!). Miss Martian fixes Aqualad (who still fakes his braindeath) and they chill with Artemis (Tigress) until Artemis' family (without her mom) confronts them. They all start planning an escape, and later, Nightwing discovers Blue's treachery.

17. The Hunt - With the help of Lex Luthor, the four Reach runaways make it to the Warworld, and help release the Team (and Mongul) successfully.

18. Intervention - With Zatanna's help (remember, she's a Leaguer), the Team helps Blue take control of the scarab, while Miss Martian's relationships crumble.

19. Summit - When the Light and the Reach call a truce, the Team complicates everything and starts a melee. The public learns of the Reach's lying, and Black Beetle swears to destroy earth.

20. Endgame - While the Justice League is having their trial (for wreaking havoc on the planet Rimbor), both of the evil Beetles' scarabs are destroyed. When the League returns to earth, all of the heroes learn of the Reach's plot to destroy earth (by laying 20 bombs in different locations, which only certain technology to stop) and split up to do the work. Later, one bomb is missing, and Wally (as Kid Flash) dies in an attempt to stop it with Flash and Impulse. The Team reorganizes, and Vandal Savage meets up with Darkseid and G. Gordon Godfrey (the news dude) on Apokolips.

Since this season has 6 less episodes than the first, they included 3 episodes from the earlier DC series Static Shock (in which the main character makes some important appearances in YJ).",1371686400,27,3277,4.875899280575539
5731936,5,B00CPEK3NI,If you have seen previous episode then I recommend you buy this DVD as it only gets better . One of the Best shows shown on cartoon network and hopefully there will be a season 3.,1371081600,8,179,4.0
5731937,5,B00CPEK3NI,It's a shame when people who have no idea what they are doing are making decisions that impact the masses. That is just what happened with this wonderful cartoon. The IDIOTS at cartoon network cancelled this just because it didn't sell enough toys. RIDICULOUS!!!! This is by far one of the best cartoons ever. I would love to see full BluRay editions of the 1st and 2nd season. But you know that won't happen because cartoon network is apparently ran by mongoloids.,1370908800,60,465,4.682926829268292
5731938,5,B00CPEK3NI,I didn't watch this show on TV cause I didn't have much time but I got the DVDs and wowwww. What a great show. So sad to hear it got cancelled but I think they did a good job with the last episode so that at least you get some closure. Watch it! Neat little gem of a show,1370649600,3,271,3.610169491525424
5731939,5,B00CPEK3NI,"Cartoon network messed up putting this on early saturday morning. It should have been in the 8pm to 10pm time slot; it was meant for an older ordinance. The stories where great, the development of the characters was awesome, the artwork is great and the action was phenomenal. The downfall of this show was the time slot and the big time gaps between episodes. If you love comics, the JL cartoon, the JLU cartoon or the Teen Titans cartoon or are looking to get something you and the kids can see together and not go crazy or you are trying to get your kids into this is the thing for you. It is like the teen titans all grown up with lots of action and great stories. If I had any say in it I would have done at least three more seasons. There was lot's of more stories to be told. My opinion get the entire series now you will love it!!!!!!!!!!",1370476800,66,846,4.196319018404908
5731940,5,B00CPEK3NI,The end of the sieres was great but left me wanting more sad to see it cancled. They left the series/season with more storys to be told if any other network were to try and pick it up would be a huge asset.,1370131200,6,206,3.813953488372093

5731942,5,B00CPEK3NI,This was different because they moved ahead several years from last season. I liked this season but would have been fine with just them rather than adding a bunch of new people but  its all good.

5731947,5,B00CPEK3NI,"The season has more depth, intricacy, and layers than I can name.  Numerous plots and sub-plots all revolving around an attempted invasion of the Earth.

This shows the intricacies of an undercover assignment. To protect his cover Aqua Lad had to do horrible things and making impossible choices.  He had to do more than just convince the bad guys he was a Traitor.  He had to push things far enough that Young Justice wondered if he actually was a traitor - push things to the point K F didn't know if he was playing the Bad Guys or playing Night Wing.

Miss Martian came very close to the Dark Side.  She was using her telepathy to destroy minds.  She did that only to villains and used morality to justify it.  But still she was enjoying the pain of others, which had driven Conner away from her.  Eventually she repents and seek atonement.  She and Conner didn't officially get back together, but the look they shared said they certainly would.

The Justice League was on trial for their actions during mind control.  On trial in a corrupt world where Bribes were all that mattered.  Justice and Honesty meant nothing.  Ironically they'd been framed on a world where anyone could get away with anything, but their honor prevented them using bribes.  Super Boy and Miss Martian had to use that world's corruption against it, while still not violating the League's honor.

Blue Beetles origins are explained.  The Scarab is eventually enslaved be the invaders, forcing Blue to turn against the others.  Once the other save him, Andreas and the Scarab united as brothers against the invaders.

The Reach and the Light had a complex series of betrayal, deceit, and manipulation between them.  Each simultaneously assisting and undermining the other.  Each seeing the other as nothing but a means to an end.

Finally the finale forces an alliance between the Heroes and Villains of Earth. Luther actually helps save the World, to save himself of course.  K F sacrifices himself to save the others, the world, and most of all to save Artemis.",1501632000,,2040,4.765714285714286

5731958,4,B00CPEK3NI,"Young Justice Invasion is the second and sadly final season of the hit animated show that was stupidly cancelled for dubious reasons by WB and DC brass. Invasion actually throws you for a bit of a loop at the outset by jumping forward in time by five years from the finale of the first season. Mainly concerned with the cliffhanger of season one (that the top tier members of the Justice League disappeared into space for a brief period of time while under Vandal Savage's mind control), season two sees the team learning that Earth has become a target for alien invasion. With a newly expanded roster including Wonder Girl, the third Robin, Impulse, Batgirl and others, the best characters remain the stalwarts from season one. The time skip allows the show to include a legacy component that was quite appreciated, though the problem with this season is that the new team members never get their own chance to shine. Some like Blue Beetle and Impulse grow to become new leads in their own right, but others like Wonder Girl and Lagoon Boy are just background players. Also, a lot of the early episodes revolve around plot details from the missing five years. While some fun can be had with the time skip, you do feel that it was a missed opportunity to actually show details like Miss Martian and Superboy's relationship falling apart or Red Arrow's married life. Still, the season was solid as a whole and ends on a tremendous cliffhanger. Here's hoping Netflix sees fit to revive this awesome show.",1478131200,5,1502,4.714828897338403

5731977,5,B00CPEK3NI,My husband and kids say this was the best cartoon series ever.  The storyline for season two was written brilliantly.  The twists in the storyline left them on the edge of their seats for each episode.  The only disappointment was the cliffhanger at the end of the last episode and WB did not commit to a Season 3.,1457740800,,314,4.379310344827586
5731978,4,B00CPEK3NI,"Young Justice season 1 was very solid, easily the best animated superhero series ever!  Season 2 tries very hard to live up to its predecessor, but manages to stumble very hard.  For starters, it takes place 5 years after season 1 with a much larger team.  This means character & world building have to occur all over again.  This isn't necessarily bad, just irritating when doing a marathon.  What IS bad is the voice cast.  Although I like the addition of some more recognizable voices, one is far too recognizable.  The same voice actor plays 3 different characters in the SAME VOICE!  It even has a scene with those characters talking to each other in the same voice!  This was a major error, and really broke the 4th wall hard!  The conspiracy this time is also a little bit more far-fetched.  It's revealed what the Justice League during the missing timespan 5 years ago, but it's never revealed why they were ordered to do it.  At least, it's not explained well.  Finally, I don't know if this is a thing with the Blu-Ray, but when I watched it on Netflix, the subtitles were HORRIBLE throughout the series!  I feel like I understood less with the subtitles on, easily the worst subtitle job I've ever seen.
However, even with those stumbles, it still manages to go very strong.  You get to love this new crew just as much as the old one.  I found it particularly interesting to see how the team was strained this time like it was with the mole last season.  In fact, it teaches a lesson that really needs to be taught more today.  It's definitely very mature for a children's (or perhaps more like teenager's) cartoon.  It's probably up there in quality with the recent Flash live-action series, with as much intrigue as Jessica Jones.  What's particularly curious is that, although WB said they were not interested in the possibility of crowdsourcing its return (it was cancelled due to poor toy sales), reports are coming in now that season 3 is actually in the works.  Hopefully this time the drama will stay on the screen and not bleed over into the real world.",1456790400,,2073,4.594005449591281

5731980,5,B00CPEK3NI,This show gets better and better! I love the addition of new members as the years progressed. This was something seriously lacking in Teen Titans. I'm so sad that the show was cancelled with only two seasons. Hopefully it will come back someday!,1456444800,,245,4.72093023255814

5731990,5,B00CPEK3NI,"Sadly this season brings the epicness of Young Justice to a close, even though it ends very open noted. With a little less episodes than its predecessor season, Invasion really brings you a ton of plot, characters, epic moments, crying moments, and memorable moments in only 20 episodes that you'll be asking for more.

Invasion picks up 5 years after the first season and brings in a slew of new people that you'll fall in love with, while also seeing the evolution of the sidekicks from season 1. This season is much more plot-centric in that everything ties together, and you can really see that there was a ton (a ton!) of thought put into this season which makes it more sad that we may never get a season 3.

5732015,3,B00CPEK3NI,"This is not a horrible show, however I can't understand why everyone is
praising it so highly. To me, it is a slightly better version of Teen
Titans. For the record, I am not a fan of that show either.

For one, the main characters hold no appeal to me whatsoever. I have no
interest in watching a show about obscure teenage sidekicks such as
Aqualad, Superboy, Kid Flash, etc. Give me Batman, Superman, Wonder
Woman and Green Lantern any day over their teen-aged counterparts who
I'd rather forget even exist.

Also, I don't view this as a very mature show. Everyone seems to be
going on and on about how mature this show is, but if you're watching a
show comprised of a bunch of 13-year olds dealing with things like
crushes and other adolescent type problems, how is that very mature?
It's absolutely ridiculous to suggest that this show is more mature
than say Batman: TAS or Justice League/JLU. Granted, the writing is
decent and more complex than most kids shows so in that regard it is a
little more mature. BUT, let's keep this in perspective people!

The character designs and overall style of the show are just ""okay"" to
me. I'm not at all a fan of anime and while this show isn't really
anime, it definitely draws some inspiration from it. It certainly is an
improvement over Teen Titans, which is much more clearly anime to me.
However, I would prefer if the show bared no resemblance to anime at
all.

Overall, this show is not bad. I just think it is overrated and more of
a kids show. Nothing wrong with that at all, and as far as kids shows
go it is pretty well done. But as an adult, I couldn't get into it and
can't understand the high praise specifically for maturity that it has
received.",1440720000,,1708,4.429936305732484
5732016,5,B00CPEK3NI,"Great set. Now I have to go back and get season 1. Too bad it only had 2 seasons. I may have gotten into it this late,  but it still makes me wonder if a season 3 would have been just as good.",1440115200,,192,3.4651162790697674

Their problems have escalated to a full on worldwide scale, and the tone is appropriately darker than the prior season. There will be a point in this show where you just can't stop watching. Awesome twists, great characters, engaging plot...by the end of it you'll be sad that it never got a chance at a season 3.",1437091200,,498,4.423913043478261

The show takes place five years after the end of Season 1 with little exposition, filling in the gaps over the first few episodes.

This series is made for binge-watching; it pulls you in within the first few episodes so much that you can't wait to see the next episode. They expand the roster for this second season, adding Wonder Girl, Beast Boy, Batgirl, Nightwing (plus Tim Drake Robin), and Blue Beetle. Blue Beetle steals the show early on. There's tragedy, redemption and plot twists a-plenty in these action-packed episodes.

They also add the runaway heroes and a few added villains. The voice-acting is top-notch, the score and sound effects superb, and the fight choreography is brilliant. This show makes Sportsmaster a decent villain:)",1428278400,,885,4.966216216216216

5732087,4,B00CPEK3NI,"Young Justice: Invasion, the renamed second and final season of the animated series, is much more watchable than the first season. At the start, weve jumped ahead in time five years, which means the characters aren't so whiny and juvenile, a plus. The overarching theme is battling alien invaders. First, there are little, lizard-like aliens hiding in human-looking bodies (as in Men in Black). The Justice League and Young Justice split up to send a group to Rann to investigate the plot while other groups break up the encroachers secret headquarters on Earth.

As the season progresses, there are different attackers, from Mongul to various friends revealed to be enemies in disguise and vice versa. Soon enough this turns into a super-villain group vs the superhero group, with a revelation of a surprise twist related to what happened over the five-year gap. Finally, theres a group of aliens called the Reach that kidnaps humans to experiment on them. They also are attempting to infiltrate society from the inside, presenting themselves as allies. A particularly entertaining subplot to me was G. Godron Godfrey (Tim Curry, excellent casting) riling up anti-alien paranoia from his TV show with a greasy, insinuating, all-too-realistic tone. Using aliens allows for battle without ramifications to the kids, unlike fighting humans.

The Young Justice team, managed by Nightwing (voiced by Jesse McCartney), often splits up into Alpha, Beta, and Delta Squads, so we get different combinations of heroes. Key players (and their actors) are:
Blue Beetle (Eric Lopez)
Robin (Cameron Bowen)
Superboy (Nolan North)
Miss Martian (Danica McKellar)
Beast Boy (Logan Grove)
Bumblebee (Masasa Moyo)
Lagaan (aka Lagoon Boy, who has the Hulk-like ability to inflate himself into an imposing muscle-bound appearance) (Yuri Lowenthal)
Wonder Girl (Mae Whitman)
Batgirl (Alyson Stoner)
Wolf, a giant white dog who apparently joined in S1

Its great to see more characters in the regular cast. I also liked seeing mention of the bigger Justice League as well, since that means glimpses of lots of favorites (including Rocket!). Later on, theres a spin-off group featuring Static and three reworked Super Friends (Tye/Apache Chief, Ed/El Dorado, and Asami/Samurai), which I found both amusing and surprisingly effective in a modern story.

But first, theres an intriguing episode not really suited for a childrens cartoon in which former teammates try to help a burned-out Red Arrow  (Crispin Freeman) obsessed with finding the original Speedy. He fulfills the really angry character part that Superboy has since grown out of. The show, because of more complex motivations like that, kept my interest much more than recent animated DC movies or the previous season did. I can see why it didn't go over well, though, since its a fairly major change in direction to expand beyond the boys 7-11 target category.

A continuing focus on Blue Beetle allows for further exploration of the theme of aliens among us, since his powers and supersuit come from a scarab possessing him. Various revelations play out in future episodes, such as when Artemis (Stephanie Lemelin) returns. Young Justice: Invasion seems to have been conceived as a real series, with continuing ramifications, even as the episodes have their own stories. The alliances and motivations are much more pleasingly complex than I expected.

The animation here looks very good, building a compelling world. Since the series was cancelled abruptly, there are a few minor loose ends left, but nothing substantial or atypical of the genre.

The Blu-ray set has two discs for 20 episodes, 10 on each disc. The second disc has commentaries for the series finale episodes Summit and Endgame by show creators Greg Weisman and Brandon Vietti and voice actors Jason Spisak (Kid Flash) and Stephanie Lemelin (Artemis). Theres also a 16-minute Behind the Scenes featurette filmed halfway through season 1 teasing whats coming up with the show joining the DC Nation programming block.

You will not want to skip any episode or watch them out of order because it won't make sense.  The writers of the series have woven together a very complex storyline tied to the events of the first season with many plot twists that you don't see coming.  As with the first season it is obvious that the second season was written in its entirety and then produced and televised leaving very few if any unanswered questions by the last episode.  I didn't think it would be easy to top the first season however the YJ writers exceeded my expectations.  This is a truly quality series.,1420934400,8,714,4.496124031007752

5732121,5,B00CPEK3NI,"Young Justice was a very good show, on par, in my opinion, with the original Batman:  The Animated Series and more entertaining than Justice League.  Unfortunately, the network did not agree.  I assume the ratings were low, and, in what seems to be an effort to save the show, the writers went about 5 years into the future and added a lot more characters to the story.  The plot is actually very good, as the group of teens try to handle aliens coming to earth and villainous sub-plots.  Sadly, Cartoon Network couldn't make up their mind on whether or not to show the series and kept pulling it on and off the air with no warning (once it ""returned"" for two weeks only to disappear again WHILE McDonald's was doing a toy promotion for the show).  Long story short, this is the final episodes of Young Justice and the series is definitely worth checking out.",1418860800,,859,4.509677419354839

 1) Commentary Track on Series Finale Episodes Summit and Endgame with creators Greg Wiesman and Brandon Vietti, along with voice actors Jason Spisak (Kid Flash) and Stephanie Lemelin (Artemis).
2) Interviews with Greg Wiesman and Brandon Vietti.

5732132,5,B00CPEK3NI,"""Young Justice: Invasion"" was a very different season from the first season. The characters are more mature, darkness consumes the atmosphere, death occurs more frequently. Yet, it remains extremely enjoyable! A true writer's talents are revealed when they can simultaneously evoke emotions of sadness and emotions of joy within the same episode, without feeling forced. Bruce Timm and Alan Burnett did this with ""Batman The Animated Series"". Joss Whedon does this with all of his work. And, Greg Weisman and Brandon Vietti are masters at this. Vietti, previously having directed ""Batman: Under The Red Hood"", and Greg Weisman, previously having done ""The Spectacular Spider-Man"" and ""Gargoyles"", bring their A-Game with Young Justice Invasion. Season 1 effectively brought the audience in to the vast world of Earth-16. Season 2 allows the creators to fully dive in, head first, within the DC mythos. As a result, this season can be overstuffed at times, but unlike other television shows, Invasion properly pays off all running plot by the seasons conclusion, barring the story regarding the real partner of the Light, which would have been dealt with in the season 3. The audience will quickly gain an attachment to all characters. That being said, certain characters, such as the new Robin, are not focused on very much. Because the Tim Drake Robin remains one of my favorite characters in the comics, it does sadden me he did not get as much screentime as I would have liked. That being said, characters such as Tim Drake still feel like real characters. Real people. Each hero receives a standout moment within the season. ""Young Justice: Invasion"" is a masterpiece. A flawed masterpiece, but nevertheless, a masterpiece. For people who want a continuation, buying the Blu Ray for season 1 and season 2 will greatly aid in that endeavor.",1415577600,32,1843,5.105960264900662

5732139,3,B00CPEK3NI,"Animation is not bad, we also get to see the main Justice League members in a couple of episodes which it made it more interesting, I guess my biggest problem with this show is that it shouldn't be titlled ""Young Justice"" but ""the Blue Beetle, or whatever his name is show"". Almost every single episode evolves around this character. I didn't even know who he was before I watched this cartoon. So no bueno man. They had a very interesting mix of heroes here so why not take advantage of it? Besides, once again DC and Warner Brothers decided to neglect and power down all the female super heroe characters. I won't be surprised if Wonder Woman participation in the New Superman sequel movie for 2016 is reduced to almost nothing and they also powered her down like they always do with all the female characters in tne DC universe.",1411862400,,831,4.546666666666667

5732175,4,B00CPEK3NI,"The Young Justice is what the Teen Titans television series should have been. Even though it's about some of the same heroes, the difference between these two series is night and day. The Teen Titans is clearly aimed at children, whereas this can be enjoyed by anyone who's a fan of comic books and super heroes, adult and child alike. This DVD contains ten episodes on two DVDs which, quite frankly, is something of a ripoff. I recommend waiting for Warner Brothers to release the full season on DVD, which will end up costing you one-half or even one-third of the price of purchasing the season in separate parts, as well as giving you the entire season in one collection.

Some noteworthy longer story arcs in these episodes:

1. Miss Martian is deathly afraid of using her psychic powers because of the way she abused them in Season 2, Part 1. This has ramifications in some early episodes and comes to a head halfway through the season.

2. The Reach and the Light both have their own plans, some of which develop slowly over the full ten episodes. As you might expect, neither side is fully truthful and there are some surprises in store, particularly in the final episode.

3. The Blue Beetle also develops in some interesting ways throughout these episodes and not always in ways that our heroes would prefer.

4. As was the case in Part 1 of Season 2, not everything is what it seems, as there are spies, counter-spies, and betrayals galore, along with some unlikely allies (under the theory that ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"").

5. This is one of those ""darkest before the dawn"" series, with setback after setback inflicting our young heroes, to the point where I was wondering if the writers were ever going to let them win one! Personally, I think the season could have used more balance.

On Disc 1:

Cornered - The old Justice League foe, Despero, is re-imagined as a super-strong Galactic hunter, eager for personal combat, for a challenge, for trophies to mount on his wall. He surrounds the Hall of Justice with an impenetrable force field, then attacks the heroes within, mostly members of the Young Justice team, aided by Captain Marvel. Despero has a moderately annoying robotic aide, Elron, pretty clearly modeled on Booster Gold's Skeets. This was mostly a filler episode and it showed.

True Colors - The Reach partner with Lexcorp to increase food production. The Young Justice team is sure that something is going on beneath the surface so they go undercover to find out more. This episode introduces a new Beetle warrior, a Green Beetle from Mars. Is he an ally? A foe? Only time will tell. A subplot shows an angry Sportsmaster demanding ""an eye for an eye"" in return for the death of his daughter, Artemis. The other members of the Light refuse to let him take out Aqualad in revenge and they have in mind a replacement for the disgruntled Sportsmaster...

The Fix - The team has asked Miss Martian to psychically read the Green Beetle, to confirm whether he is on the up-and-up. Can Miss Martian bring herself to use her psychic powers again? She may have no choice, since Black Manta has decided that there is only one person who can heal his son and he's determined to bring her in, sending Tigress (a disguised Artemis) and Deathstroke to capture her. Can M'gann repair the damage she caused, repairing a shattered mind? In the meantime, the Green Beetle has agreed to help the Blue Beetle bring his scarab under control.

Runaways - In Part 1, we were introduced to some young people who were captured and experimented on by the Light and the Reach. In this episode, we're reintroduced to them as they are being investigated by the scientists of Star Labs in order to determine the effects of the Reach's manipulations. The kids are not particularly happy with their status and so they break out. In a sub-plot, some of the Amazo body parts were sent to Star Labs for safekeeping, since the Hall of Justice was destroyed in an earlier episode. One of Red Tornado's brothers, the Red Volcano, has decided he wants those parts. The kids, along with the Blue Beetle, decide to engage but is there something wrong with the Beetle? And what will happen to the kids when all is said and done?

War - In this episode, we find out just a bit more about the past history of the Reach and we find that they are not the only would-be conquerors in the galaxy. A somewhat reimagined Mongul decides that what is happening on Earth is a threat to his own plans for galactic domination, so he takes his War World, a mobile doomsday vessel slightly smaller than Earth's moon, developed millenia ago by an extinct alien race and now under Mongul's control, to Earth. If he can't dislodge the Reach from Earth, he'll destroy the planet. Can the Reach, the Justice League, and the Young Justice team cooperate to save the planet? And what secrets will be revealed in the process?

There really were some stunning graphics in this episode and the key to the ultimate success was interesting. Plus, there is one final surprise...

On Disc 2:

Complications - Something has happened to the Young Justice team on the War World. But what? Can Nightwing put the pieces together and figure it out? And Manta gives Miss Martian an ultimatum: fix Aqualad in 24 hours or die. Two other people have a different idea, though, as Sportsmaster and Cheshire infiltrate Manta's sub to avenge the supposed death of Artemis.

The Hunt - We find out what happened to the Young Justice team, including one member who is still at large and fighting against the forces of the Reach; Arsenal. But can he singlehandedly free his comrades and take on the Black Beetle? He needs help and he gets it, from two unlikely sources, including the one individual who has the power to go toe-to-toe with the Black Beetle. We also start to see the plans of the Light developing, as it becomes clear that they have some ideas of their own.

Intervention - Can the Young Justice team solve the problem of Blue Beetle, once and for all? An intervention is in order. But an intervention in the heart of enemy territory? And which will be more effective: the science of the Reach or the magic of Earth? And is all what it seems or is the team dancing to someone else's tune?

Summit - The Reach and the Light have much to talk about, as both of them have grievances against the other. A summit is held, staged in a cavern deep under the earth. The summit does not go well, erupting in conflict, but cooler heads prevail. Unfortunately, in the process, Artemis, still under cover with Black Manta, is revealed which, in turn discloses Aqualad as a double agent. Fortunately, the Young Justice team has a few surprises up their sleeves. Unfortunately, so does the Light.

Endgame - The Reach have been driven off the planet but they have one final ace to play, an ace that threatens to destroy the planet. Can Lex Luthor, the Justice League, and the Young Justice team unite to defeat that threat? And who will pay the ultimate price in the process?

Peeves:

- Impulse's use of the word ""crash"" just gets annoying. I felt like saying, a la ""Mean Girls,"" ""Stop trying to make 'crash' happen!""

- The character of G. Gordon Godfrey, annoying talk-show host, really didn't work for me. I assume that the character is intended to be a cross between Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh but, as voiced by Tim Curry, all it did was irritate me. I was expecting that there would be some payoff for this, some comeuppance as had happened in a prior Justice League episode, but it never happened.

- Use of ""the Light"" again as the primary villain. It was good in the first season, since it was kept hidden for much of the season and since the mystery built to good effect throughout the season, but now that we know the truth in the second season, this basically became just another attack by the Injustice Society. I can't help wishing they had gone in a different direction.

- The cliffhanger postscript ending, frankly, didn't make much sense. I can't say more without giving away too much, but the alliance suggested in that postscript just didn't work for me.

Despite the peeves, there is a lot to like in this series, which is why I'm giving it four stars. There are decent individual storylines and story arcs throughout the season, very good animation for a television series, and, of course, a lot of action. It's still a worthwhile addition to the Warner Brothers DC Universe canon and I can recommend it (although I still recommend waiting for the full season to be released).",1394236800,,8553,4.6222808174027685

Be warned, you must buy Part 1 of this season or you simply will not understand everything that's happening -- but the purchase is worth it.

5732188,4,B00CPEK3NI,"I love the show. The Young Justice episodes themselves average a 5-star rating. See my review of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Young-Justice-Invasion-Destiny-Calling-Season-Two-Part-1/dp/B009OAWMK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Young Justice: Invasion Destiny Calling - Season Two, Part 1</a>&nbsp;for an overview of the Second Season YJ episodes. So why only 4 stars? Basically, WB blew it big time when choosing their ""bonus episodes"". The Season One Part 1 DVDs selected 3 episodes of BATMAN: THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD, each of which gives us some good background on the character of Jaime Reyes, the Blue Beetle. Those were excellent choices to help spotlight that particular character, who plays a big part in the Second Season of Young Justice.

The YJ S2 Part 2 collection would seem to attempt to spotlight Virgil Hawkins, aka Static Shock in the same fashion, with 3 bonus episodes. However, here's where it's an epic fail. All of the Batman The Brave And The Bold episodes guest-starring Blue Beetle had been previously released on DVD, but many of the purchasers of this series on DVD may not have bought that show, due to its overall difference in approach to YJ. That's OK; they cherry picked just the ones that were relevant to Blue Beetle. If you didn't own BTBATB on DVD, the Season 2 Part 1 collection gave you just the BB-related episodes. Maybe you might decide you like BTBATB after watching them, and you can go out and purchase those shows on DVD.

With STATIC SHOCK being used for the bonus cartoons on the Season 2 part 2 collection, that complete series (4 seasons/52 episodes) has never been released by WB in its entirety on DVD. They did release a single-disc DVD that has the first 6 episodes from the first season. The first 2 of those same 6 episodes have again been chosen to be included on this collection as bonus episodes. The first deals with Static's origin, so perhaps that needed to be included for those not familar with Static's own series. A third bonus cartoon is Episode 12 (""Replay""), which has been seemingly chosen at random, since it has no particular significance relative to the DC Universe.

However, and here's where it's frustrating, there were 7 episodes of the STATIC SHOCK series that had guest appearances by other characters from the DC Universe:

""The Big Leagues"" - Dakota gets a real jolt when the Joker hits town, recruiting a band of Meta-Humans to wreak his own special brand of havoc. Batman and Robin appear, pursuing the Joker. Static must put his hero worship in check as he teams up with the Dynamic Duo to put a shock to Joker's system.

""Hard as Nails"" - Static travels to Gotham City to rescue Nails, a school girl friend of his who has fallen in with Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy, who are promising to cure her of her Bang Baby affliction.

""A League of Their Own"", Parts 1 and 2 - When the Watchtower has a sudden power drain, the Justice League are forced to recruit Static to ""jump-start"" their station before it re-enters the atmosphere. Unbeknownst to either Static or Gear, the power drain also releases Brainiac from confinement.

""Toys in the Hood"" - Static teams up with Superman when the Man of Steel's old nemesis, Toyman, appears in Dakota.

""Future Shock"" - After helping Batman with a case, Static finds himself accidentally sent 40 years into the future, where he has to help the Batman of that era, Terry McGinnis, save a captured superhero: Static's future self. (Static Shock later appears in the JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED series as a adult member of Batman Beyond's Justice League, in sort of a sequel to this episode.)

""Fallen Hero"" - Static faces off against his idol, Green Lantern (John Stewart) when he causes chaos all over town. This is an instance of a voice actor ""talking to himself"", as Phil LaMarr voices both Static and Green Lantern.

NONE of those episodes listed above has EVER been released on DVD, so what does WB give us as their choices for bonus cartoons? - 2 episodes that were already included in the 6 out of 52 episodes of the show that HAVE been released, and one other random episode. If they absolutely had to limit themselves to only 3 bonus episodes, I would have picked ""A League of Their Own"", Parts 1 and 2 and ""Future Shock"". They could have just included a commercial for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Static-Shock-The-New-Kid/dp/B002JUFPY0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Static Shock: The New Kid</a>&nbsp;to refer people to the first 6 episodes if they had further interest in watching the show.

My only real issue was the time jump. This season is set quite some time after the original and the core team has expanded exponentially. I got the impression this was the storyline the animators were planning for their fourth or fifth seasons and, having advance warning that the show would not be getting a third season, jumped forward to that point (don't know whether that's true or not, it was just the feeling I got from the early episodes). While this was not a problem storywise (indeed, it was handled really well, with clever reveals spaced out over the early episodes) I would still have loved to have seen how the team developed from season one to the time period set here.

If the manufacturer, Mattel, had made a better quality toy at a better price option, they would have sold just fine.  Mattel should lose the licensing with DC Comics due to their poor management of the brand.  That being said going back to the DVD.  If you are a fan of DC Comics, which I am, this is a must have.  My daughters and I watch this together and love the storyline along with the great introductions to not so famous characters of the DC Universe(Adam Strange, etc.).

5732226,4,B00CPEK3NI,"""Did Young Justice Season 2 Part 2 live up to your expectations?""
That was the question I received from Amazon via email. Here's the thing-
It did and it didn't. I purposefully waited to watch this until I had a physical copy after the series ended on Cartoon Network. I was excited to watch it, enjoyed it thoroughly, and felt that it rounded out the entirety of the series to some degree. What I didn't appreciate though, was that the last few episodes left me unsatisfied. The series was rushed in the end, leaving more questions unanswered and making things sit with a poor taste in my mouth. I loved it, but I hated what Cartoon Network forced the series creators to do it all on account of the networks shoddy management. ""Teen Titans Go!"" is a horrible replacement, and its conception was never necessary- but even so, it's fruition brought about the rushed epilogue to Young Justice which left me sad and bitter- especially when an iconic character is killed when it wasn't even necessary to off-him, all for emotional appeal that should have pertained to the first season when he was more regularly seen, rather than the second season when he hardly got any time on screen. Another thing I didn't enjoy was the open cliff-hanger at the end of the final episode, featuring Darkside, as a teaser for either the game that is still in development, or for the continuation that will never come.
In short, this addition to the series is great, but it may leave you angry at Cartoon Network for its hasty, if not idiotic, decisions.

If you liked the older Justice League (unlimited) cartoons you will love this!  The characters from the League always make cameos, mostly Batman, Black Canary, Aquaman, Superman, Captain Marvel, Captain Atom and Red Tornado.  The story is complex and there is a plot line that lasts through out the 2 seasons as well as having a lot of stand alone stories.  ENJOY!!!",1376784000,,542,4.712765957446808
5732228,4,B00CPEK3NI,"I decided to review Young Justice as a whole rather than each volume separately. My only real complaint about this series was a lack of connection to the DCAU. Much as I tried, there were too many inconsistencies (spoiler alert: Wally West dies at the end of season 2) to even pretend there might be some continuity with the previous series'. I suppose if I had a second complaint, it would be the way Wonder Woman was drawn (watch Young Justice & Justice League side by side & you will see what I mean).

Now on to the good comments. The story arcs for each season are compelling and intricate. The characters (of which there are many) are deep. And there isn't really one character that makes you say ""I wonder why they included them?"" Everyone has a purpose. Each season is full of so many twists and turns, it makes you want to go back and watch it again to make sure you didn't miss anything important.

I was extremely disappointed when I found out the show was being cancelled. With the introduction of Darksied, it felt like we were being teased with a cliffhanger to be continued, but no. I was even more disappointed when I saw what was replacing it. For two years, I had something to look forward to every Saturday morning. Now, I sit quietly eating my cereal, sipping my coffee and hoping Cartoon Network will come to their senses & realize cartoons can be more than fodder for toddlers who have short attention spans and only watch for the bright colors and silly sound effects.

As for the packaging, I can't fathom why they felt the need to split season 1 into 4 separate packages other than to get fans to spend more money. Four episodes per disc to me seems like a waste of plastic. The cover art on each case is unremarkable. As for special features, there are none. That's not to say there isn't bonus material, but it's not very special. Despite not being part of the previous DCAU, I would love to give this DVD series 5 stars. On it's own, it certainly deserves it. But due to the first season being broken into 4 disks & the lack of special features, I'm giving it 4 stars.",1376697600,,2096,4.410852713178294

If you are in no big rush I might wait for a similar set for season two in a year or two.  Saves plenty of bucks that can be used for other great DC Comics titles. :)",1376352000,,430,4.083333333333333

5732235,5,B00CPEK3NI,"I'm sorry to say that WB canceled another amazing animated series in Young Justice. After two seasons, this incredibly designed, animated, and well written series had the plug pulled so that inferior, mind numbing drivel could be put in it's place. It's hard to fathom. I would recommend this animated series to anyone who enjoys superheroes. It is top notch, and a very enjoyable series from start to finish.",1376092800,,409,4.942028985507246

5732237,5,B00CPEK3NI,"Young Justice was one of the best, smartly written superhero series on TV.  SO, naturally I guess it needed to be removed for brainless cartoons like Sponge Bob, etc.
Both seasons 1 and 2 were great fun to watch, both for my wife and I as adults, and also for our three children.  (Our 3 year old daughter still sometimes will smack her head and say ""Hello, Megan"" when she messes up!)
The only drawback I would have with this last disc is that it seemed like they tried to wrap things up a little too quick once they were informed the show was being cancelled, and now we won't know what was supposed to come for the next season!",1376006400,,630,4.241666666666666
5732238,5,B00CPEK3NI,"Just when I thought Justice League was going to be the last decent cartoon on TV that kids and adults could both enjoy, Young Justice came along to renew my faith in animation and by proxy humanity.  I kid on that part, I still have not faith in humanity.  Outside of wit, this show is animated spectacularly, the story is ROCK solid and the characters, wow.  There is nothing bad I can say about this show, they took old villains of the classic DC universe, took old heroes, and spun them just enough on their side to make them feel brand new.  Throw in a deep seeded conspiracy and there is and amazing TV show for you.

I'm just sad that they stopped after only the two seasons, I would have loved to have seen more.  Also, good to watch this show and the previous seasons to know who a few of the newer characters in Aquaman's party are in the new move Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox, which I will be reviewing soon too.

Anything more that I can say about this show?  Well heck, you want 1000 words or the pictures...watch the show, you'll like it.
Thanks for reading and have a nice day!",1375833600,,1101,4.310679611650485
5732239,5,B00CPEK3NI,Young justice was a very good series.  A very good disk and has many episodes per disk.  A great deal.  Unfortunately this is the last of the episodes.,1375747200,,151,4.321428571428571
5732240,5,B00CPEK3NI,"As with most characters literary or otherwise, every few years a new iteration of a property is derived to present the most contemporary depiction of their universe. While some are memorable (Batman: The animated Series, Superman: The animated Series, Justice League, Teen Titans, Batman Beyond), many often fall short of the mark (Legion of superheroes, Zeta Project, Static Shock (Sucks), The Batman (Uuugggh), or at best simply fail to live up to the success of past interpretations. Young Justice chronicles the adventures of the younger counterparts of the DC universe's more familiar ensemble of heroes as they adjust to venturing out on their own and forming a a team to combat threats the Justice League cannot otherwise address. And unlike many of the other disappointing depictions of some of DC's most beloved icons, this is one of the better DC animated series available. The story lines in provide the viewer with just the right amount of insight into each of the jr leagues cast of characters, without focusing on one or two. There are enough cameos from the greater DC universe to appease even the most die-hard fans. And the occasional appearance of Bruce greenwood as batman is always welcome. The animation is stellar, and there never feels like there is a throwaway episode in terms of the animation. Similarly the artists have done a remarkable job of creating modern versions of the characters, that are true to there origins, but appealing to a younger audience. As a guy who is pushing 30, no children, very active, a firefighter, martial arts instructor, who is super handsome, I very much looked forward to each Saturday afternoon and finding this recording on my dvr.",1375747200,,1693,5.00709219858156
5732241,5,B00CPEK3NI,"I am hooked on this series starting Season 1 - Episode 1.  It provides a fresh look at the superheroes from serious teen perspectives, unlike previous attempts like Teen Titans and other 90s young heroes short takes.  The drama is quite suspenseful and the storyline arcs across many episodes, much like the Justice League, but with much less death and impossible violence.  Sure, the teen heroes are capable of taking down whole buildings, but not the entire city blocks like those final epic battle between Superman and Darkseid in Justice League.  The characters are deeper and more interesting.",1375660800,,598,5.071428571428571

5732243,5,B00CPEK3NI,"My collection of Young Justice is finally complete from Season 1 to 2.
This continues Season Two of Young Justice. The disks are two. The first one is dark blue and the second one is red. Both consist of five episodes each. Compared to the previous disks of Young Justice, the menu is different and simple. The main menu is the cover of the DVD disk. The rest of the screens once you go through them are just red. There are subtitles, and audio changes. There are three special episodes available and they are from Static Shock. It makes sense to add these episodes since Static Shock is a character introduced to the Young Justice world. His biography of his powers have changed. There wasn't enough time to really see Static Shock in Young Justice. From the episodes seen, Virgil is characterized as someone in my opinion: loyal, brave, and a teen who is okay with his powers and idolizes the heros at some moments. Besides Virgil, I really enjoyed seeing new characters such as Asami, Tye, and Ed. Then I saw the original Roy Harper become Arsenal. Everything came together. I saw a lot of characters in the spotlight and I wanted to see more moments from certain characters. I saw Zatanna and Rocket be totally awesome. I saw relationships develop. There was sisterly love between Jade and Artemis. There was a problem with Mal and Karen that started from the begining to the end. It showed the issue of growth. I didn't really understand Wonder Girl and Robin because it was so sudden. It was like whoa. Compared to the first season where all the relationships developed had a few hints here and there. That one was surprising. I really wanted to see Jaime reunite with Tye as himself.

The season wrapped up pretty nicely done since there were only ten episodes. We learn more about Blue Beetle, the scarabs, the Reach, the War world and the characterization with a lot of characters. We see it all wrap up and show the madness to going undercover and solving the Blue Beetle. I really didn't expect the last episode since it closed the door and opened up a few more doors. I've seen a possible season three plot occur if the show does pick up again.

It has been said that there is a possible resurrection of Young Justice if more products are bought concerning Young Justice such as the upcoming video game. No season three was ordered due to the lack of sales from action figures. Yes, action figures. It takes more to run the show with all the money it takes. if you have questions, you can look it up and see all the possible reasons why there is no season three.

I bought the series since I buying it to view just online or on Itunes is more expensive and useless since I prefer using my DVD player or computer to view it. Overall i enjoyed the series and I would recommend anyone who just wants to watch it. If you prefer it itunes or amazon then go for it.

A great introduction for those unfamiliar with Static before his stint (sans costume) on Young Justice: Invasion. Dvds include English, French and Spanish with English subtitles. Main play screen shows same cover artwork, while episode menu screen is generic.

Shows like Justice League/Unlimited, Batman: Brave & The Bold and Young Justice/ Inavasion were the ONLY real reason I ever watched CN.

The anime style is my personal favorite of all the DCU shows, The problem with this & the other shows being canceled isn't necessarily about sales of toy lines or specific merchandise. It's the fact that these shows are being sold as children's programming to advertisers. The DCU shows have always done well in the ratings, just with the wrong demographic. I know I'm not buying cereal, candy or toys. That's why the networks keep going back to DCU and saying "" younger, younger"". Look at the Teen Titans retread. That's aimed @ 5 year olds. If they would have the guts to sell these programs as grown up fare, and admit that's the audience they've been getting since Batman TAS premiered almost 25 yrs. ago, everybody would be lot happier!",1372464000,3,836,4.655405405405405
