8513001,3,B0079R1L2S,"Based on the unproduced play ""Rivets,"" this uneven pre-Code melodrama belies its reputation as a contractual throwaway for fading MGM star John Gilbert. ""Fast Workers"" (1933) makes the most of its Depression-era atmosphere with surprisingly brisk direction from Tod Browning in a rare non-horror outing. Gilbert (whose cynical portrayal dispels the myth that his voice was unsuitable for sound) and the underrated Mae Clarke deliver solid performances. Try though he might, Robert Armstrong cannot overcome his miscasting as the stereotypical ""dumb lug""  thus lessening the impact of the film's destructive romantic triangle. Largely unseen for decades, ""Fast Workers"" is a flawed yet fascinating curio worthy of revival.",1526169600,,721,5.738317757009346
8513002,4,B0079R1L2S,"While the title could have been better suited to the movie, or at least more catchy, this is a great movie.  Part-comedy and part-drama.  It's about two friends who are steelworkers for skyscrapers.  Of course, there's (scheming) dames here, too.  It's one hour and 5 minutes with no filler.",1510444800,,291,4.877551020408164
8513003,4,B0079R1L2S,"In this 1933 pre-code film, John Gilbert and Robert Armstrong play romantic rivals for the character played by actress Mae Clarke. The film was based on a play by John W. McDermott.

John Gilberts tenure as a matin&eacute;e idol at the studios had descended into the dusk due to a series of misfortunes of his life. He was known for his ill-temper and frequently clashed with studio head Louis B. Mayer over many issues, including a physical attack on him during the alleged double-wedding of Greta Garbo and John Gilbert; and director King Vidor and actress Eleanor Boardman. Mayer vowed to end his career, and thus the long and painful decline of Gilbert comes to an end in this film as his contract with MGM also ends. In spite of all his misfortunes, the film is still interesting and enjoyable to watch.",1455494400,,808,4.690140845070423
8513004,3,B0079R1L2S,"Fast Workers is a 1933 comedy that combines the fascination of high rise construction with the smoldering sexuality of pre Code films. The 1454 foot high Empire State Building was completed in 1931, and was featured in King Kong in 1933, a film that starred this films co-star, Robert Armstrong.

John Gilbert (1189-1936) headlines in his last contract film with MGM, as a riveter with a randy disposition. This film was quite a comedown from his films with Garbo when he was one of the biggest stars of the silent screen. He only made 2 more films (including Queen Christina with Garbo) but youll find his acting in this film one of his best talkie roles.

Mae Clarke (1910-1992) plays Gilberts love interest. She will forever be known as the blond moll who got a grapefruit smashed into her face by Jimmy Cagney in Public Enemy (1931), but she made over 100 films and gave us many memorable roles, such as Dr. Frankensteins wife in the original Frankenstein (1931) and Myra Deauville in Waterloo Bridge (1931). Clarke does a great job in this film, and its one of her best.

Robert Armstrong (1890-1973) plays the third end of the love triangle and Gilberts pal. He will always be best known for his role as hunter Carl Denham King Kong (1933) and Mighty Joe Young (1949) even though he performed in 160 films including Palooka (1934), G Men (1935). Man of Conquest (1939) and Blood on the Sun (1945). In this one, Armstrong play a dim wit, which was quite a difference to his usual fast talking roles.

Sterling Holloway (1905-92) has a small role as one of the riveters. Holloway is best remembered for his Disney roles (The Jungle Book, Alice in Wonderland, The Aristocrats).

Tod Browning (1880-1962) was one of the most unusual of all Hollywood directors, and thats saying a lot when you consider the list of characters includes Wild Bill Wellman, John Ford, Sam Peckinpah, Alfred Hitchcock, etc.

Brownings peak was in the silent era, when he produced such classics as the Unholy Three (1925), London After Midnight (1927), and The Unknown (1927), but he is best known for the classic Dracula (1931) and for Freaks (1932). Browning was the first and truest of the American directors to adopt the German expressionist techniques and themes, and he embraced them to such an extent that he outdid the originals. None of his considerable skills are on display in this one, but he does an adequate job.

Bottom line - A forgettable film from the early 30s,.but it does have excellent performances form John Gilbert and Mae Clarke.",1440115200,,2533,4.75626423690205

Directed by Tod Browning
(MGM, 1933)

This is a racy pre-Code comedy starring John Gilbert as a dashing, two-fisted, hot-tempered steeplejack named Gunner who travels the country working on high-rise jobs with his buddy Bucker, a big, tough lug who's a bit smarter and more sensitive than he seems. The two pals have a peculiar ""system"" for ensuring they either stay single or wind up with the ""right"" girl: whenever one of them starts to fall for a dame, the other makes a pass at her and, inevitably the gal proves unfaithful, and the two guys remain footloose and fancy free. But even the best system is bound to hit a glitch, and this happens when they run into the glamorous, no-nonsense Mary (an arresting performance by a gorgeous and strikingly modern Mae Clarke).

This is the kind of movie fans look for in pre-Code material, with raw, frank sexuality not far under the surface -- lots of rough talk from the guys on the construction crew, and a lot of time spent watching the men pick up women in speakeasy bars. The scenes of the men working on the girders of a skyscraper are fascinating as well, evoking a bygone era of vitality and expansion in American life. Director Tod Browning adds some nice touches, including some cool trick photography and use of rear projection.  The look and feel and the sweaty scent of Great Depression America all ooze off the screen -- many thanks to whoever spent the time and money to rescue this rare film from oblivion. Also, for fans of character actors: keep an eye out for a young Sterling Holloway, who usually had much smaller parts (and eventually was cast as the voice of Winnie The Pooh, decades later...) Highly recommended! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1363910400,7,1737,4.707236842105263
