Some may argue but all agree that his athletic prowess was unmatchable in his day. In these films, he gets to show some of that, albeit choreagraphed, to a great extent. In Shao Lin Kung-Fu, Bruce plays the role of a man who is being tracked down by a ruthless general out for revenge! Martial arts madness! In Deadly Strike, my personal favorite martial arts movie of all time, Bruce plays the role of a smalltown sheriff who is a clear upgrade to the halfwits running the place. A ruthless gang is terrorizing the locals and basically owns the local government. Sheriff Ching, Bruce's character, has a big problem with that and decides to go to war! He hires a group of prisoners to help him defeat the mob and protect the good people. Multiple martial arts fights with extreme violence are what these two films were meant to be and they deliver the goods! This is not for kids! Two rare yet good action movies!",1498694400,,1017,4.5027027027027025
