6248416,4,B00I3P8XT4,"I'm giving it 4 stars because its a really good series (I love it) but for some reason the kids don't. They'll watch an episode seem to have fun but then not want to watch another. I imagine this is because many of the situations the characters find themselves in are more adult in nature. For example the pains of getting a pet (its all fun and games for kids), moving out on ones own and even quitting something addictive. I found the episode about them trying to give up bacon very amusing as I feel the same about trying to quit sugar but a kid just can't relate to that.",1438473600,,575,4.1891891891891895
6248417,5,B00I3P8XT4,"Robot and Monster, where do I start? It was one of those shows that my son started watching on Nick and I told myself that I wouldn't watch. Well three episodes later and I was hooked. Yeah, I know a adult watching a children's show but you know it is just down right fun to watch, it's kinda like the modern version of Fred and Barney except the setting is in the future. I just wish they hadn't ended the series, oh well at least the one or two seasons they were on has been preserved on DVD. The case contains all 5 disc, which I found to be handy! A must for your collection if you are a hardcore animation nut.",1428105600,3,615,4.049180327868853
6248418,5,B00I3P8XT4,"I didn't know what it was about this show, maybe I still don't, but it took about two episodes to become my favorite.  Visually it grabs your eyeballs and hugs them for twenty-something minutes straight.  When it's over they feel cold and alone even just a nose away from each other.  That's what probably sucked me in at first--the people behind the show knew how to push animation to its potential.  On a deeper level, storylines with a perfect amount of silliness.  Under that, a solid enough structure to keep you glued.  At its core, the message to me is a fuzzy warm kind of zen, the best kind.  That's not a bad message for a ""cartoon"".

I don't get why Nickelodeon didn't seem to see the potential in the show.  From what I understand it was meant to tide things over during a lull in programming.  The thing is, there's no tiding here, there's no lull with this show on the air.  Apparently the only people that see that though are the creators and a few of us willing to stay up until 3am EST.

As far as the media itself goes, it's a bare-bones DVD set.  If any animated piece of art deserves blu-ray and extras it's this one, but I'll give it this--as far as DVD goes it's a 10 for me.  It still looks great on an HD TV.  It does 16x9 perfectly.  I can see barely any signs of compression (looking reaaaally close, all I can see is a faint hint of color banding, and in normal viewing it vanishes).  I don't understand why it's available on Amazon and iTunes in HD but not something you can actually own (in your hand).  My guess is too-conservative budgeting, and if so then that's a shame.  It's so good though I've actually thought about springing for it again on Amazon.",1424476800,4,1686,4.329073482428115
6248419,5,B00I3P8XT4,"A REALLY funny, clever show for adults that kids can enjoy as well. The concept is brilliant, the character development is excellent, the dialogue is smart and funny, and the overall writing makes this easily one of the best sitcoms on TV. The DVD has two unaired episodes, which is why I'm buying it. I just wish they made a LOT more episodes. If viewer feedback makes any difference, see the show and write Nickelodeon if you agree.",1422576000,3,434,4.576923076923077
