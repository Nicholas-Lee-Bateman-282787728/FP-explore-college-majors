551418,4,6303060293,"This 1934 hour-long, black and white, grainy, 80-year old film is fun to watch. Wayne, a US Marshall is sent to a town where gunmen kill sheriffs. He intends to jail the criminals and bring peace. George Hayes, later known as Gabby, without a beard and humorless, has an unusual role. The film is as deep as a kiddy pool. Some parts are silly when seen from a modern perspective, but this adds to the fun. So, too, when Wayne constantly tells his Indian partner to do this and that, without PC, this is from our perspective ridiculous and fun. On an alphabetical rating, Id give it an E or F, perhaps a G. When we see Wayne riding sometimes on a brown horse even though his horse is white, we might be tempted to raise the rating, from the point of fun to a B, hence my rating of four stars.",1461110400,,791,4.2105263157894735

551519,5,6303060293,"This film had everything a John Wayne fan would want. There was plenty of horseback riding with stunts done by Wayne himself, a fight scene with fisticuffs, that of course Wayne won, and plenty of people getting shot (with no blood mind you). The highlight of the movie to me was when the heroine saw a weirdo outside her window she picked up her trusty six-shooter and started firing away. She then had a peaceful nights sleep. She even remarked about it the next day. The NRA would be proud. She plugged a bad guy outside her window and didn't miss a wink of sleep.

Now with that being said, as you can figure out the acting is not the best, but the action shots are great. John Wayne, as usual can shoot a man dead off his horse from a mile away, while he is bouncing up and down riding his horse. It was funny to see the ""bad guy"" fall into the water while wearing his gun belt, and 6 shooter, then in the very next scene climb up on the river bank with no gun belt on. In one scene ""The Duke"" had an empty holster, a clearly visible empty holster, in the same scene he turns to get the ""bad guy"" and his holster clearly has his gun in it, you gotta love this.

551525,5,6303060293,"The Star Packer, 1934 film

A man packs a bedroll on his horse. An Indian paddles his canoe to shore. Two men plan to hold-up the stage coach. Al Davis is the new Sheriff. A man called the ""Shadow"" operates a gang of robbers and rustlers. A man jumps out of a tree to take their money. Two robbers shoot the drive and guard, the horses run away with the passenger! But they are stopped. In town a hidden man shoots the Sheriff! There is a volunteer. He follows two men into a saloon. They go to an inside room for orders from a hidden man. The money from the stage coach is found and returned to town by Yak. The two men report the results to that hidden man, they are told to go to their hideout. These men are watched by the Sheriff and his Indian friend.

One man tells how his cattle were stolen. Can they get help from the government? They've tried without success. [A comment on economic conditions?] The new Sheriff Travers tells Matlock what he found. Should she sell out? A man receives a telephone call about the departure of the Sheriff from the Matlock ranch. [How many knew this?] The Sheriff departs. [Recognize this ranch from the other movies?] Two men arrange an ambush but are stopped by Jack's lasso. [Long shots suggest a body double.] The one that rode away is caught, there is a fight. Travers wins. The two men are jailed. The Sheriff inspects that room and finds a tunnel! Where does it lead to? The young woman sees a face at her window, she screams then fires her pistol. Who was hurt? She will stay on the ranch and fight it out. The Sheriff takes one prisoner out of the jail to receive a message. Is there a reason to change clothes?

That hiding place is uncovered, the man taken out. Will her talk? Not is some action occurs! Sheriff Travers runs to that saloon. We see how he escapes. Travers tells how he was sent from Washington as a US Marshal; he will swear in the other ranchers as deputies to go after the crooks. The cook tells Miss Anita about the imposter. ""Its that fool girl."" [Was that a double?] A mirror flashes a warning, they're coming. That very large gang follows the wagon. There is shooting. [You know the end is near.] The horses separate from the wagon, which goes over a cliff into the lake. One man paddles a canoe on a river to get away. A few years later we see what the future holds.

This has a complex plot that works. Were there any implausibilities in it? Overall, its better than the average dramas in this series. Notice how the female star never repeats, unlike the male actors? George Hayes was from Buffalo NY. Was this plot similar to the movie serials of that day? Was the combination of Sheriff and Indian similar to the ""Lone Ranger""?",1376524800,,2706,4.363095238095238

551601,2,6303060293,"Here's your chance to see John Wayne when he was a B movie maker, churning out 5 to 10 forgettable films a year with titles like ""Born Reckless"" (1930), ""Arizona"" (1931), ""Texas Cyclone"" (1932), etc. Then in 1939 he made ""Stagecoach"" with John Ford, and his new career as a major star began.  Stagecoach earned 5 Oscars including Best Picture. Wayne followed up with  ""Dark Command"" (1940) directed by Raoul Walsh, and  then a series of war movies (e.g.,  ""Flying Tigers"" in 1942, ""The Fighting Seabees""  in 1944, ""Back to Bataan"" and ""They Were Expendable"" in 1945) and his classic westerns including ""3 Godfathers"" (1948),  ""Fort Apache"" (1948), ""Red River"" (1948), ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" (1949, ""Rio Bravo"" (1959), and ""The Alamo"" (1960) . Wayne was nominated for Best Actor for ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" (1949) and he would finally earn an Oscar for ""True Grit"" (1969).

This was the 7th of 16 films Wayne made with Monogram/Lone Star Pictures. Monogram churned out films by the month, with little attention to detail or character development. Wayne said - ""For any actor trying to get on in the business, working at Monogram was not a good career move. Most of the contract players there may have had regular work, but they generally didn't move up from there into the major studios - they went down and that's the direction I thought I was headed.""

In 1934 alone Wayne made 9 films, all of them westerns. All but one included George ""Gabby"" Hayes"" who was Wayne's sidekick in dozens of films from 1933 (""Riders of Destiny"") to 1935 (""Rainbow Valley"") when Hayes moved on to partner with Hopalong Cassidy and later with Roy Rogers and then Gene Autry.  Hayes (1885-1969) made nearly 200 films between 1929 and 1950.

In this film, Hayes (without his customary beard) plays a bad guy, which is one of the few times he played a villain.

Wayne's sidekick in this film is Wayne's long time mentor, stunt man, double, and good friend, Yakima Canutt (1895-1986). They first worked together on ""The Shadow of the Eagle"" (1932) and made dozens of films together. As Canutt became more hobbled from injuries, he turned to directing and had a successful career as a second unit director handling action scenes.  Wayne gave him his first chance in ""Dark Command"" (1940). He went on to work on films such as ""Ivanhoe"", ""Spartacus"" ""El Cid"" and ""Ben Hur"".

BTW - Wayne and Canutt appear suspiciously like ""The Lone Ranger and Tonto"" which started as a radio show in 1933, the year before this film was made.

Earl Dwire (1883-1940) plays a bad guy in this film and most of the Wayne Lone Star films. Dwire ultimately made more than 150 films between 1921 and 1940.

The film was directed by Robert Bradbury (1886-1949), who was the father of another 30s western star, Bob Steele (1907-1988), who was a good friend of Wayne from their USC days (Wayne and Steel appeared in 6 films together between 1953 and 1970). Bradbury's other son, Bob's twin, dubbed the songs Wayne sung in the Monogram films (and he used the money he made to pay for medical school). Bradbury made more than 100 films between and 1918 and 1941.

FWIW - Bradbury's 1926 silent film ""Davy Crockett at the Fall of the Alamo"" was Wayne's inspiration for his own 1960 Alamo film which he directed and in which he starred.

1934 was an OK year for films. The top box office slots went to ""Viva Villa"", ""Cleopatra"" and ""The Barretts of Wimpole Street"" and ""It Happened One Night"" was the big Oscar winner. That year ""The Thin Man"" series began, Karloff and Lugosi appeared in ""The Black Cat"", Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers danced in ""The Gay Divorcee"", Laurel and Hardy laughed it up in ""Babes in Toyland"", and Howard Hawks' ""Twentieth Century"" came out. There were no real major league westerns apart from the oat burners produced by Lone Star, but westerns were popular in serials, such as ""The Red Rider"" starring Buck Jones and ""The Law of the Wild"" starring Rin Tin Tin.

There's not much to see here except for historians of the western film and for people curious enough to wonder how ""Gabby"" Hayes did as a bad guy. Of course, stunts by Canutt in his young days are always good to see, and personally I never get tired of the young John Wayne.",1305936000,,4209,4.649595687331536
551602,5,6303060293,"Just another western movie, with the good guys out for the bad. There have been mysterious murders in the small western town. An newly inducted sheriff is on the hunt for the killer. I remember watching it when I was a kid, back in the cowboy and indian days. It really brings me back, especially since it looks and sounds MUCH better than it did when I first saw this classic.

551604,3,6303060293,"Everything the first reviewer wrote he/she took off of the back of the DVD case.

The Star Packer is a old movie from the 30's & the acting isn't that good. If John Wayne had made this movie 10 years later it would have been pretty good. He folds up the legs of his new jeans & it looks really awful. If you watch this movie look for this. If it wasn't for Mr. Wayne the movie would really be awful.",1095033600,,399,3.925925925925926
551605,4,6303060293,"""Riders of Destiny"" was the first of the many Lone Star/Monogram Westerns in which John Wayne starred in 1933-35, with ""Star Packer"" being another. But this first one is of additional historical value because this is John Wayne as a singing cowboy. Granted, the singing is dubbed by Bill Bradbury, one of the twin sons of writer-director Robert North Bradbury (although since there is no official credit the matter remains a disputed issue), but still, you have to admit it is a rather mind boggling notion, like how the title really has anything to do with the plot.

 In this 1933 film Wayne stars as Singin' Sandy Saunders, who also happens to be a government agent. James Kincaid (Forrest Taylor) has taken control of the water in the area and is willing to grant water rights to other ranchers at exorbitant rates. One of those being exploited is the lovely Fay Denton (Cecilia Parker), so Sandy takes a special shine to her. Meanwhile he plans on sinking Kincaid's operation by opening up a lost river and sending the bad guy to a rather ironic but richly deserved fate. Our hero also does some pretty fancy shooting in the requisite gunfight near the end.

 Wayne certainly looks uncomfortable during the singing parts of ""Riders of Destiny,"" but there is something compelling about watching him try. One thing to remember with these Lone Star Westerns is that the one person who is also well worth watching, when you can spot him, is the famous stuntman Yakima Canutt, who plays one of Kincaid's henchmen. In this one his big stunt would be as Kincaid during the bad guy's death scene. You will also spot George Hayes, who plays Charlie Denton in the early part of his career before he was known as ""Gabby.""

 If you think ""The Star Packer"" is a strange name for this 1934 wesern wait until you see how the bad guy, known as ""The Shadow,"" uses a fake wall safe to give orders to his gang. Actually, this is the most atypical of these westerns to this point, the eighth of the sixteen that Wayne made between 1933-35. Wayne plays U.S. Marshal John Travers and this time around he not only has a sidekick, but it is legendary stuntman Yakima Canutt playing an Indian named Yak. He is actually the main attraction here (although not for his portrayal of a Native American), doing many of his famous stunts in ""The Star Packer,"" such as saving the stagecoach and the basic but always popular falling off a horse.

 The plot has Travers and Yak on the hunt for the Shadow and his gang. When Sheriff Al Davis (Tom Lingham) is killed, Travers becomes the town's lawman and sets a trap for the Shadow so we can find out who he really is; of course, all you have to do is look at the credits for the film because in terms of the Lone Star stock company during this period it has to be either George Hayes as Matt Matlock or Earl Dwire as the henchman Mason, which is enough to ""spoil"" the surprise right there. The complication is that lovely Anita Matlock (Verna Hillie) catches the eye of our hero as soon as she is rescued from that stagecoach, but since she is only Matlock's niece she is not really all that tainted by the relationship.

 ""The Star Packer"" continues to be unique right to the end, as we have a more specific happy ending than you usually find in these B Westerns. Like most of Wayne's Lone Star films this one is written and directed by Robert N. Bradbury and has an above average amount of horse riding and fisticuffs. But in the end all of the differences just make ""The Star Packer"" unique, and not really better than the rest of the series even though the tagline proudly proclaims, ""He fought for justice--and battled for love!""",1091059200,,3654,4.53951367781155
551606,5,6303060293,"The Star Packer is another success in John Wayne's long line of Lone Star westerns. Your best deal to purchase this film is to buy the double feature DVD. Also on the DVD is ""Riders of Destiny"", which is also great.
  John Wayne is cast as the marshall of a town that must defend from murdering outlaws. Two of them are captured and put behind behind bars by Wayne and his partner, Yakima Canutt. The others are still causing disturbances, so Wayne must order to whole town to go up against the murderers. I will not reveal the ending. See it for yourself. Also, don't listen to critics who call it the ""same old boring B- picture"". Their attention spans aren't all that hot. Get this on DVD, or VHS soon!",1087862400,,705,4.374045801526718
551607,4,6303060293,"John Wayne was taking care of business in the American West throughout the 1930s, as evidenced by this 53-minute film from 1934. Star Packer seems like a really weird title, but the movie itself is a quite enjoyable show, albeit one of standard Western fare. The Duke plays Travers, a fellow sent out by the federal government to try and bring a little law and order to a town being terrorized by the minions of a mysterious villain called ""The Shadow."" Sheriffs in this town have a habit of being [killed] right out on main street in full daylight; the local ranchers are explaining this to brand new sheriff number 3 when he finds this out for himself. Wayne rides in to town alongside his Indian sidekick Yak (Yakima Canutt), having foiled the latest stagecoach robbery and saved a little lady in the process. He assumes the role of sheriff and works to ferret out The Shadow and his posse of outlaws. There's very little mystery as to the identity of the man in question, but there's plenty of horse racing, ... action, and fisticuffs to make this a most satisfying early Western film. Throw in Gabby Hayes, and you've got a real showcase of the Duke at his early best.",1051401600,,1173,4.563981042654029
551608,4,6303060293,It was a bit disappointing that John Wayne was the bad guy at first. What caught my eye and got me digging for more information was the horse he road in on.
