4851531,3,B005O9MH62,"I read the reviews before purchasing this video, yet, I ordered it anyway. Even though I am in total agreement with the other two reviews and find the narrator's talking over the French historian quite annoying, this video gives me information to better understand Versailles' history. I ordered several videos - The Louvre, Impressionists, Marie Antoinette, Napoleon - in preparation for our upcoming vacation to Paris and watched them before watching this video.  One glaring mistake in the video that seems to have missed the editor's review is that section showing a room supposedly of King Louis XVI and describes him a warrior who spent many years in battle. The portrait is of a man with long, dark hair and the room has other portraits of his many mistresses. Obviously, from every account I've read, this cannot be Louis XVI.

I found it difficult to follow, but worth purchasing and watching. It's good to get information from more than one source!",1375574400,6,958,4.944099378881988
4851532,1,B005O9MH62,"Skip this DVD if you can, english voice over is loud and sounds awful. The background music is terrible the movement from room to room is awkward. What  nice, is seeing the rooms as they connect to each other.",1348963200,9,209,4.358974358974359
4851533,4,B005O9MH62,"The HD quality video portion of this DVD is state-of-the-art. 5 stars.
Unfortunately the soundtrack is headache-inducing. I had to take a break at the midway point.
The original production featuring narration by on-camera experts (speaking in French) is well-done.
The English voice-over is terrible. A male voice
""talks over"" the sections featuring male French speakers. A female voice for the corresponding  ""talk over"" of the lone Female expert.
And ""talk over"" is the best way to describe it. The volume of the French speaking experts is left at such a high volume that both audio tracks compete to be heard.
I would have greatly appreciated a subtitle track and no English ""over talk"". I doubt that even a viewer literate in French would be able to follow the original audio track.
To add to the displeasure the voice-over ""talent"" employed seem to be doing a ""live"" one-shot narration. Especially the female voice. Not at all ""polished"".
The best viewing experience is achieved by muting the audio and watching the HD video.
Where are the subtitles?",1333843200,23,1055,4.994318181818182
4851534,3,B005O9MH62,Not enough interiors to see.  Most of the rooms are empty and closed.,1409184000,,69,4.3076923076923075
4851535,4,B005O9MH62,"Not as good as the Secrets of series, however it is older....Still very good though.",1408924800,,84,4.666666666666667
4851536,1,B005O9MH62,"Beyond horrible. What's the matter with the people who made this? To begin with, they should have chosen a language and stuck with it instead of having them both drone on at the same time! How did they manage to make such a fascinating subject so tedious? Have they never seen Lucy Jarvis' NBC documentary, The Louvre? Versailles is the product of a century of inspired and sustained creative genius but the approach of this crappy video would have been more appropriate to the telling of the story of the development of the quonset hut. The good news is that this subject is still available for a documentarian of imagination and daring. DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO.",1405555200,3,661,4.6581196581196584
4851537,1,B005O9MH62,I found this DVD  poor the English translation over the top of the french to be very irratating and this version is a very old version I have been to Versailles and let me tell you if I had not been this DVD would certainly not incourage me to want to go and visit it.  NOT A GOOD PURCHASE WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.,1401321600,2,310,3.9838709677419355
4851538,3,B005O9MH62,"I like the footage of  the palace and and the history of the rooms, but I hated that it was a voice-over! The people describing the rooms were speaking in French, then you had to wait for the translator to come on and tell you what they were saying and most of the time they were going at the same time. It got very annoying fast...I only made it about 45 mins in before I had to turn if off.",1397520000,3,392,3.9
4851539,4,B005O9MH62,Nothing written can describe the opulence of this palace. I'm sure it would be a sight to behold.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars was I would like to have seen more.,1397088000,,178,4.085714285714285
4851540,1,B005O9MH62,"We couldn't watch this DVD.  Two people talking at the same time makes no sense.  Kultur Films are superior in many ways.  Great videos with fantastic music, but this video was disappointment.  Didn't the director understand that noone can focus on two spoken voices talking at the same time.  Sub titles are bad enough.",1390089600,,320,4.851851851851852
4851541,1,B005O9MH62,This DVD was so bad I couldn't sit through it and returned it for a full refund. Save your money.,1389398400,,97,3.9
4851542,1,B005O9MH62,"I had high hopes the other review complaining about the narration was overstating the problem. It wasn't. The English isn't narration. It's translating the French in the background, which makes the whole DVD noisy! The translator has almost no vocal inflection and seems, at parts, to be breathlessly struggling to keep up with the French track underneath. The video isn't narrated. It is strung together faces and sound bytes from curators and people who work at Versailles and not much video of the palace inside. Strange and sad. I turned it off after 10 minutes.",1388793600,10,566,4.968421052631579

8480992,4,B005O9MH62,"Nice eye candy. Lovely photography. The only flaws are the ""cracks in the facade"" of the structure of Versailles it's self. Certain ""restorations"" and curatorial  privilege have not gone far enough for me but at least they removed the equestrian statue of Louis XIV from the forecourt.",1501977600,,285,5.0638297872340425
8480993,4,B005O9MH62,"Beautiful to look at, but dubbed in English, no subtitles, moved very, very quickly, hard to follow the dialog as the French was also the same tone as the English.",1489708800,,163,4.466666666666667

8481000,1,B005O9MH62,"the spoken English over the spoken French drove us crazy.  Having visited Versailles we were hoping to know about its history.  Who originally conceived it, how it was built and over what time-frame.  We know it is really fascinating--how it functioned, was managed and how all the back room intrigues were carried out.  By the half hour mark we were asleep from this bore.",1412380800,2,373,4.78125
