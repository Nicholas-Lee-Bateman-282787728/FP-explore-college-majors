2625771,5,B000H1RFFK,"As a Christian, I found this video very enlightening.  I believe that every Christian must familiarize him/herself with the basic beliefs of other religions in order to be a strong witness for Christ.  Once you understand them, you can search the scriptures for God's point of view.  Barbara Walters did an excellent job of providing us with this type of information.  She was a proper interviewer, not invoking her own beliefs; allowing her guests to speak freely without feeling challenged.  I too was amazed at the many strange beliefs, and even the conflicting beliefs among people who supposedly share the same religion. But I feel the interview did its job.  It enlightened us, gave us new insight into what is right or wrong with society as it is, gave us deeper understanding of what it is we need to pray for.  Thank you Barbara.  You saved me many hours of research.",1342051200,2,876,4.754966887417218
2625772,1,B000H1RFFK,"Personally, I thought Barbara Walter's interviewing techniques could really use some brushing up. She did not really even begin to ask the hard questions, even when there were contradictions at times that should have been followed up. For example, the people of Buddihism believe the Dalai Lama to be a living God, yet when B.W. asked him if he truly is, he says no. Okkkk....and that whole reincarnation bit? If Heaven is only a temporary waiting room, this endless merry-go-round of reincarnation would get old really fast. What they fail to grasp is that no one can get it perfect here on earth, thus they are forever condemned by their teachings to be reincarnated. If their Dalai Lama, who admits himself that he's not enlightened, can ever reach that state of enlightenment, then they would no longer have a Dalai Lama. There was just so many things that B.W. could asked about, but she preferred to flirt and laugh with the guy instead.

And the version I watched tonight had Joel Osteen in it, and a slicker preacher I've yet to find. He totally preaches the prosperity gospel, and does not even begin to be a true Man of God as he admits himself that he avoids anything controversial in his sermons. That man is gonna have a lot of explaining to do with the Lord one of these days.

I just kept shaking my head throughout this whole thing, and could not believe how even the so-called Christians were so wishy-washy and far off the mark on some things. The first half of this really to me seemed to be focused on people doing enough good works to get into Heaven, and from a Christian perspective, that's not gonna get you into Heaven. It's believing that Jesus Christ is the son of God and came to die for our sins. He is literally the ONLY way in. But you wouldn't know it from watching this show. The few Christian preachers portrayed on this show did not stress this point, and instead came off as vague and trying to be politically correct. Guess they forgot that the last thing Jesus cared about was being P.C.

Overall, this show just came across as being very superficial and not really a worthy documentary. I feel like B.W. deliberately picks people who are not gonna rock the boat as it were, so she doesn't feel like she has to really be an actual interviewer.",1341532800,3,2281,4.545012165450122
2625773,5,B000H1RFFK,"I saw this special when it originally aired on ABC a few years back.

Barbara Walters handles the subject matter beautifully! I thoroughly enjoyed watching this again and again on DVD.

This documentary gets its information from both sides of the table. Anyone who watches this will NOT be disappointed.

It goes into great detail about different opinions of God and Heaven. The title says it all. BUY THIS.",1219622400,4,407,4.869565217391305
2625774,5,B000H1RFFK,"An intriguing look at what heaven means in many different religious traditions, what people who claim to have had near-death experiences believe about the afterlife, and why heaven has such a powerful hold on the popular imagination.

I wonder what Barbara (who is Jewish) was thinking as she questioned a Palestinian prisoner? And the flirting with His Holiness the Dalai Lama... Babs really...",1182038400,5,395,5.26984126984127

8135987,4,B000H1RFFK,"Seek and yea shall find, not accept and you will find. It takes an open mind and sincere effort to find truth.
Having studied the commonality of ideals of capitalistic democracy, communism and religion worldwide its disconcerting to find throughout the ages the majority of resources serving extravagance, hierarchy and consolidation of power often achieved and maintained through the exploitation, depredation and ignorance of the common man  - Not to mention the persecutions and ravages caused by related warfare.
Such social entities go great lengths to create the perception of order from chaos, then fill in the discontinuities with canned patriotism, the requirement of faith to obtain eternal life, or worse avoid eternal hell.
It seems many people need structure, ritual, definition  ...an iconic supernatural entity to embellish, plead their cares to, worship And integral reward system to derived security from being destined for eternal life.
Although within all creeds and religions there are exceptional individuals with characteristics and values worthy of emulation, its common to project lesser human qualities unto the character of the divine and worship, cater too and regulate others accordingly while depending on divine intervention instead of taking personal responsibility to create a sustainable world and purifying ones motives while realistically aspire to whatever brings about the greatest possible harmony for all things.
Must we subscribe to exclusive assumptions without reservation and continually seed the beds of worldwide ecological disaster, convolution, divisiveness and strife?
... And why not goodness for its own sake? What could be simpler, more purifying, self-affirming, divine in character ...and to the point!

Religions with by far with the greatest following are those having integral reward systems i.e. those that promise eternal bliss and other incentives for adhering to an assumed supreme doctrine. Though there are those of religious orientation with admirable motives, many delude themselves of having genuine love/devotion, the real fascination and motivation deriving primarily from celebrity like status and power of religious figures and promise of an eternally blissful after-life. Take away the embellishments: Business-as-usual insurance policy.

 Secure in being raptured and eternity bound beliefs based on faith rather than proven fact manifest into serious threats from a third of the world not sharing fully responsibility for critical issues such as over-population, environmental degradation and general long-term planetary sustainability.

 Personally I find the conventional Christian concept of salvation and crucification baffling. Was Christs sacrifice originally divine or necessary could such a love for humanity been demonstrated inspiringly yet in a less harsh, debt laden manner?

Unlike Christ with decisive foreknowledge of knowing where he came from and going Im didn't submit being born into a world of contradiction, confusion, injustice and chaos. I just want the opportunity to be accepted as an imperfect work in progress and live modestly in peace and harmony - Which should be an inherent birth-right for all things ...so is there a logical reason to be beholding or saved?

 If there be a divine entity he would not have the petty traits, egotism, subjugations, and inflexible technical judgments projected onto him by people, but qualities of compassionate commonality.

Regardless of orientation it would seem cultivating an open heart, mind, progressive nature and aspirational focus on whatever brings about the greatest possible harmony to all things without further expectation of reward the more essential integral qualifying, comprehensive, and purifying essence of spirituality and human potential.

Devastating Perfection: Many find reason to question the existence of an all-powerful God with so much suffering having occurred to the innocent throughout the ages. Was Jesus wondrously delusional in a beautiful way? Did his disciples pass on biases or exaggerate to have a personal sense of power, security and everlasting future or many thereafter delete, distort embellish to feel special, superior, exploit otherwise? Bearing in mind faith is just that; faith not fact, leaves one with the premise that if there is some kind of divine order then lifes primary purpose is to learn and evolve to interact harmoniously. Though there can be no doubt for those of progressive inclination living is a great character building, many experiences seem pointless and even cruel still there is hope: For just as its unreasonable to assume the existence of the divine, its also to conclude its non-existence, for as myself, many people around the world regardless of religion or otherwise have had similar miraculous experiences with a common thread with no other possible explanation other than being of divine origin (i.e. see oberf.org). Having exhausted logical explanations, could inexplicable chaos and confusion serve a greater purpose of purification of motive and goodness for its own sake in other words regardless of what the future may hold aspiring to whatever manifests the greatest harmony for all things and therefore our greater and truer salvation as a planet, race and individual?

Antidote for what may be a godless world: If we find transcendent beauty and compassion in ourselves and examples elsewhere then surely in the vastness of the universe are evolved worlds, dimensions and beings of empathy that have manifested such benevolent harmonious qualities sustainably.

Such certainty assures great possibilities here and beyond for beings throughout the cosmos of progressive inclination.",1428537600,,5705,5.634032634032634
8135988,4,B000H1RFFK,"I thought this had more content in the original version, 2 hours long, which I taped in 2005. Seeing that this was only 80 minutes I thought it was short but attributed it to cut commercials. I thought there was more on the artist's work, angels and also heaven, specifically Akiane, the amazing, and at that time, very young girl with her unbelievably wonderful visions and paintings of, heaven. and her atheist mother. So, I was disappointed she was either left out or possibly I remembered incorrectly...oh well... Still very informative, especially enjoyed the Dahli Llama.",1413590400,,577,5.020833333333333

This is a real interesting perspective on all world religions.
The last section covers real ordinary people who have had after death experiences.
They seem to have very common experiences after a peek in the afterlife.",1367798400,,237,4.95

8135995,3,B000H1RFFK,"I recently lost someone very close to me - and have been looking for reasurance of life after death. I have a hard time with 'faith' - I am more of a 'facts' kind of person. On one hand - I love this Barbara Walters Special, on the other - I think it could have gone deeper. I have seen this listed as being '2 hours' - but that is With commercials - on a DVD it comes in around an hour and 22 minutes. Too much time was wasted on terrorists - yes I suppose it belongs on here - but they don't deserve so much attention and I don't want to know more than basics on those killers. I think this should have been (or should be) a two part special - three hours long. I wish there was more focus on near death experiances - and other such factual people.
Personally - I couldn't have made a documentary as good as this - it takes lots of talent and time - still - I think more depth would have been nicer.
I have read 'Embraced by the light' - Very inspirational!! Listened to some Sylvia Browne audio CDs (Great!). I also bought a DVD from the History Channel - about Heaven - but is so much a waste - caught up on Who created what concepts - Not very inspirational for me.
Sincerely, Scott.",1343174400,,1188,4.0168776371308015
