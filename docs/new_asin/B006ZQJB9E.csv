8507177,5,B006ZQJB9E,"One of three titles in the series --- see MY [latest] reviews --- to inform and entertain.

These titles, though expensive for videos, are better thought of as ""College in a box"" if SFX
is of A=N=Y interest to you.

I am wearing a Green Frankenstein' Monster mask in my Amazon Profile Photo. Obviously, it AIN'T
g-r-e-e-n... I think ""The monster"" looks better BLUE. I have some technicolor out-take footage of
Boris Karlof as the monster -- and HE is light BLUE. However, Boris Karloff was ONLY as tall as my
MOTHER, and his version of the monster (he even removed his partial plates to appear more shallow-
cheeked) ISN'T my ideal of THE MONSTER... the 6'4"" Glenn Strange version is MY favorite. Glenn
Strange --- like Boris --- played the monster three times [if you exclude the ROUTE 66 TV-episode].
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, anyway, I changed my mask from green to blue... without the expertise of these three
DVDs. I've worn my mask --- to pose for photographs --- in my 4.5"" Harley Davidson boots ---
making me (like Glenn Strange) seven-feet-tall, all suited-up!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Buy a good Hallowe'en mask before JULY ---- before the prices go up. Get one of these videos,
or all three, and fix your mask up. Never grow up! I'm 64. Have a Hauntingly good Hallowe'en!",1364342400,2,1442,5.515837104072398
