1640600,2,B00005O6OO,"This product advertises that it is for children, but the commentator talks through most of the excerpts, and my children (3 different classes) found it boring.",1140739200,5,159,5.153846153846154
1640601,2,B00005O6OO,"I was terribly disappointed with this DVD. The singing and staging is barely adequate, the picture, sound quality, and sound direction are all second rate. Some of the arias were cut off prematurely and the transitions into the next scene were poorly done. If your intention is to introduce young people to the story, buy one of the highly recommended DVD's and do your own commentary.",1123200000,8,385,4.848484848484849
7948433,5,B00005O6OO,"This production went over very well with my music students in grades K-5, way better than I expected it would! The special effects are totally not believable, but the students did not care. How silly of me to think this might matter. The older students were able to make connections between this version of ""The Heroic Journey"" and others they were already familiar with from Disney.",1469404800,2,383,4.818181818181818

7948435,5,B00005O6OO,I show this every year to my 5th grade general music classes and they love it. It's just enough to give them the feeling of a real opera without bogging down in the heavy opera stuff. I usually show half of it during one class and finish the next. I'm always pleased that they can review the story so far including the voice types for each character.,1464220800,2,350,4.2388059701492535

7948437,5,B00005O6OO,"I can see what the other reviewers are saying about this DVDs weaknesses, but I am giving it 5 starts because my two kids (4-almost-5 and 2-almost-3) really love it.  The first time they watched it I had to keep pausing it to answer questions but they really found it very gripping.  My son was on the edge of his seat and it had just the right amount of intrigue to keep him excited but not scared.  Now that they've been introduced to it I'm going to follow up by getting the fairy tale book version by Kyra Teis and a full length DVD.",1238976000,,537,4.144230769230769
7948438,1,B00005O6OO,"I purchased this video to supplement a composer lesson about Mozart.  The video is an abridged version of the Mozart opera, The Magic Flute.  I was disappointed by the poor video quality and poor production values.  One of the reasons I purchased an abridged version is that the full opera would be much to lengthy for elementary school audiences and I thought I would be able to show this in its entirity due to its abbreviated length, but the video is so poor, it failed to capture even my interest as an ADULT with two music degrees (one in vocal music performance, no less).  I DO NOT recommend this video.  It is useful to be shown in short excerpts only.  It is definitely not worth using the precious little funds you may already receive for equipment/supplies.",1186099200,17,768,4.610294117647059
7948439,5,B00005O6OO,"After reading the reviews here, I rented a copy from Netflix. My 4 year old son was entranced, despite the opera being in German. When he started walking around the house singing the Queen of the Night's aria, I ordered our own copy.

While I agree that it is not the best it could be, my son loves opera and wants to learn more. That, to me, is one of the best justifications for buying it. He loves the other Classical Kids CDs as well.",1184803200,,438,4.152941176470589
7948440,2,B00005O6OO,This was sold as a recommendation for children.  It was performed in German(?).  While it did have a English narrator a child couldn't follow it.,1183852800,,145,4.76
7948441,5,B00005O6OO,"It was not what i thought it would be. I was looking for something from ""Classical Kids"". That is my mistake.",1167868800,2,109,4.238095238095238
7948442,1,B00005O6OO,"I found this version at the library and decided to check it out. I was amazed at how bad it was. For one thing, they changed the story around which was bothersome. The singing is really bad, and I think the thing that that bothered me the most is the strange costumes (Tamino looks like an elf!) I also hated all the strange creatures that come out, instead of animals coming out when Tamino plays his flute, they have people prancing out on stage dressed as who knows what. The whole thing was just horrible, costumes, the set, everything...and a lot of times when the commentator is explaining a certain part, it'll be playing a whole different aria (or the wrong part of the aria.) The whole thing is so chopped up, and the DVD is more blurry and grainy than I've ever seen anything on DVD before. I wouldn't buy it or even waste yout time getting it from the library. You're better off buying a REAL production on DVD of the Magic Flute for your kids, such as the one at the Met with Kathleen Battle.",1144022400,21,1004,4.345744680851064
