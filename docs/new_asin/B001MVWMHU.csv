3700563,2,B001MVWMHU,"With the exception of the splinter, Giant squidward, and Life in the day, these episodes are either not really funny or they are terrible.  The big one was possibly the worst episode that I have ever seen in Spongebob, even though I'm a big fan.  Please, don't buy this.",1307923200,3,270,4.489795918367347
3700564,5,B001MVWMHU,"I'll admit it, I love Spongebob. This series has been the funniest since Looney Toons. While there are a few obvious clinkers there are more than a few gems to make up for it. ""The Big One"" was a classic in the making. Jonny Depp as JKL was a gem of a character. ""The Splinter"" made me cringe just a little, but it was still funny. I loved both ""Life in the Day"" and ""Sun Bleached"" I did find ""Slide Whistle Stooges"" a bit annoying and I couldn't help feeling sorry for Squidward just a little. All in all, this was a better offering.",1279152000,3,534,4.144230769230769
3700565,1,B001MVWMHU,"This was some of the worst episodes I've ever seen.  The first was the best on the DVD, but the rest are going way downhill.  To make a good point in fact, there was at least 2 times that they went to a ""Family Guy style cut-scene"" where they go totally off topic with some live action and totally pathetic joke about old people drinking sports drinks.  Apparently the writers are out of material, or simply don't care enough anymore, and are resorting to ripping of Family guy and other adult cartoons.  The voice of Spongebob is even becoming more deep and angry, because it isn't about fun anymore, it's about cramming already used humor down our throats.

Spongebob was famous for being innocent and fun with subtle adult humor tucked in.  Now the adult humor is being shoved down our throats, and I'm not sure why a child would even enjoy it anymore.  It's harsh, it's obnoxious, and the jokes are getting really lame. After the 4th season, the writers got enough money to just start throwing anything at us expecting to get paid anyways.  I'm returning this DVD, and I'll never buy another one until they get back to what made this cartoon so enjoyable for any age.  I won't buy anything spongebob related because the New episodes are ruining all the old ones for me.  Spongebob was unique, and now they just want to jump on the bandwagon of any other cartoon.  Southpark, Family Guy, and so forth are enjoyable because they don't have lines to cross.  That's there appeal, and it can only work for them.  Spongebob was suppose to go close enough to make it funny, and it felt good watching it, reminding you of your own childhood a bit.

So No, I don't suggest you buy it, because the writers have lost all the love and skill they used to put into it.  You might as well download the first episode somewhere like iTunes, but don't waste your money on the whole DVD.",1239321600,5,1872,4.480825958702065
3700566,5,B001MVWMHU,"My sister-in-law thinks I'm crazy to invite Spongebob into our lives.  She thinks he's low brow and will have a bad influence on the kids.  I say, if Spongebob is wrong,  I don't want to be right. And I've spent time with her kids.  They are humorless little drones.  I'll take a subversive dose of Spongebob if it means my kids turn out to be entertaining people.  And since we're a surfing family, we had to purchase this movie.  We are now ready to tackle the Big One ourselves!  This DVD does not disappoint.  But when does Spongebob ever?",1237852800,,543,4.404040404040404
3700567,4,B001MVWMHU,"I rented this DVD and surprisingly, most of the episodes are very good. The first episode stars Johnny Depp as surf guru Jack Kahuna Laguna. This episode is one of the best double length SpongeBob episodes out there. It is a lot better than the episodes ""Whatever Happened To SpongeBob?"", ""Have You Seen This Snail"", and ""The Sponge Who Could Fly"". We even have a live-action guest appearence of the singer Davy Jones.

While it may be better to wait for these episodes to come out on a season box set, if you want a good DVD this one is it. Below is the episodes that are contained on this DVD.

1. SpongeBob Vs. The Big One (Great episode, hopefully Jack Kahuna Laguna returns in future episodes with Jonny Depp reprising his role.)
2. A Life in a Day (not bad, better than some other episodes)
3. Sun Bleached (reminds me of the time I got really burnt in the sun at Ocean City, Maryland)
4. Giant Squidward (a good one)
5. No Nose Knows (utterly stupid)
6. Patty Caper (another good one)
7. Plankton's Regular (ok, lingers between a good or bad episode)

While not all the episodes are great, most are worth watching at least once. Buy now and enjoy!",1236384000,2,1154,4.433962264150943
3700568,3,B001MVWMHU,"I bought this dvd today and I was somewhat dissapointed.

First of all, my most favorite episode of all time, ""The Splinter"", isn't even on the dvd as listed on this site. Neither is ""Slide Whistle Stooges"".

That means Amazon.com posted the wrong episode list.

The correct episode list is:

-Spongebob vs. The Big One
-A Life in a Day
-Sun Bleached
-Giant Squidward
-No Nose Knows
-Patty Caper
-Plankton's Regular

These episodes are on TV all the time, unlike ""The Splinter"", so it's kind of a waste. And when ""The Big One"" premiers on TV it'll be on all the time too.

It also has some special features including:

-Plankton's Special Sinister Commentary
-""Ridin' the Hook"" Music Video
-Full Screen Format
-Doldy Digital
-English Stereo

I haven't bothered with any of them because they don't look worth it.

To sum it up, ""Spongebob Vs. The Big One"" DVD is at least okay, and seriously think about it before buying it, because it's a bit of a waste of money.",1236297600,10,963,4.617647058823529
3700569,5,B001MVWMHU,"This DVD contains my favorite episodes: SpongeBob vs. The Big One, The Splinter, Slide Whistle Stooges, A Life in a Day, Sun Bleached, and Giant Squidward. I haven't seen ""Spongebob vs. The Big One"" or ""Slide Whistle Stooges"", but ""The Splinter"", ""A Life in a day"", ""Sun Bleached"", and ""Giant Squidward"" are my fav eps! When this DVD comes out i'm gonna buy it!

Here's the episode descripitions of each episode:

* SpongeBob vs. The Big One - SpongeBob and his friends are suddenly swept away out of Bikini Bottom after a big wave hits. Now to get back home, SpongeBob and his friends must ride the big wave. Guest starring Johnny Depp as Jack Kahuna Laguna.

* A Life in the Day - After Larry publicy humiliates Spongebob and Patrick on the beach claiming they never do anything dangerous, Patrick takes up daredevil stunts so he can be ""living like Larry"". But will his stunts get him hurt, or worse?!

* The Splinter - This episode is very similar to the Season 1 episode ""Suds"". After Spongebob gets a splinter in his finger, he's afraid to tell Mr. Krabs because of the ""If a worker is injured, he goes home"" policy. So he asks Patrick to remove it, but Patrick only makes it worse.

* Sun Bleached - Spongebob and Patrick try to get tans so they'll be invited to a beach party, but when Spongebob stays under the tanning booth too long, he becomes ""sun bleached"".

* Giant Squidward - After Spongebob and Patrick spray Squidward with ""growth spray"", he becomes 50 feet tall. And the Bikini Bottom residents fear him thinking he's a ""monster"".

* Slide Whistle Stooges (unaired episode) - SpongeBob and Patrick get new slide whistles and keep playing them, much to the annoyance of Squidward. He is getting so annoyed of it until he buys one and begins to like the toy himself.",1231027200,18,1783,4.570532915360501

My daughter is perfectly healthy now, thank goodness!  But, this movie happened to be in her hospital room.  The central character - the quintessential surfer ""god"" - is absolutely hilarious!  I actually can't believe I bought the movie, but I wanted to see again this funny movie that brought laughter into somewhat of a scary time!",1364256000,2,494,4.64367816091954
