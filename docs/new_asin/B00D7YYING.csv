8590502,5,B00D7YYING,"This is my first DVD from Mr. Janich and must say that I enjoyed watching and listening to his instructions. He is very clear and practical with his approach making it easy to practice what he demonstrates. As he stated, this is a tactical pen training and it's all about tactics ( drill training). I got a tactical pen and will be starting my drills and practice soon, incorporating this to my regular combat training. I will obtain other DVDs from this instructor. Highly recommend this.",1388793600,4,489,4.6976744186046515
