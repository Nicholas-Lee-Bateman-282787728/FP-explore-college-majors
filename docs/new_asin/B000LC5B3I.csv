2705543,2,B000LC5B3I,"I was very disappointed, I thought I'd be getting a detailed account of the night April 3,1968 and events leading up to that night and that incredible speech but instead the film basically was fragmented clips of Dr. Kings life and the quality of the film was poor, if you own ""Citizen King"" a PBS Documentary which I do, then this is an unnecessary purchase. Therewas not enough elaboration on this speech and the circumstances surrounding it.",1209945600,21,444,4.779220779220779

8161498,2,B000LC5B3I,I was disapointed in this dvd because there was no narration and no one speaking at all.  This dvd only showed raw footage of the civil rights movement.,1325116800,3,152,4.428571428571429
8161499,2,B000LC5B3I,"This item was really not what I had expected.  The ""Eyes on the prize"" chapter ""The Promised Land"" is the best look I've seen on the Memphis speech and the events surrounding it, but ""Citizen King"" and the History Channel's ""King"" also do a good job.",1319328000,3,250,4.434782608695652
