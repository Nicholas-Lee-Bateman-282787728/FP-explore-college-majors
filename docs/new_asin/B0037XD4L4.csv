Good explanation of what she does as she's painting...just wish the steps were presented more slowly so I could follow along easily...maybe that's just me...hoping if I watch several more times, it will sink in!",1428019200,,275,4.978260869565218
8390840,5,B0037XD4L4,"As I have said in other reviews of Hazel Soan's dvds or books, she is very good at what she does, is an excellent teacher, gives several composition examples as well as techniques for application.  Always a pleasure to watch her paint and instruct.  I have all her books and continue to look forward to new publications and dvds.",1389225600,5,329,4.559322033898305
