Before I even start, a word of advice to men. If a woman is telling you theres no need to fear, she won't eat you?

Shes probably going to eat you.

This modernized, sexified, Little Mermaid with a horror twist comes to us from Polish* director Agnieszka Smoczyska originally titled C&oacute;rki Dancingu, literally Daughters of the Dance Club. After a Christmas 2015 release, C&oacute;rki Dancingu went on to win the 2016 Special Jury Award for Unique Vision and Design at Sundance, as well as Best Film at Fantasporto 2016 before finally gracing us heathens in the USA with a February 2017 release.

The Lure begins as so many love stories do. With two siren sisters enticing a poor man into the dark sea, by promising they won't eat him. However the human song may hold just as much allure, as the song of the of a young musician calls them onto land. The two sisters, Golden (Michalina Olszaska) and Silver (Marta Mazurek), take human form and emerge from the watery depths. In their natural habitat, their bottom halves are quite magnificent, slimy tails. When dry, theyve got legs. Hot legs. Identical to any other strong independent stripper except for their complete lack of genitalia. Their unnatural Barbie doll smoothness does not hinder them from quickly finding work as a novelty act at the very same flashy strip club that the object of their affection played by Jakub Girszal, plays bass.

After a successful audition with the sleazy nightclub proprietor (Zygmunt Malanowicz), the girls are taken under the wing of the chainsmoking aging cabaret singer played by Kinga Preis.  The film follows the sisters musical adventure on land through a shopping mall makeover number, to their topless mermaid performances while lounging in a giant champagne glass filled with water. Between the flashy song and dance numbers that make them the stars of the nightlife scene, Golden and Silver navigate their cross species sexual coming of age. Hopelessly in love with the handsome bass player, Silver looks to overcome complications arising from a lack of genitals. Golden wrestles with her own kind of urges as both sisters struggle to remain in human form and not succumb to their animalistic nature, especially their blood sucking and flesh eating urges. Despite their efforts, we find that hangry has a slightly more sinister implication when your meal of choice is human. But don't worry, I won't spoil it for you.

A whimsically twisted take on a familiar fairytale, The Lure makes up for the occasional lack of coherence with its neon sequined nightlife setting, mischievously joyful musical numbers, and imaginative choreography.

Choreographer Kaya Kolodziejczyk & Jaroslaw Staniek
Musical numbers: written by Barbara and Zuzanna Wronska of the Polish band Ballady i Romanse.

Does blood do the same thing to mermaids as water? if they get splattered with blood are they going to sprout a tail?

Ooo, and do Americans taste different from the Polish?

7739894,5,B01ETAYIPY,"Ill admit Im a sucker for a mermaid movie, and so when I found out about The Lure, I simply had to see it. When I learned that not only was it a mermaid movie, it was also a musical and somewhat of a horror film, I was even more intrigued.

The plot is a retelling of the Hans Christian Andersen story The Little Mermaid, set in 80s Poland. I don't speak a word of Polish, but subtitles never bothered me anyway. The major difference between this film and the source material is that instead of one mermaid, there are two sisters who go ashore in search of something. One for love, and the other for fun and apparently the occasional hot meal. Its pretty obvious how everything will play out but its still compelling to watch. The ending is bittersweet but a vast improvement on the HCA story, if like me you agree that any guy who flippantly casts aside a mermaids love deserves whats coming to him.

As for the music, its so catchy I bought the soundtrack. Once again, I don't speak a word of Polish but that hasn't stopped me from caterwauling along, much to the delight of my neighbors.

I have recommended this movie only to my friends who have an attention span longer than the average superhero movie worshipping filmgoer. It won't be everyones cup of tea, but if you're a fan of the unusual or you just want to see some of the creepiest mermaid tails ever put on screen, its definitely worth a look.",1518220800,7,1407,4.362595419847328
7739895,2,B01ETAYIPY,"I think that this movie tried too hard to be a little bit of every genre. The musical part was lame; it was truly not a musical and musicality was not appeasing. It tried to be sexy: it was only nudity over nudity, yet the nudity did not really add much to the plot. It tried to be a science fiction, and I will give you that, the topic is awesome and magically dark. Because of the unnecessities, mainly the musical, the dark lure of the movie did not fully develop.",1517443200,,467,4.142857142857143
7739896,5,B01ETAYIPY,So wonderfully quirky!  How can you not love an Eastern European club-scene musical about flesh eating mermaids?  The best unheard of cinema surprise I've had in at least a year!,1517443200,,178,4.9
7739897,3,B01ETAYIPY,"Two mermaid sisters (whose names are Gold and Silver) are drawn to the shore by the siren song of a nightclub trio singing on a beach. The sisters sing their own siren song to get noticed and taken to land. After an interview with the nightclub owner (which includes the revelation that they are mermaids and will grow long, luscious tails when they get wet), the sisters become part of the act. The story is set in 1980s Poland and the club is a bit trashy--a lot of the acts involve stripping or otherwise exploiting the talent for the benefit of the patrons. There's sex in the bathrooms. Anyone can get a smoke or a drink, including the probably underaged sisters. Nevertheless, they enjoy what they think is a glamorous life and Silver falls for the trio's guitarist. That spells trouble for a number of reasons. If she gets the tail-to-legs operation, she'll lose her voice (just like in The Little Mermaid, a clear jumping off point for this film). Also, if he falls in love with someone else, she'll turn to sea foam if she doesn't eat him before the next sunrise. Did I mention they are carnivorous mermaids? The tale has more dark themes beyond the squalor of the night club.

The musical numbers are not limited to the night club. The girls sing a tune as they shop for clothes; Silver has one during the surgical swap of her fish tail with another woman's lower half. A lot of the songs are rather bleak (even the upbeat ones aren't very catchy). The music has a lot of synthesizers, which goes well with the 1980s setting but isn't my favorite style of music. I'm not inspired to run out and get the soundtrack. The musical element is persistent but not strong.

The coming of age story is more like Ginger Snaps or The Company of Wolves, i.e. a more adult and horror-tinged look at female sexuality. The contrast between Silver's search for true love, with its inherent dangers of offering yourself to someone who may not reciprocate, and Gold's exploration of her sexuality, looking for a tantalizing experience or maybe her next meal, is interesting. Sensuality is fairly rampant in the movie. The movie has a lot of nudity (entirely female, by the way) and frank sexuality. Having two young females going through that journey of self discovery lets the filmmakers look at their sexuality in different ways without sacrificing plausibility.

Overall, I found the movie interesting but I don't know who I'd recommend it to. It has elements of a musical horror like Little Shop of Horrors and of a musical fairy tale like Into the Woods, but is much darker and less comedic than either. It's not a brilliant combination of music and storytelling as the film Once. The actors are endearing and the theme is explored in interesting ways. The movie defies easy categorization.",1516665600,2,2787,4.695296523517382
7739898,5,B01ETAYIPY,"I didn't want to like this film because of the ""musical"" aspect. It's just not my cup of tea. However, the more I tried not to like it as I watched it, the more I fell in love with it. Make no mistake. This is NOT the happy ever after little mermaid Disney sold us. This is based on the darker fairy tale fewer of us know. Vivid colors, gritty elements of the underbelly of life, and fantastic acting make this movie brilliant.

Mermaids, according to legend, are frightening and beautiful creatures. Depending on what mythology you explore, they are seen as monstrous, deceptive, seductive, cruel, and very very far from human. I was excited to see this portrayed in ""The Lure"". There is nothing held back here, and the rating is what it is for a very good reason.",1515715200,4,765,4.464285714285714

7739901,4,B01ETAYIPY,"This was an interesting film, while I would not call it a horror film. It does have some graphic scenes. But the film is more of a drama about life going up and feeling like a fish out of water.",1514160000,,194,3.875
7739902,5,B01ETAYIPY,"If you like trashy movies, this will be heaven for you, as it was for me.  (SPOILERS AHEAD!)  Not just a trashy Polish disco musical, it also includes vampire-ish killer mermaids, played by attractive young actresses who spend most of the movie topless, gratuitous sex, and fabulously tacky design.  The music is really fun--if you had a love-hate relationship with ABBA during the latter disco years of that group (did I just eliminate my entire reading audience with that question?), you will be amused and pleased.  The film seems pretty self-aware, so it's a bit hard (with the cultural differences involved) to discern just how tongue-in-cheek the whole thing is, but that's also part of the fun.  Highly recommended.  Just being able to describe the movie to friends (who will never watch it in a million years) was worth the rental price alone.",1514160000,2,851,4.916083916083916

7739905,5,B01ETAYIPY,"Erotic Polish pop musical about two mermaid sisters coping with human romance. I've never seen anything like it, yet it exquisitely feels so reminiscent of 2006-2007 European fantasy indie films. Movies that would possess bizarre concepts and eclectic settings yet never strayed from putting complete passion into the story.

With beautifully bright neon colors and murky blackened green set pieces, to the non sequitur-esque lyrics of the original songs, and the mesmerizing but dangerous beauty of the mermaid leads, The Lure is just my kind of strange mixed with creative honesty and uniquity. I need more bizarre yet honest musicals like The Lure and Repo: The Genetic Opera in my life.",1512000000,5,690,5.216216216216216

7739907,3,B01ETAYIPY,"First thing you should know is THIS IS A MUSICAL. Not that its bad, I just wasn't aware it was.

This film looks amazing. The production design and the cinematography are top notch. The performances are all great. I do wish certain scenes would play out as a traditional narrative rather than be rushed through via a song a dance. I find it hard to get fully invested when a song kicks in every few minutes. But if you like musicals I think you will like this. Stylistically its bonkers!",1511049600,2,487,4.411111111111111

7739909,2,B01ETAYIPY,Not sure what I expected.  Maybe an erotic horror movie. What I got was a hard to follow musical with poor music and ok special effects.  Camera work and lighting wasn't great.  Id suggest passing this one up.,1510358400,,209,4.447368421052632
7739910,3,B01ETAYIPY,"Storyline is a twist on the mermaid tale of coming out of the sea to walk on land.  The cinematography is excellent--made me stop to watch various scenes.  The music, songs, are excellent and I'd like to find them on a CD.  The subtitles are not my favorite way to go, but the artistry and production is worth watching, as well as the fine level of acting.  Lower rating due to subtitles and would have liked to see more unique aspects to the tale.",1509321600,,448,4.2976190476190474
7739911,4,B01ETAYIPY,An amazing movie and a very bold idea.  People (myself included) don't know the real story of The Little Mermaid.  Watch The Lure and find out as well as be entertained in the process!  I look forward to seeing more from this director.,1508544000,,235,4.4186046511627906
7739912,4,B01ETAYIPY,"The Lure is a fantasy horror musical that provides a darkly feminist twist on Hans Christian Andersens The Little Mermaid. On a moonlit night, carnivorous mermaid sisters Gold (Michalina Olszanska) and Silver (Marta Mazurek) emerge from the sea to the sound of a pop trio on the beach in 1980s Poland. Their tantalizing siren songs and otherworldly auras make them overnight sensations when they're hired by the proprietor of a disco/cabaret/strip joint (Zygmunt Malanowicz) who recognizes in them a novelty act that will bring in the bucks.

The film hovers in the netherworld between fantasy and reality, mixing choreographed numbers and romance. Silver falls for the house bands bass player (Jakub Gierszal), which threatens her relationship with her sister. Gold decides to pursue singing her siren song to attract unwitting victims so she can feast on them.

Director Agnieszka Smoczynska has crafted a one-of-a-kind motion picture. What starts as a fairy tale transforms into a rock musical horror flick, with things getting gruesome and bloody. The over-the-top audacity of the movie makes it worth seeing. A coming-of-age fairy tale with a catchy synthesizer-laced soundtrack, wild song-and-dance numbers, and gritty settings, it explores themes of emerging sexuality, exploitation, and the compromises of adulthood. Its not a cinematic classic by any means, but it is so bizarre, and so out there, that it has to be seen to be believed.

Bonus materials on the unrated widescreen Blu-ray release include a making-of-featurette containing interviews with director Agnieszka Smoczynska, actors Marta Mazurek and Michelin Olszanska, screenwriter Robert Bolesto and other crew members; deleted scenes; Aria Diva (2007) and Viva Maria! (2010), short films by Smoczynska; trailer; and a critical essay. The film is in Polish, with English subtitles.",1507766400,14,1852,5.514084507042254

I understand Polish and odd things were changed. Dedal is Daedelus not Trident. The translator also had weird slang choices that don't fit. That is the risk with any localization of course and the important aspects remain though people, there aren't VAMPIRES in this as you may have seen. Just Sirens. Mermaids by another name.

  It was worth the cost to watch it once in HD , but probably will not buy it or watch it again.

If you just watch the film, you see. . . a fine thing. Adolescent female sexuality, with all of its alienation from one's own body, the fear and thrill of sexual power and sexual vulnerability, retold as a mermaid. A girl is a mermaid: her body is half fish, half Other, and she is desired/desiring, but with an awful sacrifice of the selfhood. And yet this metaphor is wasted, because that isn't what the movie does. The movie is the autobiography of two women who grew up in the last days of ""Communist"" Poland and its strip clubs/discos. Therefore, its nostalgia, its picaresque of children being innocently backstage while degradation takes place, and its interruptions of domestic violence and alcoholism just. . . intrude. The result is incoherent, ineffective, and something like a topless Cabaret mixed with Hans Christian Andersen.",1522368000,,1045,4.876404494382022
