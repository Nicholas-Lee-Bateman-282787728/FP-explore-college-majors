8365042,4,B002DCAG48,i really like watching jaun diaz fights! He is like a lightweight mike tyson! hated to see him lose in this fight against marquez.it is a great fight while it lasts. a nice tribute and a few old black and white fights from the 60s of jose torres.a great fight between rocky juarez and marco antonio barrera. these grandes peleas dvds are a hidden jewel for any fight fan.,1333152000,,371,4.391304347826087
