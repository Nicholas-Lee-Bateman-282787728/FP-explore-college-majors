8653326,5,B00JQJ92FU,"I have not read the book, but this movie is 5 stars.  The acting is great--helped by a very well crafted script that weaves present with past.  Memories are a very important part of the story line, so pay attention.

Fun romance.",1459296000,2,229,4.404761904761905
8653327,5,B00JQJ92FU,"Really excellent movie.  The acting is great.  There are probably some cultural things that make the nature of the old women with the cats nature, obvious to someone from the Japanese culture.",1433721600,2,192,4.96875
8653328,5,B00JQJ92FU,Love this movie and basically anything related to Arashi. Matsu-Jun was so meek in this movie and Ueno Juri was as cute as a button. The preview really does sell the movie. A cute romance for sure!,1418169600,3,197,4.351351351351352
