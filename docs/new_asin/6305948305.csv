7899357,5,6305948305,"""Ed Wood Look Back in Angora"" is an extra on this DVD.
A very rare/cool documentary from the gang at Rhino.",1413936000,,107,4.142857142857143
7899358,4,6305948305,"Ed Wood was certainly a character. That he got so many people to go along with his wacky novel ideas for films is amazing in its own right. Not that these were famous or beautiful people, but that there were so many screwballs floating around and he seemed to find most of them.",1402444800,,278,4.264150943396227
7899359,2,6305948305,im a big ED WOOD fan. if I where you just stick to his famous 50's b-movie films cult classics.,1370131200,,95,3.8
7899360,5,6305948305,"First, the description of this DVD on this Web page is incorrect: Wood neither wrote or directed this, nor was it the last film he directed.

Second, aside from Glen or Glenda, this is one of our rare instances to see our pal Eddie act in a featured role as opposed to a cameo or small role.  He's actually quite funny in this film, especially in the beginning; I am reminded of his role as Pops in Fugitive Girls (1974).  (His other role in The Fugitive Girls shows his diversity as an actor.)  The size of Mr. Murphy's underpants in Pretty Models is rather funny, too!  We also see him humiliated in drag, his second of four roles in which he crossdresses.

Something Weird Video released a version of this film that was edited (as a companion to their X-rated version of Necromania on VHS).  This is the full-length production.

I recommend this film for people comfortable with the sleazy side of Wood.  That is, the era of his work that would have come after that depicted in Tim Burton's film Ed Wood, when Eddie primarily worked on smutty pulp and rarely had a chance to work with or on film anymore.

The double-sided disc also features the Wood documentary Look Back in Angora from 1994.",1241568000,6,1196,4.49537037037037
7899361,1,6305948305,"I've developed an interest in the movies of Ed Wood of late. They are so poorly done that they tend to be funny. When I learned of this Ed Wood movie that I didn't have, I ordered it. That was a mistake. It seems that the movies is nothing more than an excuse to get girls to strip.

The premise is that he invites models over for ""auditions"" he then gets them to strip in order to evaluate his new line of see through clothing. Through the day, more and more show up until the orgy gets into full swing. There is no more story to it than that. At least there was no more story that I was able to sit through.

At one time, I did not believe that there was a more boring or worse movie than GLEN OR GLENDA. I was wrong. This one is.

I you want soft core porn, I am sure there are better productions out there. If you want a movie for entertainment, this isn't it.

If 0 stars had been a choice, I would have taken it, unless there was something lower.",1118361600,,952,3.968586387434555
7899362,2,6305948305,"I bought this DVD because I heard so much about Ed Wood and his classics such as ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" but was disappointed.
The plot, if you can call it that, involves the slightly scary character played by Ed Wood, himself, inviting models to his house where they all end up gettin' naked.  Might sound good to some but this has to be seen to be believed (and that's not a recommendation!).
Summary: Hire it but don't buy it.",1033430400,4,431,4.320987654320987
7899363,5,6305948305,"Pretty Models All In A Row is the DVD release of the exploitation classic The Love Feast by Ed D Wood Jr. Rhino has done an admirable job presenting this film (extra features include a documentary about Wood and an incredibly fast scrolling but thorough filmography) but this film is something best left for true Wood fans only. Those not familiar with his films can expect things like bizarre stream of conscienceness dialogue, bad acting, terrible continuity, and very graphic full nudity (this is NOT a hardcore porno...). Well if you read this far I'm sure you want to see it now, so I'll explain the deep and thought provoking story line. A horny old man (Wood) calls up various modeling agencies posing as a photographer so he can lure young women to his house and get them in bed, however his plans backfire when some past victims show up seeking revenge. I strongly reccomend this film to fans(and freaks), but outsiders beware!",998006400,21,936,4.748466257668712
