8059276,3,B0009E325W,"A nice documentary for those who are looking for a quick look at the history of Edwards AFB.  For anyone that has followed the amazing events that have marked the development of aviation research at this facility, this video is simply too short and just touches the surface.  Edwards AFB has been the focus of aviation innovation for over 60 years.  And its contributions to space exploration are unfortunately not well known.  This documentary has some nice video and is a pleasant enough way to spend an hour but, to be candid, the subject deserves more time and a deeper, more detailed view of the subject.",1432512000,,609,4.716981132075472
