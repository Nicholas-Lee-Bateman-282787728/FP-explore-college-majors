1632200,1,B00005NFYY,"I'm a true fan of the first Leprechaun movie.  Warwick Davis and Jennifer Aniston really make this film great.  The humor interlaced with the story is hilarious.  A true cult classic.  Obviously filmed on a limited budget, the characters are written with some decent depth.  As much depth as would be expected anyways.  Believing that the sequels would be worth the cost of buying the boxed set, I purchased them.  Sadly mistaken, I wasted my money.  2-5 are some of the worst written movies I've ever seen.  Not to mention you don't recognize a single actor until Part 5 where Ice-T and Coolio come into play.  They're ...not worth buying.  Buy the original.  Love it, watch it often.  Rent the rest.  And be glad you saved your money.",1016496000,2,736,4.6484375
1632201,4,B00005NFYY,"The Leprechaun series is not what it appears to be. The pint-sized Irish antagonist doesn't go around chasing scantily-clad babysitters with garden implements for 87 minutes, but instead pursues an endless quest to ""find me gold!"" and deliver dozens of some of the funniest and most quotable lines I remember hearing in one franchise (e.g. ""By the luck of the Irish!"" ""I want me gold!"" ""Try as you will and try as ye might, who steals me gold won't live through the night!"") In fact, it baffles me as to why this series of films never made it to cult classic status.
LEPRECHAUN: In my opinion the best constructed and funniest in the series, this film stars the hot-hot-hot Jennifer Aniston as a valley girl who pisses off our Irish leprechaun friend. A lot of fun and great if you have a real warped sense of humor.
LEPRECHAUN 2: The weakest in the series, this involves the Leprechaun tracking down the descendant of his old girlfriend from 300 years ago to modern-day California. One of the few highlights is the Leprechaun's new wheels: a mini-race car with decals of four-leafed clovers X'ed out and ""I WANT ME GOLD"" written all over it.
LEPRECHAUN 3: Hillarious and gory good fun, this one finds an unlucky Las Vegas gambler stumbling upon one of the Leprechaun's gold coins. Probably the sickest humor of the batch. That's a good thing hehehe.
LEPRECHAUN 4-In Space: This can be a little cheesy. Okay REALLY cheesy. But it does manage to entertain, which is the main concept of the series. It's a fast-paced sci-fi actioner which involves really bad CGI effects of spaceships, Space Marines, shootouts, human tarantulas (don't ask), topless extra-terrestrial princesses, and a bunch of other crazy [stuff]. Don't worry. You'll have fun.
LEPRECHAUN IN THE HOOD: Okay. I admit it. I haven't seen this one. But that'll give you something to look forward to when you buy the box set.",1015632000,9,1886,4.788343558282208
1632202,5,B00005NFYY,"All five of these movies were pure genius. The reviews arn't that good but the movies are inventive, funny(sometimes even intellecual humor), and down right terrifing.

1632204,2,B00005NFYY,"The Leprechaun series on dvd. Includes Leprechaun, Leprechaun 2, Leprachaun 3, Lepreachaun 4: In Space, and Leprechaun in the hood. I don't like the stupid first installment. In it, the leprachaun terroizises a group of people after one of his coins is taken. In the second one, He trys to find a love intrest. Leprachaun 3 has him visit Las Vagas to reclaim more of his coins. Leprechaun in space is pretty self explainatory. Leprachaun in the hood, leprachaun the rapper? Not exactly a great collection, but you've got to watch them sometime.",997747200,5,544,4.860215053763441
1632253,5,B00005NFYY,"Saw this in the theatre (it was the second and final Lep movie to be released theatrically before going straight to video). It's simply so-bad-it's-good and I think one of the strongest films in the Lep franchise; Sandy Baron's Bukowski-esque performance steals the show. The plot involves the Leprechaun, only able to take a bride once every 1,000 years, on a quest to get himself murried. In this case his dating pool is in the early 1990s Los Angeles. A very solid entry in the horror-comedy genre, though it's pretty bad in both those categories. Yet, as I said, so bad it's good. Whereas some of the other Lep films are just so bad they're bad, this one is worthwhile, as the franchise was still finding itself, and a low-budget charm characterizes the experience. Watch for the topless stunt double, the dude who plies the lead female character with chili dogs, and some very obviously drawn-on facial hair on the Lep's slave.",1501718400,,932,4.7592592592592595

The first two are awesome. 3 is awesome in Las Vegas and in Space is cheesey fun. The other 2 in the hood movies are awesome too. Leprechaun is a underappreciated and overlooked horror Franchise.

1632424,3,B00005NFYY,"This sequel makes me miss the rigid acting in Leprechaun (1993). Although Warwick Davis remains forever a pleasure on screen, his surroundings, supporting cast and writing have collapsed around him like a straw house!

We begin in Ireland 1000 years ago, as our Leprechaun (Warwick Davis) celebrates his 1000th birthday on which he may magically choose his bride by saying ""God bless you"" after she sneezes thrice.  Stupidest ritual ever!!!!  But his marital prophecy is foiled and he curses that on his yet next 1000th birthday he'll marry her fairest offspring.  Barf!  This sounds awful.  And why is he dressed like a green wizard!?!

So here we are on St. Patrick's Day 1994, his 2000th birthday, and the mythological wee person emerges from a tree in Hollywood, California. To preempt your question, I have no clue whatsoever why he was in that tree or for how long or how he got across the Atlantic Ocean.  Perhaps he teleported--as we learned he can do in part 1 when he has his gold and, thus, his powers.  But waitdidn't we last leave him dead in a well in South Dakota????

I'm left to wonder how this creature of Irish folklore emerged from this tree in 1994 when, in 1993, we last saw him melting to death after a kid slingshot a four-leaf clover down his throat.  Remember that?  Because evidently it slipped director Rodman Flender's (The Unborn, Idle Hands) mind.""

A lot seemed to slip his mind.  Like when the Leprechaun refers to St. Patrick's ""feast day"" on his 1000th birthday in the year 994which predates it being known as a feast day by about 700 years! Moreover, if his 2000th birthday is in 1994 then this Leprechaun was born in the year 7 BC (and not 6 BC, since there is no year zero), 401 years BEFORE Saint Patrick (AD 365-461) was even alive and before some pretty important Christian stuff happened regarded naming saints and all that jazz!  So not only are the writer and director rather uninformed Christians (and historians), but they also seem to have made a ""part 2"" that behaves as if ""part 1"" never happened.

What's more is that the practice of saying ""God bless you"" in response to a sneeze is not recorded prior to the year 77 AD. However it's expected to predate the earliest recorded (or ""written"") history, so we'll let that one slide.  But hold on, according to the Irish Folk story ""Master and Man"" by Thomas Crofton Croker one of the purposes of saying ""God bless you"" is to serve as a shield against evil.  Other variations are to protect the sneezer from momentary vulnerability to the Devil as the soul can escape during a sneeze, or that the sneeze itself is an effort to expel the evil (this Wikipedia article explains some of it).  It seems that no matter which historical variant of the phrase we choose, it makes absolutely no sense for the Leprechaun to say this to complete a prophecy in which an innocent virgin's soul is forever claimed against her will by an evil Leprechaun.

Well, in either case the Leprechaun's back and in control of his pot of gold.  And now, why ISN'T he dressed as a wizard?!?  Not that he ever should have been, but CONSISTENCY, people!

His magic permits him to control prehensile tree roots, cause hallucinations, and manifest telekinesis.  At one point he uses his powers of illusion to make a horny teenager think an exposed lawnmower blade was a pair of bare breasts so that when he goes in for a motorboat he got the wrong kind of motor in his face!  Unfortunately the kill occurs off-camera, thus highlighting the destitute budget--which accordingly reflects all other aspects of this film's production value.  But there was one entertaining on-screen kill when a snippety barista (Michael McDonald; Mad TV) gets steamed to death with a bloody blistered face.

The Leprechaun finally claims his bride in magical bondage (via three prophesied sneezes and a ""blessing"") and takes her home to his tree in Hollywood.  Yep.  Evidently he has lived there for a while, creating yet more discontinuity with Part 1.  His lair is a labyrinthine subterranean Hobbit hole.  He just needs to reclaim a gold shilling before he can consummate the marriage.  And things get festive when retrieving his gold is literally down by removing it from someone's stomach.

Doing away with four leaf clovers and shoe-shining compulsions, the movie crescendos into a lackluster finale culminating in an explosion when the Leprechaun is defeated by his ancient weakness, wrought iron.  His explosive death pales in comparison to his melting scene in Part 1 and after our protagonists escape his lair the movie ""just ends.""  Watch out for a cameo by MTV Lifetime Achievement Award Winner Clint Howard (Lords of Salem).  While this movie has its bad movie delights here and there, recognizing Clint might just be one of the more satisfying highlights for you.",1460505600,2,4822,4.774427020506635

Oh wait two outfits for her, lol.  The following movies take the feel and attitude of our little Leprechaun friend to other places but bring the same character and stupidity that you will learn to love as this becomes a classic series in  your heart, like freddy and jason.

1632852,3,B00005NFYY,"If you are looking for stupid fun, then this is a must have. This set contains all of the Warwick Davis ""Leprechaun"" titles. I will say that while none of the films are very good, not are unwatchable....well, the 2nd ""Hood"" film come close, but with enough adult beverage at hand, even that is entertaining.

""Leprechaun"" - I guess you would consider this the high point of the series if you're looking for ""horror"". While there is still plenty of absurd laughs, they still try to insert some chills here and there. An old farmer returns home from Ireland toting a pot of gold he took from a Leprechaun. Unfortunately the little murderous troll followed him home to get his gold back. This one is probably most famous for starring a pre-""Friends"" Jennifer Anniston.

""Leprechaun 2"" - This time out the little green psycho is chasing after one of his missing gold coins that is in the possession of a street magician and his girlfriend. Clint Howard stops by for a quick cameo. And the jokes are amped up a bit more with the Leprechaun spouting off a ton of dirty limericks and jokes.

""Leprechaun 3"" - A college student on his way to school in California decides to swing through Vegas to take a look at sin city. There he picks up a showgirl and one of the Leprechaun's gold coins. This one feels ultra low Bridget, but there are some chuckles here and there.

""Leprechaun in Space"" - This time out the Leprechaun takes on a platoon of Space Marines after they take his gold and his princess. This one is so insanely dumb you can't help but watch it with a smile on you face. If nothing else this movie makes ""Jason X"" look like high art.

""Leprechaun in the Hood"" - The Leprechaun begins a one man war in the hood when his magic flute is stolen. Ice-T as a record company exec is over the top and worth a few laughs. This entry may actually be my favorite of the bunch. The comedy works in this movie, the wannabe rappers are really funny and play well of Ice-T and the Leprechaun.

""Leprechaun Back 2 tha Hood"" - Continuing with the theme from the last film, the little bad is chasing down a bunch of ghetto kids who've taken his pot of gold. This one is tough to sit through, (maybe not as tough as ""In Space""...but pretty tough) and retreads most of the jokes from the last film, but it's still enjoyable in a horrible way.

The first film is actually a fun, somewhat family friendly horror film, with just a touch of gore, most kids will enjoy the stupidity. The rest of the series not so much, as the gore, boobs and body count all go way up.",1414713600,2,2549,4.364978902953586

1633014,5,B00005NFYY,If you plan on getting all of the leprechaun movies ONLY buy this and wait for it to arrive. I thought I was getting a the boxset with the first five movies in it but I guess they updated the pot of gore collection. What I got was a single case with ALL of the leprechaun movies inside of it. If I had bought Back 2 Tha Hood I would have wasted my money because this was included with it. Each disc has it's own place so they don't touch and each movie is on it's own disc so you there is no double sided discs either. I was really glad that I got this because it saved me some space on the shelf. I am not sure if there is a way to know which version of the pot of gore collection you get when you order it but I wouldn't buy back 2 tha hood just incase you get the updated one. Love the movies they are cheesey silly fun and really nostalgic for me.,1404864000,,851,3.8135593220338984
1633015,5,B00005NFYY,"So, yeah.  If one is looking for actual historical information on leprechauns, they probably will feel these movies as a waste of time.  If there are viewers out there who want to be intrigued by what they watch, these two will be very disappointed.  If anyone out there likes to be entertained just for the fun of it, then THEY WILL LOVE THESE HORROR FLICKS!

These are not all of the Leprechaun movies out there.  In total, there are 6 of them, as far as I know.  This set only has the first 4.  It's amazing, because for B-movie thrillers, Warwick Davis (who plays the ornery critter) has as many sequels as Robert England (who played the  ""Freddy"" in the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series).  So, even if ""Leprechaun"" movies are not the best ""scary"" movies out there, they must have done well enough to have 5 sequels to the original movie.

I feel that there should be some warnings however.  The first movie doesn't have any gore or nudity in it and in my opinion, is the best one of these four.  The second movie does have nudity, but no gore.  The third movie is very strong on sexuality and has gore in it.  The fourth movie is a lot like the second, a little nudity but no gore (except for the floating body parts at the end).  I have noticed that not a lot of people get killed in the first movie (two, three at most--one is rather questionable if the leprechaun actually killed her or not).  As the series rolls on, the body counts do have a tendency to rise with each successive movie.

I love these movies, only because they appeal to my inner mischievous psyche that doesn't make too much ado about rules, or logic.  Just pure mayhem and man, I tell you what...  It is funnier than all get out!  I mean, seriously, the monster here thinks of oh, so many creative ways to kill people and joke about it; and even his remarks are probably funnier than what Freddy could ever come up with!  For some real funny laughs with a tinge of naughty (grungy at worst) watch the Vegas film (the third in the series).  The fourth is, to me anyway, the funniest!

No plots?  Of course there is....  It is just a very simple one.  Don't cross paths with a leprechaun.  Don't take his gold.  Don't get in the way of his ""blessed"" bride to be.  Don't do any of these things and expect your life to be hunky dory.  For an old short guy, he sure is a scraper!  It is nice to see someone this old who kills anybody and everyone regardless of color, race, handicap, gender, orientation or religion.  One true equal opportunity ""I'll mess you up!"" kinda guy.....",1404172800,,2561,4.360169491525424

All four movies are in 4:3 (1.33.1) Fullscreen.

Leprechaun has a good, sharp and clear transfer while Leprechaun 2 losses much of the quality of the first one. Leprechaun 3 and 4 offer a much better quality picture than 3 while the first movie has the best overall quality. I don't mind them being in Fullscreen, it's better than a non-anamorphic widescreen picture that would have humongous black bars on a 16x9 TV.

For Five dollars it's a good deal, but if the price goes up I would pass. I would much rather have a good quality, anamorphic transfer.",1402099200,4,818,4.476510067114094

1633066,5,B00005NFYY,"First of all, I know these movies have received a lot of negative reviews, but I want you to go into this repeating the following mantra: ""It's the Leprechaun.""  These movies are not meant to be serious horror, like ""The Shining"" or even slashers like ""Halloween"" but to be funny and entertaining, which they are in droves.  There is little consistency between them, aside from the fiendishly funny portrayal of the Leprechaun by Warwick Davis, but really, who cares.  Again, It's the Leprechaun.  In each one, the victims do stupid things, and the Leprechaun kills them in funny ways.  There are sexy ladies and hunky (and some dorky) guys, funny bit characters, and lots of goofy rhymes by the Leprechaun.  So, if you want to have a good laugh and see some jerks getting killed by a crazy little green guy who is constantly making quirky rhymes, go for it.  And for $5 you can't beat the value.  If you want to see a higher quality Leprechaun movie, go for ""Leprechaun in the Hood"" which appears to have a higher budget, has a much better plot and story, good acting, directing, cinematography, music, and, of course, you can't go wrong with Ice-T.",1395878400,,1150,4.658415841584159

They are funny and filled with an angry but witty leprechaun who only loves his gold and will use whatever means necessary to get what he wants.

1633125,5,B00005NFYY,"Leprechaun is a fun movie series.  It's not to be confused with the Friday the 13th or Halloween series which are more scary.  Leprechaun, while containing some gore, is more tongue in cheek.  It's similar to the later Nightmare on Elm Street movies where Freddy becomes a jokester...although I would say those are still scarier than Leprechaun.  I love the little Leprechaun in these movies and, much like Freddy in Nightmare, his personality is half the fun in these movies.  If you like to kick back with some popcorn and watch campy, funny, and sometimes even gory horror, this is the series for you.  I would have given it 5 stars, but the DVDs don't have any extras on them and this set also does not contain the 6th and final Leprechaun movie, Back 2 Tha Hood, which I bought separately.

He got blown up in Leprechaun 2. I am curious about what will happen to him in Leprechaun 3. So I have to buy or rent Leprechaun 3. Anyway, I recommend both Leprechaun 1 & 2.

So, naturally, I felt that this was a better buy. In fact, my client was thrilled that he received four movies instead of just the one. The only thing that I did not like was that the 2nd disc with the third and fourth movie had one movie per side.

1633263,4,B00005NFYY,I'm partial to the Leprechaun movies (except the first one) because they make me laugh hysterically (especially the L in the Hood movies which I hope are eventually packaged in a similar set).  I'm probably the only person that ever had a leprechaun movie marathon in the annals of history.  These are stripped down films as well but I don't watch a b-movie for a behind the scenes look at the making of the movie anyway.  You have to match your expectations with the price you're paying.  It's 1.50 per film (or less) so you can't expect criterion presentation!  Leprechaun in space is completely awful and that's what makes it the best of the bunch because it's so dumb you can't help but laugh.,1305331200,8,697,4.588709677419355
1633264,5,B00005NFYY,"The Leprechaun series contains some of my favorite guilty pleasures. The series as a whole is just cheesy fun. Four of the movies are included in this set. Leprechaun stars Jennifer Aniston and it is goofy fun, in the tradition of Killer Klowns From Outer Space and Jack Frost. Leprechaun 2 is my least favorite in this set, but it still has its moments, my favorite being where an obviously gay character is killed by an espresso machine. Leprechaun 3 is a definite step up from both Leprechaun and Leprechaun 2. It's funnier, gorier, and has some good actors that include Caroline Williams (Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2). However, my personal favorite of the series is Leprechaun 4: In Space. It works as a funny and fast-paced homage/spoof of Aliens. It's just a ton of fun, and includes a half man/half spider, as well as Giant Leprechaun. All in all, I'd say that this series is almost on par with the Child's Play series.",1296000000,4,924,4.674846625766871

1633288,4,B00005NFYY,"Leprechaun- I think this is a pretty good horror/comedy movie! Warwick Davis is awesome as the Leprechaun. After 10 years, Leprechaun is freed from his crate, because Daniel O'Grady put a four leaf clover on it. Whenever his gold is stolen, Leprechaun goes on a rampage by killing whoever has it. I highly recommend LEPRECHAUN!!!

Leprechaun 2- After 1000 years, Leprechaun is resurrected and tries to find a bride. If she sneezes three times without being blessed, she will be his. He picks Bridget O'Day, so her boyfriend, Cody tries to stop him. I'd probably recommend LEPRECHAUN 2!!!

Leprechaun 3- This is probably my favorite Leprechaun movie because it has a better storyline and I like the characters, and it takes place place in Las Vegas. The Leprechaun is more funny in this one. After being resurrected at a Las Vegas pawn shop, Leprechaun goes after Scott McCoy because he stole Lep's gold coin. This time, you can make a wish while holding the coin, and it'll come true. Tammy Larsen, a woman who works at the Casino tries to help Scott throughout the bloody night. I highly recommend LEPRECHAUN 3!!!

Leprechaun 4: In Space- This is my least favorite Leprechaun film. Leprechaun tries to marry an alien princess. He doesn't rhyme this time, and it's futuristic. Unless you are a big Leprechaun fan, I probably wouldn't recommend LEPRECHAUN 4: IN SPACE!!!

Leprechaun in the Hood- This is my 2nd favorite Leprechaun film. A pimp takes Leprechaun's golden flute and years later, some rappers take it and the medallion. Because they took the medallion, Leprechaun is loose again, and tries to kill the rappers who stole his flute. I love the very end when the Leprechaun raps! I highly recommend LEPRECHAUN IN THE HOOD!!!",1237248000,,1733,4.884353741496598

I would suggest this movie to anyone who likes to see a little man go after gold and will stop at nothing to get it. but one thing i like best about these movies is the fact that with each movie they don't tie in with each other, in other words when the movies end the next one doesnt explain why or how he is still alive. To me it's like different short stories of a leprechaun and his gold. I would recomend this to anyone who dreamed of finding a pot-of-gold and not thinking there are concenquences, this might change your mind. Over all these movies are great entertainment and will be for your kids when they grow up and realise that Lucky isn't what he's cracked up to be. Well I hope this review is helpful and if you do purchase this collection it will be hours of entertainment as it was for me out in Iraq.",1123718400,10,947,4.146739130434782

Leprechaun is pretty well ok movie, it trys to scare you. The rest of the movies are just pieces of crap. It goes from Crap 2 The biggest piece of crap you will ever witness in your life.

  C'mon a Leprechaun in space. Now, if that isn't stupid i don't know what is, and how he gets there still amazes me. How does he get in the space shuttle? A space Marine pisses on his leg, which from that piss travels into the marine and later pops out of his crotch during intercourse. Wow!!! i'll just leave it at that .

1633295,3,B00005NFYY,"I picked up the Leprechaun 3 disc box set here in Australia for a cheap price. But it only contains the first 3. Theres no other box set here of Leprechaun. So I'll just reveiw the first 3 movies.

Leprechaun * * * (3 stars)- Warwick Davis (Willow, Ewok Wicket) plays the Leprechaun who is hunting down a man who has stolen his gold. The old man tries to destory the Leprechaun but instead leaves him inside a locked crete in his basement where he failed to finish him off. The old man has a stroke and moved to a retirment home. 10 years later a father and daughter move into the house. The daughter is played by *barf* Jennifer Aniston (Friends) she is an abnoxious teenager who doesnt like the house but decides to stick around when she finds a local buy she fancies. Eventualy the crete is opened and the Leprechaun escapes his prison and searching for his gold. Killing anybody who has his gold or gets in the way, the sinister warped mind of the Leprechaun seeks out his victoms singing his ryhems. Will they survive? Or will the Leprechaun take his revenge? Only a dozen ways to find out. The other charctors of the movie, I do recignise some of them, but I don't know there names, I know the kid was in ""Mr. Nanny"" the Hulk hogan movie. And The fat guy was Chubby in Teenwolf and in the recent Gacy movie. But I dunno there names, anyway who cares.

Leprechaun 2 (***)- Somehow the Leprechauns back. And he be searchin' for 'is bride. He is stalking a bueatiful girl played by some unknown who is a blood reletive to someone he tried to marry 1000 years before, or something like that. But he's going to have to fight to keep her because her boyfriend won't let her go without a fight. with the help of his horror tours boss. The 2 of them go looking for the Leprecahun and try to find his girl. Theres a few funny scenes, and some low budget but ok effects.
About the only actor I recignised was Michael McDonald (MadTV) who plays a queer cafe worker who says the wrong thing to the Leprechaun and pays for it.

Leprechaun 3 (***)- The Leprechaun is somehow a stone statue that a bum takes to a pawn shop in Las Vega to cash in for some gas money. He warns the owner not to take the amulet off its neck. But does so anyway. Of coarse the wee little bugger is back and up to his usual tricks. And still someone has stolen one of his coins and so he's out looking for it and doing what he usualy does. A few more funny scenes, and some things that had potentioal, but probably didn't have the budget to do more with. Cant say I knew any of the actors, but that just makes the movie good to have unknowns, you don't really wanna be watching the one person you do recignise all the time.

I wouldnt call these scary horror movies. Some parts of them are humorus, there's hardly any killing in any of them, not much gore for any of you blood thirsty fans. Most of the death scenes are cut away. I haven't got a clue what the next 2 Leprechaun movies where like, but I aint in a hurry to see them. The DVD's don't contain any bonus features at all. You get the menu/scene selection and the movie, and thats it. Not even subtitles!

But the movies are pretty good. There b grade horror flicks, I wouldnt praise them, I wouldnt say there great, but I wouldnt say they are bad either. Leprechaun is a cool image. The make up looks great on Warwick Davis and he plays a pretty good role of the sinister and coniving Leprechaun and his evil magic.

A recomended movie for you softcore horror fans who like the Imaage of a cool villian. Or worth it to pass time on a rainy day.

EDIT:
LEPRECHAUN 4 IN SPACE (1 and half stars)
The acting is terrible, the plot is a big WTF? The CGI is not even laughable its so bad, the whole movie stinks and should become any of the actors from its first wish to be erased from if they ever where granted a leprechauns 3 wishes. I wish I had not bought it, I wish i had not bought it, I wish I had not baought it.",1106006400,2,3944,4.188405797101449

1633338,4,B00005NFYY,"Yay! All five Leprechaun movies in the proverbial pot of gore! Nothing beats an original idea, and the first ""Leprechaun"" film does spark marginal interest about the shenanigans onscreen. The film opens with an Irishman named Dan O'Grady managing to capture a leprechaun, thereby forcing the little monster to give up his pot of gold. Regrettably for Danny, the evil fairy isn't about to give up his wealth without a fight, tracking down the man who robbed him just in time to open up a big can of hurt on the man's wife and inflicting a massive stroke/heart attack type illness on O'Grady. Before he does so, however, Danny Boy traps the leprechaun in a wooden crate and imprisons him there by placing a four-leaf clover on the top of the box. It seems that Irish folk monsters cannot withstand this powerful charm, and it looks as though the leprechaun will be trapped forever in this abandoned house. Before too long, Jennifer Aniston and a few B movie actors turn up to do an Irish jig with the Leprechaun. ""Leprechaun"" is the first and arguably the best film in the franchise.
Warwick Davis returns as the foul-mouthed imp in ""Leprechaun 2,"" a movie that finds the little man concerned about securing a bride. According to the film the leprechaun can only marry once every thousand years or so (I know; he said he was 600 years old in the first installment. What do you want from me? I didn't write any of these movies.). Since it is quite difficult to find a woman when your face looks like a burnt pizza, Leppie decides to use those old Irish charms of magic and trickery when he spots a fair haired lass hanging laundry out in the middle of a forest (!). Things don't work quite as planned, so the leprechaun keeps track of the offspring of his fetching lass through the ages. In fact, a map at the beginning of the film tracks the descendents down through time, even showing a point when one of the women sails to America. The thousand years are just about up, meaning the diminutive beastie must once again find and marry for love, and this time the potential bride is Bridget, a blonde airhead who looks suspiciously like the leprechaun's original cutie from the beginning of the film.
In ""Leprechaun 3,"" the little beastie appears in Las Vegas when a haggard looking fella stumbles into a pawnshop lugging a bundle. It turns out that this package is our old friend the leprechaun, frozen into a statue due to some jeweled necklace. The guy sells the statue to the pawnshop owner for chump change and as quick as you can say ""Begorrah,"" the greedy employee removes the necklace and unleashes the malevolent force that is Warwick Davis decked out in knickers and cheap makeup. The pot of gold appears as well, and since we all know that the slimy sprite cannot stand to see humans pawing his precious coins, the pawnshop guy promptly incurs the wrath of the little devil. It is also during these opening sequences that we learn the rules of the game have changed once again: now the leprechaun cannot stand the presence of other leprechauns, and his gold coins suddenly have the power to grant their possessor one wish. Obviously, this knowledge sets up the idea that another leprechaun will challenge Warwick Davis and that several people will find one of the coins and make wishes.
""Leprechaun 4"" is the type of film that only the most metaphysically hardy individuals should watch. As I sat in my easy chair, buffeted by the splendorous emanations pouring out of the television screen and speakers, I pondered whether my mind could handle the multifaceted plot, canyon deep characters, whipsaw fast pacing, and dialogue that surely issued from the mouth of that most benevolent deity watching over each and every one of us from his throne in the stars. Seriously, I am just funning around. We all know, as anyone who sacrificed ninety minutes of their life to watch this dullsville production knows, that this movie reeks to high heaven. ""Leprechaun 4"" boasts Debbe Dunning, a group of space marines, and the actor who played that geeky guy in ""Bachelor Party,"" the one with the huge glasses that lined up the female entertainment for the Tom Hanks character's hotel bash. Why doesn't ""Leprechaun 4"" work? Because it boasts Debbe Dunning, a group of space marines, and the actor who played that geeky guy in ""Bachelor Party,"" the one with the huge glasses that lined up the female entertainment for the Tom Hanks character's hotel bash. ""Leprechaun 4"" ought to come with a syringe of Thorazine because that's the only way anyone will get through this one without significant mental scarring.
It is important to state that ""Leprechaun 5"" is vastly superior to its immediate predecessor. After watching the diminutive demon cackle his way through space, I didn't know what to expect from this film. I knew I would get some killings and see Davis deliver ham handed lines in a thick Irish brogue, but I swore I would toss my DVD player through the window before I endured a repeat of the fourth movie. Don't get me wrong: this movie still ranks as mediocrity incarnate, but it is at least watchable. Perhaps the appearance of Ice-T and the three actors who played the young rappers looking for a big break helped move this picture along. Even the guys who played the money grubbing minister and the cross dresser who has an unfortunate encounter with the leprechaun provided a few chuckles along the way. Overall, the performances here are far above several entries in the series. That's the pot of gore. Think you can handle it? Luck o' the Irish to ye if ye can!",1089676800,60,5574,4.7004089979550105
1633339,5,B00005NFYY,"When the first Leprechaun came out in 1993, it scared the crap out of me.  Granted I was only 6 years old, but Leprechaun part 1 will always remind me of running out of the living room, and hiding under my bed.  Over the Course of 10 years 5 more instalment to the series have been release, all of which are with their merits (except part 4, that is just... bad, and not in a good way).
This set is the easiest and cheapest way to collect the first 5 movies in the series.  Heres a Breakdown of the movies...
Leprechaun 1 - A girl moves with her father to a small farm house in South Dakota, but find a Box with a Leprechuan hidden in it.  There is a very young Jennifer Aniston as the star. A-
Leprechaun 2 - The Leprechaun waits 1000 years to came the desendet of a peasant girl as his bride. B-
Leprechaun 3 - The Leprechaun goes to Vegas, and in turn makes this the best offering in the set, besides #1. B+
Leprechaun 4 - The Leprechaun tries to clam a space goddess as his bride, but gets tangeled up with a crew of a spacestation. D-
Leprachaun 5 - A group of rappers steal the Leprechauns Gold. C
I really enjoy the Leprechaun movies (along with alot of 80s/90s Bish horror films) and found this box set a great addition to my DVD collection.
The only reason I could not give it 5 stars is due to the lack of Specail Features.  Their should be something more than a trailer for each movie.  Think about how cool it would be to see some interviews from 1993 with Jennifer Aniston, or maybe a featurette on the makeup of the leprechaun, something like that.",1083456000,6,1562,4.172757475083056

LEPRECHAUN- Before she made it big with ""Friends"", the future Mrs. Brad Pitt herself, Jennifer Aniston starred in the first Leprechaun movie. Probably the best of the series.
LEPRECHAUN 2- A decent sequel with all kinds of gore and bad Irish jokes. Any movie where a guy is killed making love to a fan can't be all bad.
LEPRECHAUN 3- This one is pretty much the same as the last one with even dumber characters and a Vegas setting.
LEPRECHAUN 4- The Leprechaun in Space? Hilariously awful. Features Miguel A. Nunez, Debbie Dunning (The Tool Time Girl on ""Home Improvement"") and a cross-dressing robot.
