I feel that in life I was *supposed* to be a waterman but I guess events and choices I've made in my life steered me away from that path.  Still I am drawn to the water, I feel like it calls to me.  I watched this documentary with tears in my eyes - I feel like I know these people,  and I feel and share the pain in their words when they admit that their way of life - and the waters upon which they made their living was quickly fading away.  But the end of the documentary does offer hope that the bay and they waterman's way of life can still be saved, although oyster farming may not be as traditional as dredging or tonging - you're still on the water and I would love to get involved in oyster farming - not sure how the wife and kids would feel about it but again, I feel that I was meant to be a waterman and I would love to play a part in helping to save the wonderful natural resource that is the Chesapeake Bay.  Thanks to all of you who were involved in making this fantastic documentary.  God bless.",1393545600,,1121,3.995515695067265

In the 1960's and 1970's I launched my boat at the Deep Creek boat ramp and used the pier. I felt a great deal of pride in the way PBS presented the information. My family were waterman in the late 1800's and early 1900's. Since the late 1600's, the watermen of Deep Creek and the James River, have fished, crabbed and oystered these water and tied their boats in the natural harbor.  The waterman of Deep Creek and the James River have fed many families in the Virginia region. It was said these men harvested the best oysters on the East Coast. I was very disappointed when the pier was torn down by the City of Newport News. It is very sad to see how the oyster and crab industry has declined. There are very few ""working"" boats left in the Deep Creek harbor. Thanks to PBS for showing the public with this documentary ,the condition of the Chesapeake Bay, the James River and the decline of a way of life. Henry Piland",1379203200,2,1080,4.3681592039801
