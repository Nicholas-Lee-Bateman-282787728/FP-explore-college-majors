8359296,4,B002ACPNRG,"Good movie.  Enjoyed the make-up application.  Pretty good story line.  Movie quality not so good, but acceptable.  Good Movie to watch.",1366243200,,136,5.333333333333333
8359297,4,B002ACPNRG,"If you're in the mood for a very poorly made zombie flick that will keep you laughing all the way through, this is for you!!",1355961600,,124,4.0
8359298,1,B002ACPNRG,This is probably the worst zombie movie to date. I am easily ammused but I couldn't keep my attention on this horrible video and audio quality. Its all muffled and blurry and they didn't even try to write or act a good script. I'm pretty sure they were doing this as a joke most of the time. Do your self a favor and watch another zombie movie.,1337644800,2,344,4.149253731343284
8359299,1,B002ACPNRG,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY RENTING THIS! Trust me, it's a waste.  It must have been filmed on a $100 budget and I'm being generous. Horrible acting, horrible film quality and horrible effects - a REAL horror movie.",1336176000,3,219,4.475
8359300,5,B002ACPNRG,"If you're like me and have any imagination at all, then you'll love this movie because it gives you something that Hollywood quit giving us 40 years ago, which is unflinching gore and shock effect. The days of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre style horror has been replaced with overbudget, predictable, unrisky, over-the-top prop gadgetry that has been done to death until it's no longer an experience, but just an exercise in saying we've been to a movie under the guise of horror.

If you want to sit and watch CGI effects and rediculous amounts of camera angles for the sole purpose of feeding the Hollywood dollar gobbler, then you'll want to stick to your safe movies that have been told a million times over, by people who have zero to lose by making the film. There is nothing better than watching a team of work-for-free actors and behind-the-camera techs lending their vision, time and necks on the chopping block of public ridicule, getting nothing but the satisfaction of knowing they did something, and not sat on their ass and slammed someone else's hardwork. If any of the people criticizing this movie spent less time writing negative reviews and tried putting pen to paper, pumping out a script, hiring people to work for free, putting up their own money, trying to get keepable shots while working without permits, or the help of Hollywood advertising, then maybe they would allow a little creative liscense and understand that the little girl in this film has more talent and guts in her little finger than all of these critics combined. Me, on the other hand, I choose not to let Hollywood whisper in my ear that their way of doing things is correct.

Shaky camera work is creepy. Unknown actors is easy to believe in. Poor lighting and picture quality is the lifeblood of classic horror. If you're the kinda person who thinks SAW 1 is a classic or needs Hollywood to digest your movies for you then please avoid this movie at all cost, coz you just won't get it, and you should also donate your 1972 original copy of Texas Chainsaw Massacre (as if you have the balls to own one) over to someone who deserves it (like anyone old enough to remember when horror movies were actually designed to creep you out).

I hope they make a sequel and do it the exact same way. I hope this influences others to do the same. I'll be the first in line for honest film making every time.",1330732800,,2396,4.619718309859155
8359301,1,B002ACPNRG,"...but this effort deserves it.  I can appreciate that the ""director"" and ""actors"" are amateurs and have never studied film in any way other than simply watching other movies and trying to do what they think the other movies did, only using a camera that they picked up at Best Buy, but this is not even watchable.

I actually feel bad about giving this such a bad review, as it is apparently a family affair.  Unfortunately the father can't direct or write and the daughter can't act... to be fair, the rest of the cast is equally bad, but that's what you get when you pay your ""actors"" with pizza and Kroger-brand beverages.  To be fair, I watched a number of excerpts from this ""director's"" other ""films"" to see if he got any better; he didn't.

From what I can tell, this ""director"" seems to find something that happened in some other movie (in this case, he decided that the Texas Chainsaw Massacre II needed zombies) and then he makes his own ""movie"" with his family.  This is absolutely wonderful for family and friends to watch and I would even tell him that he did a good job, were it not for the fact that he is serious and is actually attempting to sell the product.

Go to IMDB and look the ""director"" up and watch all the trailers you can, then you will know what you have in store for you when you accidentally click ""buy it now"" and tragically order this steamer.",1316908800,5,1378,4.4015748031496065
8359302,1,B002ACPNRG,"Well I guess you can't always go by the first few reviews. This was almost the worst zombie movie I have ever seen. Bad acting, Terrible sound, and camera work. Whats up with the extreme closeups, and hand held camera? The only redeeming quality to this film is the soundtrack, if you like country blues. And the nostalgic drive in movie clips. Besides that, Sorry this movie is a no go. Don't get me wrong I like all types of zombie movies, and try to give them all a chance, but this one... just didn't deserve the one star that I gave it, and definitely not the 5 stars the other folks gave it. Thats my story, and I'm stickin' to it.",1311206400,4,637,4.229508196721311
8359303,5,B002ACPNRG,"This is an excellent throw back to a 70's drive-in movie.  If you like cheesy horror movies, this is for you.  It is an excellent way to spend a Saturday night!",1244073600,2,160,4.129032258064516
8359304,5,B002ACPNRG,"I loved it, it was a really fun movie. I thought the Drive In thing really worked. The story was really good,and all the actors even though there were no big names, really did a good job. I was very impressed with the little girl, Audrey Evans, I look forward to seeing her in more films. The scenes with her and Bubba, played by S. Mike Davis were my favorites, you really felt the connection. S. Mike was awsome as Bubba, in the big climax I found myself cheering out loud for him. Brad Maroney and Ramie Mercado were alot of fun to watch, you really felt like they were long time buddies. Without giving anything away, this movie has alot of firsts as far as things you have never in a film like this. Bottom line I love it, it was just a fun movie to watch, I would love to see another installment, I think there is alot more story to tell...",1243641600,5,846,4.164634146341464
8359305,5,B002ACPNRG,The Zombie Overlord makes the movie.  The actor who plays the Overlord bring layers of emotion and soul to the charector.  I can't wait for the sequel.,1242950400,6,151,4.555555555555555
