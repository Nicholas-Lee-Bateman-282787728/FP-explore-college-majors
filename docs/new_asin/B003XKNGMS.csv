If you are a fan of TV Westerns, however campy or stereotypical, you'll probably like this collection. If you're a fan of classic Trek, you might enjoy it as a novelty. If you don't know classic Trek or classic westerns, pass it up, as it isn't a good intro to either.",1291248000,35,1117,5.445086705202312

8408177,5,B003XKNGMS,"to see the same actors being someone else, in a different setting was fun.  William Shatner was great I have been a  fan of him for some time.",1402099200,4,142,4.035714285714286
8408178,2,B003XKNGMS,"I just checked this out to see what episodes they chose and wow what a disappointment. This DVD set is way to heavily focused on Nimoy and Shatner.

And yet you have Deforest Kelley also one of the main leads of the show and arguably more associated with Westerns than any of the other Star Trek actors and they could only pick 1 thing he was in.",1374278400,,346,4.164179104477612
8408179,5,B003XKNGMS,"I bought this DVD from Amazon but I have seen these different episodes with the Star Trek actors in Western setting and they were good.  De Forest Kelley was the most experienced with the western type film.  Leonard Nimoy is either and Indian or usually a bad guy I guess his exotic looks that made him a great Mr. Spock work against him in those roles. Willian Shatner is always good, he doesn't seem to eat up the scenery as in later roles.

A good investment, these episodes I had were on VHS tapes but those don't last as long as these DVDs, so I have went to DVDs in all Star Trek related actor roles.

You will really enjoy them.",1305849600,7,635,4.223140495867769
8408180,5,B003XKNGMS,"Maybe 20 years ago, TNT had a day of westerns with Star Trek regulars.  But I never thought something like this would come out on DVD.  I can't get over what a terrible native James Doohan makes.  This is all about about pure love for the people who made Star Trek a phenomenon.  I had seen some of these shows, but far from all.  Add this to your collection.",1296950400,5,359,4.144927536231884
8408181,2,B003XKNGMS,"I had a chance to go through this recently. More like a joke but the good thing is, if you want to see what kind work the original Star Trek folks have done prior to the fame TV show, this DVD will show you some of their worst moments in western TV. You can probably show it at the conventions to embarrassed them. I won't though, I think DeForest Kelly and Jimmy Doohan deserves better. While some episodes are not really that bad, some are totally bad. The previous reviewer wrote some of the titles so I can move on. The real bad thing about this DVD is the poor quality of the images and looks. It bad enough that some of the stuff you are looking at is pretty terrible stuff (Shatner's White Comanche is bad enough to make us regurgitate all the food we ate for the past several days) but picture quality is also pretty terrible as well. Of course I suppose the cover of the DVD might be worth the price...if you can get Nimoy and Shatner to autograph it!! This collection only shows Shatner, Nimoy, Kelly and Doohan, no one else. Strictly for Star Trek fans with a hard stomach.",1294358400,,1084,4.2926829268292686
