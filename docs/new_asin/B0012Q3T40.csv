3093028,5,B0012Q3T40,"This dvd is so encouraging.  I am born again christian who is saved and radically transformed by His power.  This world is filled with casual christians and false preachers hunger for money and personal gain rather than saving souls.  Our Lord and Savior did not have place to lay His head on this earth suffered in every way men can suffer and is killed to save our soul, yet so many using His name collecting fortune and their followers who is devoid of understaning support them thinking that they are doing God's will.  Many times I wonder just how many of us true believers are really out there?  Through Tim Scott and Will decker's work I saw gunuine faith, love, passion for His word which is burning within me also.  Without absolute unshakable faith they couldn't have faced so many life threatning dangers and trials with smile.  ""You shall know them by their fruit"". I found  Their courage to live out faith is very eddifying.  We are all missionaries sent by God to bring light to this dark and hopeless place.  Watch this dvds you will be entertained and encouraged.  I found TTR season 3 on TTR website for those who want following episodes.
To Tim and Will, I pray that you guys will never lose that faithfullness in the Lord.  Always sold out for Jesus and always filled with Holy spirit.  We, the brethers in Christ is watching, carefully following you with prayer, cheer, and hope, We may never see each other down here but in our heavenly home we shall know each other as we are known.
Praise the Lord!",1273190400,5,1521,4.547794117647059
3093029,5,B0012Q3T40,I love watching the Travel the Road DVD's and following Tim and Will as they passionately pursue those who may have never heard the gospel message. It is so inspiring to see these missionaries totally abandoned to God and going wherever the holy spirit might lead them. I highly recommend buying these DVD's if you want to be challenged in your own personal walk with Christ. Prepare to go along with them on an adventure and seeing the world from a new perspective. Tim and Will always seem to find the humor in any situation and truly are humble.,1272067200,3,548,4.545454545454546
3093030,5,B0012Q3T40,"These two young men have laid it down.  They have taken what the Word says, applied it to their lives, AND THEY LIVE IT.  They don't seek out the comforts of easy locations, of people who are already primed to hear God's Word.  No, that's not what they're about at all.  They go into the least desirable places anyone could imagine going to -- war zones, leech-infested jungles, areas known for their witchcraft and cannibalism, areas known for their bitter hatred (and murder) of Christians.  Not with fear or dread, either, do they set out on their trips.  They do it with joyful hearts, and the message they present is given with such love and with such heartfelt sincerity that I challenge any believer to watch this series without a box of Kleenex (I used my shirt sleeve).  I, as a Christian, was humbled when I saw the way these men lived.  I was grieved at my heart for my own self-preoccupation, for my selfish attitude and motives.  These two missionaries are part of the true church -- fishers of men, the way Christ instructed us to be (without any denominational foolishness involved).  Watching this series is quality time, and this review really applies to the whole series.  I went on Amazon today to find out if they'd made any more of these DVDs, but this is the last one that has come out.  To Mr. Decker and Mr. Scott: please make more of these!",1269734400,4,1365,4.526530612244898

8247137,2,B0012Q3T40,"Case was broken when opened from the film covering. Disappointed because when I buy things new I like to keep them in great condition and I already have a busted case and can't just replace it with an extra one, it's a 3dvd set.

**Also it is not full screen like season 1 is. Has an annoying black border making viewing not as enjoyable.",1424736000,,338,4.28125

8247141,5,B0012Q3T40,"This covers slightly disturbing people groups than did season one.  There are dead bodies and other graphics that aren't for kids, in my opinion.  Excellent coverage of remote peoples and remarkable faith of these young men!",1362960000,,224,5.194444444444445
