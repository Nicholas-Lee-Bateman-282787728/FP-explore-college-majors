This hacked up version of the film is incomplete, misleading and suffers from  poor video quality.  For whatever reason, the true credits have been stripped off, and names were added who had nothing to do with the film.

Dr. Jankowski, one of the added names, knows nothing about this film and does not know why his name is on it.

The film was actually made by Walton Dornisch and Mark Horowitz who deserve every credit for creating it.  The film deserves better and buyers deserve better.

8176490,4,B000NA6E6G,"$50 for a 30 minute video is pricey under any circumstances, but ultimately it was worth it for this very rare personal glimpse at a man who was justifiably called the master of the now-archaic art of traditional matte painting. The universal admiration for the man and his talents was quite evident in the interviews with famous directors and producers included here. It's particularly fun to see how much Mel Brooks respected Whitlock, and watching him trade quips with the master in the screening room was an unexpected bonus. Recommended if you are old enough to fondly remember old-school movie magic and the people who created it, carefully by hand.",1319587200,,655,4.963636363636364
