7964418,5,B000068NLS,"We have all but one of these Disney Read-Along DVDs and the whole family (and friends) loves them.  The words are at the bottom of the screen (in choice of 5 languages) which is great for reading skills.  The audio also can be switched between 5 languages (Engish, French, German, Italian, Spanish).  It is fun and interesting to watch it in the various languages, not to mention a great exposure to languages for children (for us all really).

We regularyly watch them in Italian, to enjoy the language and help keep up our Italian.  There are days when we watch a few in German, Spanish or French (the languages we speak least in our home, though I know Spanish and my husband speaks French).  We then go through the vocabulary.  Best feature is that you can choose from/change the audio or subtitle language at any time (except audio in music videos).

These are great, they are fun, they are very educational, we love them!

Oh, and about not having a book.  I suppose we are lucky, I had purchased all of the read-along sets I could find at a Wal-mart (before these DVDs came out).  So we have books for half of the DVDs (and also have the CDs & tapes).  If only they would make a CD version of the stories in different languages.",1140566400,3,1235,4.44
7964419,2,B000068NLS,"I agree with the previous reviewer.  I bought this as soon as it was released, and I thought it was the film (the photo and details were not available until it was actually released).  After watching it a couple times I am very disappointed.  This isn't worth the bother.  By the movie and a book.  Skip Mitch's bouncing ball!",1047168000,8,326,4.4576271186440675
7964420,2,B000068NLS,"I found this DVD a waste of money. I thought that it would include a book for my child to read along with, which it doesnt. It only has one game and my child mastered it early. It also only have one music video, and a poor choice at that. If I could I would of returned this item for a complete refund. But Amazon doesnt take back opened DVD's. Not recommend, save your money and buy the book.",1040515200,11,393,3.9873417721518987
