8334089,3,B001PPGALW,"Short movie, only 1 hour and 3 minutes.  Some funny lines.  Single woman goes after the man she wants.  The odd part is that she's more interested in the romance of it than anything of substance because she doesn't even know the guy.  Essentially, she wants him because of his name.  You'll have to watch the movie to understand what I'm talking about.",1505779200,,352,4.523809523809524
8334090,4,B001PPGALW,"Charming Fun movie from far nicer times. Charles Starrett ...later to gain fame as ""The Durango Kid"" is targeted as the ""Perfect Man"" by Irene Hervey, but first she has to catch him. Lot's of fun and misadventures until she finally does.",1451952000,,237,4.666666666666667
