BAD INTENTIONS

1. Jake O'Brien vs. Josh Schockman-Jake takes this fight by a judges decision after three rounds of not much. This was an ok fight O'Brien controlled the whole fight basically taking Josh down every time they were stood up. Over all this was a decent start to the event.

2. JAMES IRVIN vs. HECTOR RAMIREZ-Irvin takes this fight in the second round with a beautiful straight right hand that catches Ramirez after he throws a lazy left hook. The entire fight was great; this was an excellent addition to the card.

3. SHERMAN PENDERGARST vs. ANTONI HARDONK-this was a great fight, back and forth while the fight lasted, Antoni takes this fight after a nice combo with a left, right punch combo followed immediately by a vicious leg kick that takes out Sherman. This was a very entertaining fight, nice bout.

4. NICK DIAZ vs. GLEISON TIBAU-the first round of this fight was amazing, a great technical battle on the ground. Both fighters were giving it all they had, but by the end Tibau was gassing and looking pretty bad. In the second round Tibau was far too gone and gassed out, basically Diaz just out lasted him and got the win when the ref stopped the fight.

5. JOE STEVENSON vs. D. MISHIMA-this one ends in the first round when Mishma taps out after a deep guillotine choke, it would take two of these though to get him to tap out. This was a good but quick fight, nice edition to the show.

6. FRAMK MIR vs. BRANDON VERA-extremely surprising how quick this match was, I did not expect this fight to be over at just over one minute. After a well placed knee from Vera Mir goes down and is dominated on the ground, great win for Vera.

7. ALESSIO SAKARA vs. DREW McFEDRIES-very exciting fight between these two warriors, this was a beautiful back and forth battle standing up. It looked as if Drew was winning the stand up but soon Sakara was taking over the lead. The round went back and forth between the two until Sakara sir came to Drew towards the end of the round when the ref stopped it. Excellent fight, possibly the best on the card.

8.[HEAVYWIEGHT CHAMPIONSHIP] TIM SYLVIA vs. JEFF MONSON-this was a pretty good fight  between these two gladiators of the octagon. This fight would end up going the distance and have a sorry crowd in my opinion. After a really good fight that showcased both fighters really well, the crowd started booing Sylvia just because he didn't knockout Jeff. They should have shown the proper respect to both fighters and applauded these two for giving up a great fight. Over all Tim wins by decision.

9.[WELTERWIEGHT CHAMPIONSHIP] MATT HUGHES vs. GEORGE ST. PIERRE-my favorite fight of the evening saw GSP defeat Matt Hughes with a some what dominate performance. I really have never liked Hughes to much but this fight changed that. His sportsmanship after his loss changed my mind about the man as I thought he would cry about the loss. But he didn't and one of my all time favorites GSP became the champ with an excellent performance with a great TKO victory over a great defending champ in Hughes",1207526400,,3066,4.578467153284672

In the headline fight of the night, Georges St. Pierre finally gets his chance at redemption against the champion that had barely defeated him early on in his career. St. Pierre, now a seasoned and complete fighter, gets another crack at welterweight giant, Matt Hughes. The co-main event features heavyweight champion, Tim Sylvia, defending his coveted title against challenger Jeff Monson.

The night opens with Joe ""Daddy"" Stevenson (Matt Hughes's first selection on The Ultrimate Fighter Season 2) vs. Dokonjonosuke Mishima. Stevenson, already a veteran in MMA, impresses once again.

Next, rising heavyweight (should probably be light heavyweight) star Brandon Vera gets his ""biggest"" fight yet in the UFC against former champion on the comeback trail, Frank Mir. Mir has not looked good at all in his comeback fights inside the octagon and now he is facing a younger, faster fighter in Vera. Vera has made the claim that he would eventually secure both the light heavyweight and heavyweight belts, but let's just concentrate on beating the washed up fighter in front of you to pad your record first. This one is fun to watch...

Everyone loves a standup fight - and that is what we would all expect from Alessio Sakara and Drew McFedries. Sakara is a boxing champ from Italy and McFedries seems to be the new ""Robbie Lawler"" out of team Miletich. This one is a slugfest!

UFC newcomer Hector Ramirez takes on James ""Sandman"" Irvin. This is a decent fight and you won't have to sit through three full rounds, as it does not go the distance.

Co-main event time!!!! Feel free to take a nap at this point. Just as expected, the very short Jeff Monson has extreme difficulty getting past the lurching Tim Sylvia's long arms. Sylvia doesn't do much to try to end this one and Monson can't seem to do much, so this one just wears on and on.

The fight we all wanted to see: welterweight champion Matt Hughes finally faces Georges St. Pierre again. St. Pierre had lost to Hughes via a last second armbar submission way back at UFC 50. He had not been quite ready for that challenge then, but he is a different fighter now. Whether you already know the outcome of this fight or not, it is a true masterpiece. This is a must see. One man decides to play a dangerous game in this fight and he pays the painful price for it.

The DVD also contains a good deal of bonus footage from the days leading up to the fight. This is worth a watch. I highly recommend this DVD if for nothing other than the main event.",1193184000,3,2566,4.661504424778761
8172071,5,B000MTFFMM,"Firs of all, let me start by saying that within the last 2 years I have become a huge fan of MMA, especially the UFC thanks to the energetic support from Spike TV making these events available and accesible to the masses; Not all the bouts in this event were great but just to have the Matt Hughes- St Pierre fight is totally worth the price; And even though St. Pierre is no longer the Welterweght champion, he is a well rounded fighter and I hope to see more of him in this sport; Solid effort by Zuffa distributing these dvds,

Long live the UFC",1182816000,4,548,4.219047619047619
