8007986,4,B00018WMLG,Very good four pack of films. The story revolves around a mirror that contains possessed souls. The first story (With Karen Black) was my favorite. The other three are fairly good but you can tell that other directors and writers got hold of the story to tweak the a bit. Good movies if you like this kind of thing.,1385510400,,315,4.3559322033898304
8007987,4,B00018WMLG,"An interesting loose saga of B-horror movies whose only tie to one another lies in a single mirror. How the same mirror wind up in four separate locations is anyone's guess.

Mirror Mirror (1990), the first and best in the series, is about a shy new girl who quickly becomes the target of a raging Queen B of her new high school. But when she discovers a secret power emanating from an old mirror, her enemies soon begin dying one by one and its up to the girl's one and only friend to try and stop the mirror's reign of horror and save both their souls from a fate worse than death. Co starring B-movie favorite Karen Black, Mirror Mirror features the usual host of stereotype characters and cliche situations that made 80s horror so much fun and easy to hate but the real standout is a surprisingly strong bleak ending which was a true rarity for its time. A soundtrack was released and if anyone is interested you can find it here on Amazon by typing in Jimmy Lifton and Mirror Mirror in the search engine.

In Mirror Mirror 2: Raven's Dance (1993), we find that the mirror has relocated to the basement of a Catholic orphanage which seems to only have one child and his 16 going on 25 year old sister. Once more, strange deaths are beginning to happen all the while a greedy woman and her therapist lover secretly tries to rob the boy and his sister out of their inheritance. This movie was one of Mark Ruffalo's (Zodiac, In the Cut)  first film and really isn't as bad as some reviewers make it out to be. Not great but still enjoyable.

Mirror Mirror 3: The Voyeur (1995) then tries to take the series into new territory by making it (or attempting to) an erotic soft core skin flick. In this one, a man (Billy Drago of tv's Charmed) is plagued by nightly wet dreams of his dead lover who happened to be a witch or something who was killed while kneeling in front of,you guessed it, the mirror. Once again, the horror starts up and soon a body count slowly (and I do mean slowly) begins to rise. Worse of the bunch. The first ten minutes of the movie doesn't seem to even belong to the same movie.

And finally we get to the series swan song Mirror Mirror 4: Reflections (2000). In this final chapter and only available in this now OOP boxed set we see the mirror has now been moved to a run down theater (guess buying a demonic mirror capable of wiping out your family and friends isn't on top of everybody's shopping list) and a violent storm has stranded several partiers there for the night. As you can probably guess, for many this will be worse than breaking a mirror as each member of the group begins to fall under the mirror's evil spell. This one also has a popular former star PJ Soles (Halloween, Rock and Roll High School). That's really just about it except does anyone know if why this title was never released other than the fact that its so terrible?

So there you have it. The movies are all shown in their original full frame and there are NO special features. Despite their individual flaws, the Mirror Mirror saga is a fun and easy way to spend a rainy afternoon. Just don't go in expecting Peter Jackson SFX or Meryl Streep style acting and you'll be able to enjoy everything Mirror Mirror has to offer.

Update: As I revisited this set while writting this review, I noticed the labels on each disc doesn't go with the correct one except for maybe on Reflections. The correct label would go as follows:
 Disc One should have the label on Disc 3.
 Disc 2 should have the label on Disc 1.
 Disc 3 should have the label on Disc 2.

Also its a shame that Anchor Bay didn't include either a booklet chock full of information on the series like they did with the Sleepaway Camp Survival Pack or the usual poster replica inserts as they do with the vast majority of their releases.",1332288000,4,3802,4.378723404255319

8007989,2,B00018WMLG,the only reason to get this box set if for the original mirror mirror. mirror mirror is a cool film that many people don't know about. creepy at times and a interesting story line make it worth while. the other three movies are boring but worth a look... i guess.,1255824000,,263,4.28

8007991,1,B00018WMLG,"Don't believe what you read in some of the reviews.  This really stunk, and I wish I could get my money back.  As a rabid horror fan, with thousands of titles, this is one that I tossed in my donation bin.  At least I got the tax receipt for my taxes.",1243036800,,251,3.8823529411764706
