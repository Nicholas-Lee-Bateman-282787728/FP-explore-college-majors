8609845,5,B001IDZH92,"What a wild ride.  This is one strange film.  Enjoyable but strange.  Writer, Director Francis Xavier really needs to go to church for sure.  His story telling is wonderful but his images are so dark that certain scenes made me gag without seeing a drop of blood.  Great film but weird.
