I hereby ban them from all the world's disc pressing plants for eternity. This DVD contains six animated shorts; four chapter stops; and no menu. The image is letterboxed throughout, even though most of the animated shorts are in 4:3 aspect ratio. Video quality suggests it was mastered straight from the 1984 Vestron VHS tape that originally contained this program of shorts. The copy on the reverse says AWARD WINNING SHORT FILMS FROM AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING ""SUNDAE IN NEW YORK"", ""PARIS SCENES"" AND MANY MORE! This indicates that, when running down his production checklist, the producer of this DVD missed the item ""watch the DVD"". (You may see ""Paris Scenes"" in Paris, but you won't see them here.) Like an ice cream truck that plays ""It's a Small World"" and gets the melody wrong, this is funny for as long as it takes you to realize how bad it is and then it simply screams out ""Bad Touch"". Get a get laugh from that WTF cover art, then back away slowly and go watch ""The Hole"" on YouTube instead.",1353888000,3,1172,4.806930693069307
