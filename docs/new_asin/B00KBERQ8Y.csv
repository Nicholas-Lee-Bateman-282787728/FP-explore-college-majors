6413474,5,B00KBERQ8Y,"Entertaining, with cultural sights and actors who differ from the usual standard - enough bang bang and sexy girls too with a dose or real politik - so all in all good film!",1509753600,,173,4.2727272727272725
6413475,1,B00KBERQ8Y,"Looks like it was made by a couple of not-too-bright third graders from Latvia. Senseless direction, a silly script, and a soundtrack pieced together out of generic elevator muzak.",1508716800,,180,5.241379310344827
6413476,4,B00KBERQ8Y,OK,1437436800,,2,2.0
6413477,1,B00KBERQ8Y,Unwatchable- don't waste your money on something so poorly conceived as well as acted.,1425427200,,86,5.214285714285714
6413478,4,B00KBERQ8Y,"As a spy story, this film besides its entertainment value, raises doubts about the wisdom of the Baltic states being in the European Union. This is the theme of the film - the Russians bat as the bad guys of course, the Brits bat as the good guys, and Estonia is the ping pong ball. Its Third Man territory, though its not quite that simple. At times complex, at other times pure farce, this film takes us all over the tiny country of Estonia in search of the macguffin - Roger Harris - a missing M6 agent. Tilda, the hapless Brussels agent, does eventually find him, surprise surprise, by like North by NorthWest, the plot is just an excuse to have various episodes happen during the journey of discovery. In this film, some of these are quite funny, though the characters are dry. Anyway,I enjoyed it, it was different from the high-end bang-bang-your-dead stuff like Bond and Bourne.",1415750400,,886,4.613924050632911
8657302,4,B00KBERQ8Y,Suspenseful spy movie.,1529193600,,22,6.666666666666667
8657303,4,B00KBERQ8Y,I like this film it's good to see a film with an unashamed plot and story. Acting is okay and it's interesting to see such a film with obviously English actors filmed entirely in Estonia. Worth a watch.,1519516800,,202,4.342105263157895
8657304,4,B00KBERQ8Y,"not the best quality of film, but strong plot, some humor and women that were easy on the eyes, but cheap on props at times...Okay I liked it",1518825600,,141,4.071428571428571
8657305,1,B00KBERQ8Y,The only things I liked was Gert Estonian partner and the song at the end. Non of both names are in the movie description...,1514419200,,124,4.208333333333333
8657306,1,B00KBERQ8Y,Boring foreign film.,1513296000,,20,6.0
8657307,4,B00KBERQ8Y,"Rather slow, but a good plot. Four stars.",1512864000,,41,4.25
8657308,1,B00KBERQ8Y,"This film has no plausible plot, laughable dialogue, apparently no direction, and no logic whatsoever.  The plight of Estonia is a valid premise, but this film abuses it.",1511827200,,170,5.071428571428571
8657309,1,B00KBERQ8Y,The worst movie I have ever seen!!! If this movie could get a negative rating I would give it!!!,1511740800,,96,4.105263157894737
8657310,4,B00KBERQ8Y,"Some of the reviews belittling the acting, seem to miss the point.
Estonia is a beautiful country. Long battered and bruised by world
super-powers. The spirit of the inhabitants remain strong.
Geopolitical and social issues will always be of major concern.
To paraphrase a statement in the movie.
""If Estonia remains independent after 100 years there is hope""",1511740800,2,359,5.206896551724138
8657311,4,B00KBERQ8Y,"This movie is terrible.  Terrible plot, terrible acting, terrible dialogue, terrible costuming, terrible sets, terrible camera camera work.  It violates every principle of good script writing, acting, blocking, and film-making.  It is so terrible, we laughed for an entire hour and a half.  At first you will just want to turn it off, but stick it out, have another beer, and enjoy it's awfulness.  My favorite part was when the female Russian agent was threatening Tilda at gunpoint and had her finger behind the trigger, literally behind the trigger!  Or maybe it was the crowd of seven or eight unarmed Estonian women and children menaced the two MI - 6 agents and sent them running.  No, my favorite was when Tilda sprayed insect repellent into the face of the Russian agent until he fell out a window to his doom.  Maybe it was watching the two MI - 6 agents being chased by the morbidly obese Russian and the merely obese Russian with a limp. Anyway, spoiler alert, Estonia was left safe in hands of the younger generation of Amazonian strippers in platform shoes and tight leather pants.",1510531200,2,1094,4.781914893617022
