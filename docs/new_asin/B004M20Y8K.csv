8435425,4,B004M20Y8K,Guys Gone Wild shows us that texas does have bigger treats to snack on. Yes the guys on this dvd may not be the hottest but most have big long horns and most have no problem showing their booty. Keep in mind these are guys you would never see nude otherwise so just sit back and enjoy the skin show.,1438041600,,299,4.0

8435427,2,B004M20Y8K,"The ubiquitous off camera narrator girl is in Dallas, TX this time to cajole and lure college age boys into the GGW van to play with themselves on camera.  Unfortunately, the film featured the cutest guy they found in the first vignette but he refused to drop trou and audiences were forced to imagine what he looked like under the boxers.  The line up of men were disappointingly lacking. There was nothing inherently wrong with them per se; it's just that they could have been cuter.  I wouldn't have picked any of them up if I had seen them at a club. In that regard, I wouldn't have thrown them out of bed either. While watching past GGW videos, I usually mute it because the voice of the girl coaxing and cajoling the trade to take off their skivvies in annoying when I'm trying to focus on the visuals. But in this video, the girl seemed familiar enough for me to regard her as an ally. As she performed the requirements of what has to be the best job in the world, I realized her presence was a necessary evil that must be present in order for straight boys to feel comfortable being naked. Although a man's voice would have been hotter for the fantasy factor, his presence surely would have prevented any of the boys from feeling comfortable enough to play with their junk on camera.  I found myself feeling grateful to the narrator girl who I felt was doing her best to produce the same outcome, pardon the pun.
I appreciate the regional nuances of the different GGW videos as each place brings something slightly different to the parade of cock that gets pranced out in front of the camera. I have lived in Dallas, the site where this video was filmed and couldn't help thinking that  it would have been better if the GGW crew had scouted at gay bars such as the Brick or Crews Inn. Guys there are undeniably hotter than the peach fuzz parade featured in this video and would have made for better entertainment. I don't feel the boys in this video were cute enough to justify the $20 I spent on it.",1331683200,3,2008,4.416216216216216
8435428,2,B004M20Y8K,"I tend to stick with films that have a plot, however every now and then you just want to see a little more. This was one of those times. When I seen the cover photo for this DVD, I just HAD to have it! There are four guys in the photo, and three of them really caught my eye. Unfortunately only one of these guys even appears nude in the flick. He was of course the one I wasn't attracted to at all. One of them, although very good looking refused to undress for the camera and I don't recall the other two anywhere in this thing. They must have been edited out of everything except the cover photo. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!
The Guys Gone Wild bus has arrived at a club full of men in Houston Texas. Of all the eligable guys there, only about a half dozen or so of the least attractive ones were chosen to be interviewed in the bus while stroking their meat. Bigger in Texas??? These guys were barely larger than average, all of them were nervous which is to be expected, but I don't think there was a full erection anywhere in this film. The whole thing was very poorly done from beginning to end. The entire 56 minutes of this DVD consisted of the voice of a never seen female interviewer saying the same things to each guy who came aboard the bus. ""take your shirt off"", ""how big is it?"", ""show me your butt"" etc.. The female voice alone was enough to totally ruin this DVD for me. I was bored all the way through but continued watching in hopes of seeing some improvement and maybe some of the hot guys in the club which I would certainly have chosen to watch stroke their stuff. It never changed. One guy although very attractive had a tool that was badly curved. Too many not so attractive guys, very low budget and quality and that redundant female voice. I give this one 2 stars only because I did get to see some flesh, but all in all I was not at all impressed. Very deceiving cover photo and a lot of hype that simply wasn't delivered. Just a few straight men expressing how they hoped to impress all those women out there watching. They failed to realize this DVD will probably only be watched by a bunch of gay men. Gotcha guys!!! Don't waste your money or your time on this one.",1304294400,29,2187,4.23444976076555
