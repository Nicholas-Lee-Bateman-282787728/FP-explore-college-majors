960174,3,6305078599,"I usually try to avoid movies with titles so long that writing the name out on a piece of paper could cause carpal tunnel syndrome. But ""Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death"" was too quirky of a label to pass up. I probably would have watched this schlockfest eventually since one of the stars appearing in it is Adrienne Barbeau. This actress, if you aren't familiar with her, has turned up in some of the great B budget masterpieces of the last twenty-five years or so. You can see Barbeau in ""The Fog,"" for example, or ""Escape From New York."" She's a pretty lady, a good actress rarely given over to fits of ham handed acting who usually elevates whatever movie she decides to appear in. Well, nothing can really save ""Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death,"" not even Barbeau, but the movie does have a certain cheesy charm that could endear it to certain segments of the low budget crowd. Also turning up in this over the top film are Shannon Tweed and a pre-""Politically Incorrect"" Bill Maher, who must have signed on to do this picture when he noticed his residual checks from ""D.C. Cab"" were rapidly diminishing.
A threat with serious implications to the nation's avocado supply leads military and government leaders to seek the help of Dr. Margo Hunt (Tweed). They approach this professor because her academic work as a feminist makes her a natural to plunge into the deep jungles of California (?) to meet with the Piranha women, an ancient clan of cannibals who consume the male members of the tribe. Apparently, America could fall to the communist menace if cheap avocados aren't readily available on the market, or some such nonsense. Hunt agrees to go after the dean threatens to cut off her funding, taking along with her a bubble-headed Home Economics major named Bunny (Karen Mistal). The two women must employ a guide to lead them into the unforgiving jungle, a guide who is strong, knowledgeable, brave, and cool in stressful situations. Predictably, they choose Jim (Maher) for the job. He's anything but strong, knowledgeable, brave, or cool in stressful situations. Rather, Jim is a politically incorrect, testosterone driven guy who thinks feminism is a ridiculous product of the modern age. He's also largely helpless once he gets five feet outside the city. Can you see the endless potential for hilarious hijinks?
The three head out into the jungle and promptly get lost. Jim can't read a map to save his life, so the trio stumbles around in the wilderness for ages before encountering another human being. Along the way, Jim makes the move on Bunny, reminisces about his brief fling with Dr. Hunt, and argues against the merits of feminism. Not much happens until they meet a tribe of docile men, a clan that is completely subservient to women. Their sycophantic behavior outrages Jim, who proceeds to show these guys how to drink beer, approach women, and generally act like the slobs they really are. By the time Jim, Margo, and Bunny reach the Piranha women they discover even more surprises. It turns out that a colleague of Hunt's, a radical feminist named Dr. Kurtz (!) (Barbeau) who disappeared some time ago on an expedition, now rules over the tribe as their leader. The Piranhas lock Jim up for future sacrifice and offer Margo and Bunny membership in the tribe. Too, another tribe of women emerges as enemies of the Piranhas. It's all about as ridiculous as you could imagine, and the conclusion attains a level of sappiness that would make Walt Disney heave. Only the iron willed viewer used to such banality could watch ""Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death"" without losing IQ points in the process.
Actually, the performances of the principals aren't too bad. Tweed, known for making dozens of schlock films since the 1980s, plays Margo Hunt with an overweening sense of seriousness that fits the character. Maher, a stand up comedian by trade, gets all the ""best"" (I use this term carefully) lines as the archetypical male who can't use a map or admit that he's wrong. Mistal portrays Bunny competently in the stock 1980's dim bulb role pioneered by the likes of Judy Landers. Barbeau is just fun to watch. ""Cannibal Women"" is a cheap film, shot on a shoestring budget that stretches at the seams when the characters are supposed to be battling their way through the jungle or fighting wildlife. The biggest surprise here is that the filmmakers actually tried to inject a noteworthy theme as the central plot point, namely feminism and how it pertains to the glaring differences between men and women. It's all played for amusement, obviously, but sadly you'll find barely a belly laugh here. I think I cracked a smile when Jim taught the male tribe how to stand tall, but everything else fell flat.
The DVD version of the film isn't anything to write home about. You get a few trailers for other cheesy movies and that's about it. I guess they couldn't get Maher to sign on for a commentary track since he's too busy passing himself off as a pundit on the news channels. I think someone should call in the next time he's on a talk show and ask him about this movie. Who knows, maybe someone already has. In the meantime, give ""Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death"" a chance if you like over the top, spoofy movies that doesn't require too much effort in the brain department. It's a mindless, slightly amusing film with which to pass the time.",1086652800,,5420,4.7365079365079366

960176,5,6305078599,"This is one of my all time favorite movies.  It's a hilarious spoof on Heart of Darkness, and a B-movie all the way, down to the classically stereotyped characters and the low budget settings.  It pokes fun at feminism, academia, and stereotypical gender roles.
The basic plot line is that the whole eastern part of Southern California is a vast avocado jungle, inhabited by cannibalistic feminist ""natives"" who eat men with guacamole dip.  The US government claims to want to protect the ""free world's last avocado source"" by retaking the avocado jungle.  They recruit a feminist scholar from Spitzer College (actually set at UC Riverside) to make contact with the cannibal women.  On her mission she takes along a stereotyped ""girly"" girl, Bunny (who wears all pink, takes a curling iron, and has fantasies about being tied up with red licorice) and a bigoted but bumbling male chauvinist.  The result is a hilarious romp.  Academic types will love all the academic jokes: ""Your methodology is shabby!""
I agree with the other reviewers that the picture and sound quality is not great.  I've personally never been able to find a high quality version of this movie.  I think it just doesn't exist.  This is not the Matrix or some other high budget DVD.  In some ways, though, the sound and picture quality is kind of classic.  It very much goes along with the whole ""feel"" of the movie.  A B-movie through and through.

The picture is grainy, and tends to have the 'cross-hatching' artifacts of over compression.  The print itself had scratches that have been preserved for all time....how very sad.  Frankly the quality is comparable to a 2nd generation VHS copy...even the one at your local rental store is likely to be better. Oh; and I recall someone else mentioning that the DVD is Mono!

If the studio doesn't care enough to put some resources into releasing the DVD of this flick, why should they reap any further profit from it?",991180800,14,755,4.604477611940299

960319,2,6305078599,"A REVIEW BY A HETERO MALE:

Sure, the box cover has three hot ladies on it (some of them are known to show skin), and with a name like ""Cannibal women in the Avocado Jungle"", the viewer is certainly expecting a movie that fits the B-genre.

Alas, no.  Well, the budget and (horrible) production value certainly fall into the B-category, the plot line and other 'virtues' (cough)gratuitousnudity(cough) of the category are missing.

The plot is a bit of parody of ""Heart of Darkness"" (and Apocalypse Now) in that the protagonists go deep into the ""Avocado jungles of southern California"" to seek the fate of Dr. Kurtz, who went missing on an earlier expedition.

The movie lampoons extreme Feminism: Shannon Tweed play a stereotypical uptight Women's Studies professor (Margo Hunt),  who seems a caricature only until she meets Adrienne Barbeau's character (Dr. Kurtz), who is an more exaggerated, militant feminist.  The satire of Feminism would be typical in a lot of B-Movies, so the ready willingness it does this at first seems appropriate.  However, the plot betrays this:
1. ""Bunny"", an airhead who clearly doesn't belong among the intelligentsia of Dr. Kurtz/Margo Hunt, takes up the Feminist mantle by offering to join the cannibals and kill her first man.
2.  The expedition party comes across the males of the jungle, who are fearful of all women and domesticated to the point of ridiculousness: they throw tea parties and crochet their own clothing.
3.  After the teaser of nudity (censored in the Amazon streaming video) in the opening scenes...there's nothing.  Not even some sexy poses or anything at all even meant to titillate. The women wear tribal clothing, but nothing about the cinematography or the camera takes advantage of this fact.  In a B Movie/exploitation flick, you lose all credibility if you don't deliver those goods.
4.  Sacrificial men in the temple of the cannibal women are a reverse parody of 'typically objectified' women: intelligent, sensitive beefy hunks, who are nevertheless upset to be only valued for their meat (literally).

In the end, then, the movie honors sex-negative Feminism more than it lampoons it.  For the underlying messages and (especially) the stubborn refusal to add sex appeal to any part of the movie, I give it the low rating.  Not because honoring sex-negative Feminism in a movie is wrong, but because honoring sex-negative Feminism in THIS kind of movie (which typically honors sex-positive Feminism) is more than wrong....its a betrayal.",1469923200,8,2505,5.102941176470588

Cons: Amazon has seen fit to blur the short early scenes with naked breasts. The pop feminism references were seriously dated at the time this was filmed - Shere Hite published The Hite Report in two decades earlier than this movie, and intervening years have only dated them further. The use of what is clearly an avocado orchard, with trees planted in straight lines make it as hard to suspend disbelief to imagine them as a jungle as it is to imagine a wild jungle covering the vast majority of inland southern California, or even the strategic military need for avocados in the first place. Bill Maher delivers his lines as woodenly as possible. Neither Adrienne Barbeau and Shannon Tweed have they the ability to battle with Star Trek axes in any manner, nor can they fence to save their lives (and one of them literally fails to do so, to the benefit of the piranhas). It has all the production values of a student film, and locating much of it at a college enhances the effect.

961162,5,6305078599,"This is a surprisingly difficult movie to rate, if the rating is supposed to be used as a serious measurement of the overall movie's quality on all levels.  I decided to take the easy way out and give it five stars...wait, wait, wait:  let me explain.

I chose to watch this movie because of a discussion I had with someone about Shannon Tweed.  It wasn't much of a discussion, but I decided to look to see if any of her old movies were on Amazon streaming: I would NEVER have paid to see one.  I knew that as an actress she was all about wonderful boobs and a great posterior and little else, but years before I had seen a film of hers that actually had some decent dialog and a not-so-bad story.

When I read the title and other info about ""Canibal Women in the Avocado Jungle"" I just had to see it. I figured it was either a Class D-minus movie from her early days, filled with females flouncing and bouncing across the screen with the occasional faux sex scene with very well built but obviously gay guys thrown in, or something very, very strange without a niche to plop it in during a review.

What Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle is, is not so subtle satire and some of it is really pretty GOOD satire also.  Period satire harkening back to the days when Gloria Steinem and the rest of the screaming liberalizing, bra-burning women were getting major press and women were just beginning to try to reach up, let alone break the glass ceiling.

SHannon Tweed is an anthropologist who gets tasked to go into the Avocado Jungle of Southern California to search for a famous missing female anthropologist.  Of course everyone knows that all of southern California is a vast avocado plantation, the western slopes of the Hollywood Hills slipperily slathered with guacomole, so the movie's premise wasn't much of a stretch.  Accompanied by the movies token blonde bimbo...a college sophomore with the requisite big boobs and great ass...anthropologist /Tweed and the odd male guide, in his mind along, himself a former lover of Tweed/anthropologist venture into the avocado jungle which looks oddly like some of the old exterior shots from Lone Ranger tv episodes.

Of course they find the Cannibal Women.  It turns out there are groups of them, one of which is led by the famous missing anthropologist. Throughout the movie there are clever one-liners that slap histerically at certain aspects of the women's liberation movement. Not in anger, just in fun. For instance, on first meeting the bow and arrow spear carrying cannibal women, Shannon Tweed/anthropologist shows absolutely no fear and immediately shows them her N.O.W. membership card.

At first unbelieving, then more and more drawn in wondering what the next zinger might be, when the characters described Bakersfield as essentially one of the last outposts of civilization despite its crudity, I was hooked.

If you are looking for a typical ex-Playboy Bunny-struts-her-stuff movie, don't watch this one. Oh, sure, there is a some nice booty to be mined in the old celluloid frames and it is not at all unenjoyable.  But watch this one for the satire, camp humor and, well, just for the fun of it.

You will probably give it no stars, and if you do, it might mean you are entirely too serious about a lot of things.",1386028800,3,3284,4.723292469352014

Like Killer Tomatoes and Strangelove, Cannibal Women rises above the B movie field with its spot-on singular gestalt to be one-of-a-kind -- maybe the best ""B movie"" of all for me -- showing the only partial validity of such ratings.

Compare the scene in which the three explorers stand on a hill and see San Bernardino in the distance, with the scene in ""Star Wars"" where they see the city of Mos Isle in the distance.

The sword-fight in the end with the one in ""Star Wars"".

Goofs are many, but the more memorable one is when they needed to build a boat to travel down a river. After the boat is built, it can clearly be seen to be a manufactured rowboat. And where did its motor come from?

Starring Adrienne Barbeau (Escape From New York) as the leader of the Piranha Women the film is a hoot.  The movie is soaking in humor.  For example the savages are said to speak a primitive language.  French, in other words.  And the jungle boat ride is compared to the Disney one (even with a hippo attack).

From Shannon collecting all she needs for the journey, selecting her notepads to deciding which bullets to take, to Bill trying to teach a tribe of Donahues how to be REAL MEN, with a beer scene right out of 2001, there is no limit to the funniness and a few adult jokes are placed here and there.  The fight between Shannon and Barbeau COULD have been better - they don't know how to fence at all.

There is a message buried inside the silliness, about male and female relationships, but that's not allowed to screw up the comedy.  To counter the weak serious theme there is some brief nudity, at the beginning, when the amazons are having a swim in the river and both Tweed and Mistal look good in the tight skins the Piranha women wear.  Mistal does wear a lot of pink outfits, mostly what look like swimsuits, which is a pleasure to see.  So it's all good, clean, adult fun!  Great for a 90 minute flick.  Get it used or new.",1154217600,23,1785,4.331325301204819

The film is not quite as silly and funny as the ""tomatoes"" series, but allows for some good laughs poking fun at ""the war between the sexes"" as a feminist professor, a ""bimbo"" and a washed-out ""macho"" penetrate the avocado jungle (just South-East of San Diego) to look for a tribe of cannibal women. Good for co-ed viewing as stereotypes for feminists and ""machos"" are taken apart in a humourous way.

Since the moment I caught it on a Comedy Channel Saturday afternoon T&A (I don't think I have to explain that) movie back in the early '90's, I've been a huge fan.  I know it's campy, but it is great fun.  I think it's because the actors know it's silly, but they play it seriously. There are so many great lines, ""I'd bet you'd like to eat me right now, Dr. Hunt!"" and Jim - ""and ever since then, I crawled into a whiskey bottle and..."" Margo - ""Oh, Jim, not the whiskey bottle again!"", you'd be hard pressed not to laugh out loud or at least giggle and smirk at the goofiness.  My favorite scene is Margo getting her ""supplies"" to go into the jungle.  Classic!  Buy it!  You'll want to see it again!",1127952000,6,805,4.222222222222222
961253,5,6305078599,"Every so often a film is made that somehow manages to wed strong feminist concepts with genuine entertainment.  Writer/Director J.F. lawton makes little attempt to dissemble where his inspiration comes from, and this work can also be seen as an homage to pro-women leaders past and present.

Lawson also comments heavily on themes of protectionism and globalization, with his sybolic avocado representing the products of the third world that, although carrying high prices in first world markets, remit little of their end-user prices to the often subsistence-level existence of the of the agrarian communities that produce those products.

The portrayal of 'big business' in the film as not caring about 'cannibal women' (the indiginous population) and just caring about profits & product (the avocadoes) would likely be a turn off to most libertarians and free-markets minded people.  However, Lawton manages to pull off a supremely leftist work in a way that can be readily enjoyed by most who watch it.  Like ""Dr. Strangelove"" people from all sides of the debate can take something positive away.

This is easily the best edutainment political commentary film of 1989.",1117756800,5,1172,5.274193548387097

961255,5,6305078599,"Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle ...It's a long cheesy title on a movie with an equally cheesy premise. That's what makes this movie so much fun to watch. I have a soft spot for B-movies. The strong effort by the actors often makes them superior to the ""A"" movies Hollywood produces.

Cannibal Women Features Shannon Tweed as a professor of feminist studies enlisted by the government to go into the ""Avocado Jungle"" to deal with the Cannibal women so the United States can have a steady supply of Avocados. It seems the army has sent in soldiers and all was left of them were their dog tags. The women with tore the men into strips and ate them with guacamole dip! Accompanying the professor on this dangerous mission is valley girl Bunny and a sexist guide who can't read a map played by Bill Maher Before he became a talk show host on ""Politically Incorrect"". On their journey in the Avocado jungle the professor debates feminist theory with the sexist guide. These arguments are hilarious! In the jungle they run into some sensitive guys who Maher tries to ""man up"" with disastrous results. Afterward they're captured by the Cannibal women who have had their tribe taken over by a radical feminist. Adrienne Barbeau is a hoot as the Feminist professor who takes over the tribe and puts our group of explorers in peril. I won't give the rest away the climax of this movie is TOO good to be spoiled.

The plot is ridiculous, and the actors know it. They play it straight anyway and their excellent performances make this movie so good. In the face of a cheesy script poor production values, a low budget and skimpy costumes they make it work. I highly recommend you get this movie and a bowl of popcorn on Saturday night. Cannibal Women is a B-movie that scores all A's with me.",1104969600,13,1784,4.571875

Slapping at each others weapons (obviously not choriographed) while delivering the corniest lines of the movie. You'll laugh so hard you'll almost forget the how hard you were laughing before this scene! All you'll have left to do is decide whether to have clam dip or guacamole dip while you watch it again! And all the rest of us need are some really good feminists cooking classes!

961258,5,6305078599,"This movie was hysterical.  This was the ""perfect"" find.  As we watch over and over again films like Tommy Boy and Airplane!, we tend to think that perhaps that is all that there is to offer from comedy. Well, I am here to shout that you would be wrong.  I suggest that everyone that takes the time to read this review should go out to the movie store and watch a film that always scared them.  I do not mean a horror film, but I mean a movie that just made you say out loud, ""I am never going to rent this film"".  Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death would have been my choice.  Just by looking at the DVD cover art, this would not have been a film I would have wanted to jump up and down to see, but now after seeing it I have gained a new found appreciation for older comedies.

The 80s were overburdened by ""big-budget"" comedies.  Those that carried big named comedians, but there was also a few that slipped through the cracks. In 1989, this film was one of those. This was a very sharp minded film with a great cast and a flawless script.  Now, don't get me wrong, this was no Vanilla Sky, but it did take a very heated topic at the time and create a comedy that didn't denounce the issues.

This was, and will remain, a story about feminism. I asked Jen, my wife and feminist, if this film was ever shown in any of her graduate or undergraduate classes, and she replied ... sadly, ""no"".  It should have been. This film demonstrates what feminists are striving for in the form of film.  I loved this film, and so did my wife.

I suggest this to anyone out there that is looking for that perfect ""campy"" movie that will make you laugh, never use your mind, and create a strong point for feminism!!

7882177,5,6305078599,"This is an updated version of Joseph Conrad's ""Hart of Darkness"" Some times it is necessary to place stories in different context so people can relate to them. Look how they changed ""Romeo and Juliet"" into ""West Side Story"". Once before they tried to convert ""Hart of Darkness."" i.e. ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979). However you can see how this version has more redeeming social value. The DVD version allows equal billing with the avocados. You need to watch it once for the story and again to pick up the nuances. Now a chance to go where no man has gone before (and return)

Looks like the U.S. strategic avocado supply is being threatened. You can locate the region on older maps that show where the Mohave Desert was. Seems that there is a bunch of wild native California women being lead by a renegade scientist Dr. Kurtz (Adrienne Barbeau.) They have the munchies for male avocado pickers. Is this a fact or is someone dumping Avocados off the coast?

Watch as the daring trio of Dr. Margo Hunt (Shannon Tweed), Jim (Bill Maher), and Bunny (Karen Mistal) go up the river to investigate. And do not over look the tribe of Donahues.
