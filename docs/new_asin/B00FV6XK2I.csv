6031642,5,B00FV6XK2I,"This documentary is just what I needed to educate people about the sport I love.  Great words of wisdom from long time and newbie weightlifting professionals and athletes.  Also, great footage of good lifts being performed over and over - I think my snatch improved just by watching!",1384300800,,283,4.875
6031643,5,B00FV6XK2I,"Most of my workouts have some components of weightlifting and it is the sport I participate in the most regularly; however, this story isn't just for the weightlifter. This is a great story about people who just love what they do and will keep doing it even if they have to pay for it. It seems so much of what we spend our time with are things with short-term goals and rewards. This video shows what can happen when you put your time in not to get a pay off, but because you truly believe in what you are doing.",1384300800,2,513,4.14
6031644,5,B00FV6XK2I,"This documentary serves as yet another revolutionary milestone in Greg Everett and the entire catalyst athletic team's pursuit to further the sport of olympic weightlifting.  If you're anything like me, you'll get goosebumps and teary eyed just by watching the trailer.  A must watch for anyone who remotely considers themselves an athlete of the iron.",1384300800,,352,5.381818181818182
6031645,5,B00FV6XK2I,Terrific Work and Effort put into this film. This is a must see for those athletes and coaches who are fans of Olympic Weightlifting,1384300800,,132,4.541666666666667
6031646,5,B00FV6XK2I,"This documentary is hopefully the first of many to cover the sport of weightlifting in the USA. Greg Everett does a nice job profiling some of the pioneering coaches and facilities of American weightlifting, but it must be said he focuses on West Coast coaches, gyms, lifters in this film and excludes much of the East Coast history with the exception of Bob Hoffman and York Barbell who are mentioned occasionally. The documentary is at its best when direct quotes from the lifters and coaches acknowledging the challenges and struggles of the sport are overlaid over excellent lifting footage. This is a great initial effort by Greg Everett and a good introduction to this little-known sport in the US.",1384300800,,704,4.92436974789916
6031647,5,B00FV6XK2I,Seeing the grit and determination of those involved in the sport is very motivating and helped me draw parallels to my own sport. But the depth of the film also shows how unique the sport is and the individual stories that the sport is built on. More sports need someone to take such a detailed look in the mirror as Greg Everett has done with this film.,1384300800,,354,4.298507462686567
6031648,5,B00FV6XK2I,"Well worth a look for anyone who is into Weightlifting (or thinks they might want to know more).  I learned a great deal about Weightlifting form this documentary, and I went in thinking I had a good general  understanding!  Take a look.  You will not be disappointed.",1384300800,,268,4.638297872340425
6031649,5,B00FV6XK2I,"Great film about the state of USA weightlifting. Very Informative, and is a must see for anyone interested in weightlifting.",1384300800,,124,5.25
6031650,5,B00FV6XK2I,"Anyone with a cursory knowledge of the sport of weightlifting will really enjoy this film.  The first thing I wanted to do after being mesmerized by people snatching, cleaning and jerking for 2 hours was hit the gym.  The interviews were all very interesting and for those that participate in the sport, you walk away from the film with the feeling that you're a part of an underground movement.  If you're a weightlifter, this is a 5 star film for sure.",1384300800,2,454,4.580246913580247
6031651,3,B00FV6XK2I,"So I enjoyed parts of this documentary, and since I rented it I will say it was worth the 2.99 I spent on it. That said though if I had purchased it I would be rather upset. The majority of this film was just voice over from interview subjects while athletes went about training on screen. For a documentary that complains a great deal about an education gap regarding weightlifting, you did a poor job of actually educating people. This documentary doesn't even have the normally obligatory :30 'this is a snatch, this is a C&J' section. I just think this could have gone so much farther than it did. For a sport that I know is exciting both to participate in and to watch this was a fairly flat film. Also the closing argument of 'either go all in or get out of weightlifting' is going to get people out of weightlifting. You want to bring people into the sport? Well the vast majority won't be competitive at anything other than the local level, and you've basically told them if they're not willing to forgo a ton of other things it's a waste of time. Poor choice.",1462060800,2,1068,4.398989898989899
6031652,4,B00FV6XK2I,great movie.  gets a little slow in the middle but worth watching if you are interested in learning more about the American Weightlifting history and future.  This is NOT a instructional video so do not rent/buy if you are looking for Olympic weightlifting instruction.,1455321600,,269,5.090909090909091
6031653,4,B00FV6XK2I,"As someone who enjoys strength sports, I've wondered why it is that Olympic lifting is not more popular in the U.S.  This answers aspects of that question, but is really a lot longer than it needs to be.  It also focuses almost exclusively on programs and personalities in California, which is where Greg Everett owns a gym.  I would have liked to see what is going on in other parts of the country.  Still, it provides some insight into why such a globally popular sport remains so limited in popularity in a country that loves sports, and the films is well done.",1450224000,,564,4.5
6031654,5,B00FV6XK2I,"Excellent movie, I could watch it more than once! Olympic lifting is an amazing sport and this is a great movie.",1449187200,,112,4.380952380952381

6031658,1,B00FV6XK2I,I love Olympic Weightlifting and hate this documentary. Just people whining about the state of Olympic Weightlifting in the USA.  Very little actual Olympic Weightlifting.  Mostly just video interviews of people complaining/,1443312000,2,224,5.96875
6031659,5,B00FV6XK2I,Love that this movie is out there! My husband and I are always trying to promote the sport and the community and this movie is the best reference point!,1441152000,,152,4.275862068965517
6031660,2,B00FV6XK2I,"To preface, I enjoy sports documentaries but this was Kind of a snooze. Could've been half as long as it seemed like they talked about the same handful of topics over and over again.",1440633600,,182,4.382352941176471
6031661,5,B00FV6XK2I,I enjoyed this documentary very much.  I felt that it hit on the struggle of weightlifters in the USA.  This is a great film for anyone interested in the sport of weightlifting.,1438819200,,177,4.5
6031662,5,B00FV6XK2I,if you're a weightlifter you need to see this. Great history lesson from the giants of American weightlifting and a guide to the future of American weightlifting. Find a young person and get them lifting.,1438819200,,204,4.857142857142857
6031663,2,B00FV6XK2I,"Olympic weightlifting is something I enjoy doing, watching, reading about, hearing about, discussing, etc. However, this documentary was a massive letdown. I honestly could not finish watching this. This was the most depressing representation of our weightlifting community I could have imagined. The whole time you get the tone that all the US can do is cry about why we aren't as good as other countries, and finding the positives is like an I Spy book.
The footage of actual weightlifting was pretty scarce, and a lot of it was just regulars at a couple popular gyms doing warm up lifts. I didn't really pay to watch someone do reps of 85lb power snatches off blocks...Sure, the interviews were with some very respected people within the community like Jim Schultz... But to be honest, I couldn't stand listening to the erratic babbling of Mr. Schultz. His stories of training Olympians are great, but then he begins to complain about how we don't have enough talent in weightlifting because of other sports and it goes south very quickly.
70% of what is said in this film is consistently reiterated and drilled into you and that is: 'Poor us, why can't weightlifting be as popular as football, why can't we be a big sport, none of us get paid enough, we don't have the money for big gyms, we can't pay our athletes enough so no one wants to take us seriously as a sport...'

Take it or leave it, this is my honest review. Extremely negative vibe from this film to be honest, bummed me out. I was excited to see some weightlifting and maybe where the future lies for this sport, but it was really just a bunch of old names in the game talking about how much things suck.",1438560000,8,1673,4.576666666666667
6031664,3,B00FV6XK2I,"good film. you will hear the same story from almost every coach on here though, ""we don't have the funding or support like big professional sports"". cry me a river. you do it for the love, not the money",1438128000,,202,4.205128205128205
6031665,5,B00FV6XK2I,Good s***. Need more docs like this,1437868800,,35,4.142857142857143
6031666,1,B00FV6XK2I,I power lift and olympic lift 4 times a week. I got exposed to olympic lifting through CrossFit and was hoping to learn a little more about olympic lifting by watching this film.  Instead it was entirely people whining about how olympic lifting is a second class sport in the US and how other countries  olympic lifting programs use PEDs.  There wasn't even any footage of people who looked like they were in shape doing lifts.  If olympic lifting wants respect they won't get it by whining.,1437868800,,491,4.609195402298851
6031667,2,B00FV6XK2I,meh.. Not nearly as good as Lift the World,1436400000,,42,3.7777777777777777
6031668,5,B00FV6XK2I,"As someone who enjoys weight lifting and fitness, this film provided a view into a sport that isn't greatly publicized in the U.S. Thanks Greg and crew for putting this together.",1435276800,,178,4.774193548387097
6031669,3,B00FV6XK2I,"Ok, this IS an excellent documentary on the history/perspective of Americans in the sport of weightlifting.  It's long though, and there is a lot of talking, which, I find extended talking one of the most difficult things to remain attentive to.  I actually nodded off a few times (my butt is kicked from my training) but I was interested enough in the subject matter that it pulled me right back in.  It's better than the ""Lift the World"" documentary I just watched too...",1431820800,,473,4.674698795180723
6031670,4,B00FV6XK2I,Good work Greg E. & company!!,1431043200,,29,4.0
6031671,2,B00FV6XK2I,"I've really been getting back into Oly lifting lately and was thinking I would like this more than I did.  Was pretty slow paced.  Seemed like half the movie was the narrator talking over a very long shot of the same 5 people lifting while complaining about how America isn't into oly lifting, complaining about how everyone else uses roids, and complaining about how much more money they get.  Watch Lift the World on youtube for free instead.",1430956800,5,444,4.666666666666667
6031672,5,B00FV6XK2I,A very educational and inspirational movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed learning the background of weightlifting here in America as well as learning more about some of the people who have instrumental in its development.  I thought this was a well done film and I would highly recommend it form anyone wanting to learn more about the background of the sport and some of the challenges that it faces.,1429315200,,393,4.850746268656716
6031673,5,B00FV6XK2I,Very well done. Great topic.,1429142400,,28,4.8

6031675,4,B00FV6XK2I,Great documentary well worth watching if you are interested in Olympic weightlifting and its history in the states,1428710400,,114,5.388888888888889
6031676,5,B00FV6XK2I,eye opening documentary about an amazing sport,1428624000,,46,5.714285714285714
6031677,5,B00FV6XK2I,I've come into Olympic Weightlifting recently via Crossfit.  The different perspectives from veterans are insightful and educational.  I've purchased the digital as well as the DVD.  Well worth the watch as well for your collection.,1428537600,,232,5.571428571428571
6031678,5,B00FV6XK2I,"There were so many incredible stories told in this movie and hearing them from the legendary coaches was really amazing. I loved the heartfelt stories and advice from the lifters too especially about training your mental game just as hard as your other training in the gym. Sometimes that fear of the number creeps in and I need to shove it out. Greg is right. It isn't about facilities or the equipment. It is about the atmosphere, and it is about the spirit.  Totally loved this movie!!",1428537600,,488,4.609195402298851
6031679,5,B00FV6XK2I,"Having personally Gone to Coach Burgeners for training in 2000. I thought this DVD was Awesome! Mike Burgener was the  most Giving man I have ever met in any of the lifting sports.. Not only is Mike a wealth of knowledge  , He is also very passionate . Don't go to Mikes unless you are ready to put out 100% effort. He will tell you in short order to give your all or don't waste his or your time. The Environment at Mikes is one of everyone supporting each other . Striving to make a new PR. You don't get to rest on your Laurels there. One gets a few minutes to enjoy ther accomplishment and then its time to add  more weight. Although I have never met the Film Maker personally, I feel connected to him since we also stood in that 2 car garage in Bonsal under Coach B.s  watchful eye. I though the Film maker did a great job of Conveying  the passion  for the 2 lifts, Its Sad that we in the United states don't give the lifts there due compared to Europe and Asia. I think the Film maker got that point across  rather well. I wish there was more support  for the young athlete in this country. I'm thankful that a lot  of interest has been garnered for the Snatck and C+J  because of Crossfits popularity. I would like to see more people actually devote there full time to the 2 lifts exclusively . I think Greg touches on all these points  nicelyl in this fine Documentary  .",1428537600,,1380,4.1856060606060606
6031680,5,B00FV6XK2I,"This is incredible.  It's a great synopsis of a sport that has gone by the wayside in this country.  You don't have to be a weightlifter to enjoy the historical aspect of this film.  I have been doing CrossFit for about a year now, and about 5 months ago, my coach, who loves weightlifting encouraged me to join his barbell club and turned me on to catalystathletics.com where I discovered Greg Everett.  Amazing interviews with guys like Mike Burgener and John Thrush.  Sooooo good.
If you do CrossFit,you should watch this.  I promise you'll be inspired to up your game on the olympic lifts.  And if you get good at those, they will pull the rest of your performance up for sure.  Anyways, buy, rent, have a viewing party, whatever.  Watch this movie.  It's great.",1428537600,,766,4.607407407407408
6031681,5,B00FV6XK2I,"Given that this was an amateur production I was not expecting much.  I was pleasantly surprised.  A well done documentary and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I wish Greg had a bigger budget so he could have interviewed coaches from all over the US about the growth of this great sport.  Here's to looking forward to a ""Part 2.""",1428537600,,320,4.482758620689655
6031682,4,B00FV6XK2I,Very informative and interesting documentary. Especially if you're into weightlifting. It was a little slow and boring at times. It went pretty deep into the history of weightlifting in America. I would've liked to see them get more into where weightlifting is now and the up and coming crop of new weightlifters. Definitely worth a watch if you like weightlifting.,1428537600,,365,5.1
6031683,5,B00FV6XK2I,All around great film. Really shows the obscurity of such an amazing sport in this country. You can really see the passion Greg has for this sport. Highly recommended even if you are not a weightlifter,1428537600,,201,4.611111111111111
6031684,5,B00FV6XK2I,"Just bought American Weightlifting. A great production from Greg and his team, it just makes you want to get on the platform and lift!!!!
I will recommend this to anyone and everyone, awesome!!!!!",1428537600,,196,4.96969696969697
6031685,5,B00FV6XK2I,Good documentary in weightlifting in the USA. Definitely worth watching if you're at all interested in the sport or if you want to know more about it.,1428537600,,150,4.592592592592593

Id like to see a sequel detailing the recent rise in weightlifting in North America.",1428537600,,96,5.0
6031687,5,B00FV6XK2I,"Greg Everett does a great job conveying the realities of weightlifting in the US, as bleak as some may be. I would love to see another one of these in a year or two to show how the sport has grown. I know it's exploding here in Wisconsin. I have a meet in a couple weeks that filled up months ago with 120 lifters, the biggest meet in state history. Thanks again for the informative and engaging documentary, and for all that you guys do for the sport.",1428537600,,452,4.1477272727272725
6031688,5,B00FV6XK2I,"Some people have issue with the fact that a topic covered in this documentary is the lack of comparable national support that other countries may have. I understand that, but the history lessons of the sport in America, to me, where far more prevalent and kept me interested and entertained. I think this is a good documentary to help grow some interest in the sport itself, beyond just learning then movements. I thoroughly enjoy it, and would recommend watching it if you are interested in the culture of weightlifting in America.",1428537600,,532,4.857142857142857
6031689,4,B00FV6XK2I,"Informative and inspirational look at the state of affairs in the sport of weightlifting. No sugar-coating, no exaggerations, just an honest assessment of the sport and its current place in the pantheon of American sport. The film explores the passion the athletes and coaches have for the sport, their origins, and their hope.",1428537600,,327,5.188679245283019
6031690,5,B00FV6XK2I,"American Weightlifting is a great addition to the weightlifting community. Not many, if any, have set out to produce a weightlifting movie. The movie especially focuses on the US. I especially enjoyed learning about weightlifting from Greg's perspective and other coaches he respects. My only comment here is that I would have loved to know more about York Barbell and weightlifting on the East coast. Being from the Mid-West, I felt as though the film implied that weightlifting in the US started out West, but I'm sure this was not the producers intention. I'm positive that Greg was making good use of the resources he has and the people he knows well.

The loose quote the resonates with me is that we (the weightlifting community) is responsible for the fate of our sport. I believe this to be spot and I bet this is something that we can all agree with. Thanks for making this movie (Greg and all parties involved). This one will be added to my library, right next to your two weightlifting books!",1428537600,,1003,4.698863636363637
6031691,4,B00FV6XK2I,"Neat documentary, and as the title says it talks uniquely about American Weightlifting as a sport and it's growth/support throughout the years.  Definitely could have used more material and information for the length of the video.",1428537600,,230,5.388888888888889

6031694,3,B00FV6XK2I,"Mr. Everett touches on a couple key issues with oly lifting... over, and over, and over. I like the subject matter, so I gave it 3 stars. Unfourtunately the content could have been conveyed in 20 minutes. Seriously 10 minutes of oly pros whining that the sport isn't as lucrative as the NFL.  If you enjoy olympic lifting give it a peek.",1426032000,8,337,4.435483870967742
6031695,1,B00FV6XK2I,Worst documentary about weightlifting ever. All they do is cry about how few people care or how few people are registered. It's not positive and basically a Sarah McLachlan commercial minus the animals.,1425945600,2,202,5.151515151515151

6031698,5,B00FV6XK2I,"As a weightlifting enthusiast, I've been waiting for a comprehensive and compelling documentary on American oly lifting.  The background research was extensive and the in depth interviews and on location training footage were fascinating.  The underdog perspective was a touch of genius that personifies the iron game in this country- underrepresented, underappreciated, and seemingly on the ropes.  But as you get to know the key players you find yourself filled with hope that the grit and determination demonstrated by this core group of die-hards is enough to turn the sport around in America.  And, if we do, it will be largely because of the folks chronicled in this documentary.  This is an absolute must for anyone who has ever gabbed a bar and had the courage to 'go under.'",1403568000,,783,5.038759689922481
6031699,5,B00FV6XK2I,This is the most dedication that I have ever seen come from a sport. The American Weightlifting Documentary makes you feel and love and pain that these athletes have committed not only to their life but the many lives of others. I am ending week three of the Catalyst Athletics Starter Program (cannot wait to start week four) and feel that I am a much better person for trying something that so many others have not.

I am currently learning the classic lifts on my own and its great.  Your book, and videos have helped tremendously.  By profession I an emergency medicine physician and Olympic lifting helps prepare me for that work, believe or not.  You have to be ready for any thing, you have to perform many complex tasks in quick succession, and be accurate.  That is how I see Olympic lifts as well.",1394150400,,652,4.295081967213115

While this documentary does leave out several big name coaches and athletes it never the less is interesting, honest, and possibly one of the most important documents about American Weightlifting ever produced. Props to Greg Everett for putting something like this together on his own, for the love of the sport, doing in my opinion more for USAW than USAW does for USAW.

A must watch for fans of weightlifting, Olympic sports and American athletes.",1392336000,,574,4.979166666666667

Needless to say from my rating that I was disappointed. To begin with I know this was done on a limited budget by amateur filmmaker, however my major criticism is I did not learn much more than I already knew.  The movie did not really expound on the history of the sport or the top American lifters. Moreover, I was surprised about the people who were not in the movie. Even I am familiar with names like John Broz and Glenn Pendlay. Lastly, what really lost me was showing footage of the same lifters over and over.",1390694400,,644,4.366666666666666

Left out a lot of good information like Jon North, Pendlay, etc. If more time was taken to do this, it could have been a great documentary but missed a lot of good interviews and should have had more diversity in who was lifting, saw the same 5 catalyst athletics lift the majority of the 2hours, got old quick.",1387065600,5,415,4.594594594594595
6031708,5,B00FV6XK2I,"In the sixties I used weight-lifting toward success in high school football --- resulting in a few scholarship offers --- but essentially forgot about it until about two years ago when an old high school classmate, who stayed with it all those intervening years, re-introduced me. My experience the past two years with weight-lifting (such as possible at my age, late sixties: no squat snatches, for example) and watching ""American Weightlifting: The Documentary"" has persuaded me that  Olympic weight-lifting should have a status equal to that of wresting programs at high schools and colleges.

If I have any quibbles about the documentary it would be that I would like to have heard a bit more from ordinary lifters as to their motivation.  I would also have wished for some attention to stars (such as they are) in the senior/masters ranks.  My friend, who kept up with his weight-lifting, and is American Masters champion in the 65-70 age bracket in one of the lighter weight brackets, adds his comments about the documentary:

""I agree that it would be good to have more ordinary lifters in the DVD as well as a more simple description of the lifts at the beginning for first time viewers trying to learn about the sport. Also, I would like to have seen a USA history of the sport presented, as we were number one back in the 40's and 50's with Tommy Kono, Norbert Schemansky, Isaac Berger, etc.  I remember when I first saw pictures of the lifts in Strength and Health magazine in 1959, I didn't realize how the lifts were exactly done.""

""American Weightlifting"" is a superlative documentary, though, in any case.",1386979200,,1621,4.809352517985611
6031709,5,B00FV6XK2I,I'm so happy that someone finally decided to do a documentary about weightlifting in America. I fel in love with the sport a little over 2 years ago and since then have been looking to learn more about the history of the sport in the American soil. Thanks to Greg I have been able to learn much more than just that. This is truly an inspiring documentary.,1386460800,,355,4.313432835820896

I am one who learned about Olympic Weightlifting lifting later in my life through CrossFit, but have developed a passion for it separate from CrossFit.

The director's passion for the sport could only be outdone by some of the interviewees that have been in the sport for many decades.  Lots of truthful explanations (not excuses) for the state of weightlifting in the USA.  I wonder if the run time was so long strictly to give some of these interviewees equal time.  Also, the film was missing a real call to action.  Very unclear as to what I was supposed to take away from the film.  If it was strictly a ""state of the sport"" documentary, then I am unsure why the film was missing some of the current biggest names in the sport.

The passion about the sport is evident in a great documentary by an authentic, dedicated Strength Coach, Greg Everett.  The movie is extremely insightful about an amazing, but struggling sport.  Every strength coach and athlete in the movie did an exceptional job to share their passion about struggles of the sport.  I found it was captivating and inspiring as a weight lifter and coach, but the real beauty of the movie is how it will help educate and inspire anyone who watches it, whether actively involved in the sport or not.  It's straightforward and brutally honest.
Very well done with some of the top names in American Weightlifting.

I'm new to the sport of weightlifting, so I wanted to find out a bit more about the sport. This documentary fits the bill! It's 2-hour run time is filled with stories and insight from coaches and athletes and never gets dry or redundant. Of course, there is plenty of footage of athletes training and performing the lifts and as others have said, makes you want to head to the gym right after viewing.

""American Weightlifting"" will definitely be getting multiple views from me and I highly recommend it to those who are curious about weightlifting!",1386028800,,788,5.053846153846154

6031719,4,B00FV6XK2I,"I certainly enjoyed the movie and but I think there are a number of things that kept me from rating it higher.

I think the history and explanation of what the lifts are would make it more accessible for a non lifter.  I was watching it with my girlfriend, and I had to stop the movie to show her some you tube videos of what a clean and jerk/snatch were. It mentions that those were the lifts that make up the sport, but it never explicitly identifies them.  Yes they are shown multiple times in the movie, but without prior knowledge someone may not know which one was which.  A description of lifts as well as the rules that qualify a lift to be successful would have been helpful.

I think there was too much time spent complaining about why US weightlifting was not as successful as it used to be.  I would have much preferred to see more current athletes/Olympians and how well they are doing internationally.  Footage of some more lifting teams would have been nice to see as well. I forget the young man's name at the moment, but I really enjoyed the part where it showed him competing at nationals(?).  It was exciting to see his coach get fired up and you could tell how proud he felt after making that last lift.

The narrative was good, Greg's voice had great tone and speech quality.  The narrative seemed a bit random and disorganized at times, but not too bad overall.

I have watched it a few times and I'm glad to say it is something I will watch multiple times throughout the years.",1385942400,,1500,4.379061371841155

6031727,1,B00FV6XK2I,. I couldn't even finish the movie. It's beyond boring will no real focus. Greg only talks to coaches in California and most of the footage is of his lifters. The movie is mostly dedicated to his team and has no scope on the whole of american weightlifting. A lot of the interviews have a lot of footage that should have been edited out.

They love the sport and it means so much more to them than success on the platform. It's a way of life and they're passionate about it. Second, the movie was made on basically no budget, with no help from really anyone. The fact that this movie even exists is inspiring. And the fact that it's good is even more inspiring!

A few months ago I became a personal trainer on the side for fun and to supplement my income. I did a lot of research on exercises and that it when I found and became truly interested I.

However I have scene some documentary lifts about the various sports before such as EMJFox on youtube and while shorter they were great. This was pretty much just shot in the directors gym and had some interviews with various coaches such as Burgener and the coaches stories of how they got started out. It never highlights and modern lifters and shows them lifting or training, it was just old coaches talking about the old days. If i could i'd get my money back and i've told others not to waste their time it was like sitting at the bar of a VFW and listening to old guys tells the same stories over and over, only the money for the film didn't cover the drinks you need to enjoy the film.

6031738,5,B00FV6XK2I,"As we sat down to watch the movie and narrative starting coming in I immediately understood that this film was the first of its kind in this country. The film is interview based, interviewing on location some of the countrys most influential and accomplished coaches to coaches on a lower level that are making a key difference in the sport with youth today.
The film has a very unique point of view of Olympic Weightlifting that the majority of America did not know existed, the view of Olympic weightlifting as a professional sport as it is in many countries around the world not only used in some cases of strength and conditioning programs as it is here. Perfectly described in the film by Jim Schmitz In those countries, weightlifting is a meal ticket. We give up what they gain. In other words, we give up a good job, a good education to be a weightlifter, where they can get that by being a weightlifter.
Its the perspective nobody thinks about because its such a obscure sport in this country. Ask anyone on the street or in any gym about Olympic Weightlifting and they will have no idea. And that perspective is very interesting especially if you have found that strange love for lifting you never thought you would have.
The film will leave you with a great appreciation for the actual sacrifice a american athlete would have to make to compete on a national stage and a great understanding of why American Olympic gold medals in weightlifting are only a distant memory since Charles Vinci won the last gold in Rome in 1960.",1385251200,,1534,4.622710622710622

6031766,4,B00FV6XK2I,"After watching this, I spent a while trying to decide on a fair rating, because although I did appreciate the effort Greg put into this, it is seriously lacking as a documentary in my opinion.

First - I really liked seeing a lot of the athletes lifting. The filming was nothing original or unique, but it was some good film of people and athletes weightlifting and training.

Second - I enjoyed hearing from several of the coaches, their history in weightlifting, and what they're doing now.

Third - I appreciate the hard work Greg put into making this happen; this is the first American weightlifting documentary to my knowledge. The entire reason I bought this wasn't to be wowed, or even because I expected it would be a great documentary, but because I wanted to support Greg and weightlifting through him.

With that said, here are my critiques:
1. It felt like the first hour of the movie was ""why the US sucks at weightlifting."" Nothing original here, nothing I had not already read or seen a hundred times before. I felt like this was, in my opinion, a great waste of time. Does weightlifting struggle in the US? Yes. Do we need to spend the majority of a documentary about weightlifting on it? No. 15 minutes, sure; 30 minutes, ok. It is necessary to set up the last half of the film. But I think people just kept repeating themselves over and over about why weightlifting isn't popular in the USA. Perhaps if more of the first hour had been spent on more history of weightlifting in America, leading up to why its a struggling sport today, I would have enjoyed it more.

2. Limited selection of coaches/athletes interviewed. Where was Donny Shankle? Pendlay? Kyle Pierce (from LSUS)? Kendrick Farris? Holley Mangold? Omar Cummings? Or virtually any of the athletes what competed in the 2012 Olympics or the 2013 Pan Ams. (They did have Osario on their briefly; wish we could have heard more from him.) I feel like the selection of athletes and coaches interviewed was very narrow. I realize budget constraints are a big issue in some of this, but I still think a documentary on American weightlifting should have more of the ""stars"" of weightlifting currently.

Anyways. I'm glad I bought it because it supports a great coach in a great sport. I really hope that this starts to awaken weightlifting in America and raises awareness. Best wishes Greg.

EDIT (4/24/14): Greg just posted a great write-up answering many questions and complaints regarding his movie. Check it out on his site here: [...]",1384732800,3,2510,4.729977116704806
6031767,5,B00FV6XK2I,"I thought this documentary was executed really well.  As a relatively new Olympic Weightlifter (about a year of legitimate training), it was really neat to see some of the lineage behind the sport in the US.  The fact that it has never really taken off in the US is puzzling to me, though, there might just be too many mainstream sports here to have room for it.

I'm glad that the rise of CrossFit was mentioned and was attributed to a mini-surge in weightlifting over the last few years.  With no television coverage of weightlifting specifically it would seem that the most effective method would be through CrossFitters are which path they want to pursue heaviest (Oly vs. Gymnastics vs. GPP).

My favorite parts came in talking about high schools and youth programs that are taking on olympic lifting as a point of emphasis.  The discipline and focus on detail has a great crossover to kids and how they can benefit most in life as well as athletics.",1384732800,,955,4.654761904761905
6031768,5,B00FV6XK2I,Great documentary on the sport of Olympic weightlifting.  What I enjoyed most about the film is the exposure to the sport.  It is great that these programs exist is schools and that the focus is the get more kids involved.  They are the ones that are the future for not only Olympic weightlifting but for society in general.  I hope with this type of film it will bring out more coaches and will encourage more facilities to open and to teach this sport. I do give a lot of credit to CrossFit because in my own experience it is what introduced me to these specific lifts.,1384732800,,571,4.3584905660377355
6031769,5,B00FV6XK2I,"I really loved American Weightlifting, especially as a verbal record - and a visual snapshot - of where the sport stands in America right now. It is definitely a film most appealing to current lifters and coaches, as that group can commiserate. It is also a powerful film for people who love story-driven documentaries. I don't know if non-lifters could view it and remain attentive enough to take inspiration from it, or if they could really appreciate weightlifting as a result of these interviews, but a small few will realize that people love this sport against all odds and all reason.

The overall landscape is bleak. Coaches interviewed are plainly aware of the lack of resources, lack of cultural interest, lack of support their sport suffers. They are frank about why weightlifting flounders in the shadow of larger, more profitable sports, like football, baseball, basketball. They are clear on the obstacles restricting the sport from exploding into growth, like limited exposure, insufficient qualified coaches, and negligible potential prestige for success.

And, at times, that makes the film come across as depressing, as hopeless, and as ""preaching to the choir"" in one of our most neglected sports. But at the same time, the coaches have absolute passion for the sport, and it is plainly evident. They love it despite the suffering and struggle. They talk at length about their athletes who found success in the sport. They openly celebrate their coaching lineage. They readily admit that they hustle and work other jobs in order to continue coaching.

Some of them even share major innovations to spreading the sport - implementing it in high school sports programs, giving away coaching in city programs, acknowledging the critical role CrossFit and its derivatives will play in weightlifting's future.

I would have liked if they discussed more how they are working to grow the sport, how the non-lifter can be involved, why the non-lifter should care at all. There was certainly an opportunity to talk about how weightlifting once rallied American sports fans and how it could prove significant still. There would have been immense response if they had discussed in any detail how weightlifting can improve performance for those athletes in the big sports.

But, ultimately, American Weightlifting is just a framed photo on the wall, like a barbell racked across the shoulders of a lifter before the jerk. It can't tell you everything - whether the lift was made or missed - but it can tell you that not all is lost, because someone is still struggling to improve.",1384646400,,2585,5.05868544600939
6031770,4,B00FV6XK2I,"As this is the only documentary on the sport in the US there's really nothing to compare it too.

However, for the budget it was still a good product. It chronicled the current state of the sport.

However I would have liked it to go more into the sports history, the impression and interviews from the general public, and more gyms (only about 4 gyms were really shown).

Also, although I knew they would plug CrossFit they should have maybe gone in a bit deeper on the relationship.

Good product overall and there were enough clips of the lifts I feel better at them just by watching!",1384646400,,587,4.457943925233645

6031773,5,B00FV6XK2I,"American Weightlifting is a down to earth, low budget, no frills or special effects look into the beautiful sport of Olympic Weightlifting.  Like many people these days I am a newcomer to weightlifting because of CrossFit.  Despite my growing love for weightlifting I still have a limited knowledge of the history of Weightlifting in America.  Greg Everett's documentary is wonderful in the way he weaves the nostalgic stories of the past with the hopes and dreams of the future for this sport in America.  Throughout the film you hear the heartfelt stories from athletes and coaches alike.  They talk about how they got into weightlifting, who mentored and inspired them, why they do what they do, and what they hope the future will be like for the next generations.  The people interviewed range from weightlifting legends like Mike Burgener, John Thrush and Danny Camargo (to name a few).  But there are also some unknown athletes.  I loved hearing these athletes as they expressed their love affair with the barbell.  How they struggle through literal blood, sweat and tears every day for those few seconds on the platform.  But it's not one of those documentaries where you watch people sit in front of a camera.  Only a few moments out of each person's interview do you really see them talking.  Most of the time, as they are talking you are watching athletes train.  There were times when I found myself calling out at the athlete on the screen...""Come on...up, Up, UUUPP!!""  If you have ever worked on any of the Oly Lifts you probably would be too.

American Weightlifting was a four year project fully completed by Greg Everett of Catalyst Athletics.  He wrote, directed, produced, filmed and edited the documentary himself.  That in itself is not only praiseworthy but is a symbol of what Weightlifting in America is; a beautiful sport that unlike the more lucrative team sports of this country, is still unknown and under appreciated.  And this film does a wonderful job of pointing that out because instead of having a ""woa is me"" attitude leak through there is instead a hope that drives a passion to change the future of weightlifting in America.

I could go on and on and on about every little detail of this film, but then you wouldn't have a reason to watch it.  So, do yourself a favor...buy this film!  Learn about Weightlifting in America, support your local weightlifter and while you're at it, find a good gym and try it for yourself!",1384646400,,2457,4.788598574821853
6031774,5,B00FV6XK2I,"This movie is for the weightlifter and the lay person, and accurately portrays the efforts of US weightlifting. To assume a 2 hr documentary would include every caveat of the sport is asinine and childish. What this movie does great is set the benchmark for future documentaries and also gives the audience a true measure of the disparity in the sport. The footage is anything but weak, the filming was done brilliantly. If you watch closely, you will see when the tone of the movie goes dark and depressive the lifts being shown are predominately misses (smart filming!).

There will always be harsh critics that claim this work of art should of included every gym involved in the sport or should mention every American lifter of the past 50 years. But those critics would be miserable even if the director did such feats.",1384646400,,823,4.755244755244755

6031796,5,B00FV6XK2I,Great documentary. Slow at the beginning but DO NOT STOP WATCHING! Love that I can relate to almost every point in the movie. Hopefully this will shed some more light onto the sport and attract a more people. It's great because anyone that olympic lifts can relate to the physical & mental aspect that they're talking about. All in all.. great documentary. Olympic lifting is a GREAT SPORT & will always help mold you into a BETTER PERSON.,1384646400,,439,4.641025641025641
6031797,1,B00FV6XK2I,"This movie was depressing, not inspiring.  Most fans of weightlifting will like this simply because there are no other titles to compare it to.  The footage was weak, the dialogue narrow in scope.  I understand the limitations of budget, but this is not a well done documentary.  Nice try, but no cigar.",1384646400,4,303,4.769230769230769
6031798,5,B00FV6XK2I,"Greg Everett's ""American Weightlifting"" is an inspired and thoughtful look into the past, present and future of this sport. Told from the perspective of athletes and coaches within the sport, the film confronts the challenges that face weightlifters, coaches, and the existence of the sport in the United States. Deeply candid interviews frame the passion that so many have for what is an obscure and struggling sport. The fact that the entire film was essentially a 1-man operation, from concept to execution is a testament to Greg's passion and work ethic.",1384646400,,558,5.142857142857143

Overall, it beautifully describes the heart of this sport...the contrast between the continuous personal struggles and a zen-like relationship created between the lifter and the bar.  I hope everyone--lifters and non-lifters-- watch this movie and the sport of weightlifting finally begins to gain the recognition that it deserves!",1384646400,,488,5.957142857142857
6031801,5,B00FV6XK2I,"This IS American weightlifting. The opening prologue by Greg says it all. Brutal, exhausting, no money, no recognition. You just have to love it, even when it doesn't love you back.

As a weightlifter and a weightlifting coach, this documentary spoke to me from intro to conclusion. Where I coach, no one knows what weightlifting is. From my clubs in Wichita and Burden, Kansas, you would have to travel 160 miles to the north or 150 miles to the south to run into the next club. When I wear my weightlifting club or event t-shirts, I get asked all the time if I'm a powerlifter or how much I bench. America needs to know what weightlifting is. It is a beautiful sport that no one knows about. I do everything I can to advance the sport in my small corner of the country and it's so great to see such a high quality documentary come out about our sport that can be used to reach a multitude of, hopefully, future weightlifters. I am a high school strength and conditioning teacher and plan to show this video to all of my classes.

Thank you to Greg Everett and everyone else that works tirelessly to advance the sport of weightlifting in the USA.

6031834,5,B00FV6XK2I,"American Weightlifting: The Documentary is the two-hour story of a wild love affair shared by a select group of insanely dedicated athletes.

The first hour chronicles the domestic history of the sport, bringing us forward in time and revealing the current state of affairs in the sport. Interviews with veteran coaches are back dropped by a montage of athletes rituals, and an intriguing piano score, impressively composed by Mr. Everett.

If you were not previously enamored with Olympic Weightlifting, the first hour of American Weightlifting might feel like a slow-moving Kickstarter campaign. I sincerely hope you do not quit watching early.

Suddenly, as if the film were given a rousing halftime speech from Coach Carter (Gene Hackman in Hoosiers), rock & roll music kicks in, and your blood starts pumping.

The second hour answers all of your questions. Why am I watching this? What does it take be a weightlifter? Why should I love this? What is the purpose of this film?

These answers are illustrated in the fears, pressures, hardships, successes, and failures that athletes and coaches alike must endure. The strategies and nuances of competition are brought forth.  You learn about what its like to train for years, only to be judged in twenty seconds for all of your hard work. You feel the sheer joy of what its like to succeed in that moment, watching athlete and coach unable to contain themselves in celebration.

Emotions run high and deep. Coaches describe how they refuse to die before they accomplish the elusive goal of sending an American athlete to the Olympics. In the most poignant moment of the film, Aimee Everett gives us raw honesty that inspires.

Perhaps most importantly, you see that young high school kids will form waiting lists to participate in these programs, and why not? The Presidential fitness test of a mile run, sit-ups, and pull-ups in most PE classes is as popular as VHS tapes. There is a place for this sport among our youth, if we make it for them.

The film finishes strong and ties together the history from the first hour seamlessly in the second. Youll think to yourself, Ah, now I know why all those stories are meaningful.

American Weightlifting is not about raising money for the sport, even though the need for money is mentioned throughout. Greg explicitly tells you why weightlifters don't need benefactors. He just wants you to watch the film, and decide if you are in, or if you are out.

So do I. In his first film, Greg Everett has done a masterful job. The film is powerful and moving. The images and stories connect. Every athlete, parent, and coach needs to watch it.

Greg Everett and I are not friends. We have never met. I do buy all of his books, and follow his weightlifting programs. I am a fan, but I am also an objective writer. I was not paid for this review. I do not do curls.",1384387200,10,2857,4.737903225806452

In one sentence they are saying, ""we need more athletes to come in the door to grow our pool of talent to pick from to go to the olympics."" but later in the movie the same coaches are saying, ""if you aren't going to put everything you have in it, sacrifice some of your life, and try to win, you might as well get out of weightlifting and do arm curls.""
