They just don't make 'em like this anymore!  Jewel Riders is a colorful world of friendship, love, and adventure, with very little violence and ""suggestive"" themes like most of today's cartoons have.  The main characters are wonderful role models, and the show promotes love and friendship and believe in magic despite all odds.
