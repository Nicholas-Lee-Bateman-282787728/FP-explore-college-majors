2158818,5,B00062DKO0,"Not being familiar with yoga, I chose this DVD because of Rodney Yee's reputation and the low cost.  What I found was an easy to follow workout that makes you feel relaxed, and yet energized, after the first session.  There are no bells or whistles, just a great workout.  I've purchases two other titles in the series, Power Yoga - Strength and Power Yoga - Stamina, and I switch off each workout.  Some of the moves are more difficult than others, but it gives you something to work up to.  If I couldn't do a stretch, I would go as far as I could and hold it. It was a great feeling when I was finally able to stand in a pose or do a stretch that initailly I was unable to do.  Aside from these video's, the only equipment that you need is a mat which is extremely important to prevent slipping and back pain...  I DO know this for a fact.",1142812800,10,842,4.128834355828221
2158819,4,B00062DKO0,"I got this one based on others recommendations.  I did not like it at the beginning because I am beginner and I am not familiar with the yoga jargons.  This workout is very fast pace.  If I looked at the TV, I did not have enough time to follow him.  I got frustrated and only did a couple poses then gave it up.  I picked it up after a few month I read a post saying I had to preview this dvd and get familiar with the flows then do it.  This time I really enjoy it.  After I finished all the routine first time, I felt really nice stretch and relax in my body.  I felt sore in the next few days.  Now I try to do it every day.  I can see my flexibility increase.

The title for Beginner might sound misleading.  But even you are a beginner, if you preview it you will be able to follow it and get a very nice workout from it.

I would give this dvd a A",1137974400,,854,3.784090909090909
2158820,1,B00062DKO0,"I bought this dvd because Rodney Yee is so highly recommended by others...even this dvd comes with praise by most viewers. However, this dvd is for ""beginners"" and doesn't come with any instruction about the poses or any ""teaching"" section. Rodney begins quickly and the dvd is very fast-paced---as if the viewer is a yoga expert and the routine a basic one. I would appreciate the workout if there was a preview section of the poses...or if Rodney would simply tell us what is coming up next. Not good for beginners.",1133049600,23,517,4.6923076923076925
2158821,5,B00062DKO0,"I have several Rodney Yee DVDs and this is one of my favorites. I am 52 years old and, although I have always exercised and been active, I have never been very flexible. This one is perfect for warming up your body and challenging it just enough so that you safely increase your flexiblility.  I have been doing yoga videos for over 4 years starting with Rodney's AM/PM. I have recommended Rodney's "" Back Care Yoga"" to my contemporaries as a good starting video and am now recommending this one as the next step.  I love his calm voice, the serene locations and (with this one expecially) the relaxing meditative endings.",1128902400,92,622,4.594594594594595
2158822,5,B00062DKO0,"This has been my favorite yoga video for at least the past decade.  When I wore out my VHS tape, I bought the DVD; when I ditched my DVD player for streaming video, Power Yoga for Flexibility was the first video I streamed.  Set in the timeless Joshua Tree national park, Rodney Yee produced a compact power yoga routine with some of my favorite poses: exalted warrior, backbend lunge and pigeon lunge (shown on cover).  Throughout the routine Rodney Yee inspires mindfulness by saying things like, ""feel like the toes are buds ready to blossom in spring,"" and ""the skin on the face is supple.""  Great vid.",1481846400,3,606,4.635514018691588
2158823,4,B00062DKO0,"Oops.  I got this thinking I'd progressed some in my yoga practice and based on reviews it seemed like a good next step, but I'm not ready yet.  I'll still give it 4 stars though because I think it's a good video, I just need to save it for when I'm ready.  I feel he goes super fast. I have to pause the video and catch up sometimes.",1475712000,,334,3.8823529411764706
2158824,3,B00062DKO0,"Good if you like sun salutations. The first half of the video is the same repetitive sun salutation. Very good with narrations. Beautiful scenery, but i was expecting more of a variety if poses.",1474934400,,194,4.735294117647059
2158825,5,B00062DKO0,"Rodney Yee, has the most soothing delivery of the poses, they are very doable for the beginner, and he makes you focus on your breathing.",1473292800,,137,4.52
2158826,5,B00062DKO0,"I bought this as I've started jogging and wanted a yoga routine to help stretch and it is working really well.  The routine is fast enough to feel like I'm getting exercise but afterwards I feel great, calm and with well stretched muscles.  Some people said that it's not ideal for beginners but I disagree. The poses aren't very complicated and most are repeated very often, making it easy enough to learn quickly.  One comment is that it's about 26 minutes when you subtract the intro and credits, I wanted a 30 minute workout, not a 30 minute DVD.  But it's a small quibble.",1473206400,4,577,4.519230769230769
2158827,3,B00062DKO0,"This says it's for beginners, and I can tell from the poses, etc. that it probably is, but it moves very quickly from one pose to the next with little explanation on what you are doing. If you don't already know what some of the poses are called, you can get lost quickly. Other than that, it's a nice, short program.",1471046400,,317,4.213114754098361

2158830,1,B00062DKO0,"I finally got around to opening the DVD to do the workout only to find the disc doesn't work. I received two different messages. 1. CD/DVD is blank and 2. CD/DVD cannot be played in my region. I'm sure I would love the workout if only I could view it. Unfortunately, the return period has passed.  Fortunately, I didn't pull the trigger on the other items on my wishlist. What a waste of money. Why sell customers CD/DVD's that can't be played back in their area when shipping addresses are readily available to cross reference? If you purchase a CD/DVD test it right away. Don't sit on it as I did (planning graduation festivities) and end up a*s out of money and product.",1462492800,,673,4.471544715447155

2158837,3,B00062DKO0,For someone painfully unflexible as me he goes way to fast to get any of the motions down. I was pausing constantly to see if my form was proper. Finally googled videos that were better.,1448668800,,186,4.3428571428571425

2158842,5,B00062DKO0,"Believe me Yoga is the best and this Yee guy knows his stuff.  I am a beginner at Yoga.  My doctor told me to get Rodney Yee's workouts because  I have arthritis in my knees.  The scenery around him is beautiful and inspires you to do the workout.

2158847,1,B00062DKO0,Very repetitious. For beginners instruction limited. Go into this pose. Go into that pose. I have some yoga background and couldn't keep up. No modifications. He's doing advanced transition that should not be in a beginners dvd. Feel like you would have to watch and do this dad many times before being able to do it with a little flow and not staring at screen. Very disappointed. Will not purchase any more with Rodney as instructor.,1430092800,,435,4.7368421052631575

I'm an older person with a new hip.  This Power Yoga - Flexibility video is exactly what I wanted.  It's running time is a little over 28 minutes and it's perfect for me, a permanent beginner. The moves are a little more challenging while at the same time being beginner friendly.

There are lots of forward bends, planks, stretches and finally the relaxation pose.  I would recommend this video.",1404518400,,584,4.742574257425742
2158872,3,B00062DKO0,"Overall, this is a nice 30-min yoga practice that anyone at any level can enjoy.  I like the length of the workout, but the pace is a little fast.  This made for a good workout, but I felt a little rushed and had a hard time loosening up in the beginning.  Still, it's a great one to have in your repertoire.",1403913600,,308,4.016393442622951
2158873,4,B00062DKO0,"I am somewhat new to yoga, but not new to exercise. I thought this was great, not as great as Power Yoga: Strength though. I like Rodney Yee because he is calm and easy to follow if you know the basic poses. I like the quick speed because I don't have time to do a full hour of yoga, but for flexibility I wanted to stretch a little bit more in each pose. My back ends up hurting by the end, but I think that is just because I haven't done it enough to get used to and do it right. All in all, good Dvd, not quite as good as the strength one.",1402617600,,542,3.763157894736842

2158878,2,B00062DKO0,"After finally taking a couple of instructor-led yoga classes I realized why this DVD was so frustrating to me.  It was way too fast for a novice.  My instructors emphasized deep breathing (Ujjayi breath) and holding the poses for enough time to ""feel it"".  Rodney is obviously in perfect condition and can do all of the poses in quick sequence.  If there was a way to watch this DVD in slow motion I would get more out of it.  My other pet peeve is that there is too much intro on the DVD which cannot be skipped.",1397260800,2,513,4.247422680412371

In the past, I've alternated between his Power Yoga and Daily DVDs, but I think I will doing far less alternating in the future. I LOVE THIS ROUTINE! It's perfect for what I need; movement, all-over stretching, repetition (but not to a boring extent), and not too long or too short. The moves he uses are all beginner moves, but the way he puts them together still makes me break a slight sweat. The next day, I feel amazing.

2158896,5,B00062DKO0,"Rodney Yee's style of yoga instruction is great for a beginner like myself - the pace allows me to actually figure out what he's doing AND manage to do it before he's moved on to the next pose unlike so many yoga videos that seem only geared towards advanced users who already know what they're doing. That being said, my wife (who is much more advanced than I) seems to enjoy the video too (though that may be attributed to Yee's seeming inability to ever wear clothes).",1393459200,,471,4.425287356321839

I crossfit 5 days a week and yoga the other two to help rejuvenate my muscles after a long week of working out.

When I first popped in the dvd, I was concerned because the title said ""Power Yoga Flexibility: For Beginners"". I wasn't aware of the ""for beginners"" caveat when I purchased this - I have been practicing yoga for 6+ years and do not consider myself a beginner. I am so glad that this title was wrong.

This is a great vinyasa flow practice and much different than Yee's Total Body dvd. This video is much more fast paced and definitely not for beginners due to his quick instruction with pose names (ie. pigeon lunge) without any explanation. I love this practice - it will definitely limber you up for your day! I was also appreciative that Yee remained committed to the mind-body aspect of yoga - by the end of the practice I also felt enlivened mentally, as well as physically.",1286150400,5,982,4.419889502762431

Sounds cheesy, I know, but I really refer back to this workout as a basis for all my stretching and flexibility workouts - - whether I am following this one exactly, stretching or doing yoga on my own, or following some other workout. Even after having a baby this April and being terribly out of shape and inflexible toward the end of the pregnancy, I am still more limber than I ever was before I bought this. And to top off the cake, this workout is a great natural high with all the forward stretches. By the end of the seated poses I'm typically feeling a wash of relaxation and calm. It's gentle and well-explained and goes at a calm pace. When I first got it I had to modify most of the poses quite a lot but I was amazed at how quickly my flexibility increased (though never on par with Rodney Yee) and it has continued to be a challenging and beneficial workout all these years.

I finally just wanted to do something regularly and I needed it to be economical and this fit the ticket.  Having Yoga at home is great and so convenient.

Every time I use this DVD I enjoy it a great deal and I come away with just what I needed...whether to relax or destress, lengthen a tight and tense body or get some form of stregthening and stretching in...it works fabulously!  I come away centered, relaxed, limber and so, so euphoric!!!!

I have increased my flexibility so much in just 4 months and I typically only use it once or twice a week on average (but that is the magic of this special routine targetting and hitting all over your body in just 25 minutes all together!).  I am also doing cardio and weights here and there and so I really need to have something which is all about lengthening, stretching and relaxing and this fits the ticket all the way!!!!

I notice a few people expressing reluctance if you are a beginner and I have to say that I think it is good for newbies too; but only if you watch the dvd a few times prior to actually following along with Rodney.  I would also say that it with it being called Power Yoga; you should be prepared for a slight bit of intensity which will require moving quickly and a bit of upper body strength from time to time.  However it is not overwhelmingly intense or challenging as the goal is not to break a serious sweat.  What you will get is just enough movement with stretching and Yoga poses to restore bodily flexibility, along with appropriate mental and emotional balance.  You honestly get so much out of so little truly!!!!

2159049,4,B00062DKO0,"I am still new to the world of yoga, but I have already developed an appreciation for Rodney Yee's exercise DVDs.  Simple in production, long on substance, short on both instruction and new-agey faux-wisdom, these DVDs provide excellent replay value.

""Power Yoga: Flexibility"" is a surprisingly short (25-minute) workout.  Set in the desert, the DVD features, as usual, Yee flying solo on his yoga mat with some telegenic scenery nearby.  Yee opens with several quick transitions through sun salutations before moving into some downward-dog poses and finishing with some sitting stretches (forward bends, pigeon, etc.).

I had expected a ""flexibility"" workout to be both longer and slower - something more akin to Yee's hour-long ""Yoga Burn"" DVD (my current favorite).  But I have to admit, when you're finished with this workout, you will feel more limber than before.  Perhaps after a month or two of working this routine into the regular workout series you will really see the difference.

I have only two quibbles with this DVD.  First, why is there no option for a longer workout?  It's not as if the DVD lacks the storage space.  Second, many of these poses are found in other Yee DVDs - indeed, there is very little here that is all that different from Yee's ""Power Yoga:  Strength"" workout.  Both involve sun salutations and down-dog poses - the differences are at the margins.  I suppose all yoga workouts improve your flexilibility, but I had expected a more unique workout.

That being said, I still recommend this DVD given the main limitation - it's a 25-minute workout.  It succeeds in the two primary areas - it provides a good workout and you'll have no problem watching it repeatedly - Yee studiously avoids the spiritual histrionics that plague so many other yoga DVDs.",1259712000,2,1788,4.949664429530201

And there is a lot of sun salutations but barely any poses.  I know it's only 30 minutes long but if it is to make you flexible they should have skippped the many MANY sun salutations and held postures for at least 5 BREATHS.  And speaking of breaths he barely prompts you to ""inhale/exhale"" but no emphasis on deep breathing or deep stretching.  I am very disappointed in this DVD.",1250640000,14,530,4.357142857142857

2159055,4,B00062DKO0,"You really can't go wrong with Rodney Yee. But he does lack the attention to the viewer and practitioner you'll get from Bryan Kest, for example. He doesn't talk to you or about your feelings and the poses are too quick in some places to do much good. A pose should be held about 12 seconds at least. You're in up dog about one to two seconds and must revert to down dog.

Nonetheless, you get a good general physical workout and feel tenseness fade. So this short yoga session serves it's purpose.

Recommended.

2159056,4,B00062DKO0,"good intro flexibility poses, now I'd like to find something a little more advanced to fit the 30-minute dvd niche-- maybe another one of his DVDs. At first it feels like he's moving through the poses too quickly, but I've gotten used to that, or maybe just learned to be more in synch with the DVD",1244764800,,298,4.339285714285714
2159057,4,B00062DKO0,"I would disagree with the other reviews that say that this is not for beginners.  I use this DVD 3x a week in the mornings and I have never been to a yoga class in my life.  I decided to get this DVD because I lift weights and play ultimate frisbee (lots of hard running and change of direction) frequently.  I've noticed that as I get older (mid-30s) my body is starting to become very unflexible, and this is leading to more and more injuries.

Here are some tips that I think would make this DVD easier for beginners:
- Watch the whole thing before you try it.  Rodney does move through each pose fairly quickly so it's helpful to have an image of what he's doing in your head.  After a few times you won't need to look at the screen anymore.
- Feel free to improvise slightly.  I don't worry about doing everything right as Rodney says I should.  If there is a stretch that I feel I need to spend longer on, I do, even if it means skipping the next pose.
- Don't worry if you feel awkward and can't move through the poses as gracefully as Rodney does.
- Don't feel the need to interpret Rodney literally.  When he says to ""jump forward"" don't do it unless it's comfortable.  I personally just walk forward because I lack the back flexibility to jump w/o hurting myself.

Overall I think this is a good DVD.  It's only 30 min in length so that makes it easy to work into a morning routine.  I find the stretches are mostly for the hamstrings and back.  The hips and calves are stretched a little and the quadriceps not at all.  Therefore, I still spend some time doing other stretching.  I know that I could just stretch on my own but let's face it, if I was motivated enough to do that I wouldn't have ever bothered with this DVD.",1244073600,,1734,4.224924012158055

I am still in the process of learning to breath along with the poses as is emphasised in any Yoga practice. Apparently not in his Power Yoga series. It felt as if I was doing an aerobics workout.

As Stated in the title this is a `power' practice so there is a flowing sequence to the poses which includes some jumping. I wouldn't recommend this if you're a beginner. It is better suited to those who have some knowledge of the basic poses as it moves quite quickly from one pose to the next. As usual Rodney Yee has impeccable voice instruction. The music is great and it has been filmed in Joshua Tree National Park so the scenery is beautiful.

The practice includes; Sun salutations, Triangle pose, Pigeon and Backbend lunges, Seated, Wide angle and Foreword bends, Cobblers pose, Reclined twist and finally a great relaxation/meditation segment at the end. No props are needed, except your yoga mat.

Rodney does alot of upward dog and downward dog poses in between wich i liked because it helped with warming up and developing upper body strengh.. so its a constant flow of moves. The only setback i have with this is he doesnt teach much breathing techniques, wich is vital to yoga. As a general rule, folding down you exhale, and coming back up you inhale. You will get very good stretching with his program. Also the setting and music are not distracting at all.

2159087,4,B00062DKO0,"Maybe the ""beginner"" refers to people who are just getting into POWER yoga. I've been doing yoga for a while, but I'm not super-fit. I was a bit intimidated by the title, but it's not significantly more strenuous than some of the non-power yoga DVDs I have. By the last couple of times I'm jumping to push-up pose or forward bend, my arms are starting to feel it, but otherwise I didn't feel like I was over my ability level.

If you've never done any yoga before, you'll probably want to watch this a couple times before trying to follow along. The first part, the Sun Salutation variations, is fast-paced, and Rodney's calling out the poses without really explaining what you're supposed to do. You'll figure out downward dog soon enough - I swear it's about every third pose. Unfortunately for me, it is NOT one of my favorites.

I wish the DVD had chapters, so that it was easier to skip over the introduction by the third or fourth time. Although if it did, I'd probably be tempted to skip the Sun Salutations and just do the seated/reclining second part. I really liked that section, but I suppose it works because of the warm-up in the first half.

I'll give it four stars, because I feel like I had a good workout, I generally like Rodney's style, and it has Yoga Journal's beautiful cinematography (this one is filmed in Joshua Tree National Park), but I won't be doing it as often as some of my other DVDs with less downward dog.",1180828800,5,1439,4.484732824427481

I loved the flow of this practice. Yes, the sun salutations are a bit fast, but is okay since this warms you up for the floor stretches to follow. He holds you in downward facing dog to rest, but I think the pace is perfect to warm you up quickly. It is a short workout of only 30 min., but perfect for those days when I don't have a lot of time. You will definitely get the flexibility on the floor postures after the warm up.

I use Rodney's ""Power Yoga Total Body"" which I love too, but it is 1 hour. This practice is very similar, but 1/2 the time. You really can't go wrong on this one for $7 on Amazon.

It is beautifully filmed in Joshua Tree which brings back memories for me of rock climbing in the 70's...

8036896,3,B00062DKO0,This video was referred to me by a colleague I am a beginner and I personally thought this video was way too fast for a beginner. By the time I got into my post he was switching into the next pose Hard to get to the next level when you can't hold your pose. I will not buy another one of his tapes,1493078400,,297,3.7301587301587302
