8736133,3,B016APTT3C,"Ok, I really liked this DVD. The massage she shows using the stick are amazing! I took 2 stars off because she only shows the massage once and it's only for a couple minutes. She only does one side of the body. Some people might be ok with starting the DVD over to do the other side. Other than that the massages are wonderful.",1479168000,,327,4.125
8736134,4,B016APTT3C,"I purchased the Dance Crazy Muscle Madness Stick DVD to give me some direction on how best to use my medium massage stick. I really like how you can choose the chapters that you want to watch instead of having to watch it all or trying to find which one you want to watch. I like how it starts with a warm up, which is always good to warm up before any exercise. They also take you step by step through each exercise and give you some time in between to do the other side as well.

Overall, this is a pretty good instructional video to help massage those troubled areas or to warm up your muscles before exercise. it's also good to learn the muscle groups associated with those being worked out and how to get the most out of your massage stick. Although once you get the exercises down, you will no longer need the video and that is why I gave it one less star.",1478044800,,862,4.130952380952381
8736135,4,B016APTT3C,I was watching the olympic trials and saw the athletes using their massage roller so I was interested in what it does.  I got dvd at a discount price.  It was very good on explaining the advantages of pressure points of your muscles after a workout.  It is very beneficial on how the massage roller should be used.  I gave it four stars because I am a beginner with massage stick.,1468454400,,380,4.309859154929577
8736136,4,B016APTT3C,"Like their other instructional videos this one is very step by step starting with stretching the entire body. I admit I didn't realize there were so many different massage sticks until I watched this. The DVD is simple to follow and easy to understand. There is time given between each move for you to do that same on the other side. I like that it extensively covers the lower half of the body, but I wish it showed more for the upper half as this is where I carry my stress and muscle tightness...this is the reason I only gave it 4 stars. The video is great at teaching you how to loosen and work through muscle tightness and aches and for me was helpful in learning how to use my large massage stick (learned that from this video) the best for what tightness or aches are going on.

I received this video at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.",1467244800,,864,4.300613496932515

8736138,4,B016APTT3C,"I have really enjoyed DanceCrazy's fitness videos.  I purchased a massage roller and haven't been really sure about how to use it.  This video does a great job of giving instructions and providing you with an idea of how to use the roller but also the muscle groups.  The first part of the video is an introduction to the massage roller, Then the instructor has you warm up with easy stretches.  These stretches warm you up so that the muscles you will work with the roller are warmed up and the joints are lubricated more.  The instructor stays calm during the workout and walks you through the proper use of the equipment.  She gives you time to use the roller during the video and explains what muscle groups you are working.  I feel like I have a much better understanding of the stick and how to work it properly along my muscles.

I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.  All opinions and impressions are my own.",1461456000,2,953,4.46242774566474
8736139,4,B016APTT3C,"The price is for the DVD by itself. You will also need a massage stick and chair to complete the exercises on this dvd.

The chapter selection/dvd menu gives you 2 options. You can play all or click on individual chapter selections.

There are 12 chapter selections to choose from.

1. Introduction: 0:00-1:04 mins
The intro shows the 3 different rollers that the lady is using for this dvd. Light, medium and heavy. She mostly uses the medium.

2. Dynamic warm up: 1:04-6:00 mins
**The warm up is demonstrating exercises like neck rolls, shoulder shrugs, arm circles to warm the body up before using the massage roller stick. You do not need a chair or stick for the warm up.

3. Feet: 6:00-7:56
**For chapter selections 3-10, you will be barefoot and need a chair.

4. Lower leg: 7:56-10:15

5. Calves and Soleus: 10:15-12:55

6. IT band: 12:55-14:47

7. Inner thigh: 14:47-16:28

8. Quadriceps: 16:28-18:48

9. Hamstrings: 18:48-21:32
**Can be done standing or using the chair

10. Triceps: 21:32-23:06
**Demonstrated kneeling and using the chair to support the roller stick

11. Partner exercises: 23:06-25:04
**Only shows 2 partner exercises and is not even demonstrated with 2 people.

12. Outro/Ending: 25:04-25:24

Each selection focuses on the different muscles and body areas. She does a great job with the anatomy terms and going slowly step by step making it very easy to follow and understand.

I really enjoyed rolling my feet!

I enjoyed this dvd because it helped me learn the muscle names and different ways to use my roller stick.

However, I found several things that I feel need to be changed about this dvd.

First, the dvd Amazon description needs to be more descriptive to help potential buyers know what they are buying. There is no listing of times and equipment needed which is very important. Because this dvd is only 20 minutes of actual instruction and doesn't even come with the roller; I feel like the price is way too high. I would only pay $9.99 or less for this instructional dvd.

Second, on the dvd front cover it says ""warm/cooldown"". There is a 5 min warm up (selection 2) but no cool down on this dvd unless you are going to repeat selection 2 again as your cool down.

Third, the back of the dvd cover says the running time is 60 mins, which is definitely not true. At most, it is 25:24 mins which includes the intro, ending, and warm up which are not even part of the step by step instructions.

Fourth, I did not feel like the 2 exercises mentioned in selection 11-partner exercises-were even helpful. She did not have a partner to help demonstrate them, so I personally would have just eliminated that chapter selection or thought ahead and got a partner to demonstrate.

The marketing of this dvd definitely needs to be redone so the things mentioned above are accurate and not misleading. Regardless, I still feel like this dvd is a good step by step instructional dvd that I will be using in the future with my roller massage stick.

I received this item complimentary from the Tomoson Blogger program for blog and social media review. All opinions are my own.",1459209600,4,3106,4.719851576994434
