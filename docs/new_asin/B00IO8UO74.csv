Old fashioned melodies in the movie and extras provide insight into an era which may not have actually existed as portrayed but represents stable family life, morality, and decency. Gordon and Doris were excellent singers and provide an example of a young couple in love in a bygone era. Respect and dignity (mostly) are showcased. Rosemary and Leon have always been my favorites. Beautiful print and sound. Young Billy Gray just before Father Knows Best is a delight.",1515283200,2,493,5.098765432098766

In the movies there are lots of old fashioned family scenes from another era, which makes it enjoyable for the whole family.

6283802,5,B00IO8UO74,"These are fun, goofy, and silly, but well done in all those areas.  If you want something feel good, silly, and not at all worrisome, then grab these.  They are sequels.  I definitely like the second best, Silvery Moon.  Marjorie, (Doris Day) is a young women, who thinks she's a boy, till she moves to a new town and meets the boy next door who is just home visiting from college (Gordan Mcrae).  There are some mix ups and some nice songs.  My favorite in both movies is the little brother, he's a scream.  It has a delightfully cast family and household Maid.  In the second, Gordon Mcrae is just getting back from the war and isn't so sure he's as ready to marry as he'd planned when he left Marjorie, so the fun begins again, with other suitors, a mix up about her father and an actress, and a Thanksgiving Turkey you'll never forget.  So fun, I want to go watch it again just thinking of all the corny-delightful laughs.

6283816,5,B00IO8UO74,"This film duo is one that I go back to whenever I need some cheering up.
No one could play the girl next door like Doris Day and teamed up with Gordon McCrae made for a genuine on screen chemistry.
They are a boy and girl living in a small Indiana town at the start of World War 1 in On Moonlight Bay.
Their on again/off again romance is fueled by the antics of tomboy Doris Day's character's younger brother, Wesley (played by Billy Gray). He is always making up stories and adds quite a bit of the humor topped off with Leon Ames playing their banker father.
The story is interspersed with some nice musical numbers from Doris and several with Doris and Gordon McCrae.
Rosemary Decamp plays the dutiful mother and wife but she stands her ground and never fades into the furniture.
She was perfect here playing the mother and Mary Wickes is her old plucky self as their housekeeper.
And speaking of ""keepers"" this set is just that!",1420156800,13,932,4.424418604651163

6283821,5,B00IO8UO74,"I am a big fan of Doris Day, but I can't help but remember MGM's stellar classic ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" starring Judy Garland. Similarities are stunning; the parents of Marjorie Winfield (Doris Day) in this movie look and act similar to parents in ""Meet Me in St Louis."" The story is very similar and some critics suggested that this is Warner Brothers version of MGM's Christmas classic. But anyone who likes Doris Day and the musicals would love this movie. In fact this movie was such a hit that the studio filmed another direct sequel ""By the Light of the Silvery Moon (1953)"" with all the actors playing the same characters.

The story is about the Winfield family who move into a small town in Indiana. Marjorie Winfield, the daughter of the family begins to romance William Sherman (Gordon MacRae) who lives across the street. Tomboy Marjorie slowly transforms herself into a beautiful young lady. Although Doris Day and Gordon MacRae are little old for the roles they play but their romance picks up and both display their vocal abilities in a number of songs. Jack C. Smith plays the role of Doris' persistent suitor who won't take no for an answer. Ellen Corby is a wonderful schoolteacher who tries to straighten the misbehaving Billy Gray, the brother of Doris Day and Mary Wickes as a maid who is constantly dropping the silverware. This is an outstanding movie despite the fact it has strong resemblance to ""Meet Me in St. Louis."" I highly recommend this musical to all the fans of Doris Day.",1417564800,5,1506,4.683018867924528
