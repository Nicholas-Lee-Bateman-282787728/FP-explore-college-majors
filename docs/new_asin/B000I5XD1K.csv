8143981,5,B000I5XD1K,"I'm a longtime fan of Tony Robbins, even drove to Del Mar to the white castle he once owned only six months before he was flat broke living in a tiny apartment washing his dishes in the bathtub.

The Edge is packed full of fresher modern get-off-the-dime and do something motivations.  Loved this, later bought it again for son.

8143982,5,B000I5XD1K,"Anthony Robbins,can't say enough about what this man does, with his programs. I haven't found a program that isn't good to listen to.",1301356800,,133,4.826086956521739
8143983,1,B000I5XD1K,"If you're in the self-help section, and have already exhausted your traditional avenues of help (friends, family, social groups, church, etc.) do you really believe a puffed-up infomercial will have answers for you?",1194912000,3,215,5.545454545454546
8143984,3,B000I5XD1K,"If you're a Tony Robbins fan, please think twice before buying this 2-CD set.  Those two CDs are Days 1 and 2 of the complete 10-CD ""The Edge"" set.  On the other hand, if you're just curious to hear what Tony's talking about now, you'll get an idea from this package.

There's nothing new here, but that's not a bad thing.  Tony Robbins has always been careful to update his information, and it's always presented in an encouraging, chatty, upbeat manner (which many people find appealing).  Tony's enthusiasm is contageous.

One warning to those who haven't had good luck with seminars and motivational material:  As a forty-year self-improvement junkie (I bought my first self-help book when I was in college), I've learned that you can be incredibly motivated, but if you don't know what you really want and your goals and plans don't match what you really want, all the enthusiasm in the world isn't going to get you what you want.

If you'd like to quicky and painlessly learn what you really want, try the 2-CD program, ""Before You Hire A Life Coach . . . Heal Your Issues Through Pyramid Problem Solving.""  The process lets you get straight to what you really want (rather than what you think you want or should want or used to want).

After trying Pyramid Problem Solving, you'll be able to SUCCESSFULLY use motivational seminars and programs!",1189382400,6,1351,4.735042735042735
8143985,1,B000I5XD1K,"I've always enjoyed Tony Robbins and I believe he has a great message. I own 5 of his books, the ""Personal Power"" and ""Get The Edge"" programs and several of his Power Talk cd's. I bought this because it lead me to believe it was a visual of what I already have. What it really is, is a commercial for his products and seminar. This is a BIG disappointment and every misleading. Save your money and just watch one of his infomercials on TV, it's free!",1175731200,27,450,4.244186046511628
8143986,2,B000I5XD1K,I was looking for a Tony Robbins DVD for a more visual experience than the tapes alone. I love Tony's work however this DVD was extremely disappointing and was really nothing more than a sales pitch for his seminars.,1169078400,29,216,4.564102564102564
8143987,4,B000I5XD1K,"I have used Tony's material with great success, but please be advised that this is not a NEW program, it is merely an introductory program to his full ""Get the Edge"" program.  I didn't realize this when I bought it.",1168819200,26,215,4.375
8143988,1,B000I5XD1K,THIS SET CONSISTS OF 2 CD'S AND A BONUS DVD THAT IS 10 MINUTES LONG! AMAZON ADVERTISED IT AS A DVD SET. IT IS NOT A FULL DVD,1164067200,54,124,3.4642857142857144
