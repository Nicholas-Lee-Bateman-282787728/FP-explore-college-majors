3737122,4,B001P2VNWQ,"This is a good workout and I always love Amy Dixon. I do like her Women's Health workouts better but this is good to mix it up. I still generally grab the Perfect Body Workout or the Ultimate Body Workout and even the 10 Minute Workout before I pick this one. However, it is a good addition to my collection.",1265846400,,308,4.15
3737123,5,B001P2VNWQ,"I love it when I find a workout DVD that I REALLY love because sometimes I just don't feel like leaving my house to exercise!  I have quite a few, but Kickin' Strength is fast becoming one of my favorite workout DVDs.  Amy is great; she throws a lot of challenges your way - mixing both cardio and strength training in an intense, but fun, TOTAL BODY workout.  Would recommend to ANYONE looking to get/stay fit in the comforts of your own home!",1264204800,,444,4.325301204819277
3737124,5,B001P2VNWQ,This is the fourth video I bought of Amy's. I love her workouts. Her exercises are different and fun and she makes you sweat!,1256256000,,125,4.25
3737125,5,B001P2VNWQ,Amy Dixon is a great instructor. Love how she isn't repetitive and gets most of the muscle groups. Make sure to add the bonus section for core and stretch so you truly get the well rounded workout.,1255651200,,197,4.351351351351352
3737126,5,B001P2VNWQ,"This will keep you heart rate up throughout the entire workout.  Amy is informative and encouraging but not overly chatty.  All moves transition fluidly, covering a wide variety of muscles from different angles.  The bonus section alone makes it worth buying the DVD because they have the best abs and core workout ( Workout in Ten and Perfect Body are also excellent and different!)  The progressions can be a little challenging but keep you from getting bored after doing the workout ten or twenty times.",1238630400,10,506,4.91764705882353
3737127,5,B001P2VNWQ,"I never did any of amy's tapes but this one is excellent, i worked up a sweat and had a great time doing it, she has a kickboxing section and then weights, and her weight section is great A must buy",1235260800,5,198,3.8536585365853657
3737128,5,B001P2VNWQ,"I'll be honest, I was a little nervous when I saw that Amy Dixon's next DVD wasn't affiliated with Women's Health, like all of her previous stuff was, but when I did the workout, I realized it obviously wasn't Women's Health that created a great workout, it's Amy... whereever, or whoever, she works with.

I'm a huge fan of hers, and been doing her other workouts for a while now (the Workout in 10 is my personal favorite.)  This is a kickboxing workout that will totally bust your booty.  Like in her other workouts, the key to making these work is Amy herself.  She's got a really energetic personality that makes you WANT to work out with her.  And I'll tell you what, by the end, I was spent.  This workout is tough.  So if you're a complete novice, be forewarned.  It's not really for the faint of heart.  But if you want a good kickboxing workout that will make you feel like you actually worked out, you won't do better than this.

Point blank, it's just a good, fun workout.  And for me, I need it to be fun.  This definitely was.",1233705600,22,1040,4.331606217616581
3737129,3,B001P2VNWQ,"Great for beginners. There were some challenging parts to it, but I would like more. Amy's breathless body series are much more intense!",1359763200,,136,4.956521739130435
3737130,5,B001P2VNWQ,"I first discovered Amy Dixon on exerciseTV and always enjoyed her workouts. Now that the channel is defunct, I decided to buy Amy's kickboxing DVD. It's a bit different from the workout that was on exerciseTV - it's longer and includes strength training sections as well as cardio kickboxing. I'm so glad I bought the DVD! The workout is even better than the one featured on TV and is killer. One of my all-time favorites. You'll get a great workout & it's fun! :)",1331251200,2,464,4.535714285714286
3737131,1,B001P2VNWQ,"I was extremely disappointed with this dvd. The only other Amy Dixon dvd I have is the Breathless Body one, which I LOVE.  On Kickin Strength I could not stand Amy's incessant chatter, use of certain phrases over and over again and found her to be quite annoying.  If the workout had been top notch, perhaps I could have overlooked all of that.  I work out most days of the week, either running or doing exercise dvd's.  I've done P90X, Physique 57 as well as numerous others.  I consider myself to be in pretty decent shape, but, hey, I'm 46 years old, so not in my prime!  I found this dvd to be extremely easy, barely worked up a sweat in a couple of places, mostly felt bored and wondered when the workout was going to start.  Found the format of strength/cardio/strength/cardio to be very disjointed.  Plus the of title of the dvd would lead one to believe it was going to be a kick boxing dvd (I am loving kickboxing right now and have quite a few kickboxing dvds); there was actually very little kickboxing.  There were a few new moves I've never seen in a dvd befoore and liked, but they done for such a short time it didn't feel like they did much for me.  I am hoping the seller will let me return this dvd and I am leery to try any more Amy Dixon......",1323388800,5,1263,4.2468619246861925
3737132,5,B001P2VNWQ,ZI love all of Amy Dixons workouts. She is motivating and pushes you to the next level. Exercised are challengning yet easy to perform. Amy is energetic and easy to follow.,1322179200,,172,4.580645161290323
3737133,4,B001P2VNWQ,"I really enjoyed this dvd. When I first bought it I couldn't even finish it and it sat on a shelf collecting dust for 4 or5 months. But I started running and doing her other dvd, give me 10, and decided to give this one a shot again. Now I can finish it
I think Amy is a good instructor, not too perky or arrogant, and she explains the moves well. My only complaint is that I wish it had more arm work. My arms aren't nearly as sore after this dvd as they were after a gyn class I used to attend. But overall I would reccomend this product!",1312070400,2,540,3.918181818181818
3737134,3,B001P2VNWQ,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

Watching preview clips of this workout, I liked the overall moves and was looking forward to trying it.  That said, I was surprised by how much I really disliked this workout by 15 minutes in.

As others have noted, the weird ""I trust"" catch phrase was annoying from the get-go and increasingly annoying with every repeat.  Also, the moves just seemed rather slow and awkward when actually executing them.  After 30 minutes they were sweating buckets and I had not even broken a sweat nor got my heart rate above 100.  I quit and fast forwarded through the rest just to watch it.  Then changed to another workout DVD to get a good workout.

For me, a disappointment.  Perhaps it will work well for beginners working their way up and those who don't mind the catch phrase.",1311897600,5,827,4.609589041095891
3737135,5,B001P2VNWQ,"I do this workout about twice a week, and really, that's all I can manage. I'm a big fan of Amy Dixon, and I like that she works out with you instead of just coaching you. She's bright and motivating, and you'll need it. Unlike her 10 Minute workout DVDs, this one comes with a warm-up, which I like, and it alternates between strength training and pure cardio. I wear a heart rate monitor, and both sessions keep my heart rate up. I know when I want to give up (making the limbo into an exercise is almost criminal), but she's so encouraging that I push right through it.

The DVD has a short warm up and cool down, with two strength sessions and two cardio sessions. The entire set runs about 40 minutes, and Amy gives you cues for when you're about to switch sessions, so it's easy to break it up if you only have a limited amount of time. There's a bonus core workout and yoga stretch session at the end, but I actually prefer some of Amy's other core workouts (the one on ""Give me 10 More"" is killer), so I stick with the kickboxing sessions only. It might take you a few tries to get the rhythms down, but it's a workout anyone can do. Amy's modifier (also named Aimee!) is wonderful, and though she doesn't speak, I love Aimee as well, since she's in all of Amy's DVDs and has been the one I followed until I could build up my strength.

It's a hard workout, but it changes up enough that it doesn't get boring, which is key. I recommend it to anyone who asks me about my workout plan.",1309219200,,1492,4.195121951219512
3737136,5,B001P2VNWQ,"I just got my copy of this video and have only done it once, but I can already say this will become a favorite! I would say it's not for beginners -- but advanced-beginners or intermediate exercisers should do well.  I don't like workouts that are too ""dancey,"" and I also don't like workouts that feel like it's all calisthenics (boring!). But I think Amy does a great job in her videos of landing somewhere in the middle. Some of her combos will take me a few sessions to nail, but overall this a fun video that provides lots of challenges.  Also, I like that it's broken up into segments. Some days I can only fit in a 30-minute workout, so I can easily skip a section or two and end up with just the right amount of time.",1278892800,2,725,4.2086330935251794
3737137,5,B001P2VNWQ,I will buy any DVD Amy puts out because she is an excellent instructor and I love that they are broken up into different segments so I feel like I am actually accomplishing something. You will notice a big difference in your core if you stick with Amy's workouts. I am alternating this with Give Me 10 and Total in Ten. I can't wait for her to make more!,1267056000,5,354,4.144927536231884
3737138,4,B001P2VNWQ,"If you're rhythmically challenged like me, it may take you a few tries to get the steps down. But this is a really good workout. I especially like that you can break it down into a few smaller sessions if you don't have time to do the entire video in one session.",1266364800,,263,4.076923076923077
8331888,5,B001P2VNWQ,Love working out with Amy Dixon. Very addicting,1492819200,,47,5.0
8331889,5,B001P2VNWQ,"If they gave out Academy Awards for exercise DVDs, this would take home top prize!  It's not boring,  which is my biggest complaint with other DVDS. The moves were not too complicated but did require some brain exercising as well. Great job!",1487721600,,241,4.714285714285714
8331890,5,B001P2VNWQ,"This is a good video.  It's fun doing the kickboxing style workout.  It is an excellent legs workout.  The abs portion of the video really kicks my butt.  I usually run, but on rainy days I pop in this DVD and get a good sweat going.",1476316800,,233,4.0
8331891,5,B001P2VNWQ,"Fantastic workout!!  It's impossible to not love Amy Dixon's personality.  She is so motivating.  Plus, this workout isn't the circuit-type that repeats the same exercises over and over, and can get boring.  Amy keeps this entire workout interesting with constantly varying moves.  I just love it, and couldn't be happier with this dvd.",1466899200,,336,5.264150943396227
8331892,5,B001P2VNWQ,the bonus workout in this is great  so are the stretches,1459987200,,56,4.090909090909091
8331893,5,B001P2VNWQ,"I really like this workout because it focuses on all the important aspects of working out - cardio, weight lifting, calisthenics - in one session. And it's fun.",1456358400,,160,4.75
8331894,5,B001P2VNWQ,Great as always,1417046400,,15,4.333333333333333
8331895,5,B001P2VNWQ,Being the woman that finds it very difficult to get up in the morning to do an exercise DVD.... I actually look forward to getting up and doing this one!!! I find that I get bored very quickly with a lot of DVDs with this one I found Amy to be very encouraging and the work out is extremely doable for someone at a intermediate level. I love the fact that you can customize your work out to your schedule!! I also see great results which is amazing!!,1402963200,,450,4.125
8331896,4,B001P2VNWQ,I enjoyed this workout. Just hard enough for a tough end of day workout and not at all boring to say the least!,1390435200,,111,3.869565217391304
8331897,2,B001P2VNWQ,"I was hoping for a true kick boxing workout and was disappointed with this one. It reminded me a lot of the Total Body Workout she did for women's health. I love cardio and wanted more of that on both workouts. This has a lot of good functional strength moves but the kick boxing component just isn't there. The cuing in some spots goes a little too fast to get me to the level of coordination I need to get results. Her best workouts are definitely the breathless series. I own both and use them often. I'm glad I rented this and didn't buy since I already own the Total Body workout. Not bad for beginners, but if you've been exercising for a while, I suggest you spend your time elsewhere.",1383609600,2,692,4.290076335877862
