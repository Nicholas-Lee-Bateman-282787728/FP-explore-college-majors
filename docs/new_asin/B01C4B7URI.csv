7671798,5,B01C4B7URI,"We have waited a long time to see a full Don Quixote with Osipova released. All we had were you tube excerpts available to us. Finally it has arrived.. She does not disappoint us. This is a Nureyev production of it. I must agree that it was somewhat dark staged, however it is well worth owning. I just can't get enough of watching her perform. She is far and above the best there is now. I only wish I had one with Maya in it.",1468627200,,427,4.035294117647059
7671799,5,B01C4B7URI,"The dancing is exquisite!  The plot is silly, but as a ballet, a showcase for dancers. this is one of the very best.",1464134400,2,116,4.043478260869565
7671800,3,B01C4B7URI,"The dancers are very good.  However, in the first act, the colors of the costumes are  so close [red and red orange] that the principals at times don't really stand out from all the folk in the background, particularly in the long shots.  That gets in the way of seeing the dance.  And the sets are pretty dark, making the stage almost claustrophobic.  Compared to the POB production -- same choreography, also great dancers -- this falls short.",1463356800,,445,4.653846153846154
8752147,3,B01C4B7URI,"The only reason why I give it 3 stars and not lower is due to the fantastic two leading dancers. Whoever in charge for filming this DVD has completely missed the point of ballet on DVD: The audience wants to have the same feeling as if we were in the theatre. That does not include close ups on random person on stage while there are other people dancing. It DOES require to include the full body of the dancers in lifts. And please, no camera angles from above to display the skirts while doing pirouettes. We want to see the ballerina's amazing technique. I usually love the first act of Don Q because of the festive atmosphere - but here, I was only annoyed by the things I knew were going on, but was not allowed to see. Funnily enough - in the ages when youtube is overfloaded with amateur movie clips from performances of amazing dancers this professionally filmed version is a huge let down. One might assume that it would increase the quality and ambitions.",1518566400,,965,4.4576271186440675

8752149,5,B01C4B7URI,"Ok, I wasn't going to write a review for this BR, but after reading some of the reviews, I think a couple of them are from someone who didn't actually see this disc play, Osipova is spectacular, every move is polished, every extension is finished, her jumps and spins are something to behold, the photography is excellent as is the video, however it says DTS HD master audio, nope it isn't, and something else that isn't is her partner Leonid Sarafanov, he is unsteady on his feet when he lifts her, and shakes her enough that she looks down on him with concern on her face, she needs a partner that's stronger, Nureyev's version is (as might be expected) slanted toward the female dancers, and makes short shrift of the male's, that's ok if you like that sort of change to the choreography, and many do, if you are one of them, do yourself a favor and see the Baryshnikov-Harvey DVD and see if you still feel the same about it. if it wasn't for Osipova's brilliant dancing I would not have given 5 stars, more like 3",1509235200,,1017,4.414893617021277
8752150,5,B01C4B7URI,"Don Quixote is an odd ballet.  The main character, a walking role, is there only to provide a pretext for the real story, of the love of a village girl and a barber.  Her father and her foppish suitor get in the way, but the happy ending is never in doubt.  Basically, this Don Q is a vehicle for absolutely brilliant dancing, which is what we get here.  The Minkus music, with additions by Drigo, is one of the truly great ballet scores.
Natalia Osipova needs a powerful partner to counterbalance her own great power, and in Leonid Sarafanov she has one. They do wonders with Rudolf Nureyev's brilliant, difficult choreography, and their acting is superb.  They differentiate, as is very important, between Basilio's flirting and Kitri's.  Basilio is in love with Kitri, but he's a great skirt-chaser and will pursue any girl in sight.  Kitri, in contrast, is completely devoted to Basilio, and she flirts with other men only to make him jealous.  They are also capable of great romantic lyricism, as in the forest scene.  There is magic in Don Q's vision the dryads and their Queen, and of Kitri as Dulcinea.  Of the several Don Quixote I have seen, this La Scala production is the greatest.",1502064000,,1193,4.6650717703349285
8752151,1,B01C4B7URI,"Brought Blu Ray and May and just open to sit back and enjoy the dancing of Osipova and Sarafanov.  To my Amazement, it does not play.
Please open and review Blu Ray the minute you receive it since this was the fault I made.

Trying to find out if I can get a replacement from Amazon",1500508800,,282,4.017857142857143

Very disappointed. I would call this performance ""the red and purple ballet.!",1469750400,2,253,5.170731707317073
