7840222,5,6303184197,"Based on Vigo 's personal childhood experiences, this admirable, beloved and poetic work constitutes a superb and precise outlaw portrait of a boarding school. Vigo creates a claustrophobic world filled of tension in which the petty tyrannies of the school regime stand in sharp relief against the natural fantasy and tender delirium of the children. There is a lot of psychological insights, this landmark was banned in France until 1946.

If you really want to start a anthological collection, you must not ignore this milestone picture that in certain way would anticipate the French New Wave and influenced a countless films.

Jean Vigo was a monumental talent who missed too soon. His filmic heritage were just only two films, but his grandness is acknowledged all over the world and specially by the French Cinema that reserved every year a Festival in his memory.

A genius who shines with own light in the Universe of the supreme Gods of the Cinema",1129593600,,956,4.9625

In 'Zero In Conduct', it seems he finally  gets to live out a fantasy of childhood rebellion, probably one in which  many have shared. There are many beautiful and innovative shots, including  the gorgeous slow-motion march through the falling feathers. It occurred to  me that Francois Truffaut may have seen this film before he made 'The 400  Blows'. Highly recommended for fans of 'L'Atalante', however the  'International Film Series' version sold here at Amazon is a very  low-quality print, so be careful.",941068800,7,619,5.13
