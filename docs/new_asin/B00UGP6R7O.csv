This is a dramatization of the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962. The attempted invasion of Cuba in 1961 at the Bay of Pigs was a failure. This led to the decision to place Soviet rockets in Cuba to protect the Castro regime. When the American government discovered this by the use of high-flying U-2 airplanes or satellites, their immediate concern was to stop these missiles. There were two choices: an attack to bomb and destroy the missile bases, or, to blockade the Soviet ships that brought these armaments. The first would require a sneak attack on a small country and then an invasion; this would offend world opinion and be different from past American policy. It could also result in a military escalation elsewhere in the world, possibly a nuclear World War. How can this crisis be solved?

This story presents the history of this event that was unknown to the American people at the time. Those who were adults at that time remembered the fear that kept some people home that day. They expected WW III and wanted to be with their families. Fortunately, Kennedy and Khrushchev found a compromise solution that let them stand down and resolve the crisis. But some criticized the actions afterwards. Kennedy was removed as President a year later; some say it was a long gunman. Khrushchev was removed as Premier in 1964. There was a new crisis in Vietnam that wasted lives and money for over a decade. Conflicts continue, even if shooting wars are episodic. The current threat is from terrorists, where one or more men can threaten many people. Were JFKs actions reckless in supporting the Bay of Pigs invasion? He followed the advice of military experts. This was foolish, even if others would have done the same. One effect was to arrange a teletype machine for direct contact between Washington and Moscow.

Back in the early days of TV there was a popular program called You Are There that dramatized historical events as entertainment or education. This kind of drama should be more common as fewer people read history books. There is a reference to The Guns of August by Barbara Tuchman, a popular history of that time, about the start of WW I.
