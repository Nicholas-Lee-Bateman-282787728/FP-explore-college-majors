1037472,5,6305381127,"Very good action movie, with excellent acting by Mark Dacascos.  He brings depth and intensity to the role, and with a look can you can tell his thoughts and emotional state.  I am also very impressed with his ability to play different characters in his movies, instead of playing the same character over and over like some of the more famous actors.",1018915200,9,350,4.629032258064516
1037473,2,6305381127,"THE BASE is an overall average film. Clearly the actors' talents are not put to full use. Mark Dacascos' excellent martial arts skills are supressed to appear like a good street fighter, not the impressive military weapon he is suppose to portray. The story line is interesting, but is weakened by the poor ending of this action film. The good guy wins, but it is a dismal victory. The nudity added to The Base does not really flow with the story line. The director clearly failed in this film. The acting in this film is very good, but the camera angles were not. I'm sure the actors were disappointed with the final product. THE BASE is worth seeing once. I suggest renting versus buying.",993254400,13,690,4.57258064516129

7890295,4,6305381127,"""The Base"" is from a period in Mark Dacascos's filmography regularly highlighted by decent stories, good production values, and limited action, and this one exemplifies all of these qualities. It's a mildly exciting action-thriller with some highlights in its script, and it manages to secure a high rating by avoiding many direct-to-video snafus and pitfalls. Nevertheless, it's a little dull and not quite the ideal Dacascos vehicle.

The story: An Army Major (Dacascos) goes undercover to investigate a drug trafficking ring led by a dangerous Sergeant (Tim Abell).

Much of the film's overall quality seems to be attributable to director Mark Lester, who to this day remains on the same downward slide from his heyday of directing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Commando/dp/B000K0YLM8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Commando</a>&nbsp;but nevertheless injects invaluable energy into the picture - making the most of what would otherwise have been a much more run-of-the-mill outing with a low budget. The script has some basic shortcomings, including the thankless and clich&eacute;d role it renders Paula Trickey (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pacific-Blue/dp/B005X7HA8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pacific Blue</a>), but I was pleased with the surprising depth that Tim Abell's character is granted. Abell pulls it off fairly well, doing a good job of playing a manipulator and appearing absolutely authentic as a military man.

Dacascos is on less even ground: he tends to play awkward villains to begin with, and does no better in playing a hero pretending to be a villain. Nevertheless, he's in good form when it comes to the action. I wish that there were more than three fistfights, a handful of shootouts, and a couple explosions, but by and large, this stuff is serviceable. Mark throws a lot of spinning kicks and at times appears to be channeling his rarely-utilized capoeira training. I particularly enjoyed the first brawl, wherein Dacascos takes on Darcas Macopson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chill-Factor/dp/B00003RQKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chill Factor</a>) in a surprisingly dirty kendo duel. The finale between Mark and Tim Abell is yards better than anything they got up to in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Instinct-to-Kill/dp/B000A2X3X4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Instinct to Kill</a>.

If there's one major flaw to the movie, it's that it does not take any chances. The filmmakers may have been trying to replicate the big-budget experience for the small screen, though they would arguably have been much better served producing a movie less homogenized and predictable, as is allowed by the DTV medium. Nevertheless, if you're a viewer who complains about the failings of B-movies, then the solid, conventional route this one takes will probably be considered a plus factor. Dacascos fans are encouraged to check it out.",1435622400,3,3017,6.193317422434368

The agent is now up against his own colleagues and it is his word against theirs. This is definitely a new approach that touches on a touchy subject.
