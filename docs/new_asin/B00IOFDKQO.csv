8644150,3,B00IOFDKQO,"If technology had advanced enough to allow little robotic figures to have intelligence, personality and movement, how would that world be? Well, that's the global state of affairs, but the series is focused on the little lives of four that are owned by a high school boy. The dolls are little in a big world, having to deal with making lunch, shopping, and occasional grand adventures, like traveling across country, dealing with thieves, and even terrorists. No matter how big, the stories wrap quickly, giving a small scale to he episodes that's neat and clean. The focus is on getting a good look at their world, and it's good.  Though, the episodes can occasionally stray to the potentially magical, complete with a doll becoming human and a ghostly master - I can't decide if I like this or not. Details abound, but in the constraints of an episode, they might be left unexplored, like the cat in the city of masterless dolls. Though, they deal well with doll concepts, like what happens when there's multiples of one doll, what do they eat, and can they have jobs; so the series is well focused in that respect. Of all the dolls, I feel the closest to the fourth to join the group. She's a fighter, but their master doesn't use his dolls to fight. In retrospect, I'm kind of glad that the series went in the direction it did. Another fighting anime would have been obvious, and boring. There are quite a few blazing fast fights here, but the focus is more on the day-to-day lives of the dolls. The animation and Japanese voice acting is good; there is a bit of fanservice, kind of. The camera seems fascinated with their joints. In summary, good, but lacking punch.",1490140800,,1671,4.626262626262626

Though he doesn't let them fight in competitions, they still have adventures galore.  These little robots are likable, funny, silly, and loyal to their owner.",1434758400,2,283,5.130434782608695
