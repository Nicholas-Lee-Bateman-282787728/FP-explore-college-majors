1110111,5,6305883653,"This Mexican popgroup performs very well on stage and on their albums.  When I first heard from Mana (Donde Jugaran Los Ninos, not on this DVD), I  thought I heard the Police singing in Spanish. For sure, you will enjoy  listening this DVD in Dolby 5.1 and watching this inspiring musicians  making a 'pure' show. Mana could be the next Ricky Martin or Jennifer Lopez  breaking out Latin and South America.",965433600,15,406,4.661971830985915
1110112,5,6305883653,"Si ya escucho el CD o disfruto de la transmision de este concierto por MTV, entoces no tengo nada que decir: Es lo mejor que se le ha podido ocurrir a los chicos de MANA. Editar este magnifico concierto en DVD con  sonido Dolby Digital 5.1. ES GRANDIOSO! . No puede faltar en su coleccion.  MTV deberia editar todos los conciertos UNPLUGGED que tienen en sus  archivos en este formato. Se los Recomiendo.",964656000,10,404,4.506849315068493

1110114,5,6305883653,"After I heard the CD last year,I made the effort to  wait all this time to see and hear Man&aacute; on DVD because I know they always put on a great show. And  I give  it a 5-star rating also because of the great sound (both on  5.1 and 2-ch), and the honest interviews that Fher and the band gave.",959644800,10,298,3.9166666666666665
1110115,5,6305883653,"I spent a year working in South America and purchased Mana's double-live CD entitled ""En Vivo"" on a ""hunch"".  I was amazed by the group's unique blend of rock, reggae and jazz fusion! Wow! A lifetime  fan of Santana, Clapton, Marley and Zepplin, MANA is a household name from  Mexico to Punta Arenas.  Their passionate lyrics coupled with their  independent style are a tribute to their heritage and excellence as  musicians.  This Ungplugged performance is outstanding!  A few songs;  ""Te Solte la Rienda"" by legendary Jose Alfredo Jimmenez is my  favorite cover! The Pier of San Blas (El Muelle de San Blas) is about a  women waiting for her long lost sailor/lover to return. Vivir Sin Aire  (Live without Air) is another favorite. Discover the next big crossover  artists-Mana! Disfruta! Enjoy!",959385600,2,797,4.99236641221374
1110149,5,6305883653,"Mana's music style can get you involved into it, and in this DVD we can see how profesional they are. Sound and music quality are the features of this Latin style pop rock and this DVD.",1132358400,,185,4.166666666666667

1110151,4,6305883653,"I've been buying CD's of the group Mana since about 1995.  This DVD has many of my favorite songs.

To me, it seems like this DVD is a compilation of most of their mellower songs.  As a result, I would think that anyone listening would find the music on this DVD enjoyable.

I was a little annoyed by the recording quality because I felt that they had cut too much of the main singer's voice and the drums out.

This recording is done with a live set of musicians for the violins and other non-rock instruments.  I could be wrong, but I would guess that the person in charge of mixing the music favored the instrumental side of the recording and made the mistake of not letting the group be what they really are, that is the best damn rock group in Mexico.

Final conclusion:  They shouldn't have cut the vocals and drums so much, but it's still a good DVD.",1107734400,6,857,4.279503105590062
1110152,5,6305883653,"Mana takes it all off and showcases some of their best songwriting in its most primitive form. From the heartbreaking song of ""El Muelle De San Blas"" to the struggle of ""Ana"", Mana delivers their performance on this DVD in a simple, elegant, yet powerful style that grips the viewer from start to finish. A definite must-have not only for Mana fans, but for any fan of Spanish Rock. The interviews with all four members opens a new window and lets viewers understand a glimpse of where each band member draws their inspiration for their songwriting. A++++",1071187200,4,555,4.731958762886598
1110153,5,6305883653,"Thank you Carlos Santana for introducing me to Mana.
The Unplugged DVD is great. Lots of their hits and more.
Alex was really holding back on his usual power druming and does it as grand as ever.
Juan was all there and cool.
Sergio has more than just talent and shows it in his guitar preformance.
Fher! Fher is great, great, and great!",1060128000,,336,4.349206349206349

1110155,5,6305883653,"I'm a recent convert to Mana, but I learned one thing very quickly--their live performances are incredible!  To me, the Unplugged DVD is a classic because of the mix of songs and the energy and purity of the entire performance.  Both the CD and the DVD showcase what Mana is all about, and that is making great music. If you have any interest in Latino music, this is a must-have for your collection!",1046995200,3,400,4.465753424657534
