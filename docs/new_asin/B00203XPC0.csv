8348428,2,B00203XPC0,"Nazty Nuisance is really something--something else, that is! The plot is not deep or very meaningful although I give credit to the principal actors who, for the most part, turn in fairly good performances. Of course, anyone who wants to see Hitler, Mussolini and Japanese top brass from World War Two getting pushed around will like this film; but even then this film is so silly you can't even take that message seriously. On the other hand, the action moves along at a good pace and the cinematography and choreography are actually pretty good. In addition, the musical score fits in well with the scenes no matter how ridiculous and juvenile some of them are!

When the action starts, we quickly meet Hitler himself (Bobby Watson) who tells his high command he is leaving Germany to sign a secret treaty with Chief Paj Mab (Ian Keith) who lives on an island with his tribe. Although Hitler warns his men not to tell Mussolini (Joe Devlin) or Japanese commander Suki Yaki (Johnny Arthur), the two other Axis leaders have Hitler all figured out and insist on joining Hitler when he sails by submarine to meet Chief Paj Mab, much to Hitler's chagrin.

Meanwhile, a small crew from an American warship manages to escape after their ship has been torpedoed and they come across the same island where Chief Paj Mab lives with his people. They soon realize that Hitler is coming to the island and somehow a drunken magician, his young female assistant Kela (Jean Porter), an American sailor named Benson (Frank Faylen) all cross paths with the effect of Benson posing as the magician with Kela at his side while the chief entertains the Axis leaders before signing any treaties.

There's more to the plot than this but I'll stop here to avoid giving away spoilers--even with a silly film there can be a few surprises! Suffice it to say that the rest of this relatively short film shows how everything plays out.

Look for Rex Evans as Hermann Goering; Wedgwood Nowell as Heinrich Himmler and Charley Rogers as Josef Goebbels. Henry Rowland has a brief cameo as a Nazi submarine radio officer.

Overall, Nazty Nuisance is something for fans of the actors in it and anyone who wants to watch a movie that isn't terribly cerebral might want to get this film. However, people who want truly good comedies about World War Two may want to skip this and enjoy other films including To Be or Not to Be and The Goose Steps Out.",1365984000,,2414,4.670588235294118
8348429,3,B00203XPC0,"During World War 2 a lot of anti-Nazi films appeared, but only a very few of them were comedies (e.g., ""To be or Not to Be"", ""The Great Dictator"", ""The Goose Steps Out"", ""Once Upon a Honeymoon""). The problem is that evil, death and destruction do not necessarily go well in a comedy. Of course, something like ""Stalag 17"" (1953) and ""Hogan's Heroes"" (1965-71) were the exception to the rule, but they didn't come out until after the War.

""Natzy Nuisance"" falls into a small subgroup of broad comedies, many of them shorts (""You Natzy Spy"", I""ll Never Heil Again"", ""The Devil with Hitler""), which poke fun at the Axis. ""Nuisance"" is from the Hal Roach (1892-1992) studios, but don't expect the quality of his Harold Lloyd, Our Gang, or Laurel and Hardy series. ""Nuisance"" was part of the Roach ""streamliners"" - 40 to 50 minute films designed for double bills, and he used his repertoire actors to crank them out.

In this quirky comedy, Hitler, Mussolini, and General Suki Yaki visit an Island nation to negotiate a treaty.

Frank Faylen (1905-85) plays a stranded US sailor who plays tricks on the three Axis leaders. Faylen appeared in almost 200 films, including ""The Lost Weekend"" (1945), ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946), and ""Road to Rio"" (1947). In the 50s he made the transition to TV where he appeared as the father in ""The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis"" (1959-63).

Bobby Watson (1888-1965) has the distinction of playing Hitler in 9 films.

Joe Devlin (1894-1973) is a riot as Mussolini, a role he played in several other films - ""The Devil with Hitler"" (1942), ""The Got me Covered"" (1943) , ""The Miracle of Morgan Creek"" (1944). He bore a striking resemblance to Curly, of ""3 Stooges"" fame, and most of his 150+ film roles were comedies.

Pretty and perky Jean Porter (1925) plays a magician's assistant. Her biggest claim to fame was marrying director Edward Dmytryk.

The film relies on a lot of verbal humor, and you can't go wrong with an Ape. Though it is completely silly, I couldn't help but laugh.",1363824000,,2012,4.698863636363637

8348431,2,B00203XPC0,"First a word about privately manufactured DVDs--
Often, these transfers are of a quality similar to budget box brands. The films themselves are unrestored and rarely pristine yet still watchable (unless there's an inordinate number of repaired breaks). Extras are non-existent and inclusion of artwork or liner notes varies by manufacturer. These niche companies can provide a valuable outlet for movies unavailable anywhere else.

After Hal Roach released SAPS AT SEA (1940), he dismissed for good the troublesome Stan Laurel and his partner Oliver Hardy. This left a huge hole at the top of the company's acting roster, one partially filled by ""loaners"" from other studios or unaffiliated actors. In 1942, Roach began producing ""streamliner"" westerns, as well as contributing to the studio's long slapstick legacy with the addition of Bobby Watson and Joe Devlin. These two portrayed Hitler and Mussolini in a couple of Roach shorts, beginning with THE DEVIL WITH HITLER.

NAZTY NUISANCE is the sequel to that streamliner.

SYNOPSIS--
Silly mediocrity has Adolf H. and two other Axis leaders on a secret mission to sign a treaty wih an Arab sheik. Their plans are undone by an American sailor who's good at magic tricks.
