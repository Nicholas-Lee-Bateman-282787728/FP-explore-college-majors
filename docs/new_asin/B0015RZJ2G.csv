8259751,5,B0015RZJ2G,I love the whole series and have them all. I cannot tell you why but this is very addictive and I cannot get enough.,1354924800,,116,3.875
8259752,5,B0015RZJ2G,"amazon special deal huh, special way to rip you off, do the math they offer a 3 piece bundle for 80.99, episodes 1, 2, and 3, if you buy them individually their 11.99 each, so really 3 episodes are only 36 dollars, wow what a savings. 4o something more. I bought 1 through 5 for 60 dollars and some change. by the way very exciting show to watch, 10 plus",1272758400,,354,4.071428571428571

8259754,2,B0015RZJ2G,"I was very disappointed that The Deadliest Catch is 'bleeped' on DVDs for home sale.  I didn't mind on TV...but did not expect the retail DVDs to be bleeped...and there is no rating shown on the selling site to warn you.  I wanted the whole series, but won't buy any more.  It's not that I love swearing, either!  I guess it's just the awful 'bleeping', and fuzzing over the mouth..it makes me wish to just hear what they're saying.  I just think we should have a choice.",1254960000,3,471,4.367816091954023
8259755,5,B0015RZJ2G,"I purchased season 1 through 3 to catch up with the show as I just started watching it.  I was not disappointed.  If you are a fan of this show, you will love the DVD's.",1251244800,,169,3.8
8259756,4,B0015RZJ2G,"The Deadliest Catch is a great series and the DVD's are almost just as they aired on TV, with the exception of the opening theme music, which overall is not that important. The only thing I wish there was more of on these DVD's is the ""After the Catch"" follow-up shows &/or more Behind the scenes foootage.",1230768000,3,306,4.385964912280702
8259757,1,B0015RZJ2G,"Am I missing something?  Amazon offers seasons 1 & 2 for $18.99 each and season 3 for $19.99 - a total of $57.97.  Then the three season set is priced at $80.99 - $24.02 more than buying them individually.  Is there something different about the three DVD sets?

(The rating with review is for the price and not the program.)",1214265600,10,325,4.366666666666666
