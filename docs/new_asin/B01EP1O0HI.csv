8759318,5,B01EP1O0HI,"Great anime. Definitely one to add to the collection.  You have  a mix of love and war. Maybe too much war. Like all war, no one seemed sure what they were fighting for. Maybe, I didn't understand what they were fighting for. Heroes die and the protagonist gets to be with the man she loves in the end.",1489190400,,302,4.189655172413793

8759321,5,B01EP1O0HI,"Great sequel to the first movie. If you're expecting it to be identical to the second season of the anime series, it's different, but personally I liked the different path/angles explored. I may have liked this movie a teensy bit more though.",1473984000,,242,4.785714285714286
8759322,3,B01EP1O0HI,"Idea good, execution poor. Beautiful animation and fight scenes, but it's a mish-mash of scenes from various routes with different twists and with a whole lot of Kazama (which is nice, but executed in a confusing manner). If you're a die hard fan then you may still want to watch it, but since I enjoyed the first movie so much (despite it being condensed) I expected a bit more out of this one.",1472083200,,395,4.424657534246576
