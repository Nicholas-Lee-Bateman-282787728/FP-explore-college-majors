3803714,2,B001US0MMW,"I was looking for a DVD that had a lot of the exercises that my chiropractor wanted me to do.  I was hoping I could get myself to do them if I could follow it on a DVD.  This DVD does have a lot of those exercises but this DVD is so unprofessional I just find it annoying.  Having seen that Suzanne Andrews had made so many exercise DVDs I was expecting a very professional and high quality DVD.  Especially for the price.  It is not.  I have exercised to Winsor Pilates and Leslie Sansone and was expecting something of that quality.  Instead it seemed like a video made in a basement, with no flow and it is very choppy.  I also think she could have put a little more effort into choosing her exercise clothes.  Yuck!",1257033600,,719,4.189781021897811

Functional Fitness Pain Free Back and Neck is a lot cheaper than me going to gym and fighting the traffic to get there. My doctor recommended if I wanted pain relief to do physical therapy or pain killers and I chose this DVD, since Suzanne Andrews has an education in rehab therapy. The difference between Suzanne Andrews DVD's is that her DVD's come with a medical foundation that offers a rehab therapy approach most other DVD's don't. I'm 50 years old, a couch potato at heart and I found this DVD easy to follow. I incorporated the DVD workout into my daily routine and I got tremendous relief from my pain and that is priceless. There is one workout for your back and one workout for your neck and they are only 25 minutes long so it's easy to find the time. I also figured out that I can skip the couple minute introduction at the beginning by simply pressing my skip button and the DVD goes directly to the beginning of the exercise program.  The biggest change is being able to sleep through the night because I'm no longer in pain and that is worth a lot more to me than 19.99! I spent a lot more on that on pain medication.",1253404800,,1694,6.173728813559322
3803716,3,B001US0MMW,"For what it is, I think this DVD is over-priced, which is why I gave it only 3 stars.  These exercises for neck and back pain/problems are effective but can be found in any good stretch routine.  Also, those of us who are already educated as to our conditions do not need all the chummy talk that precedes the actual exercises and takes up time; we need to get moving. I am glad, however, that other reviewers have found relief using the program; to them it's probably worth the price.",1248652800,2,485,4.377777777777778
3803717,5,B001US0MMW,"Suzanne Andrews walks her talk.  She's got the expertise and enthusiasm to get you motivated.  Her DVD is simple to follow and you can do it to music. Functional Fitness is a gift you should give to yourself, friends and family.",1246838400,,228,4.536585365853658
3803718,5,B001US0MMW,"I have begun her program and I have noticed a tremendous difference in a short period of time. It doesn't take a lot of time, it is easy, and she makes it fun.  If you have back or neck issues, consider looking at this DVD. This would make a great gift for family and friends.",1245110400,2,276,4.0181818181818185

8344863,4,B001US0MMW,"I enjoyed this... I only wished it was a longer running DVD . I joined bone builder but was uncomfortable  with 70, 80 year olds.. but at least the class ran over 45 minutes of exercise",1389052800,2,185,4.138888888888889
8344864,5,B001US0MMW,"This is a simple video and i mostly use the neck section. The neck section is 20 minutes long. When i do these exercises they really do help my stiff neck and stiff shoulders. I was watching Suzanne's show on public television but it is not on anymore. I have neck and shoulder pain from my repetitive motion type job. The stretches really do help. This is a simple video, there are more professional videos some people may not like it, but i like it.",1370217600,12,451,4.317647058823529
8344865,5,B001US0MMW,"Suzanne, I must tell you how your exercise programs have changed my life!  I am 75 years old, suffering from arthritis. After breaking a collar bone two years ago and undergoing extensive physical therapy, I was still in pain.  Before beginning your exercise routines, I couldn't do many of the things I enjoy, such as gardening and hiking.  Now, after a few months of your exercises, I am able to enjoy these activities again.  The neck exercises are wonderful for strengthening my neck and shoulder muscles, and have helped to eliminate a lot of headaches as well.  I feel like I am finally on the road to recovery, thanks to you!",1365552000,10,632,4.657657657657658

My video is not professional, but I'm not great with cameras.  Their video is great quality though.

8344867,5,B001US0MMW,"I would like to thank functional fitness for this wonderful video.  It is a excellent way to exercise for 20 mins. right in your own home. I find disciplining myself to do these exercises on a consistent basis every day not only promote flexibility but strengthens the movements for a pain free neck. It is definitely therapeutic!
After doing the ""pain free neck"" excercise series for about 2 yrs. I can truly testify that it helps to not only relieve but release tension.  If you have stress in your life this really works.  I have  learned from the exercise video and my own personal experience from being under stress that pain really does settle/live in the neck area.  Suzanne's instruction is like having a one on one coaching or personal training session that has relaxing music, voice for encouragement/coaching techniques, and its effective and most of all fun! She definitely puts the ""function"" in fitness for all ages.",1310860800,4,930,4.860759493670886
8344868,1,B001US0MMW,"All I can say is, Seriously? Is this really a serious attempt at healing pain? The exercises were ridiculous. I do them without thinking while sitting at my chair anyway. Do you need to spend $20 on a DVD to do these? The videography is extremely poor. I think there was even a few times when the instructor forgot what she was doing and did the wrong thing. Functional Fitness is a name I believed in. There is no functionality to this, nor will you gain any fitness. Save your money.",1306800000,,485,4.34065934065934

8344870,5,B001US0MMW,"I happened across a Functional Fitness sample on YouTube and was intrigued by the various forms of the exercises offered. My mom had injured her shoulder and could barely use it for nearly a year. And having little patients for a physical therapist she wanted to do all of the work at home.

I got one of the shows for her to use as a starting point and it really seemed to help. She has nearly full use of her arm again and was able to work her way from easy to advanced while seeing her progression and says Suzanne's energy is addictive. The real exciting thing is that she even has my dad working out with her with THIS dvd, for their back and neck (both generally sore from injuries for years ago). Their only complaint is that occasionally the transition between standing and sitting exercises are a bit quick. She sometimes has to pause the dvd to lay out her mat.

But, she enjoys it enough that she has ordered several more of the dvds.

I would love to see a full collection of the dvds available for order rather than buying them individually.",1258243200,,1054,4.36734693877551
