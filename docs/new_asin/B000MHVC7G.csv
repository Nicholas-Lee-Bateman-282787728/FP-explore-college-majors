I bought it at the Mount St. Helens visitor center thinking it would be a keeper, but would have been better off just putting a twenty in the NPS donation box.",1466812800,,397,4.838235294117647

SH), buy this film.  It's the best recap of this event I have seen.  (There are some decent ones on YouTube, but not like this one.)",1396656000,,369,4.333333333333333
