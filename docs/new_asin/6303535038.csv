7851532,5,6303535038,"Why do I love this movie? I do actually for some reason. Love John Howard in practically anything he did in the 30's or 40's, he was a terribly underrated actor who had everything needed to be a male film star (handsome, high baritone voice, 5'10"", and of course talent), and yet he's legacy today rests mostly on two performances, one miscast (or badly scripted) as Ronald Colman's brother in 'Lost Horizon' (1937), the other as Katherine Hepburn's ultimately discarded fianc in ""The Philadelphia Story"" (1940). I've seen MANY of his performances, and when given a chance he comes off much better than in his two showcase roles, especially in comedic roles or as Bulldog Drummond. Considering how he came to Hollywood at age 22 and already had the maturity of a man a decade older than himself, it is a true shame that he was overlooked by the major studios. Ellen Drew is, well Ellen Drew which is to say beautiful. Anthony Quinn is the closest thing to a true villain in the film, although even he gains some sympathy. Over all I enjoyed this film, it is funny, short, and has a good story which is a must for one of these programmer type films.",1392768000,,1148,4.550724637681159

Directed by James P. Hogan

Old Mrs. Dangerfield (May Robson) is experiencing a rash of cattle rustling at her White Sage ranch and, fed up with her no-good grandson Carter's handling of the emergency, she contacts an old beau, Ranger Captain Ben Cadwallader of the Texas Rangers. Cadwallader assigns young Ranger Jim Kingston (John Howard) to infiltrate the gang. Kingston masquerades as The Pecos Kid on the lam. Filmed on location at Mesa, Arizona.

Although not a direct sequel, this well-apportioned B-Western from Paramount was produced to capitalize on the popularity of the studio's The Texas Rangers (1936). Unlike the earlier film, this one is set in the (then) modern times of the late 1930s - so we get cars and planes here and the Rangers often drive into the wild with their horses in a trailer in back -- much like the early days of Gene Autry and Roy Rogers.

This film, more so than its predecessor provided the template for the successful Joel McCrea Radio Series and the TV Series both of which were titled Tales of the Texas Rangers,

7851534,3,6303535038,"To its credit, Paramount Pictures has rarely stinted on funding for its lower tier films as evidenced with this work that is meant to profit from the popularity of the 1936 MacMurray/Oakie picture TEXAS RANGERS, of which this is not a sequel. Far from having a conventional Western setting, the plot here is contemporaneous with the time of the film's release, with cattle rustlers employing motor vehicles and wireless communication, as do the Rangers who also trailer their mounts to their patrol sectors. By utilizing some of its better contract players as well as a raft of supporting actors whose home studio is Paramount, a product is developed that is fairly well balanced between the common cinematic classifications of romance, comedy and adventure. As Ellen Dangerfield (Ellen Drew) arrives at the enormous White Sage Ranch in Texas after being ten years away on the east coast, her grandmother's spread is being rustled of thousands of cattle, causing the elderly lady (May Robson) to request assistance from the Texas Rangers who have a nearby base, with Ranger Jim Kingston (John Howard) being assigned to the case in an undercover capacity that allows him as a ranch hand to woo as he may wish a not unwilling Ellen. With partner Mace (Broderick Crawford), Jim pinpoints a sophisticated rustling operation led by a local meatpacking company owner and abetted by traitorous lawbreakers from among White Sage cowboys. There is abundant action as Rangers and rustlers vie for survival, yet through it all humourous episodes occur that pleasantly colour the proceedings, with city-tarnished Ellen weakly trying to find cause why she should not respond to the aggressively amourous Kingston. The mentioned components of romance, comedy and adventure are not uniformly or consistently effective, not to fault a talented cast that serves well the screenplay, including Anthony Quinn, Akim Tamiroff, Robert Ryan, supporting performers Charles Lane, Edward Pawley, Joseph Crehan, with Western genre veterans such as Tom Tyler, Monte Blue, Jack Perrin and Eddie Acuff among a host of other worthies. Robson earns acting honours with her spirited performance while notice must be made of the stuntmen, who shine in this fast moving film shot in and near Mesa, Arizona, a blessing to Archie Stout, a cinematographer whose better work is logged outdoors, while Arthur Schmidt's clean editing and the familiar thematic scoring from the 1936 movie cap a satisfactory production that also is notable for its careful attention to continuity details.",1152748800,,2546,5.257985257985258
