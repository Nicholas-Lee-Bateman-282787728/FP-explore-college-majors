8195275,4,B000083XJ6,I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the video on the DVD considering its age and some of the reviews I had read from other sites. Various instructors perform the Katas and there is some bunkai (thogh not extensive). This is certainly worth the money and good addition to the enthusiest.,1287619200,,295,4.6923076923076925

8195277,5,B000083XJ6,"Th rare historical footage on this DVD is priceless. These are the famous and now deceased shotokan masters demonstrating their art as it should be done. I appreciate the opportunity to own such rare footage even though it was originally shot on 8mm film, which was the technology available at the time of filming,I found the content worth viewing.  I was able to learn much from the footage and own all three volumes.",1096502400,,418,4.726027397260274
8195278,1,B000083XJ6,This was a home produced DVD with stuck on label. It wouldn't play in either my computer's DVD drive or my home DVD player. Useless. But as I live in the UK the cost of return to the US is prohibitive. Keep your cash in your pocket and learn from my bad experience.,1076630400,3,265,4.018867924528302
