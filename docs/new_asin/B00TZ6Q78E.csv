7026176,4,B00TZ6Q78E,"Great family movie. Lots of fun, the dog is a treasure, so is the actor playing Paula. It has the feel of a made for TV movie, but somehow you are pulled beyond it into the story line.",1444694400,,184,3.8684210526315788

7026179,1,B00TZ6Q78E,you would think a movie that is from true events would have been made better. It is a long boring movie,1442620800,,103,3.9523809523809526

7026182,4,B00TZ6Q78E,"Overall this is a good movie, especially for families who prefer not to watch movies with vulgar or suggestive content.  No bad language, a positive message and some genuine fun in a few places. The lead actress (Mindy Raymond) is the standout--lots of charm and spunk, but some of the other performances are melodramatic and amateurish.  It's also obvious in a couple places during the pistol-slinging that a stand-in is doing the work (most likely the real-life Pistol Packin' Paula).  Even so, the technical flaws and B-List talent do not overwhelm a solid family-friendly movie.",1441152000,6,582,5.105263157894737

7026185,5,B00TZ6Q78E,Very good family movie!  Would highly recommend it to anyone!  Mindy (Paula) lights up the room my kids loved her!  I think more movies of this kind need to be on shelves today buy it worth every dime you will spend!,1438387200,,216,4.219512195121951
7026203,5,B00TZ6Q78E,"I love this movie! We need more family-friendly movies such as the ""Adventures of P&P. The movie targets young girls and effectively stresses the philosophy that people need to work hard to achieve their dreams. Mindy Raymond has a smile that lights up the screen and was very believable as Paula. The gun twirling was fun to watch. All of the ancillary characters added nicely to the story, and every one of them was well placed in their roles. The soundtrack is awesome. I found myself tapping my shoes to all of them.",1436140800,5,520,4.602150537634409

8703429,5,B00TZ6Q78E,Great family film! our little girl is obsessed with this movie and with Pistol Packin' Paula! The movie is an inspiring story and has a great message to persevere and follow your dreams. The acting is excellent and the music is as well. We have been so blessed to meet Paula and she has taken the time to encourage our daughter and teach her many stunts performed in the movie. Highly recommend this pure entertainment!,1447027200,3,419,4.6
