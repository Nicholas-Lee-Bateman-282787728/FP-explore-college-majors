8689032,5,B00PR2VKUU,"I initially read Mr. Howell's ""Painting with Oils"" book and noticed his watercolor sketches were amazing. After Googling his watercolor paintings, I fell in love with his loose impressionistic style and had to learn more of his methods. His watercolor book scheduled to be published by the end of 2015 seems delayed so I got this DVD instead while waiting.  Mr. Howell is an amazing teacher and he is very generous with sharing his tips on what colors/pigments he uses, which colors he combine/charge for effective recession/gradation, and using simple shapes to describe the scenes to avoid fiddling that could ruin atmospheric painting. Many of his tips were discussed in the aforementioned oil painting book, but it was nice to witness in action performed by a master. I feel I got my money's worth after viewing this DVD , and grateful that I don't have to travel to UK to observe how he paints with his squirrel mop, sables, rigger, and even a stick! This is a gem of an instruction for any watercolor enthusiasts.",1454371200,,1019,4.822857142857143
8689033,5,B00PR2VKUU,"Just Watercolor DVD by David Howell is excellent. He does not draw on the watercolor paper, but he does a sketch with pencil and colored pencil on drawing paper. This allows him to paint directly on the watercolor paper. He uses limited colors and, for the most part, mixes the colors wet in wet on the watercolor paper. His instruction is easy to follow. I just wish a digital version were available to download into my tablet. I read that he will be publishing a book on his watercolor method at the end of 2015. He currently has a book on oil painting that describes his sketching prior to painting method. I highly recommend this DVD.",1427155200,,638,4.508620689655173
