7823717,5,6302287723,"This video cassette contains the next two episodes of the series - ""Cygnus Alpha"" (episode 3) & ""Time Squad"" (episode 4). This is when the series really started to take off - Blake now has a ship, the Liberator, to fight back against the Federation with, and he gains the rest of his crew in these two episodes with ""Time Squad"" featuring Blake's first engagement with the Federation.

""Cygnus Alpha"" starts out slow, but it gets better as the episode goes along, featuring Blake attempting to rescue the rest of the prisoners from the penal colony on Cygnus Alpha and has him taking on a fanatical religious cult on the planet with its leader attempting to commandeer Blake's ship in order to wage a holy war against the galaxy. A little slow at times, but overall, not a bad episode. Four out of five stars.

""Time Squad"" is without a doubt the best episode in this set. With the prisoners free and now part of Blake's crew, Blake decides to launch his first assault on the Federation. Meeting the telepathic resistance fighter Cally, Blake convinces her to help them knock out a vital communications center on a Federation-controlled planet. While Blake, Avon, Cally, and Vila are on the surface of the planet, Jenna and Gan are busy themselves trying to prevent a takeover of the Liberator by mysterious aliens. Overall, a really good episode. Five out of five stars.

Highly Recommended!",1410998400,,1392,4.767634854771784
7823718,4,6302287723,"Episode 3: Cygnus Alpha - On their way to Cygnus Alpha, Blake, Jenna, and Avon learn more about their new ship.  It's faster than anything the Federation has and it has a teleport system (yes, like Star Trek).  The onboard computer is apparently named Zen, and it pulls ""Liberator"" from Jenna's mind as a name for the ship.  The prison planet is run by a religious cult led by Brian Blessed.  While Blake attempts to free the prisoners, Avon tries to convince Jenna to abandon Blake.

Episode 4: Time Squad - Blake head the Liberator towards Saurian Major, a central Federation communications point, in order to blow it up.  On the way, they answer a distress beacon, discovering a small ship with a crew in suspended animation, which they thaw out.  On Saurian Major they meet Cally, a telepath (she can send thoughts but not read minds, normally) from the planet Auron, who was the last survivor of a previous group of rebels attempting to do what Blake's team is doing.  And now they are seven (with Calli and Zen.)

Brian Blessed is his usual entertaining self in Episode 3.  Episode 4 really is slow paced.  It's odd; a lot happens in that episode, but it takes sooo long for it to happen.  Servelan and Travis...um, I think they're in the next volume.",1377388800,,1257,4.5874439461883405
7823719,5,6302287723,"The next volume of Blake 7 with two titles called ""Cygnus Alpha"" and ""Time Squad"".  Roj Blake former rebel leader now prisoner on his way to Cygnus Alpha was written off dead along with Jenna and Avon by the captain of the prisoner ship taking him and the others to the prison planet.  What the captain doesn't know is that Blake and the others are alive and figuring out the newly dubbed ship Liberator and what is offers to Blake in his quest to stop the federation.  Zen the ships computer is not what you would call forth coming with answers about who made Zen and why no one was on board still.  Avon thinks Zen is defective, Blake thinks Zen knows more then he is willing to let on.  Jenna just pushed a button that sent them flying thorugh the universe at break neck speed.  Blake realizing he needs a cerw heads for Cygnus Alpha knowing that those on the ship as he would want to get off that planet as quickly as they arrived.  Blake, Jenna and Avon all make discoveries on board the Liberator.  The most important is the teleport device with witch they can go down on the planet without landing.  Meanwhile Gan, Villa and the others land or should I say dropped on Cygnus Alpha where they find a clut has been formed by the prisoners sent before them.  They are controlled by a madman who (Played by veteran actor of such other great BBC shows and of other movies Brian Blessed) is called ""He who Must be obyed"".  Blake finds out that those on Cygnus Alpha are infected with some kind of illness and He who must be obeyed has the only cure. Blake has to find a way to get the cure get the others out and begin in earnest his mission.  What will Blake do?
In the next Episode entitled Time Squad
We see Blake and the others adjusting themselves to life  on the ship.  Blake has picked his first target it the federation planet Saurian Major holding a vital communcation network.  Also in hope to try and find rebel natives trying to stop the federation as well.  Along the way they find a small craft floating in space with a distress beacon asking for help.  Blake and the others bring the craft aboard.  Inside they find three men forzen.  Not knowing where they were going or where they are from they deforst them and try to help.  While waiting they arrive on Saurian Major.  Blake, Avon and Villa teleport down and try and make contact with the rebels.  Gan and Jenna stay on board but face challenges from the three from the craft.  Blake makes contact with but a lone rebel left after all the others are gone.  A woman not from the planet but from a planet called Auron a woman called Callie.  She helps Blake and the others destroy the network all the while Gan and Jenna are fighting to save the ship themselves and Blake when they need to get out.  All in all it was really the first four episodes that would set the stage for Blake and his seven. Those wishing to think of jumping ahead shouldn't because these were what laid the foundation for a rather long running show.",1026000000,,2992,4.355595667870036
7823720,4,6302287723,"The second volume of ""Blake's 7"" on video contains two more episodes of this beloved British sci-fi series. In ""Cygnus Alpha"" and ""Time Squad,"" the foundations of the B7 saga are still being established. This series tells the story of a band of rebels who wage a campaign against an oppressive interplanetary power known as the Federation.
""Cygnus Alpha"" opens with escaped prisoners Blake, Avon, and Jenna in possession of a mysterious alien spacecraft (given the name ""Liberator""). They stage a mission to rescue other prisoners from the Federation penal colony on Cygnus Alpha. There are some good suspenseful scenes, and the episode also contains an interesting depiction of a religious cult that has evolved on the planet. The B7 crew dynamics continue to evolve as the story unfolds.
In ""Time Squad,"" Blake masterminds a daring attack on a Federation facility. This episode introduces a new regular character: Cally, a telepath from the planet Auron. By the end of these two episodes, the original ""Blake's 7"" of the title (including the computer named Zen) are fully assembled, and ready to chart their bold course into sci-fi history.
Viewing these episodes (which set the stage for even better installments to come), I am struck at how much later space operas like ""Babylon 5"" and ""Farscape"" seem to echo some of the themes and narrative strategies of B7. Yes, B7's special effects and props may look a bit primitive today, but the show had a wit and intelligence that are still sharp. If you're a sci-fi fan who hasn't yet discovered ""Blake's 7,"" check out this and other videos in the series.",992131200,,1603,4.940740740740741

7823722,3,6302287723,"Although Blake's 7 is one of the best TV shows to have graced the small screen, one of its main problems is that it gets off to a dreadfully slow start - a fact which is made painfully clear by these two episodes. ""Cygnus Alpha"" is the better one, with the basic plot seeing Blake endeavouring to rescue the remaining prisoners to recruit as his crew. The prison world of Cygnus Alpha, with its established order of absolutist hereditary rule, is a none too subtle attack on organised religion, in particular the tenets of the Catholic church. Vargas is a well characterised tyrant of his own small domain, but Brian Blessed's performance is too over the top to do it proper justice. What probably makes this episode most interesting is the exploration of the Liberator, the introduction of Zen and, most importantly, the development of the relationship between Blake and Avon. The conflict between these two is an essential part of the series and would have far reaching effects - in this episode the foundations are laid. Blake's idealist, albeit naive, principles are laid up against Avon's cold, cynical and more realistic point of view. Avon is prepared to abandon Blake, not out of any sense of malice, but instead one of survival. Jenna's character is also given an interesting examination - her loyalty is tested - she is prepared to abandon Blake as well, but not after she allows him a chance to succeed. The character elements make up the best parts of this episode; other than that, it just serves to add Vila and Gan to the Liberator. ""Time Squad"" is nothing more than tedious filler. It crawls along; the alien probe presenting a totally uninteresting and cliched plot device. The episode serves to reveal more crew elements - we get to know more of Gan in some of the episode's better moments. His confiding his dependence on other people to Jenna is treated sympathetically, as is his revelation of his limiter implant. The other major purpose of this story is to introduce Cally - her first appearance is another of the episode's saving graces. She is interesting from the very beginning, as is the rapport she will develop with Avon, which germinates in this episode with the obvious respect she shows him. The attack on the Federation base, which Blake assures will be the first of many, is a fairly actionless one. The episode ends (finally) with the crew established. To the series' newcomers - congratulations on your perseverence! The long introduction is over - with the next tape the series finally starts moving!",974419200,,2538,4.810068649885584
7823723,3,6302287723,"""Cygnus Alpha"" is a bit hoky, with bizarre characters.  It is  essential viewing for fans of the series as it is a continuation of episode  2- ""Space Fall.""  The plot of ""Time Squad"" is similar  to ones used in a number of sci-fi shows.  It is interesting, but  predictable.  END",907718400,,279,4.44
