Like other reviewers, I am an avid fan of the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BBC-Time-Team/dp/B003Y73ZLW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BBC Time Team</a>&nbsp;programs, and own all of the Time Team DVDs. I started on Amazon US, with Region 1 format programs no longer available. Since then I order from Amazon UK (Amazon.co.uk -- hint hint) at a far better price, although in Region 2 format. While waiting for more BBC releases, I purchased this series. The shows are okay -- by way of comparison, I found this series at its best was about as good as the British version's more mundane episodes.

Bad video
------------
The video quality is horrible. The programs are recorded on the DVDs in 16:9 layout, but in a downgraded video format that uses about half of the screen area -- something close to 500290 pixel format. Not even slightly close to high quality DVD. It's un-watchable using regular DVD video quality, and just barely tolerable with up-sizing to 1024768 turned on in my blu-ray player.

Incomplete formula
------------------------
A great deal of the original BBC Time Team's appeal is the cheerful interplay between the show's ""big personalities"", and the cheeky presenter / producer Tony Robinson, who is (among other careers) a comedian. As a presenter, Robinson not only played the role of ""Joe Q. Public"" (or ""John B. Public"" in England?), he deliberately stirred up trouble.

The laid-back manner of ALL the American team members is their fatal mistake: both the presenters (Colin Campbell and Justine Shapiro) are far too laid-back and respectful. Consequently, the archeologists have no pressure to emerge from their calm, moderate, academic demeanor -- a poisonous excess of dignity. All very deadly for the show.

Part of the big success of the BBC series was where the intrusive camera operators exposing arguments between the series' regular archaeologists, none of which are shown in Time Team America, who always arrive on-scene as guests of the at-site excavators. Along those lines, Time Team America has a conspicuous lack of 'pub scenes' that were part of the BBC Time Teams' formula -- about every second or third episode -- where the British archeologists would sit around a glass of beer or wine and argue over their results, make bets, and generally let their hair down. Time Team America is all ""no fun"" archaeology.

I have never seen the early BBC Time Team programs, and I suspect that they also had a shaky couple of seasons before they found their groove. Unfortunately, Time Team America is a failed attempt to copy the BBC series -- the Yanks borrowed the Brits' name, logo, and even some of its personnel (check out the stalwart Ian Barclay piloting the excavator in the first couple episodes). But what they stupidly didn't copy was the breezy tone, cheerful rivalry, and ""bunch of [retired] hippies out digging in someone's garden"" part of the successful BBC formula. Those missing parts were crucial for the 20 year success of the BBC series.

The PBS producers can't be that stupid -- I think that they would have wised-up to their mistake with a couple more seasons. They were already experimenting in Season 2 by introducing a different presenter -- unfortunately the second season Justine Shapiro was just about as deferential to the academics as was graphic artist Colin Campbell. If they had another two seasons to eventually get around to hiring an irreverent, intelligent comedian as series presenter (think of actor Alan Alda's wit and grace lent to similar PBS science shows) it would have a good chance to have taken off.",1435104000,5,3743,5.11620294599018
8662385,2,B00KX45058,Not as well produced as the British series.  Maybe it takes time to develop the staff or maybe we're just too young of a country to have interesting historical sites.,1428883200,,166,4.533333333333333
8662386,3,B00KX45058,"The episodes that I've watched of the few that comprise both seasons were interesting and informative, but if you're expecting these to be as entertaining and finds as exciting as many of the original series, you will be disappointed. The United Kingdom is loaded with artifacts and treasures and every dig has the potential of revealing new information that could revise our understanding of a whole period. In the American digs it's more about a location that has a much more recent purpose and this finds add a little more insight to something already fairly well understood.",1414972800,2,578,4.969072164948454
8662387,5,B00KX45058,"This was the American version of the long running, though now defunct, British show ""Time Team.""  I did enjoy all the episodes.  They have been shown on PBS in past years.  They don't seem to have done more than the two seasons.  I really LOVE the UK version and wish BBC would put out more episodes in the US/Canada DVD formats.  If you like archaeology and history, you can't miss with this series.",1414800000,2,400,4.424657534246576
