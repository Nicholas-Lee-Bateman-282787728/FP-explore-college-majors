492713,4,6302658772,I love all of Ginger's movies.  The story line was good but not great.  I will watch it many times.,1366156800,,99,3.9
492714,5,6302658772,"What can I say, I adore Paul Douglas.  This is a fun film, always excepting the supremely annoying performance of Pat Crowley (I think time has proven she was not the next great thing). But MUCH to like here and as always tremendous chemistry between Douglas and whatever female star he was paired with, in this case Ginger Rogers. Their scenes together are wonderful. Light, funny and worth the viewing.",1293494400,2,404,4.771428571428571
492715,5,6302658772,"this movie is great, William Holden, the great actor that he is plays a wonderful part. I love watching him in any movie. I have most of his movies(collectable). highly recommend!",1203552000,,179,4.806451612903226
492716,4,6302658772,"It's William Holden night, here at Chez Sixpack...  Here, Holden stars as a brash, principled playwright who hitches his star to a famous-but-fading broadway star, played by Ginger Rogers.  Rogers's Beatrice Page is an interesting character -- she's at the top of her game, but only for as long as she can keep up appearances and fend off her younger rivals.  Among these is a chirpy, headstrong, would-be starlet (played by Pat Crowley) who attaches herself to Holden's coattails, at first out of mere opportunism, and then for true love.  The Holden character is a bit too mannered -- too anchored in the old, pre-'60s fixation with The Moody Writer as a great dramatic character; Crowley is herself a bit irritating as well -- this was supposed to be her big breakout role, but she's a bit too perky and Annette Funicello-ish, and may get on your nerves.  At the heart of this film, then, is Ginger Rogers, along with Paul Douglas as her ex-husband, a Broadway producer who's still not-so-secretly in love with her.  His career is in limbo because he can't move on, and he continues to pick plays based solely on whether they'll serve as vehicles for Bea's continued fame.  Their relationship is deeply layered and consistently interesting, as is the underlying theme of how female actors must keep up appearances and pursue an impossible ideal of youth.  Plus, Paul Douglas is such a great character actor -- I love watching him in just about anything! -- and seeing Rogers star in a relatively unsympathetic role is pretty unusual as well.  The portrayal of the vanity and backstage whispering that makes up the theater scene is territory that's been covered elsewhere, but it gets a pretty good airing here, in this well-paced, entertaining film.  Recommended.",1077408000,19,1766,4.895973154362416
492717,4,6302658772,"Bill Holden plays a young supermarket employee who writes a play about a young girl and her forceful mother; later it is produced by Paul Douglas for his ageing actress wife, Ginger Rogers. Lots of bright lines - with inside jokes for show people - coupled with snappy supporting performances by Patricia Crowley, James Gleason, George Reeves and, in an entertaining cameo, Marjorie Rambeau - playing herself - make for an entertaining 93 minutes. The then 42 year-old Rogers overacts a tad, but not enough to make the viewer wince. In an excellent portrayal, Patricia Crowley seems to play Eve to Ginger's Margo in this fast-paced and funny adaptation of Sir James Barrie's play ROSALIND. Modernised to 1953 standards and given several twists, it seems purposely reminiscent of ALL ABOUT EVE - in a harmless, light-hearted way.",1032912000,10,828,5.0510948905109485

492789,2,6302658772,"""Forever Female"" is set in a New York Broadway theatrical milieu ... much like ""All About Eve.""  Ginger Rogers is a big Broadway star who is continuing to play parts that are too young for her.  Paul Douglas is excellent as a producer who used to be married to Ginger and who's still in love with her.  William Holden does not look well and really has a lousy part for a guy of his talent.  Furthermore, he has to fall in love with new Paramount discovery (as touted at the END of the film) Pat Crowley, who is simply annoying as a supposedly free-spirited young actress who says things like ""He doesn't stand a Siamese chance.""  (Holden even asks her, ""What's with the Siamese bit?"")  A bunch of scenes are set in a mock-up of Sardi's, and the smarty-pants screenplay by the Epstein brothers has its fun with Broadway's lore and competitiveness.  This film was a revelation to me at a young age, but now it seems false.  Surely the title itself is a put-down of women everywhere, but in the context of the film I'm not even sure what it means.  The director is Irving Rapper, noted for his Bette Davis melodramas; he's a bit out of his element directing a brittle comedy.  Ginger Rogers looks great in a succession of Edith Head gowns and sports a very beautiful coat that photographs extremely well.  For New Yorkers, it appears that Ginger lives in a fabulous apartment in Tudor City ... or maybe it's Sutton Place.  At any rate, it has a view of the Con Ed plant that has since been torn down.  If you love Broadway or movies about actors, you'll want to take a look at this no matter what.",1432425600,,1594,4.399317406143345
492790,5,6302658772,"Broadway actress and a younger writer.  Ex-husband producer and a young, ""pushy"" hopeful actress.  Paul Douglas is a standout as the producer
and William Holden and Ginger Rogers are very, very good as the writer and actress.  Amusing with bright dialogue and situations.  Pat Crowley
is perky and an upbeat version of Audrey Hepburn.  A capable actress with good screen potential, Pat Crowley never achieved the expectations in
her film career.  The name should have been changed to something more glamorous and she should have been assigned better subsequent roles.
Still, her performance here is really quite good.  What m,ore could you ask for?  Great stars, a great story line and a great city!  Highly entertaining
and flies by much too quickly.  A good deal of fun for all!",1426204800,,780,4.976744186046512
492791,4,6302658772,Didn't expect too much from this movie since I never saw a Ginger Rogers movie before.  It was entertaining but I couldn't not stand that young actress that kept showing up and wanted the part. What a pushover.  Kind of disappointing finish.  Movie was OK,1425254400,,255,4.622222222222222

492837,5,6302658772,"Ginger Rogers is terrific in this very entertaining film. I don't think she was ever given the credit for her quality of fine work, outside of dancing with Fred Astair. D.V.D. arrived on time, and in excellent condition.",1411344000,,220,4.815789473684211

492840,4,6302658772,"1954 Film stars Ginger Rogers and William Holden with a nice supporting role by Paul Douglas.
Interesting that Ginger Rogers was in her early forties at the time of this film and played an actress in her early forties who was still playing roles for a 29 year old.
This is a comedy mixed with some drama about aging in Hollywood. I thought it was 'brave' of Ginger Rogers to take on a role like this at a time where she could have still pulled off playing slightly younger roles.
I like Ginger Rogers but wasn't sure what to expect.
Turns out it was an entertaining film and well worth the time spent watching it.",1402444800,2,613,4.339130434782609
492841,3,6302658772,"A neat old film, but not Ginger Rogers best work.  Worth watching..... has some humor and a good ending.  Enjoy...",1396569600,,114,4.65
492842,4,6302658772,"I normally I don't like movies like this (about theater and plays) but this was pretty good. Without describing movie details, which was not all that great in my opinion, (not my type of movie), I thought the humor was very good. I like that type of humor and the acting was good, with maybe the exception of Pat Crowley who in my opinion was too intense, (although extremely cute), in her role (turn off the high beams there). Paul Douglas was exceptional I think, very good at that dry sense of humor.",1388016000,,503,4.419354838709677
492843,5,6302658772,"You must like a movie pretty much when you're willing to get a VHS copy of it along with the
VHS player to watch it.  I watched ""Forever Female"" first on Amazon and then just had to have it.  The acting in it is just marvelous by everyone concerned.  Paul Douglas and Ginger Rogers play off of each other so well.  William Holden has no trouble holding his own against both of these well-established actors and is such a fine looking man at this age (about 35) which puts him in the prime of his career.  This film was made the same year he made his Academy Award performance in ""Stalag 17"". Compare Holden in ""Forever Female"" to the Bill Holden of 1969's ""The Wild Bunch"" or 1976's ""Network"" and while that face shows the wear and tear of his life it is no less appealing and in some way even more so as he ages.  It's wonderful that so many of these older Holden films were preserved and available at Amazon and through Amazon Prime.",1381881600,3,935,4.284090909090909
492844,2,6302658772,Ok movie but superficial.  William holden is EXCELLANT...too young for Ginger Rogers.  One of his obligations to studio I assume.,1379721600,2,129,5.4
492845,5,6302658772,"A very thought prevoking film. Why is it that to be the wrong side of forty for a women means having to lie about your age to keep getting the parts, as Ginger Roger's character has to do to maintain good roles in this movie. Still a beautiful woman, mature yes, but still able to hold her own amongst the best of them. I wonder if the male population had to go through the same it would change the view of getting older as being acceptable in the cinema and theatre. I hope attitudes have changed since this movie was made in the early 1950's, I think it has, thank goodness for that.",1371254400,2,585,4.185840707964601

7829010,4,6302658772,"Think of it as ALL ABOUT EVE lite -- an aging actress (Ginger Rogers) is obviously threatened by a pushy newcomer (Pat Crowley) while the actress' amiable ex-husband (Paul Douglas) and the playwright attracted to the noob (William Holden) don't quite know what to make of it all.  No classic, but has its moments.  Some say that the backgrounds at Sardi's and backstage convey the B'way essence better than the hyperliterate EVE did.

William Holden is always the same.  Just the same, it was a good movie.  I enjoyed the story and the ending was the way it should be in a hollywood movie.

7829018,1,6302658772,"The only thing that makes this film sort of watchable (sort of) is William Holden and Paul Douglas (along with the occasional witticisms provided by the gifted writing team of Julius and Philip Epstein). Even the estimable Ginger Rogers is trying too hard. The concept and the script are too preposterous and the self-conscious performance of Pat Crowley, making her feature film debut, doesn't help. Maybe Audrey Hepburn could've made things more palatable, or Shirley MacLaine. Maybe.",1443657600,,486,5.324675324675325
