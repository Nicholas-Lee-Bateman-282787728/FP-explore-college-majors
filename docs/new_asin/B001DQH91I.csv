3537150,5,B001DQH91I,"This product was purchased to get World Without End as an upgrade from my previous VHS copy.  I was not disappointed.  The quality of the sound and video is great.  I don't think I ever saw the movie in widescreen before and it makes a huge difference.  It's a great fun sci fi movie and I watch it at least once every six months.
I don't recall having seen Satelite in the Sky before.  It is a British sci fi movie about space.  I did not like it as much as World Without End but it did have an interesting looking space ship.

3537151,4,B001DQH91I,I remember seeing this years ago. It's an apocalyptic story that's upbeat (very unusual for today). I really liked it.,1355702400,,118,4.95
3537152,3,B001DQH91I,"in look & feel - WORLD WITHOUT END resembles a STAR TREK (original series) episode - astronauts encounter a repressed society with scantily clad women in need of red-blooded rescuers - and a deformed murder - amid cheap claustrophobic sets - long receding hallways painted on the back wall - sliding doors - etc - etc

but this was made 10 years earlier

the movie's plot is a dumbed down version of THE TIME TRAVELER by HG Wells - this isn't a bad thing - but - after STAR TREKs many variations - its overused - however this film has the virtue of being only 80 minutes - so i had little sense of suffering

a young Rod Taylor plays one of the astronauts - he played his role with an accent - tho a more refined one than typical aussie - it's as if this was his audition for a film he would star in about 4 years later - THE TIME TRAVELER - ironically

***

i quickly gave up on the second film - SATELLITE IN THE SKY - i watched the first 20 minutes - and it failed to make me care about the fate of the experimental jet or it's crew - or even that Canadian born Lois Maxwell - the future Miss Moneypenny - had a leading role",1348358400,6,1127,4.0358744394618835
3537153,5,B001DQH91I,"Because it has Rod Taylor in it. He was making this movie when he was approached to make The Time Machine. I had to see the movie for that reason alone.

The movie is so bad as far as special effects go. For the year that it was made, they were probably pretty state of the art, but wow, so bad. The acting was pretty much over the top and normal for that era of movie making. The plot, however, was pretty darn good. It could be made into a movie even now and hold up pretty well without any changes.

If you are a fan of Rod Taylor's or any of the other actors in this film, it's worth watching. Really. It's pretty good.",1348272000,2,623,3.976
3537154,4,B001DQH91I,"Like the other 2 recent WB 2-fers which were exclusive at Best Buy, this one is getting a ""wide"" release in October.  Avoide the leeches/gougers.

Here is the wide release:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/World-Without-End-Satellite-in-the-Sky/dp/B001EZE5KG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">World Without End/Satellite in the Sky</a>",1220659200,,365,8.333333333333334
3537155,5,B001DQH91I,"Warner Home Video sneaked out this superb DVD as only available exclusively to BestBuy stores in the U.S., who don't ship items outside the U.S. Luckily for myself and many others in the UK, amazon market place sellers in the U.S. know when they're on to a good thing and bought up a lot of copies of this DVD from BestBuy and I was able to obtain mine from a seller in New York.

I was aged nine and three quarters when I went to the cinema on Monday, January 7th, 1957, to see WORLD WITHOUT END. It was an ""A"" certificate film (children not allowed in to see it unless accompanied by an adult), so I asked a man to take me in and I was totally enthalled by it. In fact, nothing at that time captured my boyhood imagination like WORLD WITHOUT END.

The premise of the film is excellent (I won't go into the plotline, as Prof D has already done that in his review) and the acting, music and photography are also salutory. Although the special effects seemed marvellous when I first went to see it, they do seem pretty ropey now, but the rest of the film more than makes up for this. If the plot seems a little familiar, it bears more than a passing resemblance to H.G. Wells The Time Machine, which itself was made into a successful film four years later in 1960 and, oddly enough, it also starred Rod Taylor, playing a similar role to that which he played in WORLD WITHOUT END...that of a time traveller.

I have had the pan and scan VHS video of the film for many years, but this wonderful DVD release, with it's superb picture and sound quality, has given me the opportunity to see the film in it's original CinemaScope wide screen ratio for the first time in nearly fifty-two years and I am delighted with it. The Technicolor is also very beautiful. If only modern films looked as good as this.

As for SATELLITE IN THE SKY, I never went to see that and my viewing of it on this disc marks the first time I've seen it. The transfer is equally as good as WORLD WITHOUT END and the film is more than adequate, but, of course, it doesn't hold the same importance for me as WORLD WITHOUT END, which was so much a part of my childhood of long, long ago.

The DVD has only the two films on it. There are no scene selections and no extras of any kind, not even a trailer for either film. Perhaps, with this release selling so well, Warners with give it a proper release with scene selections and extras. Although most of the cast and crew of WORLD WITHOUT END are no longer with us (after all, it was filmed in 1955 and released in 1956), Rod Taylor is, as far as I know, still around. So maybe they could ask him to do a commentary on the film. Anyway, I wholly recommend this DVD and give it five stars!

3537156,5,B001DQH91I,"I FINALLY found the 1956 Sci-Fi classic, ""World Without End"" on dvd through Amazon.com's ""other dealers"".  Why it was never released and shown on Amazon's ""New Releases"" list is beyond me.  However, the dvd version is GREAT...it's in Cinemascope and the master from which it was created is perfect...and terrific-looking on widescreen tvs!  Apparently Warner Brothers had the rights to this Allied Artist production and released this movie with another -- ""Satellite in the Sky"".  I haven't watched the other movie yet; who cares anyway?  To get a ""virgin"" copy of ""World Without End"" in its original format and without flaws in the master copy is INCREDIBLE!!!

For those of you who are not aware of this classic, ""World Without End"" follows the exploits of four space explorers (among which are Hugh Marlowe, Rod Taylor and Christopher Dark) in 1957 as they traverse an ""exponential time displacement"" while orbiting Mars and wind up in the year 2508.  The earth has be devastated by an atomic war (in the year 2188) and these four explorers have to cope with everything from giant spiders to mutant humans and evil people as well.  It's good escapist fun for the whole family and, though the special effects are limited, entertains throughout.",1219795200,28,1246,4.9855072463768115

I mean., I loved that film but others here who didn't see it as kids and only recently saw it, they don't rate it as highly as I do even today. So, poor World Without End  comes along and I was excited to see it but can't belive I'm writing this --  both of these are pretty bad movies if you didn't become acquainted as kids. Of the two, ""Satellite in the Sky"" is the best with very decent special effects. But they are both soooo talky.",1458345600,,574,4.209090909090909

3537176,3,B001DQH91I,"When you watch a sci fi film made more than  a half century ago and it seems just plain silly, you have to wonder if our films today will look as ludicrous a half century from now. I suspect they will.

World Without End was part of a sci fi explosion in films that took place in the 1950s, many of them focused on Mars   Flight to Mars (1951), When Worlds Collide (1951), Red Planet Mars (1952),  Invader from Mars (1953), Devil Girl from Mars (1954), The Angry Red Planet (1959), etc./Even Abbott and Costello Go to Mars (1953). World Without End mixes the sci fi element with time travel, also a popular topic at the time  Terror from the Year 5000 (1958), The Atomic Man (1955), Ill Never Forget You (1951), and of course, The Time Machine (1960).

The film stars Hugh Marlowe, Rod Taylor, and Nelson Leigh.

Hugh Marlowe (1911-1982) was a mature and stable presence in dozens of films, notably Twelve OClock High (1949), All About Eve (1950), and The Earth Stood Still (1951).

Australia born Rod Taylor (1930-2015) played macho roles for more than 50 years. Hes best known for his work in The Time Machine (1960), The Birds (1963), and The V.I.P.s (1963). He was very active on TV in series like Falcon Crest and Walker Texas Ranger.

Nelson Leigh (1905-1985) appeared as a co-star in dozens of films and on TV, especially in the 50s and 60s.

The film is written and directed by Edward Bernds (1905-2000) who is best known for his work in sci-fi (Queen of Outer Space, Return of the Fly, Space Master) and with the Three Stooges in the 60s.

Its an unremarkable film, notable as the first sci fi in Cinemascope. The color photography is excellent and the outdoor sets go beyond sound stages.

For my tastes, the best sci fi films of this era are The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), Red Planet Mars (1952), The War of the Worlds (1953), Forbidden Planet (1956), Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957), and The Fly (1958)",1433030400,,1964,4.545454545454546
3537177,4,B001DQH91I,"If you were born between 1940 and 1950 you most likely saw most of these science fiction movies and if you were like me you loved them. They are old school and far out dated. That is why younger folks would all most never watch these movies. I was about 8 years old when I first saw them and did I ever love them just liked I  loved my go kart and I still love them both. I'm not that old, but I still love my go kart and 50s science fiction movies. By the way the picture and sound is very good.",1432339200,2,496,3.8155339805825244

3537192,4,B001DQH91I,"Both movies are from the 50's and are Standard 50's SiFi movies.  Satellite in the Sky is British made and World Without End is pure Hollywood.  I bought ""World"" because Rod Taylor was in it and is a good actor.  He among a group of scientists who are returning from a mission in space and end up being sent into Earth future. There the helpless beautiful women, a standard of any 50's movie and corny looking  ""mutates"", who mumble, grunt and stumble around. It's not a bad movie and Rod Taylor would star in the Time Machine a few years later, where he does the same thing, save helpless beautiful women and fights hairy mutants called morlocks.  ""Satellite"" is not as good and very British and involves space travel and a big bomb. There are two things that make this movie watchable.  Lois Maxwell, the Future ""Miss Moneypenny"" of 007 fame plays a female reporter who make it aboard the spaceship and Kieron Moore, who got into a big fight with Sean Connery in Darby O'Gill and the Little people.  It was that fight that got Sean Connery noticed by the wife of Mr. Broccoli and he ended up as James Bond.  The airplane seen at the beginning of the movie is British Vulcan bomber and it is the plane that is stolen in Thunderball.  World is a better movie, but they come in a two pack so you might as well watch it.",1407974400,2,1318,4.368852459016393

3537196,4,B001DQH91I,Loved this movie as a kid.  Purchased to watch with my kids who also liked it despite there exposure to much more sophisticated graphics.  It's an improbable story but fun.,1365379200,,172,4.7
3537197,4,B001DQH91I,"This is a double feature that doesnt really pair well together.  The first, World Without End, is a typical futuristic end of the world time travel scenario.  After a simple photo-mapping mission of Mars, something goes horribly wrong.  As the crew of the spaceship heads for home, theres a KABOOM, and their spaceship careens out of control.  They crash and realize soon enough (no half buried Statue of Liberty), that theyve arrived home....just a little late for dinner.  In quick order, they run afoul of two spiders as big as dogs and three cavemen.  Thank goodness, they thought to pack revolvers!
I really enjoyed this first offering, it has a familiar plot but they don't belabor it.  It also has a bit of intrigue, a few scantily dressed women, and Rod Taylor in an early role.  I felt this movie was worth putting in my collection for future viewings but not so the second feature, Satellite in the Sky.  (Unfortunately, since they're both on the same disk, you cant have one without the other.  Although I do plan on ignoring its presence there.)  The title of this movie is definitely misleading, as is the tagline: the never told story of life on the roof of the Earth!  The plot involves sending a rocket into space without telling half of the crew that its carrying a bomb that needs to be ""tested"" in space.  Getting to that point though, takes some doing as the story is immediately swamped with a lot of unnecessary characters and subplots.  Theres also extensive footage of a plane in flight that has absolutely nothing to do with the story at hand.  But they had to pad the plot because it literally has nowhere to go once they get in space and need to send the bomb off for detonation.  They force a little drama at that point but its too little too late.  Even the shot of the BIG explosion is disappointing, just a glimpse of a dark cloud in space.  Its an easily forgettable film.

I give 4 stars to the first movie and only 2 stars to the second.",1361664000,6,1971,4.501408450704226
