I have recently purchased the Hoods whole 14 video set and am a very satisfied customer.  Ron and Karen just won 2 awards for outstanding videography and that says a lot about the quality of their productions. The information in this 2 video set is just a small portion of the whole series they produce.
I highly recommend this video to anyone who is looking for great information in a short format.

Mrs. Hood is anoying,I don`t need anybody to tell me constantly
how deeeeliiiicious is the things that she is eating,Mr. Hood is
ok. Ohhh... and you never put such a big rock below a figure 4 be-
cause the log for the dead fall can and will be stoped by it,like
it happens in the video. The rest is so-so. I will not buy other video from Mr.and Mrs. Hood.",1000252800,,476,4.184782608695652
7886623,5,630523521X,"Ron Hood has created an entire series of survival videos and I have collected almost everyone.  He does a great job in everyone, including this one of not only telling you what needs to be done, but also SHOWS you how to do it.  I have been studying wilderness survival for many years and he corrected many errors I've made in a few minutes of video.  Books can tell you how to make cordage and even include pictures, but Ron Hood actually shows the process.  Seeing the entire process with all the skills creates a better learning environment than reading about it and seeing one or two drawings or pictures.  Ron also has a vast background of knowledge and experience that shows in the video.  He was in the military and taught survival classes at the collegiate level, now he operates a survival school and has a website dedicated to wilderness survival.  So you are also learning from an expert who 'lives' wilderness survival.  I highly recommend this tape and all of his tapes.  His series is now up to number 10.",971827200,6,1019,4.554945054945055
