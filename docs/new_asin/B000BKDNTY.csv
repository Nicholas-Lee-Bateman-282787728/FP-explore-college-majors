2697271,2,B000BKDNTY,Unfortunately this program does not hold my interest.  The production is mediocre.  The interviews are ho-hum and the cars featured are given short shrift.  I love classic cars but Jay Leno on YouTube is much superior to this program.,1453507200,,234,4.948717948717949

2697298,4,B000BKDNTY,"We originally started watching this series because our three year old LOVES cars, and we thought that it would be something new that he might enjoy, and he really truly did enjoy it.  It is a very fun and educational program in many ways, and if you've got a little car fiend in the house - or if you're one yourself - it is definitely worth giving it a try.  The only negative aspect of it is that well, it is an older program and the video quality is not anywhere near the HD standard that we're so used to today.  At the end of the day though, that's a very minor thing, as it more than entertained the audience we meant to be entertained.  :D",1436832000,,646,4.103174603174603

2697332,5,B000BKDNTY,Great show! Fun to watch and you really see true car guys with cool cars and interesting information. It is so much better than the genre of car shows that inject arguing employees and fake timelines into the program.,1415836800,,217,4.589743589743589

2697359,5,B000BKDNTY,I am a car nut so I like this show tremendously. It is well balanced in the information it provides in sharing different types and ages of automobiles. The segment with those behind the design and production is very interesting and great history. I grew up in a time where for 35 years I knew all the American and British produced makes and models and when the designs became boring and so much of the same thing no matter who made them I lost interest. So I love what are now considered the classics that come from the ages when automobiles were more important to the culture in a way that defined style as most important.,1411430400,,623,4.379310344827586

2697390,4,B000BKDNTY,"I watch My Classic Car on Amazon often. But I especially enjoy the Leno episodes. And, surprisingly I really like the sponsors segment.  I'm sure the Mustache has a wealth of knowledge on his own but he always seems to be in awe of Leno.  It's funny to watch him buzz around like a rookie on the first day of training camp.",1397952000,,323,4.193548387096774
