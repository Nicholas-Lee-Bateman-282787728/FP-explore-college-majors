3673692,5,B001KW74BA,"You can't blame people who try to make a buck during an advantage of a lifetime.  In this small rural Uruguayan town, the Pope is planning a visit and the locales devise a plan to make use of that time.

Filmed in 2007, the action takes place in 1988 when Pope John Paul II makes a  visit to Melo, Uruguay.  There is footage of Pope John Paul II visiting the town, as this is based on a true visit.

The main character, Beto, is a grocery smuggler, and poor.  He is married to Carmen with a teenage daughter who has visions of becoming somebody, namely to become a TV reporter.

With the anticipation of the papal visit, the impoverished townspeople have imaginations that thousands of people will pass through the town.  The numbers are exaggerated from thousands to as much as 50,000.  Therefore, they hatch plans to sell what they can, laboring at huge quantities of foods, then spread out on tables awaiting the thousands of passersby.

But Beto has another plan, knowing thousands will be in town, it figures that thousands may need to use the toilet.  So he builds one, without plumbing, but a fancy door.

This is a fun, light, humorous movie, with professional and amateurs alike.  The storyline moves quickly and one just can't wait to see how the great plan evolves.

Film Movement released this little gem.  Film Movement brings film from around the world, great writing, great directing, great movies.......See it!  Rizzo.",1349913600,4,1434,4.721774193548387
3673693,5,B001KW74BA,"After reading some of the not so good reviews (and the several glowing reviews) I was impelled to respond. ""The Pope's Toilet"" is a very poignant story with a subtle religious message based on a real event. I have read and seen much about religion, but this film presented the idea more effectively than most. It also helped me understand the grinding and relentless poverty, and petty corruption, that perhaps defines many third world countries. It is hard to understand how viewers living in this country could say it was a boring, so-so film. I would recommend it to every mature and discerning viewer. . .",1325894400,18,609,4.754716981132075
3673694,4,B001KW74BA,"This movie is touching, poignant, and heartfelt, while still being realistic and interesting.  It's an empathetic portrayal of some poor families in small-town Uraguay, who are human and close-knit, and have aspirations to better their lives through capitalistic endeavor after learning that the Pope would visit their town to give a speech.  Of course, they learn in the end that capitalistic investment has risks!

It's title originally threw me off, as it didn't sound like something I wanted to watch.  But once I started watching it, the pathos of the main character is very touching, as he strives to build a fancy pay toilet and capitalize on the predicted thousands of Brazilian visitors to the Pope's speech.  He really wants to build a better life for his family, rather than continuing the pathetic scrapping out a living being a bicycle smuggler.  The movie builds real tension as he works with all his might against time and the forces pushing against him, because you don't know whether he will succeed or tragically fail.  (For the ending, watch it for yourself and see!)

I really liked the insight into the characters and relationships in this small slice of the South American world.  Of course, it's just a movie, but if it rings true, then many wealthier persons in the developed world would envy the close friendships and sense of community that is displayed here.",1313366400,7,1385,4.935344827586207

3673696,4,B001KW74BA,It certainly is a budget film but well played and directed.  Awesome insight into life in Uruguay.  The story itself is so so.  I recommend renting it but not buying it.,1295568000,,169,4.387096774193548
3673697,5,B001KW74BA,"A poignant film about the poverty-ridden residents of Melo, Uruguay, who spend what little they have to capitalize on the thousands of tourists they believe will swarm Melo to see Pope John Paul II. Beto is the film's principal character. He makes his living bicycling into Brazil to smuggle goods back to Melo shopkeepers. Beto hatches the most grandiose money-making scheme of all -- to build an indoor toilet for the anticipated crowds. Using his wife's pin money for their daughter's education, Beto builds his toilet. The crowds never arrive, and the residents of Melo are left poorer than before. The film is based on Pope John Paul II's 1988 visit to Melo in which only three hundred visitors arrived out of the predicted thousands.",1292544000,,739,4.92
3673698,5,B001KW74BA,"One of the most touching movies I ever seen.
Those that know the area of the globe (small frontier towns between Uruguay and Brazil) can appreciate the realism of this movie depicting the people, social life, struggles, and geography; for those that do not know the area, this movie is an enjoyable learning experience.
Only these excellent actors could bring this excellent story (base on actual events) to the screen with such level of realism and entertainment value.",1288310400,2,470,5.038461538461538
3673699,5,B001KW74BA,"A town in northern Uruguay, 60km from the Brazilian border, is excited about the impeding papal visit.  Residents discuss ahead of time how to prepare their town for such an honor.  The local TV station hypes up the visit, interviews its people and we learn that many of the residents had taken out loans to beautify their homes and town for the visit and to sell goods for visitors from Brazil.

It's a touching enough story.  The plot evolves around one poor family of husband Beto, a smalltown smuggler riding an old one-speed into Brazil for goods he can sell at a profit in town.  He thinks himself above his simple-thinking wife.  He, afterall, uses his ""thinking cap"" and shemes up ways to make a living. But if only he had paid attention to her idea of profiting from the papal visit!

Apparently a lot of other bicyle-riding smugglers do this for a living, as the disinterested border guards let most through without stopping (unless they are black).  The Brazilians don't care much for these poor Uruguayans who keep cycling across the border, and the Uruguayans seem quite content with their lives.

All around you is poverty.  Stray dogs stroll around town looking for handouts.  Old men sit in front of their homes chatting with neighbors.  The flat, green fields around Melo are the backdrop of this movie, and all the neighbors seem to get along in their communal poverty.  It really doesn't look like a town the Pope would or should visit.

Carmen, Beto's loyal wife, despairs of her husband's grandiose ideas but supports him anyway. Their daughter  Silvia (who has dreams of being a radio announcer one day), somehow is the most beautiful creature in this movie seems to be accepting of her fate yet sees the family savings go to waste for the papal visit.

Beto makes a lot of smuggling attempts just to make enough money to buy the supplies he needs for his toilet.  He even trains his wife and daughter in how to approach tourists and sell them the use of the toilet.  Some of the scenes are quite heartbreaking, because even though there's no doubt that Beto loves his wife and daughter, he also has a violent, drunken side to him.  And for him, there would be nothing better than buying a motorbike from the profits of that toilet.

But why would the Pope come to such a down-trodden town that doesn't even have plumbing?  The townsmen don't see it that way.  To them the Pope is coming because he loves them.  The media hype up the visit; up to 300,000 people could be coming to Melo and this is going to make a lot of poor people in town much, much richer!

Here is where the movie becomes a hidden message of blind religious faith and political manipulation.  In the end the papal visit doesn't quite turn out as planned.  The Pope (actual footage of his real visit to Melo in 1988) gives his short speech in Spanish and then goes back to his Popemobile and drives on.

""Is it over?"" asks Carmen as she watches the Pope via a town's small black and white TV.  The TV commentator continues to smile and smalltalk about the grandiose visit.

This movie was tenderly portrayed.  The actors seemed so real in their characters.  The town always played a role in this movie, either up close with its cracked facades, or as a dirty village in a riverplain.  In the end the viewer wants to step inside the town and give everyone a hug for everything they did for the papal visit.

I enjoyed this movie.  I predicted the end accurately but there is more to this story.  It's about faith, family bonds, neighborly devotion and dreams, as well as the manipulation the Catholic Church uses on its followers.",1278201600,7,3621,4.569875776397516

3673704,4,B001KW74BA,"I recently was browsing the foreign movie section of my local library and stumbled upon this particular DVD. I didn't pay much attention to it, other than it was released by Film Movement, which has an amazing library of indie and foreign films, and so I went ahead and picked it up.

The Popes Toilet (2007 release from Uruguay; 97 min.) brings the story of Beto and his family and friend in the Melo community in Uruguay, not far  from the border from Brazil. As the movie opens, we see Beto and several others biking back into Uruguay, heavily loaded with packages of all kinds. Its not long before we understand that Beto and his friends make a living smuggling everyday goods from southern Brazil into Melo. Meanwhile, Melo is getting excited about the upcoming visit of Pope John Paul II, and Beto and many others are thinking of a way to take advantage of this unexpected economic opportunity. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, youll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, it wasn't until I  was about to start watching this that I noticed this movie originally came out in 2007, so almost 10 years ago. It is amazing then to notice that the movie has a certain timelessness about it, as I found this movie utterly fresh and mesmerizing. I was at first a little put off by the movies opening disclaimer that the events portrayed in the movie are in essence true and its only by chance they didn't occur the way they're told here, whatever that is supposed to mean. But the Pope did in fact visit Melo (in May, 1988). Second, the movies director pays close attention to the economic struggles of the Melo community, synthesized here by Beto and his wife and daughter. His wife has accepted her fate, while his daughter has big dreams of becoming a radio announcer and going to study in Uruguays far-away capital Montevideo. In that sense, this is a rather depressing movie, as life is hard for this remote community. Its all the more exciting then when the preparations for the Popes visit begin, and people in Melo are wondering/contemplating how many Brazilians will cross the border for this historic moment (and spend money in the Melo community): 2,000? 20,000? 200,000?

Per the usual, the Film Movement DVD comes with a bonus shortie, this time the excellent Video 3000 (5 min.) from Germany, an animated shortie about a person who has just received his new DVD player, and is trying to figure out the remote control. Just watch! Meanwhile, The Popes Toilet is an excellent example of Film Movements rich library of foreign and indie movies. The Popes Toilet is HIGHLY RECOMMEDED!",1456617600,2,2666,4.67590618336887

8316296,5,B001KW74BA,"Melo, Uruguay is a small town about 58 kilometers from Acegu and the international border with Brasil.

On May 8, 1988, Pope John Paul II visited Melo, an event for which the locals hoped and planned to have tens of thousands of visitors, whom they also hoped would spend a lot of money on food and on souvenirs.

As it turned out only about 8,000 people came, and most of them were from the village of Melo itself.

This story, based on that event, is a bitter sweet demonstration of the lengths to which the poor people of Melo went in hopes that the visit would help relieve their poverty.

The results were far less than spectacular.

Nevertheless, the film is spectacular. The acting is superb. The family relationships and friendships in this wonderful story all shine, and the film ends on a note of hope, despite the bitter disappointments experienced by the community.

This is a wonderful film.",1511913600,,904,4.654088050314465
