3521542,5,B001D0TV4W,"This is my favorite episode of Charmed, and for $1.99, it's worth buying. This ran a bit slow on my computer and occasionally the dialog fell behind the picture, but you still get the overall story.",1374192000,,198,4.527777777777778

3521544,1,B001D0TV4W,This DVD is misleading it is actually the final season. I had season seven and final season I got this thinking I would complete my set. Now I have to go through the pain in the butt of sending it back.,1369094400,3,202,3.951219512195122

3521550,3,B001D0TV4W,"This season suffers terribly with the introduction of the character of Billie.  If they wanted a spin-off they should have introduced the character and made her likeable and sympathetic instead of antagonistic to the Halliwell sisters.  The introduction of Coop was better as he's a likeable and believable romantic interest.  Having Leo leave halfway through the season left a real gap of humor, warmth, and romance.  The overall story arc of the season revolving around Billie trying to reunite with Christy got old really quickly.

I loved Charmed and was sorry to see it go but I didn't love this season.  I'm grateful they got a chance to wrap up all of the storylines gracefully and left the characters in a good place instead of leaving us on a cliffhanger.",1430179200,3,764,4.838461538461538

3521555,5,B001D0TV4W,"Despite thinking it was the dumbest thing ever when I first started watching it (seriously defeating demons with simple rhymes? Acting like it was so hard to create these ""spells"" and always a huge delayed reaction). But I've come to love it. Watched seasons one through seven on Netflix for free and paid for this season through Amazon (must really love it to pay!)",1418428800,3,366,4.734375
