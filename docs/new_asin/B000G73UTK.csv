8129257,5,B000G73UTK,"Neil Hamburger is simply amazing and so is this dvd. Any fan of Neil will not be disappointed. It has all of his best jokes and plenty of other good ones. This dvd has some amazing special features, some good documentaries and more stand up. Many people don't like Neil, but for those who do this dvd is definitely worth the money.",1205280000,2,331,4.354838709677419
8129258,5,B000G73UTK,"Neil Hamburger is the best thing to come along since Andy Kaufman. He really knows how to work a crowd like an ocean. It really comes in waves, he takes you to depths you weren't thinking were possible and then renews himself with a real Zinger. This Guy is all Class. He can also be seen on Tom Green's website doing poolside chats.",1174435200,7,333,4.301587301587301
8129259,5,B000G73UTK,"He's very handsome on the tv! The effects are breathtaking! The dialouge snaps crackles and pops! (""Wait till they get a load of me!"") And the secret bonus video game makes the Playstation look like the GAYstation!",1172448000,13,214,4.8108108108108105
8129260,5,B000G73UTK,"Buy this disc if you want to laugh so hard that your lower intestine rips loose and you crash through the glass table onto your face and lie amongst the cracker crumbs on the rug ... drooling.

Someone said humor is tragedy plus time, but Hamburger is tragedy plus phlegm (and always heroically funny)

Please come to Richmond, VA. Neil, we need more maccaccas.

and rerelease the Zip Code Rapist stuff.",1159401600,7,403,4.647887323943662
8129261,5,B000G73UTK,"Neil Hamburger is a genius.  Pure and simple.  His task is to become the worst stand-up comedian in the world.. and he fails horribly.  This guy's awesome, and this DVD will be the best 20 bucks you have ever spent in your life.  Think Andrew Dice Clay mixed with Bob Saget mixed with Tony Clifton.",1157587200,4,298,4.363636363636363
