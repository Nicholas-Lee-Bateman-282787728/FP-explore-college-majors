8298035,5,B001EGQBYI,"This Holy Communion DVD presents the viewer with the Real Presence of Jesus in the Eucharist. Is not that the most important thing that children, who are about to make their First Communion, should understand and believe? The story is the framework, and is secondary, to the message that is conveyed, and it is done very well. EWTN is right on target with this video, and it should be shown to children from the earliest of ages. I am buying this DVD, which I watched on EWTN, for my granddaughter, who will soon be making her First Communion. I wish I had seen it earlier.",1363392000,3,573,4.466666666666667
8298036,1,B001EGQBYI,"I was looking for something visual to play for my 2nd Grade Catechism Class that might spark some excitement about making their First Communion.  I chose this DVD in part because EWTN had their name on it and I know that their programing is very good and in line with the Catholic Church's teaching.  I am very glad that I watched this DVD before showing it to my class as it was the biggest disappointment for me. For me, the title and the story had nothing to do with each other. I have no idea how the writer made the connection.  What is equally disturbing is that I can not return it so my money has been wasted.  I will definately never buy another DVD for children again.  The order was delivered very timely which was the only good thing about my experience.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/First-Communion-DVD/dp/B001EGQBYI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">First Communion - DVD</a>",1314489600,7,922,5.1610738255033555
