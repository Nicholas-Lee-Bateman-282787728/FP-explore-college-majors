1877282,5,B000093FHX,"After years of owning the first....five Penguins movies, I was just about ready to finish off the collection. However, when I went to do my research, I was disappointed to find not only one, but five more penguins videos. It took me a bit to realize that yes, Tell-a-Lie was the last Penguins movie that Big Idea ever did for home use. The ones afterward were for some Saturday morning cartoon or something, and all the voices were replaced.

In any case, this particular 'finale' to the original Penguins series is hilarious! Just as wacky as the first five, and a special 'appearance' at the end by everybody's favorite blue-haired old lady.

Definitely worth the buy.",1313107200,2,670,4.767241379310345
1877283,5,B000093FHX,I bought this for my child. I want him to enjoy nice things from the bible. This was just what the doctor ordered. Even I as an adult can enjoy 3-2-1 penguins films.,1311552000,,165,4.03030303030303
1877284,5,B000093FHX,This brings to light one of many learning and development areas that children AND adults should learn.  I enjoyed it as well as my daughter.  Collect the whole series!,1184112000,,167,4.724137931034483
1877285,5,B000093FHX,"My son loves the Penguins! Personally, my favorite is ""Kevin."" Just like the Veggie Tales series, these movies are God's lessons on a child's platform. Even if you aren't religious, they teach pure moral values and aren't preachy at all. The animation and humor is that so that even I don't mind watching them over, and over, and over again like he does. Moon menace is a great tool for teaching about not lying, and how great you feel when the truth is told. The doom funnel rescue features helping others, and the featurette ""music video"" follows the same lesson and is hilarious to boot! These both are a must buy!!",1087862400,,618,4.576576576576577
1877286,5,B000093FHX,These are hilarious DVD's that teach God's lessons to boot!  My son loves watching all the penguin videos so we are glad to add these to our collection.

7988853,5,B000093FHX,"3-2-1- Penguins stories are great for kids because they each have a lesson to learn and they are lots of fun to watch!  We had the videos when my sons were little, and they are teenagers now and requested the DVDs to watch again!",1389312000,,229,4.204545454545454
7988854,5,B000093FHX,My kids love these movies and I enjoy them because they have Bible verses that the kids recite. It's easy for them to understand the concepts and morals/values from the Bible.,1377388800,,175,4.67741935483871
7988855,5,B000093FHX,"Although we haven't seen EVERY Veggie Tales story, we do love them...and although my daughter hasn't seen EVERY animal on the planet, she LOVES penguins...  How appropriate!!  We saw a preview for 3-2-1 Penguins on a V.T. show and of course she wanted to see it...just because it's penguins >:D  Well...this was the first show she saw and she LOVED it!!  She's almost seven and is getting a LOT out of the show because she's a little older and can catch more...understand more...although, it's definitely set up to be easily accessible for younger viewers, as well...  As a 40-something viewer, I must admit this show is HILARIOUS!!  Granted, it's in the nature of V.T. to cater to all ages...and they still do it brilliantly...  It was nice to see the original creator's names in the credits, too...  We've since purchased/watched the Amazing Carnival of Complaining which is also HILARIOUS!!

The most important points:  It has Christian values right there in the stories...with the voice of reason first coming from Grandmum and Jason and Michelle then learning it for themselves...and how beautiful that each story ends with bedtime prayers :)  Amen!",1373932800,,1154,5.021052631578947
7988856,5,B000093FHX,"I used this in a SS class of small children. We don't usually show videos but all the teachers were busy.
The kids stayed focused throughout. (I would recommend this as a prerequisite before taking government office.)
I thought the length was 60 min. It is actually 30 min. Something that is not apparent from the description. 30 min worked out perfectly for us.",1362700800,,362,4.671875

I love all of the 3-2-1 Penguins Movies. I started out with the Direct-To-Videos (including this one) and even the T.V. edition that I have seen recently.

This is the last episode of the original 3-2-1 Penguins Movies. These originals were longer, had a song, and featured only one twin to go to each mission instead of both. Another is that these had the older (and better) voices (Mark Marten, Greg Mills, Ron Smith, ect.)

This episode follows Jason T. Conrad as he finds his Granddad's old Dart-board. After he directly does not listen to his Grandmother and tries to make a bull-eye, the dart-board falls down and it breaks. (Hmm...I am sure that a certian young asparagus did something similar...)
He gets Michelle to lie for him and they agree that it just fell. Then, The Penguins take Jason to the Planet Tell-A-Lie, where a group of dart aliens on a planet (that...looks like a dart-board) might get completely smashed by their moon. But with all of the citizens lying...finding the king, and the truth, may be harder than Zidgel, Midgel, Fidgel, Kevin, or Jason would be able to immagine.

The story was great, of course. The penguins coem in rather late in the story, but not as late as in ""Planet Wait-Your-Turn."" Like ""Larry-Boy & The Fib From Outer Space,"" they use a metaphor to explain lying. (In Fib, the lie GREW along with the alein...and in this one, they will have to feel the wieght of the world on their shoulders)

Ammusing as it is, Zidgel is the only one on the crew that lies. In all, he probably lied more than any of the aliens of ""Tell-A-Lie"" together. He even fibbed quite a bit after they figured everything out.

The gags in this movie were brilliant like always, but I felt that BigIdea should have had some cameo of the Fib on Planet Tell-A-Lie (hey, they are in space...and it is about lying) but no matter...

And most surprising of all, you actually get to see Grandmum's face at the end.

All in all, a great movie and obviously worth a check-out!",1360108800,,2007,4.58659217877095
7988858,5,B000093FHX,"Bought as a gift for my future daughter-in-law, who is a penquin lover from way back & loves funny animation.  Found this & if I had enough money, I would have bought all of them.  So I had to control myself.  Looking forward to seeing her open this.  It arrived on time & looks to be in good shape, hope it is when she goes to play it.  Good price.",1340582400,,349,3.9285714285714284

Would have returned it, but needed it for the gift I gave today. Pretty embarrassing when I gave it and saw that it had been previously opened and the prints on the disc!
