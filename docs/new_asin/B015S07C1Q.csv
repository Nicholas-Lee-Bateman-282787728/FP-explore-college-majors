8734395,5,B015S07C1Q,"This is my 4th Happy Yoga with Sarah Starr/Chair Yoga DVD.

What I love about Happy Yoga with Sarah Starr/Chair Yoga DVDs:  I have osteoporosis and arthritis and it is a gentle way to do yoga exercise. Using a chair also helps with balance. Doing yoga (as well as other exercises) help with building strength in my bones. I am beginning to do some yoga stretches without a chair, but I love my chair yoga. I want to live a long and healthy life and Happy Yoga with Sarah Starr is part of my routine! I'm just a huge fan of Happy Yoga because it gives you the option of gentle chair yoga and doing yoga without a chair (which is more challenging for me). I hope to one day be able to do more yoga without a chair.

The locations and sounds of nature is a perfect combination and relaxing.  So much better than a studio.

If you have never tried yoga or even if yoga is part of your routine - give Happy Yoga with Sarah Star a try.  Your body will thank you in a healthy way.",1468713600,9,973,4.094736842105263

It was an episode from Volume 1 - in the sunflower garden - and was so beautiful and relaxing I ran to Amazon to see if it were available on DVD.  I'm so glad it was!  I'm new to yoga, and wanted something that wasn't labeled for ""Seniors"" that gave me some support so I could learn poses and breathing without falling on my nose.  Happy Yoga's Chair Yoga is just perfect for me!  I love having the variety of one seated and one chair-supported episode in each of the five volumes - good value for the money!  Sarah Starr's voice is clear and calming, and the settings are amazing.  The filming is very well done.  I've ordered three so far, and plan to complete my set with the other two volumes soon!",1464912000,8,793,4.275167785234899
