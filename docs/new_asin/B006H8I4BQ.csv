This superb 75-minute historic feature-length documentary on Soviet Ukraine's 1932-33 Holodomor (forced famine) which was engineered by Stalin's regime to unleash national repression in Ukraine in addition to unleashing Communist terror, is entitled, Genocide Revealed (""Okradena Zemlya"" is the Ukrainian version of Genocide Revealed).

It is produced, directed and edited by Yurij Luhovy, a Ukrainian-Canadian, award-winning Montreal producer/director, filmmaker, and accomplished film editor, who has worked in the private industry for over 35 years. He is a member of the Academy of Canadian Cinema. Yurij has worked in features with Paul Almond, MGM and many co-productions: French, Italian and Yugoslavian.

As an award-winning filmmaker, he has worked on documentaries for CBC and the National Film Board of Canada and many independent productions. Other films that Luhovy has produced, directed and edited include:  ""Bereza Kartuzka,"" ""The Tree That Remembers,"" and ""Freedom Had a Price.""

Mr. Luhovy has received the Presidential Order of Ukraine for his accomplishments.

Yurij Luhovy has also co-directed the award-winning documentary film, ""Harvest of Despair.""  Since the release of ""Harvest of Despair,"" more information has been revealed.  Never before seen material (Soviet archival documents, rare film footage and photos of the period) is exposed.  Yurij Luhovy's objective in making this film was to bring this horrendous chapter of Ukraine's tragic history to mainstream audiences.

Genocide Revealed is under the patronage of the World Congress of Ukrainians and was funded in part by La Caisse Populaire Desjardins Ukrainienne de Montral, Ukrainian Canadian Foundation of Taras Shevchenko, and the Ukrainian Genocide Foundation Chicago.

This documentary is based not only on commentaries by historians, declassified Soviet archival documents, and rare historical footage, but also, most importantly, on the testimonies of survivors from various regions of Ukraine (Petrykivka, Dnipropetrovsk Region; Odesa Region; Khalcha, Kyiv Region; Mala Vovcha, Kharkiv Region, and more).

Utilized were the following Film Archives:  Central State Cinephotophono Archives, Kyiv; Nina Topishko; Larysa Malkova; and the National Archives, USA.

Photographic Archives included:  Central State Cinephotophono Archives, Kyiv; Volodymyr Serhijchuk, Kyiv; Roman Koval, Kyiv; Vinnenberg Collection, Austria; James Kominowski, Dafoe Library, U of Manitoba; and, Hoover Institution Archives.

""The photographs used were very carefully scrutinized to be period specific.""  This was done specifically because Holodomor deniers say that photos that were used in the past were from Ukraine's other famines.

Genocide Revealed is narrated by Academy Award winner Graham Greene, who is best known for his nomination as Kicking Bird in ""Dances With Wolves.""

Voiceovers are by Jill Hennessy (known for her award-winning work as a star of ""Crossing Jordan"" and ""Law and Order""; also, she composed a song dedicated to her Ukrainian maternal grandmother) and Lubomir Mykytiuk (a Ukrainian Canadian with numerous film and television credits).

It is dubbed, but in such a way that you can hear the Ukrainian original.

Proceeds from DVD sales help offset the cost of making the documentaries.

Five stars plus for an award-winning, powerful, persuasive historical documentary film by an award-winning producer, director, and film editor.  A professional production in every sense of the word, this DVD not only merits viewing, but should be in personal and public libraries and Holodomor should be a part of all school curriculums.

The word Holodomor, in Ukrainian, means murder by starvation.

Some notes regarding Holodomor: E News Channels wrote recently informing readers that Holodomor, which took place between 1932-33 during Stalin's brutal reign against the Ukrainian populace, was genocide by famine--murder by starvation. Its aim was to bring about Sovietization of the Ukrainian people and forced collectivization of Ukraine's farms.

The Communist Regime confiscated grain produced by Ukrainian farmers, withheld other foodstuffs, punished those who attempted to flee, and executed anyone trying to obtain food. Thus, in the land called the Breadbasket of Europe, up to ten million men, women, and children were starved to death. Over 20% of the Ukrainian population died as a result of the famine; at least three million were children. At the height of the man-made famine, 25,000 Ukrainian villagers were dying per day, or 17 per minute.

An excellent reference source on the Holodomor (in addition to Genocide Revealed) is a DVD by award-winning Ukrainian-American Film Director Slavko Nowytski and award-winning Ukrainian-Canadian award-winning Montreal producer/director, filmmaker, and accomplished film editor, Yurij Luhovy, `Harvest of Despair: The Unknown Holocaust.' Slavko Nowytski and Yurij Luhovy have both been awarded numerous international film prizes; moreover, any undertaking bearing their names is guaranteed to be a professional production. This DVD is sold by Amazon.com (USA), or may be obtained through interlibrary loan.  Please read my Amazon review for further information.

Recommended in `Enough' (please see my review of this excellent book by Marsha Forchuk Skrypuch) are several sources to learn more about the Ukrainian Holodomor: The Harvest of Sorrow by Robert Conquest (available on Amazon.com [USA]), Oxford University Press, 1987, ISBN 0195051807; Harvest of Despair, a 55-minute black and white film, ISBN 1-57299-377-4; and, on the Internet: `Black Famine in Ukraine 1932-33: A Struggle for Existence' by Andrew Gregorovich.

Addendum: In spite of the efforts of some to deny the Ukrainian Holodomor, Kyiv Post, in its November 17, 2008 issue, reported: ""Representatives of around 40 countries will come to Ukraine to participate in events dedicated to the memory of the 75th Anniversary of the Holodomor Famine in 1932-1933,"" including: the Presidents of Macedonia, Estonia, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, and also Bosnia and Herzegovina; Parliamentary Delegations from Moldova, France, Argentina, Brazil, Hungary, Spain, Croatia, Finland, and Liechtenstein; and, a Delegation from UNESCO, the European parliament, the OSCE, and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.

On January 22, 2010, Glenn Beck (Fox News Channel) carried a ten-minute segment on the Holodomor. So, slowly the public is becoming informed about this horrific chapter of Ukraine's history.
