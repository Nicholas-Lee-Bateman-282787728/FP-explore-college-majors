7719389,5,B01DLHR2MM,This was an eye-opening riveting thriller that holds surprising twists and turns around every corner.

7719396,1,B01DLHR2MM,"Blair Witch knock off, cameras have come a long way...but really! I find it amazing that with all the technology we have no better footage of an entity?, that is suppose to be nothing more than a killing machine that evaded being captured on film at every turn.
