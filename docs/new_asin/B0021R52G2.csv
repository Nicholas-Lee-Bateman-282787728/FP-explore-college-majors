8349416,2,B0021R52G2,"Where does anyone get off to charging such an outrageous price for making a lamp shade(s).  OMG...this is so simply people!  And really, how much to make a DVD?  Gosh, don't fall for this gullible ad.  I have one just like the picture and it was no where near what this person is asking for.  But if you want to pay that much for it, I will be glad to give you my address and the instructions on how to make this lovely lamp shade practically free of charge.  Don't fall for this gimmick.  This is a scam, BIG TIME!",1374796800,7,515,4.09
