Recently released by Gorgon Video is a two-fer of classic exploitation films from the great Arthur Marks, who I was familiar with through such classic films as Detroit 9000, Bucktown, J.D.'s Revenge and Friday Foster. I wasn't sure what to expect since those films were more blaxploitation/urban than the two titles on this set, but I knew Marks was a good film maker and had to give them a shot. The films in question are 1973's The Roommates and 1975's A Woman for All Men.

The Roommates is a classic story of a group of twenty-something girls who decide to go away together for the summer to Lake Arrowhead. Among the girls are sassy Carla (Sugar Hill herself Marki Bey), wild Beth (Big Birdcage's Roberta Collins), strong Heather (Petticoat Junction's Pat Woodell) and motherly Brea (The Hot Box's Laurie Rose). We follow these beautiful girls as they party and meet up with different men and each have their own adventures. Oh yeah, and just to make this film not your average seventies swingin' girl film, there is someone going around killing people at the lake too.

A Woman for All Men stars Judith Brown (also from The Big Birdcage) as Karen, a Las Vegas prostitute who marries a rich older businessman (Keenan Wynn), much to the dismay of his children. One of his sons (played by Dirty Harry's Andrew Robinson) however falls for Karen and after his father disappears and is presumed dead, they run off only to realize things aren't really what they seem.

Gorgon Video hits it out of the park with this sleazy duo of exploitation goodness. Arthur Marks proves himself a great film maker in any genre and with great stories, a who's who of classic 70s actors and lots of skin, what we have is a must buy DVD/Blu Ray combo. The Roommates, with its lovable cast of some of the sexiest girls in film at the time, witty script and proto-slasher side plot was definitely the stronger of the two. A Woman for All Men was a nice lurid tale with the beautiful Brown and menacing Robinson holding it all together but suffered slightly by its almost Soap Opera moments. Gorgon's presentation here is top notch with amazing looking transfers and a bunch of worthy bonus features (including on screen interviews with Marks, Brown and Roberta Collins).",1449532800,2,2368,4.685096153846154
8693854,5,B00R2J5VNI,"Gorgon Video hit it out of the park with this classic drive-in double feature.  THE ROOMMATES is a definite favorite that finally sees its first ever home video release here, and the finished product exceeded my expectations.  This starts off as a light, breezy cheesecake romp with four female college students (plus a visiting cousin) finishing up the semester then heading off to Lake Arrowhead for the summer.  Each girl is given her own story line (much like the Roger Corman nurse/teacher flicks from the era), and all are woven together as their summer adventures are underway.  About 40 minutes in, the film veers into a killing spree whodunit, with someone picking off gorgeous women at the lake.  Despite the underlying danger, the girls continue enjoying their fun in the sun and pursuing their romantic interests, leading up to a wild, climactic shootout at a country club gathering.  Great (if somewhat dated) dialogue, gorgeous 70s girls, funky fashions and some really off the wall red herrings make this an enjoyable watch.  Gorgon did a fantastic job with the restoration using the original camera negative; it's certainly a far cry from the damaged, scratchy, faded print I saw at the Alamo Drafthouse several years ago.  The co-feature is A WOMAN FOR ALL MEN, a fun, sleazy drama with an old millionaire returning from Las Vegas with his new, much younger wife.  His children and housekeeper are not thrilled at all, and everything spirals into blackmail, infidelity and murder.  Both features are definitely products of their time, and anyone who is into free-wheeling 1970s drive-in flicks will enjoy this Blu-Ray/DVD package.",1444521600,2,1647,5.089219330855019
8693855,1,B00R2J5VNI,"I bought this to see Ginny Golden, whom I once used on an episode of ""Emergency!"". She coldn't act then, but was extremely attractive. She still couldn't act in this film, and had taken on a hard quality that I found very disappointing. Perhaps Ginny was just a faulty/wistful memory.",1439942400,,284,4.7
8693856,3,B00R2J5VNI,"While both THE ROOMMATES and A WOMAN FOR ALL MEN both look great visually in Blu-ray, both films are rather forgettable and don't merit repeat viewings. Its as though director Arthur Marks was specifically TRYING to make a movie where the drive-in crowd that was going to see it wasn't really there to see the movie; a  kind of background noise for other goings-on in the various back seats of teenage-driven jalopys. Marks made sure to give the other, unlucky half of the crowd what they WERENT getting; namely, female nudity and sex scenes, with some off-color language thrown in to amp up the naughty factor.

I was between four and six years old when these movies were released and I can say they pretty much capture the way people looked and dressed back then, so the nostalgia factor may be of interest to some. The problem is it takes about 45 minutes before the plot really kicks in on either feature, and the scripts are pretty clich-ridden before we even get to that point.

Brightly-lit, crudely shot, THE ROOMMATES comes across as a demented mix of an R-rated BRADY BUNCH episode crossed with PSYCHO. And even that is overselling it and sounds more interesting than it actually is. Surrounded by tempting nubile, female flesh, a Greg Brady-wannabe utters the line Sometimes I wish my mother had dressed me funny so I could have grown up to be a homosexual. All thats missing is a laugh-track, yet the film takes a jarring and abrupt turn at the halfway point and tries to turn itself (unsuccessfully) into a proto-Slasher/whodunit.

That being said, there is plenty of eye candy here with pre-silicone female pulchritude on display. Pat Woodell (the original Bobbie-Jo on PETTICOAT JUNCTION) appears and displays a knockout figure in a midriff-baring top and skin-tight bellbottom hip-huggers (the dated fashions are another minor selling point for the film).

THE ROOOMATES fares better than A WOMAN FOR ALL MEN, which is much duller despite a more interesting and darker premise. Judith Brown is a decent choice for the role of the gold-digging former hooker as she looks just used and mature enough to be believable, yet still attractive enough to snag a millionaire like Keenan Wynns character. Actually, with her long eyelashes, perky breasts and ever-present cigarette, Brown looks exactly like the cheap floozies found on those illustrated covers of many a cheap dimestore pulp novel of the 60s and early 70s. (Shockingly, a quick IMDB search reveals that at the time Ms. Brown was filming this and showing off her bodacious attributes, she concurrently appeared on the PBS kids staple MISTER ROGERS NEIGHBORHOOD! The DVD extras show that she still looks incredibly good for her age).

Still, WOMAN is a rather dull affair and you're apt to find more excitement and suspense in your average episode of KOJAK, BARETTA or STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO than you are here. The incongruous harmonica score doesnt help either, which sounds like this thing should be taking place in the Arizona desert or an old ghost town rather than a posh L.A. beach house.

Can kill a rainy afternoon and surely beats crappy reality TV but no replay value here, sadly.",1434844800,5,3162,4.888059701492537
8693857,5,B00R2J5VNI,"Seemed to have taken forever for a company to release Arthur Marks' THE ROOMMATES on home video (even blu ray!!). We fans of this little seen film from 1973 have been waiting after years of reading blogs and begging Dark Sky/MPI to release this ""lost"" film and finally in 2015 our wish is granted! This is drive-in exploitation filmmaking up there with the Women in Prison films from Roger Corman's group. THE ROOMMATES is not your typical ""everyone should see this"" film from a long gone era of low budget filmmaking aimed at drive-in movie theaters for a quick buck. They do not make these type of cheesy, real people acting (people that seem to be natural) movies anymore. The movie itself doesn't know if it wants to be a drama, thriller or horror film with the characters getting bumped (no pun intended) off. It is fascinating to see how great this movie looks in 1080p! And the biggest treat is we get a second film from the drive-in king (sorry Roger Corman fans) himself Arthur Marks called A WOMAN FOR ALL MEN (which I still have not seen) but I bought this edition fro ROOMMATES alone because this (along with THE FARMER) have been on my video wish list for years!",1433721600,2,1175,4.547169811320755

8693859,5,B00R2J5VNI,"Gorgon Video really did a GREAT job on the transfer of the Roommates (haven't watched the other film yet) but the picture quality of the Roommates is pristine! Crystal clear (minus some grain/dirt and scratches in a few of the stock shots). The sound is good also. I assume that if you are reading this you are already a fan of this almost forgotten Gem of 70s Drive in cinema!

For those that are unfamiliar, this film is a light and fluffy buxom girls on vacation 70s romp. It's full of sun, bikinis and some light skin along with some surprises at the end even if they are quite corny by today's standards. This was a time when films didn't always have to take themselves seriously to be fun and the Roommates is the epitome of this era!

I myself am a HUGE fan of all of the main ladies but three in particular! Roberta Collins (from the Big Dollhouse/Women in Cages), Christina Hart (The Stewardesses) and my personal favorite the Beautiful Laurie Rose!!!! It's great to see these women looking young and in their prime again all on blu ray!",1427846400,14,1046,4.471204188481676
