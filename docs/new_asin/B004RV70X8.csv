4461752,5,B004RV70X8,Amazing adventure into a land that still remains relatively untouched by humans - extraordinary sound quality as well as cinematography.  These guys make it look easy - it's not!,1357084800,,178,5.137931034482759
4461753,4,B004RV70X8,"First, there are two discs in the blu-ray version. One blu-ray, the other a traditional dvd and both include all three episodes.

This was a very well researched, photographed and produced documentary of the three different bear species in North America. It was refreshing to listen to a very engaged and well spoken Chris Morgan instead of the usual dry, lifeless, monotone of a disconnected F. Murray Abraham that Nature has unwittingly assigned to the vast majority of their programs in recent years. That's a major bonus, as you always come to expect top-notch footage from these highly dedicated cinematographers. Time for producer Fred Kaufman to get a clue in that regard.

The first episode on coastal brown bears was clearly the best of the three, as they obviously spent more time working in close proximity with these animals in the wild than the others.

The first half of the second episode spent too much time on urban black bears in Anchorage rather than in the wild, which I believe is what most of us prefer to watch when we purchase natural history dvd's. The rest covers interior grizzlies mostly from Denali National Park. Could have done without the tour bus footage in Denali.

The last episode covers polar bears and grizzlies in and around the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Again a little too much humanity diminishes the quality of the natural history but, I understand the point they are trying to make.

All three episodes show some of the great landscapes and other wildlife species as it pertained to the vast and spectacular Alaskan wilderness they worked in.",1355356800,6,1592,4.903345724907063
4461754,5,B004RV70X8,Bear fights galore and just all around cool footage of bears. The two discs contain a lot of material!,1344384000,,102,4.421052631578948
4461755,5,B004RV70X8,Got the dvd quickly and this is a WONDERFUL dvd! If you love bears this is the program for you.  Order the book along with it and you have a great set.,1329350400,,151,3.71875
4461756,5,B004RV70X8,One of the best documentary films I've seen. Great story; informative and mixed with some humor to keep it from becoming to dry.,1316476800,5,128,4.608695652173913
4461757,5,B004RV70X8,"I enjoyed the BBC series Planet Earth. This is not the same type of documentary. But don't let that scare you off.

You are taken on an amazing trip across Alaska. I like how Chris Morgan is on camera and part of the series. He makes this a personal journey and you can really see the intuition he has gained over the years.

This is very family friendly and for everyone out there.",1316304000,,382,4.219178082191781
4461758,5,B004RV70X8,Beautiful documentary on bears. I have been to Katmai National Park in Alaska where some of this is filmed. And it is the next best thing to being there.,1311984000,8,153,4.310344827586207
4461759,5,B004RV70X8,"After seeing the series on PBS I had to buy the blu ray. This is a wonderful transfer and the best documentary ever on the bears of Alaska. Buy this, you will not be dissapointed.",1309996800,9,179,4.142857142857143

8439362,5,B004RV70X8,Just an excellent video!,1434067200,,24,5.25
8439363,5,B004RV70X8,"I loved how in HD you can literally see the fur flying when the massive bears are battling for the mate.  There is no way I would get within 10 feet of a sow and cubs as this guy does in the first episode.  It's also kind of corny in that it leads you to think you could take a road from the Alaska Peninsula and arrive in Anchorage.  My favorite is the 2nd episode.  I've lived in Anchorage nearly my whole live - and I love it here.  I like how the ride through downtown is weaved in with the radio soundovers.  The scenery is nothing less than breathtaking, but then that's life in paradise.  Jessie Coltrane is inspirational for any young woman that might think of becoming a wildlife biologist.  Some of it's kind of romanticized, but that's how it's produced for TV, and I'm okay with that.  I enjoyed it.",1398988800,,811,4.248366013071895

8439365,5,B004RV70X8,Bought this for our granddaughter and ended up watching it multiple times along with her this last month.  The narration by the individual that filmed much of the action made it especially educational.,1392854400,,201,5.090909090909091
8439366,5,B004RV70X8,This was a great movie on bears. I even learned many things regarding bears. I'm sure anyone would enjoy this DVD movie.

8439367,5,B004RV70X8,"Part 1 City Of Bears:

Chris Morgan a bear ecologist goes to the Alaskan Wilderness to observe the giant Grizzly Bears. Chris has by his side filmmaker Joe Ponticorvo, as they embark on a 3,000 mile journey to uncover, and discover, and to peel back the myths and misunderstandings surrounding Grizzly Bears, Polar Bears, and Black Bears of the last Frontier. The story begins on an isolated stretch of the Alaskan peninsula thats unspoiled by mankind. Their purpose was to follow the bears for an entire season.

What I liked about this educational documentary was that in all 3 series, Chris Morgan remained responsible, and professional. He never took any unnecessary risks, as a precaution he kept a can of bear spray at his side. He does not play-up to the camera by showing off, thereby endangering himself and the bears. The pictures of the bears is very clear, the music comes and goes but is very calm.

Part 2 The Road North:

Chris travels on his motorcycle to Anchorage Alaska to observe Black Bears coming into the urban areas where people live, and make pests of themselves. They focus on the removal of Black Bears, and Moose by experienced wildlife conservationists. They travel to Denali National Park where motorcycles aren't allowed so Chris is forced to use a cargo van to continue his journey. The bears in Denali are more spread out, which makes tracking the bears more difficult.

Part 3 Arctic Wanderers:

We now enter the home of the Polar Bears on Barter Island.  The bears were watching and waiting, for the sea to freeze over so they could go and hunt seals.  A Polar Bear starts walking in the film crews direction, so Chris and Joe jumped into their boat for safety and pulled away from shore. Unlike Grizzlies, and Black Bears, Polar Bears are the most predatory of all bears. From there Chris teams up with a guide named Dale, and each man carries a shotgun to protect themselves against the unpredictable Polar Bears out on the frozen sea tundra.

From there they study the effects of global warming on Polar Bears, and the melting of the ice. They then board a small airplane in search of the Arctic Grizzly by looking at the caribou trails left on the ground from the air. They catch up with the Arctic Grizzly, and get a report of a salmon run, with the hope of watching Grizzlies catching salmon. Once again Chris carries his shotgun as a precaution from Grizzlies, because they have a much more aggressive behavior than coastal brown bears.

They observed a Grizzly Bear family fishing for salmon; they filmed this while keeping a safe distance away from the bears. When the mother bear came too close to them, they took her clue and left the area on a good note. From there they took the small airplane away from Alaskas wilderness.",1364083200,3,2771,4.683127572016461
8439368,5,B004RV70X8,"When you see narrator Chris Morgan sitting still and murmuring calming words to the large male grizzly mock-charging him during filming in Alaska, you want to know more about both him and the bears whose lives he documents.  His back-story can be found in the hardcover book describing the making of the DVD, ""Bears of the Last Frontier:  the Adventure of a Lifetime among Alaska's Black, Grizzly, and Polar Bears"".  Chris just appeared in his home town of Bellingham, WA to show ""...never-before-seen...hilarious...moving...epic footage from....Siberia, Peru, the Arctic, Alaska, Borneo... on February 17th and if I could have afforded the airfare from Maine,  I would traveled the 3000 miles trip to hear him, he's that good at what he does.  Start with the ""Bears of the Last Frontier"" -- that's how I learned about him.  I had known that he was a long-time supporter of the Vital Ground Foundation, and had done several PSA announcements for them (Public Service Announcements), but nothing beats seeing him in action, photographed by the equally intrepid Joseph Pontecorvo.",1362096000,,1078,5.166666666666667
