8592034,3,B00DCUTR86,"Drivelish denouement, but the setup is fascinating.  Little Mary, who just lost her mom in Salt Lake City, leaves to live with her doting uncle, who's on the trail of gold in northern California.  What she doesn't know is that her uncle has been killed by Indians, and a fleeing stagecoach robber has assumed his identity.  Her initial treatment is shockingly brusque.  This is the best part of the film.  Later on uplift and redemption take over, and the story collapses.  But Mary and the fellow playing the robber, Elliot Dexter, do a creditable job.  Nice clean print.",1454284800,2,572,4.775510204081633

8592037,1,B00DCUTR86,"I'm a huge Mary Pickford fan, and am very familiar with the relative lower quality of 100 year old silent films, but this is the worst boot-leg copy (of a copy, of a copy, etc.) I've ever seen.  Do NOT waste your money on this.  I'm actually surprised that Amazon allows this to be a product on their site.",1366675200,,306,4.169491525423729
8592038,1,B00DCUTR86,"Don't waste your money on this one. I guarantee that you will not waste your time after seeing a minute or so of the film. The video reproduction looks like it has been transferred through a vaseline covered lens, ie. a hardly discernible picture. And the extra insult is that there is no audio.",1365552000,,295,4.481481481481482
