8605477,3,B00EI3XOK8,"If, like me, you want to see the great Henry Armstrong along with Canada Lee in his first movie, it looks like the Alpha DVD is our only choice. Just be aware that the sound track is so full of static as to be nearly unintelligible at times, and that the video is not much better.",1448841600,,280,4.017857142857143
8605478,5,B00EI3XOK8,I wanted the movie because I had the original movie poster Keep on Punching. The vintage movie was great featuring the legendary boxer Henry Armstrong.,1436572800,,151,5.08
8605479,3,B00EI3XOK8,"I normally don't list comments about Amazon purchases, but I thought in this case I would.

I bought several Alpha discs lately (Harlem features and Lights Out episodes), and about half of them were actually DVD-R's. This title is one of them. Unfortunately, it was not listed on Amazon this way.

I assume that Alpha is now ""duplicating"" some of their past titles rather than going through the cost of ""replication."" Yet sadly, even some of their packages that contain DVD-R's show the traditional DVD logo.

As for the material itself, it is what you would expect from Alpha (and even has their watermark during beginning and end credits), but I love these offerings from bygone days so much, I chose to acquire this vintage item. The disc plays okay, but of course, as a DVD-R, it won't play in some machines.

(By the way, note for the record that the following Alpha titles I purchased were actual pressed, replicated DVD's: Lights Out, Vol. 6; The Girl from Chicago; Spirit of Youth/Lucky Ghost; Where's My Man To-Nite?/Mystery in Swing; Miracle in Harlem/Ten Minutes to Live; The Bronze Buckaroo/Midnight Shadow.)

Just thought you should be fully informed",1417737600,,1163,4.913265306122449
8605480,5,B00EI3XOK8,"I originally ran across this movie on TCM some years ago and was surprised to find how much I enjoyed it.  I found Herb Jeffrey to be an interesting actor with a lot of charisma and although the plot may seem antiquated by today's standards, if you stick with it I think you'll find it a surprisingly entertaining movie.",1402099200,,320,4.423728813559322
