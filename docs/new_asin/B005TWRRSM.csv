8486575,5,B005TWRRSM,"In the so-called ""civil war"" (it was really a very un-civil war), Sherman and others waged war on the Southern civilian population (old men, women, and children). This DVD gives a glimpse of the brutality of the war against the civilians. I highly recommend it. As has been said, the victors always write the history, and it was no different with Lincoln's war. Thankfully, though, there are now many historians that are examining original records and letting us know what really happened.",1420588800,,489,4.975609756097561
