7945578,5,B00005MKKR,"Some German( from immigrant families or immigrants themselves) soldiers did not fight for Hitlers 3rdReich, but against it. Perhaps some of us in North-America are aware of it, but there was never much information here, about Germans that fought in the Soviet Army, to fight against fascism. This movie tells an autobiographical story of one of those soldiers, that just reached the age of 19, when he crossed the border with his Red Army comrades, to help to put an end to Hitlers regime. A very puzzled young men, he witnesses carnage and tragedy. Growing up in the Soviet Union, he meets
the ""other Germans"" for the first time, asking soldiers to surrender, and civilians to cooperate with the new Soviet authorities. Those interactions you are gonna witness are priceless, you haven't seen anything like that in other movies.
One of the Concentration Camps his army is about to liberate,
comes not only as a shock to him, but also as an important lesson. It's not a combat war movie, this movie does has a few combat scenes, but the focus is on the human tragedy, and how our protagonist deals with it. The scenes are sometimes gut-wrenching, and I caught myself sometimes being moved to tears. Interesting also, how he releases himself from the experience, with his self dialogues. I can not see any other actor but Jackie Schwartz pulling off the act of this soldier. He's still a big star in Germany today, doing mostly TV movies and series.
I would have loved it, seeing him in some Hollywood movies, like his compatriot Armin Mueller Stahl. They are truly great actors.",1363219200,2,1578,4.783882783882784
7945579,4,B00005MKKR,"Watching the film for the first time, I found the handling of the ""German Boy Turned Soviet Soldier Comes Home"" story line interesting, but I thought someone in his boots would have been treated far more harshly (even if protected by the Soviets).  Still, good watch.

After checking out the features, understanding that this is an East German film, produced when The Wall was still well in place, the handling of the story made more sense.

Well worth being included in any WW2 film collection.",1331683200,2,495,4.8
7945580,5,B00005MKKR,"This fine film is based loosely on a combination of history (various rewritings it) and actual notes the actual writer/director made in his diary as a young soldier in The Red Army during the last months of WWII. As such, there is almost no plot or story, just a string of incidents going in one general direction. The cinematography is great, the acting fabulous all around, production values excellent, and the soundtrack is clear, with subtitles. It is an interesting, gripping, and at times exotic adventure in film. See it.",1302220800,,528,4.877777777777778
7945581,5,B00005MKKR,"I really enjoyed this movie.  It had the feel of being in that era.  If you're a history buff,  you'll like the way this movie was constructed.  Real Russian equipment,  Russian spoken throughout.  I don't have anything bad to say about this movie.",1287360000,,248,4.651162790697675
7945582,4,B00005MKKR,"This movie is well-made and stands out amongst European films for its quality.  Do not expect historical accuracy though.  The most hilarious scene in the film is when a commissar from Stalin's Russia asks a German how one man like Hitler could be made omnipotent.  MMMM you mean like Stalin and the unquestioning obedience on pain of death you give to your leader?

Although the film takes place around Berlin; they take the Spandau fort in one scene (where Speer and other top Nazis are later held following their war crimes convictions), nothing is shown of the hundreds of thousands of German women who were raped by Russian soldiers during this period in Berlin.  Thousands committed suicide after repeated rapes.  The Russians raped, pillaged and robbed their way through Germany, especially around Berlin, and they were savage, inhumane animals to a very large degree.  I'm sure there were decent soldiers as the hero is portrayed to be (I wonder if in real life he raped three or four women himself, probably), but there were many hundreds of thousands in this sector of the front who weren't.  Scenes depicting humane commissars and germans shooting at other germans to enable their own surrender are so far from reality that only a committed Communist would even attempt to put this on film.

An honest portrayal of this time would have shown both the Nazis and Communist Russians as the vile, inhuman animals they were.  Because it's a propaganda piece made in a Marxist slave state during the 1960's (East Germany), the Communists are laughably portrayed as decent.  If you can imagine the depths of living in a repressed Stalinist system, the East German film-makers are so slavish, they feel unable to even mention enormous human rights violations against their own people for fear of reprisal from Big Brother.

Take this film with a grain of salt.",1281830400,3,1863,4.916932907348243
7945583,5,B00005MKKR,"I have watched this film on DVD several times and plan to watch it again.

This would be a good film for anyone who is studying Russian or German.

There is a very complex interplay between Hecker, who is a German-Russian, Wadim who is a Russian Jew, and Sascha, who is Russian. Hecker is only nineteen and does not know much about the world. He was raised in Germany until he was 8 then his family moved to Moscow. So, his formative years were spend in Russia and he identifies himself as a Soviet. This leads to some interesting scenes in which he interacts with Germans who, in some cases, even know his family members. They are in turn fascinated by a ""German"" in a Soviet uniform who is appearing as a their conqueror.

His comrade Wadim is a Russian Jew who is also a German language teacher in his civilian profession. Wadim loves the German language, but must reconcile the defeat of Germany, the atrocities of the camps, and his friend Hecker's disinterest in German culture. At one point there is strife between Wadim and Hecker over this.

Sascha is a kommisar and takes care of young Hecker. He is like an older brother to Hecker. His character is uncomplicated by the internal conflicts of the others. Along with Dsingis, they provide a solid foundation for the conflicted Hecker and Wadim.

One of the most powerful scenes in the movie is at then end when Hecker and his captured German prisoners come under fire from a passing German convoy. A German prisoner, Willi Lommer, who had been disarmed, picks up a rifle to help Hecker defend their position. It's a pure ""us against them"" moment in which countries, uniforms, backgrounds, don't matter, only survival.

A complex and interesting movie worth not only watching, but studying.",1242864000,6,1748,4.696078431372549
7945584,5,B00005MKKR,"A fascinating amalgam of documentary, drama and history with a unique perspective on World War II that I've never quite encountered before. I wasn't fully aware that this was actually an East German propaganda film, although I did find myself wondering why all of the Russians in this movie were highly moral, heroic, friendly, and physically attractive.  Strongly recommended for history buffs. Subtitled.",1242691200,8,406,5.444444444444445
7945585,5,B00005MKKR,"I'll get the bad out of the way first... I generally hate full screen. I enjoy watching movies in their original aspect ratio (most movies are filmed in 16:9). I'm not sure if this movie was originally filmed in 4:3, but I was not happy to discover that this is the aspect ratio.

But, once I got done complaining and started really watching the movie, I found a deep film that's about more than just the war that it portrays. I really don't know how to explain it. It's one part anti-war film, one part coming of age film, one part comedy, and one part eomtional drama.

I really have to say that despite the disappointing aspect ratio, I found a lot to like here. When it gets too dramatic, the movie throws in some comedy. When it gets too triumphant, the movie reminds you that nothing great ever comes without sacrifice. It has some incredibly bizzare parts, but they fit well and the whole movie is well worth the twenty dollars.

I have a copy of this film that is from Germany with no subtitles. Since i speak both german and russian and am familiar with this point in history, i am very impressed with the realistic portrayal of the last days of WW2. Young Gregor Hecker, who is technically a german, but has grown up a russian and deals with trying to find out what it actually means to be ""german"", but the situations he faces and his experiences really can translate to just about anyone trying to find out what it means to be ""american"" or ""russian"" or ""french"" or anyone's nationality. He learns some very interesting lessons about himself and also about dealing with other individual people, and that one should never have any pre-concieved notions about groups of people. The most fascinating thing about this movie, is that it is a telling story of individuality and humanity, while the larger story of war is all around. I recommend this film to anyone (since it has subtitles) interested in WW2, because it will give a very accurate and interesting perspective of this time period.",1190505600,24,1251,4.63963963963964
