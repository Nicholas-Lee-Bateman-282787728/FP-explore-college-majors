7955933,1,B00005UWUK,This is The Villian.  Cactus jack is the character in the movie.  Be careful to purchase a legal copy.,1520380800,,102,4.315789473684211
7955934,3,B00005UWUK,"This is The Villian under a different name! Evidently 'over there, they changed the name. C.J. costs more and won't play here. Still funny and good, just beware of the downside.  ^_^",1516320000,,182,4.6875
7955935,1,B00005UWUK,it would not play on my DVD player,1488931200,,34,3.375
7955936,5,B00005UWUK,"Kind of 'tripped' over this movie while flipping channels. What fun it is. Absolutely ridiculous of course, like a cartoon as others say. (US title is ""The Villain""). A wonderful parody with a cast of Hollywood Gold ! I will be adding it to my DVD library!
I had never come across a Western parody before until I saw ""The Lone Ranger"" (which got such a bad rap. Johnny Depp extraordinary as usual.), but I thought that was very funny too, tho so much more subtle than this one. Guess that's why no one understood it. They were probably looking for a 'historic' film on the Lone Ranger.
This is pure fun. And Whisky (the horse) should have gotten an Oscar !",1453852800,,656,4.385245901639344
7955937,5,B00005UWUK,Did not realize this was a region 2 DVD when I ordered and was disappointed when would not play in my player.  Fortunately a while back I ordered a region free player and had it installed in bedroom.  A quick swap and was watching the movie.  Cartoonish yes but that is part of the charm of this western comedy.,1441497600,,311,4.237288135593221
