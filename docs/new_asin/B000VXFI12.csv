8220425,1,B000VXFI12,Love it! Really good workout for AB's without doing sit-ups. Fun too.,1472774400,,69,4.833333333333333
8220426,5,B000VXFI12,"This is a great exercise for all ages and fitness levels. It is very aerobic, but also has (non weight) strength training. My 80 year old mother and I (59 years old) Both use it, but a twenty year old will find it up to their level as well. Also, it is not obnoxious yelling, but good motivational instructions.",1465084800,,311,4.288135593220339

8220428,5,B000VXFI12,"This is a great workout, especially if you cannot get on the floor and do sit ups, etc.  Just be careful with your knees when your turning from side to side.",1382918400,,157,4.064516129032258

8220430,5,B000VXFI12,George Foreman gives a good workout and makes exercising fun. He also talks to all of the exercisers and makes them seem like friends after awhile.,1361750400,,147,4.6923076923076925
8220431,5,B000VXFI12,"I recently bought all eight Walk It Off with George DVDs that Amazon offers and I love them.  I'm always looking for new walking style workouts and these are true walking workouts - there are no complex combos or routines here.  While they all contain the same basic steps -walking in place, heel digs, side steps, the Foreman shuffle (three steps and a tap), etc. each DVD has a little different emphasis.  I did all eight in one week and I didn't find them repetitive at all.  Petra Kolber is such a fun, bubbly kind of personality and George is so encouraging.  The background exercises look like they are having a blast, not just smiling for the camera.

I started off with the Ab Walk and it was so much fun, time just flew by.  The walking workout incorportes several moves where you twist your waist and hips to work the abs.  After the cool down and stretch there is a short standing ab routine (about 5 minutes).  If you're looking to get six-pack abs, I don't think this will do it, but it did get my heart rate up and it was great doing some different moves than the usual walking steps.",1260921600,14,1098,4.369458128078818
