I'd seen the whole serie and this volumen,that have the first episodes of the serie(?) is aweson. I don't like what they did to the other volumes 'cause the episodes aren't in a perfect order like it should be. It has a lot of action scenes that will let you begging for more. Give it a try,it's just the best american animated show,at least the best action show.",1001116800,2,511,4.565217391304348
