8388976,4,B0035G77X4,"Not a great movie, but with particular scenes between Heston and each of his co-stars, and an overall subject matter that occasionally steer the movie into something well above-average for a made-for-TV flick.  Heston always adds a touch of class to anything he's in (only a few movies I never bothered to check against that working theory, such as something with him as an aging gangster, co-starring Ann Gillian, Original Sin (???), which just looked too bad to try).  John Savage is good as his estranged and in many respects frankly tiresome son.  This bit of casting was strong, given his resemblance to a young Heston insofar as facial features, even if he is a much smaller man than the physically-imposing Heston.  Maud Adams really never adds up to more than window dressing, as the woman torn between father and son, who cannot make up her mind between them and is hurtful to both with her tedious blithering.  John Rhys-Davis, in one of his first American broadcasts, is a breath of fresh air, adding life to those parts of the storyline that are predictable and stale, such as the trite resolution of the love triangle.  Worth the watch for Heston and Rhys-Davis, as well as the magnificent African settings.",1443225600,,1220,4.813397129186603
