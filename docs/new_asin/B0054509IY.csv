8456211,5,B0054509IY,"Finally, a movie with a good, good story!  Showed  me a slice of life in a part of the country I am so unfamiliar with - the Texas boondocks with its strong Hispanic history - and poignant coming-of age theme of a young girl striving for a better future. And amazing new high school sport? Power lifting, yes, for girls. Great twists & turns along the way.",1506902400,,356,4.298507462686567

8456213,1,B0054509IY,"Terrible movie, with a terrible plot, and a terrible ending. Less about powerlifting, more about an angry teenage girl.",1489881600,,119,5.315789473684211

8456215,1,B0054509IY,Horrible movie!  Turned it off in the first few minutes due to sexual content.  No wonder I couldn't find a review or rating.  Too bad - Could have had a great message.,1441584000,,168,4.1875
8456216,1,B0054509IY,"This could have been a much better story than it was.  Frankly, the female protagonist was extremely unsympathetic.  It was very difficult to root for her when she continued to make ridiculously foolish decisions and then, instead of learning from her mistakes and working her way through her troubles, she makes even more foolish decisions, alienating virtually everyone who has been trying to help her (family, friends, school personnel).  I lost any sympathy I may have started to have for Luz (the protagonist) when her stupid decisions/actions put her family and friends in jeopardy and she continued to lash out and act like a self centered idiot.  The ending was entirely improbable, and subplots were left unresolved, almost as if the film makers stopped when they ran out of money, rather than when they finished telling the story.  Overall, the story was not very fluid, with the character jumping from one irrational action to another.  It had the potential to be much better, it just didn't make it.",1406764800,,1011,4.988095238095238
8456217,5,B0054509IY,"This is a film about obstacles, temptations, fear, hard work, mistakes, and overcoming limitations.  So many people, especially young people, can't see their way out of a situation.  They feel stuck and feel the only way out is to win something.  I admire the work ethic of the character Luz.  This film leaves me with a feeling of hope at the end.",1369526400,3,348,4.564516129032258
8456218,4,B0054509IY,"In Texas a Latina aspires to attend college. With no $ she aspires for a scholarship in weightlifting.  She has a boyfriend and she works.  One brother works at the oil field and another brother is in the Army.

When it appears that another girl may out do her she (foolishly) opts for 'roids to get stronger.  In the process she gains weight as muscle weighs more than fat, so she is DQed.

From there things go to pieces in every way and she ends up jailed. A big mess. Then, briefly, it turns into&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frozen-River/dp/B0021QKQF0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frozen River</a>.

Following the big mess she drives to the college and demands to be allowed to enroll. Why? I do not know. The Head of Admissions tells her to go to JU CO and maybe that will work out. At times feels like a Latina&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vision-Quest/dp/B001R20VM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vision Quest</a>.",1368230400,,1008,5.8231292517006805
8456219,5,B0054509IY,"Luz Garcia (Corina Calderon) wants to go to the University of Texas. She can get loans, but that isn't good enough as her family is strapped for money. She wants the free ride of a scholarship which she plans on getting through power lifting. She has to win the state tournament for her weight class. Power lifting is NOT an NCAA sport and universities therefore don't award full scholarships. Texas offers 12 $500.00 scholarships to seniors with 3.0 grade average or better. I will try not to let reality ruin the story, but $500 doesn't go far at the University of Texas.

Luz has a pot smoking boyfriend (Jeremy Ray Valdez) who is perhaps a typical teen male which clashes with Luz's desire to go to UT. She also has a slight problem maintaining her 114 pound weight for her class...and has a nasty habit of spitting. Her overwhelming desire to get out of town makes Luz her own worst enemy as she disobeys her coach and has teen snits. She rejects the idea that local inexpensive college options might still allow her to achieve her life goals.

The movie has real characters and not the cookie-cut type. They have elements of both good and bad with a plot that doesn't go where you expect it to go. There were some plot elements that were improbable with a steroid sniffing dog topping the list.

Some basic life lessons: If a policeman with one amazing drug sniffing dog asks, ""Whose jacket is this?"" Do not say, ""Mine,"" even if it is your jacket.

The movie started out as a boring 3 star ""Karate Kid"" story, but as things become real, the film becomes a really good indie.

No sex, no nudity (some butt/bra/panties) and no F-bombs. Teen drinking/ pot use. Public urination. Minor PG swearing. 5 star movie for female teens.",1327708800,6,1731,4.570967741935484
8456220,5,B0054509IY,"A story for young and old.  Can we escape the restraints put on us - external or internal - in order to reach our destination?  I liked the true-to-life presentation of the issues and people of south Texas today, and the interplay of relationships of a teenager as she struggles with her hopes and demons. Fine writing, acting and directing.",1320019200,9,341,4.666666666666667
