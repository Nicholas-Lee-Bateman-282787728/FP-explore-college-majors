8539479,5,B000QGP6P2,This video captures an amazing 60 minute behind the scenes film which you wouldn't usually see in a concert. This has it all from the start when the band rehearse and get to know each other to them setting up the stage and finishing the final touches. This is a very intersting and exciting video to watch. I highley recommned this to all phil collins fans.,1247097600,,357,4.424242424242424
