8320187,2,B001LVXZUY,"I was disappointed as all hell in this DVD, feel like I wasted my money. Production value similar to what you'd get on a YouTube channel, lots of loud and emphatic talking by self important blowhards but precious little insightful info. The clincher is the irritating music that plays way too loud and is an irritating distraction. In my opinion. Don't waste your money. There's free s*** like this on YouTube if you're bored. Or I'll send you my copy for free. Seriously, I will.",1420070400,,480,4.658823529411765
