7799532,5,0967618509,"Wonderful documentary about the basic but beautiful art and history of the American Indian flute. Extraordinary production that concisely describes the origin and meaning of the flute from the unique perspectives of different representatives of different tribes. I personally know Kevin Locke, and can attest to the spiritual personality he portrays in this video. Everything said is truly from the heart, and I have no trouble believing the other individuals are every bit as honest and authentic as Kevin is. Surely, no one will be disappointed with this production. One last thing: the non-indian world needs to stop refering to these folks as ""native americans"". After spending much time with indian people on reservations, you find out that they call themselves ""Indians"" or ""American Indians"" or by their tribal names or Tom, Dick, or Harry but not ""Native Americans"".Don't believe me? Check out Russel Mean's web site.",981158400,4,925,5.299319727891157
