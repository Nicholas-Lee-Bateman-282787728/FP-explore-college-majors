8515135,5,B007EAFTTQ,"I became a fan of Warren Brown after watching Luther and Inside Men. I was pleasantly surprised at how he took his role as Rocksavage and made it his own. He really does an excellent job of portraying a man with an agenda with the goal of avenging. Like all BBC shows, you can't help but get caught up in the story line almost immediately. I think anyone who is a fan of Luther and want to see more of Warren Brown and his acting ability buy this series!",1378080000,,454,4.112359550561798
8515136,5,B007EAFTTQ,"I saw previous previews that stated that this show is a little dark. (True That) Storyline that is, but that make it more intriguing. It's no more dark than LUTHER,REBUS,CASE HISTORIES,VERA and The New Sherlock. Warren Brown give a outstanding performance. He has a true Fan here in the States. BBC AMERICA please pick this DVD, because I heard that season 2 is already out. WARNING for those who live in The Good Old U.S. of A & Canada, are DVD players are coded in Region 1.
