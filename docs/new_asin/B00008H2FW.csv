The saga starts with Goku returning to Earth for 24 hours, so he can compete in the World Martial Arts Tournament.  The Z Fighters all qualify for the round of 16, but so do a handful of other mysterious fighters.  Goku and his friends have a strange encounter with two strangers, Shin and Kibito, that are anxious to meet him.

The pairing up of the final 16 contestants pits Piccolo against the mysterious Shin, Gohan against the other mysterious being named Kibito, and Goku and Vegeta are matched up in the first round for what is for sure to be an epic and long overdue rematch.

However, the circumstances of the tournament change when Videl's fight with a man named Spopovich turns for the worst.  Spopovich reveals unnatural strength and techniques that he never had before.  But Spopovich and his partner Yamu, another contestant, seem to be searching for something among the final 16 contestants.  What is they are looking for?  Who are Shin and Kibito?  Who will win Goku or Vegeta?  You will have to watch it to find out!",1374969600,,1233,4.579908675799087

7984078,5,B00008H2FW,"Although this World Tourney Saga pales in comparison to the ones in Dragonball, it is still a good saga.  There is a new Junior Division, and a broad array of really powerful characters that enter.  It's a good buy, and leads up to the epic Buu Sagas, which are also good sagas.  Even though tape is cheaper, you get two versions on DVD, Japanese and English, in its uncut glory.",1083628800,14,379,4.385714285714286
