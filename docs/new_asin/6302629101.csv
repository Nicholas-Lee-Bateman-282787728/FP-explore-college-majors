486912,2,6302629101,"This film fails to engage the viewer.  Unlike the first one, the characters do not develop, there is no humor whatsoever, and the beast is just a brainless brute run amok rather than a military hero under severe and tragic stress.  This one isn't even suspenseful or scary, it just kind of plods along:  he is found, subdued, escapes, and meets his end.

Not recommended.",1305676800,3,371,4.661538461538462
486913,3,6302629101,"Hollywood Trivia: Oddly enough, the Producers of the two films seemed to think that cast changes and storyline shifts in WAR OF THE COLOSSAL BEAST meant that this film could not be presented as a sequel. Thus, THE AMAZING COLOSSAL MAN has no official sequel.

Regardless of its status as a non-sequel, Colonel Glenn Manning of THE AMAZING COLOSSAL MAN returns in this less engaging follow up film. At the end of the original film, the insane Colonel Manning is apparently killed by his fall off the Hoover Dam. WAR OF THE COLOSSAL BEAST opens with a fearsome mystery: Bread trucks are found in the Southwestern desert emptied of both cargo and drivers. A team sent to investigate the situation finds the trucks marked with huge fingerprints.

Just as they figure out that Colonel Manning may be the cause of these disappearances, Manning's head unexpectedly pops onto the screen with an animalistic groan. This is without a doubt the most startling moment in the film. Manning is horribly scarred and has a gaping empty eye socket. Any non-snoring viewer will jump in their seat.

Unfortunately, WAR OF THE COLOSSAL BEAST never surpasses this early shock point. Colonel Manning is no longer simply crazed by having been rendered a giant, he is now suffering from amnesia and a head trauma which has rendered him truly beastlike. The story stays one-dimensionally set on the U.S. Military's repeated attempts to kill Manning (and Manning's sister's attempts to return him to sanity). There is no character development at all, and COLOSSAL BEAST lacks the unintended humor of COLOSSAL MAN's rampage through Vegas. It's nowhere as good as its predecessor, but the two films make a nice set of 1950s Monster Mash, nevertheless.",1303776000,5,1723,4.975694444444445

7828167,5,6302629101,"Movie isn't really 5 stars,
 but the 5 stars are for living up to my childhood memories of it.

B-movie cheesy-ness literally looms large in this classic second part to ""The Amazing Colossal Man"", which I also looked for, but didn't find.

I remembered it well from ""Creature Double Feature"" Saturday, and was happy to find it here for just $3.
 Unfortunately it didn't show up on my linked VuDu account,
but since Vudu doesn't list this on their site at all I wasn't surprised.

Now I'm just looking for a digi-copy of ""The Thing that Couldn't Die"",
 and the rest of my childhood nightmares will be faced :-D",1517443200,,609,4.541284403669724
