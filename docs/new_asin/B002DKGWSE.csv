3910783,3,B002DKGWSE,"Wes Craven's The Last House on the Left was released in 1972 and I heard from many people who were old enough to see it when it first came out (like my dad) that it was the most shocking thing anyone had ever seen. To this day the original is still a raw and often disgusting piece of cinema, so being that in 2009 films can push the envelope even more, I didn't know how far this thing would go.

It's shocking, brutal and gross, but it didn't just go the buckets of blood route. Yes, there is some gore, but compared to films like Hostel and SAW this is quite tame. What does get under your skin is the rape scene. I read that some people witnessed others leave the theater at this point and they never came back. I guess they didn't see the original or read up on what they paid to see before plopping in their seat. It shows little skin compared to the 1972 version, but it's a long scene that is painful to watch.

The cast is quite good, though most are actors whose names you won't know. The father, played by Tony Goldwyn, and the leader of the killers, played by Garrett Dillahunt were the standouts.

For a film as gritty as this one, the cinematography is polished and takes away a little bit of the raw power that the original had. I actually don't think Wes Craven's 1972 flick holds up well today and thought this remake was better.

Make sure you are in the right frame of mind before seeing this one. By that I mean, don't watch The Last House on the Left and expect to be in a good mood when you leave. While it's a pleasure to see the parents take out the villains one by one to avenge their daughter, you will leave the theater looking for the bright sun to make you feel clean again. Too bad it was raining when I got out. Don't worry, I think I'll be okay.",1246060800,142,1777,4.142028985507246
3910784,5,B002DKGWSE,Watched this picture a few days ago and it is simply facinating in the mood it creates. The original was in all fairness brilliant for it's time but a re make for the new generation was long overdue and boy did they get it right. The rape scene is extremely tough to stomach and the gore factor is certainly not easy on the eyes but the revenge driven parents are a joy to watch for fans of this genre. Very satisfying ending. For the few out there who have not seen the original i would reccommend watching this version and please keep an open mind. To summarize...this picture can be extremely disturbing from time to time but the end result makes the ride worthwhile. Keep a special place in your mind for this style of horror/thriller as it won't leave you easily. Definitely one for the books.,1245715200,51,798,4.4353741496598635

3910796,2,B002DKGWSE,"Good cast acting but I feel like if you've seen the original, you just can't love this one. This was like a cheesy teen slasher compared to the original. They completely lost the edge of the original and made the story too cookie cutter and Hollywood for my taste, they even gave it a tragic backstory with her brother. Part of the impact of the original was that they were a regular and wholesome family that had the worst thing happen to them and shatter their mundane world.",1519776000,,477,4.431818181818182
3910797,4,B002DKGWSE,"I have never seen what other reviewers refer to as ""the original"" so I can only review this movie not give a comparison.  Although predictable at times the movie kept me interested and the intrigue/drama was enough to keep me watching.  There were times I wanted to scream at the stupid girls yet they never deserved what happened to them.  The determination of the main female lead character to not only live but get to her parents was amazing acting and for that I give this 4 stars.  Acting was great, dialogue believable and movie worth watching!",1519603200,,550,4.639175257731959

3910801,1,B002DKGWSE,"Listened to the good reviews instead of the bad. This movie is trash do not waste your time. It is basically a revenge movie, but the revenge part only takes up the last act. The first two acts are you being bored by watching thugs kill innocent people and teenagers smoke weed. Also a really graphic rape scene. That is what the first hour and change is. The last revenge act isn't even that great either because of the lack of common sense. The father misses two point blank shots that would have ended the movie that nobody would have missed. Uneccesary sneaking around the house when you could just set it on fire and smoke the person out. Lack of common sense is what this movie should be called. Anyone rating this 5 stars calling this some type of classic is out of their mind.",1514592000,2,784,4.376712328767123

The movie is full of emotions, once it gets going and I like movies that gets the emotions , feelings going ,  Suspense is great,  Only part of movie that was hard to watch was the rape scene, intense and sadly unforgettable.  The movie has great acting done,  and I do like the movie, JUST NOT FOR AGES UNDER 18.  In life once you see something you cant unsee it  -  and the scene that can't be unseen is surely not for under 18 years of age. Movie is thrilling,, suspense, root for the good guys, This movie is a good one, just be careful when you reach that one scene it is Very graphic and is not a glimpse of time either.",1508803200,,704,4.087591240875913

3910807,4,B002DKGWSE,"A violent family frees one of their own, a prisoner being driven between locations.  Meanwhile a teenage girl and her parents have arrived at their lakeside remote holiday house.  The teen wants to borrow the car and drive into town where a friend from her annual vacations works in a convenience store. A teen from the violent family comes into the shop to buy cigarettes, the girls end up back in his motel room to do drugs.  His family comes home, they're on the front pages of the newspapers and are not letting these girls go.  They steal the teen's car and bring the terrified girls with them.  The girls fight back, this angers the family who take brutal vengeance on the two.  But they suffer their own injuries in doing so and are now on foot.  The nearest house they can go for help, is the one the teen left earlier that day.

Quite a good film and quite realistic other than the final scene, which I'm pretty sure you need to close the door for it to work.  Sure it's one of those films where screaming girls stop running when they should just keep going, the parents leave each partner one on one to fight instead of teaming up time and time again, and a the opening freedom plan required a train to be there at the exact right time.  But still it's a lot of high tension fun!",1506902400,,1289,4.3112033195020745

3910811,4,B002DKGWSE,"I think this was way better than the original, the original movie lacked a proper storyline and you cant really grasp the characters experiences and mentality, it was fast paced unrealistic and bad casting compared to how the 2009 one is now. This one felt more real and watching the rape scene was pretty disturbing where in the original it seemed as though it was just acting. Normally I like originals compared to their remake and I was born in the 90s and watched the original when I was a kid [not with parental permission] and rewatched it after watching this. It feels like this could easily happen to anyone in the wrong place. The original wasn't scary or upsetting like other horror movies made around the same time it felt like it wasn't that well thought out and seemed like just a movie. This one has the type of scare that hits you in reality which is the only scare that scary movies offer anyone who is really into them, when you are into horrors and thrillers nothing in movies really scares you until it hits home and real life. In good thrillers you get an after scare that doesn't last but makes you pretty uncomfortable. The original didn't feel like anything to me both times I watched it. This one sets in my mind and has since I first watched it in 2009. Definitely worth watching over the original movie",1501804800,2,1328,4.491735537190083

Its extremely intense, realistic, brutal, scary and relentlessly suspenseful. The direction and performances are stellar especially from the villains. They are truly some of the most despicable villains to ever grace the silver screen and the actors who play them do an outstanding job which one of them includes Aaron Paul. There is a brutal, long and graphic rape scene that is very hard to watch but at the same time that's also the point. This is one superb thriller.

3910878,4,B002DKGWSE,"Wes Craven's The Last House on the Left was released in 1972 and I heard from many people who were old enough to see it when it first came out (like my dad) that it was the most shocking thing anyone had ever seen. To this day the original is still a raw and often disgusting piece of cinema, so being that in 2009 films can push the envelope even more, I didn't know how far this thing would go.

It's shocking, brutal and gross, but it didn't just go the buckets of blood route. Yes, there is some gore, but compared to films like Hostel and SAW this is quite tame. What does get under your skin is the rape scene. I read that some people witnessed others leave the theater at this point and they never came back. I guess they didn't see the original or read up on what they paid to see before plopping in their seat. It shows little skin compared to the 1972 version, but it's a long scene that is painful to watch.

The cast is quite good, though most are actors whose names you won't know. The father, played by Tony Goldwyn, and the leader of the killers, played by Garrett Dillahunt were the standouts.

For a film as gritty as this one, the cinematography is polished and takes away a little bit of the raw power that the original had. I actually don't think Wes Craven's 1972 flick holds up well today and thought this remake was better.

Make sure you are in the right frame of mind before seeing this one. By that I mean, don't watch The Last House on the Left and expect to be in a good mood when you leave. While it's a pleasure to see the parents take out the villains one by one to avenge their daughter, you will leave the theater looking for the bright sun to make you feel clean again. Too bad it was raining when I got out. Don't worry, I think I'll be okay.",1464825600,3,1777,4.142028985507246

3910907,5,B002DKGWSE,"This movie is not another stupid B movie that wants to please male fantasy.
It has no graphic nudity or rape nudity scene.
It is a really well made thriller.
I've seen some really bad movies in this category like <I spit on your grave (Remake) . Now that one was so stupid.
Compare to that one, I was so deeply fall into this movie that I couldn't think of other things for the last 30-40 minutes.
When the guys come to the girl's house that they raped not knowing that that is the girl's house, because they were brutally injured by a car accidant, and the girl's parents found out that they are the guys who raped their girl, from that on, the movie becomes really a top notch thriller. And the parents' revenge part is not a bit cliche. It is so natural and intense. They had to deal with the killer from not knowing that their raped daughter is back at home totally exhausted and also on the other hand, they had to revenge them.
I haven't seen anything this well done movie for some time.
The parents and bad guys were really good actors although they are not popular actors. The only thing I can complain is the daughter. She has no charm at all. But it was ok since her roll was so small.
The background music also really helped the intensity well.
I briefly saw the original movie by Wes Craven and I can see that the rape scene involves intense full body nudity and all. It was for male fantasy and I didn't liked it at all. Making movie is for audience anyway. That one (The original Last house on the left) was more like B movie. Hungry for new audience.
But this movie is a bit different. This one is a really well made thriller.
You better watch this. There is so much to learn from it.
PS: I don't know about the UNRATED VERSION why it had to be unrated. There in nothing seriously disturbing image at all. Adding a few footages doesn't always mean they should be UNRATED.",1453248000,,1886,4.270949720670391

3910930,3,B002DKGWSE,"Dennis Iliadiss The Last House on the Left is a remake of Wes Cravens 1972 exploitation film of the same name (which is in turn loosely based on Ingmar Bergmans 1960 film The Virgin Spring).  The premise is familiar territory for anyone who keeps up with the rape-revenge subgenre of horror (which includes such American classics as Chaos and I Spit on Your Grave): Mari (Sara Paxton) and Paige (Martha MacIsaac) are two blissfully unaware teen girls who run afoul of a gang of murderous psychopaths.  After viciously attacking the girls and leaving them to die in the woods, the gang unknowingly takes refuge in the house of their latest victim (as the murderous leader Krug vocalizes at one point: What are the odds, man?).  Maris parents soon realize who theyve allowed into their home, and thus begins the bloody fight for revenge.

 Deciding how many stars to give this film represents one of the hardest decisions Ive grappled with during a review.  Although I eventually went with three stars, theres no way a mere number can concisely sum up my conflicted feelings for The Last House on the Left.

 What we have here is a film with a case of identity crisis: one that cant decide if its a wacky gore-fest or a gut-wrenching drama, one that isn't sure if it wants to condone sadism or condemn it.  It felt to me like I was watching two different genres wrestling for screen time.

 Before I go any further, lets address the elephant in the room.  The rape scene in The Last House on the Left is, without question, one of the most awful things Ive ever seen committed to film.  Its unflinching, its brutal, and its the scene people will be talking about long after theyve forgotten other details of the film.  Ive only ever walked out of a movie once (during Michael Hanekes reprehensible 2007 remake of Funny Games), but I came very close to walking out of this onemore out of sheer discomfort than disgust.  I have seen similar sequences in films across a variety of genres: Evil Dead (and its 2013 remake), North Country, American History X, The Hills Have Eyes, 12 Years a Slave, and even extreme films like Irreversible and A Serbian Film.  None of them got under my skin and left me as rattled as Last House did.  This scene is prolonged, its realistic, and its made all the more painful by Sara Paxtons fantastic performance throughout.

 The now-infamous rape scene is so uncomfortable and so effective that it pains me to call it exploitative.  Sadly, exploitation is what it ultimately amounts to; the rape is a set-up for the gore-filled revenge scenes that constitute the films second half, in which Maris parents (Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter) dispatch their daughters tormentors in increasingly gruesome and theatrical fashion.  The level of sadism is ratcheted up to the point that the atrocities witnessed in the first half begin to feel like little more than an excuse.

 There is no joy in the violence during the first half; we are left appalled and heartbroken at the ordeal these young women suffer through.  In the second half, conversely, were obviously meant to get a sick thrill out of watching the killers get their comeuppance, but in the end my sadness over the victims suffering won out over my anger toward the antagonists.  Gut-wrenching as the rape scene is, it begins to feel cheap once we realize that its inclusion is utilized only as a setup for excessive bloodshed.

 Mari isn't granted a single line of dialogue following her ordeal at the hands of Krug and his gang.  After being victimized, she has apparently served her purpose and exists only as a motivation for her parents to take revenge.  Its especially disappointing because, as I mentioned before, Paxton is an underrated actress who kills it in this role despite the brief time shes given.  Were Iliadis less concerned with adhering to the formula of the original, LHOTL had the potential to make some powerful statements about survival and the nature of violencebut instead were treated to a tired revenge theme that serves little purpose beyond making Maris parents less relatable.  Its certainly understandable and even natural for parents to want justice when their child has been brutalized...but theres a difference between acting out of passion and staging elaborate SAW-style executions.

 SPEAKING OF WHICH, the absurd and unnecessary final kill that concludes the film undermines nearly every redeemable aspect of it.  Its a terrible, juvenile note to end on, and Im rather dumbfounded that Iliadis thought anyone would find it satisfying.  Even more insulting is how this scene is intercut with a genuinely beautiful ending sequence that would have worked perfectly well on its own.  So much potential here is squandered on crass violence.

 This review sounds rather negative and pissy, doesnt it?  I must reiterate that The Last House on the Left is a solid thriller, all things considered.  Those who can stomach the level of violence will probably find things to enjoy, as the film is extremely well-made with gorgeous cinematography and a soundtrack by John Murphy (of the excellent 28 Days Later) that fluctuates between pulse-pounding electronic rock and distant, mournful piano themes that superbly punctuate the films most devastating moments.  The suspense is handled well throughout, and if you're a fan of this sort of horror, know that its miles better than the usual schlock of this subgenre (Funny Games and The Strangers come to mind).  Indeed, there are moments of brilliance to be found here: the standout moment for me was when Maris parents discover her after the attack.  Despite the dubious morals on display, Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter give spot-on performances, and their believable concern and tenderness toward the brutalized Mari gives the film some much-needed heart.  Everything about the scene is outstanding, and here we get another glimpse of the story this could have been.

 Overall, this strikes me as the Full Metal Jacket of horror movies.  While I would give the films first half at least four stars, the second half deserves no more than two.  So lets split the difference and call it a three.  Again, giving a star rating to this film hardly feels appropriate; The Last House on the Left shook me up, and thats not something you can assign a numerical value to.  This is a flawed film that many will find difficult to watch, but theres some serious potential here and Im excited by the thought of future interpretations.",1442448000,,6482,4.874885844748858

It's interesting how the mother finds out that the people they have taken in are the ones that have shot and molested their daughter.

  My girlfriend Tammy had a pleasant surprise for me when I visited her condo this past Friday.  She had purchased the 2009 remake of the classic Wes Craven shocker, ""The Last House on the Left.""  This is the infamous film in which the vacationing Dr. John Collingwood and his wife Emma seek revenge against those who brutalized their daughter Mari and her friend Paige.  I found it just as gritty and disturbing as the original 1972 film.  Therefore, if you didn't enjoy the original, you probably won't tolerate the remake either.  They are very similar in plot; however, they are dissimilar enough so that those who've seen the original will still enjoy the remake.

  It has been over twenty years since I've seen the original but it still remains forever etched in my memory.  The 2009 remake had more brutality than the original; however, its ending was more agreeable.  In the case of this shocker, you need an ending that lifts the feeling of doom and gloom that settles on one's shoulders while watching it.  The remake has a ""happy ending"" in which the surviving characters literally sail away into the sunset.  Furthermore, one of the ruffians experiences a rather grisly, highly creative death at the hands of the revenge-seeking Dr. Collingwood.  Viewers will understand his anger and not be too quick to judge him.

  The acting was great from all those involved.  Garrett Dillahunt (""Looper"" and ""Winter's Bone"") was especially good at reprising the role of the amoral, ruggedly-handsome Krug Stillo.  Originally, David Hess (""House on the Edge of the Park"" and ""Swamp Thing"") portrayed Krug.  Hess had a special gift for playing the ruffian who terrorizes innocent people, especially attractive women.  Not only was the acting great, perhaps even better than the original, but the sets in the remake were more lavish and appropriate.  In the remake, the large, isolated lake house is a couple of miles from the nearest neighbor.  The water also plays a more vital, significant role.

  I have not seen the remake of ""I Spit on Your Grave,"" which is another controversial revenge shocker that was originally released in 1978.  The original stars the lovely Camille Keaton, granddaughter of Buster Crabbe, as Jennifer Hills who is renting a secluded cabin in upstate New York; she seeks a gruesome, bloody revenge against the local rednecks who rape and brutalize her without mercy.  Either the originals or the remakes of ""I Spit on Your Grave"" and ""The Last House on the Left"" should be watched together as a double midnight feature.  Both films pose the question:  How far would you go to get revenge against the thugs who harmed you or a loved one?

Paige is in to weed, so they go to a hotel. Mari is not interested in weed, but Paige is keeping her waiting, so she goes into the hotel room and finds Paige and Justin smoking.
  Mari tells her mom on the cell phone she is going to stay with Paige for the night.
  Later, Giles walks into the hotel room and sees his son, Justin. Frank and Sadie are with him. Giles is mean and abusive to his son. Trouble begins for Justin, Mari and Paige.

This review is from an Australian buff, so my take on the film may be a little different.

***THERE ARE PLOT SPOILERS BELOW***

I came to this movie with a fair degree of caution. Several years ago I hired the original version, and the differences are marked, and not necessarily to the latest version's credit.

However, despite the issues I had with the film, let's start with the pluses. Most importantly, Garrett Dillahunt is again a revelation. Anyone who has seen him in No Country for Old Men, let alone the two characters he played in Deadwood (especially the masterful turn as `Mr W'), will know this is an actor who only comes along once in a while.

Dillahunt's turn as the primary villain in this piece is for the most part quite extraordinary. He is menacing, unpredictable, ruthless, cold, manipulative, reckless, brutal, not to mention an extremely violent individual - a very convincing psychopath, and I do not use that word lightly.

Aaron Paul does not rate a mention on the jacket, but he is similarly excellent, equally unpleasant and a total grub. It is difficult to explain just how well Paul and Dillahunt inhabit their characters without watching the film to see what I am talking about.

The actress who is also part of the above two characters' gang is also very convincing although she is given very little to do and it is not really ever explained why she is there.

Similarly with the presence of Spencer Treat Clark who made his name in Gladiator and forever since has been cast (in the films I have seen) with a very similar haircut. Such as in Mystic River. Here, he is supposed to be Dillahunt's son but they look nothing like each other and the relationship, such as it is, is hardly forged to a convincing degree.

It would have made more sense had Clark been, for example, a street kid that Dillahunt had taken under his wing to school in crime, but here in this remake it just rings false, although Clark is convincing as a kid caught in a world of bad who does not want any part of what he sees.

Sara Paxton puts in a remarkable performance as the young woman who runs into the above lot and has a horrific time - I'll leave it at that. As does her character's friend, an actress whose name escapes me but who is also terrific in her role.

The scene where the girls and Clark are in the motel when the real crims return unexpectedly is beautifully handled and is genuinely unsettling.

The scenes involving rape and other violence against both girls are hard to watch (as it should be), but it is a credit to all involved that in no way can the scenes be described as gratuitous.

However, at this point I would urge caution for those with a weak stomach who think they are going to be watching one of those thrillers with by-the-numbers plot changes with no real surprises. This film is not for young adults but mature adults who can watch this stuff and walk away thinking about it.

In other words, this film is a serious movie with some very serious things to say. The commitment by all involved to this project was flawless and that adds greatly to the end effect - no one is sleepwalking through their role in this film, for sure.

I can't really talk about what I thought could have been done better without giving some of the plot away, so anyone who doesn't want to hear how it ends...

One of the pluses of the film was that it was mostly very tightly edited and tightly scripted. However there is little backstory to any of the characters.

In the opening scene that is excellently pulled off, the SUV holding Dillahunt's character and two Marshalls is rammed at the side by another large vehicle driven by Paul's character. The two Marshalls are either killed outright or badly injured, yet Dillahunt emerges virtually unscathed - I didn't buy it.

I thought Tony Goldwyn (you may have seen him do a brilliant job in a few episodes of Dexter as the rather manipulative psychotherapist) was miscast in this film. Although he was a medical professional, which I felt was a bit of a clich, he was not really up to a great range of expression (which I admit was partly driven by the plot i.e. where he features prominently is basically in the wake of his realisation of who the gang really are). But I thought his character was pretty two-dimensional.

Monica Potter, on the other hand, did a brilliant job in inhabiting her role as the mother to Sara Paxton's character. I haven't seen Potter in much lately but in this I thought she was terrific. However, I felt no connection between Paxton, Goldwyn and Potter - it was just a stereotypical family which sat oddly with the chaos and anarchy we had sat through already, as delivered by the gang members.

People trying to find things desperately through pouring rain is also another stock element to any number of thrillers I care to mention.

That is what irritated me the most about this movie - the earlier scenes with the gang were done so brilliantly, and yet the latter half of the film reverted very much to a fairly predictable sequence of events that felt and looked like a completely different film.

I cannot remember too much about the original film, except that it was made at a time when cinema generally was pushing boundaries and going to pretty dark places which is why they became cult classics and deservedly so.

There is something unique about them, having been made in that strange era in the Seventies where we really took the lid of some things are stared into the abyss for a while (in some instances for a lot longer than we perhaps should have).

What am I trying to say? Such movies in that era (the original films) were notorious in their era, were banned in many places, and often badly cut by the censors (to do so was a disgrace, in my opinion). They were disturbing, horrifying, and genuinely haunted you for days afterwards.

Perhaps that is always going to be the problem with a remake - it will never capture the impact of the original, given we have become so used to such violence in cinema, of the cartoon variety or of the unremittingly bleak and full-frontal variety.

Some may think I am being overly picky, but I thought this remake could have been great, but it lost its way and became just another `they done his family wrong' revenge piece.

It may just be a matter of the compromises the artists have to make these days with the financiers to get anything made at all that is this good (as it was in so many respects). But it just feels like they got to a certain point in the script and decided to put the thing on auto pilot, injecting some very predictable and obvious references to past classics.

The scene where Goldwyn's character puts Dillahunt's head in the microwave and it explodes was both gratuitous and too silly for words. If it was meant to be a clever reference to the head-in-the-television scene in Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, then it was ill-advised.

That is my point. `Henry: Portrait...' with Michael Rooker in the lead, was a masterful, horrendously terrifying ordeal dealing with the subject matter in a way that has not been done, in my humble opinion, as well since. And to try to recreate that masterful achievement is both impossible and slightly hubristic, and doomed to failure.

As for the final scenes in which the father (Goldwyn) manages to apparently find the keys to the boat, and the safe, nuclear family zoom off down the river (cue credits) was a total wipe-out given what had been established in the earlier part of the film.

I will give two examples to illustrate the difference between half-way decent and brilliant achievements in films.

The first is Django Unchained (Tarantino), which I consider to be a modern cinematic masterpiece. However, the scenes involving the slave fights and the dogs attacking the runaway slave, amongst many other scenes in the film, were amongst the most difficult to watch and disturbing that I have encountered in a long time.

Given his past reputation based on his previous films, Tarantino took a significant risk by boldly tackling such a raw subject, but he pulled it off brilliantly, albeit creating a storm of controversy. But that is exactly my point.

The second film I would mention in respect to the depiction of violence is Pasolini's Salo, which I saw once many years ago in a cinema and have never been able to go back to it since.

The film's disturbing scenes, and there are many, cannot be described here, however my point is that the director had something original to say and achieved something quite unique that was deeply disturbing and highly artistic at the same time.

Of course, I am comparing this movie remake to some of the greatest Directors ever, which is unfair. But it serves to illustrate the point.

Perhaps I am being overly pedantic, and I know a lot of people probably have watched this remake and thought it was very well done. On several levels, I would agree. It had a lot going for it, and for Dillahunt's performance alone it is worth seeing.

However, I was disappointed how badly the film deteriorated to stock resolutions and some highly unoriginal images that felt in execution (no pun intended) little better than a high-school horror spoof.

In summary, there was much in this remake that could have made it great all the way through. It is still better than most of what else is served up as `cinema' these days.

But I do long for another film that is quite original and fairly knocks my socks off.

One movie that did something quite remarkable and terribly disturbing was The Girl Next Door directed by Gregory Wilson with a brilliant performance by Blanche Baker and terrific supporting cast (definitely not for those with a faint heart - a very disturbing film).

The last film that did that for me that I'll mention was No Country for Old Men which was so brilliantly executed that the seamlessness and perfection of every scene made it appear a disarmingly simple plot.

The whole point is that truly great films make you think about a whole series of questions/ideas/theories/etc., whereas this remake of The Last House on the Left just left me feeling a tad under sedation.",1374364800,5,10354,4.684674751929438

Compared to the other big remake, I Spit On Your Grave, this one is far superior. There is even the addition of a hospital scene to give you some back story about Mari's father. This also helps everything add up perfectly when he has to operate on one of the thugs and his own daughter towards the end.

This is simply a much tighter and slicker version of the original although the Sadie character in the original was played a lot more maliciously by Jeramie Rain while 'Krug' in this version is a little too pretty-boy compared to David Hess so only 4 stars. Obviously the acting is going to be a lot better overall than decades ago because Craven has a lot more cash to spend on the remake than he did for the original.

The addition of a fourth antagonist was a surprise in the first act but by the end you realise how essential he is to the plot overall.

Craven clearly still had a pretty tight grip on the reins creatively to make sure all the details locked in like a well oiled machine. He was especially careful to show how much of a masterful swimmer Mari is in the opening scenes. This seemingly trivial detail is anything but though because she just makes it back home, after being beaten, raped and finally shot, obviously due to her many years of dedicated training in the pool etc.

While I Spit On Your Grave in remake is seriously flawed, (see my review), this one is far more successful. The exclusion of the 'castration' scene will more than likely annoy fans of the original but the 'waste disposal' and 'microwave' scenes should be enough of a compromise.

Some people complain about the music in the original but a lot of the music (mostly by Hess himself) including the theme is clearly a major influence for bands like Zero 7, Kaki King and the like.",1347235200,,2023,4.439353099730458

3911100,3,B002DKGWSE,"Remakes of classic films like this are always by people who have already seen the original, or those who haven't. The inherent problem in that is that you already have an opinion of the original, and hence you have things about it you really liked or really didn't like. Well, if you never saw the original, you don't have to worry about that, and chances are you'll like it much better while staying ignorant of the original.

So, let's answer the obvious questions. Is it a good remake? Well, no; It just doesn't seem to understand the core of the original, and hence is sort of cheap and a somewhat quirky slasher versus slasher flick. It never feels like it has the heart of the original, nor does it have anywhere near the quality of its own. Is it a good film on its own? Well, yeah, it's pretty good, and would be better if the original never existed. As someone who has seen the original, it's very saddening to see unwelcome changes that just make your heart sink.

Let's try to make this real brief. Let's start with the good: This remake has a cool style that works, good actors for the bad guys and just-OK actors for the good guys, a few replacement scenes that are arguably more powerful than in the original, and it completely eliminates the dull cops from the original, as they never show up in any form here--which is good, as they were sort of annoying in the original. It lets us focus on what really matters: The bad guys in disguise, and the good guys who learn they're the people who assaulted, raped, terrorized, and shot their daughter, and are trapped with them with the advantage of surprise. All of this is a good thing.

But then we've got the bad. On its own terms, it lacks the same audaciousness as the first. The obvious one is that our two girls, Mari and her friend, are just nobodies. They have no character, no reason to care about them, and virtually no character development before Mari gets herself trapped. By the time the tension starts, the film fails to give you a reason to care about either of them on any personal level. They're just there, two pretty girls who ended up in a bad spot. But Paige is downright unlikable, and Mari is a sweet little teenage girl, plus something about her brother being dead, or something like that which doesn't really make up for her total lack of character.

In the original, Mari was not a goody-two-shoes sweetheart, and was out for pot just as much as her friend. Both of them are reckless teenagers who naturally feel invincible and so don't mind putting themselves in dangerous situations. You know, the usual kind of teenager that gets in serious trouble because they think bad things happen to other people, not them. Also, Justin here is made to be a saint, albeit a really stupid saint for bringing them to Krug's apartment hoping they don't come back. Nice going, Justin. (When you think about it, the entire movie is completely his fault for enticing them back to his apartment with good intentions gone horribly wrong.) In the original, Justin's character (named Junior then) is a heroin addict who willingly lures the girls back to Krug's apartment with the exact same promise of pot. He does this not because he's a nice guy, but because Krug controls him through heroin fixes. So the trouble starts the wrong way here. It's an accident here due to the moronic good-natured intentions of a stupid kid who happens to have a total psychopath caretaker he simply didn't expect to come back. In the original, all of it was intentional for a heroin fix. It's easy to see why one of these makes a lot more sense than the other. With here, it's stupidity, not an actual trap. It doesn't feel right, and you have to be like, ""Oh, come on."" when Justin has his ""Crap! They're back! How is that possible, when I have every reason to suspect they're coming back and might rape and kill these two girls like the others!?"" face.

The events unfold totally differently here and in a completely different way, so let's get to the important part. Yes, for everyone who was worried they'd leave it out, there's a rape scene with Krug violently tearing Mari apart with his dong. It's pretty long, much longer than the original scene, but it's also a bit muted, and slightly less in the unrated version. Also worth mentioning is that she's mostly uninjured before it begins. In the original, she had already endured an entire night of abuse, is covered in blood, and she's face-to-face with Krug as he's practically drooling all over her face as he's doing his thing. Considering that part of this film was *completely about the rape scene to demonstrate a point*, you may prefer this version, or you may prefer the original's somewhat more brutal, but briefer, scene. Additionally, they stab Paige a few times to kill her, instead of outright dismembering her like the original. The whole thing is really nasty, and of course, Mari dies then after being shot in the head three times after being raped and cut open a few more times.

A remake, I think, should not cut back on the original. So, really, I can't help but think of that as a missed opportunity to really blow away the audience by amping it up even more. There's really no reason they couldn't except for that beautiful R-rating they need, instead of getting knocked up to NC-17.

You know, let's just sum it up as that's the movie's real problem. It *can't* show the same brutality with the same dark humor and off-tone scenes. It's not really the actors' faults, and I especially liked Francis in this replacing Weasel, who comes off as far more threatening and less like just a sadistic idiot.

Oh, and sadly, no chainsaw scene here. Yeah, I know, I would say, ""Huh?"" too. It seemed like a core finisher for the doctor as revenge for her daughter to thrust a chainsaw through his whole body, but they simply screwed it up here. Badly. Not only that, it's been done before. Rather lamely, the doctor uses a broken microwave to fry the guy's head until it explodes. It's not all that interesting, it's been done before, and the doctor never comes off as threatening at any point, or really all that angry like he should be.

So, the original is far darker--but this one has that ""modern"" style which works pretty well, but just isn't the same. They cut back on scenes that would probably put them in NC-17 territory, which would've been no good, and it's just...bleh. The entire point of the film is to demonstrate how dangerous a simple outing in a dangerous neighborhood can be, and what can ultimately end up as a result. This version holds itself back, so that message doesn't really resonate. Mari just wasn't supposed to survive the assault, and it's highly unlikely it would happen here, considering that she gets shot right in the shoulder and yet somehow makes it *all the way back to her house just by swimming*. It's kind of stupid, and there's no one that could do that even if they weren't shot. There's a current. Sure, the distance isn't catastrophically long (they crashed near her house), but she was just raped and freaking shot in the shoulder. She shouldn't even be able to use her arm, much less swim like a champion during a thunderstorm. It cheapens the film and makes it less realistic due to Mari's survival. It doesn't make sense.

On the bright side, if you've never seen the original, you have a far better chance of getting something out of this, since you won't constantly be disappointed by the highly altered sequence of events or the lack of tone the original had, which was just way more effective for its point, since it stayed dead in reality. Here, well, not so much.

As a remake, this is three stars. Add one star if you've never seen the original. And that's that.",1344211200,2,7741,4.577922077922078

I really didn't remember all of the first movie, just one scene that probably will never leave my mind.  It was pretty graphic.

This movie follows the same storyline as the original, but has a few differences (the one scene I mentioned before is not in this one).  I liked the few changes that they made as far as the outcome of the daughter better than the original.

I really thought the acting was great.  Seeing the ""dad"" from Raising Hope and ""Jessie"" from Breaking Bad was a surprise, and they were excellent bad guys.  The mother, father and daughter protagonists are also very good.

This movie is way better than that one, although I'm glad I rented it.  There's no bumbling sheriff in this one with hokey music to confuse audiences as to which genre the movie is.

There is actually somewhat satisfying revenge in this one and the acting is way better.

I don't want to give any spoilers, but there were also vast improvements from the shoddy story of the original.

I'm not sure why it was unrated; there was very little nudity and the rape scene, although portrayed realistically, was pretty tame compared to others I've seen.  The gore wasn't anything too outlandish.  It seems something was left out even though this says unrated version.

The acting is fairly decent, the music, production values and so fourth are all pretty good. Where the film falls very short is that it's not all that horrifying and even the unrated cut has scenes that while certainly disturbing to some degree are few and far between. Most of the revenge sequences run dry and there isn't much delivered that really shocks you. The movie seemed very tame compared to the original or movies like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Hostel or even a movie liike the french zombie flick 'The Horde' which was much bloodier and much more scary, while not being any sort of classic.

If you don't know, Paul is the co-star of what is undeniabley the best tv show in the history of television. However he was completely under-utilized in this film. It seemed he really only had a few lines and a little expansion on his character, simply for an opportunity for him to act, could have added a lot to the movie. The second reason I watched this film was because I am a fan of the original, which I watched after Quentin Tarantino listed it in his top 20 grindhouse films list. If you are a Tarantino fan you know that the bulk of Tarantino films are homages to 70s grindhouse films and it is cool to watch the movies that influenced him. The original won't let you down in this area. My problem with the remake was that it left out all of the scenes that made the original a good film. The most recognizable being that the remake contained no chainsaw, easily the most memorable part of the original. Instead we get a scene with a microwave, which was decent, but I couldn't help feeling completely let down by the fact that there was NO chainsaw anywhere. Also, in the remake, Krugers son does not die. I kept waiting for him to blow his own brains out and it never happened. FAIL!!! That was the most interesting scene of the original by far. Also missing was the absurd comedy provided by the police officers, who in the original hitched a ride on in the back of a truck transporting chickens. There was no comedic relief at all in this one. So basically every aspect of the orginal that made it unique was removed.

A starring cast that includes Tony Goldwin, Monica Potter, Sarah Paxton, Garret Dillahunt , Spencer Trent Clark and Aaron Paul. This movie has what appears to be, the makings of a good flick. However, let me warn you. I will not say this movie is bad, but I will say that I enjoyed very few parts of the movie. Not enough to call it good! The original storyline is a great concept but somehow this movie fell short for me. I caught myself laughing at the utter absurdity of the characters' reasoning, or lack thereof, and some of the death scenes were over the top! I warn you now, if you watch the unrated version of this movie be prepared for a brutal rape scene! All in all, it wasn't terrible, and somehow Wes Craven did what he does best...make me watch the whole movie. I am torn as to whether I liked this movie better on the shelf or in my DVD player, but I am not torn as to whether or not I will watch another Wes Craven flick. Considering the fact that Mr. Craven is the same man who made us afraid to go to sleep with 'A Nightmare on Elm Street', he will always be one of the great directors. Just my opinion. If there is nothing else available to watch on DVD, give this movie a try, however, don't say I didn't warn you!

The difference between this thiller and others in the same vein is that the victims refuse to be victims, but instead fight back for survival.

 Garrett Dillahunt, who plays the crazed maniac, steals the film with his look of rage and his terrifying voice, but all in all the performances are first-rate and the production flawless. The movie itself is a remake of the 1972 film of the same name, but it is far better due to the wonderful production values due to today's movie making.

The origanal gives info about what their crimes were and stuff like that. I actually like the criminals in the first one. I love Jr because he really is just manipulatied by his dad. They make them funny and actually like talk to each other. The part in the hotel where there all hanging out really makes the movie good. They show them bring the girls out the fire escape and put them in the trunk and they don't have them escape so much. Jr compared to Justin, Krugs son in the origanal was a problem for me. He didn't fit the role. Jr in the origanal was a shy drug addicted loser and Justin didn't fit that. Now plot, the plot was the worst thing everything in the origanal was realistic and made sense. In the new one Justin brings them over to his house to do drugs but why?? would he do that if he was living with convicts. He just can't smoke pot by himself? Then they kidnap them because they think they'll tell, but what exactly? They didn't know they were convicts. Then they get in an accident. That wasn't even needed? Then the Paige, the new phyliss, excapes? She barely get's any time then after they catch her they start stripping mari and then they kill Paige because she talked back. The killing sequence for paige isn't even as gory as the original. And you don't care when she dies. I'll admit the rape scene in this one is way worse but it's so bad because it over compensates for the lake of anything else happening. The thing I had a problem with it how Mari survives and they still kill all of them. Why? Just because she got raped by the 1 one guy.

3911123,3,B002DKGWSE,"Any review of this remake by the film's original director is likely to include comparisons to the original. Considering the original budget, that was a better movie, especially for its time.
  The remake changes a few plot aspects and creates a tighter script. The acting is more professional and the video quality is superb in comparison to the first movie. Inexplicably the audio seems actually worse in the new version. Some key lines are swallowed. Despite slightly more modern acting techniques and better overall sets, props, special effects, and cameras, this remake is a poor cousin to the original shocker. Gone are the effects of horror experienced by the girls as well as their marred innocence. As well, the events are curtailed a lot in the remake.  Maybe we don't need to see such nasty detail, but if we saw it in the first movie, we probably wanted to see it again or we would not be watching the new version.
  Any attempt to explain or justify the actions of the killers should be lost on an audience. There is no reason for their behavior and it is ridiculous to try to delve into that aspect. The implausible story seemed almost an aside to the horror and action in the original. In the remake, even the unrated one, it appears the director was attempting to pacify the ratings committee to create a wider appeal for the movie. Unfortunately I am sure that did not happen. I am guessing more people still watch the original than the remake and I would guess most prefer the original to its slicker more modern version.

3911129,4,B002DKGWSE,"It seems that most of the discrepancy here is between those who saw the original and loved it, those who never saw the original, and those who saw the original and hated it. But if we look at this movie as its own entity without comparing it to the original or any other similar films, we are bound to see what these directors/writers were going for which hits on themes introduced by horror film makers of generations ago. This film gives us a safe look at what it's like to a victim by sparing us nothing in the ways of brutality, human apathy and extreme realistic violence that literally ""hits home"" in this depiction. Horror film makers have always liked to test the boundaries of safety and comfort zones to show us that we can all become victims at any time through no fault of our own and this film builds on the viewer's fears that what we are watching could actually happen to us. Isn't that, after all, what good horror films do? They make us uneasy while we face our own mortality and wonder what we would do if we were in the character's situation. I don't think anyone could watch this movie without putting themselves in the place of the teenage girls, the overpowered son of the brutal gang leader, and the parents, all at different times during the course of the film.  When confronted with what has happened to their child, the parents do not go on a vengeance trip but are in fear of their own and their daughter's life when it becomes apparent that her attackers are in their own home. To say this is a revenge flick is untrue and misses the greater point being made. They will do anything it takes, no matter how gruesome or violent, to protect their beloved child. The film could have ended this way with the parents safely escaping with their daughter, leaving the battered bodies of the killers behind them. But the final scene allows viewers to go away from the film pondering the fine line between justice and vengeance and makes us wonder if we ourselves would be able to tell the difference when someone we love has been victimized. I don't believe the microwave scene was a last ditch effort by the writers for a thrill kill. But instead it turns the tables and makes the killer now a victim and the father now a murderer as those lines between vengeance and justice are blurred.

To follow along the lines of most of the other reviewers and compare it with the original which, I suppose, is inevitable, I think the original failed to make this final point and instead went for the sensational gore of the vengeance genre while missing whole-cloth what this movie hammered home hard and successfully. This film recognizes the original intent of the horror genre and gives lovers of these films hope that good horror films can actually still be made.",1279584000,2,2778,4.542914171656687

With the original, you knew that this movie wasn't going to be for everyone.  It's a sick, twisted movie, cheap and ugly but with some appeal to the certain strata of horror fans.

But to remake it...well...you've got to tone it down, clean it up.  This is going to be for kids now.  They're watching stronger stuff but still...okay, have the rape scene but don't show any actual nudity.  The violence?  Stab, shoot and bludgeon away because the kiddies know it's all fake anyway.

That's why I dislike all of these remakes: the ""horror"" is diluted.  Today, it's meant to be entertainment.  There's nothing edgy here.  Just waiting for one character to commit some horrible violence on another.  This would be just a very simple revenge story if it wasn't for that last shot of the father with the leader of the gang.

3911131,5,B002DKGWSE,"For most horror fans, Wes Craven's landmark introduction to cinema The Last House On the Left is one of the most infamous titles in movie history.  The gritty, documentry style movie about the vicious murder of two American teenage girls and the ultimate revenge on their murderers by the parents of one of them is just as real and just as disturbing today as it was back in the 70's.  Now comes the '08 take on the story.

  The story basically remains the same.  Two girls make a mistake of buying weed off a total stranger and are kidnapped by a gang of criminals on the lam.  Over the course of one afternoon, the girls are taken out into the woods where one girl is murdered via a graphic gutting and her friend, Mari, is raped and left for dead.  But then a major storm breaks and the gang has to seek shelter at a nearby house.  To bad for them the house belongs to Mari's parents and that Mari has a strong will to survive.  And once Mari's parents find out the truth about their new houseguests, they will make sure that they regret ever stepping inside their home.

  What can I say that other viewers haven't already stated.  This remake is without a doubt one of the best remakes in this current trend.  It remains faithful to the source material while adding enough of its own twists and turns to make it able to stand up on its own.  The acting is top knotch with kudos going out to Sara Paxton (Aquamarine, ""The Beautiful Life: TBL"") as Mari.  Make no mistake, the movie is hardcore.  It takes no prisoners.  It forces us to watch the events unfold no matter how intense it steadily grows.  The rape (esp. in the UNRATED cut) is graphic and uncomfortable.  And the blood does flow, not as much as in, say, Hostel or Saw, but just enough to make us feel dirty.

  In the end, I would have to say that 2008's The Last House On the Left will no doubt become a classic.  Mr. Craven, himself, says that this new cut is better then his.  My only complaint is with Universal for once again releasing a dvd/blu-ray with basically no extra features.  We get a two or three short deleted scenes that adds nothing to the movie and a misleading featurette ""A Look Inside"" which is only a three minute trailer intercutted with short tidbits by Mr. Craven, Mr. Cunningham, and director Dennis Iliadis.  And for blu-ray fans, you only get ""My Scenes"", ""BD LIVE"", ""D-Box Motion Control"", and the inevitable ""Digital Copy"", you know, standard Universal crap.  How about a commentary or a featurette about how this cult classic came to be remade?  Maybe even the actual trailer?

3911133,5,B002DKGWSE,"I admit I orignally had no interst in seeing this '09 remake of 1972's ""Last House on the Left"", which involved the rape/murder of two girls and the ensuing revenge by the parents of one of the girls (loosely based on Ingmar Bergman's ""The Virgin Spring"" from 1960). Why not? Because the original ""Last House"" was just so dumb. I know many hail it for being ""disturbing"" due to the vile, sadistic villains and the humiliation, rape and gorey murders -- but I didn't find it disturbing at all. Why? Because the preposterous storyline accompanied by the goofy music and bumbling cops made it impossible to take serious. Consequently, just like I don't consider the violence in, say, a Road Runner cartoon disturbing -- because it's impossible to take seriously -- so I didn't find ""Last House"" disturbing. Dumb? Yes. An interesting early 70's curiosity? Yes. Disturbing? No.

Apparently director Dennis Iliadis and writers Adam Alleca & Carl Ellsworth understood the blatant flaws of the original because this remake overcomes them all and is a near masterpiece of filmmaking.

Without knowing what it was, I stumbled upon this remake last weekend while channel-surfing in a motel in the heart of Nebraska; the opening caught my attention and I became engrossed. About an hour into the story it dawned on me that this was the remake of ""Last House on the Left."" Although I couldn't finish the film, the first thing I did when I got home was order the dvd.

What makes this remake so good?

For one thing, the filmmaking itself is top-of-the-line -- the cinematography, music, cast, acting, mood, suspense, etc. all work together to make a superior piece of cinematic art -- yes, even though it's ""just a horror flick.""

I was particularly impressed with the way the film juxtaposes the beauty of nature & people/family with the hideousness of human evil. Take, for example, the opening scenes of the beautiful woods & music followed by the thug's murderous escape and the later sequence where a fleeing girl is shot while swimming through a lake. The film was incidentally shot in Helderberg Nature Preserve, Western Cape, South Africa, of all places. Gorgeous locations, to say the least, and a fine stand-in for somewhere-in-the-sticks, USA.

The character of Justin was another great element. Through no fault of his own he's the teenage son of the main scumbag. It's clear that Justin hates the perverseness and hypocrisy of his ""family life"" and craves normalcy and genuine love. He's in torment but is too afraid of his father to overtly act (and understandably so), but he does what he can, when he can. The message of Justin is that people are not cursed to follow the wicked/foolish ways of their bloodline. Simple wisdom and force of righteous will breaks the curse. Redemption is there, if you want it.

I also liked the way the film depicts the duplicity of the thug gang, particularly the leader Krug (Garret Dillahunt). He's the ultimate POS but watch him cover-up his intrinsic wickedness with his knack for social acclimation -- a fake smile, innocent smalltalk and a well-placed ""Amen."" The film successfully shows how some people aren't what they appear to be; they're the express opposite! Not to mention the flick is a good reminder to always be on your guard. Don't be naive; not everyone's like you or me. Some people will happily abuse, rape and kill without a second thought. They're scum, pure and simple (by their OWN foolish choices). If you have daughters make sure they view this, even though some parts are hard to watch.

Also, the numerous preposterous elements of the original story have been fixed (see my review of the '72 version for details). The family is vacationing in a wilderness area and there's only one town nearby. The daughter successfully steers the criminals close to her home, unbeknownst to them. The thugs aren't dressed-to-the-nines when they show up at the parent's doorstep, not to mention they have a legitimate reason (""There's been an accident"").

The goofy elements of the original -- the silly music and bumbling cops -- have been eliminated altogether. The film has a serious, realistic vibe and therefore the horrific events are taken seriously.

There are a couple of cliched horror aspects I could do without, specifically the scenes involving a garbage disposal and a microwave. They're a bit silly and needlessly stretch the believability. But then it struck me that they're types of universal/divine judgment and justice; so that's cool.

Another aspect that improved upon the original involves one of the victimized girls, but I don't want to give it away.

The theatrical version runs 110 minutes and the unrated version four minutes longer; both versions are featured on the dvd (I haven't seen the unrated version since the theatrical was more than enough for me, if you know what I mean).

FINAL ANALYSIS: This '09 remake of ""Last House on the Left"" is vastly superior in every conceivable way and proves that remakes can and should be made when/if appropriate. In ways it's even a masterpiece, a brilliant showcase of beauty and the beast. Don't miss out just because you thought the original was a POS.",1275782400,4,5174,4.906178489702517
3911134,4,B002DKGWSE,"Warning: This contains plot spoilers essential to the review, but no action details.

Some seem to be disappointed that this version of ""Last House on the Left"" doesn't have the ""raw power"" of the original; I suppose that's true if you define ""raw power"" as meaning that the power to disgust and shock should transcend plot and character.

This version slightly but significantly redeems its use of the movie, Bergman's ""Virgin Spring,"" that is the structural source for both ""Last House"" versions. The essential plot line for all is the same. Young girl encounters bad guys who entrap her, leading to brutal rape and murderous attack. Circumstance leads the attackers to unknowingly seek refuge at the home of her parents, who give them help and shelter. The parents come to realize that something terrible has happened to their daughter and that their ""guests"" are the perpetrators. Merciless revenge from the parents follows.

Wes Craven's first ""Last House"" (first as his hand is also in this one) was interesting in the sense that it packed so much, and such gratuitous, cruelty, humiliation, brutality and shock into one film, making it a key work of its type; but even as far as ""the envelope"" has been pushed in movies in recent years, the first, nearly 40-year-old movie still has the ""raw power"" to make you want to look away at times and feel more than a little dirty from having watched it to the end.

I would not call the new version ""sensitive"" by any means, but it at least restores a sense of plot, some modicum of character development and, while hatefully violent, removes some of the sleaze factor.

The rape scene is important to all three movies, and its handling here says something of its own in the sequel. In ""Virgin Spring"" most of the rape scene was excised after distribution but recently restored. The full scene arouses anger and pity in the viewer and puts a sharp point on the horror and cruelty of the act, not only of the rape of the character, but of rape itself. In the first ""Last House"" the rape and what follows, while still the plot climax, seems more like just another instance of the pandering sleeze that typified the entire movie. In this remake, the rape itself, while still brutal, manages to remove the prurience and peep-show quality, and invites the audience's rage at the act by concentrating on the suffering of the victim.

I thought this version earned a fourth star for its attempts to recast a famous but irredeemable original. I nearly knocked off that star for the very last scene, perhaps a high point for some, but too much a reminder of the tone of the prior movie.",1275091200,,2626,4.710239651416122
3911135,3,B002DKGWSE,"Wes Craven's classic shocker ""The Last House On The Left"" gets a bigger budget, a better cast, and a polished look in this 2009 remake of the same name.  Unfortunately all of these elements do not help the film's overall dull feel.

Fresh-faced Sara Paxton (""Aquamarine,"" ""Sydney White"") portrays Mari Collingwood, a swimming champion and all-around good girl with a slight bad streak (which gets her into trouble) who takes a vacation with her parents, Emma (Monica Potter, ""Con Air"" and ""Boston Legal"") and John (Tony Goldwyn, ""Ghost"" and ""Tarzan"").  Once they arrive at the family lake house , Mari convinces her parents to spend a little time alone while she goes into town to hang out with her friend, Paige (Martha McIsaac, ""SuperBad"").  Mari's parents begin to enjoy their evening together while Mari and Paige decide to follow a stranger named Justin (Spencer Treat Clark, ""Gladiator"") to smoke marijuana.

Once the trio of new friends begin to have fun, Justin's father, Krug (Garrett Dillahunt, ""Deadwood"") shows up along with his girlfriend, Sadie (Riki Lindhome, ""Pulse"") and Francis (Aaron Paul, ""Big Love"" and ""Breaking Bad""), Justin's uncle.  Krug is freshly escaped from prison thanks to Sadie and Francis, and the group have made the headlines in the local newspaper.  Mari lets Krug have her parents' vehicle hoping he'll let her and Paige go.  Not willing to take a chance on  the pair ratting them out, the criminals decide to kidnap them as they stay on the run from the police.

**POTENTIAL SPOILERS**

Mari then tries to trick Krug into driving them by her home and attempts to escape.  This only angers the group (excepting Justin, who never really seems to want to go along with his father's criminal ways) and they commence to torturing and beating the girls in the forest just across the lake from Mari's family lake house.  Despite begging for their lives, Paige is murdered and Mari is raped and left for dead in the lake.

The criminals then find themselves trapped in a storm and unwittingly head for the Collingwood's house in order to seek refuge and to get a little first aid due to their altercation with the girls.  Soon enough, the parents are tipped off that they are harboring their daughter's murderers.  This information drives Emma and John from being a mild-mannered, well-to-do couple into a sinister pair of vengeful parents.

The tide is then turned on the criminals and a series of somewhat brutal and bizarre beatings and killings begin.

**END SPOILERS**

The film's premise of making the criminals the victims (well deserved, in this case) shows you just how dangerous being the bad guy really can be.  Krug, Francis, and Sadie argue with each other, show fear and doubt when faced with exposure, and even fall victim to their own egos at times.  While this makes for an interesting study in human nature and how quickly it can deteriorate in both good and bad people, the film struggles to fully deliver its message.  While I found myself cheering for the parents and hoping for the girls to escape, I never saw the film as more than just another Hollywood remake trying to outdo the original.

While the film is uncomfortable to watch, it isn't so uncomfortable that you'll want to look away or mute the audio.  There is a bit of gore, especially splattering blood, but there have been plenty of other films out there that surpass this film's goriness (including the original).  There's also no real sense of terror or suspense since everything is played out right before your eyes.

I will say that Paxton, Goldwyn, and Dillahunt do excellent jobs with their characters.  I was especially pleased with Paxton's performance, having only seen her portray sugary sweet characters as in ""Aquamarine"" or stereotypical teen snobs in films like ""Sleepover.""  Clark comes off a little too emotional at times and Potter looked as if she was uncomfortable in her role.  Lindhome's somewhat psychotic portrayal of Sadie was good, but she remains a minor player in the film for the most part.  While there's little humor in the film, Paul's tough-guy portrayal of Francis is a bit funny.

Overall, this film is mildy entertaining but doesn't compare to the brutality and rawness of the original.  It just goes to show that a film's ""slickness"" doesn't always add up to a successful picture.  Recommended as a one-time rental.",1273795200,4,4366,4.8965986394557826
3911136,1,B002DKGWSE,"The remake of The Last House on the Left does not deliver. Whatever promise any of you who have not seen it yet believe it holds, I suggest you stay away now. This film is horrible. One thing that irks me to no end is the IMDb rating. How the hell is this rated higher than the original? While the original is by no means a great film, it is still a horror classic.

I wonder what anyone could see in this.

The original was a remake of Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring, and explored the concept of revenge: a young girl is murdered and when the murderers stop by the parents' home to spend the night not knowing that they've killed their daughter, the parents take action and dispatch those who killed their child.

Sounds brutal, doesn't it? The main difference is that the original tackled the topic almost perfectly. This one just goes way off the mark. While the original was a masterpiece in exploitation (and had excellent performances by the actors who played the criminals and sported some nasty rape and torture sequences that served to make Wes Craven a household name), the remake is just a trashy wannabe of a film that does not even graze the achievements of its predecessor. I'd say one should stick to the Bergman and the Craven editions overall. There was a light rehash on this material named Chaos, but that one was a failure on all levels.

This one is just sad.

A waste of talent on all levels (not even Monica Potter and Tony Goldwyn, whom I both like could save it) and there's something more disturbing about the annoying Sara Paxton playing their daughter (who survives, unfortunately--unnecessary change) that is more disturbing than the actual rape and torture sequences, which I found laughable.

I find it funny how anyone could label this ""anti-human,"" as some reviewers of the film did.

It's not. It's just a pathetic attempt at money. The blood and guts aren't even enough to satisfy gorehounds, and whatever great things anyone has heard of the ending, discredit them.

And what ruins the whole movie is a terrible, way too long rape scene that was inserted apparently to only piss off everyone. And I am never bothered by rape scenes; this one was way too much.
Then the revenge parts are very underwhelming. In the original movie, the parents went to very different lengths to put down the villians. Instead, this time they basically become the villians and/or slasher killers. While you don't feel that they did anything wrong, it didn't work as a whole.

The material is based on Ingmar Bergman's THE VIRGIN SPRING. That film has strong spiritual undertones that justify the ugly scenes that we have to endure, so that we may see the bigger picture of redemption at the end. In the context of THE VIRGIN SPRING, the graphic nature of the rape is necessary. As it is presented in THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, it is nothing more than pure exploitation that ultimately does not lead to anything that would warrant such a scene. The overall effect of that disgusting, perverse, gratuitous rape scene pervades the rest of the film, and in the end there is no real pay off. Yes, we want the parents to have revenge. I was rooting for mom and dad all the way. However, it was only after that I had finished the film that I questioned everything that I had seen. Gone was the moral center that made THE VIRGIN SPRING such a powerful experience to sit through. In Bergman's film, God's grace and forgiveness intersect through the darkness. The film ends with a natural miracle. The film ends with forgiveness. This one does not. This one ends with a man's head exploding in a microwave.

The last House on the Left was recommended by a friend of mine stating it's a good horror film. Once I read the portrayal of the movie I thought it sounded interesting (you can't go wrong with psychopathic killers) and rented it through my local blockbuster.

First of all, it is a horror film but not something that I have encountered before. Where the film portrays occurrences that unfortunately do exist in this world there are scenes that are just too much to bear or witness. The psychopathic murderers look as normal as any human being -they are not represented by the usual psychos looks like in other movies- yet inside they are full of evil and wickedness.  What made this movie shocking and disturbing was the two specific scenes that I'm sure would have made the whole world talk about if it had done well in the box office; the rape and the stabbing sight.

The rape panorama was indeed very gruesome and grotesque especially when it's to a very young girl by an adult male (one of the psychos). It didn't cut filming in order to give you the idea of what was going on; the movie actually films the whole thing without interruption. You can't get any more realistic then that.  Very intense and disturbing!  The other scene where the other young girl gets stabbed looked as well very sensible. I'm sure you'll clutch on to something when you're watching it.  The acting in the movie and the excellent interpretation of all characters added the touch to make it look even more realistic.  Not for the faint of heart and I'm sure this will make many people stop viewing the film after such incidents.

Horror? Yes! Thriller? Even more! After the events mentioned above the movie will kick in taking you for a ride of vengeance and reprisal by one of the girl's parents. It is a great thriller mixed with horrific scenes but if you're strong enough you'll be able to surpass it.",1267228800,,1918,4.60117302052786

This is a remake to one of the most notorious horror films of the `70s. Notorious because of the various prints that floated around (some showed more than others), notorious because of the sexual degradation and violence in an R rated movie (originally meant to be an adult film, they decided to go with an R rating to make more money on the drive-in circuit). And notorious for its frequent tonal shifts - black comedy/sadistic violence/slapstick comedy/sexual humiliation.

This remake takes the safe route, and all but sanitizes the sexual humiliation scenes and the brutality of the murders. Yes, what remains will shock to a degree, but not to the degree of the original.

Here are some changes (mostly politically correct crap that has overtaken contemporary horror films):

'72: Krug's son lures the girls to the lair so Krug and company can ""have some fun"", and in perhaps the most disturbing scene in the film, Krug's son briefly retaliates by pointing the gun at him, but Krug has so much control over him (by hooking him on heroin), he tells him to kill himself, and he obliges.

'09: Krug's son is a stereotypic pothead/victim who innocently invites the girls back to smoke, thinking Krug won't come back until later, and actively helps out the family towards the end.

'72: the girls are typical teenagers of the time who smoke.

'09: Mari's friend smokes, Mari evidently does not (coughing when she takes a hit), and this relegates the film to the current morality tale of pot smoking=death; see ""Chainsaw"" `03 when Biel expresses disgust over their trip to get pot, then flicks a joint out of the window when offered one, and ""Friday the 13th"" `09 that has pothead dolts getting killed by Jason.

'72: Mari is shot, manages to crawl out of the lake, and is found dead. Realistic and devastating.

'09: Mari is shot, and manages to swim, then crawl out of the lake and to the house in a rainstorm that is described as so bad, even a tow truck won't come out - politically correct nonsense to the extreme. And I'm sorry, but foreshadowing this by showing her holding her breath under water at the beginning doesn't cut it.

`72: The killers are depicted as ""animal-like"" (Sadie), killers of a priest and two nuns (Krug), and sadistic child molestors (Weasel).

'09: Sadie has a mascara tear fall from her eye when Mari is shot, and Weasel is neutered by being renamed ""Francis"" and cries like a baby when his broken nose is fixed. Contrast his crybaby behavior with Mari's stoic silence when her father stabs her in the back twice to treat her. And Krug is just another typical killer/rapist that could have been in any crime-themed TV show or movie.

'72: The family is sympathetic in their revenge for their dead daughter.

`09: The family is initially sympathetic in their revenge for their *still living* daughter, but sympathy turns to incredulity during the final scene that shows the father becoming Dr. Butcher M.D. when he kills Krug in a set piece taken directly from an obscure slasher film called ""Evil Laugh"". This scene could have worked if it was a nightmare scene (like the chisel nightmare from ""Last House"" '72) but it does not work in the context of a real scenario, but instead lowers it to the level of a stupid `80s slasher film, like one called ""Evil Laugh"".

This is a well made film. And I appreciate that a lot of the original cheese was removed.  The rape scene was appalling and unless I just supressed the memory of the first film, it's much worse.  Given the horror of what Mary endures, I didn't feel like the kill/revenge scenes were as satisfying as the original. I felt the parents often bumbled around and made a lot of clich horror movie mistakes.  It's definitely an intense movie that keeps you on the edge of the seat, but I also heard myself screamng ""OH COME ON!"" an awful lot.

I don't wanna start this whole Vigilante discussion but the film gives the best excuse.
The Movie itself is perfectly made, i find it even better in some scenes most of all the family situaton. Goldwyn and Potter are truly believable and Dillahunt as Krug is abolutely first grade.
The DVD itself has good transfer, the sound is ok, the extras are some deleted scenes and a small doc.

Almost like watching Faces of Death or something.  Really creepy and just evil.  I wouldn't watch it again alone or in the wrong frame of mind.  This remake barely evokes anything close to that.

Both movies involve scenes of rape and torture, but I think mothers day doesn't take it too seriously and that is what makes it more watchable. I haven't seen the '72 version so I can't compare these two films. Also the only person I think that would enjoy the rape scenes are someone like Ted Bundy or the Hillside Stranglers. I guess they get the intended reaction in making you want to go beat every rapist in the world with a ball bat until their eyeballs pop out so I guess the director and writer can be commended for this powerful involving horror fest.",1254268800,,795,4.342281879194631
3911167,4,B002DKGWSE,"I think often times many people are so critical of movies they don't find most movies enjoyable.  As in this case with ""Last House On The Left"", I agree with some of the faults, but think those who criticize are losing sight of the powerful story behind this movie.

Violence is a reality unfortunately and many families and individuals are subjected to home invasions, robberies, attempted murders, and worse.  Of course our reaction if we can retain courage is to defend ourselves.  HOWEVER, what intensifies such a situation even more is having your child a victim of crime and realizing the person/persons involved are in your guest house right next door! That very thought is horrifying.

As here we go with ""Last House On the Left"". Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter are outstanding as the grief stricken parents who come to terms that their daughter's attackers are within their presence and they must do what they have to do to get their daughter medical attention. The tension at times in the film was breathtaking, especially when Monica's character realizes the truth about their visitors and she must converse with one in her kitchen with her injured daughter laying in the next room. Wow,
powerful!  Kudos to Monica for her sincere portrayal.

While some criticize that there wasn't much emotional progression in the movie between Tony and Monica's characters from the first killing to the continuing attempts. In a realistic situation like that, there's not a lot of time to think! I think at key points in the movie, their looks into each other's eyes said it all. Yes, they could have tried to make a getaway in the boat without confrontation or violence, but at the risk of the criminals catching on or finding their daughter?  Primal instincts of protection of their children and survival instincts kicked in.

As for the bloody violence, the ""first evil one to go down"" scene could have been done without the garbage disposal, that almost pushed the scene over the top.  And a MAJOR agreement I have is the final microwave scene.  I'll leave it at that.  The parting shot at the lake would have made me give an extra star had it ended there, but if I watch it again, it'll be on DVD where I can press the forward button at the ending lake scene and go right to the ending credits.

I do agree the rape scene is horrific and disturbing. However, I do understand the use of that scene as from that point on, I wanted to see the evil get their due. Kudos to the director for making Mary and Paige (played effectively by those actresses too) for not being helpless victims.  Every chance they got they fought to get away.  Good for them.

I would like to commend the director for inserting a sympathetic character into the evil victimizing group.  That served as atleast somewhat of a balance so the evil didn't wholly envelop the film.

In closing, we all have opinions about movies and the right to express them.  I try to be as open minded as possible in seeing what the point of a movie is and what I can get out of it.  This one clearly said DON'T MESS WITH MY DAUGHTER OR ELSE!  I have to respect that. I know there are others who saw this movie who agree.
For those who don't, you have that right.  I also don't know if I'll watch it again, but I'm glad I did see it.

Sincerely,
William",1254182400,,3306,4.55668358714044

While there is the death scenes that occur after the parents find out the ppl staying in their guest house attacked their daughter, I wouldn't really say this is a horror film in the way one tends to think of them. To me it's more of a human emotional drama but to each their own.

And while you want to cheer the parents on for getting their revenge, you never feel that justice had been done.

All in all, it is a good movie and worth seeing if you're the type of person who can handle watching these kinds of scenes.",1253664000,2,914,3.9836065573770494

3911171,4,B002DKGWSE,"I don't know how many horror remakes and movies I've seen made in the past 6 or so years but someone needs to tell these people how to make a scary movie. I mean, there's nothing wrong with gritty atmosphere and tension but if you're just trying to pass off gore as ""this'll make the audience lose sleep at night"" and call it a day well they're wrong. So looking at the Saw films, Hostel films, remakes of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Friday the 13th or stuff like Black Christmas and My Bloody Valentine 3D are coming by the truckloads to the theatres (and strangely leaving just as quickly), in comes another horror remake with the ""Last House on the Left"" and I remember just before putting down the cash to check it out I thought ""ugh, this better not be the same thing over and over again"", well surprisingly it wasn't and it was shockingly good. Not in my opinion enough to buy, slight bare-bones release aside, but considering what we normally have to put up with, this is an improvement.

The Collingwood family are headed on vacation to their summer home when daughter Mari decides to borrow the car, head into town and visit friend Paige. When a weird kid named Justin says he can get them some good marijuana provided they let him buy cigarettes, Mari reluctantly goes along to Justin's motel room and relax. Only none of them expected to be visited by Justin's dad Krug, girlfriend Sadie and a bit ""off"" Francis with Krug having just escaped police custody. Not wanting to let them leave, the whole ordeal will end with Paige dead and Mari raped and supposedly dead too. A violent storm comes in and Krug and company decide to take shelter...at the Collingwood family home and it won't be long until either the Collingwoods or the visitor realizes just who exactly the other party is.

This remake does one thing right that most other remakes don't is that it puts on emphasis on the nature and unflinching visuals of the film and not simply relying on gore. Now keep in mind this movie isn't deprived of more violent stuff but this film is relatively tamer to other horror films recently and a lot of simple actions by characters, though like I said tamer than most, are more effective by just how realistic they are. The centerpiece of course, for lack of a better word, is the rape scene which is even more prolonged in the unrated version of the film and its here where the film disturbs with not only what happens to Mari but also to her friend Paige and kudos for the actress Martha MacIsaac from taking the typical ""best friend who gets offed"" role and actually making one sad and disturbed to see her go. However the one misstep and it's the one a lot of critics noted is the ending scene which feels and plays out like one of those weird codas where the movie could've ended here and be done only there's this additional scene and you're putting down the remote going ""oh, there's more?"" It's the goriest moment in the whole film yet the outlandish act of it kind of ruins it.

As far as the roles are concerned, everyone pulls their own weight and this isn't one of those kind of films where one or two characters are above normal while the rest are one-note with each one providing an actual character and the best of these are Garret Dillahunt as Krug, Tony Goldwyn as the dad and Monica Potter as the mom and both of the latter 2 should also get mention since they do enact their revenge and in particularly violent ways yet that whole feeling of ""my god, look what we're doing"" never shakes. Dillahunt I guess is so good at being particularly loathesome which'll probably explain why the ending scene was in because as we know we love to see villains get their comeuppance and I'm sure nobody really liked the one they went with.

Is it a movie worth buying? Not really considering its barebones features even for a Blu-ray and as a movie it's one of those kind where you'll probably like it but it won't have that lingering effect where a month down the line you'll go ""think I wanna watch that again"". Then again, better than what's been coming down the pipeline lately.",1253404800,,4101,4.493297587131368
3911172,1,B002DKGWSE,"Admittedly the camera work, the acting, the cast, and perhaps even the directing have the original beat by miles. This isn't the product of a first time director and crew working out of pocket to make what could be considered a landmark film in the genre, perhaps even creating the genre. This is a more reasonably budgeted Hollywood film with an experienced director, cast and film crew. But after that it falls flat in comparison to the original in just about every way imaginable. Since this film never had a hope of having the same shock impact the 1972 original had on audiences of the day it never even tries. The story is slightly altered, the characters generally are younger, and perhaps less insane, it streamlines a lot of things, we have less time to get to know the Collingwood's and Krug and his people before the action starts. While the bad guys get theirs and deservedly, for the most part the actually moments of revenge are tamer than the original, Francis's death in the original is a classic moment of shock that should have every guy in the audience wincing, and while his death in the remake is suitably unpleasant it never comes close. The only point in which the remake might be considered to surpass the original happens in the last minute and a half or so, a scene well hinted at in the trailers and commercials, showing Krug's fate. But even then it might not be as satisfying as the original. One admitted improvement in the remake is the complete removal of the ineffectual comedy relief police who are stumbling around trying to solve a crime they are barely even aware of. But ultimately this is a pretty mediocre copy of the original, and it has been done so much better in other films, including the original. The film Otis handles the same basic concept with a blackly humorous take that shows the true horror of the original far better than this film does. The unrated edition is also one of the biggest let downs ever, there's maybe 30 seconds of additional film. There's almost no difference at all to the two most graphic and shocking scenes in the film. This film will work best for people who haven't seen the original, in which case I'd give it a three star rating, but having seen the original and understood some of how it would have played to its original audiences this remake comes across as pretty pale. There's also no real extras to speak of, a 2 minute making of that does next to nothing except show Wes Craven giving his approval to a remake, and a couple deleted scenes.",1253404800,4,2524,4.5739514348785875

3911177,3,B002DKGWSE,"Though this reworking of 1972's Last House on the Left-- that itself was a reinterpretation of Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring-- may not quite reach the emotional impact and terror that Wes Craven's original unsettlingly achieved, this reimagining (for once that term has real modern justification) is perhaps the best version that could have been done by a major Hollywood studio for such a film of this narrative nature. As although the original is a fine example of underground novice filmmaking that won over a cult audience in grindhouses and on video, the 2009 version that hit major multiplexes in wide release adds its own unique take on the same story.

The original was about the rape and murder of two girls by a group of viscous convicts on-the-lamb is still the main facet of this remake's story... with a twist thrown in concerning the fate of one of the girls. The last block remains essentially the same too: the convicts end up at one of the girls parents' homes. The adults soon find out about who there guests are and take it upon themselves to get revenge.

Both films have a simplistic plot. Yet, where the original relied on contrivances to get its plot going, the 2009 version makes logical reasons for these strokes-of-luck and oftentimes the storytelling, if sometimes feels Hollywoodized, is much more natural and organic, that is, at least until the tacked on shock ending.

The film, even if it runs much longer, at nearly 2 hours still feels lean-and-mean. There are no scenes of policeman buffoonery like in the original and this 2009 white-knuckle version feels more like a work of an auteur than an amateur. However, the original still has a few major advantages over this remake.

Since the original was very low budget, and was directed somewhat pedestrian, its documentary style approach added both a sense of realism and sleaze to that shocker. In that way it made the film have a captivating, snuff quality to it that added to its take-no-prisoners approach and made it downright disturbing.

Also, unlike the original, the 2009 version uses a big budget, and even if its director Dennis Iliadis has a great visual eye, he does not create that much fear even in the most ghastly scenes. Instead, the film feels more like an action picture, and due to its polish, it just does not have a kind of diabolical, dread-ridden atmosphere. Also, not even the most conservative right should really question the moral frame of mind he was in for making this picture. While Craven and Cunningham's venture took more of a nihilistic tone and defeatist approach that one almost could picture certain moral police groups think of them as sadists.

Moreover, in this 2009 version the villains are much more clean-cut looking and not as memorable. One must ask if one can one really find a better psycho than David Hess as the original's Krug? Probably not. Hess brought an aggressive intensity to his role that made him one of the most intimidating and scariest antagonists in all of film. Garret Dillahunt who plays Krug in the remake may do a good job, but it is not a particularly captivating one.

For that matter, really none of the cast in the remake leaves much of an impression. The cast is capable and natural, yes. Yet, despite an added half hour of character interaction, the cast just does not take it a step further with their parts. Thus making the 2009 film completely Iliadis' show.

When the credits role, one wants more Hollywood horror remakes to follow in this films footsteps. The film is much better than expected, especially given the subject matter. Yet, it also shows a horror fan something they have always known: the best go-for the-jugular fright pictures are always made underground and out of the system.

3911178,3,B002DKGWSE,"THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT

I remember watching the original film and thinking this is a pretty good movie, in fact Wes Craven's 70's classic is still a good film to this day. So when I heard that once again not only was Hollywood remaking an old classic but it would be another Wes film I was a little upset. Of course the remake of his other classic ""The Hills Have Eyes"" was actually good so I finally found myself giving this a chance. The result is kinda mixed for me because this is not horrible in any way but it does not leave me feeling like I watched something classic either.

The Collingwood's are a typical family with a slightly over protective mother who is constantly worried any time the daughter wants to go do something, a typical teen who would rather hang out with her friends and not her parents, and of course the easy going father who is wrapped around the finger of his daughter. It is your average family who are going to their house out in the woods for a vacation I guess, just another day. Mari [daughter] once there immediately wants to use the car to leave and go see her friend who works in town. Emma [mother] wants her to stay and have the family moments but John [father] just throws his little girl the keys and tells her to have fun after giving her some cash.

The day is fine until Mari and best friend Paige go off with a young man named Justin to smoke a little of that sticky. The attraction is there between the teens [as usual, oh those hormones] so of course the girls want to make him over and play dress up with him. Only thing is his family who just walked in are crazy and have no problem killing any one at all. So the film goes into crazy mode and we witness the beating, rape and death of these girls, actually one dies and one is raped. As stated earlier in the film a storm is coming and after doing what they do the killers seek refuge at the closest place possible, at the ""Last House on The Left"" [da da daaa]. It just so happens that this is Mari's house were her parents offer to help these people, until Mari returns home.

This remake is actually good and while not as memorable as the original still manages to pull off some good moments. The film looks good as most remakes do these days but that takes away the gritty feel of the classics. The writing is decent for this type of film and other than the last scene you could see these things happening and they feel real enough. Adam Alleca and Carl Ellsworth did an ok job as far as the script is concerned and director Dennis Iliadis did a good job making the film flow, and the rape scene was very well done. He made it real enough and uneasy enough and at the same time did not over do it taking it into a porn realm. Writer/director of the original Wes Craven returns as a producer and Sean S. Cunningham of ""Friday The 13th"" fame also comes aboard as a producer.

I think the best thing this film has going for it is actually the acting, the leads of this do a great job especially compared to acting in films like this one. Tony Goldwyn who plays John Collingwood does a good job in this film but it is his wife played by Monica Potter who does one of the best jobs on the film. Sara Paxton who played Mari is surprisingly good in this film, I say that because usually whoever plays the young pretty teen in these flicks is usually only cast because of looks. Also Spencer Treat Clark is really good in this film as the only sympathetic character from the group of killers Justin. It is easy to see that he wants nothing to with his family or what they do but he is scared of his father and uncle so much that he can't stand up to them. Aaron Paul who plays his uncle Francis as well is good in this but it is Francis's brother/Justin's father Krug who steals the show. Krug played by Garret Dillahunt is an evil guy who is basically heartless and Garret does an excellent job portraying him in this film.

This film is not a classic at least in my mind but it is good enough for a rental for the most part, maybe even purchase if found at a cheaper price. Other than a few miss steps like the microwave thing which seemed out of place here and
Riki Lindhome's topless over acting [I guess only one of those is bad] as Sadie this is a good remake. For those who have not seen this yet I recommend it, if you like these types of films this is a good choice at the movie store.",1252800000,,4395,4.182998819362456

While remakes are very common nowadays, this subject matter is not typical for mainstream American cinemas. So, the two questions are; is it a good remake? And is it a good film itself? Well, I'll get to that...First, a synopsis:

The film opens with Krug (Garrett Dillahunt) being taken to prison by two police officers. Soon, Krug's brother Francis (Aaron Paul) and girlfriend Sadie (Riki Lindhome) have freed him and we get a brief glimpse of his depravity.

Next, we meet John (Tony Goldwyn), Emma (Monica Potter), and their daughter Mari (Sara Paxton). Staying at their lake house, they allow Mari to go into town and visit her friend Paige. The girls encounter Justin (Spencer Treat Clark), Krug's son, whom they accompany to his motel room to smoke pot. Soon, Krug and his gang burst in on them.

The rest is something you likely already know and it's quite unpleasant. Despite the familiarity most anyone has with the plot of this film, it's not a strict re-creation of the original.

Justin is immediately a more sympathetic character than he was in the original and the torturing of the two girls is considerably shorter and less disturbing than it was in the original.

This brings me to the rape scene, which is shockingly tame considering what a director like Eli Roth would've done with it. It's not exploitative and I applaud director Dennis Iliadis for opting to show the horrific nature of the crime rather than use it for mere shock value.

More on changes; the grainy, raw look of the original has been replaced by a brighter, glossier look which actually works for setting up the horror that's to come.

I haven't seen the original in many years, but I recall not being very impressed by the performances. That is not the case here. Dillahunt as Krug is appropriately menacing and believable and, overall, gives one of the better performances I've seen in a horror film. Goldwyn and Potter too are noteworthy, with the weakest link being Lindhome (as Sadie).

As a horror film, I certainly admire this remake for building genuine tension and suspense. It avoids cheap scare tactics, as well as campy humor (there are no bumbling policemen to be found here). Furthermore, if you're a fan of this genre, you should be impressed. While the first half relies on tension and atmosphere, the second-half is a blood-splattered revenge movie. But, there's also a good deal of characterization here as the parents are fully fleshed-out and human. These are not horror film cliches whom you feel nothing for, which makes this rise above many other horror films.

The final scene of the movie has been called ""ludicrous"" and, yes, it's not very logical. It does, however, show that Krug and his gang aren't the only ones capable of depravity. It's this scene that makes the film a horror/revenge movie rather than a character study/morality tale. What have we learned? What is the message? Has good triumphed over evil? Has justice been done? Is this sort of retribution justified?

The Last House on the Left could have been much more than it is, but the filmmakers took a more traditional route. While, I find this disappointing; on it's own merit, it's a well-made movie. It's not pleasant, but it's one of the better horror remakes I've seen and a pretty effective horror film itself.

When the gang members are trought with them, one of the girl's parents find out what happened and they take revenge on them.

The only differences between this new version and the original is that the acting is better, the budget is higher, it's more suspenseful, more darker, and more realistic. Of course, the rape scene is not so intense as the 70's version.

We have to understand that the 70's version was more like a cheap sexual violent film explotation. The movie only focused on the BRUTAL VIOLENT rape and revenge scenes, so I understand that what Wes Craven was trying to do was to get the public's attention for the first time with a controversial film.

Every now and then I see a film outside of my usual respected circle; but being a movie fan, I can watch with an open mind (or at least try to). As a remake this version of The Last House On The Left gives the impression of a horror at first glance, but is in fact a taunt thriller with intense scenes of violence, rape and drug use; in a broad perspective however, this movie has a twist that makes it strangely intelligent. Some of the scenes may be hard to watch for viewers with a weak propensity for gore, but for a change this film gives the violence a purpose; it speaks to our inner barbarism and dares us to ask, ""What would I do if...?"" Usually, I'd be the last person to recommend a film of this nature to a younger, teen viewer, but if you should happen to have a premiscuous son or daughter who thinks that there's nothing wrong with flirting with a stranger or getting into a car with a someone just because he or she is cute well, this movie could be the ""wake up call"" they've been missing.

Teenagers should have seen enough of these films to catch a hint, but to those elect few who wouldn't know danger from a picnic with Mickey Mouse or who (for whatever reason) are living only ""in the now"" as I call it, this film lays it out in an easy-to-understand reminder why you shouldn't talk to strangers (duh!).

3911190,4,B002DKGWSE,"This is a remake of the Wes Craven's low budget 1972 cult favorite of the same name. I saw the original, and despite its low budget values,  replete with grainy film images and bad acting, it was one of the most horrifying and brutal films that I had ever seen. Of course, the reality is that the crimes that were perpetrated in that film were just that, and, consequently, it remains one of the most frightening and shocking films to date. It was truly chilling. When I saw that there had been a remake, I would curious to see how it would compare. I would have to say that in the shock and awe department, the original still holds sway. Still, the remake is an excellent film and, though brutal, somehow less frightening.

The storyline is every parent's worse nightmare. A teenager, Mari Collingwood, goes with her parents to their rural country house. She takes the family car to meet a friend in town.  Unbeknownst to them, an escaped killer named Krug is on the loose with his rescuers. Mari and her friend hook up with a creepy but cute guy with whom they end up smoking weed with in his motel room. Then his father, his crazy girl-friend, and his uncle show up, and all hell breaks loose. They are none other than the escaped killer and his rescuers.  Clearly, they are not going to let these two girls walk away. What happens next will chill the viewer.

This gritty and raw film has excellent production values, good cinematography, and the cast is a definite an improvement over that in the original. The controversial rape scene is brutal but probably mirrors the reality of such a crime, and the reality of it ain't pretty. Garret Dillahunt is definitely a standout as the ruthless escaped killer. Likewise Tony Goldwyn, Monica Potter, and Sarah Paxton are also excellent as the beleaguered Collingwood family. Overall, it is a remake that stands up well to the original, as well as on its own merits. Although the film is very similar to the original, there are some differences, though in the long run, these differences do not really make or break this film of a family fighting to survive under circumstances most of us would prefer not to think about.

The original was based on Igmar Bergman's swedish arthouse film ""The Virgin Spring"" but this one was a vast improvement on the badly acted yet comical at times 1972 version as this movie was serious without a bit of humor.

3911197,3,B002DKGWSE,"Perhaps I should have re-watched the original ""The Last House on the Left"" before I saw this re-imagining of the violently, brutal horror classic, but I think I can remember enough to write a balanced review. The original had that unrelenting graphically violent nature that is rooted around the premise of the lost of innocence, that left its mark 37 or so years ago. Wes Craven was still trying to find his style during the time, and now, he has been trying to revamp his past brainchild such as ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and even has a remake of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" in the works. This remake, while not as exploitive and stomach-turning as the original, is a decent entry in the books of horror.

Reeling from the death of their son, Ben, the Collingwoods made up of John (Tony Goldwyn), Emma (Monica Potter), and swimmer daughter Mari (Sara Paxton) decide to go up to their lake house for a little renewal and ""family bonding"". 17-year old daughter Mari, however, has her different idea of fun as she hooks up with her friend Paige (Martha MacIsaac) that ends up with the two meeting up with a young man named Justin (Spencer Treat Clark) in a small motel. It turns out Justin is the son of a recently escaped convict named Krug (Garret Dillahunt), who along with his wicked girlfriend Sadie (Riki Lindhome), and Francis (Aaron Paul) plan to get out of dodge as soon as possible. Things turn for the worst as Mari and Paige is taken hostage and something truly horrific happens. Later on, Krug and his crew find themselves stranded and they seek refuge in the last house on the left...the very house owned by Mari's parents.

Directed by Dennis Iliadis, this re-imagining captures the main premise of the 70's original with some small and some major differences in the screenplay. While the original was utterly violent and exploitive; it was a fine product of the times unleashed to an unprepared audience much like ""I Spit on Your Grave"" which gave it an image/title of ""exploitation classic"", this new remake does try to give certain more fleshed out aspects; such as morality and vengeance, as well as a cautionary tale for teenagers. I find bloody vengeance films a lot of fun to watch, and ""The Last House on the Left"" is all about set ups, as we see destiny plays its hand in order to mess with both our good guys and bad guys.

While the original was quick and painful, this remake decides to take its time. The film tries to transcend the usual horror clichs, overload of special effects and torture sequences in favor of subtle characterization and careful composition in its storytelling. The raw intensity of the original is lost, and what we see in its place is some subtle tricks in its photography that meanders and dwells on some emotion as we become privy to Mari's ordeal. Director Iliadis tries to lean towards artistry in place of raw brutality--don't get me wrong, the film is pretty brutal, it just follows a different approach. This remake is also less sadistic than the original, but it does definitely generate more sympathy through characterization rather than through its horrific scenes with grand displays of anger and rage. The brutality represented in the original was pure unrelenting violence that displays humanity's sadistic side; it may prove a bit surreal that may distance some viewers from its emotions. The rape scene in the film is as disturbing and savage as in the original with no touches of crude humor. (No inept cops)

What is also interesting is the fact that Krug and his crew are brutal but they are brutal when provoked; it feels like they were just doing the brutal deeds out of necessity of the situation. When Mari and Paige tried to escape, their reaction is violent, and without regret. I'm still certain that the two would still be killed after all is said and done; but the script does try to bring some questions as to what would have happened if they just cooperated? However, the direction and screenplay gives no room to feel some sympathy towards Krug and his crew; they are vile, evil and despicable. They really deserved what is coming for them, which allows for the viewer to root for John and Emma all the way. The only one worthy of sympathy would be our mislead character Justin, and not entirely by much. The antagonists this time around are no mere caricatures and they feel a little more real. Krug is presented as a lethal, calculating bad guy who may have just left the Collingwoods after a night's rest, despite the temptations of their baser killer instincts but then again, you`d never know since Francis is somewhat taken by pretty Emma.

Purists are bound to be a little upset as even the trailers have shown Mari surviving the rape and while I do somewhat agree with their complaints, Mari's death proved to be the major catalyst for the parents' lust for brutal revenge, this time around the script tries to incorporate a different reason for Emma and John to take the offensive. They have to fight for their barely alive daughter's survival, so they have the added motivation to lay waste upon Krug and his crew of despicable characters. Clues as to how they discover that they were the offenders that attacked their daughter are also handled well. I also enjoyed the scenes when the killing becomes easier for Emma and John after their first kill--all they became concerned about is getting their daughter to safety and woe unto anyone who would stand on their way.

Now this remake isn't perfect. I did not like the last scene in the film's end. I thought it was a little tasteless and pointless left as a cheap device to satisfy lovers of blood and gore. That microwave bit just didn't match the tone of the rest of the film. Also, some scenes may leave some viewers scratching their heads, that some scenes felt too convenient. (I found it a bit hard to believe that Krug's crew didn't leave a `sentry') This unrated edition of ""Last House on the Left"" is 4 minutes longer. I read that the rape scene is longer, no so much as more violent but the camera lingers more to generate the effects of Mari`s attack, which proved more unnerving than the theatrical release. There are some extended scenes of shattered necks and stabbing to satisfy fans.

More methodical with characterization and a bit more `artsy', this remake stands as one of the best horror remakes of an American film. Rampaging parents in the quest for revenge who become cold-hearted killers is pure fun, and it sure helps when the victims are ugly, unsympathetic bad guys. Iliadis took the film's main premise and made it his own. No, it isn't better than the original, but it's almost like Rocky Road and Chocolate Brownie ice cream--both chocolate, but different flavor. It is a different film that can stand on its own.

3911198,5,B002DKGWSE,This is one of the best remakes i've ever seen of horror remakes. Words cannot explain how awesome this movie is. This version kills Wes Craven's original. I think it's 1000 times more intense. All I can say it watch it and judge for yourself. I loved it. When I got through watching it I wanted to hit play again and watch it again.,1250640000,,333,4.21875
3911199,4,B002DKGWSE,"I read a few of the reviews and by the sound of them, I thought this would be a movie that I'd have to cover my eyes and fast forward a lot through. I can't watch films like what I imagine SAW would be like. Those kinds of films can stain the brain.

I watched this because one person said it wasn't as horrific as all that. I didn't have to blink, fast forward or so much as turn my head. There are bad things that happen, but I would not call this an ""over the top"" gore movie. Yes, people get stabbed, poked, and otherwise beaten. But as one reviewer put it, it actually works well. It's merely part of the film and not for the sake of spreading blood all over the place in some teen-ager slasher film. It works here.

Now that I've seen it I can tell you there are far worse films that will get into your head and make you want to watch a cartoon after words to clear your mind. This isn't one of those. I watched it in the dark and I'm not going to have any trouble sleeping tonight at all.",1250553600,,995,3.97

anyways I recommend this movie if you liked movies like death sentence,man on fire boondock saints or the brave one. if not, i think you can still watch it just to criticize those who tend to let the animal instincts prevail over their reasoning.",1250467200,2,917,4.215909090909091

3911202,2,B002DKGWSE,"Since there seems to be a shortage of New story ideas, Remake seems to be the best option..either remake an old classic or simply lift from some foregin film!!
having said that, most of the recent remakes seem to be a BAD version of the original. Where the movie should have been more slick, the music richer, the cinematography superior (given the advancement in technology) even the plot & ending could have been made more interesting & New.
BUT that is not so..INSTEAD we get MORE Gore, Blood, Nudity & absolutely no thrill or suspense whatsoever!!
so here we have THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, which is a remake of an old thriller that was not sooo great in the first place. This one however, can be only proud (?)of some good photography, a few gripping scenes & fairly decent acting from a few actors. the DVD contains both the UNRATED & Regular versions & barely any extras..at the most its a one time watch.
However see it before your meals if you want to loose your appetite or after meals & throw up..either way this one is difficult to digest!!",1250208000,3,1053,4.489583333333333
3911203,2,B002DKGWSE,"Last House on the Left, the 2009 remake of Wes Craven's 1972 debut film, is by and far a pretty pointless remake.  Garret Dillahunt stars as Krug, an escaped criminal who along with his sadist girlfriend (Riki Lindhome), brother (Aaron Paul), and son (Spencer Treat Clark) in tow.  It isn't long before they come across young Mari (Sara Paxton) and Paige (Martha MacIsaac), whom they proceed to graphically assault and terrorize, and culminate in finding sanctuary with a couple (Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter), who unbeknownst to them are Mari's parents.  The Last House on the Left remake pretty much follows the original to a tee, up until its final few acts, where sadism and shock values become the order of the day.  While Craven's original still remains a bona-fide shocker to this day, the raw feel of the film helped make it so memorable.  Here, everything is so polished that it just doesn't have the same effect, no matter how graphic and long one can make a rape scene seem, which by and far, is nearly impossible to watch.  The film's flaws are a shame, considering that the cast does surprisingly good work here, but in the end, the film just leaves the effect of being ""been there, done that"" more than anything else.  The film is worth a look for fans of the original, as well as those looking for new ways to use their microwave.",1250121600,5,1347,4.6344537815126055
3911204,3,B002DKGWSE,"Having never seen the original, I came into this film with only a vague knowledge of the story.  I know the original is considered a classic, and I really like the up and coming actor Garret Dillahunt, so I gave this one a whirl.  While not directed by Wes ( which to me is a detraction) it is produced by him...and the influence a little evident in the film.  This film is a rape revenge film, not to dissimilar to all of the exploitation flicks of the 70s with the same subject matter, big difference being the budget.  The film is being marketed as a Horror..but is not a horror in the modern sense of the idea of ""horror flick"", it is only a horror as the content is brutal, and many times horrifying...I bet if Terror where a film category this film would more comfortably fit in it.  There are several scenes in this film that are not for the faint of heart, and while other reviewers have panned it as being to graphic...it is not as graphic as other cult classic rape/revenge flicks such as ""I spit on your grave"", or the more modern torture flick ""The Girl Next Door"" in fact there is very little nudity save for the obligatory boob shots.  That is not to say that this movie doesn't have some very disturbing scenes, and may not be suitable for everyone...cuz it does, and it ain't.  Over all the actors carried the day with this one, great acting all around...and an interesting..and somewhat different approach to ideas on social degeneration.  Not gunna change the world..but also ..not the end of it..if you like gore ..or horror/thrillers..check it out.",1249948800,12,1568,4.5159010600706715
3911205,5,B002DKGWSE,"So now Hollywood is remaking virtually every horror classic it can put its hands on...

Certainly the whole thing has a very simple explanation: a) Hollywood studios already own the rights to those films; b) these classics have a huge built-in fan base; c) they do not require 100 million Dollars to make; d) many of those classics look dated to the eyes of young viewers; e) so let's redo them and cash in the fact that everybody will wand to see an updated version of a classic; f) because most of today's horror is crap anyway; g) and everybody loves a classic! So there's nothing really new here and the remaking of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-House-on-the-Left/dp/B001JV5BIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last House on the Left</a>&nbsp;is no different from all other remakes we have seen in recent years.

But the good thing this time is that this remake benefits from:
- A classic story of revenge (something audiences everywhere empathize with),
- A great cast with actors who can really carry a character,
- A great screenplay that keeps the good things,
- A great director who understands the importance of creating genuine tension,
- Lots of good taste.

This last element is the most controversial if we think this story is very brutal (perhaps the most brutal storyline in all those classic horror films from the 70's). Two girls get kidnapped by a family of violent criminals on the run. One of them escapes barely alive... while, on the other hand, the killers end up spending the night in the house of a nice couple who happens to be the girl's parents. Now, in the immortal words of James Brown: ""Payback! Revenge!"" (laughs) Yes, the film is very violent. Yes it gets very brutal and bloody.
But YET it NEVER gets TOO over the top, TOO exaggerated or TOO unbelievable (once you forget the huge coincidence of the premise) because the story is THAT good. Yes it gets desperate, bloody and heavy... but the story asks for it and the scripts constructs it well.

So I think this is perhaps one of the best remakes I've seen in this recent trend of remaking the classics. Of course the original film had some kind of magic that is impossible to reproduce - and I think this new version acknowledges that. the original was cheap, dirty and low budget. In fact, I believe the original 1972 film was one of the best candidates for a great remake because a) it had a truly great screenplay to begin with and b) was one of the cheapest/worst looking/worst polished of all those 70's and 80's films we now call classics.

And that's what really shines on this remake: the care that was invested in order not only to do a remake... but also give us a truly memorable and gruesome story of revenge. Now... after having said this, let me tell you all: that last scene is incredible! It does go over the top. But we forgive it because revenge is so human and the script is so clear that we do go along.

For better or for worse, THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is one of those classic horror stories we all love to watch. It gave us a great film more than 35 years ago and (thanks to the producer's care) it gives us now a great update.

I'm sure this will be banned in many other countries because they don't want this trash to fill there homes and give people ideas. When i started watching this i figured it was just another killers come into town, find the people in the house, everyone hides, some get killed nothing major. Well come to find out its nothing but, 2 young teenage girls, being brutally raped face down in the dirt, stabbed in the stomach and chest after already being beaten, and all this is very very graphically shown in the unrated version. Well after these scenes and me feeling like i wanted to projectile vomit everywhere i shut it off. I sat and thought to myself my god, imagine a movie like this even ten years ago, it was unthinkable. So if yours some sick twist #^#&!@ then this movie will appeal to you, but ask yourself this, would u like to know your daughter was brutally raped, while other people watched, and then shot when she tried to escape. Or any other family member for that matter. This is just tasteless garbage, and trust me i've seen a LOT of brutal movies.

3911208,5,B002DKGWSE,"These days, Hollywood has found itself in the middle of a remake frenzy, plucking up various films and franchises eager to tinker and tool with them for a new generation. By far, horror movies have been at the heart of this storm, with already Halloween and Friday the 13th recieving the treatment and Nightmare on Elm Street following close behind. Now we all know that, usual, remakes usually pale in comparision to the original, but with this new version of The Last House on the Left, that rule does not apply, providing with a film that is both realistic, cerebral, emotional, and definintly a worthy companion to its original.

The plot is essentially almost the same as the original. A family is vacationing up in the woods and one night the daughter and her friend go out for the day, only to be brutally attacked and raped by a group of individuals, who afterward wind up at the girls house, where the parents take this as a chance for sweet revenge.

I wouldn't define this film as a 'horror' movie, which while the original was, this one plays out more like a revenge-thriller film, which is natural considering it was written by the guy who did another Craven picture, the also exceptional thriller 'Red Eye'. And just like that film, the tension is palpable. When you see the tormentors first corner the girls, you can feel your heart pump. As one of them converses with the mother, who at that point has figured them out, you can literally jump at and scream at her to either get out of their or just fight the guy off. It is a very tightly wound film that rarely ever falters in its attempt at giving you edge-of-your-seat thrills.

But LHOTL isen't just about the thrills, there is also a great deal of emotion and some fine acting. When that absolutly brutal killing/rape scene happens, you literally feel your heart just sink and your heart clench to watch these innocent girls be subjected to that. And then not even thirty minutes later when the parents discover her daughter, it is so powerful. This of course would not be possible without the actors, who really do give it their all, especially Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter as the two parents, both of whom bring so much to their roles.

This remake really does rise above and is really one of the more finer horror movies to come along. It is definitly one all horror fanatics need to see and one that everyone should view for a good, heart pounding ride.",1249344000,3,2430,4.5793103448275865
3911209,2,B002DKGWSE,"Last House on the Left (Dennis Iliadis, 2009)

Among hardcore horror fans, I seem to be one of the very few who considers Wes Craven's debut film, The Last House on the Left, to be one of his worst. (Thankfully, I saw The Hills Have Eyes, one of my favorite movies, before that, and was already an established fan when I saw Last House.) When I heard a remake was being done, I figured it would probably be better than the original, and when every criticism levelled at the movie by the Ben show (aka At the Movies) could have equally been levelled at the original movie, I did have some small hope that the remake might actually be worth watching. It was, as I expected, better than the original, but it wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be.

If you've seen the original, the plot will be familiar, though it's got some variations. Two lovely young things, Mary (Superhero Movie's Sara Paxton) and Paige (Superbad's Martha MacIsaac), find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time, and one ends up dead, the other raped. The bad guys end up at Mary's house, where her parents have a perfect opportunity to exact revenge.

The big thing about this one that makes it better than the original is that we actually get a bit of character development, and it's quite well-paced (when was the last time you saw a major, big-budget American horror film with a running time of almost two hours that didn't make you say ""this could be half an hour shorter""?). The big change that didn't work for me, on the other hand, was the general make-up of the parents. One of the things I actually kind of liked about the original was the absolute cheesiness of the parents, who were straight out of the American Gothic painting--old, kind of infirm, but entirely without scruple when it came to torturing and killing the bad guys. The cognitive disjunction there was fascinating; here's an old geezer with the blandest of smiles wielding a chainsaw in order to hack up a dead body. Awesome! In this one, we get young-and-beautifuls as the parents of young-and-beautifuls; we're supposed to believe, somehow, that Monica Potter gave birth to Sara Paxton? I mean, come on, Monica Potter was barely old enough to have given birth to the not-quite-toddler in Saw, and that was only five years before this. Also, the new screenplay, scripted by Adam Alleca and Carl Ellsworth (this is Alleca's first writing credit; Ellsworth's most recent film is Disturbia), gives the parents, especially Potter, much more in the way of moral quandary about killing the bad guys off in inventive ways. It's an interesting reversal of form from the Hills Have Eyes remake, where the moral quandary was taken away. I'm amused.

All in all it's not a terrible little film as long as you can get past the idea (as the Bens obviously couldn't), integral to both the original and the remake, that this movie exists for the sole purpose of allowing the parents to exact brutal, bloody revenge on the bad guys--which also involves making the bad guys bad enough for us to sympathize with, if not cheer for, the parents. It's not deathless cinema, and I'll be amazed if it finds its way into too many permanent collections, but it's worth watching once. Kinda. ** ",1248739200,3,3229,4.647985989492119
