6426992,4,B00KH7D0R6,"This film is extremely colorful and very much a David Cronenberg  affair. . Most of the characters are either clinically insane,drug addicted ,homicidal
 see dead people or all of the above.

It's very off beat, off color with some hilarious even if at times very offensive dialogue. There's male full frontal nudity semi erect. Somewhat explicit sex scenes that include Julliane Moore who isn't shy about being nude either. She looks quite beautiful in some scenes. Her blonde hair for this character is very becoming on her .

The characters are not afraid to say and go places that are somewhat taboo. For example, Julianne Moore who plays an actress named ""Havana Segrand"" farting and talking about her bathroom woes or how she was molested by her late mother.

John Cusack and Olivia Williams play a married couple who happen to be brother and sister. Robert  Pattinson is completely miscast as a limo driver who doesn't lend much at all to the story but looks good doing nothing.

Mia Wasikowaska of (Stoker) fame plays ""Agatha"" personal assistant to Julianne Moore's ""Havana"" she has burns on her from a fire that she may or may not have caused. There is a very unexpected bloody and brutal scene that took me by surprise,and I'm still trying to wrap my mind around the ending. If you like bizarre films you will probably enjoy ""Maps To The Stars"".",1424995200,43,1355,4.764957264957265
6426993,3,B00KH7D0R6,"On the surface ""Maps to the Stars"" looks like yet another Hollywood expos, or 21st century version of ""Sunset Boulevard,"" but David Cronenberg's latest film attempts to be something more, with a Greek tragedy-like story about the Weisses, a celebrity family in Hollywood - Benjie (Evan Bird), a child star after his stint at drug rehab; Cristina (Olivia Williams), his mother and manager desperately trying to get his son's career back on track; and his father Stafford (John Cusack), a popular self-help guru.

Mia Wasikowska plays Agatha, a mysterious girl from Florida with a secret, and Julianne Moore is Havana Segrand, a self-absorbed actress with her career now in decline. Robert Pattinson also appears as Jerome Fontana, a struggling actor/writer working as a limousine driver. The screenplay is penned by Bruce Wagner, who once worked as a driver like Jerome.

You can say ""Maps to the Stars"" is Cronenberg's satire on Hollywood, but it is also a drama about a dysfunctional family. The film has nudities, violence, a cameo of Carrie Fisher (writer of ""Postcards from the Edge"") and very intense acting from Moore as usual. Also, this is the first film that the Canadian director really shot (though partially) in Hollywood.

Despite the unanimously effective performances from the cast, several funny lines from the script, and some interesting use of ""ghosts"" (something uncharacteristic of Cronenberg), I was not much impressed with the film itself. After all, what the film has to tell us about Tinseltown is not really as shocking or insightful as it thinks. Also, certain part of the story (the Greek tragedy part I mentioned) does not simply go together well with the rest of the film.

""Maps to the Stars"" may appeal to those who are interested in the names of the cast (and they all did great work), and director David Cronenberg, whose slick direction I admire, but as to the content, well, ... not exactly.",1423872000,5,1927,4.993769470404985

Violence pursues those around her, including a frustrated actor turned chauffeur (Robert Pattinson) and fading star Havana Segrand (Julianne Moore).

What did I think?

A cavalcade of stars, commentary on celebrity and self-help, incest and tween violence  director David Cronenberg has packed a lot into this film, but nothing sticks. The plot, which gestures at classical tragedy and references surrealist poetry, is often advanced by the appearance of exposition-spewing phantoms and is entirely forgettable.

Cronenbergs direction is excellent as ever, dancing the line between alienation and intimacy. The dialogue between tween superstars is a reminder of his talent for making discomfiture compelling.

6426997,3,B00KH7D0R6,"I cannot fully remember how I found out about this movie, so I can only assume I saw the name of it on IndieWire. With that said, there are a lot of recognizable faces amongst the cast, such as Julianne Moore, Mia Wasikoska, and John Cusack, who all perform their very eccentric characters in such a way that is perplexing to say the least. Now, as for whether their performances lead you to believe the film is worth your time or not, look below.

Characters & Story

The three main storylines are: Havana Segrands (Julianne Moore) which deals with an actress who desperately wants to be in the remake of her mothers biggest film, perhaps in pursuit of closure; one young woman named Agatha (Mia Wasikowska), trying to make amends with Dr. Stafford Weiss (John Cusack), Havanas reiki therapist; and one child star named Benjie (Evan Bird) who feels this new kid Roy (Sean Robertson), is stealing his spotlight.

But what the overall film is about is the two actors, Havana and Benjie, making a comeback. For with Havana seemingly losing the roles she wants to due her age, and perhaps her personality too, she finds herself losing her mind to the point she is seeing her mother Clarice (Sarah Gadon), and is forced to face that maybe what she thought happened in the past didnt. As for Benjie, he too is haunted by ghosts from his past. For as the stress of staying sober meets the stress of a life seemingly forced on him by his parents Cristina (Olivia Williams) and Stafford, we see a girl he met, Cammy (Kiara Glasco), haunt him. Then, on top of all that, a face he wasn't expecting to see again reappears who brings up bad memories.

Praise

When it comes to this film, I feel you must praise Moore and Bird for they play utterly unlikable characters, due to how much they fit many peoples idea of the stereotypical celebrity, and yet they don't make their characters a pain to watch. This is accomplished through them having some form of mastery over their depiction of having schizophrenia, as well as Moores depiction of Havana possibly having depression and issues which may have stemmed from sexual abuse. For while mental illness depictions in movies can either lead to over the top performances, or depressing comedies, arguably Havana is performed with just enough human qualities to make it seem like Moore wanted her to be someone who struggled with mental disorders vs. someone so wholly consumed that Havana could only be seen a caricature.

Then, when it comes to Bird as Benjie, while his character is much more difficult to like, in comparison to Havana, through his interactions with Agatha and Cammy, as well as noting his relationship with his parents, there is this sense that as despicable as he seems, he may more so be coping than acting out because he can. After all, it seems his familys wealth might have came from his success. So imagine the pressure he is under so his mom has work and his dads career, as some sort of motivational speaker, outside of him being a reiki therapist, isn't tainted by his son collapsing under the pressure hes under.

Criticism

I want to note that this is the type of film which, based off the first ten to twenty minutes, you think is going to be awful. This is mostly due to no character really being presented as likable, Wasikowska as Agatha being a bit of a bore, at first, and Benjie being the type of kid you want so badly to get smacked by somebody, anybody, just because the way he acts is like how people often talk about Justin Bieber. Though perhaps my real problem with this movie is that I am not completely sure what writer Bruce Wagner was trying to say with this film. Is he trying to show the worse possible ways people can deal with their own issues, which usually includes taking out their anger, pain, and frustration on others? Is this supposed to be a serious parody, if such a sub-genre exists, on celebrity culture? Or is the point of the film simply to show what happens to a person when they are exploited, or disregarded, to the point where desperation sinks in?

Either way, I feel as interesting of a take the film has on mental illness, Im unsure, if you want to be politically correct, if we are supposed to take the characters various issues seriously or not. Especially Cristinas since, outside of it being established she is a Benjies mother and manager, I feel we don't get to learn hardly a thing at all about her. Making it where when we see her crying hysterically, or watch her final scene in the film, none of it makes sense.

Overall: TV Viewing

I see some talk about Moore getting nominated for major awards for this movie, and honestly if she does I guess she will get nominated for the same reason Cate Blanchett was for Blue Jasmine. More so because of her body of work than the film itself. And while I did note Wasikowska was a bit of a bore at first, truly her character can be considered a stimulant for the film. Especially for Benjie for with her revealing a few things she knows about his parents, as well as how she got her burns, it sets his story in motion. As for Havana, I think what Agatha does for Havana is remind us she was possibly normal once. Something which greatly helps the character become more than a selfish, and childish, prick.",1412467200,5,5265,4.549102428722281

Everyone in it is so psychologically deformed and sexually distant that you don't feel an investment in any of them. A bunch of crazies living in a hall of mirrors, bent on killing one another or themselves. It's quite artsy but not compelling, because there is no norm for the satire, no one to anchor it in consensus reality. You could ask, ""who to believe?"" but it wouldn't matter, because every point of view is skewed--could be valid, could be . . . inverted.

Add in some celebrity cameos and an incest undercurrent and you end up with a weird way to spend nearly 2 hours of your life.

6427018,3,B00KH7D0R6,"David Cronenberg made a reputation for himself by directing over-the-top, bizarre horror movies like ""Scanners"" and ""The Fly"" that frequently seemed to spiral out of control before the film's end. During this century, at least, he has worked on more mainstream, albeit still violent, projects like ""A History of Violence."" With ""Maps to the Stars,"" however, Cronenberg may have produced his most horrifying work yet in that scariest of settings, Hollywood. While the movie's middle portion is often compelling, Cronenberg once again loses control of the project en route to a shocking ending.

""Maps to the Stars"" is an extremely dark satire with a convoluted plot that seems like something Raymond Chandler would have plopped Philip Marlowe right in the middle of. The main characters are all familiar Hollywood archetypes. Stanford Weiss (John Cusack) and his wife Cristina (Olivia Williams) are apparently a typical Los Angeles power couple. He's a TV self-help guru and therapist to the stars, while she's the ruthless agent in charge of the budding acting career of their 13-year-old son Benjie (Evan Bird). That career is in jeopardy ever since Benjie went into rehab and, in general, acted like a complete jerk. Weiss' best known client is fading actress Havana Segrand (Julianne Moore), who's anxious to kickstart her career by starring in a remake of a cult film that made her own actress mother famous. Into this rather unsavory crowd walks Agatha (Mia Wasikowska), fresh off the bus from Florida, whose Twitter friendship with Carrie Fisher lands her a job as Havana's personal assistant.

The movie gets off to somewhat of a slow start, as it takes the audience quite a while to figure out just who all the characters are, and the initial impression most of them leave is distinctly unpleasant but not particularly amusing. However, about 30 minutes in, it begins to hit its stride, with some wicked dark humor, beginning with a Hollywood party that reveals the incredible stupidity and shallowness of some of the characters (the idiocy of Benjies young fans is amazing). The two characters that fare the worst in terms of portrayal are Benjie, who is Justin Bieber without any P.R. whitewashing, and Havana, who is as complete a backstabbing phony as youll ever find.

As Maps to the Stars goes on, it gets more bizarre, with the audience gradually learning just how depraved some of its characters are. There are several surprise twists along the way, and, by films end, almost everyone winds up being even less likable than they seemed originally, which admittedly is a difficult accomplishment, since many of them weren't very likable to begin with. But Cronenberg keeps his revelations coming at a measured pace for quite a while, keeping the audiences attention as he tops himself with one twisted look into a core characters psyche after another.

Unfortunately, Cronenberg lets the whole thing spin out of control in the last half hour. Its not hard to guess that Stars is a movie thats not going to end particularly well, but the storytelling gets completely jumbled and confused, with a couple of the most shocking events thrown in seemingly out of left field. Cronenberg also overuses the gimmick of having the ghosts or visions of a couple of dead characters repeatedly show up to mentally torture two of the major living characters.

Overall, Im giving Maps to the Stars a marginal recommendation, one that would have been a good bit higher had the film ended 20 minutes earlier. Its got a terrific ensemble cast, especially Julianne Moore, who bares herself in more ways than one in what turns out to be one of her better performances. When David Cronenberg is on his game, the movie is darkly compelling and sometimes quite funny. But when he loses it, Maps becomes confusing and simply disgusting. Following this map to the end simply gets the audience lost.",1466812800,,3886,4.9907407407407405

Or do people with an inherent predilection to strangeness find themselves naturally drawn to the business? Whichever it is, doubtless filmdom has its share of loonies who can at once be sympathetic, sad, and pathetic. So, welcome to a movie packed with many cringeworthy moments that will have you turning away from the screen and, perhaps, having you thanking your lucky stars you aren't a movie star.

The film opens with Agatha (Mia Wasikowska, playing mentally wounded beautifully) arriving in Beverly Hills. She pays for a limo, driven by Jerome (Robert Pattinson), a wannabe screenwriter. On the recommendation of Carrie Fisher (herself), whom Agatha has been Twittering, aging star Havana Segrand (Julianne Moore, winner of Cannes Best Actress award for her highly charged and riveting performance), hires her as her gofer.

Memories of her mother torment Havana, who remembers herself being abused by her mother. However, it becomes apparent that its more a case of living as an actress in the shadow of a mother who was a better actress thats actually the root of Savanas problems, which include hallucinating conversations with her mother. Dr. Stafford Weiss (John Cusack, a very convincing charlatan and hypocrite) treats her in some emotionally draining and unorthodox ways.

Also early in the film we meet teen Benjie Weiss (Evan Bird), a former child star, visiting a dying female fan in the hospital, a seemingly kind and empathetic fellow in the medical setting, who reveals the vileness of his character the moment he exits the hospital.

A film filled with twists and low-key but stunningly disturbing moments, it reveals little to say that Agatha is an ill girl, the daughter of the Weisss, who attempted to kill the entire family in a fire. She suffered disfiguring burns and found herself banished forever from the family. She claims to be cured of her psychosis and returned to seek the forgiveness of her parents and brother.

What viewers have here is an extremely sharp satire, a really sardonic look at Hollywood. Havana, for example, is a total basket case, subject to head-swinging mood changes, tortured by her own insecurity, and completely self-absorbed to the point of insensitivity to others, best exhibited by her agony over seeking the role of her mother in a remake of her mothers famous movie, Stolen Waters. It proves stunning stuff, indeed. Benjie is a lost young soul, as taken with himself as Havana is with herself, but even lonelier; a teen without friends in a family that appears to value him for his fame and bankroll.

What viewers also have in this film is an engrossing and jump-out-of-your skin thriller. Youll see scenes at which you will gasp; some you will barely be able to watch. And as for a happy ending, well, if you require green grass, flowers, and smiles at the conclusion of films, Map to the Stars may not be right for you.

6427033,4,B00KH7D0R6,"This film could have been a masterpiece. Or even a classic about life in Hollywood from themes about money,fame,envy and emotional scars.

The presentation of the Weiss family was definitely compelling as we get to meet each one who is making his/her way in Hollywood. There is Stafford Weiss,a famed TV self-help therapist who serves A-list actors and actresses. We also meet Christina Weiss,who works as a manager to a child star who just got out of rehab age 13 named Benjie. But definitely,the most interesting among them happens to be Agatha,a mysteriously tormented and scarred daughter who was just released from a pscyh ward. She goes back in town to re-unite with her family and to seek redemption for herself. As I describe these characters,we could have been treated to a great film. But unfortunately,it wasn't what it was suppose to be.

Too bad that as the story progressed,it loses its tonality as we get to see different genres of films that are being put up together in the story that complicated its message. Too bad that it failed to find a common tone and theme that the viewer could identify with. Too bad that we get exposed too much the negative aspects of the characters that a potential turn off is possible.

It was a good thing that the acting provided a lot for the beauty of the film.

When Cronenberg can be reined in by a tight script he can produce some compelling drama, and there are moments in Maps to the Stars that show glimmers of his special brand of darkness. However the actors here struggle with cardboard characters and self-indulgent dialogue, at the mercy of a plot that congeals into unappetizing mess that ultimately dead ends.

6427055,1,B00KH7D0R6,"Coming from Cronenberg I expected WAY better.

The introduction to this movie is fantastic and the story shows amazing premise early on... And then nothing really happens.

It tries to be a statement on ""celebrity"" (and to a degree, works), but it ultimately doesn't support the better, more disturbing aspects of the story.

One expects the film to go full-blown crazy due to foreshadowing content and imagery, but instead, it all goes out on a whimper. Actually, less than a whimper. More like a sigh. I was especially upset that the movie was rated for STRONG DISTURBING VIOLENCE, yet didn't have anything of the sort!!! I'm not saying it needs grotesqueries to be compelling, but geez! When the movie has only A SINGLE SCENE of off-camera, late-game violence that even a PG-13 movie would be allowed to show (and only lasts about five to ten seconds), how in the world does that connotate that kind of R-rated description? From what the MPAA stated, Maps to the Stars fell in line with all of Cronenberg's other disturbing works. Instead, it's just a blase narrative that hints at great things early on but doesn't follow through with any of the potentially great plot points. It just devolves into a slightly scathing bird flipped at ""the industry"". Um, way to go, I guess?",1439769600,3,1278,4.8

6427059,3,B00KH7D0R6,"The world of David Cronenberg is a dark and twisting place of shadows and other slithery things. He doesn't get light-hearted; his films may be laced with some incredibly dark humor--such as MAPS TO THE STARS--but they aren't comedies and they aren't going to make you smile. His films are always ABOUT something, but it's not something easily discernible. It's not necessarily something you will understand.

Got that? Okay. Here's the problem with MAPS TO THE STARS: it's pretty accessible, for a Cronenberg film. And yet...it's still a Cronenberg film. It's not really a dissection of celebrity culture, inasmuch as it's a psycho-drama about family secrets and hereditary violence that just happens to play upon the charade of acting and the indulgence of celebrity. The plot essentially revolves around Agatha (an incredible Mia Wasikowska), a scarred young woman with a tenuous relationship with celebrity (she claims to have struck up a relationship with Carrie Fisher on Twitter). Naturally, very little is as it initially seems. Cue some truly disturbing imagery (disturbing, not graphic, though yes, it gets graphic eventually) that mixes dreams and reality, and a violent conclusion that doesn't tie too many threads together, but isn't supposed to, either.

MAPS TO THE STARS isn't for everyone. It's for Cronenberg fans pretty much, except it's kind of Cronenberg-lite. Oh, there are some true gems here; Wasikowska is fantastic, Julianne Moore is superb, Evan Bird is pitch-perfect, and John Cusak finally gets to sink his teeth into a Cronenberg role (something I've been waiting on for a long time; Cusak is an underrated actor, thanks largely to the schlock he does to fund more independent work like this). The cinematography is on-point, and the dialogue and imagery, not to mention the sure-handed direction, is what you expect from a Cronenberg film. The themes are right up his alley and executed more-or-less effectively. But...but it just feels empty. Moments of near-greatness, surrounded by mediocrity, don't make a great film. Perhaps if this were a new filmmaker, I would be saying, ""This film has a ton of promise; I can't wait for great things in the future."" But this is David Cronenberg; by this point, we can expect greatness. Obviously, we aren't always going to get it; art doesn't work that way. And MAPS TO THE STARS has much to offer its viewers, if you can put up with feeling very uncomfortable (if you're a Cronenberg fan, you're used to this). But it isn't everything it could have been. It's a promising film from a director who, more times than not, exceeds that promise.",1439164800,,2614,5.062645011600928

6427063,5,B00KH7D0R6,"I want to clear up some of the misunderstandings that I think result in some of the poor reviews here. This is a superb movie of psychological depths and gothic horror.  It is NOT a satire of Hollywood and its symbolic ""incestuousness"".  The setting in this case is Hollywood, but the basic story could have been set in any place or time in which family empires are at stake, where the culture is glittering and awsome, yet also shallow and venial, where children are made to bear responsibility for the family fortune, where sex is currency and nubes and pros alike vie with each other for the lion's share of power, money and fame. The true town portrayed here is interior to the characters not exterior.  This is a movie about unhappy families and individuals stressed to the breaking point. There is a saying that all happy families are happy in the same way, but all unhappy families are different. I always thought that was crap, and we can see that here. The themes of incest, fire, a certain movie and one special poem run through these families like a poisoned river.  The media within media (the movie within this movie and the poem) is used a lot like in Cloud Atlas, where works of art matter to the characters and reveal a practically spiritual-level understanding of characters and plot.  The biggest theme is trespass: the children of the film: the teen brother and sister, the ghost children and the adult daughter who refuses to leave her mother's shadow are/were forced to take the sins, talents, ambitions and desires of others (most notably parents) upon themselves, with predictably perverse and horrible consequences.  Maps to the Stars is explosive and catastrophic, like an Elizabethan play it offends and excites in equal measure.  The movie simply isn't meant to be taken as realism, it is more like magical realism (look it up) and in my humble opinion it's a freaking masterpeice. One can tell from most of the poor reviews that the viewers were expecting a linear story, simply told, high in realism with only explainable and rational events, and so the last fire scene really pissed them off.  None of the movie is meant to be completely literal (especially that scene, which I think is brilliant): it tells a story and the story is powerful and you might recognize yourself or society in it, but it is a story of the inside, not outside. For example you could think of reasons why the character on fire might be psychologically ""on fire"" and at that specific time... I hope that makes sense and this was helpful.",1438300800,,2543,4.711711711711712

The mood, music and atmosphere feels very much like the art film Muholland Drive, it's very empty, lonely and dark. The humor feels more like a slapstick comedy that parodies Hollywood actors. The acting is top notch on top of a goofy script. There's also a ghost story thrown into the middle of it too. All these oppositional elements are thrown together to create something new and interesting, if you enjoy experimental films this is your film.

6427078,3,B00KH7D0R6,"David Cronenberg is an interesting director to say the least.  I can't say that I'm a huge fan but I can appreciate much of his work.  This film seemed to be promoted mostly as a satire of Hollywood and has a fine cast so I thought it was worth a look.

There are 2 central story lines that intersect.  Julianne Moore plays Havana Segrand, an actress past her prime who is angling hard for a role in a remake of a classic movie for which her mother received an Oscar nomination.  Mia Wasikowska plays Agatha Weiss, a young woman returning to Los Angeles after a long stent in a Florida treatment center for schizophrenia.  A Twitter buddy with Carrie Fisher (quick cameo), she's introduced to Havana who needs a personal assistant.  Agatha's brother, Benjie (Evan Bird) is a child star of a movie called ""The Babysitter"" which is about to shoot a sequel.  Benjie is a real jerk, with fame and money overwhelming him at the tender age of about 16.  Benjie's parents are Christina (Olivia Williams), a hovering mom and Stafford (John Cusack), a psychologist and sometime masseuse and more, of Havana.

None of these people are likeable or remotely sympathetic.  Robert Pattinson's Jerome comes the closest.  He's a chauffeur on occasion for Havana and meets Agatha for a quick fling or two.  Jerome dabbles with acting, finding bit roles but has his sights set on writing.  As the story progresses we know that Agatha has returned to California to make amends with her family for some event in their past.  The family wants no part of her, especially Stafford.  As the film moves toward the final act, we learn of a dark secret about the Weiss's, albeit seemingly ridiculous.  Havana has her own secrets, recalled in mental flashbacks that are just as creepy.

While the acting is excellent from everyone, the movie isn't enjoyable or entertaining.  The satirical aspect?  Well, I guess it's there but I lost track of what Cronenberg was trying to say about half way in.

This is a nominal Blu ray transfer, coming with 1080p video resolution and an original 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  While it's hard to pinpoint abnormalities in the picture, it just seemed a bit flat to me.  Nothing remarkable.  Black levels are fine and skin tones looked accurate.  Similarly, the audio track is good, not great.  The best option is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 which is effective, especially with the nice score.  This is a dialog-centric film, so I didn't really expect much in the way of dazzling sound.  Subtitles are available in Spanish, French and English SDH.  There are no extras.",1435795200,3,2565,4.752834467120182
6427079,5,B00KH7D0R6,"Wow, I was not expecting that ending! The build up was intense, and bittersweet, the body of the movie showed just how complacent people can get, especially when they are totally in love with themselves, have a huge sense of entitlement, and believe that the whole world feels that they deserve to be this way, and that it will indulge them with it indefinitely. Excellent choices of actors and actresses, not anyone could have embraced these personalities as well as these stars did, they really made you believe that you were there. It gives a whole lot of material to think about in the things that it indicates but does not say, and a lot of room for speculation.

And I don't mean this in the context of, ""I didn't find these attempts at humor funny.""  I mean, I couldn't figure out what parts were *supposed* to be funny.

This movie reminded me of the 1980's, when we were more fascinated with the problems of the wealthy and successful.  We had Dallas, Dynasty, Falcon Crest, etc... all giving us a peek into the ""money can't buy you happiness"" world of the rich and powerful.  And I just don't think this is the right time for a movie about self-centered rich people who have forgotten what real problems are.  Your child star of a son isn't finding his career satisfying?  Boo-freaking-hoo.  You can't find the right maid for you?  Pardon me while I wipe the tears from my eyes.  You didn't get the role you wanted?  Waaaaah!  Can we agree to a moratorium on movies about the movie business?  It's been done to death.

So, while this might have worked in the ""me"" decade, it's impossible to generate any amount of sympathy for these people.  The mentally-ill daughter character and accompanying plot had the occasional moment of bringing the movie up to ""mildly interesting,"" but it's way too little to save this tragic waste of talent.

6427125,4,B00KH7D0R6,"David Cronenbergs portrayal of Hollywood, its stars and the sycophants who crowd their lives is a masterpiece and dark tale of human evil. Fading star Havana and child star Benji are narcissistic and repulsive. Cronenbergs depiction of them is both the films strength and weakness. For the first half hour it is difficult to justify watching Maps to the Stars as the celebrities and their entourage abuse themselves and inflict abuse on others. The characters, with a few exceptions, are shallow and self-serving to the extreme. Cronenberg amplifies their base, shallow and confronting behaviour by bringing the camera closer and resting the lens longer over their personal lives. At times the tension and discomfort becomes unbearable to the point that its tempting to walk out on the film which justifies my 4 star rating. Human evil and the characters sheer unpleasantness that pervades the film is unrelenting; as is the violence and dysfunctionality. The humour is thunderously black, but easily identifiable. Despite Havana and Benjis awfulness they do manage to elicit some audience sympathy. Most sympathy is evoke by Agatha who is truly a helpless victim. With an objective eye viewers can recognise that the two stars are products of conditioning, abuse and the sordid Hollywood world that largely shaped them. Viewers can, therefore, afford them a degree of sympathy. More disturbingly, Havana and Benji are not the most detestable or malevolent characters. John Cusacks portrayal as Benjis father is chillingly sinister as one of the individuals who manipulates and exploits others for his own means. Even when faced with disaster, he sees a way of turning circumstances to his advantage. It is these individuals who prey on the stars vulnerability that ultimately brings inevitable tragedy. Ironically, or because of these power hungry individuals, it is possible to feel some sympathy for the pampered and tortured Havana, and burnt out and cynical child star Benji who has the spoiled and sour demeanour of a clapped out older star. If you persist with the film beyond the first half you will almost certainly be compelled to watch the lives of the Hollywood set spiral into the train wreaks they become. Alongside them more sympathetic characters become helpless victims pulled to their doom. There are elements of the horror story where ghosts appear to torment the living. Cronenberg also shines a light on the dysfunctionality, greed and corruption of modern society.",1431820800,,2486,5.2330827067669174

Me being a David Cronenberg fan from watching his films since wow ve been a kid. I really like (Shivers) (The Fly) (Naked Lunch) (A History of Violence). I found Maps to the Stars to be quite intertaining. I been waiting for this film for 3 years now!!  Finally got a chance to view it. I being a fan of euro horror films, it was enjoyable to me. I disagree with most the reviews on here and other sites that ve read for the past 2 1/2 years. Their either kids who haven't seen a Cronenberg movie or not a Cronenberg fan. Such scenes remind me of the cult classic in the 70's early part of the decade (Let's Scare Jessica to Death) when Havana Sagrand sees her mother's ghost in the bath tub in a white old dress seemingly dating back from the 17th century, soaking wet. Benjie sees the little girl who died at the hospital also in a white dress. In that film a lady vampire is shown coming up from a lake in a white dress...
Most scenes were shoot in Los Angeles such as Rodeo drive; Mulholland drive ect. I like to call this film of David Cronenberg his most beautiful, colorful film he has ever made. It's less dialogue and more so on scenery and art. Its based off Hollywood. Some parts were believable, BUT also a very unrealistic point of view of Los Angeles. Its a ghotic atmosphere of L.A. With a gravitational pull on these characters, that they want to escape but they can't get out. Beacuse it won't let them! It was depressing; funny; dark; and creepy. I've watched it twice already, the second viewing was even better! Yes, there is graphic nudity so be warned. Mia Wasikowska character is centered around everyone in this film so she plays a big role here. With good acting. I will not spoil the ending. A good collaboration between Bruce Wagner and David Cronenberg. Easily one of my favorite movies of 2014-2015. David Cronenberg never disappoints me. He's
very clever, very talented indeed. I recommend it if your a Cronenberg fan like i am. I couldn't look away for a second. Its a 111mins. of pure enjoyment. As you watch the lives of these Hollywood stars to their highs, to their extremly dark depressing lows...",1429488000,,2241,4.465853658536585

Much of the plot was left unexplored, beyond a few pointless conversations.  There was never any exploration into the depths of the character's emotions, leaving most of the performances wooden.  A rather big deal involving incest was kind of glossed over until later, when it was spoke about in brief passing.

This movie seemed to have several different ideas, each running counter to one another.  It was almost as if there were completely different directors for each scene, only possessing a broad understanding of the script and no knowledge of the preceding or successive scenes.

6427196,4,B00KH7D0R6,"I consider myself a David Cronenberg fan, yet his last few films haven't really been up to par with his best work. MAPS TO THE STARS does represent an improvement over COSMOPOLIS (which bored me to tears), but the narrative lacks the cohesion required to make a satire like this fully work. Cronenberg has collected a great ensemble cast featuring Julianne Moore, Robert Pattinson, Olivia Williams, John Cusack and Mia Wasikowska in a film that explores the seamy underbelly of Hollywood, and how quite literally incestuous it is. Julianne Moore stars as Havana Segrand, an actress who is auditioning for the lead role in a remake of a film her mother starred in. John Cusack plays a self-help guru/massage therapist who is married to Olivia Williams. Olivia Williams plays the mother of a child actor who is negotiating terms to appear in a sequel to one of his previous hits. Finally, Mia Wasikowska plays a somewhat mysterious girl who arrives in Hollywood and becomes Julianne Moore's personal assistant. Despite the narrative faults, what the film does well is show how the business side of Hollywood works, as well as take some pot shots at the way things work there. There was also some really well-written dialogue that was delivered quite well by the cast. Still, nothing they say was terribly unique or inventive. Hollywood satires have been done before and this film didn't really bring anything new to the table. The performances I thought were really good, though. Julianne Moore probably does the best out of them playing this slightly whiny, self-obsessed, self-loathing actress who constantly lives in the shadow of her mother. She (and other members of the cast) are subject to these hallucinations of people in their lives who have died, which I thought was pretty cool. It was kind of literal in the sense that they're literally dealing with demons in their past, but it made things a little more interesting. What I don't think worked is the loose construction of the narrative, and that they never fully commit to any of the story-lines. All that links them together is the interconnected relationships of the characters and the incest theme, which is handled in quite a heavy-handed and literal fashion. Overall, I did like the film but mainly because of the cast, different character moments and the dialogue, not because it was some radically subversive satire on Hollywood (which it isn't). If you're a Cronenberg fan, by all means check it out. For everyone else, you might be better served by starting with his earlier work.",1427414400,2,2551,4.948717948717949

6427198,1,B00KH7D0R6,"Bruce Wagner really hit his peak with the novel Force Majeure but apparently walked away from that novel with the mistaken belief that pandering to the seedy underbelly of Hollywood would insure continued success. If he and David Cronenberg were not close personal friends, I have no doubt this film would never have been made. The ""voice"" behind this screenplay is dated and misanthropic, but most importantly, uninspired. No doubt, he can claim the ultimate victory in his own mind, that his name is in the credits and he has attained his own piece of the Hollywood legacy. As true as that may be, that legacy carries the truth that he chose to be part of that very underbelly he trained his keen eye upon, sort of a mawkish Scotty Bowers without the affability or healthy sexual elan.

Julianne Moore did the best she could with the material she was given. The teenage boy in the movie was just a little too flat and his performance seemed to me just a little too monotone for the character flaws he was meant to portray. The movie had such potential to be a powerhouse in depth look at just how bad the jainted (spelling?) souls of some of Hollywoods stars can fall and in such cases how bad humans can treat each other. Instead it just came across as crude and forced with a waste of a ""shocking"" climax and poorly done ending.

6427231,5,B00KH7D0R6,"My other favorite movie of 2014 (along with Pride, directed by Matthew Warchus) is David Cronenberg's Maps to the Stars.  I won't recommend it exactly, because it is dark dark dark.  Not to everyone's taste.  How many other movies make a compelling case for teen suicide?  And how many build the plot around the text of a surrealist French poem?

Mordant yet tender.  Hopeless yet romantic. Combines elements of Sunset Boulevard, Happiness, What Just Happened?, The Sixth Sense, and Fall of the House of Usher.  Vicious Hollywood satire, incest horror, ghosts.

But if you are open to all that, it grabs you from the first shot (in a cross-country bus; love that upholstery!) and never lets go.  I found it intensely entertaining.  I had planned to re-watch only the first scene again last night and wound up sitting through the whole thing a second time.

Brilliant script by Bruce Wagner, whom I have never heard of.  I expect I missed many of his pop-culture references, because some of them I just barely got.  For example, when at one point the maniac child star says, I AM the franchise, someone else responds Goo-goo-gjoob!  As in I Am the Walrus.  (Mr. Wagner was married long ago to Rebecca de Mornay, so I am tempted to call this movie his second big break.)

The casting is flawless from top to bottom, with Julianne Moore and a 13-year-old named Evan Bird (he reminds me of James Stewart) especially jaw-dropping.  And while every character's behavior is appalling at times (well, most times), it is never less than recognizably human in its clarity and intent.  When Julianne Moore sings and dances to Na-Na-Hey-Hey Kiss Him Goodbye, I suggest you will be as shocked as I was.  Yet the characters rouse the faculties of both empathy and contempt -- a challenging and exhilarating combo which only mature and commanding artists are capable of pulling off.

Also starring Mia Wasikowska, John Cusack, Robert Pattinson, Olivia Williams, Carrie Fisher (very believable as herself) and a bunch of people whose names I do not recognize but who are all impeccable.  One standout among these is Sarah Gadon, utterly credible as both a Hollywood agent and a genuine human.

The costumes are brilliant -- glamorous, specific, and (with the exception of Mia Wasikowska's morbid outfits) hideous.

My favorite line: ""Thirteen summers isn't so bad.""

6427286,3,B00KH7D0R6,"When Cronenberg hits the right note, his films have a magic mix of weird personalities, who in extraordinary circumstances end up the perpetratiors of horrific violence that the viewer can believe.  No one does atmospherics like he does, and the psychology of his great actors arrives in a place that no other director can take you.  Dead Ringers and A History of Violence are 2 of the finest films I have ever seen.  Unfortunately, this is not one of those films:  it is simply weird and horrible, without respite, and I could never quite suspend my disbelief.

The story is about a Hollywood family with a child star and many dark secrets; they are barely holding on with career pressures and looming mental illness, along with depressingly stupid new-age crock.  There is also a fading star (Moore), who is desperate to make a comeback and is crazy in her own way.  Of course, they make for an explosive combination that leads to a perfectly awful conclusion.  The trouble was, none of the characters (with the exception of the vulnerable disfigured girl who shows up) made me care about them - they were all complete idiots or jerks.

On the positive side, the film does a great job of showing how awful it would be to make a career in Hollywood (not that I needed convincing).  The actors are all better than excellent, it is just that their roles aren't that good.  Even Julianne Moore looks looks thugishly ugly, just like her personality.

The pair of them make their every scene creepily fascinating. There are some great zingers about how awful Hollywood people are. But that half of the movie never jibes with the other, more Cronenbergian half, the incest-ghosts-murder plot, so by the end it's very unclear what the movie was trying to say or what it wanted you to feel.

6427376,3,B00KH7D0R6,"""Maps to the Stars"" (2014 release; 111 min.) brings the story of Agatha (played by Mia Wasikowska). As the movie opens, we see Agatha arriving in LA after a long bus ride. Agatha has marks on her face and wears long gloves to hide the marks on her arms. In a parallel story line, we get to know Havana (played by Julianne Moore), an aging actress who is desperately trying to win the role to play her mother, an actress who passed away at an early age. The first time we see Havana, she is in a therapy session with Stafford Weiss (played by John Cusack), who is trying to keep Havana from completely falling apart. We also get to know Stafford's son Benji, a 12 yr. old child star who has just returned from detox and is about to shoot a new movie. How did Agatha suffer those marks? Will Havana play the role of her deceased mother in the new bio-pic of her mother's life? And how do all of these characters fit together? To tell you more would spil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from  Canadian director David Cronenberg. I used to love Cronenberg, back in the day (Videodrome; The Fly; Crash) but lately it seems the man has simply lost the plot. His previous movie, the 2012 Robert Pattison-starring ""Cosmopolis"" was truly dreadful. ""Maps to the Stars"" isn't much better I'm afraid, and it's certainly not because of lack of star power: Julianne Moore, John Cusack, Mia Wasikowska, Robert Pattison, Sarah Gadon, and on and on. The main problem of this movie is that it brings us an insider-Hollywood story that simply cannot find any traction or make us care for any of these characters. It begs the question: what exactly is the point of this movie? I honestly have no better clue after having seen the movie... The only reason that I'm still giving this a 3 star rating is Julianne Moore. She recently won her first Best Actress Oscar for her role in ""Still Alice"", but honestly, I believe the performance that Moore gives in this movie is even stronger. People seem to have forgotten that when ""Maps to the Stars"" debuted at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, Moore won the coveted ""Best Actress"" award at the festival. Due to an inexplicable and largely absent marketing campaign for this movie following Cannes, Julianne Moore's performance in this was basically ""out of sight, out of mind"". So even though this is not a great movie, I'd still recommend you check this out, strictly for Moore's performance.

I have no idea why this movie disappeared into a black hole following the Cannes film festival or why now (late February, 2015) this movie appeared out of nowhere, without any pre-release hype or advertising, at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. My curiosity was such that I went to see it right away. The evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great. Given the pretty dismal reviews this has been getting, I can't imagine this will play long in the theaters. That said, if you have the chance to see this, be it in theaters, here on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, by all means go for it and draw your own conclusion about this film.",1425081600,9,3206,4.581881533101045
6427377,2,B00KH7D0R6,"A stale, stagnant film-industry satire.  What a disappointment.  The comic targets are so, so obvious and played out:  the diva-style behavior of stars, the absurdity of New Age self-help programs, the very existence of Justin Bieber, etc.  And its motions toward a more foreboding and poignant tapestry of betrayals, secrets, and ghosts (figurative and literal) never cohere into a satisfying whole; we never invest in these ""characters"" (grotesque caricatures) nor is there any sense of momentum as they obviously move closer and closer to self-destruction.  The lion's share of the blame must be laid at the feet of iconic director David Cronenberg, sadly.  His direction, razor-sharp and visionary in the past, is inert and lax, and the film feels cheaply produced.  (One major third-act moment is completely undermined by computer-generated fire so inauthentic as to be shameful.  No one involved with this film's post-production thought this needed to be addressed?  How?)  There are, at least, a pair of engaging performances:  Julianne Moore devours the scenery in an outrageous, vanity-free turn as a faded star desperate to reinvigorate her career, and Mia Wasikowska is at once creepy and soulful as Agatha, an enigmatic burn victim whose abrupt return to L.A. after a long period of hospitalization causes much consternation.",1424995200,11,1337,5.3798076923076925

The film has brilliant acting all around, especially Julianne Moore and Mia Wasikowska (last seen together in ""The Kids Are Alright"") and some people will find it masterful and darkly funny, others will find it repellent (all those reactions are understandable). ""Maps"" is definitely disturbing - the ghoulishness of the characters may be too much for some, but I found it compelling, sad, and impossible to ignore. David Cronenberg doesn't make films for the faint of heart, and Bruce Wagner's script drips venom (while deftly embedding celestial and Dharmic law). Movies that dissect Hollywood have obviously been done before, but this one is about more than Hollywood (Heart of Darkness), and it may require more than one viewing to pick up all the threads and to connect all the ""Stars"" that individually burn and implode, but that when viewed from some distance, form a greater constellation.",1424995200,5,1026,5.149700598802395

It's also in the league of Mulholland Drive, Sunset Boulevard and other great movies that explore what's rotten in the state of Hollywood. Not only does Maps to the Stars reference these movies, it also makes nods to Cronenberg's body of work. However, it's not quite like any of the director's other movies, especially for its Crash-like (the other Crash) hyperlink structure that to my knowledge he's never used before. The links in this web are Hollywood archetypes like a self-help guru (John Cusack), a fading basket case actress (Julianne Moore), a spoiled, amoral teen idol (Evan Bird) and a struggling actor/screenwriter (Robert Pattinson). Through their interactions, we not only see how trauma, enablement, deception, abuse and everything else that's been in the news since 2017 is allowed to happen, but also how they persist: it's no coincidence that the ""big project"" in this movie is a remake or that the guru and idol are father and son. The movie isn't without its flaws: Cronenberg's clinical approach doesn't always do the movie favors and there's a special effect - you'll know it when you see it - that is laughable. All the same, it's exactly the kind of movie that needs to be seen now that Hollywood has reared its ugly head.
