7712020,5,B01DEQ98HC,"In a popular anime and manga subgenre that includes Sword Art Online, Log Horizon stands out because instead of being Yet Another story about how do they escape from a computer game gone insane, this is the story of how do they make their online life better until they figure out how to escape it and go home.  More importantly, as ties binding characters to this world increase along with the time spent there, how many of these gamers would choose to go home rather than stay if they eventually get the chance?

Note: The two seasons of this show have been released on four DVD or Blu-ray sets, with each season split at about the halfway point, episodes 13-14:

Following the Catastrophe, the update that traps them in the game, the characters of Log Horizon distinguish themselves from all of the other such characters in such shows by concentrating on building and improving their world, and it is fairly remarkable when one compares the time spent in battle with the time spent in something else.  In particular in this second half of season 2 a lot more effort is put into arranging the politics and the allies for the various battles than in the actual battling itself.  Also of particular note is the training of and separate adventures of the low-level brigade of player characters.

Defects?  About the only noticeable one is the overused Harem Plot Device: the main hero, the virginal Shiroe, acquires something approaching half a dozen of ladies in various levels of love for him of which he is totally clueless, and let's not even bring up Soujiro Seto's West Wind Brigade.

My title reference?  Well, I was not much surprised to learn that the previous Manga/Anime for which Mamare Touno was famous for was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/M-A-O-Y-U/dp/B00IOFDKAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">M.A.O.Y.U.</a>, a course on Medieval macroeconomics and geopolitics disguised as a fantasy adventure.  I'd recommend picking it up while you are waiting for season 3 of Log Horizon to be released.",1470787200,2,2720,6.488950276243094
7712021,5,B01DEQ98HC,"one of my favorite anime's, I really hope they make a third season, I haven't finished this part yet of season 2 but I'm getting to it. Great show, not sure what that one review by some famous anime reviewer was talking about when she said there is bland character design or something like that, I think they're fine.",1470355200,,317,4.389830508474576

8755730,5,B01DEQ98HC,"LOVE This series, the character are well written and very likable, the story is well written and you'll find yourself binge-watching it before you know it. The 1 season was my favorite of the 2 but season 2 wasn't bad it just felt like a lot of filler compared to what there crammed into the first season. I'm still hoping for a season 3!!",1506470400,,339,4.3125
