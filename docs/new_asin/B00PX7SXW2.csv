8689627,5,B00PX7SXW2,"THE GREATEST BROADWAY star ever. This is a 5 star movie. Everyone she made were 5 star. She was equal to Betty Davis, Joan Crawford, Norma Shear, Claudette Cobert, Katherine Hepburn, man other great ladies of the time but did her talent live on a Broadway stage. Left Hollywood because she would not act on her back on the casting couch with the Producer/Director. Could read a script once and know everybody's lines and cues. Could quote any verse in The Bible at the drop of a hat. She read it till she memorized it. Wonderfull acting by the grandest stage and screen actress ever. Her few films she did could have and would have be memorialized in hollywood legend had the studio really put itself behind Tallulah. They did not and unfortunately no one there at the time had any sense or insight to see what potential was locked-up inside that great little ladie (oh some tried to get inside....). Oh well idiots everywhere. Even still @ Universal because they still have no staff who have any sense God gave a goose because in the vaults are treasures from what was once known as The Golden Age of Hollywood. I will still purchase any bootlegged copies of Talullah I can find on the internet even if they are poor reproductions. Better than nothing. This is an example of a classic which universal will not release. What is needed is for a CEO  who is old enough to remember those glorious days, fire all this young punks who are still toilet traning and hire some folks who are very familiar with the great stars of yesterday who are unfortunately gone now. And release their movies on DVD for the public before something else happens and they are lost forever!!! Hire me I will make you millions off the Golden Age of Hollywood.",1441324800,4,1734,4.5576923076923075
