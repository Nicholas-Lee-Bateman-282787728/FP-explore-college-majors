586616,5,6303139663,"I first read this book when I was in the 7th grade.  I didn't understand it all then, because there are a lot of levels to the story.  I so identified with Adam, felt so alone, felt all this stuff inside me, wanted to be a writer and kept a journal full of what was in my head, felt like screaming and screaming and never stopping.  I'd read the book twice, I think, when I chanced upon the movie late one night on cable more than 20 years ago.  I was with a friend, and couldn't really let myself go into the movie like I wanted, but remembered liking it, and especially the punch (you'll know what I'm talking about if you see the movie).  I spent years looking for a copy, and finally found a VHS copy, which I promptly ordered.

  When it showed up, I took the TV and the VCR and set them up in my bedroom and sat on my bed in the corner to watch it.  This was such a personal story to me, I wasn't going to share that first watching with anyone.  It was...very very well done.  The story has changed slightly from the book, especially the parts with Amy, but I was glad to see them.  I'd have loved it being just like the book, of course, but the changes made, kind of give Adam an ""adolescent growing up"" feel.  The soundtrack is very subdued, but perfect.  Violin, Oboe, Cello, I'm not sure which is used, but it's about the only instrument used through much of the film, and it really adds that touch of loneliness, of being so alone, especially on Adam's bike ride.  There's a bit of music that plays at times throughout that mimics part of ""The Farmer in the Dell"" that has stayed with me all these years, as Adam, eternally riding his father's bike on that lonely ride to Monument in my head.  They both play together in my mind.

  Robert MacNaughton, who played Elliot's older brother in ""E.T."", was the perfect Adam.  I've seen several different covers for the book, one of which shows a boy, who looks to be about 8 years old at the most, in some kind of prison cell or something similar.  And while the feel of the cover captures the essence of the book, the boy is far too young.  Robert MacNaughton is just the right age and does such a great job in this, you have to wonder why his acting career never took off.  As I'm watching this, he IS Adam.  It's like there isn't any acting involved.  Someone followed Adam around with a camera filming his life, and released it as a movie.

  Some people talk about the cold relationship he and Doctor Brint have, how unrealistic it is, and thus makes a poorer movie.  I disagree completely.  For Adam's part, all that has happened to him, though he can remember only parts of it, have lead him to be distrustful of anybody in authority (in fact, that was the theme of Cormier's book, man versus government/authority and how man ultimately loses), and Brint is certainly an authority figure, and one who seems to be trying get specific things out of Adam, all the while trying to help him.  There's at least one scene where Brint is asking him specific questions and Adam starts to get paranoid and asks repeatedly to end the session.  So it's no surprise Adam doesn't warm up completely to Doctor Brint.  And as for Brint's part, he knows, ultimately, what is going to happen to Adam once he gets all the information his superiors are wanting, and thus I can easily see him not wanting to get close to this particular patient.  Part of him just wants to think of Adam as a tool, so when the eventual end happens, it won't affect him emotinally, but another part of him is still the doctor, wanting to help, and can't distance himself completely.  Which is why, at the end of the movie, he does nothing when he sees Adam through the window, on his bike, riding near the van.

  The only actor I had problems with was Adam's father (Don Murray), who gives a completely wooden performance in this, which is surprising considering I've seen him do a fine job in other movies, like ""Quarterback Princess,"" and ""Peggy Sue Got Married.""

  This has the feel of a low-budget movie, but that very feel works to its benefit.  More money, a slicker production, would have taken away from the essence of the movie, that core feeling that runs through both the movie and the book.

  The movie begins with Adam waking up, putting on his coat and picking up a wrapped package, and starting off on his bike.  It switches after a bit to Adam in a room, meeting Doctor Brint.  It switches back and forth between the bike ride and the psychiatric sessions with Brint, and scenes from Adam's life as Brint helps him to remember them.  The bike ride is not uneventful, but always lonely, even when other people are encountered.  The music meshes perfectly with the scenes, and once the movie is over, you find yourself thinking about all the different levels to this story.  The book has them all, but the movie really helps to bring them out.  The endings are different between the movie and the book, but unlike most book-to-movie adaptations, I don't mind.  After years of living with the book, and that ride, and those sessions, in my head, I needed the ending the movie gave me.

  I highly recommend watching the movie and reading the book, most especially to those not yet adults, but to people of all ages.  It is a tale that makes you think, that makes you feel, and doesn't just provide an hour and a half of entertainment easily forgotten when the next movie is on.  This one will stay with you for a very long time, if not forever.

  I gave the movie 5 stars because it's better than 4.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd rate a 9, but that doesn't quite break down to 4 of 5.",1137283200,23,5623,4.354186717998075
586617,4,6303139663,I have been looking for a copy of the VHS version of I am the Cheese novel for several years.  I not only found it; I found it in excellent condition at a reasonable price.  Thanks.,1125705600,,181,4.0

586619,2,6303139663,"I must admit that I have never been a fan of Robert Cormier's young adult novels.  Although they did tackle cutting edge themes, I never believed them.  None of the characters reminded me of kids I knew, or mirrored my experience.  Cormier seemed like an adult trying to connect with teens but never quite managing it.  He got far enough to upset some religious groups and get a few books banned, but he never crept into the consciousness of his readers.  The fault lies in the simple, wooden prose that condescends to, rather than engages, the reader, and in Cormier's ""after-school special"" subjects.
The film of ""I am the Cheese"" does not improve on the novel.  Our hero finds himself in a mental hospital with amnesia, trying to remember what happened to his parents.  We flash back to various moments in the past as he tries to recall the deep, dark secrets of his life.  Needless to say, ""The Catcher in the Rye"" this is not.  Despite one hug-filled scene, no relationship- antagonistic or otherwise- exists between our hero and his shrink (Robert Wagner), leaving their scenes together flat and unconvincing.  These scenes stop the film dead, and none of the hero's revelations packs any emotional punch.
In fact, the whole film is so laid back that not even younger children will find any suspense here.",1033084800,4,1311,4.761061946902655
586620,3,6303139663,"Based on young adult author, Robert Cormier's chilling 1970's classic.  You simply have to read the book to understand, and feel this story.  I read the book in 9 th grade and was disturbed for days!  About a year later I saw the movie in the video store, rented it, and dubbed it.  The suspense of the book is better.  Anyway... Elliot's brother from ""E.T."" plays young Adam Farmer, or is he?  Adam goes on a mental and physical journey, more mental, to discover his true identity. The book's confusing enough, but you have to be glued to the tv to follow this movie.  Not a bad movie, more for teens, certainly heavy though.  I get that Adam's father was involved in some illegal activity, hence the family lives on the run.  I don't want to give the movie away... Watch the movie, then read the book, or vice versa, but you SHOULD read the book.  Trust me.  Not a Friday night movie by any means, but worth a look for curiosity's sake. A little out dated now.  Robert Cormier has a bit part as a news editor.  Released in theaters for a sort time, then quickly went to video.  If this movie was made now, it could be better. Cormier was against making this a movie from the start.",1004400000,9,1183,4.318181818181818
586621,2,6303139663,"Although highly regarded as a superb independent film from many qualified sources including The New York Times, I found this rare, hard-to-find video to be lacking in substance and heavy on uninvolved emotional suspense. Intended primarily for a adolescent audience and derived from a popular juvenile fiction novel, it tells the story of a 15 year-old boy who struggles to learn his true identity. Given the youthful audience it targets, it is at least unconventional film-making and a think-piece for  young minds who would enjoy a more intellectual slice of drama. For all it's youthfullness though, it is a dark and grim plotline and adults may be troubled by the lead character's predicament and psychological well-being. Apparently there's something here that young teenagers will absorb. Robert Wagner is very stiff and lifeless in the role of the boy's psychiatrist and Hope Lange plays an incidental character even less significant than her role as the doomed wife of Charles Bronson in ""Death Wish"". If nothing else, ""I Am The Cheese"" is unique.",996278400,4,1055,5.169590643274854
7839915,1,6303139663,"This is a great movie, one of my all-time favorites. I was so looking forward to seeing it on DVD. Unfortunately, it's a disaster of a product. The print is TERRIBLE. The contrast is awful. The color is poor. Even the FOCUS is bad. There are moments mid-film when the bottom edge has an annoying digital flicker. And to top it all off, it's full-screen. What a disappointment. This film deserves better.",1403654400,2,403,4.611111111111111
7839916,5,6303139663,"I have never been chased by a group of criminals who hated me and my family for someone testifying against them on capitol hill. However, I have felt that there were mysterious things in my life that I just could not explain and that I have also felt like I would get in trouble for asking about them, and after researching these thing I have still feel an emptiness inside that just does not add up.

I have also known many girls in High School just like Amy Hertz who treated me about the same as she did Adam.

This movie for some reason more than others has impacted me made me look a things differently than I would have otherwise.

The lower quality audio, the dated film grain and the obvious 80s look of the film actually give it some charm.

The Vermont scenery is beautiful. You can almost taste the humidity in the air and the constant light rain that accompanies that part of the country.

You can really feel the confusion in Adam.

That all being said, this is not a movie that you want to watch at a big get together or give as a gift to your mother on Mother's day but a good movie to watch when you are sick or when there quiet Saturday night when you are by yourself or just you and your significant other. Something that really makes you think and rethink.",1399507200,,1275,4.24793388429752
7839917,5,6303139663,"I first encountered this title as a book by Robert Cormier. As always, it is difficult to translate a book into a movie, but the producers did an excellent job considering the limitations of cinema. The twist in the plot at the end, while not as strong as in the book, delivers considerable impact. If the viewer likes this movie, he/she might like to view the movie version of The Bumblebee Flies Anyway, based on another of Cormier's books, starring Elijah Wood. Now, if they would only make a movie version of After the First Death. . . .",1393459200,,541,4.474747474747475

This movie was made in 1983, and it is dated. The color is a bit faded, and the sound quality is not up to today's standards. However, it is well worth ignoring these simple realities. There is an excellent movie here.

I had read this psychological thriller by Robert Cormier. I was very eager to see the movie, because I could not imagine how the producer and director would portray the essence of this book and maintain the secret significance of the plot. This film did not disappoint me. Powerfully done, it delivered Cormier's message with a punch!",1370131200,,821,4.815602836879433
7839919,5,6303139663,"This is a wonderful, warm, tender film that is very enjoyable.  Filmed in the early 80's, it's pacing may seem slow at times compared to the ultra-sleek, CGI rehashes being released today, but this movie has charm and feeling and a persona all its own that shouldn't be rushed.  The scenery is incredibly beautiful, and Robert MacNaughton gives a fine performance as the main character, Adam Farmer.  Adam is searching for his father and receiving psychiatric treatment as he tries to recall the buried memories of his past.  No one around him seems to be able to offer any substantial help as he presses on to discover the painful truth awaiting him.  Twist ending.  Based on the book by Robert Cormier.  Robert MacNaughton sure did a lot of bicycle riding in his film career! :)",1363046400,,780,4.733333333333333
7839920,4,6303139663,"Robert MacNaughton brings considerable charm and integrity to the role of a nerdy, geeky teen with issues. This is probably the best portrayal of a teenager in film prior to River Phoenix's brilliant performance in RUNNING ON EMPTY. (With which this film shares a certain similarity of subject matter.)In a way, he carries the whole film.
Hope Lange and Don Murray are not given much to do as MacNaughton's parents, and their acting is somewhat cliched. Robert Wagner as a psychiatrist who may or may not be in sympathy with the boy, is somewhat better.
There is a fine score by Jonathan Tunick, and the Vermont and Massachusetts locations are gorgeous.",1341446400,,653,4.891891891891892

7839922,4,6303139663,"Robert McNaughton does a nice job here as Adam, a young man trying to unlock secrets of his past which are locked away inside his own mind.  There are also beautiful Vermont locations and a decent list of supporting cast members.  The only drawback here is the excessive use of long tracking shots, mostly of Adam riding his bike all over the place.  There is a twist related to this which we do not discover until it is almost at the end of the film.
