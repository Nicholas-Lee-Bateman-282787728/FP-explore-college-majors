2675600,4,B000JLTRLS,"My 5-year old daughter just loves anything ""My Little Pony"".  She has the ""Lily Lightly"" pony so this DVD, which features Lily, is a great addition to her collection.  The length is perfect, about 45 minutes.  Although I haven't timed it, I believe the second and third stories are shorter than the first, but my daughter doesn't mind.  It features some great new, very catchy songs, which I find myself singing as well...!  Yes, I'm a dad.  There's nothing in terms of bonus features except two sing-alongs, but she loves the whole thing.",1170892800,6,539,4.741935483870968
2675601,3,B000JLTRLS,"Took my Niece to our local theater to see a screening of Very Pony Place this weekend.  The story is bookended by one of the ponies reading stories to three younger ponies.  The three stories she reads make up the bulk of the film.  Each story is about 15 minutes and they each contain little lessons about friendship, being yourself, and embracing the things that make you unique.  At most times it can be a little too much sugar for the adults but the kids will enjoy it and maybe pick up a lesson or two along the way. Harmless Fun.",1169251200,10,535,4.267326732673268

2675653,4,B000JLTRLS,"This dvd was very cute. My 5 year old daughter loves it. It is a very nice show, not dark at all like the ones made in the 1980's.",1269561600,,130,3.5172413793103448
2675654,4,B000JLTRLS,My daughter is very happy that she got this in her Easter basket. She loves ponies and she likes to watch this while having ALL her ponies surrounding her.,1240963200,,155,4.379310344827586
2675655,5,B000JLTRLS,"My two youngest girls, 3 and 6, love this video.  The three stories on it are well written and are interesting to watch.  The problem with at least our copy is that when you hit ""play all"" it does not play them all in the right sequence so the closing credits appear after the first story which is supposed to be the last story.  It will throw kids off at first, and maybe parents too, but once we discovered what was happening we have been fine with it.",1229040000,,454,4.136363636363637
2675656,5,B000JLTRLS,"My four-year old is ""pony"" crazed.  This is much better quality than the TV series on DVD. My daughter likes them too, but they are low quality.  We have worn this DVD out.  Great for your little pony lover.",1226534400,,207,4.256410256410256
2675657,3,B000JLTRLS,"Not truly educational, but the ponies are all very nice to eachother, which teaches some social skills and gives some fun girlie entertainment.",1215216000,2,143,5.260869565217392
2675658,4,B000JLTRLS,"This is actually three Pony episodes on one DVD.  The first, Come Back Lily Lightly is about a Unicorn from Unicornia who's horn lights up when she giggles.  This causes her much embarrassment and she runs away for fear of being different.  Sounds familiar?  This is the old Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer story of acceptance, given a pony glossing.  Cute, but unoriginal.

The second story is Two for the Sky about two ponies who want nothing more than to fly.  This teaches the moral that its often best just being yourself and being content with who you are and what you have.  Dreams are often best left to dreams.

The third story is Pinkie Pie's Positively Pink.  Pinkie has a birthday coming up and her friends want to surprise her by painting the town...Pink!  Its a story of friendship and not much else.

The animation is nice, very vibrant and colorful, the stories are standard fare, nothing great.  Some of the songs stick out and are memorable singalongs.  Unfortunately this DVD does NOT come with extra episodes like the previous two did.  So all you get is the three Pony shorts lasting about 45 minutes total.

I thought it was OK kind of cute and decent lessons about being a friend.  My daughter loved it and watched it four times in a row the first time she had it.  I can safely say that its a clean DVD with little conflict and absolutely nothing ""scary"" or objectionable and is suitable for any age.",1180224000,17,1422,4.531496062992126
2675659,5,B000JLTRLS,this is a cute and sweet movie for all little girls. My daughter loves little pony and this movie is just another one to her ever growing collection.,1175558400,,149,4.357142857142857

2675661,5,B000JLTRLS,"The songs are nice and the stories are great.  Come Back Lily Lightly makes me feel happy when I watch it.  The shows are the perfect length.  Sometimes I sing a long with the shows.  Out of every My Little Pony shows I own,(which is all of them) this one is my favorite.  This reveiw is by my 6-year old daughter.",1172102400,6,314,4.081967213114754

8151748,1,B000JLTRLS,I've tried buying this movie twice now. And every time I try to play it each time in my blu ray player or PS3 it freezes up and skips a lot of content. Always happens on the episode about Pinkie Pie's surprise party or during the episode about the ponies that want to fly. It's not my player either. All other DVDs and blu rays play just fine.,1496880000,,343,4.0588235294117645
8151749,4,B000JLTRLS,"This DVD is the seventh in the direct-to-video ""Generation 3"" My Little Pony series; it contains the episodes ""Come Back, Lily Lightly"", ""Two For the Sky"", and""Positively Pink"".

MLP G3 is set in a world where there is very little danger, and ponies almost always get along with one another; as such it will primarily appeal to very young children. Despite this, the writing is fairly good most of the time, with fun characters and a lot of clever dialog. The art is so bright and colorful it may overwhelm some adults, but its also well done.

The three episodes on this DVD are all short and as such do not have the time to show much character depth or build any tension. Even so, anyone who found the earlier episodes in the Generation 3 series enjoyable should enjoy this DVD as well.",1459555200,,788,4.503496503496503

8151756,1,B000JLTRLS,"This video has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.

I love watching all sorts of cartoons with the kids, but not this DVD.  There is no story, no laughs, no life lessons, and no entertainment value.  Worst of all is the girls-just-wanna-have-fun attitude of the whole thing.  I'm by no means a feminazi, but I find this video demeaning to little girls.  It's like the writers decided, ""hey just throw pink ponies on the screen and add lots of giggling.""

If you want your daughter to grow up with no ambition or interests other than giggling and the color pink, then this DVD is for you.",1309219200,,586,4.586538461538462
