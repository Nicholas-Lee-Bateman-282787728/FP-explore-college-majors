4898319,5,B005W2BWDA,"I bought this set of DVDs because I have just gotten into watching shows like this, so I thought I would catch a glimpse of Bourdain: The Early Years.  Overall I was very pleased with this set, and I found that Tony hasn't lost an ounce of his spunk, and/or his aptitude to seek out good, quality food.  I contacted Questar about the issue with disc 6, and I received a replacement promptly. I easily forget about issues like that when they are taken care of by those who made the mistake. Keep up the good work Tony!",1331856000,,517,4.26530612244898
4898320,4,B005W2BWDA,"A couple of things: Yes, disc six is missing an episode, but Questar is aware of the problem and has replacement discs ready to go.  Simply call them at 312-266-9400 to arrange it.

Second, due to an encoding issue the episodes stretch to widescreen on widescreen monitors.  Simply change your settings to force 4:3 to correct this.

Other than these two correctable issues, it's just great to finally have this on DVD!",1330646400,25,419,4.777777777777778
4898321,1,B005W2BWDA,"Well, I too found this at Target (just today) and made a spur-of-the-moment purchase. Getting it home I discovered that while the show, which was originally broadcast in full screen (4:3 aspect ratio), someone at Questar stretched it into widescreen 16:9, making everyone look flat. And no, it's not my TV or DVD player, which automatically adjusts for these things (but can be set manually to the correct aspect ratio if need be).

Not really surprising when even broadcast and cable networks can't even get these things right. The first few seasons of ""No Reservations"" were also 4:3, and then they changed to 16:9. The first time Travel Channel broadcast the Cleveland episode (16:9), they broadcast it wrong as 4:3.

So unless you like watching incorrectly squeezed pictures (hey,Tony looks all of 5'7""), avoid this badly made DVD set like the plague.

I'm returning mine tomorrow for a refund - maybe some day (but probably not) someone will release it correctly.

P.S.: Maybe the reason they're so cheap at Target is that Questar realised their mistake and dumped all the bad copies there...",1328659200,9,1097,4.978142076502732
4898322,3,B005W2BWDA,"You can definitely see the genesis for No Reservations in these episodes (as well as familiar figures like Zamir, Michael Ruhlman, Eric Ripert, Linh, and others who show up later in No Reservations), and any fan of No Res should like Cook's Tour.

My biggest complaint ... is why is Amazon selling this set for $50, when you can go to Target and buy the same set for $20?  I'm so glad I read the other review, because I was going to order this from Amazon.  Instead, I ran over to Target, and bought it for the cheaper price!

If you like Tony, go get this set ... just get it somewhere cheaper!",1327795200,11,595,4.238938053097345
4898323,4,B005W2BWDA,"I first stumbled upon Anthony Bourdain's writing a couple years after his magnum opus on the food service industry,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kitchen-Confidential-Updated-Edition-Adventures-in-the-Culinary-Underbelly-P-S/dp/0060899220/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kitchen Confidential Updated Edition: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly (P.S.)</a>, was released and quickly became a fan of his very 70s punk view of what it's like to work the line and run a restaurant.  When I heard that he was writing his next book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Cook-s-Tour-Global-Adventures-in-Extreme-Cuisines/dp/0060012781/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Cook's Tour: Global Adventures in Extreme Cuisines</a>, as well as filming a television show to back it up I was very excited and intrigued by the concept.  In a nutshell, Bourdain traveled the globe stopping off in places that have either had a profound affect on him culturally (such as visiting Vietnam because of films like Apocalypse Now) or on his culinary proclivities (such as visiting the hometown of his longtime employer in Portugal or the spot of his first childhood food epiphany in France.)  Along the way he does his best to completely open himself up to any available gastronomical experiences which can at times be weird, exciting, or downright disgusting (like eating the still-beating heart of a cobra or trying barbequed lizard on a stick.)

The television series, which ran for two seasons back around the turn of the millennium, was at the time some of the most interesting programming on the Food Network focusing more on real life and a wide variety of cultural experiences (as opposed to the typical shows which center on short-cut cooking and product placement.)  Though Bourdain has a hearty sense of humor and charisma that could easily place him among the ranks of the other Food Network celebrity chefs, it quickly became clear during the second season that (which featured travel beyond the scope of the original book and concept) he was under heavy pressure from the network to ""get in-line"" with their outlook and direction content-wise as he was visiting places (like the Mall of America), where it's obvious he does not want to be.  Luckily, he stepped away from the show and the network and found a home elsewhere where he's free to make the content he wants to.

Pop culture-wise, this series is probably best known for introducing the public to the idea of extremely weird eating (bugs, lizards, cobras, you name it), but that's only on the surface.  The heart of the show is really about digging into other cultures and opening oneself up to trying all kinds of cuisine.

As for the DVD set, I was surprised when I found a copy up at my local Target as I thought this series was stuck in a Food Network limbo.  The packaging was alarming in it's poor production design quality, but at twenty bucks I thought it was worth a glance to see if the actually DVD picture and sound quality was decent.  Besides, I never expected the series would be released so I figured I better snag a copy before it disappeared.  All in all, it's not that bad, quality-wise, with a 8 out of 10 on picture and 7 out of 10 on sound quality.  To be honest, it's been so long since I saw it in its original run that this might be more or less how it originally aired.  My main complaint with the set is that it's presented in a six disc set that's broken up disc by disc into world regions (US, Mexico & the Americas, Europe, Morocco & Russia, Asia, and Australia & Japan) instead of being set up in either production or air-date order.  So it's hard to figure out what is the first and second season.  I guess for those really intrigued by the series it's well worth picking up the first book and doing your best to use it as a guide to the first season.",1326758400,15,3908,5.1114599686028255

4898347,5,B005W2BWDA,"This is a very nice set and it was even better than I had hoped for. I did get one of the sets with a bad disc but a simple phone call and a replacement was at my door in a few days. It is really great to see how Anthony started his now incredible career as not only a Chef and Television host but a very good writer. I have been a fan for a long time and I am happy to see him get the attention he deserves. His current show ""Parts Unknown""on CNN shows how is only getting better at what he does. I use his shows as a way to gauge the quality of show that attempt to do what he does. I am looking forward to seeing where he takes us next.",1405296000,6,639,3.6715328467153285
4898348,5,B005W2BWDA,Love everything about this. It has all all 35 episodes of the show in 6 CDs with each one focusing on a specific area of the world that Bourdain visited. My only dislike is that it doesn't offer subtitles.,1396569600,,205,4.282051282051282
4898349,5,B005W2BWDA,"When I ordered this item, I assumed it would be a couple DVDs with maybe a few hours of shows on them.  I was wrong.  The box is massive (for a DVD set) and filled with slim-case DVDs.  For the price, I couldn't believe what I got.  I'm a huge Anthony Bourdain fan, so I was very happy with what I got.",1384905600,9,302,3.8225806451612905
4898350,5,B005W2BWDA,"Cooking shows are my passion.  Travel is my avocation.  Put them together with a host as interesting and personable as Anthony Bourdain and you've got yourself a winner.  It seems Tony is open to just about anything you throw at him but is always polite and kind to his hosts and guides.

In this day of big mouth, rude cooking entertainers it is refreshing to watch a well-mannered gentleman traveling the world and showing us the cuisine of many cultures.  I highly recommend this series.",1383436800,,490,4.7176470588235295
4898351,5,B005W2BWDA,A younger gangly Tony sets the international table to his later successes. Nice to watch since these are not broadcast on TV . The early wit and chain smoking keep every episode moving along briskly.,1374192000,,199,4.714285714285714

4898353,5,B005W2BWDA,"Anthony Bourdain was riding high with the success of his memoir Kitchen Confidential when he pitched the idea of traveling the world in search of the perfect meal and writing about it to his publisher.  To his amazement they bought the idea but came back with the plan to also have his adventures filmed for broadcast on the Food Network.  Mr. Bourdain had been super critical of celebrity chefs, so it was not without heavy irony that he went along with plan.  He referred to it as selling out and lucky for us he did.  A Cook's Tour and his follow-up series No Reservations are among the finest shows made for television.  Mr. Bourdain has a wry and sardonic nature that comes across perfectly on the small screen. For those who love No Reservations, A Cook's Tour episodes are only a half-hour and they are mainly about Mr. Bourdain's search for food and less about the social environment than No Reservations.  The main complaint I have about the set is that group the episodes by region they were filmed in as opposed to chronological order.  While each episode stands on its own and can really be watched in any order, it would have been nice to have it chronically to watch the series in its correct order if you so desired.",1333497600,2,1231,4.542986425339366
8487785,5,B005W2BWDA,"Like another buyer, I had a problem with one of the disks. If I selected a certain episode from the menu, it would play a different episode.
