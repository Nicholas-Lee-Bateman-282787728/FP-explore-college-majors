4428681,5,B004M64QSK,"wheelie was my  favorite cartoon growing up, it was a real blast watching them again for the first time, thanks",1379203200,,111,4.55
4428682,5,B004M64QSK,"I have enjoyed seeing these after many years and have gotten my kids hooked on them, too.  The stories are not spectacular and one would have to be a fan of motorcycles constantly trying to ruin a Herbie-like car's day to enjoy this.  Certainly not as polished as Cars, but it was just a Saturday Morning cartoon.  The DVDs have worked well for me, despite their ""burn on demand"" status.",1356134400,,387,4.5
4428683,5,B004M64QSK,I rated this five because.i love this cartoon.old but still good.watched when i was a kid.good then.still good now. kids will love it,1356134400,,133,4.826086956521739
4428684,5,B004M64QSK,This cartoon is very funny and cool you have vechlies talking each other and my favorite is the chopper bunch.,1354752000,,110,4.55
4428685,5,B004M64QSK,"Got this for my two sons, ages 2.5 and and 10. It was a huge hit with the youngest. He loves anything with a motor to play with so a cartoon with talking motorcycles and such really scored big. He loves repeating the line ""I told ya! I told ya!"" My oldest son hasn't had time to watch it with us yet. I'm sure he'll dig it just as much as I did when I was a young'en.",1345507200,,367,3.717948717948718
4428686,5,B004M64QSK,"What attracted me to Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch was the fact I saw it in reruns when I was a young child, and I wanted to see it again - this time with the understanding of what was going on.  Watched it...LOVED IT!  I often find myself chuckling every time one of Chopper's plans backfires and Scrambles rubs it in with his ""I told ya!  I told ya!"" bit.  It was well worth the money I spent to get it.",1332288000,,405,3.962962962962963
4428687,1,B004M64QSK,"NOTE: I RETURNED both Speed Buggy and Wheelie & The Chopper Bunch. Speedy came in playable condition. Wheelie has to go back. Disc two has fingerprints on it and it looks like it was rubbed on a table. This disc is the worst of both shipments. WT Heck is going on? Wheelie has to go BACK to Amazon.com. The second shipment came just a day after I shipped both sets back to Amazon.com. I'm waiting until at least tomorrow to send Wheelie back 3 hrs to Orlando, Florida.

On a positive note, Speed Buggy has brought back many good memories. The little dune buggy car is adorable. Love that little car and his sputtering voice and ""Room a Zoom Zoom"". The cartoon was no frills but the little talking car is great fun almost forty years later. It's GREAT that Hanna Barbara resurrected this cute cartoon.

*****************************************************************************************************************

I ordered ""Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch"" and ""Speed Buggy"" from Amazon.com. The two items came together in a box from Amazon. The dvd boxes were sealed with plastic so I thought everything would be just fine. Well, I was WRONG. Both sets have CIRCULAR SCRATCHES on them. Them have these SCRATCHES due to POOR and CHEAP design. To save MONEY the manufacturer put a SWINGING DUAL DVD retainer in both boxes. Wheelie is a three disc set and Speed is a FOUR disc set. The sets are the same size as a normal SINGLE disc box. The SWINGING DUAL DVD RETAINER allowed the discs to SPIN in place. Since the discs are mounted back to back in an offset position the design left a perforated area in the plastic where the retainer ring sits. So the delicate back side of the disc was pushed into the hard plastic perforation causing circular scratches. So both sets have scratches. This set also will not play on my cheap Samsung DVD recorder/vhs player. So I need to either watch these CARTOONS on my computer or I need to buy another dvd player. The design of the discs is not the standard dvd format. I ran into this format before with the tv movie about Ted Bundy called ""The Deliberate Stranger"". I had to watch that dvd set on the computer. At least that movie did not arrive with scratches.

4428688,4,B004M64QSK,"I'm sure most everyone reading this remembers those great Hanna Barbera cartons of the 60's and 70's.  Looking at them now, I think most of them hold up pretty well.  The animation wasn't exactly groundbreaking, and hasn't really aged well.  But as a kid, we didn't care about stuff like that.  HB's Saturday morning lineup was full of colorful, FUN cartoons with excellent voice work.

Wheelie and the Chopper bunch never got the respect of the other talking-car series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Speed-Buggy/dp/B004K5RN2O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Speed Buggy</a>, but it's still a good cartoon.  I only wish it had lasted longer; the complete series is only comprised of 13 episodes (although, technically, there are 3 shorts per episode so you get a total of 39 separate stories).

As with other recent Warner ""manufactured on demand"" titles, the quality is very good.  Even without digital remastering, the drawings are sharp and the colors are bright.  Some behind-the-scenes features would have been appreciated, but sadly there is nothing like that here.  The studio is clearly aiming for adult collectors with these somewhat high-priced nostalgic titles; surely they must realize we grown-up kids would like some bonus material.  But if you have fond memories of Wheelie, Chopper and the gang, you really will want to add this to your collection.",1315958400,14,1405,5.580188679245283
4428689,5,B004M64QSK,Wheelie was CARS before anyone thought of CARS.I remember getting up on Sat. and turn Wheelie on and laugh at the Chopper Bunch trying to get Wheelie. Cartoons like this too not exist anymore. I wish that they would make cartoons like this now.,1305504000,5,244,4.568181818181818
4428690,5,B004M64QSK,"Hanna-Barbera's world of talking cars & cycles is humorous and timeless, and Wheelie's adventures are colorful.  If you fondly remember these shows when they aired, as I do, it's nice to own all the episodes and share them with all ages.",1304467200,7,237,4.780487804878049

8435571,3,B004M64QSK,"Item was received as pictured/described with no problems.  The only issue I have is that this show is not how I remembered it as a child... i.e. it has not held up well over the years.  The animation itself is very crudely drawn and the story line and the show in general is meant for a very young audience.  If you're looking to add old Saturday morning cartoons to your collection, skip this one and stick with shows like the pink panther, Sigmund and the sea monsters, Hong Kong phooey, Land of the lost, etc.",1431907200,,512,4.368421052631579
