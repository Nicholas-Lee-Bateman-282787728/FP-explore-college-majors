8036032,1,B0003OHLBO,"I do not recommend buying this collection of goals, for various reasons:
1) It does not contain *any* of the goals that Maradona scored with Argentina's national team, so it does not contain the famous goal that he scored against England in Mexico'86, always voted the best goal of all times, or the famous ""hand of God"" goal.
2) It contains only two or three goals of the dozens that he scored with FC Barcelona. The ones chosen are not even the best ones, since it misses the famous dribble to SanJose's Real Madrid player by the post and the beautiful loop against Estrella Roja. I missed these particularly, because I'm from Barcelona and I was going to the stadium when I was growing up to see Diego and I wanted to have those. The DVD advertisement says clearly that it contains ""goals with FC Barcelona"" -- yeah right. Three?
3) A lot of the goals are repeated several times, as if the viewer is stupid or what. I'm not even sure if there are 120 goals here. I paid for a DVD called ""120 best goals by Diego"" and the one I got says ""120 goals by Diego"". Obviously it's a scam.
4) The goals are centered mostly on his career at Boca Juniors and Napoli, and there is an excess (over 30) uninteresting penalty kicks. Ridiculous.",1282694400,,1232,4.407894736842105
8036033,4,B0003OHLBO,"The movie showed excerpts of Maradona's marvelous play. I would have given it 5 stars but the work was poorly edited with several play sequences repeated and some sections switching between English and spanish. Clearly the movie is a montage of clips from a wide range of sources so one can forgive the changing video quality.  Nonetheless, the plays covered are very entertaining and show that Maradona was indeed extravagantly talented and one of the greatest players of this century (though I think Pele was slightly superior).",1205971200,3,530,5.091954022988506
