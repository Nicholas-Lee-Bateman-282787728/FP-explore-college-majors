5932679,3,B00EPH8S8U,"I have been doing Leslie's workouts since 2008 and have lost weight doing them, but truthfully I do HIIT with turbo fire so I was waiting for the HIIT to begin. I give it three stars it was okay but the music was not great although I will give it a thumbs up for MC Hammer and the Party Rock song, but Dancing on the Ceiling by Lionel Richie is not a great song to work out to and neither is the Go-Go's .Love Leslie but she needs a musical director for her walking dvds. Someone who can maybe have more of today's music rather than what she had (and I was a teenager in the 80's). Needless to say I was little disappointed with this one because I was expecting more upbeat music. Sorry but giving it three stars out of five for effort. Hoping the next dvd has better music.",1386547200,4,774,4.098684210526316
5932680,3,B00EPH8S8U,"This is an ok workout, but it isn't really for me.  I only recognized two songs - We Got the Beat and Can't Touch This.  The HIIT cycles only last about 30 seconds, I was hoping for longer intervals. I had barely started to break a sweat at the 25 minute mark. There are the usual kick backs, side steps, knee lifts and kicks; there is also a lot of bouncing and fist pumping.  There are also some skaters and walk three-tap on four, and heels down; a few steps I couldn't get my feet to do, the walk forward/back and tap, and the side steps with turns.  I also didn't care for the fact that most of the ladies put their own dance-y twist on the moves, it was a little distracting to me.  I did stick with it for the whole workout, and it did feel good to have gotten up and moved, but this one won't get much play.  I much prefer Leslie's other interval workout, the 4 Mile Power Walk.  I like to feel like I have had a good workout, and yes this one did make me move, but I didn't feel like I got the workout I wanted or expected with this.",1386547200,8,1042,3.980769230769231
5932681,4,B00EPH8S8U,"While I do like this workout, I feel it did not raise my heart rate  long enough to be truly effective.  Even though it was three miles it went way too fast.  I was waiting for it to begin... and it was over.  I like the fact that Leslie is putting more moves into her workouts, trying her hand at hiit training, but the interval changes are too abrupt,  I hope her future efforts are smoother.  Still it was fun and the music  was upbeat and pretty well done for remixes.  4 stars from me.",1386460800,8,490,4.08421052631579
5932682,5,B00EPH8S8U,"Leslie's new DVD is very similar in format to her recent Walk to the Hits Radio Remixes.  It has the same studio, and most of the same cast, and the 3 mile walk is a very similar format.  I like the variety of moves and the energy of the walk.  Leslie mixes up her traditional 4 walk moves with lots of other variations (skaters, high knees, heels down, kick backs) and includes arm movements to keep your heart rate up.  Each mile is 12 - 13 minutes with a 5 minute warm up and a 5 minute cool down and stretch.  Towards the end of the 1st mile, Leslie begins 4 cycles of HIIT intervals, which have a slower walk followed by a 30 second HIIT of jogging at higher intensity.  I think Leslie slows things down too much in anticipation of the HIIT and the actual higher intensity could go longer than 30 seconds, but it works to keep you moving through the whole 3 miles.  The miles are separately chaptered on the DVD, but there is no real separation between the miles so this seems like one to do all at once to me.

Overall, this is an energetic walk with lots of variety and some fun music.  The music alternates between a song with vocals and a straight instrumental.  The vocal music includes the following:  'We Got The Beat'; 'Party Rock Anthem'; 'U Can't Touch This'; 'Dancing On the Ceiling'.

*** Update:  Just did this again and had to add an additional star!  It's a fun workout that keeps you moving.  The moves are varied so there is no boredom--just a fun, high-energy workout driven by catchy music!",1386374400,13,1514,4.338078291814947
5932683,5,B00EPH8S8U,"I gave this DVD to my Sister.  It was the first time she had ever tried a Leslie Sansone DVD and she is HOOKED.  She told me to be sure and say how much fun and up beat this was.  She has done it 5 times already and loves the HIIT that gets her heart pumping.  She does the whole 3 miles and enjoys every bit of it.
 No matter if you are young or old, you will have fun with the Just Walk ~ Walk to the Hits Party Songs",1385337600,9,419,3.5604395604395602
5932684,4,B00EPH8S8U,"I didn't really like Leslie's Walk to the Hits (Radio Remixes) at first, but it grew on me after a while, so I decided to give this one a try as well. It's good to use for an easier day (I usually do TurboFire, but this is a nice break from all that high impact). This walk is pretty much just a variation of Radio Remixes: it's the same background, about 90% of the same people, and the same cardio-""hit"" cycle from before.

The workout breakdown looks like this:

Warm-up for 5 minutes, then 5 minutes of very fast walking and jogging. ""Hit"" starts at 10 minutes. These cycles consist of about 2 minutes of recovery, then about 30 seconds of hit. Personally, I think the recovery is too long and brings my heart rate down too much, so I bump up the intensity during the recovery to keep my heart rate up a little. This might be ideal for someone not used to high intensity exercise, though. At 15 minutes, you've done a mile. ""Hit"" continues until about 22 minutes, then you go into regular cardio. At 29 minutes, you've done the 2nd mile. At around 37 minutes, there is one last little ""Hit"", then you start the cool down walk and stretch. The stretch is actually pretty thorough. After the stretch, the 3rd mile marker pops up. I still think that's cheating just a little to count the stretch in the walk. I think to make it a true 3 mile walk, the walk should be for 45 minutes, then the stretch. But that's just me.

I like Leslie a lot. She is a wonderful, sweet instructor. Because of this, I want to do her workouts, even though they're not as intense as other stuff I have done, so I change up some stuff to make the workout more intense for me. Some of the ways that I add more intensity is to use more arms than Leslie instructs you to do. I also do knee lifts during the walk-walk-walk-taps (walk-walk-walk-knee). Another move that I modify is tap outs - I do cross punches. Also, I use a 3 lbs pair of walking weights. After doing her walks for a while, I've learned how to modify her moves to fit my needs, and now I like them better.

As for the party songs, they are songs most people should know: ""We Got The Beat""(by The Go Gos - this is the song that plays during the ""Hits""); ""Party Rock Anthem""(by LMFAO); ""U Can't Touch This""(by MC Hammer); ""Dancing On the Ceiling""(by Lionel Richie). One thing that bothers me is the few seconds of silence in between songs. I think they should have ran the songs closer together than that so that you're not just walking with no music for that time.

This is a pretty fun workout that is filmed well. The background is colorful, the ""walkers"" (even though I think some of them are really dancers) look like they are having fun, Leslie seems to be enjoying herself.

PS: I ordered this from a different website, so I got it before Amazon released it. I've already ordered another copy from Amazon for a friend's Christmas present.",1385078400,180,2887,4.346938775510204

What I liked about this DVD:
1) There were some new variations to the core moves that I hadn't done before.
2) I am generally a fan of interval training and this video has it.
3) I sweat. It challenged me more than some of her previous videos.

What I didn't like:
1) The music selections were a bit of a let down. They songs you know only play at key times and the rest of the time is just nondescript. So, a bit misleading there.
2) 1 or 2 of the new moves felt awkward.",1470182400,,680,3.8156028368794326

5932768,5,B00EPH8S8U,"Admittedly I did not buy this from Amazon but I had to review it. This is a 3 mile workout total. I am back into exercise, I made it through the first 2 miles. What's not to love about walking with Leslie Sansone? I've bought her DVDs for years. She has a lighthearted, non-judgmental approach. But in this one, she includes 30 seconds of high intensity interval training in addition to walking. And just like she says, it's over before you know it. 30 seconds I can do! I added 3 pound weights for more of a challenge & I really enjoyed it. The camera periodically shows people who are working out with her really getting into the music too! As someone who prefers working out at home (I sometimes have 2 left feet!) this is one of my favorites. As Leslie is always kind enough to say, it doesn't matter if you're using the opposite foot. What counts is you're moving!",1466467200,,869,4.37037037037037

I don't think the HITT portions are anywhere near what most of us are capable of, but dang it, I always have fun and work up a sweat.

5932782,5,B00EPH8S8U,"Walk to the Hits Party Songs and Walk to the Hits Remix are 2 of my favorite Leslie Sansone DVDs and I have about 15 of hers. I love the music and even the instrumental music that she uses between the songs. I feel like I get a great workout. After you have done this workout many times like I have, you can always give it an additional boost by wearing weighted gloves or adding little hops, etc. I get a great workout  just by doing the workout itself but their are options if you need a little something more. I love Leslie and for the most part, there isn't any annoying walkers on this DVD with exception to one that feels like she needs to sing the entire song every time the vocal music plays which gets on my nerves a bit, but you might not even notice it. I hope Leslie continues to make these HIIT DVDs with popular, familiar songs because I would buy everyone of them. Love it! Highly recommend it if you are trying to shed pounds and change your body. I have been doing Leslie and Jessica Smith's walking DVD for the past several months. Though I have seen the numbers on the scale drop a bit, I can tell my body is changing by the way my clothes are fitting. I also received 2 compliments last week from co-workers commenting on me losing weight. 95% of my exercise is from walk at home DVD's. Give it a try!

She is very motivational. I usually have a hard time getting motivated to begin exercising. I've been enjoying one other of her videos, which was appropriate for my level. It's what I would consider the beginner. I was doing so well with that one, I was able to pick up some weights. When I received this one, I did not have to pick up weights. I can become quite lazy at times, but when I decide not to exercise (weekends), I can here the music and her voice.... it makes me want to do it on weekends. Oh my",1454544000,,685,4.119402985074627

I thought I was going to be disappointed when she did the first interval, only 30 seconds, but I was really surprised at the end of this DVD I was definitely out of breath and sweating.  It didn't feel like one of her regular DVDs but more of an aerobics class that I could do.  I'm putting this into my regular rotation.

5932810,5,B00EPH8S8U,"I use this DVD once, maybe twice a week.  Most of the week I do weight/strength training, but I do cardio about 3 times a week.  I tend to choose this video after my at-home shoulders strength training.

My background: I have a slipped disc in my back and had knee surgery.  I'm also overweight (currently 215 lbs) and I can do these without any issues.  For those that are more generous in the chest area, I would suggest getting a good cardio bra to hold everything in if you do this DVD as there are some jumping movements - but all for short periods of time.

I'm also able to do Leslie's videos in a smaller space than most living rooms, about 4x6 foot and I change my facing direction for the double side steps, etc.

This video is great for right after weight lifting at home (such as after shoulders, or biceps/triceps).  I don't always do the entire video, but end it after 30 min. One of the better Leslie Sansone workouts in my collection.",1449360000,,950,4.327683615819209

5932812,5,B00EPH8S8U,"I have used these for several months now. They are well put together. The only thing I would caution against is, that for mature people, the added strength training while walking might be problematic because of balance issues and concentration. I am 66 and don't do them .... just the walking. I do strength and flexibility excercises after the walk because of being really  warmed up and concentrating on one thing at a time. In this way I am less likely to injure myself.",1448755200,2,473,4.630952380952381

I have almost every walking workout she's done and this is one of my least favorite maybe because the music isn't as inspiring and fun as the title would imply and it's also one that she talks way too much on. You can watch without her talking which I prefer. You get an okay workout but not much different that her other workouts.

Leslie stop the chatter because you can't keep the beat and talk ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL the time.

In addition, her final stretching needs much improvement. Maybe she needs to check out Jessica Simpson or another walk instructor to see how their do final stretching. We hit a lot of muscles during Leslie's workouts especially in this 3 mile but the tiny amount of stretching she gives us needs much more improvement.

The warm up and final stretching can be changed a bit; it gets old.

At least this dvd was fun and great music was a must and Leslie hit it with this one. All ages can appreciate the music.",1447804800,,856,4.426751592356688

5932832,4,B00EPH8S8U,"The music is great and makes this excercise routine a lot of fun, I look forward to doing this one.  BUT, don't expect a great workout here.  I'm 45 years old and am an advanced walker, having used Leslie's DVD's for about 5 years daily to help me maintain my weight and stay in shape.  They've sure done that!  I own about 20 of her DVD's but this one I usually use mid-week on days that are real busy and I don't have time to work up a good sweat and have to shower and re-do my make-up...  No matter how hard I work out on this one, I can't break a sweat.  I might get a little warm, that's about the extent of it.  The main issue is that the HIIT's are only 30 seconds long, so even lifting me knees nearly to my chin in the jog, it's just not long enough for me to really get my heart rate up.  This in combination with the fact that the segments between the HIITS are too slow, designed to get your heart rate down, I just can't get a real good workout with this one.  That said, you don't need to go full tilt every day with excercise routine's, variety is the thing.  I still use the DVD and look forward to it.  So I recommend this DVD to beginner's who are looking to boost their workouts by trying a little high intensity moves and for intermediate and advanced walkers who are looking for a fun but easier workout for mid-week.",1441670400,,1339,4.072519083969466

5932855,5,B00EPH8S8U,"The songs are upbeat. The group of walkers are enthusiastic. Leslie is her usual cheerful self. This a fun 3-mile walk! It's great to have the option to just walk to the music, without the voices. However, I find that the workout seems to go faster when listening to what's coming up next. The 3 miles are not ""equal miles"", since mile #1 includes the warm-up and mile #3 includes the cool down and stretch. The mile markers mark each 15-minute segment. I definitely recommend this dvd!",1436745600,,486,4.597701149425287

5932876,5,B00EPH8S8U,I use Leslie Sansone DVD's in inclement weather and needed something new as I was getting bored after using so many times.

5932878,2,B00EPH8S8U,"The songs were mostly - NOT - party songs with only a few being some upbeat popular songs. The rest were Sansone's traditional workout songs. I was NOT impressed with the clothing attire or the generation style the DVD ""talks to;"" workout shirt hanging off the shoulder, baggy/low riding pants, etc. Style and Image seemed to be a big factor in this DVD. I did like the HIIT workout itself, but that was about it.",1432684800,,413,4.52

5932896,1,B00EPH8S8U,"This tape is just OK at best!
I have many of Leslie's DVDs.  This is the first one that I really do not like.  The music is ok.  The moves are ok.  Leslie does include her signature 4 walking steps but they are used sparingly and are modified in ways I did not enjoy.  One of the things I have always liked about Leslie's workouts is that while they vary they are also consistent in their movements.  I know that exercise trends change but it felt like Leslie was trying too hard to attract a younger audience with this one.  There is running in place, bouncing up and down a lot, twisting of your body and knees to name a few new moves.  I know that as a middle aged person, these moves are not all easy on the joints.  Of course you can modify for yourself but then what is the point of spending good money on a workout DVD if I make my own moves up?!  The best part of this DVD is you can just listen to the music and not follow along with Leslie.  That is why I wish I would not have made this purchase!",1430524800,3,1007,3.985

Leslie & her crew throw in some new stuff it's all fun walking but you can get a really good workout using the fun moves.",1430265600,,266,3.8545454545454545
5932900,5,B00EPH8S8U,"NOTICE: If you don't like the way Leslie Sansone talks, keeps the beat, moves or breathes, STOP WATCHING HER WORKOUTS! Geez, if you watch one, you know her personality and her method. There are plenty of other workouts to choose from. Move on.
That being said, I love Leslie. Yes, she talks, Yes, she loses the beat sometimes. Yes, you do a lot of the same moves. BUT as someone who isn't coordinated enough to walk and chew gum at the same time, Leslie is a godsend. Predictable? Yep. Nothing too complicated? That's EXACTLY what I love about her and why I only do her workouts. This particular workout does have new moves and new concepts but because it's Leslie, she does it in a way that my two left feet can catch on. And even if I can't, all I have to do is walk to the beat until I do. I don't feel like the ugly duckling with the workout swans.
So you want hip or flashy? Move on. You want someone who will encourage you and help you get a good solid workout? Give Leslie a try.",1430179200,136,986,4.1947368421052635

Of course none are from the original artist. There are few more songs also.

5932925,3,B00EPH8S8U,"This is my 6th Leslie DVD, I needed something quick for rainy days to get my walk in.  This DVD is about 45 minutes and 3 miles.  Quick and to the point.
Pros:
It's quick.
It involves 4 fast hiit intervoles.
It's unlike any other in the sense of the moves.  Alot my fun-ish dance moves and alot of moving and hoping.

Cons:
The camera is in love with the terribly annoying girl to her right.
The music,  these are not hits.  Don't get excited.  Party Rock is pretty much the only song from this generation of music.
It's like a free for all.  People are all pretty much doing whatever they want with their limbs.  Fist pumps,  arm raises etc... I didn't know what Leslie actually wanted done with the arms on several occasions.

It's a quick rainy day walk,  and I'll keep it for that.",1426723200,4,785,4.26530612244898

5932950,1,B00EPH8S8U,"I really like Leslie's DVDs.  I own several of them but I was really disappointed with this one because of a couple of her song choices, the main song being the Party Rock Anthem.  Jesus Christ is my LORD and Saviour and this song is not something that I want to be listening to.  I ended up throwing it in the trash. I know I could have just skipped over the couple of sections that had that song, but it's way too easy to compromise as a Christian in this world.  And that does not bring one closer to the LORD.  Jesus said, Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me."" Matthew 16:24. Anyone thinking about buying this workout can look up the lyrics to that song and decide for themselves.

John 3:16 -  "" For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.""",1423526400,3,887,4.182352941176471

5932967,3,B00EPH8S8U,"I tried this dvd for the first time today. I was a personal trainer/aerobics instructor in my 'life before kids'. Now I am a sort-of fit, slightly overweight stay at home mom. I found this to be a very accessible workout. Many 'beginner' dvd's are nowhere near appropriate for people just starting out on their fitness journey. I would recommend this for anyone who thinks they are currently unfit. There are no complicated moves and her cueing is pretty good for the most part. I will probably get a copy  for my own mom who is in her mid '60's. There are no modifications offered, but marching rather than jumping or twisting is kind of a no brainer. (It is a mostly low-impact workout anyway)  I found it really easy to substitute in my own moves when I felt like it. I found it easy, but was a good choice for a day when I was really feeling too tired to exercise. The reason I give this dvd 3 stars is because of the music. I liked the music selection. e.g. - Lionel Richie: Dancing on the Ceiling, LMFAO: Party Rock, MC Hammer: Hammer Time etc. However!  They played the same songs multiple times, the beats per minute changed drastically from one song to the next and one song was particularly  tricky to even hear the beat in the opening bars.  I am not referring to the HIIT intervals where the beat sped up, but rather the transition from one song to the next.  I really can't understand how they couldn't find more than 4 or 5 songs for the whole workout. There are ZILLIONS of really catchy party songs that would be suitable for this kind of exercise dvd and any dj could put together a soundtrack far superior to this. It's not a workout I would want to to every day - there is only so much LMFAO I can take.  Also, she chatters through the whole thing. If you are looking for a solid, beginner work out though, I think this is a good choice.",1418688000,3,1856,4.316091954022989

5932986,4,B00EPH8S8U,"When I first used this dvd, it was shortly after having my second baby, so I had not lost much of the baby weight and was newly nursing.  So, needless to say, all that bouncing and jumping was NOT enjoyable for me.  Now that I am at a lower weight and not dealing with other mommy issues, this is actually my favorite Leslie workout currently.  Even though it's only 3 miles, I really feel like I have had a good workout when I'm done.  One of my favorite moves is when you jog forward 2, twist your hips for 2, then turn and jog 2 again (and continue this for a few rounds).  It really gets the heart rate up.  I kinda wish the HIIT segments were a bit longer, like 60 seconds instead of just 30, because just when I'm getting in the groove, they end.  But I also like that she boosts the heart rate at other times throughout the workout, too, not just during the HIIT (high intensity interval training) parts.

The music is fun.  It includes songs by Lionel Richie, MC Hammer, and the Black Eyed Peas, as well as several others. Some are instrumental, and others, like the ones I mentioned, have words, but it is a good variety of both.

I am not sure I'd recommend this to a beginner, as it's 3 miles continuous, and wouldn't really split well into separate miles (although you could if you want) and it is pretty intense, but if you're looking to get your heart rate up and get moderately sweaty, this is a good one!

Side note:  I like the variety of walkers she has in this one.  Yes, a lot of them are young and fit, but she mixes up age and body styles a bit more than some of the other newer dvd's she has.",1414022400,,1615,4.154340836012862

But, anyways, the actual video is great! Alittle different than the older ones, which are the ones we have. I love the music on it, tho, i would love to have MORE music on it and make the exercise more go to the beat of it. Cause sometimes it was kind of odd (for the lack of a better word), that the steps didn't go with the music.
Saying all of that, we still loved the video. I love Leslie's steps, makes it easier for people just beginning, and who know what they are doing. (daughter with autism loves these videos. They are simple for her to follow and keep her exercising!)

And as woman with some larger attributes, I could not do any of the bouncing or jumping.  Not to mention it is very hard on the knees.  Also, Leslie needs to realize that some of us have very limited space in which to exercise.  I can't simply move the furniture, as she suggests.

The title is misleading, and I have to think it is a bit on purpose.  The songs are party songs, for sure.  But were hits 20 years ago.  Yes, yes, I now know ""HITS"" is an exercise reference, but didn't at the time I bought the DVD.

I love the walk videos for days when it's either too hot or too wet to go outside.  Leslie is great at making the steps simple to follow and she is very good at the transition from one exercise to the next.  This video has the added bonus of HIT segments that really boost your heart rate to help you torch calories and build up your endurance. The music is upbeat and before you know you have walked 3 miles and your 45 minute workout is over.

I also like to add in some very light (3 lb.) hand weights to parts of the routine just to help pump up the calorie burn and tone my arms.",1410825600,,681,4.022222222222222

This one is more fun because the music and the other walkers. I thought the set looked nice enough. I noticed some people complaining about that.

What I didn't like is she did slow down too much in between ""intervals,"" just like some other reviewers mentioned. I just kept my moves big and ignored her suggestion to keep the movements easy. And she did not have this one very organized. She seemed surprised by song changes. I didn't mind that, that much, but it would have been nice if she were more organized. I hope she does more walks to fun songs because I definitely prefer that over her old stuff with the boring random techno/dance music from 20 years ago over and over. I always ended up muting her older dvds and listening to something else - like sermons or I suppose you could listen to audio books at the same time. I like that she offers the option of music only on here as well. I only want to hear what she has to say the first time, after that I would rather not.

Leslie ends up looking like a crazy person trying to keep up with the dancers and talk at the same time.  Her forced laugh and attempts at light-hearted conversation are vexing. Leslie is the one thing that could easily be removed from the video. In one section Leslie puts the participants through a fast-slow series that is confusing and poorly done.  If you only watch Leslie's ""performance"" this video will seem like the first day of practice of a very amateurishly staged workout video rather than the finished product; but if you watch the dancers and enjoy the music you'll actually get a decent workout.

I've done Hiit workouts before that I never wanted to touch again and this definitely isn't that. If you are experienced with Hiit training this is likely going to be much easier than you are used to, that being said you really control your own intensity and I definitely worked up a good sweat.

5933059,5,B00EPH8S8U,I''ve done a few of Leslie's programs and this was by far my favorite!  I enjoyed the HIIT system because it gives me a chance to catch my breath.  I was actually able to do the 3 mile walk the first time around.  I'm sure I will be able to stick to this program.  I did expect more songs but enjoyed the ones that were played and the setup.,1404777600,,341,3.898550724637681
5933060,1,B00EPH8S8U,I should have heeded the reviews of the consumers who purchased this DVD; I just can't get into her music choices and that just makes me disinterested;  I like the routines but the music has got to go.,1404777600,2,201,4.2894736842105265

5933066,5,B00EPH8S8U,This video is fun and a good way to add variety to the daily workout. I hope she makes more like this!,1403136000,,102,3.6818181818181817
5933067,4,B00EPH8S8U,I have tried several of her videos and I think this was my least favorite.  I like a more constant fast moving video for exercise!,1403136000,,130,4.2
5933068,5,B00EPH8S8U,"I noticed this was a lot younger of a crowd and way more coordinated/dance moves than the other walks with leslie. After walking to this for months it dawned on me that they almost all appear to be professional dancers. And they ARE. I am really disappointed because I feel Leslie sold out to the young / hip / dance age group by having the professionals in this video. You simply cannot do the same moves as them, keep the pace as them and maybe that is why she brought them in, because the average work out middle aged woman can't. Lesson here: If they kick to high, swing their hips too much and smile constantly they are professional performers. Bleh! I probably will look at all of her workouts as frauds from now on.",1403049600,2,722,4.355555555555555
5933069,5,B00EPH8S8U,"I have used Leslie Sansones DVD's and loved them. But The new ""Walk with the HITS Party Songs is the best one by far.

5933083,2,B00EPH8S8U,"My bride and I do Leslie's DVDs about every other day or even more often.  Have a number of Leslie's DVDs. This is our least favorite. Why?  The ""Hit"" thing (where you sprint for a limited burst)...is WAY too short!  The ""hit"" only lasts about 30 seconds and is just an annoyance...that little short burst does nothing in the way of creating exertion.  We'd prefer about 2-3 minutes of ""hit"" and then back to the medium pace. Do that every few minutes and we'd get a real work out.",1400803200,2,481,4.370786516853933
5933084,5,B00EPH8S8U,I love the walk to the hits DVD's I wish Leslie made more of them. I really work out a lot stronger with these. 3 months walking with her and I will never do another work out that is as fun.,1400630400,,190,3.658536585365854

5933086,2,B00EPH8S8U,"I have several Leslie Sansone exercise videos, but I'm giving this one away.  Understandable, she is trying to appeal to a broad (younger) base.  This was too fast and really off rhythmically.  The moves were not hard to follow but when it comes to a dance  beat, Leslie seem to be a bit challenged.",1400198400,6,299,4.481481481481482

5933091,4,B00EPH8S8U,"I don't have an iota's worth of rhythm in me, but I love to dance and I really enjoy Leslie's walking video's.  Purchasing this was a no brainer.  I'm not at the level, yet, of doing a 3 mile 'walk' with any ease.  Because of this, it's a challenging workout for me.  Do I wish I had the rhythm (or co-ordination) to do what the walkers are doing?  Sure.  It's not stopping me.  I do what I can and if I get out of synch with Leslie and crew, it's no biggie.  I'll get the moves down with a few more workouts - or I'll modify to meet my level of co-ordination.  My suggestion is that if you are new to Leslie, start with one of her true walking workouts, then you can graduate to this video.  I'd give this a 5 star rating except that because of the way this was packaged - there isn't any explanation as to what the separate chapters purpose is.  There's the whole workout, then chapters for miles 1, 2, 3 - which seem to start at full throttle.  I'll figure it out eventually.  Also - the music only versions have you listening to the music and watching Leslie talk (no sound from her) - a bit distracting.  Oh well.  All in All... I recommend this workout.",1399507200,,1159,4.134529147982063

5933094,5,B00EPH8S8U,"This video makes walking and getting fit a lot easier as Leslie guides the viewer along in an enthusiastic work out with interval training included. There are 4 modes from which to choose: the full routine which is a full 3 miles, then broken down to one mile, two miles and mile three. The music is fun and the whole thing is over before the agony of working out sets in. Sometimes Leslie is a little too sweet and laughy but that is easy to overlook since the rest is so good.
Shipping was super fast, thank you.",1399248000,,514,4.255102040816326

Great way to get your heart pumping. Love this video. Highly recommend it!!",1396828800,,337,4.827586206896552
5933101,5,B00EPH8S8U,I love the music selection on the exercise cvd.  Leslie keep you moving throughout the walk.  This Walk is different from her other cods because she does high impact by increasing the beat and movement.,1396742400,4,202,4.742857142857143

5933103,2,B00EPH8S8U,I've been doing workouts with Leslie for years. I love her. She keeps it simple.  I wanted something a little upbeat and different so I bought this.  I was very disappointed. For me the steps are hard to follow.  She usually goes into things slowly so you can catch on. I will continue to workout with her but with my old standbys.  She does have enough variety that I don't get bored.,1396483200,3,385,4.305555555555555

5933105,5,B00EPH8S8U,Motivating and fun! I have been walking with Leslie for years and this by far is the best! I like that the first mile has a warm up and slows downright at the end in a sort of cool down so that it's a good one to use when I try to fit a walk into my busy day. It's challenging and goes by fast!,1396396800,,294,3.5384615384615383
5933106,5,B00EPH8S8U,"I Love This DVD!  I am a big Leslie Sansone fan and I grabbed this DVD thinking it would just be a change of pace for me.  Boy, it IS very different!  First of all, the music is much better in this than in her earlier DVDs.  Dancing on the Ceiling, We Got the Beat, Party Rock Anthem.  It almost feels like dancing instead of working out!  The people doing it with her are REALLY getting into it!  They all seem like they are having a blast and it makes YOU feel like you are too! The HIIT training is really great!  She slows you down, then you do 30 seconds of really fast moves, then slow again,then fast, etc.  I think it is making a huge impact on my efforts to lose weight.  It is a little longer than some of her other DVDs (about 45 minutes) so you need to make sure you have enough time if you want to complete the entire thing.  You can do just 1, 2 or all 3 miles if you like from the menu.  I have been doing the entire thing on Saturdays.  She even says at one point, ""This is a great Saturday workout"".  I'm having a lot of fun with this one!  Keep 'em coming, Leslie!",1396310400,2,1082,3.9444444444444446

I needed a quick workout one day to build up my steps and beat him for the day, but we had somewhere to go after work and I didn't want to get really sweaty.  This ended up being a fun way to get in steps and amazingly get in 3 miles (Fitbit validated their distance).  It's sort of cheesy and I don't know if I would recommend it for an amazing workout for someone who's really fit.

I am very glad that I gave this DVD a chance because I found it to be fun and refreshing. The pace of this workout is faster and the moves felt so much more fun.  I really enjoyed the music, even the instrumental non-popular music had a great beat.  I found myself dancing along with Leslie's upbeat, energetic cast.  I had to take away a star becase, like the other walk to the hits DVD, there are pauses between songs that are silent.  Leslie seems to lose the beat during these pauses and that gets me on the wrong foot.  It's not distracting enough to ruin the entire workout experience, but I thought it was something worth mentioning.  I also liked the colors of the set and costumes, which had a lot of orange,red, yellow and coral.  It was nice to look at first thing in the morning.  Overall, I highly recommend this DVD if you are a fan of Lelie's newer, faster paced workouts.

She has some new moves and doesn't repeat the standard moves over & over as in other videos.  The HIIT section isn't hard like Turbofire or Chalean Extreme, but if you work as hard at your own pace, you should work up a sweat.  My only criticism is that they repeat songs.  There are a billion songs out there and for some reason, the video producers felt that they needed to repeat songs.

5933165,2,B00EPH8S8U,All of her videos are walking to fitness. I just thought walking to the hits would have some cool music to rock out to. It didn't. Might as well just use one of my other two videos. Pretty disappointing.,1390608000,,203,4.230769230769231
5933166,5,B00EPH8S8U,"I give this DVD 4.5 stars, but since that wasn't an option, I went with 5. Let's start w/ why I took down the 1/2 star.  I think the HIIT sessions are too short...I think they should be at least 1 minute long instead of just 30 seconds.

Anyway, on to the good stuff!!  I was a bit hesitant to order this DVD for fear of it being too similar to the Walk to the HITs Radio Remixes DVD; but I'm soooooo glad I decided to order this one because I actually like this DVD more than the radio remixes one!!  This is the same concept & format as the Radio Remixes, but this walk was different in many ways...more upbeat, and some different moves (such as the step knees). I actually sweated a lot more in this workout.  Even though the HIIT sessions were too short for me, I still got a great workout, and more importantly it was fun & energetic!

3-mile walks are my favorite because they're the perfect amount of time (45 min).  This is definitely a great one & I'm super glad I bought it.  I actually enjoyed the music very much & didn't think they were lame at all (& I'm one of Leslie's younger fans born in the 80's). I use Leslie's DVDs 6 to 7 x a week to maintain my weight loss; leslie is truly my favorite DVD fitness guru.  Even though I'm young & healthy & able to do higher intensity workouts, I prefer to stick with Leslie's walk DVDs because they are gentle, fun & so effective!  Sorry, I'm rambling on now.....GET THIS DVD!  And if you're debating between this one or the radio remixes, get this one instead!",1390608000,3,1517,4.196551724137931
5933167,4,B00EPH8S8U,Love this video - it's a little different than the others I have of hers and she has some toning exercises after the end of the 30 min workout.,1390521600,,143,3.9655172413793105
5933168,4,B00EPH8S8U,I typically dislike Leslie Sansone walking videos because she talks entirely too much but this one is pretty good. It has a good pace to it and the HIITS do get get your heart rate up. I believe maybe she should have you do a little more at times with the HIITS but it's still a little higher intensity than previous videos. My biggest complaint about this. DVD would be that she reuses songs that she just barely played. I'm sorry but she must like more than 3-4 songs. Why not get something else in there? I can see myself getting sick of the songs and frustrated especially having heard them twice in one day. But overall it's a great DVD that does get your heart rate up.,1390521600,,675,4.28125
5933169,5,B00EPH8S8U,"I have 7 Leslie Sansone Videos, and Leslie Sansone: Walk to the HITS Party Songs is my new #1. My other favorites are Leslie Sansone: Walk to the HITS Radio Remixes and Leslie Sansone: Ultimate 5 Day Walk Plan for different reasons, and for Leslie beginners I'd recommend the 1st Leslie video I was introduced to: Leslie Sansone: Walk at Home - 5 Day Slim Down - A Mile Each Morning .

The Walk to the HITS Party Songs video is a 3-mile ""walk"" which runs just over 45 minutes from warm-up to cool down, both of which are included in the miles. The HIITs (high intensity interval training) each last around 30 seconds and are bracketed by slower sections since the theory is that varying the intensity creates better fitness. There is 1 HIIT in the first mile, 3 in the second, and 1 in the final.

The songs that you might recognize include Dancing on the Ceiling, U Can't Touch This, Part Rock Anthem, and We Got the Beat. I have to confess that they were not really familiar to me before, but I love all of them now. The other non-radio songs seem to be more musical and more fun than ever before in a Leslie video. And the match of songs to choreography is so great it feels like fun, like dancing, not exercising, not walking. And that's another point: it's a fallacy to call this a walk video. Yes, Leslie's standard moves (walk, knee lifts, kicks, sidesteps) are all here, but there is jogging, bouncing, shifts, step-tap, tap-out, skiers, step-knee, twists, and so on. As I said, it's choreographed and feels a lot like my favorite aerobics class from the 80's, although you can do it all low-impact if you choose.

I love the walkers too. Yes, they are younger and more fit than those in some of the old videos, but that's part of the reason the video is great. They love what they are doing, and they inspire me to love it also. I see them having fun with the moves, following Leslie, but also adding their own style till it seems as if they cannot be still. When the cool down comes, they don't want it to end and neither do I. In fact, that's the only negative thought I have to share. I agree with another reviewer in wanting 3 solid miles; the cool down should be additional.

As to results, here's my story. I started getting serious about losing weight last May and began daily 30-minute workouts at Curves. For a while that was it. I was in my 60's, obese, weak, and out of shape. Someone at Curves introduced me to Walk at Home - 5 Day Slim Down - A Mile Each Morning. I added that slowly since I was learning the moves and able to last for only 15 minutes-barely. I bought other Leslie videos and liked them OK, but they weren't inspiring enough that I looked forward to doing them alone at home. By the time I bought Ultimate 5 Day Walk Plan I was able to do 2 miles at one time, and I value this one because here are 5 different fun walks and they go by FAST.  I do 4 miles (42 minutes) on this one on days when I can't get to Curves. Then came the HITS videos. At last there is a home program that doesn't bore me. I alternate the 1st one (Radio Remixes) and this one (Party songs) in the evening before dinner and I actually look forward to them. Eight months later, thanks to Curves, Leslie, and learning portion sizes with My Fitness Pal Calorie Counter, I am down nearly 60 pounds.

The DVD's are really inexpensive right now. Try them and get fit!",1390262400,105,3373,4.29559748427673

5933190,3,B00EPH8S8U,"Ok, so after the other ""Dance Hits"" or whatever the previous video was called, I was a bit apprehensive.  The so-called ""HIIT"" seesions (high intensity interval training) on the other video didn't strike me as particularly intense, and I was also very annoyed by Leslie doing (I think) 4 sets of 20 or 30 second intervals, slowing down for a while, and then doing another set lasting 2 minutes or so after she said we were all done with the intervals.  What makes this HIIT any different from any of her other videos that feature ""boosts"" or intervals of higher activity?  I would have understood if, let's say, the video had those 30 second intervals for the entire duration of the workout- that would seem to make sense.  I am not a physiologist,though, so maybe there's a reason for the weird spacing of the intervals.  I can say that the set is so ugly that it hurts my feelings.  And I am still mystified by the ""KidzBop"" covers of songs that they use- I suppose there are issues with rights and things, plus they need to make sure the beats are just the speed they need for the exercizes, but my goodness, a bad cover of Lionel Ritchie's ""Dancing on the Ceiling"" is just a mess.  The GoGo's ""We Got The Beat"" just reminds me of how young I was when the song was released, and how old I am now.  The cast of walkers is fine, although I am still curious as to why we don't see the old guard- Mary Kay, Linda, Joanne, and Carol- anymore.  Let's face it, this is a workout for the middle-aged, and I enjoyed seeing people my age or older staying fit and active.  Overall, this is probably one of my least favorite Leslie videos, which is a shame because the two ""HIIT"" DVDs came right on the tail of three of my favorite Leslie Videos (Belly Blast, Walk it off in 30 Days, 5 Mega Miles).  And if you are debating between Radio Remixes and this one, get the Radio Remixes.",1388448000,92,1873,4.33810888252149
5933191,5,B00EPH8S8U,"I absolutely love this workout DVD.  Leslie is great and adding different songs really, REALLY helps.  I love the way Leslie implemented different songs but chose songs that have not vulgar lyrics.  GREAT job Leslie.  We LOVE you.",1388361600,,230,4.973684210526316
5933192,2,B00EPH8S8U,"I loved Radio Remixes with HIIT training so I was really looking forward to this one. What a disappointment. I didn't care for the music at all ( Lionel Ritchie, The Go Go's, MC Hammer....Really???). The HIIT intervals seem to have been shortened when they really need to be longer. I didn't break a sweat or feel an increased heart rate until we went past the 2 mile mark and since the workout is only 3 miles, that isn't good.

This workout may be good for beginners but it's a bit too slow for a long time walker and exerciser. If you want to try the HIIT training then Radio Remixes is a far better workout.

I like Leslie Sansone and she's done some very good workout dvd's but , in my opinion, this isn't one of them. Save your money...",1388275200,9,742,4.25531914893617

5933195,5,B00EPH8S8U,Leslie has done it again with another great workout video.  I love the songs and the moves on the video.,1387756800,,104,4.2
5933196,2,B00EPH8S8U,"I usually love Leslie's videos.  I actually enjoy the Radio Hits workout and I walk to it almost every day.  In this video, however, the music (and thus the pace) is slower than Radio hits.  Even the HIIT training is slower.  I'm not really impressed with this video.",1387497600,3,267,4.5
5933197,1,B00EPH8S8U,"This is my 12th Leslie DVD and I THOUGHT this DVD would be New & Exciting.  It was neither.  The ""party"" music was not exciting at all and changed often.  I believe the DVD is a failed attempt for Leslie to get ""funky"" and help me here this can not be a new DVD it has to be 15 years old.  She has Overly Enthusiastic Walkers behind her smiling too much and well this ""Party Song"" DVD doesn't come off at all.  BTW you can do ""music only"" on this DVD which is ALWAYS something I like on her Tapes (Leslie do it on all of them), because I for one get SOOOO tired of her ceaseless  chit-chat.  There are two DVDs of Leslie that I can't recommend, don't like, and really should return;  this one (Party Songs)  and ""Radio Hit"" both are losers.",1387065600,14,740,4.083333333333333

I really enjoyed Walk to the HITS Radio Remixes and expected something different this time. It was a bit disappointing...",1386806400,3,278,4.365384615384615
5933201,4,B00EPH8S8U,"This reminds me a great deal of the Radio Hits workout that Leslie has.  I still think the high intensity parts of the workout are too short and the transitions aren't very smooth (which surprises me since she's been insistent that this needs to happen on some of her other workouts), but I will keep doing it and hope it grows on me more.  At least it's a nice switch to my other workout DVDs.  I do wish she'd have a few people who aren't young and in great shape - even if they would be relegated to the back row.  I do like Leslie.  Very motivating instructor.",1386547200,4,564,4.185185185185185

8608062,5,B00EPH8S8U,"I discovered Leslie Sansone this year and I love it. She's nice. She's positive. Yes, she's chatty but it makes me laugh. I was off the exercise wagon (and really never that great at being on it) for a while. Other people's work out ""boot camps"" make me feel like I'm in 1980s gym class. Burpies? For real? Ugh. Once was enough, thank you. Plus I often pushed too hard and ended up injured. I figured slow and steady wins my race. These videos save my day! I love this one for days when I need a quicker work out. I try to aim for 5 or 6 ""Leslie"" miles. Somedays it is a lot to ask for. This one is great for the morning and then finish with a few more in the evening. I know it's more time consuming than the ""killer"" cardio/weight/burpie blasts but I can do these EVERYDAY. Plus, I'm 44 and boot camp isn't going to cut it 10 years. (Even people in the military retire in their 40s because boot camp type demands. It's not for the long haul, people!) I need something for the long run that's fun. This is it!",1531267200,,1010,4.106060606060606

8608068,4,B00EPH8S8U,"This one enjoyed more than radio remixes even though there is still some jumping. Perhaps I enjoy the music and style more on this one so I just walk right over those parts and do what I can. It is still very much Zumba-inspired but at 33 I enjoy this a bit more than Zumba. I have done zumba, dancing with the stars Latin dance, and the step-up dance dvds but if you feel you aren't getting the choreography correct you aren't really working out. With Zumba every movement is specifically designed to work something so missing it means you're missing out. My goal now is for working out is to improve my health and circulation from a sitting job. Sometimes I'm not in the mood to dance in my living room to music that doesn't inspire. I feel the music and HIIT training are really good on this dvd. I walk as fast as I can without jumping (second floor apartment) during those segments. Overall, if you're looking for an alternative to the dance routines or other difficult work-outs-this one I recommend!",1525046400,,1006,4.502732240437158
8608069,5,B00EPH8S8U,I love Leslie....I have several of her videos and this one is refreshing and fun. It's three different 1 mile walks and the music is great motivation.,1524009600,,150,4.592592592592593
8608070,5,B00EPH8S8U,I have been doing these work outside for years!  Luv them!  No crazy dance moves.  Good for all levels of health.  Have fun!!!,1523404800,,126,4.3478260869565215
