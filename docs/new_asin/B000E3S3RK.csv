8105368,5,B000E3S3RK,"Filmed in 1962 or thereabouts. The blimp was the social media of it's time. The concepts discovered in the story are the same simple ones of today. The best way to witness and reach out is to be someone's friend and put your self ""out"" of the box just a little. Social Media is ok but does not work like talking with a human being.",1377129600,,331,4.107692307692307
8105369,4,B000E3S3RK,Past the cheesy story line this satirical movie from the sixties is an informational perspective of how some believers are prone to behaving within their Christian ghettos. It's definitely worth the viewing.,1368662400,,207,5.5

Even though the content is dated, it has a timeless message which is important for any church or church leader to see.  The extremes to which the characters go are very humorous - especially the fact they don't seem to get the main message of the film themselves at the end.  But even though this DVD is entertaining and funny, there are some very heavy lessons we can learn from watching it.  Its message is definitely timeless and applies today just as much as it did when it was originally made.  We need to learn these lessons!  Too many people are making these same mistakes on a much smaller scale and don't even realize it.  I recommend it if you want a subtle way to address the issue of being more intentional in sharing the gospel with others.",1329696000,,851,4.451612903225806
