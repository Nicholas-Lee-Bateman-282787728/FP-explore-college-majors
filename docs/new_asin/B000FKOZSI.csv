8124292,5,B000FKOZSI,"110 Minute DVD (includes music and tab) - Professional musician Paul ""Pazzo"" Mehling is a founder of the Hot Club of San Francisco, a group known for its fine gypsyjazz music in the style of Django Reinhardt. Years ago, when Mehling visited the Django Festival in France, he noticed some others whispering about his playing during jam sessions. He discovered that it was because his solos were not being heard so he obtained some advice from other gypsy-swing players there and then proceeded to retrain himself to incorporate a ""radically different"" guitar-playing technique using bent wrist at a 45 degree angle.  Using this approach will result in improved control, power, tone and speed.

Mehling points out that these exercises are for both hand and head because mental thought is also tantamount to good playing. Mehling is a very personable, articulate and knowledgeable instructor. The nearly two hours of instruction are graduated in difficulty and include such things as strums, vibrato, tremolo, single string techniques, chromatic exercises, string crossing, and sweep picking. Advanced techniques address legato, double down, and subdividing. All are excellent ""keys"" to good playing for more advanced guitarists. A committed guitarist practicing diligently two or three times daily with Paul (for at least 20-30 minutes at a time) will greatly improve their pick power. Not only will one's instrument sound louder and with better tonality, but you'll notice an ability to play faster (when needed) and with greater expression, authority and dynamics. Paul also shares interesting information about his guitars, strings and picks.

Mehling's group has released nine CDs, and I would further recommend that, in conjunction with this DVD, you also study his most recent recorded music to fully appreciate the potential of learning his powerful techniques.
