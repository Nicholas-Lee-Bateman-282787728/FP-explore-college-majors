5792763,2,B00DDF0UV8,Lack of instructions and explanations. Weak cardio ( unless you like jumping and jumping and jumping....) this needs new editing and lower price (def. lower price) not worth the money or time,1385942400,12,191,5.0
5792764,2,B00DDF0UV8,"I am really disappointed in this video and the diet.  I am very interested in working out in new ways and have liked some videos that others find intense such as P90X.  The cardio portion of the video is annoying with no cueing but more importantly it is pretty feeble.  If you really enjoy working out it is too easy.  Tracy Anderson seems to imply that being feminine means being weak, low energy and a bit prissy.  However, if you follow her diet which is low in both calories and protein this is all you may have energy to do.  I found that my fitness level and appearance actually was much worse than usual on this plan. I had hoped that criticisms of this plan were simply people who were not motivated and intense enough about exercise.  I find I am the fitest and smallest when I am lifting relatively heavy weights, with a high protein diet and relatively long cardio. If you like to dance find then find a real dancer's workout please don't waste your money on this woman's technically lacking workout combined with a diet to destroy your metabolism.  I actually look and feel better when I am happy, vigorous and well nourished. This program does none of that. I do find that the emphasis on using different angles and different motions was helpful and a good idea.",1372982400,22,1276,4.4935064935064934
5792765,3,B00DDF0UV8,"Well, first the cardio DVD is horrible!!! Basically you bounce up and down for 30 minutes. Fast changing positions of so called dance moves without cues.....ugh. I love cardio but not this kind. Before I got the DVD I did go on line and read reviews but at the time there was not a lot of them. Now there are many reviews for different Tracy Anderson DVDs. I wanted to add my opinion and warn others before they drop 70-90$. The rest of the four DVDs also have no cues to her fast moving routines, so it takes a long time to get use to that. Also the music is boring but you can set it so you don't have to listen to the music and of course you can turn down the volume and listen to your own music since she doesn't give a lot of cues or instructions. That leads me to my next complaint, little instruction. Which makes no sense since she is very adamant about doing her moves exactly like she does and form is very important to her method. Form without instruction is useless. I have no idea what she was thinking. Her claim to fame is her fast moving arm movements and her leg work and they are great and do work!!!! All her DVDs have these same workouts.... I am still unsure if there is a big difference between her abecentic DVD and her other metamorphosis DVDs. She claims these workouts will not bulk you up and actually thin your body and muscles. Many professionals complain about her claims of working out your small muscles over larger muscles groups. Being naturally petite and thin I can't attest to not being bulked up because I can't bulk up easily. I feel that if you have a tendency to bulk up this work out will prevent that. I don't think you need to spent the money to get the best part of her tapes because you can now go on YouTube and see a lot of her arm and leg workouts and learn them and use them in your regular workouts. Hope this helped",1371945600,47,1867,4.203342618384401
5792766,5,B00DDF0UV8,"Great program, with really quick results. Love the mat workouts and the arm sections. Dance part is not my favorite, but she has many others on you tube that are great. My favorite is dance cardio for beginners #3. I didn't do the diet. To much prep. Not enough food. I have lost 20 pounds in 2 months, have great muscle tone and have lost inches everywhere.

One last year what you call ""Omnicentric"" and another one last March for ""Abcentric""...After working out my whole body I wanted something SECIFIC for my ABS....it suppose to be totally different workout, but the videos, DVD's are EXACTELY the same. IT'S NOT FAIR! and it is not specified that the DVD's contain the same same same exercises. I'M SOOOOOO DISAPOINTED",1431993600,6,417,5.043478260869565

5792769,1,B00DDF0UV8,"I really have this my best shot but today I will list it on EBay. I agree with other reviewers that her lack of instruction makes it so hard to follow along and I am familiar with her Method. Not only that,but my Abs look awful since using this program-I remember someone saying they had ""donut abs"" since doing her program and that's what mine look like- squishy on the sides and flatter in the middle-not encouraging. Plus my knees hurt from being on all fours-I even bought a thicker mat and it didn't help. I'm an advanced excerciser and highly recommend the Tonique dvd's by Sylwia Weisenberg. She has moves similar to Tracy's but with much better cueing. I do like many of Tracy's workouts,just not MetamorphisiS.I love Mat,Perfect Design,Precision Toning and her new Method Express. I feel that Metamorphisis was a lot of hype and overpriced for the lack of instruction and dread factor. I know some people got great results from this but I did not. I personally get much better results using my Classic strength workouts-I know Tracy does not believe in heavier weights but I find that less concentrated Abs work and lifting weights 3-4times a week is what hollows out my Abs. I am 48 with 3 kids and I also tried Hipcentric,which by the way seems almost identical to Abcentric",1429574400,,1285,4.665198237885463
5792770,5,B00DDF0UV8,"DVDs arrived way before the expected delivery date. Very happy about that! I also got the links to meal plans, calendar and even a weekly grocery shopping list. Loved that! I lost 8 pounds in the first 10 days. I love the muscular workouts and I've gotten to really enjoy the cardio now. I'm doing the omnicentric but bought the abcentric to try later.  I followed the meal plan and it has taught me to really watch what I eat. Tracy Anderson is the best method to get into great shape!",1428710400,3,486,4.34065934065934

5792773,1,B00DDF0UV8,"Horrible customer service at the Tracy Anderson website.  She gets lazier and lazier making the workouts as she makes more.  She does something on one side and forgets to do it on the other, she offers lots of instructions on the beginning and then never talks again, the camera focuses on weird angles like her foot so you can't see what she is doing, she moves around into this sort of blurred white zone where you can't see what she is doing, sometimes the workout is incomplete (i.e. arms and abs but no legs), you can tell when they just dubbed together some random workouts to make it look like one continuous one, they also sometimes just flip the image around on the screen so it looks like the other side (right versus left), and she jumps from one sequence to the next leaving you no time to move with her.  Overall, they figured out a way to sell ""variety"" without actually making any variety.",1424044800,2,904,4.466666666666667
5792774,3,B00DDF0UV8,"Goofy cardio section that I don't bother with... The floor exercises are very good in that they focus on the smaller muscles and work with controlled repetition.  I don't use this as described, but I incorporate the floor exercises in with my other regular work outs and go for traditional cardio.",1412985600,,297,4.823529411764706
5792775,4,B00DDF0UV8,"When I ordered TA abcentric,  I have to say it is not what I expected! I expected DVDs to work out to. I also got this extremely strict diet plan to follow.  I love exercise , and real food,  so I figured, why not? I went full wild on and wrapped my brain around what Tracy Anderson is trying to do to change my body.  I am willing to try anything. I have extreme food allergies, auto immune disorder and problems with candida and yeast.  Strict diets improve my well being.
I usually feel really good.  I recorded all the food and recipes and put it in my iphone on my LoseIt app to track
calories , exercise and portions. Purchased all the food and prepared week 1, portioned in small containers.  After I had 2 physicians review the diet, they thought it's ok, reduced calorie will not kill you, but so little protein will make you lose muscle, so I adjusted that part for myself.  Started DVDs immediately.  Wow!  This was tough.  I am 48 yrs young and extremely active.  Weights, cardio, hot yoga, horses, trail riding, hunter paces, work, office, kids, step kids , grand kids etc etc.  I loved the ab portion, got through the leg lifts and thought, that's it?  I still had cardio dancing to do.  That was insane and took practice. After riding my horses, I was whipped and tried to figure out how I was going to do all of this in one day.
I had to have a plan to make it work, I really could not do everything in one day.  So I had to reduce other activities .
I  loved her techno club music.  It's kind of addictive and called me to my workouts.  You will have to add extra protein to the diet.  Fish and turkey are food choices, steak if you are a true carnivore like me.  If it swims or flies you can follow the diet , but if you are losing energy, a little red meat goes a long way.
Staying off of wheat and dairy are key.
I don't drink the wine by choice. When I decide to incorporate alcohol it will be clear like vodka or amber like bourbon.
Be patient and be committed . Everyone can use a little cardio dance. Take it slow if you cannot keep up. Ice your sore spots and take your Advil and Cosamin and maybe rest a day to heal up. Stretching is important , take time to warm up because she does not incorporate this in the workout.  The family outings we have coming up will be cheat days, and I also have a wedding, but the work outs should keep me on track.
This is something you really should try for yourself.  It's not the worst thing you have ever done and you will see results.",1412812800,5,2499,4.149688149688149
5792776,1,B00DDF0UV8,"The worst. I've never written a review before of any workout DVD and I have to say, I am so disappointed with this. The cardio routine is a ridiculous half hour of trying to figure out what Tracy will do next. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to it (although I'm sure to her there is). It would take you at least 50 viewings to get a handle on what to do next. She doesn't let you know what's coming up or even have some kind of visual on the bottom to keep up. Her reasoning is, it will take you a bit to get this, but eventually you will. So silly. Just jump around for a half hour with some jumping jacks and you'll get the same workout. Then I moved on to the Abcentric portion and again, BARELY any instruction and while looking down, trying to focus on your legs and abs, she moves on to the next exercise. Honestly, don't waste your money. P90X or Power 90 is a thousand times better as far as walking you through the routines and making sure you are constantly checking yourself.",1412467200,3,991,4.139896373056994
5792777,5,B00DDF0UV8,"I LOVE LOVE Tracy Anderson's metamorphosis series. It was very challenging at first- especially since I had never done dance cardio before and thought I would never be able to ""get it."" But after sticking with it- I saw AMAZING results within 2 weeks. I finished the 90 day metamorphosis (abcentric) and have now moved on to the continuation exercises Continuity. I am 30 and look phycically better than I ever did in high school/my 20s. She has literally transformed my body, but the way I feel about exercise, food, and healthy lifestyle choices in general. I've been using Tracy's exercises for over 2 years now. I cannot sing her praises enoug!. Her program TRULY works and keeps me challenged.",1410393600,5,698,4.825

5792779,5,B00DDF0UV8,"I love, love, love, TA's method.  I began with her beginners dvd and moved up to her Mat workout then, Precision (my favorite).  Now I have begun the Abcentric.  Her way is a lot harder than it appears.  Especially if you take the time to follow the detail correctly.
I am in my mid 50's and started with her beginners so that I would not get hurt.  She builds your strength steadily & evenly.  Even though I have disc problems, I have sailed through all the above listed dvd's without a hitch.  Friends and family keep asking what have I been doing?  My clothes have never fit so great!!  I have been a runner for years with several plus marathons under my belt.  She has actually convinced me that her way is healthier!",1397952000,12,721,4.353383458646617
5792780,3,B00DDF0UV8,"This version only has the DVDs and none of the diet plan and measuring tape additions to it. You can look up the recipes online and use your own tape but don't think you're getting a deal on the full set.

The diet is rough. Eating mush for a week will make you cranky but I sucked it up and looked forward to my week of solids. I don't really get the week of mush because I do chew my food and it ends up in the same state when I swallow it. However, solids week is your 600-700 calorie week so its more of a starvation crankiness. I didn't lose any weight despite the major calorie deficit I'm guessing because my body was in starvation mode. Unfortunately when I had to stop the workout and I went back to eating normally (vegan, no junk food, less than 1700/day) I ended up gaining weight since my body thought it needed to hoard calories. So that blows.

As far as the exercise portion, I haven't gotten past level 3 in this because I'm scared to death of restarting it and injuring myself again.
First, I did not do the cardio because its essentially jumping up and down the entire time which isn't my cup of tea due to lower back issues so I did my own that's not as rough on the spine.
The bulk of each session are leg lifts. HUNDREDS of leg lifts a day. I wasn't really sure how this was going to help my abs but I went with it and very quickly noticed a change in my butt but not my stomach just yet. By the third set of lessons the leg lifts incorporate more of a side bend as you are on hands and knees and when you lift your leg to the side you bring your knee to your shoulder. This is what led to my injury.
It only took reaching for something on a shelf for me to have an excruciating pain rip across the side of my ribcage and under my shoulder blade making it hard to breathe. It was one of the most painful experiences I have ever had in my life and had I not been able reach my boyfriend on his phone I was going to have to call 911 (no idea what i would've done if my phone hadn't been in my pocket). I spent 2 hours writhing and screaming in pain before he was able to pull me up off the floor to take me to the ER. The Dr determined it was a muscle spasm and my arm was in a sling for several days. It took nearly 2 months for me to even consider working out again and when I tried one of those knee to shoulder leg lifts I could feel exactly where the spasm shot across my side.
I do yoga and am generally pretty flexible so that injury really surprised me. I don't feel like that rigorous a workout, 6 days a week is just not good for somebody who isn't already in top athletic shape (and why would you need this if you were?). While I enjoyed the rearview results I will never again attempt to do this routine in its diet plan and exercise schedule entirety. I *MIGHT* attempt the training part again because it really did show results but I'll switch to every other day and not do the full movements to the side.

Be VERY careful with this routine, Tracy warns you not to modify or leave something out but I can tell you its not worth injuring yourself. If you want to do it (I do not deny it brings results) listen to your body, eat healthy food in smaller portions, and lighten up on the routines if you need to.",1397692800,5,3241,4.029503105590062
5792781,5,B00DDF0UV8,"I don't understand why people complain about lack of instruction! really how hard is it to follow a person moving. Her moves repeat (meaning at least 40 reps) If you don't get the first one eventually you will get it. The dance is a lot of jumping so substitute your own 30 minute cardio (treadmill or elliptical etc..)
History: I am an apple shape (three kids in two years).My last pregnancy I had large twins so that did some damage!  I am short so I look like I am still pregnant. I have tried many workouts and lately I found out as an apple shape I have an adrenal body type. Which basically means I release more cortisol (stress hormone)which results in fat accumulation on the stomach. They actually recommend low intensity exercise (walking, yoga and stretches) for losing weight. This kind of makes sense to me as I have done heavy workouts and have seen no change in my body. a few months ago I tried Tracy anderson Metamorphosis (abcentric). I  absolutely love it. It is not time consuming, I wake up and do the mat workout (30 minutes) have a tea and then get on my treadmill (30-40 minutes). I have literally seen my upper abs tighten to the point I can see the indent in the middle (love that). My butt has lifted and my thighs are rock hard. I used to get a lot of hip pain probably due to the two pregnancies. I am not a ""hippy girl""! The multiple leg lifts must of strengthened my hip/ abd muscles. The diet is too strict for me, I just eat better than before. People are asking me what are you doing but, of course I don't tell them!
Stop complaining and try it. substitute what you don't like. But seriously look at her.
Buy those padded mats and I would recommend even using knee pads if you are worried about being on your knee's a lot. I think Tracy anderson dvd's are a great weekly addition to your workout. I only do them 4 days a week and walk, do yoga and some minimal weights. This routine has done so much for my body. You will not lose large amounts of weight but, you will tighten and strengthen some important muscles you use on a daily basis.",1394323200,26,2075,4.304347826086956

5792784,5,B00DDF0UV8,"I love this program.  INcredible. There is nothing out there like it.  Tracy's method is based on much research, and lots of experience.  She is the go-to expert for Hollywood's biggest stars.  I've done metamorphosis and it is life-changing, not just another work for home.  Actually, when something is this good (which I've seen with other things) many people will be negative about it.  I would imagine they didn't really put the 90 days into it to see the results, otherwise they might feel a lot different.  Program is amazing.  I didn't find anything hard about the moves or cues...you need to do it more than 3 times.  After a week, I could anticipate everything and do almost everything with out watching her.  Practice, time, commitment, good attitude...just bringing that to the table will help you succeed.  I  usually don't write a lot of reviews but after I saw these negative ones, I felt that they were not fair, especially when I've had soo much success with it.",1391904000,18,978,4.755952380952381

I love dancing and I adore cardio but she just jumps around constantly changing steps and not one word of instruction.  Ugh - big waste of time and money!

Also, the diet is ridiculous.  Everyone knows that super-low calorie diets don't work!  You need to eat to fuel your body and rev up your metabolism.

Overall, Tracy looks real cute in the videos but offers zero instruction and has a very unrealistic view of what women need to lose weight and tone up.  Really a pitiful attempt.",1386374400,12,717,4.345864661654136
