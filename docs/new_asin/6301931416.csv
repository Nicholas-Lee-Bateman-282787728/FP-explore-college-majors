7816847,4,6301931416,"""BOXING'S BEST: Muhammad Ali"" was originally a free gift offered with a subscription to a popular sports magazine. It's a clean HiFi dub of a 1981 HBO documentary on the boxer that his trainer Angelo Dundee freely admits here to being the greatest heavyweight of all time.

Mostly brief, often low-contrast fight clips are interspersed with commentary or equally short excerpts of training, press conferences and news reports. Little of Muhammad Ali's life beyond the usual anecdotes is revealed. Missing is the thrashing Ali gave former champ Floyd Patterson, who insisted on calling him ""Clay."" Also no mention of the famous simulated 1969 battle with Rocky Marciano

7816848,2,6301931416,"This was produced for HBO television's series on great heavyweights, a series which includes Joe Louis and Jack Dempsey. Each program runs just under an hour. With such little time alotted for such a significant figure as Muhammad Ali, this production gives a very sketchy outline of his life and career. Significantly less than half of the 59 minutes contains actual fight footage, and the quality of the color footage of the Frazier fights is particularly poor - grainy and runny. The non-fight footage shows host Barry Tompkins interviewing the owner of the Louisville gym where Ali (then Clay) first trained, and interviews with his longtime trainer Angelo Dundee. There are, though, a number of period film footage interviews with Ali, of the pre-fight buildup variety. There is some brief footage of Ali speaking to college students during the time he was stripped of his title for his refusal to be drafted, but there is no attempt in this documentary to explain his religious convictions, and why he was a  conscientious objector. There is no insight into his conversion to Islam, to begin with. There is, though, some rare early fight footage, including about 17 seconds of his 1960 Olympic finals victory, and about a half-minute of his first professional bout. The other fight footage contains highlights of his bouts with: Archie Moore (1962), Sonny Liston (both I and II), Cleveland Williams, Zora Folley, Oscar Bonavena, Joe Frazier (I, II and III), Leon Spinks, and Larry Holmes. There is no footage of his 1970 comeback match with Jerry Quarry, and as another reviewer mentioned, no footage of the Foreman fight. My guess is that HBO might not have had the rights to that footage at the time this was produced. Until a better documentary on his life in and out of the ring is produced - one that is both an in-depth character study and that contains more fight footage, and higher quality footage, take my, and the other reviewers suggestion, and buy the videos of the complete first Liston, third Frazier, and Foreman fights. ""When We Were Kings"" is another excellent video to get.",977616000,7,2098,4.909859154929578
