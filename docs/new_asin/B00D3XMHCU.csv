8589277,4,B00D3XMHCU,"[Not to be confused with a 1977 Peter Yates film ""The Deep"" starring Jacqueline Bisset, Nick Nolte and Robert Shaw.]

""The Deep"" (""Djpi"") is an Icelandic movie following the real-life story of six fishermen falling overboard into the cold water from a capsized fishing boat, off the coast of the Westman Islands, Iceland, in 1984. The plotline itself is simple up to the fatal incident. What is unique about the film is the rest of the story, where the ""miracle"" of survival of Gulli (lafur Darri lafsson) is made even more poignant. Can you ""research"" a miracle?

Director Baltasar Kormkur, who has worked for two Mark Wahlberg movies in Hollywood so far (""Contraband"" and ""2 Guns""), could have made the story of survival more emotional and sentimental. Instead, he opted for telling Gulli's story in a quiet and realistic way.

His approach works, but not perfectly. ""The Deep"" runs only 90-odd minutes, and the film, authentic as it is, is still too short for us to know the plights of the protagonist (the actual survivor appears in the end credits). His incredible story deserves that.",1378598400,4,1090,4.881081081081081

*You may find this review contains ""spoilers""*

The story upon which this film is based is so literally incredible that scientists still can't quite work out how it happened.

In March 1984 a generously proportioned 22 year old was one of six men thrown from a sinking Icelandic trawler during an Arctic storm. His crewmates drowned within minutes, but Gulaugur ""Gulli"" Frirsson swam for six hours to a volcanic island. He then walked, wet and barefoot, over broken-glass basalt lava flows and through a frozen gale, for two and a half hours, to his rescue. He kept himself sane by talking to seagulls and undertaking to his God, in exchange for one more day, to pay off his debts, comfort his fallen comrades' families and show his mother he no longer sculls milk straight out of the fridge.

Gulli was found with no pulse. The thermometer didn't go low enough to register his body temperature. He's alive and well today. If this sounds like an Old Testament tribulation, that's exactly what Baltasar Kormkur makes it into in this quite extraordinary motion picture.

When it comes to portraying human endurance, cinema has always been codified smoke and mirrors. There was once a thin golden strand of ""vrit"" populated by directors of a Calvinist disposition, for whom true art came only from real suffering. Men like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Werner-Herzog/dp/B00018HU68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Werner Herzog</a>, who would have their crew lug&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/real-cannons-down-Machu-Picchu/dp/B00004I9Q4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">real cannons down Machu Picchu</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/push-paddle-steamers-over-a-hill/dp/B000P0JPZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">push paddle-steamers over a hill</a>. Kormkur is one of their number.

Nowadays digital horsepower can render any scene, however apocalyptic, in infinitely detailed holographic surround sound. Thus have these famous men been annihilated by the all-conquering Pentium processor.

All but one: Baltasar Kormkur still believes in doing it the old-fashioned way, and in lafur Darri lafsson he has his Klaus Kinski (or, at any rate, a heroic inversion: where Kinski's characters would sell their souls to the devil, lafsson's commends his to the Lord). In its extraordinary commitment to its craft, The Deep resoundingly falsifies the gospel of the computer generated image. It magisterially demonstrates the awesome power of real nature. We are but ants.

Kormkur and his cast look reverentially into the eye of God. Some of the cinematography in this film, above and below the surface; in wide angles and in tight, is simply staggering.

The first half of the film charts the fated voyage of the Breki, a trawler operating out of the Westman Islands, off the south west coast of Iceland. The islanders had their own moment looking God in the eye in 1973 when their home unexpectedly erupted creating Eldfell, a 1600 metre volcano which covered the island with lava and a couple of metres of rocks and slag. The island's 4500 inhabitants, including a young Gulli, were evacuated but, perhaps with few alternatives, returned after a year or so to dig themselves out and carry on.

We meet a sample, ten years on, stumbling back from the bar on a bitterly cold night. Life is tough: they squat in cramped, tumbledown shacks under the shadow of Eldfell, clinging by their fingertips to subsistence. We wonder: why do these people live like this, here, in this day and age? Because they are Vikings: over thousands of years they have adapted to this. This is who they are. This is what they know. These men play as hard as they live. They don't go in for interior monologue.

So, after a hard night out these latter-day longboatmen convene at daybreak at the wharf. The mooring ropes have frozen themselves to the bollards; the wind is so cold and dry it has leeched the very colour from the air. The men set out, cheerily enough: Gulli (lafsson) is a bear of a man, with an open face and a light disposition. He doesn't seem bothered by the cold. His crewmates are more taciturn, but you would be after a skin full like that.

We know their voyage is doomed, but there is no Shakespearian hubris: the crew's fatal flaw is nothing worse than failing to heed a warning: a couple of hours in, Breki snags her net on the bottom and all but capsizes. Careful, fellas. They're not, and a few miles further on she does it again. This time the winch release fails and she goes over.

Now let's just pause quickly and do a quiz: Imagine you want to film a sixty foot trawler capsizing in an angry sea. Do you: (a) call for Industrial Light and Magic or (b) get on board one with a SteadyCam and half a dozen actors, take the vessel out a couple of miles, roll the cameras and actually sink her? A bag of sweeties for you if you chose (b). An extra star if you decided to re-float the boat and sink her again because you didn't get the take you were after on the first go-round.

This is far from the only time Kormkur asks the impossible of his crew, and the results are simply magnificent. An overhead tight shot - a gull's eye view - of Gulli floundering in the heaving swell pulls up and out, wider and wider, until it is God's view, and Gulli is a pale blue dot in the middle of the screen: but a drop in the firmament.

To make the shot, lafsson must be at least 400 metres in any direction from any form of support crew. That's a long way to swim in any conditions, let alone the north Atlantic. When he finally washes up on the barbarous coast, the actor is dashed on the rocks like a rag doll. It's hard to credit lafsson wasn't mortally injured. And he's picked a bad landing spot, walled by unscalable cliffs. (Having at last made landfall, Gulli had to set out again and swim round the coast to get out of the water).

Gulli is a heroic inversion of Aguirre or Fitzcarraldo because in the face of overwhelming nature his reaction is humble: he seeks to survive not for personal vainglory, but to right his minor wrongs and make his peace with his small quarrels in his prosaic world. What with storms, volcanoes and fallen norse warriors there are biblical (and pagan) allusions throughout this film, but they are not there to proselytise as much as to remind us of the wisdom of simple humility in the face of nature.

Gulli's open face is imperceptibly changed - haunted - as he rehabilitates. He is uncomfortable with his celebrity, but agrees to undergo further tests in the name of science. They validate his story but are inconclusive as to how it could have happened.

In the end, the scientists resort to hand-waving and shoulder shrugging in lieu of good explanations, while Gulli struggles to come to terms with his profound experience in the context of his ordinary life, and in the end only does so by returning to what he knows best.

This nicely bookends Kormkur's major theme: sometimes events are bigger than all of us, but for each of us, the grandest drama is but a walk-on role in a far more epic saga which the rest of the world never sees. Life's morbid guarantee of the mundane is in equal parts our horror and our salvation.

The final shot is as profound as any others in a profound film: the 22 year old, his face at last exorcised of ghosts, boards a new boat and heads out in the colourless cold towards the monstrous sea.

8589279,5,B00D3XMHCU,"The first film of the first day of six weeks of press screenings (three per day, four days per week) was this amazing film submitted by Iceland/Norway. It has won numerous, well-deserved awards for acting, set design, production design, sound design, music and visual effects. This is a worthy entry for the 2013 Seattle International Film Festival.

""Dj&uacute;pi"" (English captions) is based on a real life incident in 1984 when a fishing boat capsized off the coast of Iceland. All hands on deck are thrown into the icy waters (temperature is 21 and the water is 41). As you may know, a person can usually survive a scant 30 or 40 minutes in northern waters, but we watch an amazing story as one man tries in vain to hail two passing boats, chats with a friendly sea gull, watches the Northern Lights, and makes promises to God if he can just live one more day. He does this for over six hours.

I toyed with the idea of listing the actors' and actresses' names, but their alphabet is somewhat different from ours and most of us can't pronounce them anyway, so suffice it to say, we saw terrific work that was utterly convincing. (Their names are on the Amazon ad, so they aren't really overlooked.)

The byplay of the crew feels authentic, e.g., one cautions another not to tell him how ""Jaws"" ends because he hasn't finished watching it yet. We watch (via newsreels) the volcanic eruption that Iceland experienced, as well as the aftermath, with citizens shoveling ash from their town.

When a film is based on real life, I always appreciate having the ""real"" person shown at the end of the film and this one includes excerpts from his interview! Hurrah!",1376524800,8,1659,4.651877133105802
