Dull, dull, dull...",1274227200,6,92,4.411764705882353
3537029,5,B001DR9NB6,"Harvey Korman introduced Tim Conway as, ""the funniest man alive!"" and I think that just might be the case! I just finished watching this gem of a video. Although Louise DuArt is good, the best thing about this video is Conway and Korman. They still had comedic chemistry on stage and both appeared to be trying to out ad-lib the other! I am terribly sad that I missed seeing these two live, but seeing them preserved on this film is the next best thing. As I am a filmmaker, of a sort, myself, I would give anything to have the likes of Tim Conway in a film of mine. He still has it! The video ends with The Dentist Sketch which has been updated a little since the television version, but it is still a real laugh getter! To my surprise, the Special Feature section contained a commentary track! Not only that but we can see the two of them in the corner commenting on the show. But get this, this is the great part, the commentary is just as funny as the show! So it's like getting three hours of great comedy for the price of a 90 minute video! I know I'm gushing a little here, but I'm just very happy with the product. Tim Conway even mentioned that, like me, Laurel and Hardy were two of his influences! One last thing I think that this is a pretty clean video and would be appropriate for a younger audience as well. Harvey Korman is missed.",1270425600,93,1347,4.245136186770428

3537039,2,B001DR9NB6,I was hoping that this would be full of their past skits together. What they did was to perform the skits again and they just weren't the same. Very disappointed.,1441584000,,162,4.433333333333334

3537047,5,B001DR9NB6,"I always enjoyed seeing Tim Conway and Harvey Korman when they appeared on the Burnett comedy specials,
but I was disappointed with this DVD.  They did not seem funny at all to me.  Their skits seemed so contrived that I
.wondered who wrote them.  I do not recommend this DVD to any one who liked the two on regular TV",1414022400,,318,4.266666666666667

If I had known that it was not going to be all Tim and Harvey, I would not have bought it!",1412985600,,250,4.297872340425532

3537060,5,B001DR9NB6,You just can't go wrong with this DVD. I had the privilege of seeing them doing this performance in 2005 and had to buy a copy of this when I saw it available. If your a fan of Tim Conway and Harvey Korman you'll love this DVD.,1399680000,,227,3.851063829787234

3537062,4,B001DR9NB6,I enjoyed most of this DVD.  The parts of it that I thought were funny were really funny. Brought back memories.  But there are some that are just OK.  I still think DVD is certainly worth getting.  Vintage Korman & Conway.,1392163200,,223,4.365853658536586

3537064,2,B001DR9NB6,"The DVD was a gift -- it was as good as expected until the last three tracks which were unreadable.

This was a LARGE disappointment, since it cut out the best sequence -- the DENTIST.

VERY UNHAPPY.

3537065,1,B001DR9NB6,I misunderstood the promotion and was hoping that it was outtakes from the old shows. This is not their best work and we did not even get through the entire disk.,1387238400,,162,4.258064516129032
3537066,2,B001DR9NB6,"The skits were good but Louise DuArt, while good at what she does, was given too much time.  It did not seem to be the impromptu comedy of Tim Conway and Harvey Korman as seen on the Carol Burnett show.  We were disappointed.",1386892800,,225,4.209302325581396

3537071,5,B001DR9NB6,bought as a Christmas gift for my brother -wh is a big Tim Conway and Harvey Korman fan. The material is classic and has some of the best skits from the much loved Carol Burnett show,1382313600,,182,4.083333333333333

3537073,5,B001DR9NB6,For those who remember The Carol Burnett show they are in for a real treat and may even remember some of the skits.  For those who are younger they  will find out how it is possible to be funny without vulgarity or nudity which seem to be a requirement for the here and now.  A real stress reliever that just costs your time.,1378771200,5,325,4.126984126984127
3537074,3,B001DR9NB6,Disappointed that there was another comic on this DVD.  Would  have preferred it to be all of Conway and Korman.,1378684800,10,112,4.55

3537076,1,B001DR9NB6,THERE WAS TOO MUCH OF THE OLD GUYS AND THEY SURE WEREN'T SO FUNNY ANYMORE PLUS THE FEMALE COMEDIAN WAS NOT WHO WE WANTED.,1367798400,2,121,4.083333333333333
3537077,5,B001DR9NB6,Very nice item. Would recommend this to others.  Pleased and can not wait to start watching it and sharing it with others. Funny men,1361232000,2,132,4.5

3537080,2,B001DR9NB6,"Growing up, who didn't love Tim Conway and Havey Korman - they were hilarious!  Purchased this DVD for memories and some laughs and barely had either.  Kind of disappointing.  The shipping was very quick and I was quite satisfied with the seller, just not the product.",1357084800,,268,4.782608695652174
3537081,2,B001DR9NB6,"I agree with Harvey Korman that Tim Conway is the funniest man in show business.  Sadly this dvd just doesn't prove it.  The best part of the dvd is when Tim does a mini monologue, but the skits with Harvey are tough to watch.  The special guest ""Louise Du'art"" is merely a time filler and takes away from the rest.

Save your money on this dvd and purchase one of Tim's ""Dorf's"" dvds.",1357084800,2,385,4.232876712328767

3537083,5,B001DR9NB6,This dvd is very funny and this is not TBS.  If you love to laugh I highly recommend this dvd. True comedians and they prove that you be funny without using all those foul curse words!!!,1354147200,,186,4.166666666666667
3537084,1,B001DR9NB6,"Did not like it at all.  Tim and Harvey come on at the very beginning and then another person, who I guess is suppose to be a comedian, comes on for a long time.  She wasn't funny at all.... in fact boring.  Tim and Harvey come on later but they're not that funny either.  It's not bits of skits that they've done in the past, it's whole skits and believe it or not, they're not funny.",1352937600,5,385,4.026315789473684
3537085,4,B001DR9NB6,"Having been a fan of the Carol Burnett Show and particularly Tim and Harvey's interaction on that show I set myself up for disappointment hoping for the same level of comedic hilarity.  Unfortunately, as they've aged they weren't quite able to deliver to the same level.  Still a fun trip down memory lane, but overall not a must have.",1344556800,4,335,4.661016949152542
3537086,4,B001DR9NB6,"I saw Tim Conway and Harvey Korman perform live and this DVD is pretty much how I remember the show - Tim & Harvey are fantastic, Louise DuArt slows things down. The reason to get this DVD is for the performances by Conway and Korman. Seeing them work together is always a treat as they obviously love what they're doing and have such a wonderful rapport with each other - and it's fun to see how long it will take Harvey to start laughing. Their commentary on the show is also fun to listen to (and watch since it's a video commentary as well).
As for DuArt,I know some people like her, but her sense of humor just doesn't match mine. I also don't like it when people doing impressions have to tell you who they're imitating. But enough of that. If you're a fan of Conway & Korman, I think you'll enjoy this DVD.",1309478400,26,813,4.251612903225807
3537087,5,B001DR9NB6,Not much to say. I saw the dentist skit in person in reno and would buy the dvd just for that.,1306108800,17,94,3.5238095238095237
3537088,5,B001DR9NB6,"TIM CONWAY AND HARVEY KORMAN  THIS DVD IS PRICELESS.

Unfortunately, every time I try to purchase Carol Burnett show collections, the episodes featured are not that funny, and she has a little talk show format reviewing episodes.  I just want episodes!!!
Carol, hire a better DVD content company.  Your fans want great episodes, we are willing to purchase them, and really don't want or need the reunion discussions.",1514937600,,464,5.22972972972973
