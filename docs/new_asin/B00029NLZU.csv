8024588,3,B00029NLZU,"This is a great story with interesting characters that actually have some depth. When I placed this movie in my netflix queue I did so not really knowing what I would get. A part of me thought I was going to get a somewhat stereotypical anime story of an ordinary boy who gets super powers. I was wrong. It's something that had a lot more complexity than written for the netflix description. Sadly the story doesn't go any further than these two episodes, it feels as if it is just the tip of the iceberg into a great series but it just ends and there are no more parts to this. If anything it feels like it was a teaser to get fans to pick up the manga just to get the full story, the only problem is that the manga is not available in the U.S. sigh.

If you MUST watch this, then get it from netflix don't actually pay for it.",1275091200,3,828,4.079754601226994

8024590,5,B00029NLZU,"it is unfortunate that more of the series was never released on to dvd. But read the manga or rather the scanilations, if you can. This series is awesome! And techniclly it is NOT YAOI. It is about two boys, yes, but it never crossed the line. which for some fans was rather disappointing, but it is still an awesome and exciting and a very BL-innuendo-y series. LOL read it. watch the dvd.",1258070400,7,390,4.3561643835616435
8024591,3,B00029NLZU,"Two years ago, another reviewer said to look out for a series follow-up -- Don't bother. There isn't one. Like so many others of its type, this OAV is stand-alone adaptation of an extremely long-running manga series that has not been released State-side. Whether or not it will be in the future, your guess is as good as mine.

The setting, story and characters are interesting and unique on their own. You're sucked in to a tale of magic and mystery, past lives, evil spirits and dark powers. I found myself rather excited for the next part, which I found out, to my disappointment, does not exist.

The art is serviceable, but has the feel of being a CLAMP wanna-be. It's solid, but a bit generic. Same goes for the audio quality.

The story has a lot of potential, which only makes it more painful when the OAV ends and the viewer is left hanging with the threads of a story that may never be translated into English.  To quote a review off another site: ""Eight Clouds Rising is a moody and atmospheric little two part prologue tale based on something much larger. The feeling that much is missing is there as this is a more compressed version of what probably made up several volumes of the manga. It's an interesting tale that when all is said and done you look at and wish that it would either be properly expanded or it piqued your curiosity enough to seek out the actual manga series itself. By itself, it's a cheap way to pass an hour but not something that you'll go back and repeatedly watch.""

My opinion: Don't spend the money on it. There are far better titles out there and this one will only leave you disappointed.",1162944000,18,1631,4.459731543624161
8024592,4,B00029NLZU,"Eight clouds rising is the story of two young men.  One is a college student who travels from Tokyo to a small shrine in the mountains during a festival that only occurs every 49 years in order to get his long dead grandfather's sword purified.  The other is the 16 year old son of the temple's highest priest, who has strange and dark powers and becomes the wielder of one of 7 sacred swords.

It is comprised of two 30 minute parts, and the ending, while completing a piece of the story, is by no means a resolution.  We can probably expect a series, or at least another video in the future.",1093046400,16,593,4.267857142857143
