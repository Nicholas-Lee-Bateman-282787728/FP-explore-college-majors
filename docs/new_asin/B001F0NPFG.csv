The video sparked my memory of the most efficient way of approaching these difficult low back and hip pain symptoms. If I would have watched this earlier I am sure that I would have helped more people recover from their chronic pain faster.

Thanks for such a great video!",1303776000,3,384,4.818181818181818

8300164,5,B001F0NPFG,"I ordered this DVD after receiving the upper extremity mobilization DVD and reviewing it.
Initially, I was a little perturbed that the teaching format was a little different from the upper extremity, but after seeing it all, it makes a lot of sense.
Doug presents the information thoroughly and clear.
