7310778,5,B010GBASQS,"If you have the other Yoda Chronicles, and the other Lego-Star Wars videos, you have to get this one too! It has four complete long episodes, all done with the for-all-ages humor and cleverness of Lego. The best part is that Anthony Daniels, the original C-3PO actor, supplies C-3PO's voice for all of these Lego videos. He's great! Tom Kane voices Yoda on the Clone Wars series and does Yoda's voice here. He has really made Yoda a memorable character in the Clone Wars. Anyway, this video would be fun for kids and for adult Star Wars fans too!",1443312000,2,546,4.525252525252525

7310804,4,B010GBASQS,"Silly, family-friendly retelling of the Star Wars series, with goofy mix-ups of familiar characters and locations (e.g. Han and Chewie scope out Hoth and end up suspended from the frozen ceiling of the Wampa cave, etc.) Great to hear Anthony Daniels lending his voice to C3P0 again, including a wacky, more aggressive (and subsequently short lived) character redesign which was funny to see. John Williams music is taken from all of the original films to pad out all of this nonsense.",1454716800,,484,4.987654320987654

7310806,5,B010GBASQS,"What a fun series!  All of my family thought it was histerical!
Loads of good laughs, from the youngest to the oldest.
Lots of good gags for the younger kids, and if the old folks are paying attention, there are a bunch of little gags that Star Wars fans would get.

Great series!",1451520000,,280,4.264150943396227

7310811,5,B010GBASQS,"As someone that has always been a fan pf star wars, this series is so much fun and you can tell that the creators are also having a ton of fun with it too. This DVD has four great episodes that include:

1) Escape from the Jedi Temple - Luke gets his friends into some trouble and Yoda and the ghost of Obi-Wan decide they need to take his training to another level.

2) Race for the Holocrons - Luke searches for sacred crystals that could help him complete his training.

3) Raid on Coruscant - Luke raids the Coruscant to get the Holocrons back from the emperor.

4) Clash of the Skywalkers - The Emperor sends Darth Vader and his whole force to destroy Luke and recover the Holocrons

All four of these episodes were fun and you get to have a ton of fun with the characters as they go on adventures. The plots of the stories are entertaining and stay true to the Star Wars universe too. If you are a Star Wars fan you will love this DVD.

7310815,5,B010GBASQS,My two boys ages 4 and 6 love all the Lego Star Wars movies.  Even in my 40s I love these movies as well.  They are hilarious and keep the kids attention.  This new Yoda Chronicles DVD is a very good deal as there are many short movies on the DVD.  My kids watch this numerous times a week while we are in the car on longer drives.  I highly recommend adding this one and the three other Star wars lego movies to your collection.,1446076800,3,429,4.0
7310816,5,B010GBASQS,"My kids have watched this a dozen times already.  Being Star Wars fans and Lego fans, this really fit the bill.  I've watched it a few times with them and I admit that I laughed out lout a couple times.  It's worth buying.

7310819,5,B010GBASQS,"Thank you Disney for sending us this DVD to review!

Almost everyone likes Star Wars and kids love Legos.  So mixing them together is a match made in heaven.  Add in everyone's favorite characters with their famous lines, a solid script, and it'll be 92 minutes well spent.  The humor in this series had both kids and adults cracking up.

Darth Vader had many funny moments with his voice getting messed up due to a short in his wiring.  His cape also got in his way often and choked him while flying his pod racer.  Another great moment was when he scolded a storm trooper for being clumsy and then tripped over him!  I dare say that these episodes are more entertaining than the original movies.

Here's a synopsis of the four episodes in this DVD:

Escape From The Jedi Temple - Luke and his friends are nearly captured by Darth Vader and after they escape, Yoda and Obi-Wan's ghost believe that further training with the help of the Holocrons is required.

Race For The Holocrons - Luke Skywalker needs to retrieve the Holocrons that Obi-Wan hid to complete his Jedi training.  Darth Vader is looking for them as well.  Who will get to them first?

Raid On Coruscant - With the Holocrons in their possession, the Sith empire can locate and root out the Rebel Alliance.  The Rebel Alliance must fight back to re-claim the Holocrons.

Clash Of The Skywalkers - After the Sith's defeat, the Sith set out on a mission to put an end to Luke Skywalker for once and for all.

My kids and I are now officially fans of this series and highly recommend checking it out on TV or in its DVD form.  The DVD sells for less than $13 on Amazon and is worth every penny.",1443830400,,1657,4.412541254125412
