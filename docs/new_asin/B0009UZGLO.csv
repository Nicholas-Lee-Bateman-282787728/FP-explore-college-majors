2322710,4,B0009UZGLO,"I wasn't too sure how well I would enjoy this film, but I have been a Peter Coyote fan for over 25 years, and have enjoyed Michael T. Weiss' work as well.

I was really impressed with the acting and story line, but I felt it would have been better as a pilot for a t.v. series than just a film.

I do reconmend it though.  Kept me on the edge of my seat.",1228176000,4,354,3.7567567567567566
2322711,4,B0009UZGLO,"This movie is well acted. Great plot. Really cool flick. Michael T Weiss is great in this role. Really has an edge.
 Peter Coyotoe is always great and special nod for Gwen McGee (Coach Carter, Clearing)who stood out as Weiss boss, Captian Streeter,",1193011200,3,248,4.767441860465116
2322712,1,B0009UZGLO,"Michael T. Weiss (The Pretender & Bones) stars as Matt Ransom, a detective who's marriage to his wife Mary, played by Nancy Valen is going down the shoot. Worse, his partner John Traveller, played by Peter Coyote (The 4400, Sphere),  is being convicted of murdering the son of detective Luke Williams, played by Steven Rankin (The One, Blue Streak). This lands John in jail which leaves Matt in a rut. His wife splits up with him after this and his boss played by Gwen McGee (The Clearing, Frailty) doesnt think he can handle his cases. Soon there happens to be multiple murders happen which just so happen to interconnect with the other case that the police are investigating. Matt goes to John in prison to help him find out who this ""Sherlock Holmes"" killer (which is corny all by itself) is because the killer leaves passages from some of the books. Matt also starts to get involved with John's daugher Jude Traveller played by Maureen Flannigan (At Any Cost, Tv's Starved). Soon, this case leads Matt down twists and turns at every corner and eventually ending up to finding out who the real killer is. Intriguing and suspenseful? No! Not the least. Weiss' acting in this is pure stupidity. He renders in on stiff and completely wooden and dull grunting and stuff, it gets irritating. He's not like his character in The Prender series. He's really bad. Coyote is wasted along with all the other supporting actors in their roles.  Save your money, avoid this at all costs. Also starring Dan Gauthier (One Life To Live, Groom Lake) and Jennifer Jostyn (Dr. Benny, Deep Impact).  To end, Written In Blood shouldnt of been written at all.",1143936000,7,1639,4.723776223776224

8066998,4,B0009UZGLO,"I am a fan of Michael T. Weiss, and I was not disappointed with this movie.  I read the reviews before ordering and have to agree with the ones that said some of the conflicts were left unresolved.  Overall though, the main part of the movie was resolved.  Besides the hair, Michael is dreamy!  If you are a fan it's worth the time.",1487808000,,332,4.222222222222222

8067001,4,B0009UZGLO,"Synopsis:

It's difficult to actually like any of the main characters, as the film goes on it becomes easier but the audience still has to work at it. The main character Mathew Ransom's marriage is on the rocks partly due to his job as a detective of some flavor. His partner John Traveller s going through hell with his own spouse and things generally sorta suck. Ransom receives a strange call from Traveller and all hell breaks loose. Traveller is charged and convicted of the murder of his wife and her lover - the son of another officer (the level of dysfunction in this department must be hilariously awful). Ransom reluctantly accepts that Traveller is guilty after he is convicted on two counts of first degree murder. Meanwhile Traveller's daughter starts putting the moves on him as his marriage has devolved to a legal separation. After Traveller's conviction a series of Sherlock Holmes themed murders targeting his enemies on the outside occur. Ransom true to form and cliche starts investigating under the radar. It's not exactly a novel set up and it tries to smoosh too much into its run time. Eliminating the subplot of Ransom's failing marriage would have uncluttered things.

Cons:

The movie isn't really that bad it just has too much going on, sporadic casting, limited chemistry, fairly predictable writing and a general case of jerkitis running rampant among its characters.

Re: the jerkitis - Ransom pointlessly swears, shouts or screams at basically everyone, drinks hard liquor in every other scene and treats basically everyone around him like garbage and he's the hero. His partner is a self-satisfied passive jerk (though his passivity in the face of prison is actually explained which is nice) that constantly gives Ransom s*** for not supporting him in the face of forensic evidence and a double murder conviction, Ransom's lieutenant is a shouty cliche, his rival at work is another shouty hotshot cliche, and his love interest is about as deep and interesting as a parking lot puddle.

Pros:
Fans of Michael T. Weiss will enjoy it. It does have a pretty interesting plot though the dialogue and editing are meh and the ending is gutsy if not exactly creative. Fans of Sherlock Holmes may get a kick out of the vengeful murderer plotline and the actress playing Ransom's wife does well in their scenes, the two are the only performers with chemistry and they do a good job of displaying the erosion of a once loving relationship in only a handful of scenes.

Conclusion:

Grab some wine and have a nice rental you don't have to worry about returning in the morning.",1408665600,,2598,4.864253393665158
8067002,4,B0009UZGLO,"This was a great movie!  Michael T. Weiss was fabulous as always.  (He created a great character, used his voice as an alcoholic very effectively, got your sympathy and annoyance with his character.  Always an amazing actor without nearly enough great roles.)  The script could have used the Sherlock Holmes angle a bit better.  The acting was great.  I especially liked the secretary (watch for her, very understated but a lot of fun!)  Only drawback is Michael T. Weiss didn't take off his shirt enough (that is a bonus directors should use in every film he is in!  That man's body is truly a work of art!).",1405209600,,609,4.626168224299065
8067003,1,B0009UZGLO,"This movie is a candidate for the worst movies conceived, written, and acted. The camera shots are almost all done on one of those strap-on cameras where every shot moves around. I guess the director was trying to create some 'drama' and 'tension' in the scenes. All it does is make you feel sea-sick.
But, by far, the worst part of this movie is the actor that plays the main character (I can't be bothered to look up his name, or the main character's name. Too much wasted time).
DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS MOVIE, AND, CERTAINLY DO NOT SPEND $$$$$$$$ RENTING IT. Go buy a latte instead. It's better use of the money.
Too bad there are no rotten tomatoes to review this with.....",1404518400,,676,4.459677419354839
8067004,4,B0009UZGLO,This was a good story plot and the acting was pretty decent.  I would recommend this for renting; not sure it's worth the cost to buy it.,1390089600,,137,4.074074074074074
8067005,5,B0009UZGLO,"The DVD came in perfect shape, no scratches no nothing. Great quality and as promised in time as desired. Sweet price, specially for us who life not in the home country at the moment.",1344384000,,183,4.411764705882353
8067006,4,B0009UZGLO,"This video has all its tickets punched! You have well defined bad and good guys; you have love interests, jealousies, revenge, uncontrollable hatred, sex, marital cheating, divorced wife problems and rage. It also has a smooth flowing story line with a couple of small twists throughout and at the end. It offers ""foreshadowing"" so (if you are clever) you could figure it out, and enough misdirection to throw off the novices. In a few words, it holds your interest and has a realistically possible, if not likely ending. However, I wanted the video to last long enough to see our hero get back with his wife. Well maybe in the sequel down the line.",1318723200,,649,4.701754385964913
