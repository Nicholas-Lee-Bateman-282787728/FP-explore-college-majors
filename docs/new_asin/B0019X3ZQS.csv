3444534,5,B0019X3ZQS,"The video came exactly on time, and was just as described! Completely brand new and unopened. I can't wait buy more them!",1354924800,,121,4.545454545454546
3444535,5,B0019X3ZQS,I purchased this item and game it to my sister for her birthday and she was ecstatic! We watched all the DVDs that night and were thrilled. We we're very happy about the DVDs.,1354579200,,175,4.176470588235294
3444536,5,B0019X3ZQS,"I've wanted to see this series for years and am glad that it is available at such low price. The content is definitely worth the money. Other anime series may have ups and downs, but this one doesn't have a dull moment. It takes an original premise--yakuza daughter teaching high school math to delinquents--and makes an ingenious execution. It is comedy, but there are still touching character moments. Recommended for anyone who wants to try something unique.",1330905600,,461,5.0
3444537,5,B0019X3ZQS,"I had watched this series over a friend's house and really enjoyed it-it's silly and it has yakuza in it. What's not to love? It is a bit short, only 13 episodes but it includes a blooper real for each dvd. That's about it for the special features, though. I got my set for just under $15 and I am very happy with it.",1316390400,,317,3.96875
3444538,5,B0019X3ZQS,"I am a huge fan of The Gokusen. I was tired of always trying to watch this show on the Internet with our horrible connection in this area. Buying this I was a little skeptical since quite a few products from other countries have horrible translations or dubs, but this one was great. The dubs makes sense and the translations are on par. The outtakes are a little strange and definitely not for children, but they don't harm the package in any way. I would recommend this set for anyone who likes the Gokusen and wants to see more of the manga rather than the live-action television show.",1308700800,,588,4.453703703703703
3444539,5,B0019X3ZQS,"This anime is funny!  It has one of the only dubbed versions that I actually loved!  The voice casting was really spot on for this one, the character's voiceovers matched perfectly well with the characater's personalities and original japanese voices.  This series is a great investment!  I would give it more stars if I could ^^",1305072000,,329,4.821428571428571
3444540,4,B0019X3ZQS,"I read it first, then I watched it, and still love the anime version. What I like about this particular video is the english dub, or sub capabilities. Other anime videos I've bought are dubbed and have no original voices. I like to hear the original or first voices sometimes. I'm used to reading subtitles, but if you are not and still want to enjoy this video, well...it is also dubbed!",1271030400,5,388,4.47887323943662
3444541,5,B0019X3ZQS,Purchased for my wife and she loves it. Thanks for having this item in your collection.,1265846400,2,87,4.5
8275517,3,B0019X3ZQS,"Really not the best adaptation at all. For one, it covers less than half of the manga, secondly they took a fairly serious & somewhat violent comic about yakuza life aimed at adult women & turned it into a censored & dumbed down school comedy aimed at young men, & most importantly, it cut out a lot of secondary character development, secondary character background stories, & plots about the yakuza in favor of filler about the school. Most of the fighting was axed & references to drugs were replaced by cat pins. There is a love triangle in the 2ed half of the manga that the anime teases but goes absolutely nowhere with.",1501804800,,626,4.548672566371682

8275519,5,B0019X3ZQS,I took this out of the packaging and it was positively glowing. It was so shiny. I really enjoy this anime!,1472169600,,107,4.142857142857143
8275520,5,B0019X3ZQS,Just like the TV show which I forget never had an ending that I enjoyed as it kinda just ended where you want more episodes.,1448928000,,124,4.0

8275526,5,B0019X3ZQS,"I love this anime. It cracks me up everytime I watch it. Its shorter than I wish it would be though. Really wish it could have had a second season! If you want a short comedy, then give this anime a try!",1370995200,,203,3.857142857142857
