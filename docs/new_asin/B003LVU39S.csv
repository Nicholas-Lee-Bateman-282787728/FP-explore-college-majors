4154120,2,B003LVU39S,I am a fan of the books and was excited to see it coming to life...I really didn't like it. Hated the cast. Totally not was I envisioned. I know most of the time storylines change but I was really disappointed.,1288310400,5,210,4.146341463414634
8399866,4,B003LVU39S,It was hokey.  I loved some of the characters and laughed at the others.  It had pieces of the book that were made better and others that missed the mark.  I hope there will be a fresh live version one day. Like how Shadowhunterd changed Mortal instruments series.,1503446400,,264,4.458333333333333

8399869,5,B003LVU39S,"yes it did meet my standards, however......where the heck is the rest of it? I can find NO other dvds other than this one....ANYWHERE! If this is the only one than i will have to change my statement to very disappointed because there is a whole lot missing.",1386806400,,257,4.375
8399870,2,B003LVU39S,Didn't really like this movie. It was short and skipped over a lot of stuff from the book. Wish I would have saved my money.,1380585600,,124,4.0
8399871,4,B003LVU39S,"I liked the movie but the characters were not what I imagined and I wish it would have followed the story line a little better, but what bothers me most is that at the end of the movie does anyone else understand the picture?!?",1370304000,2,227,4.181818181818182
8399872,5,B003LVU39S,"Despite the fact that this movie/ web episodes have received negative ratings, I actually like it just the way it is. I also like the acting. I understand that the movie is very different from the books but that's just fine with me.",1360281600,2,232,4.4186046511627906
8399873,1,B003LVU39S,"I ignored all the reviews because I hadn't read the books and thought it'd be ok if I didn't have any expectations. It's HORRIBLE and a huge waste of time. The acting is terrible, and Gossip Girl is way more entertaining.",1315612800,,221,4.414634146341464
8399874,1,B003LVU39S,"The show is horrible.  It is basically a big advert. for Neutrogena and the acting is terrible.  If you a fan of the books, you will be very disappointed with the show.",1300752000,8,168,4.21875
8399875,1,B003LVU39S,ok now you don't want to see this movie if you have not read all the books because its a combination of them all and its not how you may have planned.,1292889600,2,150,3.71875
