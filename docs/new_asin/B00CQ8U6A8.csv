5734675,5,B00CQ8U6A8,I love bad b movies and these take the cake as being the best b movies out there. I love them!,1385769600,2,94,3.5238095238095237
5734676,5,B00CQ8U6A8,Charles B. Pierce movies are so hard to find. This is one of my all time favorites. The dvd arrived 1 day ahead of schedule. I will be searching for other hard to find items from Richard Lynch. He has good prices for the hard to find items.,1383177600,,240,4.020833333333333
5734677,1,B00CQ8U6A8,"Some movies are so bad they are entertaining in their badness.  THE NORSEMAN just plain sucks.  Now I know that Lee Majors was no Larry Olivier, but I have NEVER seen him act worst than this movie.  He had the look of a guy who told himself, ""Hell it is a paycheck, I don't have to like it.""",1380240000,,291,3.9827586206896552
5734678,4,B00CQ8U6A8,"I have been waiting for ""The Norseman"" on DVD for quite some time. This is a cool movie that my brothers and I enjoyed watching back in the 80's. I am a fan of Lee Majors and this is one of his best features (I know he did not make many good ones).This is a cool and cheesy flick with an interesting cast, Cornel Wilde, Jack Elam, Denny Miller, Kathleen Freeman, Mel Ferrer and football great Deacon Jones. Cheesy fun.",1379116800,19,418,4.2375
5734679,4,B00CQ8U6A8,"Although The Norseman is presented correctly in 2.35 ascpect ratio on this DVD, The Barbarians is full frame instead of the correct 1.78. Fortunately not too much of the image is lost but it would have been good to know this before making the purchase.",1377734400,18,252,4.622222222222222
5734680,5,B00CQ8U6A8,"I would just like to point out that Amazon's movie description for ""The Barbarians"" is totally wrong. The ""queen"" is actually a queen of what we would consider a traveling carnival in medieval times. She is the ""keeper and protector"" of a ""belly stone ruby"" that the warrior king who captures her is after. The twins and the girl at the beginning of the movie, were in fact, orphans that she adopted into her tribe of traveling entertainers. When she is captured, so are the twins. The girl isn't heard from again. The twins are separated in the king's cruel kingdom and endure years of brutality. When they are older, bigger, and stronger, they are reunited and vow to free their queen from the imprisonment she has endured. They retrieve ancient sacred weapons and slay a dragon to recover the belly stone ruby and reunite their tribe and free them from the bondage that they have endured since their queen was taken from them.

On a personal note: I absolutely love this movie. Yes, it's cheesy as h**l, but it's soooo bad it's actually good.",1376438400,6,1045,4.648648648648648
5734681,5,B00CQ8U6A8,"WOW... I hate when people do reviews before they have the product, BUT...

I have held on to my 2 crusty vhs tapes of the BARBARIAN BROTHERS for a LONG time.

I used to watch this film when I was like 6 years old and it made me workout and get into

martial arts to this day 20 years later. I wanted to be Conan or one of the barbarians lol!

Shout Factory is absolutely surprising me every time I look on amazon.

Bringing out stuff like Cellar Dweller and etc... All I can say is Shout Factory is exceeded

any other company that buys rights and restores and brings back these films.

I cant wait to hear Donnaggio's main theme start playing after the infamous CANNON logo.

For those who are not familiar with the Barbarian Brothers movie, it is CHEESE, but it is

fun and Peter and Paul were roided out goofballs. Theres some gore, and Lynch is great as

a bad guy like always. I am sure the quality will be superb.

Sorry i cant provide info on the other film...",1373932800,29,967,4.201086956521739

5734684,5,B00CQ8U6A8,"i bought this two movie pack for the Barbarians.i like goofy movies that don't take themselves too seriously and this is one of those.there is constant comedy between the 2 barbarian brothers which makes it a fun movie.the story concerns a band of wandering minstrals who are attacked by a vicious king and his witch assistant.the brothers are taken at a young age and seperated,put to work in a mill. They get hugh muscles and are trained to kill each other by captures wearing masks.put in a stall to fight to the death because the king wants to get back at the queen of the ministrals he captured and who has spurned his real love for her.they discover the plot in a fight to the death and escape to restore the magic and their queen to the band of minstrals.there are ghost and a dragon to battle and finally the evil king in a great battle.this is a very good action-comedy picture to be enjoyed for the fun,just don't expect an academy award picture",1488931200,,955,4.494252873563219

5734696,3,B00CQ8U6A8,"The Norseman, saw it once as a kid back in the 80's, it's not as good as I remember it, now it's just kinda funny.

First viking to be killed gets it by an arrow in the butt with a slow-mo deathscene, how cool is that, and the outfit looked like something from an roman sandalmovie""epic"" from back in the fifthies, there's an african viking, an viking shaman (Jack Elam) who predict things as they happen and that viking ship WOW, I mean do you remember the tent Hermione had in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows well that's how the viking ship felt like when the scenes happen below the deck then it feels like they are in a battleship.

The story, well a young boy Eric soon to be a famous viking sets out west with his older brother to find their father, we find out that the father who set out west years ago lived with the natives in harmony and has taught them to make vine ? and what not and now is not in harmony anymore because of jealousy between a native warrior and a viking about a native girl and now the father and his remaining men being held as blinded slaves making vine to the natives in a cave ? and the adventure becomes a rescue mission with alot of heroic very bad slow-mo action.

Back in the days all was panscanned in VHS-cassettes, this is presented 2.35:1 widescreen.

Watch it with moviebufffriends and beer it's guaranteed unintentional laughs !",1444003200,2,1378,4.3501945525291825

Now, you might ask why. It's simple, low budget and the acting is mediocre but I have always been a fan of Charles Pierce, the producer of this film. He is famous for making low budget films which tell simple stories of good and bad. The good guys are really good and the bad guys are really bad. I also like his son, Chuck Pierce who appears in most of his films. He's a real cutie. The cinematography is always top notch and a lot of work goes into the costuming. In fact a lot of time and effort is always put into the small things and always make watching his films a delight. If I were to make a movie about something, I'd make them like Charles Pierce did.",1425945600,3,831,4.2

5734706,4,B00CQ8U6A8,"The Barbarians is a cult fantasy movie that stars the charismatic ""Barbarian Brothers"" who were raised as slaves and grow to become great barbarians. The brothers grow to become strong and plow through enemies with ease, and kill bad guys. The brothers are huge pumped up bodybuilding monsters that could take on Conan. The brothers are fun, and they like to joke around and argue with each other making it more of a lighthearted movie. This movie is not to be taken too seriously as it's a b movie with good, but not great quality picture full screen. I'm not sure why it's rated R, it's definitely not hard R as there is not much gore, cussing, or nudity in it. All these old 80s fantasy movies need a blu ray release, especially for the fans that appreciate sword and sorcery type fantasy films.

The Vikings was a nice added bonus to this movie set that I didn't expect. Lee Majors stars in the film as he leads The Vikings on their sea voyage across the globe. They set sail the seas and end up in Vineland(America) where they battle the Vineland Indians in a low budget spectacle. This movie is just pure action and adventure fun. This movie is no history class, just pure imagination, and cheesy B film entertainment. I enjoy it for what it is, low budget, and it was better than what I thought it would be though. Overall, I was happy with what I got here in this 2 film set.",1422489600,,1383,4.40234375

5734709,3,B00CQ8U6A8,Fan to Eva larue movies and like back to back movies never seen in long time back 80s. Movie is so clear good pic. But wish part that shouldn't be to dark contrast like when in cave or indoors forrest go thru in movie. I have watch the barbarians online and clear pics and not to dark contrast. Im Still looking for the barbarians by it self on DVD. Not double features. One thing it play but it won't pause and skip or skip back just play only eject disc is turn off player and turn on eject. So I give this one to my cousin. And I'm still looking for the barbarians by self on DVD.,1411776000,2,583,3.9914529914529915
