6477904,5,B00L9OPIDU,"Can't wait for this one. I still have some VHS tapes of the Midnight Special that I can finally retire. The lineup is a great cross section of mostly rock and soul stars (Tom Petty, Doobie Brothers, Peter Frampton, ELO, The Cars, Blondie, Marvin Gaye, Curtis Mayfield, War, etc.) and the occasional country cross-over star (Charlie Rich, Crystal Gayle). More than 500 acts performed over 3,000 songs on the show over a decade. This 6DVD set collects 96 of the best, most iconic performances. Standouts include Peter Frampton and his ""talking"" guitar on ""Show me the Way,"" a very-young Tom Petty on two great early songs (including ""American Girl""), a punkish take on ""One Way or Another"" by Blondie, War tearing it up on ""Cisco Kid,"" Todd Rundgren doing ""Hello It's Me"" in the most outrageous stage outfit this side of Bootsy Collins, and many, many more.
Some poignant performances by those stars who have left us include a cool Robert Palmer (""Bad Case of Loving You""), Mama Cass, Ray Charles (performing with Aretha Franklin), Maurice and Robin Gibb in the Bee Gees, and the transcendent Marvin Gaye on classic, ""What's Going On.""  Occasional Emcee Wolfman Jack injects excitement whenever he appears.
Midnight Special was the first network television show that ""put the artists first,"" and provided recording-studio-quality audio for both the studio audience and those watching at home. Every performer knew it was a big career moment to be asked by music industry titan Burt Sugarman to appear on this show and virtually all of them deliver defining performances. Plus the stage outfits (for those of you who were not around in the 1970s: these are not Halloween costumes, and, yes, people wore crushed velvet bell bottoms in public) and hair styles are simply mind-boggling.
Midnight Special was a ground-breaking music showcase and it is great to have these performances to enjoy again. Most importantly, with your DVD player, you can watch and listen at ant time of day...not just in the wee hours of Sunday morning.
Highly recommended.",1409184000,20,2044,5.011764705882353
6477905,5,B00L9OPIDU,"OMG-I can't believe this is out! I used to watch Midnight Special when I was babysitting as a teen.

6477929,2,B00L9OPIDU,The only reason I'm giving this such a low rating  is because it is not the Midnight Special TV show. When I say that I mean it shows the musical performances which you can see on YouTube; but it does not show the actual TV show from start to finish and that's what I wanted to see. Very disappointing. The musical performances are good but like I say you can see all of them on YouTube.,1487635200,,387,4.092105263157895

6477943,4,B00L9OPIDU,"THE MIDNIGHT SPECIAL: Although this ultimate seventies after hours party claimed to be a live program, a quick peek through its multi disc contents reveal some obvious exceptions to that rule. While the majority of stars (AEROSMITH, JOAN BAEZ, WAR, EDGAR WINTER, ARETHA FRANKLIN, ALICE COOPER, HARRY CHAPIN, THE BEE GEES) put on mini concerts, OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN and the BAY CITY ROLLERS are certainly lip synching, and TODD RUNDGREN and GOLDEN EARRING are singing over canned backing tracks. Disco segments from PEACHES & HERB and CHIC are mimicked as well (ala AMERICAN BANDSTAND), as is BLONDE's dance smash HEART OF GLASS...compare its robotic slickness to their ragged live take of ONE WAY OR ANOTHER later in the same show. Although only fractions of the original episodes are spotlighted, the sheer variety of music...hard rock, folk, funk, country, easy listening and soul...is staggering, much like AM radio play lists during this glorious era. THE MIDNIGHT SPECIAL includes a bounty of extras (interviews, mini-documentaries, bonus tracks) and it's a nostalgic thrill checking out the hairstyles, fashions (NEIL SEDAKA in a ""Smoke Columbian"" shirt?) and over the top show biz attitude of your favorite musicians during pop music's pre-MTV phase.

6477951,3,B00L9OPIDU,The performances are a time capsule of the era and are good. The audio and video quality is also. The problem with this and other Time-Life produced products is the editing.

I was disappointed cause there was a lot of the same performers. I was hoping there was more of a variety. Three Dog Night, Grassroots, the Monkees would if been great.  All you need to buy is the 6 disc set. The 11 disc is same of what is in the first 6 set. Although the comedy disk is pretty good. Billy Crystal , Richard Pryor are funny.

I cannot imagine why people would think that they would be receiving the entire episodes. These are clips of the various episodes and they segue seamlessly into the next performance with the original introductions intact. After watching the original series so many decades ago, this set has been a joy to watch--even our teenagers love it! Even after viewing it, just popping in the discs from time to time to listen while working around the house has been great, too.

6477963,3,B00L9OPIDU,"Had Don Kirshner's Rock Concert not come during the same time frame ( 73 - 81 ) I think I would
have like Midnight Special better.
I like John Denver just fine. But I like the the Rolling Stones much better ( openers for the first Rock Concert ).
It really just comes down to ones taste. Eagles, Frank Zappa, Allman Brothers, George Harrison, UFO,
David Bowie, Edgar Winters Band and many many more. We had gone through a cooler and the other before
Midnight Special came on. :)

I like this set well enough except it is a bit helter skelter on some parts. Some artists just didn't get much
air time at all. Midnight Special had a much different style of music and artists for the most part than
Rock Concert but they were good quality artists. Being different is a good thing. Neither were boring by
any stretch. Just different styles. All had good voices. Not always the case on Rock Concert but many more
screaming guitars. :)
To my knowledge Rock Concert has never been released and knowing Kirshner estate it may never be. So it is
great to have Midnight Special. Because it is a keeper and brings back a lot of memories.
To have two shows of that quality back to back for that many years we were a very fortunate generation.",1454112000,7,1230,4.394736842105263
6477964,4,B00L9OPIDU,"This is a fantastic set.  The sound quality is good and video quality was impressive.  I thought I would start with that as many I am sure wonder, like I did.  I have seen many of these videos on You Tube like some of you have and I was really hoping the quality would be better on the actual discs.  They are, by far.

These discs do not include full episodes. These are basically highlight discs where you see the artists performing their songs and not much more.  I just like the fact that each and every song is performed live,  I watched this a few times growing up but was into other things at that time.  The songs seem complete and this set generally sticks to the Top 40 and pop for the time frame the show was on.  Of course, Top 40 back then did include rock, country, disco, glitter, soul and new wave.

I have watched only 3 discs so far and have not been disappointed.  Even a couple of songs I was not familiar with, I enjoyed.

Why 4 stars instead of 5?  I am not into the comedy aspect.  I see that as more of a bonus and really bought this for the music performances.  Out of 11 discs, only 8 have music.  The others include a comedy discs and interviews.

The extras on the discs that have music have been interesting as they contain additional performances and interviews.  The interviews were short, cut to the chase and not drawn out.

I saw advertised on one of the discs that The Midnight Special had over 1,500 artists and over 3,000 songs were performed.  This set has maybe 175 songs?  That is disappointing but I do appreciate what is included.  It leaves you wanting more.  I really hope we have not seen the last of The Midnight Special disc sets.  I hope they put out a Blu Ray set with the entire series of the 350 shows (I believe is what I read) in their entirety.  I know I am not alone in wanting to see this happen.",1452556800,29,1852,4.193181818181818

It's amazing to see all the artists performing the songs I listened to in the backseat of my parents station wagon. What a great show. Get this set and enjoy the performances.

The performance by Billy Paul singing ""Me and Mrs. Jones"" was so awesome my wife and I watched 3 or 4 times. What a show the live audience got to see back in the 70's. Ted Nugent, Aerosmith, Eddie Money, (no relation) Gary Wright, Golden Earing, AC/DC, a young Sammy Hagar, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers were so good it was worth the price just for those performances. It only costs about 2 trips to the movies and was way better. If you went to high school in the 70's or early 80's I don't see how you won't love this DVD set.",1448409600,6,689,4.149253731343284

This is NOT true!  Several of the acts are obviously lip-synching.  Some acts are playing live for sure (Tom Petty and Aerosmith) some seem to be singing over pre-recorded tracks  (Golden Earring) and others are downright lip-synching to the official release (the Village People).

6477990,5,B00L9OPIDU,"Before MTV and YouTube, Midnight Special was virtually the only place on your TV dial where you could see killer performances by
all your favorite acts that are not lip-synched.
From the clothes and hair styles to featuring one of the best eras of popular music (pre-MTV 1970's-early '80's), this is the real deal.
I purchased the six DVD version, but unfortunately not at Costco, so I didn't get the bonus disc, but everything on here is pretty killer.
Sure there are a few acts that you might not care that much about, but the ones that you do are captured in their prime. Plus Wolfman Jack, the greatest DJ of all time, is the host.
How can you go wrong? You can't! A must have...",1411516800,6,683,4.428571428571429
6477991,4,B00L9OPIDU,"A great show of when music was all encompassing of all styles. And I agree with the fellow reviewers about buying it at Costco for the much lower price and the extra DVD. So why 4 stars? there were many huge stars left off this with huge hits of that ERA but were on the previously sold package years ago thru Time Warner. So what I recommend you buy this from Costco and then buy from Amazon the individual DVDs for each year like ""1979"" and ""More 1979"", in my case, because those later years had great artists of the 80's that are missing! I was amazed that they omitted Journey, Nick Gilder ""Hot Child in the City,"" and Ian Hunter! and another performance from ""The Cars."" So read the reviews for the individual; years for those performances. You may find that favorite omitted artist of yours and the individual DVDs range from $6 to $26.",1410480000,12,842,4.403846153846154

6477993,5,B00L9OPIDU,"The Midnight Special was released as a mail order, multiple-installment DVD subscription about 7 or 8 years ago. Although a lot of footage from that collection is being repeated with these new releases, it does not include it all. It does, however, include some never-before-released performances. Time-Life has released the full song listing for their 11-disc set. I still can't seem to figure out exactly what is on this 6-disc set.

The 11-disc set includes about 90 previously-released clips, but also 41 new performances! Here is a list of the never-before released footage for the 11-disc set. Hopefully, some or all of this will be on this 6-disc set for those of us who don't want to purchase the entire 11-disc set:

Update:
As mentioned elsewhere in this forum, Costco is offering this set with a Bonus 7th disc for $28.99!! This is really a terrific deal. The presentation of the clips is much improved over prior releases as well. They are constructed in the semblance of the actual episodes. For instance, although they are heavily edited overall, each ""episode"" includes many of the original host intros, end credit sequences and band performances. Gone are the heavy title banner graphics and generic music that buffered each clip on earlier releases. Johnny Rivers' Midnight Special theme is back where it belongs as well.

Many, but not all, of the newly released footage I listed above is included in the 7-disc set. Much of what is missing is contained on Disc 7 & 8 of the 11-disc set.

The really good news is that the bonus 7th disc from Costco really IS exclusive footage! It contains several songs that don't appear on any other releases, including the 11-disc set. The 7-disc set also seems to include many of the featurette extras (interviews, etc.) as bonus features on each disc (there's a great little interview with Peter Frampton, for instance, accompanying the disc with his appearance). The tracks for the bonus disc are:

Electric Light Orchestra - Telephone Line
Andy Gibb - I Just Want to Be Your Everything
Leo Sayer - When I Need You
The Emotions - Best of My Love
The O'Jays - Back Stabbers
The Honey Cone - Want Ads
Brewer & Shipley - One Toke Over the Line
The O'Jays - Love Train
Kool & The Gang - Hollywood Swinging
Brownsville Station - Smokin' in the Boys Room
The Main Ingredient - Just Don't Want to Be Lonely
Gladys Knight & The Pips - Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me
Ohio Players - Skin Tight
Kool & The Gang - Jungle Boogie
Eddie Money - Two Tickets to Paradise",1410134400,107,4303,4.4199243379571245
6477994,5,B00L9OPIDU,Awesome!  These are so fun to watch.  I only remember seeing a few of these when they were on but I'm glad they are available to see now.  Rock and Roll history!  Best of all they were not lip synching on this show.,1410048000,7,215,3.9302325581395348

8664685,3,B00L9OPIDU,Blurred images. Poor sound quality,1531612800,,34,6.0
8664686,5,B00L9OPIDU,"There is a lot more going on here than meets the eye. First a little history. In 2006-2007 A total of 19 DVD 's were released by Guthy-Renker. Each DVD had about 15 songs. In 2014 Time-Life Released a new compilation of DVD's. A 1 DVD, 3 DVD, 6 DVD, 7 DVD (Costco Only) With Disc 7 exclusive to that set only. And then an 11 DVD set. Only 8 of the 11 Containing Songs. It would be easy to say the newer set just updated and added some songs but this is NOT the case. The mastering is very different. Many songs that are the same on both sets have different intros, some are taken from re-broadcast etc. Some are a mystery as to why they have different stars doing the intro for the same performance. Some songs that are on the old set and the new set are different performances! For example Bad, bad Leroy is a different performance, Brother Louie , Linda Ronstadt You're No Good, The Hollies Long Cool woman, Blondie Heart of Glass, Peaches & Herb Reunited are just some examples of the same song but different performances. New does not always mean better, some songs are trimmed on the newer Time-life sets. Example Ted Nugent Cat Scratch is missing the first 30 seconds on the new set. The start of Joan Baez The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down is cut short on this 11 DVD set. They even cut out portions from the Mama Cass/John Denver segments from the 1972 pilot episode. It is longer on the old 2006 DVD's! Picture quality is usually better on the new set but not always. Lots of songs on the new set are taken from (Best-of) shows and lost a generation in quality. The new set offers no 5.1 option that does help a few songs. The new sets are all made on single layer DVD's. The older DVD's have about 1/2 of them pressed on more expensive Dual-Layer DVD's. Why do I know all this? I ripped my DVD copies to combine them by year and started noticing all the differences and there are 100's. You will have to do some research for correct dates, the liner notes are for the episode air-date and NOT tape-date. The anniversary and million seller shows have songs from multiple years mixed together, so don't go by the booklet. On quality, I checked the bit-rate on disc 1 from the 11 DVD set and it only averages about 4.5 mbps, and that is very low and shows it should have been pressed on a dual-layer DVD. The new set does not have a big logo at the start of each song, but this can be cut out if you want to do it. The 7 DVD set from Costco has that exclusive 7th DVD with 7 songs out of 15 that can't be found anywhere else, but the first 6 DVD's will be exact duplicates to the first 6 DVD's in the 11 DVD set! Nice marketing... This big 11 DVD set has extras with Stars talking about their memories of the show and their favorite songs performed on The Midnight Special, and guess what? most of the songs they remember are not even on this 11 DVD set. Example, The O'jays talk about ""Back Stabbers"" as a favorite but where is it? only found on the Bonus Disc from Costco! same with ""Love Train"" also they promote ""where else can you see Fleetwood Mac doing ""Rhiannon"" Well not on this 11 DVD set, you have to go back to the original 19 DVD's 1976 disc to find it. So why even mention it? Frampton is interviewed about ""Do you Feel"" an 11min performance, but again it's only on the old set.  Melissa Manchester is interviewed in Length about ""Midnight Blue"" , but it's not on the 11 DVD set you are watching her talk about it! but it can be found on the 2006 DVD's.  Kool and the Gang talk about ""Hollywood Swinging"" and Jungle Boogie and show clips from the songs, but they are not on the set you are watching them talking about it ,they on that exclusive bonus 7th disc  from the Costco set, and that set from Costco does not contain these interviews about the songs. You should hear Eddie Money go on and on about ""Two Tickets to Paradise"" but it's  only found on that Bonus Costco Disc. And even then they cut off the intro from Journey's Steve Perry, that is found complete on the old 2006 DVD's! Someone got confused when assembling the sets. The old DVD's contain segments from comedians that range from about 5-7 min per DVD x 17 Disc. The New 11 DVD set has a separate DVD of comedy but the two sets contain different segments. Some are the same, but I have not studied these as close as the music . So, this review is not saying that any of the disc are bad, just that you have to collect like 37 DVD's to get it all! With the first 6 from the 7 DVD Costco set being duplicates that you won' t need but have to buy in order to get the bonus 7th DVD. Just saying...",1530921600,3,4585,4.195011337868481
8664687,1,B00L9OPIDU,Very few performances by only a few stars and A LOT of history concerning the show and biographical information about Wolfman Jack. I bought this because I remember watching the show and wanted to see what I watched when I was in my late teens and early 20's. This DVD was a great disappointment and a total waste of money.

There are also at least a couple of lip sync performances included - Blondie, Heart of Glass, and Robert Palmer, Bad Case of Loving You... .
