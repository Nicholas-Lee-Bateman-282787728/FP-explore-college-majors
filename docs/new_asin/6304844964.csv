They should immediately donate their living organs (eyes, heart, liver, etc.) to the less fortunate, as they clearly are incapable of using them to enjoy  this great accomplishment.  Perhaps your eyes will better serve  ""Karin,"" a hypothetical 22 year old college student.  She lost  her sight when she was 16 in a home fireworks accident, but she still  desperately wants a Masters degree in film.  She struggles every day to  make sense of her disfigurement.  Give her your eyes, I say!  Upon opening  them I will play The Ice Storm for her.  After being instantly revitalized  by it's cinematic powers, Karin will go on to win 3 Best Director Oscars, 2  Best Original Screenplay Oscars, and receive 8 other various nominations.
You, on the other hand, can't even enjoy The Ice Storm.  What a waste.  If you're not going to enjoy the most wonderful of films for STUPID reasons  (ex. you don't think the characters are ""realistic...""  ... uh,  what the heck do you know, anyway?), you should at least fry up some bacon,  and eat it.",936403200,2,1102,4.724867724867725
936463,4,6304844964,"I thought this movie had a pretty good depiction of the 3 major stages, that we as curious beings go through. Adolescence, Teen's, and Mid-Life;  All are tied together through one common factor.... Sex.  I was only  disappointed to see that Katie Holmes did not have a bigger part in the  film.  -Joshua Jarvis",925862400,,310,4.666666666666667
936464,4,6304844964,"Some fine performances lift a rather ordinary tale of disolving families set in the early seventies. there is a strong and sometimes too concious sense of period about the piece and together with some fairly horrible self  obsessed characters, this all perhaps comes across as being a little bit  too much of a scathing commentary of an era.  There is, perhaps naturally  enough, a coldness about the film and little sympathy is engendered for any  of the protagonists. But there were some nice observations and shafts of  humour and this was certainly one of the more enjoyable and interesting  releases during 1998",918432000,,616,4.980392156862745
936465,5,6304844964,"Director Ang Lee has created a hypnotic, visually dazzling movie about two families emotionally adrift during the changing mores of the early 1970s.  While parents aimlessly search for anything to give their lives meaning, they ignore the desperate needs of their own children, with tragic results.  Great performances from Joan Allen and Sigourney Weaver as two very different mothers and from Tobey Maguire and Christina Ricci as two of their adrift children.  The actual ice storm is so beautifully introduced and photographed that it actually becomes a memorable character in itself--one to be reckoned with and to be healed from.  The movie ends with a profound scene of father-son connection that is emotionally overwhelming and defines all the events that precede it.  Destined for classic status.

936520,5,6304844964,"I love Ang Lee and this movie is no exception to this others.  The setting is in the 70's, and the rapidly declining morals of society are entwined in this movie.  Kevin Kline and Joan Allen lead a family that is falling apart.  On a night in New England, as they go to a party that ends up a swinging party, the land becomes a crystal vision of ice and snow and wind.  I will forever see in my mind the beauty of the ice frozen on trees and how every aspect of nature is dripping in a diamond view of nature.  The ice storm is symbolic.  The frozen world and the frozen marriage of the couple plus the failure as parents that seem to just not improve is all in this symbolism.  This movie is not for action hounds.  The drama is for those who like a movie to make one think.",1469318400,7,775,4.019607843137255

936625,5,6304844964,"This is a wonderful movie. A little challenges with teens and some adults. I tried getting this for many years and months since I was 14 but I couldn't get it then. Every time I tried renting it, I had the bad feeling I did something wrong. What I did was right by renting this movie first and get approval before backing it up and buying a copy in my own home. I love Kevin with all my heart and he did fantabulous in this. At one scene where he passed out in the bathroom, I thought about what my mom said to me and she said that he's really good. (In acting that is). Then I said that personally, he continues to make stuff better than Johnny Depp or Jack Nicholson. I look straight into his eyes on screen as a youngster and a middle aged man and I can picture the looks we see today where his hair is all white and you see the signs of age in the face, neck, hands, etc. I thought a lot about my parents and what life is like in the 70's and it's a good thing I didn't exist then because I would've gotten into technology when I get to be halfway towards the end of my life. Instead I existed in the mid 1990's and technology came around at the right time in my teens and adulthood. I give it a 5 stars. I also had to think of Ang Lee's latest movie Life of Pi.

From the rest of the bratty kids, to the bed-hopping, to the idiotic key party, this is a study in self-absorbed East Coast elitism and liberalism gone wrong. I know because I am from the East Coast and saw all of this first-hand.

936770,5,6304844964,"The Ice Storm is easily among the most dead-on and tragic family dramas ever made. Very much in the same vein as American Beauty, The Squid and the Whale, Happiness, and Ordinary People, The Ice Storm examines the dark underbelly of suburban life. It follows people so bored with their lives that they knowingly succumb to dangerous behavior that could only spell trouble. Having witnessed this strange phenomenon firsthand, The Ice Storm is shockingly realistic and bleak. Usually, films that take place in the 1970s take full advantage of all of the decade's more fun and outrageous qualities (Dazed and Confused), but this film is totally unsentimental and uses its backdrop of a Watergate-shaken America as more of symbolic precursor to the unrest that inhabits the world the characters live in. The actual ice storm is a clever metaphor for the destructive nature of the characters lives and events only seem to get worse when they venture outside the comfort of their homes and into the storm. Instead of some quirky, self-indulgent director (Wes Anderson, Noah Baumbach, Todd Solondz) taking on this kind of material that would seem suited for them, Ang Lee, someone who is maybe not as obviously 'right' for the story, completely knocks it out of the park. His shots are perfectly framed, his style is not intrusive (excellent choice for the story), he gets the tone spot-on, and his production design team is brilliant. Disillusionment is a pretty strong theme and something that all of the characters have in common, so the performances are pretty subtle and reserved in their emotional displays. Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, and Sigourney Weaver are all amazing and Christina Ricci, Tobey Maguire, Elijah Wood, Adam Hann-Byrd, and Katie Holmes manage to outshine the stellar adult cast with performances that prove there are child actors who can handle and even sometimes dominate serious roles in serious films. The score is certainly an oddity, consisting of what sounds like new age meditation music. Thankfully, it fits the quiet tone of the movie very well. Everything taken into consideration, The Ice Storm is one of the most criminally overlooked movies ever. As far as serious, smart, and bold family dramas go, it doesn't get much better than this.",1402358400,11,2265,5.0588235294117645

936892,5,6304844964,"The late `90s were a time of reflection for middle age Americans. Movies like the Oscar-winning ""American Beauty"" surveyed the suburban malaise that enshrouded the culture arong the same time that President Bill Clinton went through his trials with Monica Lewinsky.

One film that turned its attention to the past in order to draw a parallel to the present was Ang Lee's hypnotic THE ICE STORM (***, 1997, 113 mins., R; Criterion), which arrives on Blu-Ray this month courtesy of Criterion.

A marvelously written and multi-layered film that's now as noteworthy for the presence of its young cast (Tobey Maguire, Christina Ricci, Elijah Wood, Katie Holmes) as it is for its veteran stars (Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Jamey Sheridan), ""The Ice Storm"" was based on Rick Moody's novel about wealthy New Canaan, Connecticut socialites who opt -- with tragic consequences -- into clandestine relationships with one another, all the while neglecting their misguided children, who are fast getting into trouble of their own.

Set against the beginnings of the Watergate scandal, ""The Ice Storm"" was shot in authentic New England locales and boasts a natural, haunting feel courtesy of director Lee and cinematographer Frederick Elmes. Composer Mychael Danna's unconventional score incorporates Native American instrumentation, accentuating the natural setting of the story's surroundings while enhancing its protagonists' disillusionment and the downside of the `70s sexual revolution. This is a movie that examines cultural and societal change and the negative consequences of its era's mores, yet does so in such a compelling filmmaking manner that it's impossible not to get lost in the picture's subtle and melancholy atmosphere. I've always found it to be a far more interesting and satisfying piece than Sam Mendes' more overtly in-your-face ""American Beauty,"" and rightly regarded on Criterion's jacket as one of the finest films of the 1990s.

Criterion's Blu-Ray includes a 2K digital transfer (1080p) with 2.0 DTS MA audio. Extras, carried over from the label's prior two-disc DVD set, include Lee and screenwriter James Schamus' commentary, while interviews with Allen, Kline, Maguire, Ricci, Weaver and Wood are on-hand along with a video interview with author Moody. Visual essays on the film (featuring additional interviews with crew members), footage from a New York Museum of the Moving Image gathering with Lee and Schamus, and deleted scenes make for a marvelous release all around.",1375228800,,2509,5.425641025641026

936898,1,6304844964,"The movie industry seems to think if you throw together a big-name director (Ang Lee, in this case), big-name actors (Kevin Kline, Tobey Maguire, Christina Ricci), and a depressing, glacial-paced, butt-numbing zzz-inducing script designed to show how dysfunctional suburban families are, and (last but not least) throw in lots of sex, that is ART.  I managed to sit through to the end of this pretentious tripe, but it wasn't easy (caffeine helped).  I'm guessing that people who rate this highly are the same people who went into raptures over American Beauty, people who feel good about feeling bad, people who hate their own parents and have convinced themselves that the hook-up culture in Manhattan or Seattle or Frisco is infinitely better than any home that includes two married people (man + woman, that is) and their biological children.  I mean, the artsy types just KNOW those intact families are breeding grounds for neurosis.  (I believe the technical term for this is ""sour grapes,"" and also ""wishful thinking."")

Normally I don't do spoilers, but I will in this case, since I hope no sane reader will watch this detestable time-waster anyway.  The high point is a character getting electrocuted.  Well, move over William Shakespeare and George Bernard Shaw, you have some serious competition.  There is more humanity and depth in one page of Shakespeare than in the entire script of this monstrosity.  The script is by the same hack who wrote the script for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, which at least was visually interesting and even exciting during the fight scenes. Creating three-dimension human characters does not seem to be his strong suit.

Save yourself some money: if you enjoy watching people be mean and miserable, watch re-runs of Jerry Springer. You'll at least get a few laughs, and you won't have to pretend that what you're watching is High Art.  On the other hand, if you're single and miserable, and want to convince yourself that being married with children and living in the suburbs is a hell on earth, you will LOVE The Ice Storm.  Watching it back to back with American Beauty would be the perfect preparation for hitting the bars on Saturday night.",1342224000,14,2191,4.972602739726027

Both adults and adolescent kids experiment with dangerous activities such as wife swapping and drug abuse.

In one scene this teenage girl nearly drops dead from the affects of sleeping pills so the kid just throws her on the floor.  In reality they should have called 911.

I thought this movie had some potential and might explore some of those issues in depth and in interesting ways.  Rather it is just a creepy movie about people searching for happiness in the wrong places.

People need something to believe in in this world in order to be happy.  They won't find happiness in extra marital affairs, alcohol, socializing, etc..

However, I could not find one character that I really cared for. for me, this movie was somewhat like Revolutionary Road, which was just too shallow. Elena (Joan Allen) was hard to feel anything for. The only time I did feel something for her was when she rode the bike to the drugstore and stole the merchandise.  It was definitely a plea of some sort, but then it sort of just stopped right there.

936958,5,6304844964,"A lot of people I know compare this film to `American Beauty', and I totally understand why.  Both films explore suburban family life in a way that is honest and flawed and completely exploitive without ever appearing overdone or, well, exploitive.  I completely adore both films, but while `American Beauty' excels in really capturing the insecurities and eventual demise of the middle-aged man, `The Ice Storm' takes a different route (albeit similar circumstances) in that it exposes the moral breakdown of the average family.

Both films involve a family unit, complete with children, and both films expose a marriage on the rocks (complete with an affair) as well as childish rebellion and self discovery on both sides of the spectrum, but to be `The Ice Storm' works a little more in that it actually feels invested in every character.

Outside of Spacey, `American Beauty' loses some footing.

Ben and Elena Hood are seemingly happy parents with a daughter at home and a son off in school, but when their son Paul comes home for a visit they begin to visibly unravel.  Both Paul and his sister Wendy are beginning to explore their own individuality, which as per usual involves some sort of distorted intimacy, and this coincides with their parents beginning to acknowledge their own inadequacies.  Ben has been fooling around with Janey Carver, the mother of Mikey, Wendy's current flame.  Elena is most likely privy to the affair, even if she refuses to admit it to herself, but what is even more pertinent is that the children here all know and understand far more than the parents want to believe.

What is so beautiful (tragically so) about `The Ice Storm' is that it exposes the messes we parents make while we falsely believe that our children are too young to understand all that they are witnessing.

Sigourney Weaver's character Janey is the perfect example of this very idea.

Across the board the film is filled with stellar performances that really ignite on contact.  Kevin Kline has rarely been better (and when you consider that he also starred in the uproarious `In & Out' this same year you really have to hand it to him) and Joan Allen is all sorts of stellar as Elena, giving her a true sense of uninformed (or should I say unacknowledged) dread.  Tobey Maguire, Adam Hann-Byrd, Christina Ricci (OMG amazing here), Elijah Wood and Katie Holmes all astound in their roles (some great child acting here); but it is one name that resounds loudest and that is Sigourney Weaver.  Her understanding of the unaccepted flaws of Janey is just marvelous.  That final scene, after the party, alone in the house and then suddenly aware of the truth; it's just a heart-stopper.

In the end I must say that `The Ice Storm' is one of the most sublimely done films on family tension I've ever seen, exposing the heart of human frailty without coming across as preachy, contrived or clichd.  It is honest, dark and surprisingly inspired, and the final moments (where eyes are opened for the very first time) add a layer of hope that is much needed in the world we live in today.

I think all of the acting is excellent, and that it perfectly portrays the suburban ennui of Connecticut in the 1970s that, albeit in a different form, still exists to this day. My complaint is this: I searched for ""weather in New Canaan, Connecticut, November 23, 1973"" in Wolfram Alpha recently (November 23 being the date of the titular ice storm) and the result I got was -- are you ready for this? -- ""temperature average: 48F, conditions: fog, overcast, cloudy, partly cloudy, few clouds, clear."" That, my friends, is a far cry from an ice storm.

I kept thinking I'd seen the film before---it reminded me a lot of Revolutionary Road, another look at morally bankrupt suburban Connecticut families...even to the point of the hasty, clumsy sex in the car between the two neighbors.  That was directed by Sam Mendes, another good director from another culture.  One wonders what fascination this bit of Americana holds for these foreigners...Are they so eager to see the dark side of our culture?

The first time I saw a film about the underside of the affluent white suburbs was back in the 60's I think, with Robert Redford's brilliant film, Ordinary People, starring Mary Tyler Moore and I think Timothy Hutton.  That was a real breakthrough in showing how things weren't as pretty as they seemed on the surface.  But gee, that was a long time ago...and I think we've all gotten the message.  I don't know when the novel from which the book was taken was written...perhaps it had relevance at that time.  But to me, this is just rehashing the same old ideas and I don't see that Lee adds anything to our understanding about the scene at all. Lot of stupid sex among the adults and the kids, lots of alcohol and drugs and talk about the meaninglessness of life, or whatever was in that comic book that Toby McGuire kept reading.  Boring, pretentious stuff.

936962,5,6304844964,"The old cleche the book is better than the film is usually true. A writer can convey an idea in a word, page or chapter. A film maker, somtimes, only has a shot.

But  not ture for Ice Storm. I both read and viewed. The elaborations in Moody's book are on political events, decorating styles, and small details of the early 70s. Toe socks. Metal ice trays.

Director Ang Lee works these into each shot of his 1997 film, about two, next door familes, Thanksgiving weekend, 1973. Coouples are having affairs and testing group sex. Everything held true was false. They were lied to about Vietnam and were embroiled in Watergate. The country they knew, gone. Their early teen kids are expermenting with sex and drugs.

In the book, Ben Hood, the father, spanks his kid with a hairbrush. Is unrepentant about his afairs.  There is viscousness. In the movie, Kevin Klien's Ben is flawed too--but is gentle, uncertian, ashamed of his indiscretions, trying but failing to find his way home. Klien is too likeable and cerebral an actor to play Hood as a cad.

The same goes for Hood's wife, Elaina. When, in the book, she catches her daugter Wendy in bed with the neighbors kid, she first tries to spank her and pulls hair when the kid resists. On screen, Joan Allen gives a befuddlled look, tells Wendy to dress, and shuts the door. She does not know what to do. But at least she  thinks before acting.

Book to film, the premice changes. Rick Moody is more interested in hypocrocy and cruelity, how families destory each other. Lee sees the damage a result of uncertianty, secrets, people unable to deal effectively with their own emptiness.

I perfer the film. The characters are complex, and you can empathize with them more. You may not like what they do, but you can see something in them basically decent.

Lee's directing is full of nuance, pockets of silence, and subtext. It unfolds slow as a New Haven Winter day. If you are going to make a film about 1973, why not use 1973 pacing and subtlety.

If more 2009 films were made like this, paying twelve bucks for a movie would be a lot easier to swollow.",1249603200,7,2104,4.554376657824934

Men and women in their 30s+ were breaking free from the chains of outmoded morality and social inhibitions. There was only one problem. While our parents were busy shacking up, smoking pot, and passing out, we kids were left to our own devices. We roamed the streets and did all the experimenting we could think up, including some things that would make our parents sober up fast! Yep, I remember the 70s. THE ICE STORM is a very accurate recreation that brings a smile and a tear. I knew kids like Christina Ricci's character, I loved blowing stuff up w/ M-80s myself, and we all seemed to have parents who were so dedicated to ""finding themselves"" or just avoiding boredom, that they forgot to raise their children.

Kevin Kline, Joan Allen and Sigourney Weaver are the key adults in this film, which highlights one holiday season in a Connecticut community -- with the festive dinners and holiday parties -- and reveals the superficial lifestyle of those who are bored by the surfeit of material possessions and the absence of meaning in their lives.

Even though the film was made in the late nineties, the production seemingly transplanted the viewer completely into that time.  Like a flashback -- or time warp -- we can glimpse the lives of those disenchanted characters and really feel their malaise.

The youngsters are portrayed by Tobey Maguire and Christina Ricci, among others, and while they, too, are delving into sexual pursuits, they also  seem to be going through the motions.

In the story, we see how a dangerous ice storm, which happens on the same night as an adult key party and while the young folks are left to their own devices, renders havoc for everyone concerned.

I had seen this movie a few times when it first came out, but when I watched it again this week, I felt ""chilled"" to the bone.

This adult drama is full of outstanding performances:  Kevin Kline and a luminously lovely Joan Allen play husband and wife who are both filled with pain and longing.  Sigourney Weaver is great as the self-absorbed and callous neighbor wife who hooks up with Kline's character.  The kids include a young, sensitive Tobey Maguire who lusts after classmate Katie Holmes, while younger siblings Christina Ricci and Elijah Woods suffer the pangs of adolescence.  It's played very low-key with no sentimentality to show what self-indulgent and disconnected lives they lead.

The Watergate scandal is reaching its height, and the country is experiencing its own breakdown via open marriages, teen sexual experimentation and drugs. As the weather gets colder, the action among the characters heats up near to the boiling point.

Elena Hood (Joan Allen) is shoplifting cosmetics in the local pharmacy while her husband Ben (Kevin Kline) is having an affair with Janey Carver (Sigourney Weaver). Poor Ben, in some ways, all he may need to do is have someone to talk to, but when he opens up afterward to Janey, she says:

""Ben, you're boring me. I have a husband. I don't have a need for another one.""

Despite his own philanderings, Ben can barely talk to his sixteen year old son Paul about self abuse. ""If you have any questions, we can look it up."" Or, his daughter Wendy (Ricci) about making out with the boy next door.

""Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep,"" Rev. Phillips (Michael Cumpsty) answers Elena when she encounters him at a key party.

This film is much more than just a tell-all sexy account of a bygone era. ""The Ice Storm"" is not that kind of an easy watch.  It's a bitter coming of age tale for both generations.

937098,5,6304844964,"Ang Lee's ""The Ice Storm"" is a brilliant, beautiful, but haunting film, that shows us how the sexual revolution of the 1960's brought about emotional devestation, once it hit the suburbs of the 1970's. This is a portrait of two upper middle class families, who are trying to find themselves in the decade of Watergate and Vietnam, where sex, drugs and infidelity are among the many obstacles to confront them. We are shown adults, who act like adolescents and adolescents, who are too quickly trying to become adults.

Ang Lee does an excellent job of recreating the era through architecture, music, wardrobe etc. But where he really triumphs is in creating an emotional framework, which makes us care about these people. All the actors involved with this movie give near perfect performances. Special mention should be made for actors, Kevin Kline and Joan Allen, who show us a married couple, who's relationship is in a downward spiral. Finally, kudos should go out to Composer, Mychael Danna, who provides the film with a beautiful, moody and meditative score, that stays with you long after the movie is over.

When ""The Ice Storm"" had it's original theatrical run in 1997, it came and went without much notice. The studio had totally bungled the film's marketing and release date. I personally loved this movie and was really shocked, when it did not receive even a single Academy Award nomination that year.

Now, over a decade later this wonderful film is finally getting the recognition it deserves from a small, but growing cult audience. This is no more evident, then the film's recent re-release to DVD by 'The Criterion Collection'. This rectifies the original 2001 release, which was pretty skimpy in the 'extras' department.'The Criterion Collection' (as usual) has done a marvelous job in supplying a multitude of extras. This includes an entertaining and inciteful commentary track from Director, Ang Lee and Screenwriter, James Schamus. They discuss both the film's production and it's themes. The two are also featured in a filmed 'Q&A' event at New York's 'Museum of the Moving Image'. Other extras include deleted scenes (with commentary) and a documentary featuring most of the film's cast. Also quite interesting is a series of mini-docs, which concentrate on the look of 'The Ice Storm' including cinematography, costumes and sets.

937100,3,6304844964,"My mistake in 1997 was to see this film the day after I finished the book.  Expectations were set far too high and I was disappointed with all the changes.  Therefore, I knew that a space of over a decade would be good enough to view this solely as a film, and I still find it lacking.  The first forty-five minutes (which are original and not from the book) are the weakest part of the movie.  The dialogue is weak- the whole ""your body is a temple"" speech - attempts to make Joan Allen's mother more human came across as pointless and Kevin Kline's acting is too broad for me.  There just doesn't seem to be any soul or heart to the story.

But there are good things about the film.  The clothes, hair and decor are spot on.  We get to see early performances from Tobey Maguire, Katie Holmes and David Krumholtz.  Cristina Ricci - going from child actress to adult - is undergoing her awkward phase in this movie, and it fits the character.  Allison Janney who livens up the proceedings with her smoky eye-makeup, semi-deranged performance and key party.

Speaking of the key party, the film picks up when the title storm hits and the family is scattered.  The party scene is very well-directed and is the high point of the movie. I could watch it over and over for the clothes alone. But in the end, I felt just as disappointed in this second viewing as I did originally.  Fans of the film, take heart.

But Ang Lee gave us some glimpses into the landscape of 1970s suburbia, in the wake of the sexual revolution. ""The Ice Storm"" is a chilly, bitterly lonely little drama, with moments of biting humour and poignant alienation between these people. They pass each other, but never touch.

The Carvers and Hood live in the same affluent suburban neighborhood, and on the surface all seems well. But self-absorbed Ben Hood (Kevin Kline) is having an affair with the icy Janie Carver (Sigourney Weaver), and his daughter Wendy (Christina Ricci) is experimenting with Janey's son Mikey (Elijah Wood. And Elena Hood (Joan Allen) is experiencing an identity crisis as a woman.

Things start crumbling over Thanksgiving weekend, when Ben finds Wendy and Mikey in a compromising position (which involves a Nixon mask), and Elena figures out the truth about her husband's affair. As an ice storm sweeps over New Canaan, the parents set out to a ""key party,"" all their relationships will reach boiling point -- and a tragedy will strike.

The neighborhood of ""The Ice Storm"" is not one you'd want to live in -- people talk but rarely speak, have sex but no intimacy, and can't communicate with their own children and spouses. So it's a credit to Ang Lee's directorial skill that he can actually draw you into this story.

And Lee does a really brilliant job of not only illustrating these intertwined, painfully distant relationships, but tying them into the 1970s world. It's like a bunch of beautifully filmed moments strung together -- the kiss in the swimming pool, wintry trysts, biking through the woods, and the awkward Thanksgiving dinner where Wendy goes into a political rant ""prayer"" at grace.

Lee seems a bit overfond of ice metaphors and dead leaves, to the point of close-ups of ice-cube trays. Really, enough. But his direction is pitch-perfect -- he paints a delicate, lonely, chilly beauty into every corner of the movie. This is especially true in the second half, when we see the spacey Mikey sliding and running in an icy wonderland.

Though it's rather bleak, there are plenty of darkly humorous moments (""Mikey have you heard the explosions coming from the back yard?"" ""I dunno""). But as the story winds on, dialogue becomes much less important -- there are long silences that tell us much more than words. Sorrow, resentment, pain, anger and indifference are all hinted at without a word.

And the acting is practically perfect all around. Tobey Maguire serves an important function -- he is the ""normal"" one, an ordinary boy who is hoping to score with a girl. Christina Ricci is excellent as a political nymphet. And Elijah Wood is glorious as Mikey, an endearingly ethereal boy who is obsessed with molecules and squares.

As for the adults, Kevin Kline is amazing as the detached Ben, who discovers the hard way what his selfishness has caused. Weaver and Allen are similarly great as two icy women with warm feelings swimming deep inside, but very different ways of dealing with their unhappy marriages.

The world of ""Ice Storm"" is a cold, barren one, and I'm not just talking about the late-autumn weather. But Ang Lee gives it a cold, poignant brilliance.",1206921600,4,3270,4.854578096947935

So if you are up for that, this is an extraodinarily good, memorable film.  It has really only one flaw -- it becomes message-heavy near the end.  It didn't have to push the message that hard to accomplish its goal.  Its a minor flaw and the movie succeeds in virtually every other way.",1206403200,4,585,4.533333333333333

After many uncomfortable moments sitting there with my father, the film wrapped up with its tragic finale. I was speechless to say the least. Now, 10 years later, I still am.

'The Ice Storm' is truely one of the most incredibly underappreciated films of the 90s. I think that had it been made today (especially now with Ang Lee being a more familiar name thanks in part to 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and 'Brokeback Mountain'), the film would have made a lot more noise that it did back in '97. But for some reason, the people of 1997 just weren't ready for what 'The Ice Storm' had in store. If only it had waited two more years, it would have brilliantly accompained 'American Beauty'. The two are strangely very similar yet different. Both are excellent films, though I feel 'The Ice Storm' is far more mature and composed.

The film is about two families who interact with each other in many ways. The parents are cheating on each other. Their children are experimenting with each other via sex and drugs. Yet, before you say that it sounds pretty drab or even bleak, let me just say that there's so much more. The writing and direction is so sharp and observant. The acting is flawless and fearless. It's not only one of the best films of the 90s, it's one of my favorite films of all time.

Fans of family dynamics and infedelity will greatly enjoy. There's also enough social commentary to keep even the peskiest viewer interested. Bottom line: 'The Ice Storm' is a brilliant film that's not afraid to ""go there"". Its acceptance into the Criterion Collection is a wonderful aknowledgement of its importance. It truely does stand the test of time.",1205539200,5,1833,4.515060240963855

He has successfully dabbled in several genres and with The Ice Storm, he adapted Rick Moody's 1994 novel of the same name, a drama set in 1973 during the waning years of the sexual revolution.

The Ice Storm feels like an Ingmar Bergman or John Cassavetes film from the 1970s with a dash of Atom Egoyan (the look of either Exotica or The Sweet Hereafter). It also has a textured, painterly quality thanks to the exquisite cinematography of Frederick Elmes who also shot some of David Lynch's best films (Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, and Wild at Heart). He really captures the tacky, kitschy look of the `70s and is helped considerably by the attention to period detail (awful sweater vests over turtleneck sweaters) and the top notch production design (capturing the look of the houses from that era).

The Ice Storm takes a fascinating look at a specific time and place through the eyes of an outsider - the Taiwanese-born Lee who offers a fresh perspective on American culture. His film can be seen as a melancholic lament for the end of an era and the loss of innocence that began with the Kennedy assassination. Kudos to the Criterion Collection for giving this unfairly neglected film their deluxe treatment.

The first disc features an audio commentary by director Ang Lee and producer/screenwriter James Schamus. They banter back and forth like the long-time friends and collaborators that they are. Lee makes some astute observations about the characters and points out his favourite shots and lines of dialogue in the film. This is an entertaining and informative commentary.

There is also a theatrical trailer.

The second disc starts off with ""Weathering the Storm,"" a 36-minute retrospective featurette with new interviews with a lot of the key cast members who reflect on making the film and how it affected their careers.  Everyone talks about what it was like to work with Lee. This is an excellent look at how the film came together by some of the actors who were in it.

""Rick Moody Interview"" features the author of the source novel talking about his feelings towards the film adaptation. These characters were an intimate part of him and the film version was a very different take on them.

""Lee and Schamus at MOMI."" The two talk about their filmmaking career together at the Museum of the Moving Image in November 2007. They talk about how various films came together and reflect on them in an eloquent and intelligent way.

""The Look of The Ice Storm"" features interviews with cinematographer Frederick Elmes, production designer Mark Friedberg, and costume designer Carol Oditz. They talk about how they helped realize Lee's vision.

Also included are four deleted scenes with optional commentary by Schamus. We see Ben at work in a funny bit with Kline and Henry Czerny. He talks about why these scenes were cut.",1205452800,39,3786,5.968634686346864
937105,3,6304844964,"Look, I think Ang Lee is a fine director, but this film misses the mark despite aiming for the right target.

Lee effectively uses a melancholy, wintry backdrop -- along with the Watergate scandal -- in his attempt to convey the post-60s disillusionment that existed in the bleak and almost-cozily forlorn early-70s... I can almost see Mary Richards driving thru the snow with songs by BREAD going ""bwwwwooonggggg--- bwwwwonnggggg....""

Almost.

Unfortunately, the wonderful opportunity to capture this now-so-distant era wound up being reduced to a cliche`d cartoon. The acting mostly isn't very good (even from good actors) and the dialogue seems forced and trite in its efforts to feel ""to period"".

Sure, THE ICE STORM is considerably better having been shot in the '90s than it would have been had it been filmed in, say, the self-conscious '80s when any period picture felt illegitimate (such movies tended to be much more sincere in the '90s), but the overall texture of the thing is off. It all feels more than a little pretentious.... It's not the subject-matter; it's the execution.

Ang Lee clearly had the right idea in mind with this movie, and the physicality of it is near-perfect. But the effect is undermined by what feels like too desperate an effort to be ""meaningful"", rendering the ""My God, what have we done to our children??"" type finale more silly--- and ultimately ringing hollow--- than anything else.

937176,5,6304844964,"1973 was a turbulent year. President Richard Nixon was watching his administration dissolve into scandal and the culture of the time saw marriages breaking up more rapidly,free love expanding from the hippies to the suburbs,people were reading all of the numerous ""self-help"" books flooding the market,drugs were becoming middle and upper class norms,children were ""latch-key"" kids,everyone went to an ""analyst"" and every taboo was being broken. What the '60's started, the '70's completed. THIS IS THE MATERIAL of Ang Lee's ""The Ice Storm"" presented so finely tuned and so expertly executed that calling it a ""subtle,tense nail-biter"" is the only way that I can choose to describe this film.

Let me say this right now: this film IS NOT going to appeal or be understood by lots of viewers so I really cannot see why anyone would waste the time arguing about the film. I was 18 years old when this film takes place, and so for me it was a study in the time frame that shaped my late high school and early college days. That I know for a fact that my family experienced all of these chilling events that Ang Lee presents, chilled my 50 something soul down to and through the marrow of my bones.
If you recently saw ACROSS THE UNIVERSE in the theatre, then THE ICE STORM is what resulted from the Era that THAT film chronicled.

Two families are scrutinized in this 1970's study;actors Joan Allen and Kevin Kline with their children played by Christina Ricci and Tobey Maguire; and the other parents,Sigourney Weaver and Jamey Sheriden and their offspring Elijah Wood and Adam Hann-Byrd. Lee stalks these two families,their inner turmoils and inter-relations and brings all of these dysfunctionalities,(as it were mentioned above) to an ""infected head""  during a freak ice storm where one of them dies. That's all I am saying. This film is a master look at the Era and its well developed characters. You may like NONE of these characters,because we are not certain that they even like themselves. Nothing is left untouched or underdeveloped. Nothing that is exposed is covered up. MAN...WHAT A FILM! Only Ang Lee (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN,SENSE AND SENSIBILITY and the current LUST CAUTION) could pull this one off.

It stuck me as terribly sad. Perhaps our way of life in Western civilization brings about evil. Too comfortable for our own good. Even in the poor parts of our country, we have it good compared to just a couple of hundred years ago. Yet human nature has this inbred part of us that says ""more"".

""This film is based on Rick Moody's novel about Thanksgiving 1973 in a middle-class New England family, with adolescent children fumbling with puberty while their parents flounder in the backwash of the sexual revolution. Though expertly made and well acted, the film's characters are uptight and repellent, and the story is bleak and oversymbolic. More to be admired than enjoyed.""

I read this ""review"" before seeing the movie and after watching it I can't help but think to myself...What was that guy smoking? ""The Ice Storm"" is directed by Oscar winning director Ang Lee (Best Director, 'Brokeback Mountain') and is just as good, if not better, than the movie he took home his Oscar for. This movie is no less than a masterpiece; It's got amazing performances, it has a very ""American Beauty"" feel to it. To say this film is more to be admired than enjoyed is idiotic. The movie stars Kevin Kline as Ben Hood, the father of a family all dealing with their own set of problems.

Son Paul Hood (Tobey Maguire) has fallen in love with a beautiful girl named Libbets Casey (Katie Holmes), whom his friend (David Krumholtz, TV's ""Numbers"") has already started to move in on. Daughter Wendy (Christina Ricci) is a girl smack dab in the middle of that pubescent age where nothing is really off limits. His wife Elena (Joan Allen) is quiet and reserved longing for something more than she's getting in her marriage, which is mostly because Ben himself is having an affair with his neighbor Janey (Sigourney Weaver) who has also grown bored with Ben. In the course of one night, during a freak ice storm, all their lives will change forever. For some reason, two movies came to mind while watching this. American Beauty and Me & You & Everyone We Know. All three films have a strange quirkiness to them, but also manage to have the same dramatic impact. If you liked those two films, you should like this. This is a very entertaining film, very well made film that is one of Ang Lee's finest hours.

937180,3,6304844964,"The Ice Storm might make a good sentimental date flick, a tear jerker that could put the average guy in good standing with his lady, as it creates a nice facade of sensitivity with the added bonus of placing the manly-man in great position to comfort his weeping woman, but as a work of cinematic art, which is what it pretentiously tries to be, it has some very major flaws.

The number one thing that a film maker has to avoid in dramatic cinema is causing a laugh riot at an inappropriate time, and most especially if that moment just happens to be the most critical scene in the whole movie, unfortunately, Ang Lee placed an image on the screen that would of worked far better in a South Park episode then as the peak moment of sadness in a tragic drama.

To explain; As the film neared this critical zenith of sadness, the adults in the story were all involved in a key party, a swingers game in which all the men place their car keys in a punch bowl as the wemen line up and one by one fish out a set of keys without looking, they then have to go home with the random owner of the keys they drew from the bowl. Meanwhile, Elijah Wood, who is playing the dejected teenage son of one of the sinful parents, is outside in the dark night playing in an ice storm. First he stupidly risks his neck by jumping up and down on a super slick ice incrusted diving board over the deep end of an empty swiming pool. Like many dumbed down highly manimpulated moralistic tales, Elijah Wood's tempting of fate and surviving is mearly the forshadowing, and prolonging of the unavoidable, his immanent death is around the corner, it is being milked all too odviously to increase the dramatic tension, and impose further sadness apon the audience.

Next he is seen sliding on his rump down the black ice of a curvy road, an image that already threatens to give a dark soul like mine an uncontrollable case of the giggles. He then stops to stare in awe at a crackling storm damaged electricle wire, while sitting on the metal guard rail of this frozen empty curve, only to watch as the wire snaps, and angrily slithers across the icy street to zap the metal guard rail with the necessary voltage to end his bodily functions.

It is bad enough to try to subject a particular emotion on an audience with such blatant plot devices, and absurdly ridiculous turn of events, but to top it off with an image of a face down body cloaked in a little red hoody, as it inces its way down an icy road is simply too much to take.

When I saw this movie in the theatre back in 1997, this image in conjunction with the overtly manipulated, force fed tone of pathos, caused me to double over in my seat with explosive laughter, so much so, that till this day, I am extremely greatful that I wasn't drinking anything, or holding any sharp objects in my hands at the time. When the film ended I became acutely aware of the fellow exiting movie patrons mean mugging me on the way out. The person I shared this cinematic experience with took full advantage of my captivated audience by loudly asking me what I had learned from the Ice Storm.

""Well what I've learned,"" I loudly replied."" is that I better not get any wild ideas about sexing up my neighbors wife, because God will become angry and kill my first born male child, and since I don't have any children, he will be forced to kill my poor dog and send him sliding down the road in his little red parka.""

In conclusion, I gave this movie 3 stars because it is very visually appealing, and has the best ""I'll show you mine, if you show me yours."" scene ever put on film between Christina Ricci and a chubby boy, but outside of that I can only recommend renting this film, as it is too flawed in its story telling, and far too moralistic to warrant ownership.",1145232000,7,3783,4.342291371994342
937181,5,6304844964,"Really, it is. It may be too dark and too slow for some. It is not a happy film, and it may depress you terribly. It did depress me.

This is a film about alienation, and it is devastatingly accurate. If you dare watch it, take note of all the conversations. In nearly every scene one character tries to reach out to another character, to try to tell them something intimate or important. In every scene except one they are brushed aside or ignored. The only scene where two characters connect and actually communicate, they talk in code, not directly.

Yes it is beautifully shot and acted. It may well accurately evoke America of the 70s, I wouldn't know I wasn't there. A lot of people are doing squalid, illegal or kinky things in the movie. But to focus on these things alone seems to me to miss the real point of the film. I think it is alienation that drives the aberrant behaviour of these people, not the place or the period.

I don't think the film is meant to depict the failings of any period. I don't think there is any judgement or solution offered. It is simply a stark portrayal of alienation.

I haven't read the book, I would like to. Perhaps others who suggest the setting is more important than I do have their perceptions coloured by having read it. Before reading it I will go out on a limb and suggest the storyline and the setting are just a vehicle for this depiction of alienation.

This film is a disturbing masterpiece which may make you reconsider your own life relationships.",1143936000,5,1505,4.458181818181818
937182,5,6304844964,"It's ironic that the warmest and most humane of movie directors, Ang Lee (""Sense and Sensibility,"" ""Brokeback Mountain"") is the director of the icy-cold (weather, of course and tone) and surgically precise ""The Ice Storm.""

Lee's innate humanity makes itself known in his handling of the characters here: he never judges, he never points a finger...he shows, he doesn't tell. It is a slippery slope though as the Rick Moody source material veers towards condemnation of this particularly randy and supposedly ""swinging"" group of mid 1970's couples and their children.

The wasp adults: a cold, cold, man-eating Sigourney Weaver as Janey Carver, a very sad but trying to be hip and lacking the wherewithal to pull it off, Joan Allen as Elena Hood and a ""not-there"" Jamey Sheridan and pseudo-hip but really just horny Kevin Kline as their respective husbands Jim Carver and Ben Hood...form the odd quartet of 30 somethings, probably used-to-be 60's hippies either in deed but most likely just in thought. Both couples have two children: also in various stages of rebellion and angst.

The signature scene in ""The Ice Storm"" is the Key Party: a ritual party in which the husbands put their keys in a bowl and at the party's close, the women pick a set of keys thereby choosing the man with whom they will have sex that night.

Lee's camera swoops and swirls around all the guests as we catch snippets of conversations: affairs are concluded, gossip is exchanged, discrete and not so discrete flirting happens, much liquor is consumed and gallons of white lipstick is applied...Lee let's us in on all of it. And he does it without rancor, without an agenda and always with his patented warmth and love.

Arguably the best film of 1997 (""The Sweet Hereafter"" is it's equal that year also), ""The Ice Storm"" is ultimately a tragedy of Classical Greek proportions: the world of this film is icy cold as are many of its inhabitants but Ang Lee's blazing humanity warms and soothes revealing an open wound of despair, indecision and loneliness.",1140307200,10,2034,4.884057971014493
937183,4,6304844964,"The Ice Storm is a startling look at 1973 America and how lost so many people (parents, children, neighbors, etc.) became during this transitional time. The free-love of the 60s spill over into the 30 and 40-somethings of a sleepy Connecticut community and runs smack into the dysfunctional family of Ben and Elena Hood (Kevin Kline and Joan Allen).

Ben is having an affair with his neighbors wife, Janey Carver (Sigourney Weaver, ALIENS), and the boredom they both feel during their ""love making"" is palpable. They want something different to happen, but what that ""something"" is remains unobtainable. And the two's lackadaisical attitudes toward sex, family, and the times seep into their everyday lives; even into their spouses' and children.

Ben's wife Elena gets caught shoplifting from the local pharmacy. Janey's husband Jim goes away on long business trips and returns with funks of depression because of what he witnesses going on in his family.

The children of Ben and Janey are also settling into this bizarre behavior. Some of them explore sexuality in often strange ways, or run out into storms and play on ice-covered roads. Others blow things up with M80 firecrackers, or smoke pot and drink to numb themselves out.

But all of these people's lives will change in an unalterable way during one evening; an ice storm has hit and the cold outside bashes against the cold each character feels inside. Some will live, some will die, and others will never be the same.

______________________________________________________________________________

The attention to detail on the 70s in director Ang Lee's movie is astounding. The sweater-vest outfits, paneled station wagons, and boxy homes were excellently filmed.

You can also feel the dark undercurrent running through the characters' lives: the grayish landscape cinematography against the quiet homes that harbor secrets.

The cast was absolutely perfect, too. Kevin Kline (one of my favorite actors), Sigourney Weaver, Joan Allen, Elijah Wood, Tobey Maguire, Katie Holmes, Christina Ricci, and Jamey Sheridan all pull in stunning performances.

Having gushed over how well done the movie was, I do have to comment on its pacing. If you thought SIDEWAYS was snail-like, this movie may make you feel as though grass could grow faster.

Director Ang Lee has had some serious success in Hollywood as of late (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005), but this earlier work is an excellent way to see how he's grown in the intervening years.",1139011200,5,2493,5.225563909774436

Taking place over Thanksgiving weekend 1973 in New Canaan, CT--the town's biblical name is no accident in this tale of a genteel suburban Sodom--sex and substance abuse are the means by which two affluent families try to fill the moral void created by Nixon, free love, and TV. The kids act like adults and the adults act like kids, with neither group finding satisfaction. It is by turns laugh-out-loud funny (a junior high oral report on molecules) and squirm-in-your-seat uncomfortable (men and women face off across a glass coffee table at a key party) with a redemptive ending which through death and tears brings a modicum of meaning back into these otherwise empty lives.",1138406400,,845,4.834482758620689

But with Ang's recent, brilliant, Brokeback Mountain, I upped this and several of his other pictures to the top of my must see list.  For whatever reason my expectations had made this movie more about a storm (literally)and more like a typical MI:2 action film.  Instead, its far more like Brokeback, a simple movie about characters and people dealing with their problems.

Thats I believe where the similarities end though.  None of the performances stuck out at me, with the exception of Joan Allen at times.  There is a really nice moment with her and Kline in their  kitchen after dinner.  The story just never really involved me all that much either.  I liked all of Maguires situation and really felt his pain, but in the end never got anything out of what transpired.  Perhaps all the built up sexual frustration and exploration throughout the film just doesnt resonate with me?

The story is all so wrong and disturbing, it's simply amazing. If you want to see the film portraying people's vices, showing the very worst and disgusting in people, stupid families, wrong relationships and meaningless deeds - then you could watch this. I still don't get what the directors were trying to tell in this one. Families with no affections are not worth portraying, in my opinion. Sometimes there are beautiful stories about wrong relationships, about peoples' mistakes, but definitely not this one.

It is about a couple of very stupid families, who live their lives in a very stupid and unhappy way. As a result, their children are also a bit twisted, all concentrated on sex but in a very strange and twisted, unnatural way. What's the point of the movie is hard to say. The only positive thing to say about this movie is that it is not a typical mainstream holywood film, with no happy ending.

*Strictly to Elijah Wood fans - if you are thinking to buy this movie like me, to see another film featuring his amazing acting, which is truly such in all the movies he did, it isn't worth your money and trouble, because you got to see only glimpses of him in this film but have to suffer to see this film to the end.*",1130630400,6,1409,4.5

937257,4,6304844964,"It's interesting to read the various reviews on this film as I had a bit of a different take on it.

Indeed, much of the commentary was on the seventies, the sexual revolution, experimentation, etc.  I saw it also as a commentary on the human condition.  Everyone has their demons, but all cast members pretty much had their demons under wraps.  This encapsulates the affair between Kline and Weaver, Ricci's experimentation, Maguire's desire to be with Holmes.

However, when their demons get the best of them, when they can no longer manage them, it is translated by the weather.  The weather gets worse, things begin to crystalize and it becomes very dangerous.  They have pushed the envelope too far and nearly everyone's demons bring about significant consequences.

It is only after the height of the storm when time stands still.  The storm passes, seemingly with perfect sync as the various players try to ""pick up the pieces"" of what has happened.

""The Ice Storm"" is an excellent allegory by Lee on the human condition.  The casual viewer may be upset by the content or even the length.  However, to look past it and see the metaphor of the ice storm as it relates to the human condition can make watching this movie a very enjoyable experience.",1123891200,5,1255,4.7592592592592595
937258,3,6304844964,"Can any two families actually be as dysfunctional as those portrayed in this movie? Probably not and let's hope your family doesn't resemble anything going on herein.

From Sigourney Weaver in a shag to Christina Ricci as a 14-year-old questioning the honesty of Richard Nixon to an aging Kevin Kline with lamb chop sideburns acting out a mixed up suburbanite, this movie owes allegiance to certain lifestyles portrayed more readily on screen than in real life during the 1970s.

There were actually ""key parties"" as portrayed in the movie, but I'm sure my parents didn't participate in them. There was certainly a high level of sexual and social experimentation in the suburbs and elsewhere, but it's hard to believe that experimentation filtered down through parents to their very minor children -- and through the children to the very, very minor siblings of their partners. All this is portrayed in this sad film.

This is a very negative memoir of the 1970s, a fatalistic view of a real and metaphoric ice storm -- one that takes a life and another that robs all lives of their vigor, stability and, most of all, morality.

While the 1973 sets, cars, hairstyles and clothing seemed correct for the most part, I don't think there is one outstanding acting job in this movie. All the big name actors look and act just like they do in all their other movies. While the scenes of what seems today like very self-destructive behavior were compelling, it is no different here than in any other film about family dysfunction.

In summary, I can't think of a thing that makes this movie memorable or lets it stand out in a crowded field of either nostalgic or bad acting family movies. It seems to fit the mold, for the most part, not reshape it.",1114992000,8,1743,4.720394736842105

937261,5,6304844964,"I, personally, was not alive in 1973. But the immensely underrated Ang Lee gives a glimpse into the 1970s suburbia when society went through a dramatic shift. A good thing? Don't be so sure. Lee strips away the illusions to reveal the loneliness and coldness in the wake of the sexual revolution.

The Carvers and the Hoods live next door to each other in an affluent suburban neighborhood. On the surface, all is well. But self-absorbed Ben Hood (Kevin Kline) is having an affair with the icy Janie Carver (Sigourney Weaver). Similarly, his precocious daughter Wendy (Christina Ricci) is ""experimenting"" with Janey's sons, the spacey Mikey (Elijah Wood). To make things worse, Ben's wife Elena (Joan Allen) is experiencing a bit of a crisis herself -- she suspects her husband is cheating on her, and she longs for the freedom and lack of care she had before her marriage.

After Ben finds Wendy and Mikey in a compromising position with a Nixon mask, and Elena clues in about Janey, the parents venture to what turns out to be a wife-swapping key party (the women take men's car keys out of a bowl and go home with covers New Canaan, their relationships will reach boiling point... and a tragedy will unfold.

I don't know how common these attitudes were in the 1970s, but undoubtedly they were a lot more common than people would like to remember. Such things as key parties seem almost alien now. Tobey Maguire's Paul Hood serves a vital function in this movie -- he's very normal, not into any sort of transitional weirdness (except pot smoking) and so can serve as an alter ego for the viewers.

Lee did a good job not just with the exquisite direction and the camerawork. He also doesn't overemphasize the sudden shifts in what was allowed and what wasn't -- in one scene, the adults calmly discuss watching ""Deep Throat."" As they speak, there's the nervous awareness that it was unacceptable for upper-middle-class suburbanite not long ago. They have drugs, free love, self-seeking... and they don't have the slightest clue what to do with it.

Lee overdoes it a little with the ice metaphors. The dead leaves and trees were a lot better. But he does do an expert job showing why loveless sex and distant families will only leave a person lonely. The families here talk a lot, but they don't speak. Even a simple question like ""How's school?"" or ""What are you doing?"" is enough to weird out the kids -- that's how far they are from their parents.

He tempers all this heavy stuff with humor, such as Janey coldly telling Ben that she doesn't need ""another husband"" prattling golf stories at her, or the sickish Nixon-mask sex scene. There are a lot of ""seventies"" things sprinkled through the movie -- makeup, toe socks (toe socks?), TV shows, hair, and Weaver's zippered jumpsuit. But Lee doesn't really smack you in the face with it.

Kevin Kline is as good a serious actor as he is a comic one. When someone leers that he wishes people had brought their young daughters to the key party, Kline's expression is worth a thousand words. Weaver and Allen are both excellent as icy women with some warm feelings, and the kids are great: Ricci mixes sophistication and vulnerability as the Nixon-obsessed Wendy. And Wood gives off a sort of ethereal feel as the spacey but sweet Mikey, a boy obsessed by molecules.

This is far from a feel-good movie, but it gives some undefined views into human nature, what is good for us and what isn't. Ang Lee took what could have been a disaster, and made it as cold and beautiful as an ice storm.",1109116800,6,3542,4.665064102564102

I know I'm supposed to view this film as an incredibly artful depiction of the moral dissolution of the 1970s, but I have a very hard time seeing too much beyond an insipid plot constructed around the sexual exploits of characters whose only real tragedy is that their libidos are larger than their IQs.
I suppose the point here is, ""Gee, get out of bed with your neighbor long enough to watch your kids...""  I'm trying not to use terms like ""duh,"" ""disgusting,"" and ""Stooooopid!"" but honestly they are the only ones that come to mind regarding the pinheaded ""theme"" of this film.

Now, the acting...all of it is good; but the most interesting thing to me was how far the youngest members of the cast(Toby Maguire, Christina Ricci, Elijah Wood, and the boy who plays Elijah's younger brother) absolutely outshine the performances of the likes of Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver.  Christina Ricci in particular put in an Oscar-worthy performance as a 14-year old girl in severe psychic pain.  She illicits every range of emotion from the viewer--pity, disgust, righteous indignation, tenderness.  She was only 17 when she did this film and she did everything right.

I initially became interested in this film looking through Elijah Wood's filmography and I AM glad I saw it...will it go down as a memorable experience for me?  Probably not.  It portrays an era that was considered ""flavorless"" (don't yell, I grew up during that decade myself) and unfortunately the film came off pretty flavorless too.",1106784000,5,1687,4.904929577464789

In the comfortable hinterland of Connecticut we are presented with two families during a 1970's Thanksgiving weekend. It's the sexual revolution for the 30 to 40's crowd and the adults all seem to feel kind of special but really can't figure out why they are so so unhappy. They are totally, and I mean totally disconnected with their kids, and pretty well totally disconnected with each other as well.

Matter of fact the movie would be a wonder as an introductory psych class since each of the players has 'issues'. Ripley .... OOOPS I mean Sigourney Weaver treats sex like fast food and manages perhaps to be the best adjusted character in the movie, while her husband is an uptight inventor oblivious to both his chldren and his wife, the young son need major help as he tries to blow up everying in sight, has visions of blowing up his teacher and completely falls appart when he has the opportunity to play 'I'll show you mine if you show me yours' with his older brother's girlfriend. ....

Kevin Kline character is married to a cold troubled cleptomaniac who gets the hots for a crazed funky preacher and really seems to bothered by everything around her .....

Needless to say, the poop finally hists the fan when one of the characters of friends decides to have a California style key party on the Thanksgiving weekend, in the middle of an ice storm, they all try to make it look so so normal ....HMMMM

Everyone takes chances--shoplifting, taking drugs, sexual experimenting, daring of convention--and no one expects to be caught.

And, when her mother starts reminiscing about the innocence of her girlhood days, Wendy says "" Are you all right Mum?"".  Benjamin's (Mr Kline's) attempt to talk about ""the birds and the bees"" to his 16 year old son Paul is frankly hilarious.

Lowpoints: Exaggerated at times, thus distancing itself from unmitigated genuineness; stretched out a little too long for two hours, could have been a tighter script; ending is slightly too clichd.
Conclusion: A thoughtful period drama with a remarkable cast that won't stay with you for too long, but will unquestionably entertain and stimulate contemplation.

Set in one evening of an ""ice storm"" (a combination of winter rain freezing everything into crystalline stillness) used as an overly strong metaphor, it encompasses the lives of several couples and their children.  The topics include unhappy marriages, teen confusion, middle-aged boredom and open infidelity (there is a regular wife swapping party).  Given these unpleasant topics, the film succeeds on Ang's direction and the incredible performances by the actors (Sigourney Weaver, Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, Christina Ricci and Tobey McGuire).  Some of the individual revelations are a welcome sight and many of the teen drug and sex scenes are humorous, although nave and mildly tragic.

For one, it was an American movie made by foreign director Ang Lee, and its depressing dramatic content had the capacity for being a love/hate experience (I recommended this film to a friend, and after viewing it, he called it the worst movie he'd ever seen!). On the other hand, Lee had made arguably the greatest Jane Austen adaptation ever two years previous (""Sense and Sensibility""), and famed critic Gene Siskel added to the buzz by calling it the #1 film of the year. So what's the verdict? Six years later, ""The Ice Storm"" shimmers in its cinematic precision, emotional complexity, and brutal honesty. In fact, this time period under the direction of Lee has its foreign sensibilities as a benefit, taking more risks and being ultimately more effective. The magnificence of ""The Ice Storm"" is by no means JUST Ang Lee's doing - stars Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, Christina Ricci, and a smoldering Sigourney Weaver make you wonder why this film garnered no Oscar wins or nominations. On the surface, ""The Ice Storm"" looks to be overtly concerned with the sexual mores of the 1970's, and that is a great part of the film (who can forget Elijah Wood fooling around with Christina Ricci touting a Richard Nixon mask?). What we see, though, is the dramatic arc of two families that clash emotionally, sexually, and physically one weekend while on the verge of a (okay, blatantly metaphorical) ice storm that threatens some and claims the life of one. Lee and his actors handle certain moments with such quirky sensiblilites it's hard to dislike the movie (a scene where Weaver scolds Ricci for playing an ""I'll show you mine if you show me yours"" game comes to mind). Inevitably, though, the movie's dark overtones take full manifestation of the film in its final act, and that is where the true brilliance of ""The Ice Storm"" shines through. All of its compelling visuals, foreshadowed themes, and subplots synthesize to its unforgettable, somewhat ambiguous conclusion. THIS is where some people fall off the ""Ice Storm"" wagon. What is important about the film, though, and what makes it one of the great forgotten films of the '90's, is how the collective experience of the movie is more important than simply its conclusion. Too often, movies rely on a finale to tie up its loose ends and convince the viewer one last time to like it. You'll love ""The Ice Storm"" early on, for it's an unbelievable pleasure to simply sit and watch great filmmaking happen every frame of this fantastic, overlooked film.",1064534400,3,2650,4.788209606986899
937421,5,6304844964,"""The Ice Storm"" is a gorgeous adaptation of Rick Moody's novel of the same name. It is expertly acted, with a stellar cast: Kevin Kline, Sigourney Weaver, Joan Allen, Elijah Wood, Tobey MacGuire, Christina Ricci--to name just a few.
Without going into too much detail about the film's plot, I will say that it is set in the 1970's, is very much a critique of that era in middle America; it is a story that addresses bleak issues, is told within a bleak setting--a winter ice storm, and pretty much functions as a study of moral ambiguity carried through two generations: we see the parents struggle with life-decisions, just as we see their children do this, as well. It is a beautifully told story that, despite its tragedy, never falls into sentimentality. And remarkably, I think it is a story that is mostly about redemption and forgiveness.
Not a light film by any means, but an absolutely rewarding one in every sense of the word. Why this didn't win Best Picture I couldn't say, except perhaps that it's *too* smart for the Academy to digest.",1063929600,2,1049,4.675675675675675
937422,5,6304844964,"Often made to stand alongside American Beauty or the evergreen Ordinary people in its depiction of ordinary people with extraordinary idiosynchrasies, Ice Storm clearly got drowned out by the Spacey/Benning combination in the late 90s. Which is a tad unjust. While it is anyone's guess which Kevin I'd go for on a regular day (Spacey, that is, instead of Kline) this movie also has Ang Lee at the top of his game turning in quite a captivating film.
I know little about Connecticut, and even lesser about the town of New Cannan (where the movie is based), but the appeal of the movie, the nonchalant realism of its characters, and the theme of our daily facades with the simple human quirks behind them are all strikingly universal. This is an insight into the lives of married couples in small towns coping with adultery, drinking, wife swapping and indifferent children.
As almost any other of Lee's works (with the possible exception of Crouching Tiger) the narrative is subdued. The characters, too, are rather darker than typical Lee, bordering on murky almost. Some comedic moments, with varying success I might add, don't do much to take from a dour overall tone. You may be left feeling you eavesdropped into a suburban home, listening to actual tete-a-tetes among its inhabitants.
I noted that this has led some other reviewers to think of the performances/direction as ""wooden"", or Sigourney Weaver to have been ""wasted"", etc. But people with isseues - such as most of the characters in Ice Storm - have a way of becoming cold, pretentious, nervous in their attitudes. I appreciated that Lee does not make any effort to masquerade their emotions into some sort of heroic Hollywoodesque melodrama. Real people behave this way, I did not find it wooden at all.
The ""1973-era nostalgia"" may be a bit lost on me (has the world really changed that much?) but I'd say this is a marvellous movie nevertheless and definitely worth at least the rental dollar. Doesn't matter whether its characters were based in Connecticut, Cairns or Calcutta, the saga of human foibles is all the same.
Highly recommended for the discerning eye.",1051228800,8,2131,4.905817174515235
937423,1,6304844964,"The Ice Storm is one of Alison's favourite movies. It is, I've been told, a masterpiece. This, however, seems to come more from the seventies atmosphere that the movie immerges itself in than any merit of the story.
Tobie McGuire is as far as we get as a binding force : I say this because he opens and closes the movie, much like good High Dramas do. In fact, it has all the trappings of a High Drama : voice-overs that purport to enlighten, characters who mingle in dramatic ways, children with unusual views on life, and so on. What it has to say - family is the only stable thing in our lives, while proceeding to completely destroy this addle-brained premise, and that existentialism consists of doing whatever one wants, whenever good or evil - is insane, and so is the happenings. All the adults are immature, cheating ..., and all the children are typical rebellious, drug-addled brats.
The story ? There is no story, only stereotypes which evolve in a context of growing doom, and then an ice storm (which provides us with the best thing in the movie - the visuals of ice and icicles), and then... a cheap resolution.

937425,4,6304844964,"""The Ice Storm"" centers around two neighboring families, the Hoods and Carvers during a winter in the 70's. Kevin Kline of the Hood family plays Ben, a self centered husband who is having an affair with his neighbor
Janey played by Sigourney Weaver. They indulge in their loveless affair as Ben's wife Elena played by Joan Allen finds herself yearning for her inner youth and trying to escape her boring life. At the same time both families teenage off springs are experimenting with sex and drugs. Wendy(Christina Ricci), the daughter of Ben and Elena fools around with Mikey played by Elijah Wood. Tobey Maguire plays Paul who wants the beautiful Katie Holmes even if drugs are involved. This all happens as an ice storm approaches and climaxes at a ""key swapping"" party during the height of the storm and a tragedy.
 The Ice Storm is set when the sexual revolution was in full swing and many changes were coming upon America. This film clearly shows how little communication and connection there is between the family members and overall all the people. For example, when Ellijah Wood's father comes back from a business trip to greet his son, Ellijah replies that he didn't even notice he was gone. Janey barely even moves her eyes from her magazine to greet her husband. Throughout the film we barely ever see anyone in a conversation they are deeply involved in. The sense of isolation and sadness runs rampant throughout. Each of the characters is so immersed in their own vices and affairs that they live in their own world, and pay little attention to the others. Mikey and Wendy either fool around or awe at the TV, but they never have much to say to each other. This is the sad state people are entering, one where they feel alienated and unable to express themselves. This applies to the parents just as much. After some sex, Janey doesn't permit Ben to talk about his golf because she feels she already has her husband for that. There is no real affection between the characters. When Elena tries to have an affair with Janey's husband to retaliate for her husband's affair, it is devoid of passion and rather clumsy.
 The film features excellent cinematography of the cold atmosphere and the beauty of the ice storm. Each of the actors plays their parts righteously cold. None of them are very likeable but this shows just how disconnected each of them are. Ben is so full of hypocrisy and shallowness, that when he finds his daughter having dry sex with Mikey he lectures and preaches to even though he was there to commit an affair. However it is the final moments of the film where he releases his tears due to the tragedy that just happened and that he has just realized how truly pathetic his existence is. One of the best characters in the play is that of Christina Ricci's. She becomes sexual with other boys because it gives here a sense of power and control. From her mere facial expression we sense she is lonely and hardened. Tobey Maguire plays his character with creepy aura. The final 15 minutes of the film have little dialogue , but are emotionally filled as a terrible tragedy strikes.
 The Ice Storm is such an important film because even though it is set in the 70's it is still relevant today. While many families appear to have stability and happiness, underneath they are not. The people in society are becoming disconnected and isolated through a loss of communication and boredom of their lives. They indulge in sins and pleasures just to break from their apathetic lives while damaging their self worth and morals. Ice Storm shows the deterioration of the traditional American family and relationships between people effectively with subtlety rather than making it over the top and sensationalist. A great film of how family has changed and the effects of loneliness and lack of expression.",1040169600,21,3829,4.746246246246246
937426,5,6304844964,"Quite simply one of the most elegant works in cinematic history.  Ang Lee has proven himself to be one of the most versatile and sensitive directors in modern cinema.  The treatment of the story is subtle and heartbreaking-- you feel so deeply for these characters, who all move through life in a dazed state of isolation, unaware of how damaging this calculated lack of connection can be.  All these characters
share in common a fear of vulnerability that robs them of the fulfillment of their most basic human needs-- the love and companionship of others.
In this way, the themes are similar to ""Happiness""-- but the storytelling in ""The Ice Storm"" deals more with disconnectedness and less with shame and self loathing, so it is much easier to watch (""Happiness"" is a movie I think most people only see once).  Every character in this film is a perfect whole, while not all even likable (particularly Sigourney Weaver's character, Janey), their imperfections breathe life into each portrait.  The ensemble cast is riveting.
There are definite elements that may upset some-- such as the open presentation of childhood sexuality.  Be prepared to be painfully reminded of your own tentative and awkward first steps toward adulthood, or what most kids think of as adulthood-- i.e.
sexual relations.  ""The Ice Storm"" deals with this with sensitivity and dignity, which is a refreshing change from the sexualization of children so prevalent in the media, which has the distasteful undertones of serving up innocents for the consumption of adults.  The kids in this movie are learning about themselves within the realm of other kids, the way we all experienced it.

It is also about family, love, longing, terror, winter, the 70s, etc. etc. etc.  The complexities are endless.  Somehow, the film seems so simple and clear amidst all the knottiness.  Ang Lee does this like no one else.

He's given us a lighthearted gay comedy (""The Wedding Banquet""), Jane Austen fiction (""Sense and Sensibility""), martial arts fantasy (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""), and comic book fare (2003's ""The Incredible Hulk"").  Here, he challenges the stereotypes and conventions of suburbia in the sorely underrated 1997 drama ""The Ice Storm,"" which is just as witty and incisive as its Oscar winning counterpart ""American Beauty.""  The year is 1973, and the location is New Caanan, Connecticut, where two neighboring families slowly fall apart at the seams due to indifference, infidelity, and neglect.  As an ice storm breaks out, tragedy strikes, forcing both families to unite and examine their lives and prior behavior.  I saw the storm as some sort of symbol, creating a signal for both families that trouble is on the way, and neither family even realized it.  Without revealing spoilers, the cast is near-perfect.  Kevin Kline and Joan Allen work well together as a couple struggling with their marriage while raising their kids (which include the usually good Christina Ricci).  Sigoruney Weaver is also in fine form, as are Elijah Wood, Tobey Maguire, and Katie Holmes.  The film perfectly captures the mood and flavor of the 1970s without making too-obvious references, and director Ang Lee triumphs by moving the film at a good pace.

Symbolized by the corruption and debacle of Nixon, it was a time when many lies that we had accepted about the role of our nation and its leaders were shed.
Of course this questioning of authority and the mores of society extended to the family, and the directory brilliantly portrays the complexity of the situation in ""Ice Storm"".
The family very often appears as a sham.  In order to ""keep up appearances"", one has to feign love and pretend to enjoy the so-called ""togetherness"" of patriarchal authoritarianism.  An instance of this is the ""Thanksgiving scene"" in the movie.  Almost every American has experienced one of those boorish holidays around the table with family members, when s/he would prefer to be somewhere else with other people.
The movie demonstrates the efforts of middle-class America to go beyone the staleness of the nuclear family.  Often this involved empty sexual promiscuity.  It also demonstrates the failure of those efforts.  As a result of those failures, the
experimental middle-class would soon champion the thermidorian reaction called reaganism in the 1980s.  The finals scene of the movie shows the family remassed and willing to ""give up"".

The main thrust of the is that insecure people do a lot of dumb things if they cannot find love (a hint: everybody in this story is insecure). Maybe all the characters should have followed Sigorney Weaver's character's advice to Christina Ricci's character and gone off into the desert. They all act (adults and teens) like adolescents.
Perhaps there is a broader lesson to be drawn from this very well done picture: When the foundations of sand that we--as a society--build for ourselves crumble, those without a more lasting foundation are bound to suffer. The folks in this movie sure do.

937508,5,6304844964,"The difference between adolescence and adulthood can be defined in terms of years or age, but when it comes right down to it, the only real difference is in the experiences the added years provide.  As we mature, we are at some point confronted with the realization-- some sooner, some later-- that age and experience do not necessarily equate to satisfaction and personal identity in our lives, the two things we are all, though perhaps subconsciously, striving to attain.  But it's an elusive butterfly we're chasing; and at a certain age, the lack of fulfillment in one's life may be dismissed out-of-hand by some as a midlife crisis in a feeble attempt to justify certain actions or attitudes.  Attaching such a label to it, however, is merely simplifying a state of being that seems to be perpetually misunderstood, and we resort to using psychological ploys on ourselves in order to rationalize away behavior that is often unacceptable in the cold light of reason and morality.  This, of course, is not a unique situation, but an inevitable step one takes upon reaching an age at which the awareness of mortality begins to set in, which is something we all have to deal with in our own way, in our own time.  And it's an issue that lies allegorically at the heart of director Ang Lee's pensive, insightful drama, ""The Ice Storm,"" in which we discover that-- more often than not-- the adult we become is nothing more than an extension of the adolescent; we may shed the skin of youth, but the awkward confusion and uncertainty remains, albeit manifested in different ways, to which for awhile we may respond in opposition even to our own conscience, creating a double standard in our lives which only serves to exacerbate the confusion and unhappiness, leaving us alone to face the cold and frozen landscapes of our own soul.
 Working from an insightful and intelligent screenplay by James Schamus (who also wrote Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Eat Drink Man Woman,"" among others), Lee has crafted and delivered a lyrical and poetic-- though somewhat dark-- film that tells the story of two neighboring families living in Connecticut in the early `70s:  Ben and Elena Hood (Kevin Kline and Joan Allen) and their children, Paul (Tobey Maguire) and Wendy (Christina Ricci); and Jim and Janey Carver (Jamey Sheridan and Sigourney Weaver) and their children, Mikey (Elijah Wood) and Sandy (Adam Hann-Byrd).  And it's a story to which many will be able to relate on a very personal, individual level, as it reflects an issue common to us all-- that of trying to make a tangible connection with someone or something in our life that we can hold on to and take comfort in.  Ben and Elena have grown apart; she has distanced herself emotionally and sexually from Ben, and unfulfilled, she longs again for the freedom of her spent youth, while Ben seeks solace in an emotionally vapid but physically satisfying relationship with another woman.  Jim, who spends much of his time on the road, has become completely disconnected from his entire family; his children are apathetic to his very presence, and Janey exists in a constant state of promiscuous numbness, yet cold and indifferent to her own husband.
 The Hood and Carver children, meanwhile, are suffering the pains of adolescence and trying to figure out the world in which they live, exploring their feelings with and for one another and attempting to understand the whys and wherefores of it all.  And to whom can they turn for guidance in an era that's giving them Nixon and Watergate, new age spiritualism and self-absorbed parents who teach one thing and do another?
 The story unfolds through the eyes of sixteen-year-old Paul, whose meditations on the literal and figurative ice storm that descends upon the two families over a long Thanksgiving weekend forms the narrative of the film.  And it's through Paul's observations that Lee so subtly and effectively presents his metaphor, in which he captures the beauty, as well as the ugliness, that inexplicably coexists within and which surrounds the turbulence and turmoil of the Hood's and Carver's world, which is ultimately visited by tragedy as their drama proceeds to it's inevitable climax.  It's sensitive material that will undoubtedly touch a nerve with many in the audience, and Lee takes great care to present it accordingly, with a studied finesse that makes it an emotionally involving and thoroughly engrossing drama.
 Lee also knows how to get the best out of his actors, and there are a number of outstanding and memorable performances in this film, beginning with that of Kevin Kline.  Kline does comedy well, but he does drama even better, as he proves here with his portrayal of Ben.  The final scene of the film, in fact, belongs to Kline, as it is here that we discover the true nature of the man he is in his heart of hearts.  It's a superb piece of acting, and one of the real strengths of the film.
 Joan Allen also turns in a strong performance through which she reveals the insufferable inner conflict that so affects Elena's life, and especially her relationship with Ben.  And it's in Allen's character, more than any of the others, that we see how fine the line is between the adult and the adolescent.  It is not unusual to find a bit of the mother in the daughter; but Allen shows us through Elena just how much of the daughter is actually in the mother, which underscores one of the basic tenets of the film.  It's a performance that should've earned Allen an Oscar nomination at the very least.
 Also turning in performances that demand special attention are Maguire, Ricci, Wood and especially Jamey Sheridan, whose portrayal of Jim is one of his best-- it's believable, and totally honest.  Penetrating and incisive, ""The Ice Storm"" is remarkably poignant and absorbing; without question, it's one of Lee's finest films.",1016409600,8,5877,4.870611835506519
937509,5,6304844964,This movie is a hauntng and realistic peice of work. Ang Lee brings a set of emotions to the screen that will leave you looking at your own relationships and what may be hidden beneath them. I highly recomend this film. It changed my whole way of lookin at things.,1013472000,,264,4.3
937510,5,6304844964,"I adore discovering ""forgotten"" or little talked about movies from time to time, whether on television, videoclub or old movie theaters. ""Ice storm"" is one of them. It's simply a hidden gem.

  Quite everything and everyone seems to be disfunctional in this movie: Nixon's presidential reign, the family, the parents-children relationships, the coming of age. Not a single character seems to be happy, enjoy himself or having a good time; even in the few funny scenes one doesn't have the feeling that the characters involved in it are getting some pleasure. Their actions aren't simply motivated by the need for sex or their abundant libido; there's a glaring shared desperation for communication between them which seems to be paralyzed by their own dullness and unhappines. There's a cold relationship between almost all of them: the children have no real connection with their parents, the adults on their side having so much problems with each other, agenda oblige.

  Every child character seems in desperate need for love, communication and comprehension: ""I love you"", says one of them. ""That's sweet...are you drunk?"" answers the other. Every adult character seems unsatisfied with his/her empty life, always in search of what is missing, although they don't seem to know what is missing in their existences. After having consumed an adulterous physical intercourse, one of the characters begins to talk about a serious subject (one of the few times in the movie). ""You're boring me...I already have a husband!"" answers the other.

  This is the tale of some common human beings desperately wanting to love and be loved, and yet permanently in anger, trying to drown their desperation and emotional drought in shoplifting, extra-conjugal relationships or blowing model planes up in flight. ""The ice storm"" is the undeniable truth with an inevitable ending, no matter what games adults and children play; the ice storm is beautiful and menacing in its beauty, as one of the characters, marvelled by this beauty, succumbs to it.",1013040000,,2035,5.179878048780488
937565,5,6304844964,"After the huge success of  ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", audiences are watching closely Ang Lee's works, but they should better see his previous works, like this ""The Ice Storm"", to find out that his latest is not a fluke. By the way, this film is one of the most underrated film of 1997.
""The Ice Storm"" follows a couple of days in the lives of two ordinary American families which happen to be very related in many senses. In 1973, these people will experience love, discoveries, pain and death. The `70s are known as the decade of the dialogue, but the film is very silent and the characters don't talk very much. Sometimes, when a problem does not have a solution the only thing to do is stay quiet. And they do it all the time.
The movie tackles subject very common by that time. All the characters seem to be dealing with sex somehow. The teens are starting to touch their bodies and also their friends'. The adults look so bored that having sex is meaningless no matter whom they do with. Even a `car key party' does not help them to feel much more excited.
Lee's direction is discreet and effective. The photography goes very fine with the temperature of the characters' feelings. It's so effective that even you being in your warming home can feel the cold breeze freezing your skin. It's frightening to see how damaging frozen water can be. Michael Danna's score helps to make the audience feels cold, as the people in the movie. The cast is flawless, mainly Chistina Ricci, Tobey Maguire and Elijah Wood. The script wirtten by David Schamus-- based upon Rick Moody's novel --was awarded in Cannes and is very impressive -- even tough some of the most painful parts of the novel were left out.
The title ice storm that falls nearly the end of the picture is merciless. And its results, devastating. It seems to reach every character's heart somehow. Nevertheless, there are no easy solutions -- or even any solution -- to the edgy situation they are living. So they will have to live with their frozen hearts forever. The closing sequence is a punch in the stomach. And David Bowie's ""I Can't Read"" makes this punchs be even harder.",1011916800,13,2146,4.603133159268929

We have the sexually charged daughter Christina Ricci who manages to seduce both the boys from the other family causing havoc. It doesn't stop there - Tobey Maguire, Elijah Wood, Joan Allen and Adam Hann Bryd all contribute to the crazy events within the movie.

937569,5,6304844964,"You can tell just from the first shot in The Ice Storm that it will completely envelop you.  The crackling sound as the train comes to a stop on a cold Connecticut night, the beautifully poetic score by Michael Danna, the twinkling trees and landscape revealing a calm after the storm.  You have a feeling that the beauty is masking a lot of desperation and vulnerability.  It is a really bold piece of New American Cinema.  Tackling the same old issues, but in a way that is startlingly fresh and revealing.
Kevin Cline is great as a fumbling, bored NY businessman who finds a tragic way to rock the family suburban lifestyle.  And Joan Allen is amazingly sparse in her portrayal of an early 1970's housewife who finally confronts her husband's infedelity.  Tobey Mcguire (who also narrates the film) and Cristina Ricci, as their children, give equally delicate and involved performances.  Sigourney Weaver is given her best role here, as the swinging wife of Jamey Sheridan, who is supposedly the genious that helps develop silicon from sand.  Rounding out the cast is Elijah Wood as their troubled son, and Adam Hann-Byrd as his younger and more eloquent brother.
Overall, It's an beautifully interwoven story of the miscommunications between two neighboring families.  And it really confronts the overtone of the early 1970's era, by setting up parallels between the harsh political climate (a la Watergate) with what is hapenning between the two families.  But I think the most meaningful and touching aspect is how we see love (or at least a sexual awakening mistaken as love) blooming between 2 teenagers in a way that is heartbreakingly real.  I really appreciated how they made the experiences between these young characters appear genuine, loving, and meaningful.  It isn't often that a film captures what love feels like for someone so new at it.  I think one of the delicate ironies of the film is that, despite their youth and inexperience, these people's children  probably have a better understanding about what love is really about than they do.
I think the film is also about a loss of innocence, but not necessarily a loss of sexual innocence.  It shows how sometimes children are thrust into adulthood because of traumatic events in their lives, and they often times loose a part of themselves in the process.  The ending is truly devastating, but so poetically rendered and realistically fleshed-out.  It really makes you feel an incomprehensible sadness that is never really resolved before the film ends, which is infinately refreshing.  As we all know, there isn't always a fitting way to console the heartbroken.  So maybe its best to just leave it at that.
It probes deep into the intricate concepts of love, family, betrayal, and loss.  It is as delicate a film as they come.  Surely the best film Ang Lee has ever done.  And i think greatly overlooked as possibly one of the best films in the past decade.",996364800,19,2932,4.880808080808081

Hopefully this film will attract the audience it deserves to have, but hasn't had for the last 4 years of it's existence. Sense and Sensibility is well worth the time also.

Sigourney Weaver plays the neighbour (she is married but I cannot think of what actor plays her husband). Weaver and Kline are having an affair, and only in the end does their infidelity become obvious. The film illustrates the divisions and emotions that come between people and how time changes relationships. The film also expertly captures the time frame and its ""search for self"" attitudes.

937573,5,6304844964,"Ang Lee's ""The Ice Storm"" is a brilliant, beautiful but haunting film that shows us how the sexual revolution of the 1960s brought about emotional devestation, once it hit the suburbs of the 1970s. This is a portrait of two upper middle class families who are trying to find themselves in the decade of Watergate and Vietnam, where sex, drugs, and infidelity are among the many obstacles to confront them. We are shown adults who act like adolecents and adolecents, who are too quickly trying to become adults. Ang Lee does an excellent job of recreating the era through architecture, music, wardrobe etc., but where he really triumphs is in creating an emotional framework which makes us care about these people. All the actors involved with this movie give near perfect performances. Special mention should be made for actors, Kevin Kline and Joan Allen, who show us a couple, who's relationship is in a downward spiral. How this film failed to get any Academy Award nominations let alone win any Oscars is beyond me. The DVD version of this movie gives us a crisp, clear beautiful picture. The only fault I can find with it is that the special features section is a bit on the skimpy side. Would have loved to have had Ang Lee or some of the actors do a commentary track.

I caught it on video as a rental once and was hooked (can anyone remember this movie being promoted very much while it graced the silver screen?). This is one of the most spectacular movies of the decade, and one which I most surprisingly (and against all trends) must say was SUPERIOR to the novel that predates it. James Schamus' screenplay, coupled with Ang Lee's directorial ability (see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon for an altogether different application of his talent, also Sense and Sensibility) makes a beautiful and purified adaptation of this novel: the cultural and emotional fallout stemming from American catastrophes like Watergate, the Vietnam War, and the broken and aimless aftermath of the political protest era of the Hippies.
Set in a wealthy Western Connecticut rural suburb, The Ice Storm is the story of two affluent families whose lives intertwine over a Thanksgiving weekend.

The story of upper-middle class white America in crisis in 1973 is really the story of how the turmoil of the 60s threw the moral certainty of the American family into question. But more than that, the film brilliantly illustrates Lee's most powerful theme: how the failure to communicate -- to really speak our thoughts, feelings, and desires -- becomes the downfall of his characters. The ice storm of the film's title is the physical manifestation of their crisis, and its effects on the climactic night results in death for one of the characters -- and a thawing for the others.

At times, the movie moves a little slow...but it projects the same sort of feeling you'd get if you were bored during bad weather, cabin fever...if you will. The weather is very crucial to the metaphor-based story. I thought it was a beautiful film, I highly reccommend. Sigourney Weaver turns in a small but power-house performance as the bored mistress.

She's played by Katie Holmes whose tackling of challenging roles has sadly kept her from mainstream success.  The story weaves itself together and out again with nothing too dramatic happening until the end and even then it's tame by today's standards.

A very well acted, emotionally moving  story of 2 families that just can't seem to find a decent means of  communication, and struggle trying to find some thing in their lives to  make things better.

Set during an ice storm sometime in the seventies, the film  centers around two families, but mostly around the family headed by Kevin  Kline's character. Kevin Kline hits a sober note a adulterous husband and  father who loves his family but needs a tragedy to free him to admit it.  Sigourney Weaver, as his married neighbor and sex partner, gradually comes  to realizations about her life. She is a woman awakening, but destined for  loss. Tobey Maguire, as Kline's son (a perfectly believable visual match,  btw), steals every scene he's in as he follows his mother's cuckolded  footsteps. His younger sister, played suberbly by the fierce and lovely  Christina Ricci, clings to her father and baits the neighbor boys.
There  is a brutally lovely scene of the windchimes on the porch, covered in ice.  But I don't want to spoil the movie. This film is visually gorgeous with  angst-o-meter readings off the chart. For those who like that sort of thing  (as I do), don't miss it.",963100800,5,1295,4.903225806451613

It is almost perfect in every shot - either with the  beautifully cinematographed kiss scene between two teenagers, or the scene  where a young boy balances on an icy diving board, where we sense tragedy  coming.
It all makes sense in the end. It's a powerful film about  confusion - confusion about marriage, confusion about adultry, confusion  about who we are, confusion about what we do - and the way director Ang Lee  handles it is so sad.
It's sad because it was completely underrated. It  had an amazing cast - so amazing I was completely stunned. Christina Ricci,  Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, Elijah Wood, Tobey Maguire, Sigourney Weaver,  Katie Holmes...

It's extremely refreshing, as someone who actually lived through the '70s at the same  stage as these kids (and, in my case, grew up in a similar social milieu)  to see a movie that gets it right. Lee, unlike most Hollywood directors,  avoids the trap of going overboard with clothes, hairstyles and cultural  references when depicting an era in recent memory. They're there, but to  the extent that they actually were there at the time. (In fact, he leaves  in some anachronisms ... when Christina Ricci steals from the drugstore,  the Tampax boxes behind her are contemporary). As a result, he can let the  actors focus on the characters. Kline is great, Allen lets one of her  repressed wives finally get some action at the end, but Sigourney Weaver  does the best job of making you think you've never seen any other movie  with her in it. I also love Elmes' cinematography ... his best work since  <i>Blue Velvet</i>. He uses the Connecticut woods and  modernistic interiors, cool colors and earth tones extraordinarily well.  The real and figurative coldness that thus saturates the film can actually  make you want to put on a sweater. Lee also gets credit for one of the most  sublime (and thus, ahem, shocking) death scenes since  <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> near the end of the movie. My only  complaints would be that a) the film too often leaves one character or the  other hanging for too long while it concentrates on other plot threads and  b) Lee is a little too overboard with his symbolism, showing characters  breaking ice or opening refrigerators more than necessary for us to get the  point.",962668800,3,1665,4.809187279151944
937690,4,6304844964,"Superb filmaking.  Another title for this film would be a snapshot of the private lives of the fictionalized Carver and Hood families.  Taking place on the day before and night of an Ice Storm, the story gradually unfolds of  adolescents sexual experimentation, adults adultery and general odd and  peculiar behaviour from otherwise outwardly normal and respectable people.  Finely acted out by all the cast, the passionless way of telling the story  leads towards the inevitable effectively surprising and somewhat pathetic  outburst of emotion at the end. The strange dental  anaesthetic-like  atmosphere is at first off putting and unsatisfactory, though it is a  reasoned and intelligent assumption which allows a clarity with which to  observe the characters antics. This film for me was about the bedrock of  family in a community and the natural yearnings and forces which pull  against the traditional relationships in a society. Dealing in adult  themes, slow paced and expertly directed this film provides  thoughtful  viewing. It's like American Beauty without the comedy or phyisicallity, a  more haunting beauty.",962236800,2,1125,5.4476744186046515
937691,5,6304844964,"""The Ice Storm"" was one of the most haunting and visually hypnotic films of 1997.  The entire cast turn in excellent performances, especially the young cast which include Christina Ricci, Tobey Maguire,  Katie Holmes and Elijah Wood.  One of the most impressive performances was  from Sigourney Weaver as Janey Carver.  She had a small but pivitol role  which garnered her a Golden Globe nomination and British Academy Award for  Best Supporting Actress.  I was very disappointed that not only her but  others in the cast were overlooked when it came to the Oscar nominations in  1997.  The whole issue around family suburbia during the sexual revelution  was very well presented on film due to Ang Lee's superb direction.  Even  though Ang Lee didn't receive the well-deserved recognition for his  direction of this film, he would go on to earn a nomination for ""Sense  & Sensibility"".  ""The Ice Storm"" also earned the Best  Screenplay Award at the Cannes Film Festival but no Oscar-nomination.  I  highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a visually haunting film  with impressive performances from an excellent ensemble cast.",960681600,7,1135,5.092896174863388
937692,5,6304844964,"This is a very remarkable film to see connected with the word ""Hollywood."" It is fairly stunning visually, aurally, acting-wise, script-wise, in fact: pretty much everything-wise! If you're  looking for a movie to shake you up (Come on, you've got to have a dose of  that some time!)this is the one. Lee creates a whole world, taking us into  the vulnerabilities of his characters in a way that will make you weep,  flinch,and maybe even think! He gets startlingly honest and unstarry  performances from his whole cast, not least the stunning Joan Allen and the  kind of acting some of us had given-up hoping for from Kevin  Kline...
This is what film-making is about (sorry, I said 'film' not  'movie'!)- real visceral use of the medium, rather than simply feeding us  baby-food. Watch, and be moved for a change.",957312000,,814,4.798561151079137
937693,5,6304844964,"""The Ice Storm"" is a film that is so layered with symbolic meaning that it demands multiple viewings. Otherwise, it would be much too easy to brush off the film as a cold, depressing, and pointlessly bleak  portrait of the lives it depicts.
On one level, Ang Lee's film is about  two upper-middle class New England families--the Hoods and the Carvers--and  how they are forever impacted by the sexual revolution of the 1970s. On  another level, this film concerns the healthy balance that Nature provides  and how subverting this balance can lead to destructive, and even tragic,  consequences.
In both the Hood family and the Carver family, the parents  essentially behave like children, while the children, who have no reliable  (or respectable) authority figures to supervise them, stumble precariously  into the arena of adult sexual awakening. Ben Hood (Kevin Kline) and Janey  Carver (Sigourney Weaver) engage in an extramarital affair with one another  because their spouses do not sexually satisfy them; Ben's wife Elena (Joan  Allen) is frigid and Janey's husband Jim (Jamey Sheridan) is impotent.  Essentially, Ben and Janey are so engulfed in their own selfish wants that  they are oblivious to the potentially destructive consequences of their  actions on their families.
But their spouses are certainly not without  foibles of their own. Elena Hood suffers from a mid-life crisis of sorts  that leaves her longing to be free of adult responsibilities. In one scene,  Elena watches wistfully as her daughter Wendy (Christina Ricci) rides past  her on her bicycle, and a bit later we see Elena herself ride a bicycle  into town and get caught shoplifting, which, incidentally, is a petty crime  that her daughter is also involved in. And then there is Jim Carver--the  clueless, mad scientist type who is so obsessed with his work that he has  never learned to communicate with his own children. When he asks his sons  Mikey (Elijah Wood) and Sandy (Adam Hann-Byrd) how school is going, the  boys are so puzzled by what should be a mundane inquiry that they cannot  give a coherent response.
Indeed, failure of communication is a theme  that is prevalent throughout ""The Ice Storm."" Just as Jim cannot  talk directly to his children, so Ben fails to do so with his own. There is  a notable scene in a car between Ben and his son Paul (Tobey Maguire) in  which Ben awkwardly attempts to broach the subject of masturbation. It is  obvious to everyone but Ben that Paul is at a stage of adolescence where he  would be fully aware of such issues. The puzzled look on Paul's face  confirms his own astonishment at his father's cluelessness. Similarly, when  Janey Sheridan scolds Wendy Hood for sexually coming on to her younger son  Sandy, she does so not through a forceful reprimand but by spouting out  obscure, irrelevant facts about Eastern cultural traditions.
What becomes  painfully clear as ""The Ice Storm"" progresses is that the lives  of these two families are slowly but surely spiraling out of control, and  someone is ultimately going to have to pay for these sins. The time of  reckoning finally arrives on the night that both the Hood and the Carver  adults converge on a key party while a fierce ice storm strikes the area.  The key party--in which the husbands toss their keys in a jar and the wives  sleep with the men whose keys they randomly fish out--marks the lowest  possible point of moral abandonment by the Hoods and the Carvers. Director  Ang Lee effectively intercuts these crucial scenes to reveal that as the  party progresses inside, so the ice storm rages outside--as if to vent  Nature's fury at the chaos that man consistently chooses to embrace over  the natural order.
When the storm finally clears, and the effect of the  alcohol wears off, what rises with the morning mist is a tragic revelation  that wrenches all characters from their careless moral and spiritual  slumbers. This is a devastating finale, and what is even more heartbreaking  is the silent understanding that, for these two families, tragedy was  clearly a necessary evil.",956534400,17,4086,4.9236417033773865
937694,5,6304844964,"All those who have not yet seen the Ice Storm are simply virgins to film. Based on the tragically comic novel by Rick Moody, the screen version encompasses equal wit, heartache and intelligence as it follows the  disintegrating lives of two New England families. The story carefully  observes how  the actions of parents can affect their children,  specifically focusing on the impact of adultery, vanishing love and  mistrust set amidst the sexual revolution and 70's kitsch. An ice storm  then occurs, acting as a powerful metaphore for such proceedings, as well  as drawing a tearful close to the film itself.  A superior script allows  for poignant performances, most notably from Christina Ricci as the  alienated and Lolitaesque daughter of Kevin Kline and Joan Allen, and also  from Sigourney Weaver as Kline's married mistress.",956188800,2,835,5.203007518796992
937695,5,6304844964,"I rented this movie on a Christmas Eve last year and haven't been the same since. The sadness, the angst, the coldness of our modern existence are all laid out here for all to see. Desperately, the characters try to add some  sort of pleasure to their staid suburban lives but end up feeling  cold....Sigourney Weaver blows me away with her performance, she should  always do serious dramatic work instead of being exploited into  ""comedy"" or disasters like Alien Resurrection.  The young tobey  maguire is heartwrenching, his voice overs are incredibly moving. I love  every aspect of this film and I think that it is sad that American Beauty,  a completely inferior film takes home oscars while The Ice Storm was  virtually ignored. Forget the no-talent establisment Kevin Spacey and go  for this film to see a Kevin Kline you've never seen before.",954633600,20,850,4.881118881118881
937696,5,6304844964,"The previous reviewer is dead on with the comment that Lee is kind to his hurting protagonists. This movie could have been another one of those 'we're so superior' sendups of an awful era. Instead, Lee feels sympathy  for a group of people who were caught up in a time of such uncertainty. All  the characters rise to the occassion to deliver graceful performances of  confused people.
This movie is darn good looking, too. The ice storm  scenes were fantastic and just as I can recall as well. The hair styles,  sets and clothes were accurate and not overdone - it makes me think more  forgivingly of the fashion sins of the time.",953769600,,631,4.539823008849558
937697,5,6304844964,"Gene Siskel was dead on when he named The Ice Storm the best film of 1997.  It's visual style resonates, and the performances are wonderfully true.
Ang Lee's camera is respectful...  it is easy to imagine the  exploitative qualities this film could've undertaken with a different  director, but Lee is (smartly) tender towards his hurting subjects.",951609600,2,348,5.160714285714286
937819,1,6304844964,"As a book, Rick Moody's The Ice Storm was a fitting testimony to some of the harsh realities of being a `baby-boomer'. The indulgence, the confusion, the dysfunction--told with reverence, painfully, honestly. Good  enough.
But  there's some artsy know-it-alls in New York who are just the  right age, to have been on the wrong end of the 70's -and they further want  to show us how bad they had it. They are selfish, small people. And we're  so tired of their act, that we hardly listen to them anyway. So they scream  louder. And we could really care less.
So they make a movie about their  pain. Which to them is the loudest scream they can make. And we really  could care less.
Wasted on this effort are some first rate talent, Kevin  Kline should be perfect, as should Sigourney Weaver and Joan Allen, and as  maestro who better than Ang Lee, the artisan to craft this work? All  wasted.
Instead of painfully honest, it's just painful. Stay away if you  can.",950313600,8,962,4.52906976744186
937820,5,6304844964,A very powerful film! One of the greatest I've ever seen. Why this film was over looked at the oscars I don't know. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN NAMED BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR! Kline is having an affair with Weaver. Maquire  has fallen head over heels for Holmes. Ricci is looking FOR ANYBODY!  And  Allen is having doubts about her marriage to Kline. SO IT'S JUST YOUR  TYPICAL FAMILY!  Ang Lee(Who is a director I never heard of before this  film)does a great job here. The writing is terrific! Everything in this  film is completely believable!  Maybe YOU will find yourself relating to  one of the characters!  I certainly did! I'm always shocked when I see in  movie I can say is great in this day and age. So much is just junk.

937821,5,6304844964,"A chilling ending, that's all I have to say. This sex-saturated film has an all star cast, Weaver, Allen, Kline, Ricci, Maguire, and Wood, that all portray their charecters wonderfully. The message is powerful, although  confusing, and some parts drag. I found myself fast fowarding to the good  parts (there were MANY good parts) and it mainly had me at the edge of my  seat. The direction is good, and the diolaouge is better than in SOME  movies. I could relate to some of the charecters perfectly. I really liked  this movie.

937822,4,6304844964,"For those of us who spent at least part of our youth in the bell-bottomed, wide lapelled '70s, The Ice Storm is sure to provide some nostalgia.  But lest you think this stark, wistful film is all about memories, let me add  that its themes of betrayal, acceptance, and familial love extend far  beyond a mere time capsule.
The acting is brilliant every step of the  way. Sigourney Weaver, in a small but essential role as Ben dragon lady  lover, evokes the insipid self-centeredness of the ""me"" decade  better than a whole slew of Bee Gees videos ever could.
There's a  powerful almost Scandinavian chilliness to The Ice Storm. Ironically,  instead of freezing your emotions, its writing, acting, and directing draws  you in, and in its final moments warms you to the core.",944956800,4,773,4.7518796992481205
937823,5,6304844964,"I think Ang Lee did an exeptional job with The Ice Storm. I, for one, am tired of seeing the same thing over and over again. This movie changed that. We get to see the under belly of suburban life in the 1970s, how it  really was.
Lee shows us the lives of to dysfunctional familes. Kevin  Kline and Joan Allen have a daughter, Ricci, who experiments sex on their  parents friends, Weaver and this other guy's son. What Allen and Weaver's  husband doesn't know is that Kline and Sigorney are having an affair.
This movie has great preformances from: Kline, Weaver, Allen, Ricci, and  Wood. I would suggest this movie for anyone who liked Blue Velvet or  American Beauty. See this movie. You won't be dissapointed.",944870400,5,713,4.574803149606299

937825,2,6304844964,"Strange, cold, and somehow subtley disturbing drama. Unfortunately, most of the characters, and their actions, are too abstract to allow the viewer (or me, anyhow), any feeling of particular empathy or identification with  them. It's just sort of odd, and I would've like to have seen these  characters explored in more detail, so that we could understand them a  little better. The only truly enjoyable thread of the tale is the one  revolving around ... um ... the main kid ... forget his name ... the elder  son of the main family. The rest of the movie is just sort of strange,  which generally speaking would be fine with me, but in this case, it was a  brand of ""strange"" that I just didn't know what to do with. I was  rather bored with the film at points. However, somehow, despite the cold  and alienated feel generated (onto the viewer, mind you) by the brunt of  the movie, the end manages to be extremely moving. After an hour-and-a-half  of relative indifference to the film, it somehow left me in tears. Go  figure.
