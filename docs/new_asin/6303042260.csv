559781,5,6303042260,"""Young and Innocent"" is not one of Hitchcock's best-known films, and this is a shame. It is one of his most entertaining films from the 30s, featuring suspenseful situations, charming characters portrayed by excellent actors, snappy, witty dialogue, and fabulous camera work. This under-appreciated film deserves more viewers!
The story revolves around a destitute writer who is accused of murdering a truly bitchy movie star. Locating his missing raincoat seems to be the key to proving his innocence and finding the real killer, but between an incompetant attorney and policemen wanting a quick end to the case, he seems destined to hang. But that is until he slips from the courthouse during a moment of confusion. He is joined in his mad dash for evidence by the domestic, yet-tomboyish and strong-willed daughter of the local chief of police. Will the unlikely pair manage to clear our hero's name before he is recaptured by the police?
This film shares a number of similar elements with the better-known ""The 39 Steps."" Unlike that film, in which the modern viewer is able to see the end coming about twenty minutes before it arrives, however, ""Young and Innocent"" keeps the viewer on the edge of his seat up to the very end. The climactic nightclub scene is particularly well-done and thrilling.",1012953600,,1302,5.0046082949308754
559782,3,6303042260,"Young and Innocent is not an especially well known Hitchcock film and to an extent this is justified. When one compares it with his great British films of the thirties, such as The Thirty-Nine Steps or The Lady Vanishes, it seems a minor work. There is no real sense that the characters in Young and Innocent are in genuine danger and thus the chase story lacks tension. The relationship between the two leads lacks the spark that is so often found in Hitchcock films. This is partly because Derrick De Marney's performance remains stage-bound and Nova Pilbeam was considered too young to engage in sexy dialogue. Thus the film lacks the amusing and slightly risqu banter which might have been present if the lead actress was, for example, Madeleine Carroll. The story is similar to The Thirty-Nine Steps, but Pilbeam is far too ready to go on the run with De Marney. I'm not suggesting that Hitchcock should have used handcuffs again, but he really needed to provide some motivation for a policeman's daughter going off with a possible murderer other than a vague belief in his innocence.
While this film is not first-rate Hitchcock it has some very fine scenes. I particularly liked the scene where a group of policemen hitch a ride with a farmer transporting pigs, for it shows Hitchcock's quite daring humour, as `pigs' is impolite British slang for policemen.
The print used for the Laserlight DVD is good. I noticed one slight cut where a swear word had been censored, but this probably occurred in the thirties. Otherwise the print seems complete and is clear with only minor damage. The dialogue is at times a little indistinct but can almost always be followed.
The extra features on this DVD are nothing special. The best thing about the Cheney Vase is Hitchcock's mocking of the sponsors in his introduction. The story itself is quite dull.",985737600,4,1851,4.80564263322884
559783,4,6303042260,"I admit to having not seen the beginning of this movie (although I intend  to rent it soon). I caught it on tv at some late hour,and although i was  not impressed immediately I soon found myself intrigued by the light humor  and mystery of the film. I had the advantage of not knowing it was  Hitchkock when I was watching it,and therefore did not expect great  suspense. Although a compelling mystery,the film is not like many of  Hitchkocks films,as it's real strength is in the humor and the romance.  Although,not a deep story the charachters are extremely likeable and the  dialogue enchanting. It is a really enjoyable movie.
I know you don't  care,but as i was watching it I thought I spotted Hitchcock,but couldn't  belive it was his film...I guess I was right.",968025600,,769,4.6716417910447765
559784,4,6303042260,"This 1937 chase demonstrates Alfred Hitchcock's genius for film language, utilising editing of images to replace expository dialogue. The man accused  of a murder he did not commit and seeking help from a resistant woman is a  theme Hitch would return to regularly, though the woman's eventual  capitulation to the man's sexual advances is a less amusing one. Here it is  given a murky Freudian association by making the woman a teenager and the  man a father-figure, with her mother absent from the family. Consider the  closing expression of joy on the girl's face when she has united both lover  and father. This aberrant behaviour extends to the black-faces worn by an  orchestra, and the twitch of the murderer, revealed in a dance-hall  setpiece with a justifiably famous long crane shot leading to close-up. He  even twitches as if the close-up is too close to bear. Removing the culprit  from the body of the narrative is a clever idea (it's like a variation on  Marion Crane in Psycho), though cynics might observe that limiting the  actor's over-the-top performance to be the real reason. The images that  reveal the murder are perversely beautiful, including an extraordinary  close-up of seagulls in flight, which of course brings The Birds to mind.  There is also a mine collapse which is almost poetic, and a Bacchanalian  diner brawl. The combination of beauty and violence seems to be a very  Hitchcockian thing. The film features an unusually lush romantic score and  wonderfully naturalistic performances from the supporting players. When you  see Hitch's cameo, as a chubby frustrated photographer, you can tell from  his sense of humour how contagious his joy of movie-making would be. Of  note is his direction of children, with a birthday party being particularly  funny, and the heroine's dog. As the protagonists, Derrick de Marney and  his accomplice Nova Pilbeam are effective, though their self-conscious  underplaying seems veddy veddy British, and it's no surprise that they  didn't have the same future success Hitchcock would have in Hollywood.",965520000,,2075,5.137724550898204
559785,4,6303042260,"'Young and Innocent' was one of the last of Hitchcock's 1930's films I got round to watching. Seldom on television and rarely mentioned, I was therefore surprised at just how entertaining the movie is. Because it is an  'innocent man on the run' picture it inevitably gets overshadowed by 'The  39 Steps', 'North By Northwest' and all the others, but 'Young and  Innocent' has a really pleasant, easy going style missing from the other  films. For once Hitchcock shows the good side of human nature rather than  the dark nasty side. Nova Pilbeam and Derrick De Marney were never cut out  to be major stars but they keep the story ticking over nicely with very  competent performances. Laserlight also deserve praise - they have used a  very good print, so no complaints about picture quality. To be honest, I  don't really care about the other features on this DVD. I only bought it  for 'Young and Innocent' and I'm glad I did so.",962064000,,931,4.656441717791411
559786,4,6303042260,"Once one gets past the hokey over-acting in the opening moments, the viewer is in store for an entertaining cat-and-mouse thriller featuring one of the earliest uses of Hitchcock's favorite ""wrong man being chased  by the authorities"" plotline.  Highlights include an amazing mine  cave-in scene and an extended crane shot in a crowded ballroom, as the  camera slowly moves in closer and closer to the real killer, finally  settling in on just his nervous, rapidly blinking eyes.  The second feature  on the Laserlight DVD, ""The Cheney Vase"", isn't much to write  home about.  It's an early, undistinguished episode from the ""Alfred  Hitchcock Presents"" TV show.  It was clearly made from a kinescope of  dubious quality, and the story about a priceless vase just isn't very  interesting.  However, the nice print of the main feature; the bonus  trailer from ""Strangers on a Train"" (also a good print); and the  low price make this Laserlight DVD worth picking up.  I have to agree with  Dr. Struhl's review, though:  the Tony Curtis introductions included in  these Laserlight editions are tolerable at best, but ultimately don't bring  anything of value to the table.",956275200,,1169,5.079365079365079

The cast does  not consist of well known names, but nonetheless they do good jobs with  their performances. The resolution of the story could have been stronger,  but this is overall a very engaging and entertaining film, well worth the  modest price. The transfer is clear and from better prints than you usually  see, and the sound about as good as one can expect from this vintage  (1937). If you avoid the painful brief introduction and conclusion by Tony  Curtis--who seems to be in very bad health--you will find much to enjoy  here.",949363200,5,819,4.963235294117647

559909,5,6303042260,"Stumbled onto this film and loved it so much I had to have it on DVD!  This is an early Hitchcock, but you can really see where he was going.  Remember the famous long camera shot in Notorious?  This film has a long shot that is even more amazing.  He (Hitch) was also developing the romance between the leading characters, clever, smart dialog, not at all dated.  Works just as well today.  The birthday party is brilliant.  Another great bit about this film is all the different characters, maybe on film only a few moments, but adding another dimension.  Highly recommend this!",1365724800,,580,4.617647058823529
559910,5,6303042260,"I first watched this on Amazon's instant video, then again as part of a set of 8 Hitchcock films that had all been remastered. If you can get the remastered DVD, that's the way to go, as it also includes an excellent commentary track and some other extras. But if you want to just see the film and aren't ready to invest in the DVD, the image and audio on Amazon are certainly acceptable.

The movie itself is excellent, with a famous shot that takes the viewer from the entry to a ballroom all the way up to a close-up of the eyes of the drummer in the band. The lead characters are great together, with a believable chemistry, and there are lots of the usual trademark Hitchcock touches.

This has become one of my favorite of Hitchcock's British-era films.",1360454400,,759,4.414285714285715
559911,5,6303042260,"I love this Hitchcock film - his stuff is great, some of my favourite classic films from the early to mid 20th cent. You can't go wrong with this one - an innocent girl lead along by a cheeky but dashing suspect - how can you not love him!!",1355702400,,240,3.9183673469387754
559912,5,6303042260,"Not in the same league as his classic films but a long time favorite of mine, I never see it but to be caught up in the Hitchcockian romantic sheen to a Man Unjustly Accused movie. As usual, the heroine is innocent but competent, independent, but easily caught up in commitment to a man she feels society has wronged. She is the Complete Insider willing to endanger her status security for the right man. The major players in the film do a first rate job, the supporting cast, as usual, provides some comedy relief, but mostly creates a firm foundation for the action among the featured cast. There is some sharp camera work, no dead spaces, humor, interpersonal stress, and a bang-up denouement. I do recommend it for a pleasant evening.",1338163200,,738,4.641221374045801
559913,4,6303042260,"It's not as first-rate, perhaps, as THE 39 STEPS or THE LADY VANISHES, but it's very much along the same lines, and part of the really fun streak of famous films Alfred Hitchcock made right before the war, when he came to the United States to make REBECCA. Handsome, Roman-nosed Derrick de Marnay is accused of murdering a wealthy actress who left him quite a bit of money; he has to enlist Nova Pilbeam (she of the strange eyebrows), a wealthy constable's daughter, to help him clear his name. Loosely based on Josephine Tey's A SHILLING FOR CANDLES, this 1937 film is a wild ride, and though it holds together very well in terms of plot its mostly an excuse for some very good thrill sequences. Several of them seem to be clearly homages to the great silent serials of Louis Feuillade: there are a couple of very close shaves with cars speeding to beat locomotive crossings (these are accomplished with some beautifully precise miniature sets) and even a car in a collapsing coal mine. The most famous of all is the lengthy sequence at the hotel tea dance at the end with the famous dolly shot  from high in the ballroom down to the real killer's eyes, which give a telltale twitch for which the heroine is searching; perhaps almost as accomplished is the shocking first sequence with the killer and his wife (the victim) loudly arguing, which segues first to the killer stepping outside the house during a rainstorm hatching his plans, and then to down the cliff the next day as the wife's body and the murder weapon (a raincoat belt) gently roll up together onto the beach. There are some fun throwaway gags with children, including one with an enthusiastic young boy at a gas pump and one with another enthusiastic boy named Harold at a kids' birthday party. This new restoration of the film on this DVD looks terrific; the interviews with Francois Truffaut and Peter Bogdanovich that appear as extras have appeared elsewhere in print form and are hardly worth hearing (particularly the Bogdanovich interview, since the younger director hadn't even seen YOUNG AND INNOCENT before interviewing Hitchcock).",1263600000,,2109,4.793956043956044
559914,4,6303042260,"The more time I spend watching Alfred Hitchcock's British films from the 1930's the more I like them.  The latest film I have sampled is 1937's ""Young and Innocent"".  Released in the U.S. as ""The Girl Was Young"" this motion picture grabbed my attention from the compelling opening scene and simply never let go.

As is so often the case in a Hitchcock film the plot revolves around an ordinary person who finds himself caught up in an extraordinary situation.  Robert Tisdale (Derrick De Marney) is a struggling young writer who is simply in the wrong place at the wrong time when the body of a prominent young movie star washes up on the beach.  Tisdale knows the victim and starts to run for help.  He is spotted by a pair of young women and is ultimately accused of doing the deed.  The victim had been strangled and the murder weapon appears to be the belt from a trenchcoat.  Conicidentally, Tisdale owns such a trenchcoat but it had been inexplicably stolen from him just days earlier.  With the circumstantial evidence mounting against him Tisdale manages to escape from police custody.  He hooks up with an attractive young lady named Erica Burgoyne (Nova Pilbeam) who just happens to be the daughter of the local Chief Constable.  Tisdale sets off on a desperate attempt to find his missing raincoat which he believes would vindicate him.  Young Miss Burgoyne thinks him guilty at first but gradually comes to believe in his innocence.  The balance of ""Young and Innocent"" revolves around the desperate search for that trenchcoat, the cat and mouse game between Tisdale and Burgoyne and the authorities and the slowly blossoming relationship between this most unlikely couple.  In general, I found ""Young and Innocent"" to be a bit lighter than most of the Hitchcock films I have enjoyed over the years.

But the piece de resistance in ""Young and Innocent"" is the closing scene that ultimately reveals the true idenity of the murderer of this young woman.  Tisdale and Burgoyne ultimate track down the missing raincoat which was in the possession of an aging derelict known as Old WIll (Edward Rigby).  Old Will finally surrenders the coat but alas the belt is missing.  Old Will insists that he was given the coat by a man with a very distinctive twitch in his eyes. Just when it appears that all hope was gone Tisdale discovers a small but important clue in the trenchcoat pocket.  It was a box of matches from the Grand Hotel a place Tisdall had never been to.  The trio immediately heads for the hotel in search of the man with the twitching eyes.  For my money the closing sequence of ""Young and Innocent"" is one of the most unexpected and cleverly filmed finales in any Hitchcock movie that I have seen.  Outstanding!

Overall, I found ""Young and Innocent"" to be the best of early Hitchcock films I have sampled thus far.  I had never even heard of this one before.  I urge you to give it a look.  Highly recommended!",1262390400,,2931,4.686888454011742
559915,5,6303042260,"Really a pleasant surprise, on a par with Hitchock's The 39 Steps.

559916,5,6303042260,"For the uninitiated, any film from the 30s, especially a British film, would be a bit of a shock.

But if you like Hitchcock, or you were ever in love as a teenager, you'll want to own this film. Nova Pilbeam (a wonderful young lady who four years previous had played a little kid in Hitchcock's first version of ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"") plays a teenager who rightly believes that a young man is innocent of murder - which makes her an accomplice on the run from her beloved father, the police chief. The movie is mostly Nova trying to help him prove his innocence - a plot that Hitchcock used over and over again for 50 years, yet somehow we never tire of it.

I've seen all of Hitchcock's films. Every one of them is worth watching multiple times. This may be one of is top five (I may be wrong - maybe it's one of the top ten).

Buy it immediately. It will never look better than this; if it doesn't strike you to the core, then you're probably lifeless.",1235779200,3,961,4.211956521739131
559917,5,6303042260,"While rarely mentioned in the same breath with ""The 39 Steps"" or ""The Lady Vanishes,"" this is my favorite film from Hitchcock's British film catalog. It has charm, a great story, lots of atmosphere, a fine romance, and best of all, the wonderful Nova Pilbeam. Based on a Josephine Tey novel, ""A Schilling For Candles,"" this story of an innocent man wrongly accused of murder and the young girl who aids his search for proof that he did not commit the crime is a ton of fun.

This is a top-notch British production from the period. There is good photography from Bernard Knowles and a nice score from Louis Levy to make this one of Hitchcock's most enjoyable outings. Nova Pilbeam was a lovely young British actress who had worked for the director in a smaller role three years earlier, in his first version of ""The Man Who Knew Too Much."" She sparkles here as a strong and independent young heroine who comes to believe in someone and risks everything to aid him.

Derrick De Marney also shines as a young writer named Robert who happens upon the body of famous cinema star, Christine Clay (Pamela Carme), washed up on the beach. He had a passing acquaintance with her since she had purchased one of his stories. He is seen running from the scene to get help, and when it is discovered she was strangled with a belt from a coat he had stolen from him at a place called Tom's Hat, things don't look good for our hero.

It looks even worse that she left 1,200 pounds to him in her will, and when his attorney appears to be a boob, Robert escapes in order to prove his innocence. He gets the reluctant help of the Chief Constaple's daughter, Erica Burgoyne (Nova Pilbeam), in escaping to an old mill for the night, taking the chance she will not turn him in to her father. There is a romantic attraction between the two, and the independent young Erica decides she must help him a little to avoid the gallows.

When she comes to bring him food and drive him around to search for the man who stole the jacket which will prove his innocence, she and her little dog get in deeper and deeper. There finally comes a turning point when Erica throws caution to the wind and zealously helps Robert pursue the man with a twitch in his eye who murdered Christine Clay. It becomes apparent to both her father and the police that she is aiding him willingly and not under duress. Since they have already slipped up and aroused suspicions at a birthday party her aunt and uncle were thowing for her niece, they know they can not remain at large forever and it becomes a race with time to find the real killer.

A long desired quality release of this film from a major studio has finally been realized. Interviews of Hitchcock by Bogdanovich and Truffaut accompany a still gallery and a restoration comparison. Commentary with Hitchcock authors Stephen Rebello and Bill Krohn are included as well. According to releases, it will also be close captioned and have both French and Spanish subtitles for those in need of them. Hitchcock creates a very nice atmosphere of an English coastal town in the 1930's and all his touches are in evidence even at this early juncture. This is one of the great Hitchcock films from his British period and stands with the best of them. Nova Pilbeam is terrific here and it is a real shame she did not get to make more films like this one. If you enjoyed ""The 39 Steps"" you will probably like this as well. It does not quite have the tension of that great film but has a little more romance and charm. A real winner!",1231113600,35,3531,4.468217054263566
559967,5,6303042260,"I saw this film on TV recently.  It draws the viewer in right away with the dead body washing up on the beach and man who is wrongly accused.  It has Hitchcock's trademark humor and suspense.  It could have been more tightly edited in parts, but as I watched the ballroom scene near the end, all I could think was, Hitchcock is a genius.  The camera scans the room and in a very restrained and patient way, zeros in on the killer as the characters try to do the same.  There is also a little bit of Vertigo in the mine shaft scene.",1159142400,2,531,4.116504854368932
559968,4,6303042260,"*** This comment contains spoilers ***

Many of Hitchcock's early films share story elements because he used the same writer (Charles Bennett) for the screenplays. So you find ""Young and Innocent"" sharing the beginning of ""Sabotage"" by immediately revealing the identity of the villain/murderer, turning both films from mystery/thriller into simple thriller. And it shares with ""The 39 Steps"" a hero on the run with a reluctant heroine, as they work to clear his name they fall in love.

A woman is found dead on a beach, the police determine that she did not drown but was strangled with the belt of a raincoat. Robert Tisdall (Derrick De Marney) is the prime suspect, in part because he was observed running from the scene and in part because he is known to have owned a similar type of raincoat. Robert's claim that his raincoat was stolen at a lorry station a few days before is not believed and his court appointed barrister does not inspire confidence. So he escapes and with the help of Erica Burgoyne (Nova Pilbeam) dashes about the countryside seeking the elusive raincoat in order to clear his name. As a further complication Erica's father is the chief constable.

Like ""The 39 Steps"", the story has a lighter tone than most of Hitchcock's thrillers; nicely blending comedy with suspense. It lacks that films interesting technical elements but does feature a nice climatic sequence where a continuous crane shot moves slowly over a crowded dance floor to end inches away from the twitching eyes of the murderer who has not been shown since the opening scene of the film.

The film seems to be hacked up a bit, jumping in and out of scenes at inappropriate times as if a poor job of trimming was done and incompletely restored sometime in the almost 70 years since the original edit. This is disconcerting but not fatal, as the themes of disguise and visual impairment are still quite clear. Robert escapes from the courthouse by donning his defense lawyer's glasses-which impair his vision; Old Will dresses up in a new suit in order to infiltrate the hotel but is too concerned with the police to spot the murderer, the murderer appears in blackface but has trouble seeing because of a nervous tick in his eyelids. Ironically it is the medication he takes for this condition that causes Erika to finally notice him.

Hitchcock's skills in casting and directing actors is rarely mentioned but he had a amazing ability to select an actress at the perfect moment of her career for the performance he needed. Nova Pilbeam was only 18 during the filming but she had considerable experience as a child actress. This allowed her to play a confident and capable heroine, and yet project a charming navet. Her resemblance to Kiera Knightley is almost spooky, going beyond simple appearance into speech and mannerisms.

This time the ""MacGuffin"" is the raincoat and it enables Hitchcock to have a double chase for most of the film, as Robert pursues his raincoat he is being pursued by the police. For those who have never heard this, a ""MacGuffin"" is Hitchcock's term for a plot device (often used in thrillers) that motivates the characters and advances the story-but has little other relevance to the story itself. Unlike other types of plot devices it is not important what specifically the object is, anything that could serve as a motivator could be used. And from an audience perspective the MacGuffin is not the point of the story. Thus in ""Young and Innocent"" the hero and heroine pursue the raincoat only to discover than it will not be useful for the purpose they intended. It then goes from central focus to insignificance.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1153526400,,3684,4.801261829652997
559969,4,6303042260,"Though Hitchcock is no stranger to comedy in his films, this film strikes a particular resonance in that it is a lot more slapstick, a lot more oddball, and just overall a lot more funny than most of his films.  Depending on what you think of his films (and it's probably that he's a master of the form and that all his films are amazing, because that's what everyone thinks), this might be interesting or... it might not.  Why not Hitchcock take a comedic approach?  Hitchcock is God!

Okay, what am I saying?  Anyway, this film has the usual collection of circumstances... a man on the run, wrongfully accused of a crime... a blond who gets involved with him but also has to deal with her own dilemmas beyond his de jure guilt...  birds...  suspense...  but it's all a lot more light-handed and airy, with a lot more emphasis on fate and chance that makes it funnier than serious.  As the characters go on their oddball romp through the world, it's in a way a lot more interesting to watch their various chance encounters than to get caught up in the common man who is wrongfully accused of something.  I'm not saying Hitchcock's other work is bad, I'm just saying it's nice to have this added in as well.

It's not quite as precise and formed as a lot of his other work, but it still maintains a high level of discipline and still is a well-crafted piece of work.  Definitely enjoyable.

559971,5,6303042260,"One of Alfred Hitchcock's early British films, YOUNG AND INNOCENT is fairly light and innocent itself, but its theme is one that would be revisited many times by Hitchcock: an innocent man is accused of a brutal murder and must go on the run to prove his innocence. It is no secret that Hitchcock himself harbored a healthy mistrust, even dislike of the police, and this is one of the earliest of his many films in which a police investigation is misguided and it is ultimately up to his endangered protagonist to solve the case at hand.

Derrick De Marney plays the young man, Robert Tisdall, who stands accused of the vile crime and Nova Pilbeam plays the daughter of the local police constable. She first falls into reluctantly aiding the boy and, ultimately, she falls in love with him. Just three years earlier, Pilbeam had played the abducted child role in Hitchcock's first version of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH; she is playing her first adult role here and is quite effective as the resourceful young woman Erica.

YOUNG AND INNOCENT is a charming film about a young romance, albeit in the unexpected setting of a fugitive hunt. De Marney and Pilbeam can't help but be extremely likeable in their roles. The plot holds sufficient interest to keep a modern audience engaged throughout the film and the outcome of the film is, of course, satisfying.

Hitchcock's movie-making craft is in full maturity in this film. Apart from the aforementioned plot elements which would become the staple of his work, Hitchcock's camera work in YOUNG AND INNOCENT is innovative and effective and, as he has explained, ""[substitutes] the language of the camera for dialogue,"" a skill for which he was later much renowned.

Look for Hitchcock's bit part in YOUNG AND INNOCENT as he plays a press photographer fumbling with his camera in one of his most amusing cameos. Anyone who has a passing interest in the films of Alfred Hitchcock owes it to himself or herself to check out the British films that he made prior to 1940. YOUNG AND INNOCENT is one of the best representatives from that body of work.

559973,3,6303042260,"Alfred Hitchcock's 1937 ""Young and Innocent"" filmed in England with predominately unknown, to me, players is not what I would consider one of his better efforts.  Following chronologically 39 Steps, Secret Agent and Sabotage it unfortunately is merely a lukewarm drama of a man wrongfully accused of murdering a famous actress Christine Clay.

In the opening scene we see Clay played by Pamela Carme in a heated argument with her ex-husband who's furiously jealous of her bevy of young paramours.  We next observe a woman in bathing attire wash ashore to be observed from some overlooking cliffs by Robert Tisdall played by Derrick DeMarney.  DeMarney climbs down to find the woman is actually Clay and is obviously dead with a belt washed up nearby the body.  We learn that DeMarney was one of Clay's boyfriends.  He runs away to get help but is obseved by two bathers who assume that he is the guilty party fleeing the crime.

DeMarney is soon apprehended and charged with the murder which was caused by strangulation with a belt from a raincoat.  Unfortunately DeMarney had jusr recently lost his coat at a roadside cafe and therefore couldn't prove his innocence.

While at the courthouse a prisoner snafu allows DeMarney to escape.  He is aided by the chief constable's young daughter Erica Burgoyne played by a baby faced Nova Pilbeam in his escape.  Reluctant to help at first, she gradually becomes convinced of DeMarney's innocence.  They travel to the roadside cafe to find his coat had been taken by an old tramp Will played by Edward Rigby.  Old Will helps them try to find the murderer, remembering that the man who gave him the beltless coat had a face that twitched incessantly.  A matchbook found in the coat lead them to the Grand Hotel were they try to identify the real killer.

Despite the mediocre quality of this film, Hitchcock followed ""Young and Innocent"" with the classic ""The Lady Vanishes"" proving that he hadn't lost his touch.",1118361600,,1956,4.849397590361446
559974,5,6303042260,"You know its a good movie when the use of blackface (i am african american by the way) actually works and doesn't hurt the film.  Quite exciting and humorous throughout.  I found the film better than ""The 39 Steps"" because I never saw the ending coming.  It is quite original.  Both of the leads are also very appealing as are the rest of the supporting cast.  Standout scenes are the action sequence at the mine and the scene at the nightclub.",1097452800,3,444,4.432098765432099
559975,4,6303042260,"When I review these Laserlite Hitchcock DVDs, I tend to put more empphasis on the film transfers rather than the film itself, mainly because every other film review available talks the plot to death. So I write my reviews with the assumption that the reader already knows the plot of the film.
...As far as the film goes, this is one of my personal favorite Hitchcock films. It's a terrific re-working of The 39 Steps about a man who is accused of a murder he didn't commit and must flee from the law and find the real culprit in order to prove himself innocent. It was a formula that would become a regular part of the Hitchcock canon for years to come.
...As far as the DVD goes, it's just okay. Once you get past the mediocre Tony Curtis intro, you get enjoy the crackles and pops, light-to-dark contrast jumps and cut-off lines of dialouge and jump-cuts resulting from missing frames that most any other home video edition of the film will provide to you. This isn't to say it's a terrible and unwatchable transfer. This is definately no ""Murder"" or ""Skin Game,"" but it's also a disappointment when compared to Laserlite transfers of ""Sabotage"" and ""Rich and Strange."" The movie never at any point becomes unbearable from the transfer, but Laserlite has done better....Still, it's probably the best copy available so far on DVD, but I would ultimately recomend Criterion's Laserdisc, if you still have a laserdisc player, until Criterion reissues this on DVD.
extra features include a trailer for a later Hitchcock film and a foregettable episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents that he did not direct. Laserlite cannot be bashed for this, as it is a better bonus than just nothing.
4 1/2 stars to Hitchcock for an excellent film, 3 stars to Laserlight for trying hard, but not hitting the mark every time.",1044316800,16,1807,4.7215189873417724

7837479,5,6303042260,"I really loved this film. The thing that keeps me interested in this film is that the romance between the two major characters is quite intense. It is a murder mystery/wrong man/buddy film thriller which Hitchcock so often produced. As many of Hitchcock films, this one combines the thriller with plenty of comic moments (such as a bar-room fight) as well as dangerous one (where Erica almost falls into a collapsing mine with her car). The film's pace is as fast as most Hitchock's wrong man thrillers and it keeps you on edge.",1459814400,,528,4.688172043010753
7837480,5,6303042260,"Having hit his stride with The Thirty-Nine steps, Alfred Hitchcock's Young and Innocent abounds with confidence and great story-telling. Its a murder mystery thats one-part chase, one-part comedy, and one-part romance, rendering the initial crime incidental. Hitchcock could have had any actress he wanted as the leading lady but chose 18-year-old Nova Philbeam, who stood out in The Man Who Knew Too Much as the couples kidnapped daughter.  Even at that time, Hitchcock said, she had the intelligence of a fully grown woman.  She had plenty of confidence and ideas of her own.  He respected her acting chops so much he also wanted her to star in Rebecca, but that was not to be.  In Young and Innocent she gets top billing.  The man on the run (and Philbeams love interest), played by Derrich De Marney, is fine but decidedly second fiddle to Philbeams charisma and pluck. Three scenes stand out: (1) a dead womans body washed ashore on an empty beach, and De Marney seen fleeing the scene, (2) the mineshaft sequence where De Marney rescues Philbeam from plunging to her death, and (3) the climatic scene in the hotel ballroom where in one shot the camera, starting above a chandelier at the far end of the dance floor, lowers to the floor, maneuvers through the whirling couples, approaches the bandstand, and closes in on the drummers face.  An extreme closeup reveals the drummers madly twitching eyes that identify him as the killer.  A great Hitchcock thriller, clever dialogue, and an intelligent stand-out leading lady.  Clean digital reproduction, good sound, but no English subtitles (for shame).  Five stars.",1459555200,,1620,4.992565055762082
7837481,5,6303042260,"Now restored, this is one of the terrific British Hitchcock's to add to your collection. Equal to Man Who Knew Too Much, 39 Steps, Lady Vanishes, minus the dark undercurrent of political intrigue, Young And Innocent is more a pleasurable chase through the English countryside, a love story, a light thriller, a comedy, more Capra-esque than Fritz Lang.
As pointed out in the voice-over special features, Young And Innocent languished for decades in bad public domain copies and had eluded the status with American audiences it deserved. Nice to see the print updated beautifully in this MGM release. With subtitles and a commentary by a couple of Hitchcock aficionados, this is the copy to buy for $8.00 or so. Or to watch in Amazon streaming.
The more British Hitchcock films restored the better. Jamaica Inn is now in great shape through Cohen films (though regretfully not subtitled), Criterion has done Man Who Knew Too much, 39 Steps, and Lady, and MGM has Sabotage and The Lodger out. Hope someone does Secret Agent and Blackmail some day soon, these are essential to the Hitchcock canon.",1455062400,2,1094,4.951086956521739
7837482,5,6303042260,"A face slapper and a twitcher part ways, shes discovered the next day, beached like a dead mackerel.  A boob (Derrick De Marney as Robert Tisdall) discovers the body and dashes off to get the police just as two silly and stupid girls happened upon the same body.  Even though the boob notified the police, he becomes their only suspect because the silly and stupid girls insisted that he ran off, that he really wasn't fetching the help that he did indeed bring back to the scene of the crime!!!  Which makes the coppers every bit as stupid as the two girls.  Its a case of he said/they said, and two against one always wins.  So the boob goes on the run to prove his innocence.  He accidentally, more or less, kidnaps a young woman (Nova Pilbeam as Erica Burgoyne), who has the misfortune of being the daughter of a Chief Constable.  Somewhere along the way, she begins to have sympathy for the poor boob.  Its apparent at the outset that the constabulary are trying to railroad him on less than circumstantial evidence.  Hes even given a court appointed barrister who is blind as a bat and twice as incompetent.  The fix is in!

This is a fun comedy with little to no suspense and certainly no mystery.  The story consists of this couple trying to track down the real killer.  The standout scene happens when they park their car in a mine and the ground gives way beneath them.  A must for fans of Hitchcock.",1453248000,,1410,4.45703125
7837483,3,6303042260,"Young and Innocent, 1937 film

It is a dark and stormy night. A man argues with his wife  he wants a divorce. The mornings light shows a womans body on the beach. The sea gulls attack the body. A man is seen running away; he says he sought help. He is detained for questioning. The police link him to the murdered woman. A lawyer is assigned to defend him. There are humorous scenes that parody the Justice system. A photographer is outside the entrance to the courtrooms. The prisoner escapes. [Believable?] Somehow he finds a car with the constables daughter, their adventure begins. The dinner table conversation tells about the family. The youngest son has shot a rat in the backyard.

The suspect plans to find his raincoat and prove his innocence. A dog barks a warning, there is a close escape from the police. Questions about a coat cause a fight in the restaurant. Some don't like the answers. We see how birthdays are celebrated. There is more subtle humor. The pair leave, unaware of the call to the police. There is a crisis that binds them closer, the police are after them. They find the tramp that had the coat, he can describe the man who gave him the coat. There is a sudden danger when they hide in an old mine. Erica is found by the police, and returns home. What can her father think?

Will they ever meet again? Is there a clue in the pocket of the coat? Can Old Will find the man who gave him that coat? Then the camera shows the band playing. Is there a clue here? The viewers know who it is, but Erica and Old Will keep looking. The police show up. Erica offers to help the stricken drummer, and uncovers the truth in a dramatic confession.

Alfred Hitchcock made many films using the story of an innocent man fleeing from the police with a girl who helps him. It appealed to audiences. Unlike some other mysteries there is no last minute surprise revelation of the murderer. The suspense is in watching and waiting until the guilty party is found out. This scheme is used in many movies to avoid the problem of revealing the ending. The husband is the prime suspect when a woman is murdered. [Does Actual Innocence prevent a conviction? Not necessarily.]

7837484,5,6303042260,"The more time I spend watching Alfred Hitchcock's British films from the 1930's the more I like them.  The latest film I have sampled is 1937's ""Young and Innocent"".  Released in the U.S. as ""The Girl Was Young"" this motion picture grabbed my attention from the compelling opening scene and simply never let go.

As is so often the case in a Hitchcock film the plot revolves around an ordinary person who finds himself caught up in an extraordinary situation.  Robert Tisdale (Derrick De Marney) is a struggling young writer who is simply in the wrong place at the wrong time when the body of a prominent young movie star washes up on the beach.  Tisdale knows the victim and starts to run for help.  He is spotted by a pair of young women and is ultimately accused of doing the deed.  The victim had been strangled and the murder weapon appears to be the belt from a trenchcoat.  Conicidentally, Tisdale owns such a trenchcoat but it had been inexplicably stolen from him just days earlier.  With the circumstantial evidence mounting against him Tisdale manages to escape from police custody.  He hooks up with an attractive young lady named Erica Burgoyne (Nova Pilbeam) who just happens to be the daughter of the local Chief Constable.  Tisdale sets off on a desperate attempt to find his missing raincoat which he believes would vindicate him.  Young Miss Burgoyne thinks him guilty at first but gradually comes to believe in his innocence.  The balance of ""Young and Innocent"" revolves around the desperate search for that trenchcoat, the cat and mouse game between Tisdale and Burgoyne and the authorities and the slowly blossoming relationship between this most unlikely couple.  In general, I found ""Young and Innocent"" to be a bit lighter than most of the Hitchcock films I have enjoyed over the years.

But the piece de resistance in ""Young and Innocent"" is the closing scene that ultimately reveals the true idenity of the murderer of this young woman.  Tisdale and Burgoyne ultimate track down the missing raincoat which was in the possession of an aging derelict known as Old WIll (Edward Rigby).  Old Will finally surrenders the coat but alas the belt is missing.  Old Will insists that he was given the coat by a man with a very distinctive twitch in his eyes. Just when it appears that all hope was gone Tisdale discovers a small but important clue in the trenchcoat pocket.  It was a box of matches from the Grand Hotel a place Tisdall had never been to.  The trio immediately heads for the hotel in search of the man with the twitching eyes.  For my money the closing sequence of ""Young and Innocent"" is one of the most unexpected and cleverly filmed finales in any Hitchcock movie that I have seen.  Outstanding!

Overall, I found ""Young and Innocent"" to be the best of early Hitchcock films I have sampled thus far.  I had never even heard of this one before.  I urge you to give it a look.  Highly recommended!",1433376000,,2931,4.686888454011742
