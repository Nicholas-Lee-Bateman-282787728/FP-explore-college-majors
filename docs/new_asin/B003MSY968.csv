4155774,4,B003MSY968,"COME UNDONE ('Cosa voglio di pi&ugrave;', the Italian title means 'What More Do I Want') is a very slight film by the well respected director Silvio Soldini ('Bread and Tulips', 'Days and Clouds', etc), a story that seems to get mired in its own passion, unable to transmit a story line that will keep the audience's attention. Perhaps this is due to the 'too many cooks spoil the broth' concept: in addition to Soldini the story and screenplay were nursed by Doriana Leondeff, and Angelo Carbone. The cast is a strong one but the actors are just not given much to develop, leaving the audience with the repeated question 'what if...?'

Anna (Alba Rohrwacher) is an accountant for an important insurance firm and lives with her longterm lover Alessio (Giuseppe Battiston) - a man who longs fro a stable longterm relationship with children, a home, etc.  Anna, feeling as though the fire has fizzled in that relationship and takes up with co-worker Domenico (Pierfrancesco Favino) and the two begin a passionate affair. Now it is Anna who is considering a longterm relationship but is thwarted by the fact that Domenico is married to Miriam (Teresa Saponangelo) and has children and doesn't want to leave his wife, instead preferring passionate occasional intervals  with Anna in tacky motels.  It becomes a struggle of human nature - which is preferable, a stable home life or intermittent moments of passion?

The actors give this film their all and the encounters between Anna  and Domenico are incredibly sensuous.  The problem lies with the story's lack of resolution or even momentum: it gets stuck in the process of offering a solution for the lovers. It is simply not up to the same standards as Soldini's other works - but those are fairly high standards to reach.  Given the film's few flaws it is still a beautiful visual experience.

It's a typical  European film that depicts real life. ...And as so many times in European movies,  the ending leaves you feeling uneasy and disturbed,  very different from Hollywood movies..  makes you THINK. ..  the moral of the story is adultery complicates lives. ..  make your decision in current relationship first. .  To stay or to go,  and if go. only then jump into something else. .. otherwise it will eventually leave everyone involved very hurt. ...",1497571200,,508,4.882352941176471

This is a very, very realistic Italian movie about two married people from low-middle/working class backgrounds who become involved in a love affair.

The affair brings some excitement and purpose to their otherwise dreary lives, which unfold in the high-rise peripheries of Milan among cement, shopping malls, and cars (outdoors) and screaming babies, TVs rambling, and appliance repairs (indoors).

But the affair is costly, emotionally and financially. They can only meet once a week in a squalid motel which they can barely afford, must tell a bunch of lies to their spouses, coworkers, and friends, are forced forego their few hobbies to carve a few hours for each other out of their cramped schedules, and generally are rather miserable.

In the end they break up. What else could they do?",1414022400,13,812,5.082706766917293

I suppose this takes a fairly honest look at how they cling to something different and new to avoid thinking about their own lack of passion and spontenaety.

There was one funny part of the movie.  At one point when the female star is somewhere in Arabia with her lover, she is offered earrings that match the color of her eyes.

The lovemaking scenes of course were passionate and intense depicting the attraction that to me was very believeable. What I liked about the direction this movie took was about family. Anna's family cared about her emotions. They seemed to key in on what she was experiencing without Anna having to say anything including her co-workers. I didn't quite understand the character of her boyfriend. I think his character didn't fit her but perhaps that is why she was exploring another relationship. I think what I liked most about this movie is how real the setting was. The home life of both of them, their work environment and the reality of how one deals with infidelity. Anna was much more complex. She seemed to fret about the whole ordeal. I think they both loved each other in the end but as in most affairs, one gets hurt. The earrings at the end was a key moment in the movie that let the audience know what was about to happen. Very well played and I recommend this movie highly. Still trying to find the beautiful music played especially the song they danced to. Sounded like flamenco.",1336780800,2,1172,4.6124401913875595
4156211,1,B003MSY968,"Some things make me weary: like couples who opt for a quickie, then decide they've ""never felt like this before,"" and proceed to create chaos and heartbreak, all to no avail. These lovers aren't even particularly attractive: He needs a shower and a shave, while she needs to wash off her raccoon eyes.

This in a nutshell, is the plot for this European entry to the 2010 Seattle International Film Festival. I realize that the director and the actors are striving to give their audience Italian/Swiss Porno-Lite, but after the twentieth stroke, gasp and clutch, I was longing for my remote.

4156214,5,B003MSY968,"After being totally wowed by ""Agata and the Storm"" and ""Days and Clouds,"" Soldini's latest film did not disappoint.  Like his other movies, ""Come Undone"" explores a relationship.  Here, we see apathetic Anna (played by Alba Rohrwacher) and charming Domenico (Pierfrancesco Favino) have an affair, despite both being in committed relationships - Domenico even has children.  Anna's life was perfectly fine before with a tragically caring and sweet-hearted man, Alessio (played clueless but kind by Giuseppe Battiston), and a stable lifestyle.  Of course, though, too much of a good life becomes boring and she is thus led into her relationship with Domenico after a chance meeting.  They have an irresistible attraction, to be sure.  Rohrwacher and Favino are magnificent together; the sexual attraction is palpable and practically jumping off the screen.

""Come Undone"" could have been just like any other movie about the affair but Soldini and his co-screenwriters, Doriana Leondeff and Angelo Carbone, made it different by choosing to focus on the daily aspects of life.  Rather than giving great importance to big events and happenings, ""Come Undone"" instead looks at the time that make up the majority of a lifetime: regular days.  We see how the affair takes a toll on these days as well as the lives of Alessio, Domenico's wife Miriam (Teresa Saponangelo) and their kids, as well some of Anna and Domenico's family and friends.  ""Come Undone"" takes into account the practical and prudent aspects of having an affair: where and when to meet, how to communicate, and, most importantly, how to fund the affair.  This different perspective on an old story is what makes Soldini's newest movie so fascinating.  That the actors convey real people and really make us care for them - no matter how immoral they may be - is a lucky and happy addition to an overall moving film.",1307577600,43,1874,5.048701298701299

4156216,4,B003MSY968,"I have been a fan of Film Movement, which releases foreign and indie films at a regular clip (once a month), and recently picked up this one. Didn't know much about the movie beforehand, on purpose, as I like to be surprised (good or bad).

""Come Undone"" (124 min; originally released in 2010) is an excellent Italian movie, exploring the effects of an extra-marital affair between two unlikely protagonists. Anna is in a stable relationship with her live-in boyfriend, surrounded by a caring family and having a good career. She meets Domenico, who himself is married with 2 kids. Yet they find themselves unstoppably attracked to each other and start an affair. They are both trying to cover up as much as possible, but eventually they have to face the fork in the road: continue this or call it quits? I'm not going to tell you how it plays out, you'll just have to watch it for yourself.

The movie moves at a slow pace, and I mean this as a compliment, and the lead actors shine throughout. Beware: there are a number of nudity scenes in the movie, if that is a problem for anyone. This is another great release from the Film Movement library, and I encourage you to seek them out. Meanwhile, ""Come Undone"" is highly recommended!",1300147200,49,1234,4.6045454545454545

8400477,3,B003MSY968,"I read through other reviews, and it occurs to me that your understanding and appreciation of the subject matter is likely directly related to your maturity and length of life (and marriage) experience.  So - having been in a 20 year marriage where I was cheated on, I could appreciate the story. The performances are very nice. The viewer feels torn between feeling for the loneliness of each character within their own rather tedious lives and marriages, but annoyed at their selfishness and stupidity in the end. It's really not a story about an affair, as much as it's about two empty marriages. It's well-done, overall.",1512691200,2,624,4.886792452830188
