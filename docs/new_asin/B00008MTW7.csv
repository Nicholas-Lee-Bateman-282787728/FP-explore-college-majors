1853437,2,B00008MTW7,"Poor John Wayne movie. The action sequences aren't well done- For instance when bandits strike Rock Hudson's group. Not one southerner is shot alone killed- And the romance between an Indian young man and Hudson's daughter is far fetched, and the deal Wayne and Hudson strike with a Mexican general unbelievable in light of what forced the agreement to be made.. Dub Taylor is amusing, Ben Johnson gives a solid performance, and film doesn't. The Undefeated isn't a good movie.",1512172800,,477,4.975

1853468,4,B00008MTW7,"This is a 1969 John Wayne western.  There is a good deal of action, good natured brawling, some light love interests, etc...  It is enjoyable and in many ways a typical John Wayne western from the 1960s.  It is directed by Andrew McLaglan.  Andrew McLaglan is the son of long time John Wayne associate and co star, Victor McLaglen.  Rock Hudson co stars.  Also appearing in the movie are two noteworthy NFL football players, Roman Gabriel and Merlon Olsen.

John Wayne worked with various actors over and over again in a sort of stock ensemble.  Appearing in this movie are Bruce Cabot, Ben Johnson, Edward Faulkner and Harry Carey Jr.  John Wayne showed a lot of loyalty to numerous actors who appeared with him over and over.  It is an enjoyable, uncomplicated, viewing experience.  It was made and released the same year as ""True Grit"" and does suffer by comparison.  Thank You...",1489968000,,883,4.7368421052631575

My grandfather would take us to the places where these movies were being filmed.  Have never seen Rock Hudson in any movie.
I think he and Wayne were great together, as I recall, Wayne had fallen and broke some ribs during that filming.
So many memories of the Hollywood sign.  It used to say HOLLYWOOD LAND, in 1950, the LAND fell and it was never put back up.
It was originally put as advertising to sell real estate.",1475366400,,576,4.256880733944954

1853568,3,B00008MTW7,"John Wayne is a union colonel in this film who hears that the Civil War has ended. He gathers his men to go west to grab wild horses and sell them to the US government. He collects 3,000. But the US only wants some of them and is only willing to pay a low price so Wayne sells them to the Mexican government.
Rock Hudson is a Confederate colonel who refuses to surrender. He takes his family and men and travels to Mexico where the government said it would welcome him.
Wayne and Hudson meet on the trail and like each other.
There are several battles during the trip, including fighting against renegades and Mexicans
There is a double cross in the film, two love affairs, and a surprise ending.
The film got a G rating and this is all it deserves.",1470355200,,749,4.28169014084507

1853604,4,B00008MTW7,"The Civil War is over but Colonel John Henry Thomas (John Wayne) fights on, decimating a company of Confederate soldiers three days and many corpses after their surrender.  Theyre stubborn, they say, it isn't over until they say its over.  But for Colonel James Langdon (Rock Hudson), late of the Confederacy, he has other plans; he leads a force of his former soldiers south to join Emperor Maximilian and his vain attempt to invade Mexico.  Why?  What else is there to do, he burned his plantation to the ground, theres no home to go back to.  Meanwhile, Colonel Thomas is driving a herd of horses to Durango because the snooty army refused to give him a fair price for them.  Naturally, the two Colonels cross paths, they make merry, and no one lives happily ever after because of the weirdest ending ever devised (truly, its a never mind moment that makes no dramatic sense whatsoever).  I was surprised when they didn't ride off into the sunset singing Que Sera, Sera.

Other than that, it had the requisite amount of action, humor, and a slight romance between Roman Gabriel (as Blue Boy) and Melissa Newman (as Charlotte Langdon).  Even so, by any measure, this is one of John Waynes lesser efforts.",1466294400,,1206,4.704761904761905

Short narrative, the War Between the States is over, The Duke and his men fought for the North and now have decided to go into business by rounding up wild horse and selling them to the US Calvary. Rock Hudson is a Confederate soldier who's lost everything but still believes in the South, and anyone who knows the true reason the war was fought will understand his reason for leaving and going to Mexico where a promise of land and their way of life can continue in peace. Of course the two groups meet and yes there is fighting but something that is expected more than wanted. And while it doesn't make them friends, neither are they enemies. But the Colonel will be betrayed as he and his group are captured and only the Duke and his men can save them.....but will they? Really good movie",1453766400,,941,4.262569832402234

of his former command and friends set out to carve a new beginning.
Meanwhile 'Confederate' Officer 'James Logan'(Hudson) is heading out with his
troopers and families to try and settle in Mexico.
Their paths destined to cross on Mexican soil, though on different sides of the
War divide they will find they need each other as they get caught between the
Mexican rebels and the Emperors army.
With a couple of good action sequences coupled with an element of humour Hollywood
legends 'John Wayne' and 'Rock Hudson' head the cast-list.
There are still one or two of 'John Wayne' in colour westerns yet to be released
onto the Blu-Ray format....'The Shootist' 'The son's of Katie Elder' and 'The
Alamo' among them.

1853819,4,B00008MTW7,"""The Undefeated"" (1969) teams up John Wayne and Rock Hudson as ex-Union and Confederate officers after the Civil War in Mexico. Langdon (Hudson) wants to relocate his family & friends whereas Thomas (Wayne) wants to make money selling horses to Emperor Maximilian. The problem is that Benito Juarez and his followers are at war with Maximilian and this causes unforeseen problems for the Americans, who have no choice but to team-up.

The set-up of story is great and loosely based on Joseph Orville ""Jo"" Shelby and his Missouri raiders and their families who really did seek to relocate to Maximilian's Mexico, but had to return after the victory of Juarez' forces. The movie starts with a Civil War battle and the announcement that Lee has surrendered and the war is over, which segues into Langdon and Thomas and their people going to Mexico for completely different reasons; and then they meet. This is great, but the filmmakers add some goofiness, like an over-the-top, fun-spirited brawl between the Confederates and Federals at a 4th of July party in the wilderness. These types of scenes were fairly common in Wayne Westerns at the time and I always thought they detracted from these movies. There's a way to mix realistic comedy into a movie and a way not to and this isn't the way. Besides, how can a serious brouhaha be fun? When you punch people in the face in real life they get bloody noses and missing teeth; here they just laugh it off.

Another problem is NFL quarterback Roman Gabriel as a full-blooded Native American and adopted son of Thomas. No matter how you slice it, he looks like a white dude with a mop of black hair. To add insult to injury, Langdon's cute daughter (Melissa Newman) falls head-over-heals in love with him and the way it happens simply isn't realistic. Would a genuine Southern belle really swoon over a full-blooded Indian who visits their encampment? Would no one notice that the two have wandered off to make-out, in plain view of the others? Would Col. Langdon really not mind that his daughter is sucking face with a full-blooded Native? In our day and age it's no big deal and most people could care less, but it's still an issue in some circles; how much more so back then, particularly with a proud Southern Colonel and his people?

If you can overlook these flaws, however, this is a very worthwhile Western with quality drama, action, characters and locations (shot in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Durango, Mexico). The cast is also notable. Besides the two stars, you also get Lee Meriwether, Marian McCargo, Jan-Michael Vincent (in a too-small role), Merlin Olsen, Ben Johnson and various Wayne Western staples.

This is a likable Western because the people are so likable. For instance, the way one group is unselfishly willing to let go of something of great worth on behalf of another group blows the mind, but it reveals their nobility and the fact that they value human beings more than they do monetary gain, but only because they've found them worthy. It also reveals respect and the willingness to forgive & heal after the nation's most bloody war.

The film runs 119 minutes.

1853852,3,B00008MTW7,"I found this 1969 western, distantly inspired by real events, watchable, but less good than most of John Wayne films. It certainly has its moments, but the weakness of scenario becomes with time embarrassing. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

1. The real story of general ""Jo"" Shelby and ""The Undefeated"".

Before the War Between States, Joseph Orville ""Jo"" Shelby (1830-1897) was one of wealthiest landowners and most successful businessmen in the South. Born in a rich family, he lost his father at the age of 5 and was raised by his stepfather. Once of age, he quickly increased family's wealth by clever and daring investments and at the age of 31 he owned propriety (including a large number of slaves) and businesses all around Kentucky and Missouri.

In 1855, long before the War Between States began, young ""Jo"" Shelby became involved in the ""Bleeding Kansas"" armed fight between Northern anti-slavery militants and their Southern slave owners opponents. He raised a Southern militia squadron with his own money and rode at the head of it - it cost him a lot, as in retaliation pro-Northern radicals burned some of his businesses in Missouri. In 1857 he married young Elizabeth Nancy Shelby, a relative.

In 1861 the state of Missouri, even if it ultimately didn't join the Confederacy, was almost evenly divided between pro-South and pro-North partisans. With his own money Shelby raised a company of volunteer cavalry with himself as its commanding officer with the rank of captain. The war in Missouri turned badly for the Confederates who were ultimately forced to retire to Arkansas, but many thousands local volunteers followed them there. In 1862 Shelby, having proved himself on the battlefield, was promoted to full colonel and took over a regiment of Missouri volunteers fighting in Arkansas. Later that year, with more Missouri volunteers arriving, his command expanded to a cavalry brigade - it quickly earned quite a reputation and became known as ""Iron Brigade"".

Between 22 September and 3 November 1863, Shelby led his Iron Brigade of Missouri volunteers on what was to be the longest cavalry raid of the war at that time, and is since known as Shelby's Great Raid. With his 800 men, twelve wagons and two light field guns, he rode 1,500 miles through Missouri, inflicting over 1,000 casualties on Northern forces, and capturing or destroying an estimated $2 million worth of Federal supplies and property. This raid took place after many defeats suffered by the CSA and therefore was a welcome morale for Confederate soldiers - it also dragged a lot of Union troops away from the main front. After the successful conclusion of the raid Shelby was  promoted to brigadier-general on December 15, 1863 and was celebrated as a popular war hero in the South, but in the same time he became also an object of much hatred amongst Northern politicians and generals - and they were not going to forget or forgive him...

In 1864 and 1865 his Iron Brigade accomplished more exploits, but their detailed description would take too much place. Anybody interested in reading about Shelby and his men can try one of the many books devoted to this topic - my personal recommendation would be ""General Jo Shelby: undefeated rebel"" by Daniel O'Flaherty.

In June 1865, once Confederation was destroyed by invading Northern armies, Shelby and 1000 of his men refused to surrender and instead rode to Mexico, intending to become a mercenary foreign legion in service of embattled Emperor Maximilian. Before joining with Maximilian forces, they had to fight their way through Benito Juarez troops and local bandits.

The ruler of Mexico was at that time losing the war against the forces of Juarez and was initially thrilled to welcome reinforcements of such battle hardened veterans - however strong diplomatic pressure from US government forced him to decline the offer. On another hand he refused to disarm or expel Shelby's men and instead granted them and their families abandoned land near Veracruz, to become civilian settlers and form a Southern exiles colony. However, in 1867, once Maximilian was defeated and executed, victorious Benito Juarez, bowing to renewed pressures of US government, expelled Shelby and his men and confiscated their propriety. Arriving on the border Shelby threw the flag of his brigade in the waters of Rio Grande, so no Yankee hand ever touches it...

Although granted amnesty by US government, Shelby and his men returned in 1867 to Missouri penniless and in rags - but still undefeated... Starting from nothing, they went into farming and other kinds of trades and with business skills of their former commander and a lot of hard work they quickly rebuild their lives and took active part in retaking the destinies of their native state from post war carpetbagger/scalawag abusive administration. Shelby became soon once again a wealthy farmer and businessman and he did a lot to help former Confederate soldiers - as well as the last Southern partisans, like Frank James (he witnessed for defense at his trial in 1883, helping him avoid death penalty). Still very popular amongst his fellow Missourians, he secured an appointment as US Marshal for west Missouri in 1893, helping to eliminate last Wild West bandits from this territory. He died in 1897 surrounded by children and grand children, as a rich man, an important local political figure, a widely known folk hero - and still ""Undefeated"".

2. The film

After the end of War Between States, northern cavalry Colonel John Henry Thomas (John Wayne) leaves the army and with a group of survivors of his command goes to southern Texas. Their plan is  to capture mustangs, with intention of selling them to US Army. However, once this deal doesn't pan out, they accept an offer from the representatives of emperor Maximilian of Mexico and go south to bring 3000 wild horses to Durango. On their way there, much to their surprise, they find a convoy of former Confederate soldiers under Colonel James Langdon (Rock Hudson), who, together with their families, travel to join Maximilian army. Those groups will have then some considerable interaction, one with another and also with some Indians, Juaristas, bandidos and French cavalry from imperial army...

This film was made in 1969, soon after Duke finished ""True grit"". It was directed by Andrew V. McLaglen, an experienced director who in the past made some really good movies (""Shenandoah"", ""The way west"") and was going later to make the very brutal ""Last hard men"" and especially the legendary ""Wild geese"", the best film about modern mercenaries made until now. Son of Duke's old pal and partner (and great actor in his own rights), Victor McLaglen, he already worked with John Wayne on ""McLintock"" and ""Hellfighters"" - they were going later to make two more films, ""Chisum"" and ""Cahill, US Marshall"".

Other than John Wayne and Rock Hudson, some veteran actors were cast in this film, like Ben Johnson, who plays Short Grub, an old friend of John Henry Thomas, comic and western actor Dub Taylor, who plays the cantankerous Yankee cook and also Bruce Cabot (who in 1933 played Jack Driscoll in ""King Kong"") and Harry Carey, Jr., a veteran of John  Ford westerns. Some young talent was added, with Jan Michael Vincent, who plays a young Confederate lieutenant, as well as some more unusual performers - two huuuuuge professional football players, Roman Gabriel, who plays Blue Boy, a Cherokee Indian and John Henry Thomas adopted son as well as Merlin Olsen, who plays the Confederate soldier Little George, a gentle giant and blacksmith by trade in more peaceful times.

3. Good points

The introduction scenes of the film, from which the title of the review is taken, are REALLY good and the scenes in which the ""Undefeated"" say goodbye to their land and propriety and leave to Mexico are also VERY good. At that moment, colonel Langdon seems to be really a character as strong and impressive as general ""Jo"" Shelby.

John Wayne plays here his usual character and he is of course a pleasure to watch as always, as he dispenses smart one-liners and common sense speeches, punches people who need punching and shoots people who need killing.

There are also two attractive, available and not-unwilling ladies, Ann  Langdon, played by Marian McCargo (who soon after married and retired from acting) and young Charlotte Langdon, played by Melissa Newman, a young debutante, cute like a button but whose career never really took off.

There is some nice humor, some of it centered around the nasty, incompetent Yankee cook, Mr McCartney and his mangy cat, inappropriately named High Bred. Most of moments with the gentle giant Little George are fun too - the guy is so huge that he ""outnumbers any opponent""... The monumental 4th of July fistfight between ""Yanks"" and ""Rebs"" is also a nice moment of cinema.

4. Weaker points.

The Confederates, although shown initially as strong, proud warriors, are quickly turned into a completely hapless outfit, more and more lost, more and more incompetent and more and more desperate. The fact that, instead of Shelby's powerful ""Iron Brigade"" the whole Confederate expedition counts a rather pathetic 40 soldiers, 50 civilians and 18 wagons, doesn't help. The character of James Langdon, which begins the film as a powerful warrior, keeps getting pussified with every minute of the film, until his total castration.

Other than the short martial introduction this film contains only two action scenes and if one is acceptable, the other (a fight against French Cavalry) must be amongst the most laughable combat sequences I ever saw.

This film tried desperately to show that former bitter enemies can lay aside their differences and reconcile - and this effort was made with all the subtlety a sledgehammer carrying gentle giant is capable of...))) No, seriously, in fact here the kumbaya is violently forced into our throats without any mercy and therefore this film by moments is actually quite embarrassing... Me for one, I absolutely refuse to believe that a proud Southern belle, who lost her beloved husband of many years at war and is still devastated by her loss, falls immediately for the first enemy officer she can set her eyes on and that notwithstanding the fact that this guy actually WAS very much involved in the same battle in which her man was killed... The only guy who actually seems to have some resentment left (and we are supposed to be here in 1865 - very soon after the war ended) is of course a Confederate and he is of course shown as a totally lame, incompetent, bulling moron...

There is also the fact, that, in his desperate efforts to reconcile those two groups of people, the director decided to give them a common enemy - and as result we can actually understand, that blues and greys CAN forget hatred and war and reconcile in peace and love, AT THE CONDITION that they are (almost) all white and that they get some browns they can kill together...)))

I was also not fully happy with the only Indian character in the film, Blue Boy, who is a full blood Cherokee adopted by John Henry Thomas and therefore also a veteran of Northern cavalry. The reason of my unhappiness is the fact that if Cherokees indeed fought (and very bravely) in the War Between States, most of them actually did it on the side Confederation, as a great number of them owned slaves and didn't want to lose them... In fact the real ""Jo"" Shelby fought together with a great number of Cherokee Indians against Yankees at the battle of Pea Ridge in 1862 and in some further occasions too...

WARNING! SPOILER ALERT: so if the director really wanted to show an interracial romance between a hulking full blooded Indian and an underage daughter of a proud Southern aristocrat AND make it plausible, he had ample opportunity to make Blue Boy a young dashing Confederate officer and therefore Langdon's brother in arms - and that would be historically acurate as there were hundreds of Indian officers in Confederacy (including at least one general, Stand Watie). It would also make more plausible all the star crossed romance between Charlotte and Blue Boy - such a union certainly would not be enthusiastically accepted, but at least it would remain in the domain of remotely possible. But there is absolutely no way that an aristocratic proud Confederate colonel could have accepted his daughter marrying a low born full blooded Indian, who actually FOUGHT FOR THE YANKEES during the war!

Finally, I absolutely hated the ending of this film - the scene in which two honorable men (Thomas and Langdon) have a drink and shake hands with a hostage taker (who even threatened to kill women and children) and an enthusiastic mass murderer, simply disgusted me.

CONCLUSION: for all those reasons,  I cannot rate this film more than three stars. It actually is another proof that when you try to make a film with a heavy message and too much good intentions, you just get a not so good film. For John Wayne's greatest fans - otherwise not a necessary viewing.",1411948800,,13080,4.93406093678945

1853875,5,B00008MTW7,"Great story.  The two Rock and John Wayne are equal partners in this western.
Rock Hudson never looked so good.  A damn shame his life ended so soon.  This shows only a minuscule amount of his versatile dramatic potential.  I collect all of his unusual performances, in roles you wouldn't expect him to appear. Here he plays a gentile southern land owner whose way of life is threatened.  He is excellent.
John Wayne is more or less in the usual role of trail boss.  No dramatic intensity here, just his usual, for me Rock is the picture.",1406419200,,538,4.494845360824742

These two and their men team up to round up a herd of wild horses to sell to the Mexican Government.  Lots of bandits and Jauristas on the way to the final delivery.  Fun to watch and beautiful scenery.  Two football players, Roman Gabriel and Merlin Olsen make their debut.

John Wayne had friends and over the years made sure they got work.  That is why you see so many familiar in his movies.  We also get to see Merlin Olsen first big screen appearance and Roman Gabriel as an Indian son of John Wayne.  Rock Hudson is a Confederate Officer who needs to keep fighting once the war has ended and goes to Mexico, along with his former soldiers and families to fight for The French leader Maximilian. John Wayne and is Cowboys lead a bunch of Horses to sell to Maximilian. If you know history the french lost and left the country.

1853902,4,B00008MTW7,"There were some things I didn't like, but other things really stood out. If I could have watched the film with a few things in mind, I may have enjoyed it even more. Here's how you can really enjoy this film:
There are two stories here: A story about working with former enemies and a really dumb story about going to Mexico. If you can just ignore the idea of going to Mexico (especially why each group is going to Mexico--which is a very weak plot point) you can really enjoy the rest of it. Look for great performances by Wayne and Hudson. They like each other and work well with each other on screen. Look for the beautiful cinematography. Some delightful wide shots with great color. Great locations. Great camera angles. Finally some impressive scenes with hundreds of horses.
If they would have eliminated the clunky Mexico plot line, this would be a clear 5-star film. Unfortunately this plot line leads to an unsatisfying ending. But enjoy it anyway.",1397088000,,959,4.647058823529412

But pairing him with Rock Hudson works really well.  However, I must say the music score, and especially the main theme tune, are really lovely.  I was captivated by this music as a kid and to this day I'll pop my DVD in just to hear the soundtrack.  To me, music makes the movie.  If effective, music moves the story line along, and adds layers to the plot and character development.  All in all, I believe this is my favorite Wayne film.

Also this makes a great gift for a person who is collecting John Wayne's movies and already has most of them.

After all I am a movie addict :) After the Civil War ends opposing sides at one time,find themselves helping each other, even liking each other and mutual respect  develops even among those die hard Yankees and Rebels. I enjoy this very much repeatedly!!! I have found out also about John Wayne's attitude in real life from this movie that the Duke worked with Rock Hudson and it is this:When this film was made no one yet knew Rock Hudson was a Homosexual,(It wasnn't until the 1980s that this was revealed when he (Mr. Hudson) contracted Aids. However, Mr. Wayne knew about it and did not care because Mr. Wayne saw it as two proffesionals working together to make a movie.

Thomas resigns the Army as soon as the war is over, planning to go west with what's left of the men he commanded and round up some wild horses to sell to the U.S. Army. Langdon loads his family and what's left of his command into wagons and heads south to Mexico, figuring it's better to work for Emperor Maximilian than it is to suffer under the carpetbagging Yankees during reconstruction. He sets fire to his house and barn rather than let it fall into the hands of the crooks who came south to get rich off southern misery.

These two not only run into each other just the other side of the Rio Grande, they become allies against bandits and various misfortunes. I won't spell it out and ruin the story. But there has to be a romance, doesn't there. John Thomas has his adopted son with him, a full-blood Cherokee. Langdon has his beautiful blond daughter with him. Three guesses what happens there.

When they arrive at their intended destination, they find there has been a revolution, and their intended business with the Emperor will have to be adjusted accordingly. Of course, with brave men like Wayne and Hudson, everything works out eventually, right?

Well it took longer for one side to finally realize that which is the Rock Hudson's group of people but still wanting to have a better life just like John Wayne's group. So both groups felt ""Undefeated"" no matter what the aftermath happen in the movie.

Great scenery, alot of great character actors normally surrounded John Wayne throughout his acting career. One thing John Wayne did was make sure the character actors that you see over and over again in different movies HAD work. He took care of them and made them his extended family.

I rather watch these types of old classic films then watch what is coming out of Hollywood presently which is more violent, stupid and no acting and all special affects to cover up the bad acting. I really miss the old days of acting when there was true actors like in this film.

1853988,5,B00008MTW7,"My two favorite actors in a different, and interesting post-Civil-War south-Western, with the usual John Wayne players plus Roman Gabriel, who comes across as very attractive as Wayne's adopted Native American son, who falls for Hudson's teenage daughter and vice versa.
Among memorable lines:  Gabriel telling Wayne, ""She wants me.""
Hudson manages a southern accent tolerably well most of the time, and he wears the uniform -- especially the plumed hat -- with panache.  The segment where the southerners host the northerners to a 4th of July party displays Hudson's boyishness to an amazing degree, considering that he was, at the time, in his early 40s and not a stranger to hard drinking.
Some critics have questioned the plot, but all in all, it offers a view of Mexican history that is too often unknown or forgotten.
Lots of action scenes, including a wild-horse roundup, and the sine qua non for a John Wayne film:  the mass punch-em-out fight scene concluding with everybody battered but buddies -- including Wayne and Hudson who take a turn knocking each other down.
Another memorable line:  Hudson telling Wayne, ""If I can find the time, I'm gonna  sit down and write the social history of bourbon.""

A beautiful and magnificent score by Hugo Montenegro.

Trivia:  Supporting cast lists John Agar, but search as I might I couldn't pick him out.

This film holds up well under many re-viewings.  I would rank it as one of the best of the later Wayne films, and one of Hudson's most endearing.

1853990,4,B00008MTW7,"Boy, let me clear my eyes a minute and write about this movie.
 I saw it today on a day off in summer on a TV channel. It might be a good one if you were thinking of hosting a round-up. First the title tells us quite a bit. John Wayne plays a former Yankee Colonel who is selling a huge herd of horses to Maximillian for the bucks. Three thousand, with his band of former Union fighting loyal men and adopted son Blueboy a Cherokee footballer (Roman Gabriel looking very handsome). Yes, initially what pulled me into the movie was Wayne calling this brave his adopted son and naming him Blueboy, that and my spending an hour trying to place him. It isn't terribly honorable to deal with Maximilian but they are tired of having nothing but war and pain I think.

 On the way to Mexico to collect their cash for horses they are ambushed by a troop of bandits after meeting a Confederate troop that have suffered the loss of the war, this Confederate family and soldier band going to Maximilian now I guess for a new start? Unable to stay in America?  This group includes Rock Hudson, his wife Mederidith Baxter, his daughter and he's playing a Colonel too. He and Wayne were fun to watch.

 That made me think of the movie title because in a way both groups are dealing with defeat. Hudson's group unable to accept it, Wayne's feeling the sting of a way different kind of defeat. They've lost friends, fought, got nothing to show for it and are darn tired. So in this money racked horse deal they kind of have to work together fending off the bandits, then a big and rather stressing meeting up with Benito Juarez Mexican independence revolutionaries aiming to get those horses. They take the entire Conferate group for ransom and wayne and men give away the horses to save them ultimately. Talk about reconciliation!

 Along the way each man, Wayne and Hudson reveal their honor. Their ability to accept defeat, to work together to save the families, to see the things they will fight for, it's pretty classic stuff. Blueboy is Wayne's adopted son, a real man of honor that gets wrapped up in his wanting the Southern Colonel's daughter. Wayne gets a love interest too in the form of the sister in law to this southern Colonel mourning her loses of her man killed at a Civil war battle Wayne has been involved in on the other side. It's really a movie about all of that -one side against another and how perspectives and situations frame who we are, what we do.

Yes, I cried. I got afraid it wasn't going to go well at the end and the scenes of execution got to me. As the dastardly freedom fighter says, ""War is war.""
And everyone is looking at the defeated and the notions of winning.",1249257600,,2686,4.443089430894309

1853992,1,B00008MTW7,"I've seen this film several times and I always find it disturbing because it strikes me as classic Hollywood in that though the Civil War is central to the film, at no point is slavery ever mentioned.  Which is to say that the film turns on the reconciliation of North and South and their mutual interests, which come to the fore as they are fighting Mexicans.  Though I must say that the scene with Wayne and Hudson swigging bourbon as they recount the war is entertaining, ultimately, the film's unwillingness to explore the nature of their difference--which could be their differing notions of whether people should be property (albeit John Wayne's films generally portray his relations with people of color as paternalistic at best), is left unexplored, as if the Civil War was some kind of minor family squabble that requires whites rediscovering their mutual interests to overcome.  It could be that this is a film about honor, but it feels more to me like the usual Hollywood distortion of history.",1225497600,,1005,4.8654970760233915
1853993,5,B00008MTW7,"""The Undefeated"" (Nov. 1969) was completely overshadowed by ""True Grit"" (June 1969).  There is no way Col. John Henry Thomas can compete with Rooster Cogburn.  Some people fault this film and even Rock Hudson spoke ill of it.  However, I enjoyed watching more than I have enjoyed a great many modern movies.  Sure, the plot is kind of screwy.  I mean, how many Confederate military units moved their wives and kids to Mexico?  But people do crazy things after losing a war.  It may be hard to believe, but there were many in the South who regard that War Between the States as inconclusive and that the wrong side claimed victory.  You do not have to look very hard to find whole groups of these people on the Internet today.  So, the movie is kind of topical in that way.

So, the movie has one band of Confederates led by Rock Hudson (Col. James Langdon) headed towards Mexico under the protection of Emperor Maximilian.  The other party is led by John Wayne (Col. John Henry Thomas) who has just retired from the military and wants to sell 3,000 wild horses to the U.S. Army to get money for his men to split as a final payday before they all head home.  Of course, the groups become aware of each other and the plot twists involve how the groups of Yanks and Rebs interact.  To make things more complicated there are Mexicans who want those horses, too.

There are many familiar faces in the film that make it a lot more fun: Harry Carey, Jr., Ben Johnson, Paul Fix, and others such as Dub Taylor.  The movie also reflects its time by casting two famous football players.  The L.A. Rams quarterback plays Wayne's adopted Indian son, Blue Boy and the great L.A. Rams defensive lineman (and later spokesman for FTD florists) plays Cpl Little George in the Confederate band.  The female leads are all Confderate women.  The Lanford daughter, Charlotte, is played by Melissa Newman, and the older sisters (one is a widow and a semi love interest for Wayne), are played by Lee Meriwether and Marian McCargo.

There are a variety of twists and turns and questions about the ideas about good guys and bad guys rotates around Wayne and his band throughout the movie.

Not great, but certainly enjoyable.

1854016,5,B00008MTW7,"In the late sixties, the Western Genre experienced a visible twist of fate, due several conjugated factors, the surrounding socio- political reality and the presence of four notable directors who lived outdoors with a personal approach about this genre:  Sam Peckinpah, who literally inspired direct and indirectly to many others filmmakers. Beware of two fundamental samplers: When a director of the artistic punch of Artur Penn decided to make Little big man"", Sergio Leone and his ""Once upon a time in the West""and then Andrew McLaglen with ""The undefeated"" curiously Peckinpah was filming in the same year, that the classic cult movie: ""The wild bunch"", the intention was clearly obvious; The western had to come out from its inner reality; Indians against the good guys was literally exhausted and they had to search new sources of inspiration. You may realize other four emblematic Westerns that definitively were on the other side of the accustomed frontier: ""The lives and times of judge Roy Bean"" of John Huston, ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid"" and Richard Brooks'  ""Bite the bullet."" Moreover, there is one point I want you to realize:  Edward Dmytryk, (Warlock, 1959), Anthony Mann (The man in the west and The naked spur) Huston, Brooks, Sam Fuller (The broken arrow),  were besides, remarkable directors in the Noir genre, which carves in relief the Western was still alive and enjoyed of good health.

And the occasion was propitious to take a look around the Mexican reality with Benito Juarez , joining an outlaw (John Wayne) who decides to sell guns and rifles, and his enemy Rock Hudson as a Confederate Officer, who by these destiny trickeries will join forces to carve in relief the patriotism was beyond any other ethic difference.

1854043,4,B00008MTW7,"I have fond memories of this 1969 film because of the way that I first happened to see it.  When my father was stationed in Japan we would have the opportunity every couple of months to go see a late show at the base theater.  The movie to be screened was never announced; you just went and took your chances.  One time it was ""One More Time"" (Peter Lawford plays Lord Sydney Pepper and Sammy Davis, Jr. was Charlie Salt) and another time it was ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" (I guessed the movie on the basis of the opening shot of the waves coming ashore).  One night we went and the movie starts off with a bunch of Confederate soldiers waiting for attack and then along comes John Wayne leading a Union cavalry charge and we got to see ""The Undefeated"" weeks before its normal rotation to our theater.

Actually, John Wayne is not the best part of this film.  The opening scenes deal with the end of the Civil War.  Wayne plays Colonel John Henry Thomas, whose men have followed him from Texas to fight for the Union and are not sick of soldiering and ready to go home.  The plan is that they are going to put together a herd of wild horses and sell them to representatives of the Mexican government, who are offering the best price.  Of course, Mexico might be about to have its own Civil War.  Meanwhile, the defeat of the Confederacy and the arrival of Northern carpetbaggers have convinced Colonel James Langdon (Rock Hudson) and his men that there is nothing left for them in the South.  So his plan is to lead his men and their families to Mexico to serve in the military for the government of the Emperor Maximillian trying to hold onto power.

The two groups of former enemies meet along the way and after fighting Indians together achieve something of a rapprochement, mainly because Rock and the Duke are manly men and hit it off.  They two big stars acting together, with Rock upstaging an amiable Duke at just about every opportunity.  The idea of what expatriate Confederates during after the Civil War is an interesting one, but the script only deals with that as a means of setting up the rest of the film.

Of course since the former Confederates are traveling with women and the ex-Union soldiers only brought horses, the romantic subplots involve overlooking the minor past differences of the war that killed a half million Americans.  Colonel Langdon's sister-in-law (Marian McCargo) grudgingly sparks to John Henry, despite the fact his unit was as Shiloh where her husband was killed.  But it is hard to pay attention to any notion of a mature relationship when young Charlotte Langdon (Melissa Newman), the Colonel's daughter takes an interest in Blue Boy (L.A. Rams quarterback Roman Gabriel), John Henry's Cherokee Indian adopted son, which does not sit well with her beau, Lt. Bubba Wilkes (Michael Vincent before he was Jan-Michael Vincent, and I swear I did not make up that ""Bubba"" name).

Another NFL player, a then relatively unknown Merlin Olsen, plays Corporal Little George, a gentle giant for gets to fight for the honor of the Confederacy from time to time.  You will also see former Miss America Lee Meriwether as Colonel Langdon's wife along with veteran character actors Ben Johnson as Short Grub, Harry Carey, Jr. as on of Thomas' riders, and Royal Dano as a dignified Confederate officer.

This is really a 3.5 star movie.  It is not as good as I remember and there are all sorts of problematic elements to the film simply because ""The Undefeated"" is pretty much doing things by the numbers.  There are no big surprises here once you know the players and it is simply a question of watching it all play out.  In the end I round up simply because of the scenes between Wayne and Hudson, and that is without getting into the fascinating sub-text of the personification of American machismo acting opposite the biggest Hollywood star in the closet.  I have seen some evidence that the Duke knew about Rock's secret, but there is nothing in the film to suggest it bothered him.",1088380800,,4020,4.637517630465444

If you're into western soundtracks, you probably already have seen this movie, but if not, don't miss the marvelous work done with the trombone sections.
The movie is entertaining, and with a great deal of humor.

McLaglen (the director of this rubbish) and Burt Kennedy (a contemporary who churned out equally worthless films) managed to kill the western genre during the late 1960s through the mid 1970s. These guys honestly make Kevin Costner westerns seem like masterpieces. THE UNDEFEATED typifies their magic formula of big name stars, no script, gunfights every 27 minutes, a blaring soundtrack, a little bit of slapstick, and a lot of bad acting. Add a touch of young love and NFL players who want to be actors and voila -- you have a memorable cinematic experience like THE UNDEFEATED!
The only people who will find this entertaining are John Wayne fans -- who will have their loyalty to the screen legend tested by this film -- and those who still argue for the nobility of the Confederacy. This latter group are probably heartbroken at the film's ending when Rock Hudson and company are not successful in establishing a Confederate haven in Mexico from which they can continue to fight for the valiant cause of the South. Alas. Rock Hudson as Colonel James Langdon embodies the prototypical Confederate hero who loves his slaves, loves the South even more, is a proper gentleman, and will burn his plantation estate before he lets Yankee carpetbaggers get their hands on his Eden. Bravo! Perhaps my favorite scene is when Rock gives one of his older slaves his daddy's gold watch. The poignancy is overwhelming. I guess the message is: I'll give you this priceless antique before I give you your freedom.
Even without this Southern revisionist crap, THE UNDEFEATED would be awful. The only reason it gets one star is that John Wayne's sideburns in this film absolutely rock. In fact, I would have been much more entertained by a film about the Duke's sideburns and Rock Hudson's mustache. Maybe Andrew V. McLaglen will use that idea for a directorial comeback vehicle!!! We can only hope.",1077235200,,1895,4.888198757763975
1854047,1,B00008MTW7,dont waste an hour or two on this clunker. this movie has good actors like Rock Hudson and John Wayne among others but don't be fooled by them it is simply one of their worst films so don't be fooled and don't waste a good hour or two.,1071187200,,235,3.9166666666666665
1854048,4,B00008MTW7,"The Undefeated is an excellent western that teams John Wayne and Rock Hudson together for the first time.  Set in the months after the Civil War, the story follows two groups as they venture into Mexico.  One group led by Wayne's Colonel John Henry Thomas is driving 3,000 horses south to deliver to the forces of the French emperor, Maximillian.  The other group is a wagon train of Confederate soldiers and their families who are moving to Mexico City under Maximillian's rule.  Along the way, the two groups meet up and battle bandits, Juaristas, and even themselves.  The action scenes are very well put together, especially the 4th of July fistfight and the bandit attack on the wagon train.
  John Wayne and Rock Hudson are great as two rival leaders, one Union and one Confederate, who must work together if they are to survive in Mexico.  Their relationship has several funny moments as they discuss their involvement during the war.  The Duke's crew includes Ben Johnson as Short Grub, Dub Taylor as Mr. McCartney, Roman Gabriel as Blue Boy, and several other Duke regulars.  The rest of the impressive cast includes Tony Aguilar, Bruce Cabot, Merlin Olsen, Edward Faulkner, Harry Carey JR, Marian McCargo, Lee Meriwether, Melissa Newman, and Big John Hamilton. It was great to see this on DVD which offers widescreen presentation, several theatrical trailers including The Comancheros and North to Alaska as well as two in Spanish and Portuguese.  In the trailer, look for a scene of Blue Boy's fellow riders capturing Rock Hudson as he rides to Wayne's camp that did not make it to the final copy.  This is an excellent post Civil War western that all Duke fans will love!  Do not miss!",1057449600,,1697,4.83044982698962
1854049,4,B00008MTW7,"In this film Wayne, as former Union Colonel John Henry Thomas, and Hudson, as former Confederate Colonel James Langdon, re-enact on a small scale the slow and painful psychological healing and reunion of the divided nation following the Civil War.  Thomas and the remnants of his unit (including the ever-delightful Ben Johnson as Short Grub and Roman Gabriel somewhat less than sterling as Thomas's Cherokee adopted son, Blue Boy) return to the West to hunt wild horses for a living, while Langdon and his, unwilling to submit to the indignities of Yankee occupation and carpetbagger rule, burn their homes, pack up their families, and head for Mexico, where they hope to join the French Interventionists (a plan historically followed, though without the noncombatants, by General Jo Shelby).  Somewhere in Northern Mexico the two groups meet, and after some mutual suspicion become uneasy allies to beat off a gang of bandidos.  When Langdon's company unwittingly blunders into a trap set by the Juaristas, Thomas and his men agree to surrender their catch of horses as ransom.  Much of the charm of the film arises from the head-butting of the two veteran commanders (particularly the sequence in which Hudson utters his memorable line, ""If I can find the *time* I'm gonna siddown and write the social history of Bourbon!""), which is, of course, echoed by their men (most notably the quiet rivalry of Short Grub and Robert Donner as Judd Mailer).  Yet Blue Boy is early attracted to Langdon's daughter (despite the presence of her long-time suitor, Jan-Michael Vincent as Bubba Wilkes), and even Thomas finds a kindred spirit in his rival's widowed sister-in-law.  A good movie about the aftermath of war and the healing of wounds.",1044403200,,1734,5.066666666666666
1854050,4,B00008MTW7,"Various factors combine to make this an enjoyable bit of action-adventure fluff. This applies both before and behind the camera. John Wayne worked very well with director Andrew McLaglen. For the record, the typical result was less artistic than Wayne's efforts with John Ford, Howard Hawks, etc. Wayne and McLaglen adeptly collaborated on an entertaining string of big budget B pictures. Much of the cast is from the Batjac production company players, and features Western stalwarts such as Ben Johnson and Dub Taylor. Then, of course, there is Rock Hudson. Hudson and Wayne both display enthusiasm and humor in their roles as former Civil War enemies that form an unlikely alliance. After the war ends, Wayne and his herders drive wild horses down to Mexico for profit. They find Hudson leading a group of ex-Confederates seeking to resettle around Durango. After fighting off an army of bandits, the Wayne and Hudson contingents are caught between Mexican revolutionary factions and they have to shoot their way out. This flick features an ample amount of shoot-'em-up violence that never gets more explicit than ""PG."" A highpoint is the hilarious drunken brawl at the Confederates' July 4 picnic. (Why die-hard Confederates want to celebrate July 4 is not explained). Colorful outdoor locations, a small-scale Civil War battle, and a romantic subplot rounds two hours of action-packed fun. Look for football stars Merlin Olsen and Roman Gabriel in supporting roles. Recommended viewing. ;-)",1040169600,,1494,5.2552301255230125
1854051,5,B00008MTW7,"This film takes place in a post Civil War setting, where every character finds it difficult to accept the terms of the end of that war.  A band of Southern Confederates would rather live/work in Mexico than under the influence of Yankees and Carpetbaggers.  The friendship between the Yankee horse trader (Wayne) and the Confererate leader (Hudson) leads to entertaining encounters, and life & death decisions when the Mexican revolution takes everyone by surprise.  This movie is representative of John Wayne's later works, and is a keeper.  But be warned, I think all of J. Wayne's films are keepers, and as such, my opinion is biased.",1025740800,,637,4.981132075471698
1854052,3,B00008MTW7,"I didn't really care for this movie the first time I saw it but as I watched it the second time I came to appreciate the great lines delivered by the Duke as only he can.  Not my favorite but it does have a  civil war battle intro, 3000 horse drive to mexico, the unavoidable mexican bandit trying to steal the horses, great outdoor scenery and the  obligatory John Wayne signature group brawl.

The VHS tape I have is the same cover as the one pictured and has a great making of documentary for the movie.  Why is this feature not on the DVD?!?!",963014400,,546,4.211538461538462
1854053,2,B00008MTW7,"Even the combined star-power of Rock Hudson and John Wayne can't save this tired rehash of far better similar westerns. The Yankee-in-Mexico plot has served as the basis for several classic westerns -- VERA CRUZ, THE  PROFESSIONALS, THE WILD BUNCH -- but this comes up woefully short. The  politics and conflicts are muddled to the point that it is hard to know  just which side you're supposed to be rooting for. The above cited classics  made it crystal-clear which side was in the right, even if it seemed the  Yankee heros weren't sure themselves. Steer wide of this, even if you're  part of the Duke cult.",955756800,,610,4.7075471698113205
1854054,4,B00008MTW7,"the movie is a good one for anyone who likes John Wayne movies,  for any non U.S. Citizen who knows anything about the history of the United States it has a certain melancholy pathos that has to do with the tragedy that was  the War between the states, only i would like to disagree with the  synopsis,  both colonels go to Mexico to serve the interests of the French  who were at the time trying to conquer Mexico,  the so called ""corrupt  mexican general"" was in the service of Juarez who was the rightful  president, and the ""corrupt"" general just happens to fool both  Gringo colonels into figthing the French and giving him the horses, I do  not think the ""Duke"" would have accepted such a review since he  was allways a friend of Mexico.",916358400,,743,4.42962962962963

7985630,3,B00008MTW7,This isn't a bad movie.  Whenever John Wayne was in a movie.  It always seemed to me that no matter who else was in it with him it always turned out to be a John Wayne movie.  But Rock Hudson does well in this movie also.  They play commanders who fought against each other in the civil war.  The movie has some fights between the two sides who are banding together to go to Mexico.  And you have to see the movie to understand.  There is one great line.  The conversation kind of dried up.  And John Wayne plays a character named John Henry Thomas.  My middle name isn't Henry.  But my name is John Thomas and  even though I was only 9 years old when that came out.  I considered myself the inspiraion for the character.,1525996800,,721,4.175182481751825
