7908037,5,B00000FBJE,How an under dog and victim comes up in the world! Very well done-and Richard Harris in one of his more down to earth roles.,1493510400,,124,4.0
7908038,3,B00000FBJE,"Not the MOST Entertaining Movie I've Ever Seen,  but Ill give it a decent 3 Stars.  I was able to get  to the end. I love movies with people who have accents and watching movies about other cultures, so for me, I made it to the end. Do not think its a movie for everyone.  I also liked the Ending. Hate movies with stupid endings, so I think this was worth the 3 Star's.",1488326400,,370,3.9594594594594597

7908041,1,B00000FBJE,Did anyone in charge of this movie have any idea what (s)he wanted to say? This was less of a film and more of a poorly planned disaster. 1 1/4 stars,1480896000,,149,3.838709677419355

7908043,4,B00000FBJE,"It's too bad the celtic tiger government doesn't support its film industry.  Films such as this  don't make it over here because they're not  supported.  They don't have that sappy 'lucky charms' and leprechaun lack  of mind.  ""Trojan Eddie"" is a tale about the  ""Travellers"" a minority in Ireland whom the Irish don't like to  talk about too much. Richard Harris is the Patriarch and Stephen Rea a a  bumbling jester type. Both are excellent in their roles and the laughter at  the end is warmly chilling.",940896000,12,506,4.712643678160919
