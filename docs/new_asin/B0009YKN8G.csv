8070472,2,B0009YKN8G,I was expecting something different but it was okay as the footage of some parts of Africa. The camera person was not that good.,1396396800,,128,4.375
8070473,5,B0009YKN8G,"Discovering Benin West Africa is exactly what I was looking for, but didn't really think I would find.  It is filmed by an former Peace Corp worker on a return visit to Benin.  This is not a professional travel film, but it is an honest look at real life in Benin.  I lent this DVD to a friend who is going to Benin on a mission trip.  This film will really help her know what to expect, and prepare her for the living conditions she will experience.  It shows the market, the homes, the people; everything you would want to know before going to Benin.  There needs to be more films like this!  Thanks to Fon is Fun for producing this helpful resource.",1245196800,4,652,4.252032520325203
