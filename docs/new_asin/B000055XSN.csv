7931444,5,B000055XSN,THIS DOUBLE BALLET IS UNIQUE AND  I LOVE IT.  BALLERINAS IN HEELS!  COMIC AND IMPRESSIVE.,1504224000,,89,4.8
7931445,4,B000055XSN,"I watched the Concertante three times the first night I received the dvd. Danced to Frank Martin's justly famed music of the same name, rich in subtleties and invention as is the choreography throughout to the delicate and sprightly end. Black Cake begins in a safer more familiar world of the cocktail party ala Twyla Tharp's Sinatra Dances, then gives us two wonderful duets, the second very funny, endly oddly or bravely and amusingly with the dancers acting more than dancing very drunk. Very highly recommended.",1201046400,7,516,5.011627906976744
