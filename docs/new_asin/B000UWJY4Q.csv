8274738,1,B000UWJY4Q,"Amazon website DVD description states ""47 Minutes"" long archival footage. Actual DVD is only ""4 Minutes & 18 Seconds"" long. I don't know if it was recorded wrong or disc is damaged or if this is just not complete. This DVD is over $4.00 per minute at this length. Something is whack here! Would love to know if it was just my copy because I was using this for personal research. Please advise if there are 43 more minutes of footage out there.",1245801600,,443,4.349397590361446
