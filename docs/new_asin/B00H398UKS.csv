8629423,1,B00H398UKS,"Great series is excellent with several short stories per episode done to a very high level. A tribute to Rod Serling for his ability to host, and even write many of the stories. The level of actors and directors he was able to attract was also extraordinary.",1487376000,,258,4.51063829787234

8629425,5,B00H398UKS,"This definitely was one of the best TV series of the era, the 1970s. After Rod Serling's successful run with The Twilight Zone, he embarked on a new series, one suited somewhat of his former work.
This is the complete series bundled together. I would recommend you get them individually as you may save some bucks doing so. I did. I paid roughly 15 for each season, brand new. The deals are out there, you just have to do some looking around and searching a bit for the best price.
Each season has a different ""opening"" to the series. I think I remember the 2nd Season theme song and opening the best. I believe it is the best out of all three.
There are Special Features for each Season, the First does not have any in the way of featurette type.
Season 1:  (3 DVDs in All)  Captioned for the hearing impaired in English (Subtitles in Spanish, French, None)
Season 2:  (5 DVDs In All)
** Revisiting The Gallery: A Look Back
** Art Gallery: The Paintings In Rod Serling's Night Gallery
** NBC TV Promos
** The Night Gallery
Season 3: (2 DVDs In All)
** Audio Commentaries from Night Gallery Historian Scott Skelton and Jim Benson
** Lost Tales From Season 2 (4 episodes in all)

Sound and picture quality from Universal is pretty good on the DVDs. Look for several ""Stars"" of the era in the show. There is an episode with Joan Crawford as well as the memorable Pilot episode with Roddy McDowall. John Carradine stars in one episode entitled ""The Big Surprise"". I think that one and the pilot episode really stood out for me as I seem to remember those the best. There are others that are well done as well and some familiar faces that are no longer around, unfortunately.
Good viewing !!!",1482192000,3,1688,4.435483870967742

8629427,5,B00H398UKS,"This was one I could not pass up as I use to watch it years ago when it first showed on tv, just great.",1471392000,5,103,3.3333333333333335
8629428,5,B00H398UKS,"""Night Gallery"", Rod Serlings other TV series, while not quite as good his first series ""Twilight Zone"" is nonetheless an outstanding show. The big difference I would say between the two is that TZ was more a sci-fi program while NG is more dealing with the macabre and horror. If you are a fan of the ""Night Gallery"" and you don't have the series on DVD then what are you waiting for? All three seasons have been released on DVD now. However if I may I would like to make a suggestion.

The ""Night Gallery: Complete Series (Seasons 1-3)"" is not a box set of the entire series but rather all three individual seasons that has been bundled together. As of the time of this review I have seen the price to buy these three season together anywhere from $80 to $135.00. That is a little bit steep a price even for such a good series as NG. I would recommend that you buy all three seasons individually. In the end you would be saving a lot of money. Each single season runs about $20 give or take a dollar. So to buy the three seasons separately instead of bundled would cost about $60 before shipping and handling. Even when you include S&H the total cost will still be less then the cost to the ""Complete Series"". Whether you buy the series individually or as a bundled pack I do recommend getting this series. It is I think one of the best there was around.",1434931200,29,1356,4.317647058823529
