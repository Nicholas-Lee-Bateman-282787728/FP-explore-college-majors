1640627,5,B00005O6YD,I am so excited to finally find this movie. I have been searching for it for years. I thought I was going to have to buy a used copy (...)!! My daughter is 3 and I have ordered a copy just in time for Christmas. I can't wait to watch it with her!!!,1008288000,2,248,3.69811320754717
1640628,5,B00005O6YD,"I was planning on buying a used vhs on ebay. Then they bring it onto DVD! This is a movie I remember since I was 4. Hopefully they will release Dot and Whale, along with the others in this series. A wonderful movie for children or those young at heart!",1006214400,8,252,4.06
1640629,5,B00005O6YD,"Some of the best childhood memories I have are from this movie.  I used to watch it serval times a day and I would still always seem to cry at the end.

I was two years old when the film was released and to this day, it remains one of my favorites.  It's a movie I watched every day for three years straight and I can't wait to see it again!",1003104000,3,333,3.8115942028985508

1640637,5,B00005O6YD,"I loved this bizarre cartoon as a kid, and now my daughter does. She boohoos at the appropriate spot every time. Good for showing them emotional film without being traumatic.

1640643,5,B00005O6YD,"I'm not sure how in the USA my parents got a copy of this movie when I was a kid (think 1984) but it was my absolute favorite movie growing up.  I spent years trying to find it as an adult, and this DVD did not disappoint!  Some parts are as creepy as I remember them and the mixture of animation and live action is still great.",1389139200,2,328,3.8805970149253732
1640644,5,B00005O6YD,"This was just as wonderful as it was when my kids were young. We taped it when it was on HBO, I think... and it was soon worn out!
I have always wondered why it was not on the mass market.
I purchased 3 so far. My mother wanted one for her great grandchildren and mine went to my granddaughter.
I know it will bring back memories for her dad and create new ones for them.
We practiced the ornithorinkusparidoxis (sorry for the spelling) song for a lot of years.
You know your child has 'it down' when they can (at preschool age) get all those syllables clearly and in order!
Yes, the story has a tear jerking ending... but that presents itself with opportunities to discuss sad endings for them together, yet wonderful memories and lasting love for the future as individuals.
The DVD was in GREAT condition, played nicely and clear!!",1386633600,,833,4.450980392156863
1640645,5,B00005O6YD,So glad to have this movie. I loved it as a kid and was so happy I could purchase it to show the new generations in my family.,1386288000,,126,3.5357142857142856
1640646,5,B00005O6YD,"One of my all time favorite children's movie.  Even though I'm an adult, the first time I saw it years ago with my child, I cried and it still moves me to this very day!  My grandchildren love it too!",1384473600,,200,3.975
1640647,5,B00005O6YD,"Dot and the Kangaroo is must see for any child. There is truly nothing like it. Such a lovely lesson in compassion and empathy. I watched the new copy with my nephew and he laughed and jumped and cried just as I did as a child. It's truly a timeless piece and the Bunyip is still as scary today as he was when we were kids. Also, a great introduction into Australian culture for the little ones.

My little sister and I used to watch this over and over and over on a banged up VHS tape. It was lost years ago and I'm so glad to be able to experience it again.",1384041600,2,559,3.9469026548672566
1640648,2,B00005O6YD,"The movie is outstanding, but it is so washed out it was difficult to see and hard to really enjoy.

1640649,1,B00005O6YD,I loved this movie as a kid.  They showed it on HBO about five times a week in the early 80's.  This copy is horrible.  It skips scenes.  Some of the audio is so muffled that you can't understand the dialogue.  Buy the more expensive version here on Amazon.  I thought I was being smart by saving a few bucks.  I was wrong.  This is unwatchable.  DO NOT BUY THIS COPY.  The movie is great but don't buy this version.,1382918400,,416,4.0875
1640650,3,B00005O6YD,"I thought I was ordering the original Dot and the Red Kangaroo which opens with a real little girl who gets lost in the outback and then turns into a cartoon character.  Some parts of this seem the same but the beginning is different.  Dot starts out as a cartoon character superimposed on ""real"" world (or non-animated) footage.  The video quality is terrible, very blurry.  You cannot even read the opening quote on the screen. The audio is poor too.  It is possible that the video and audio were poor even in the original but, being a child of the 80s, I didn't notice this.

Perhaps this is a pirated version?",1376784000,,613,4.4774774774774775
1640651,4,B00005O6YD,"I loved the Dot series as a child, so I was ecstatic to find the DVD of the first story. I could still sing the kangaroo pouch song even 20 years later. *lol*

The animation is telling of the time it was done, so don't expect too much. However, it is interesting to see the animated world interact with the real world. Some would be more familiar with the technique as done in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and ""Space Jam.""

The music is catchy and memorable.

The pacing may be slow for today's youth except for the fairly young, which works out since they're the target audience.

Children will certainly enjoy the exposure to all of the different animals found in the Australian Outback, but keep in mind that the Outback isn't all fun and games. Between the Bunyip and the Aborigines there are a few scenes that could be scarey for sensitive little ones. You will want to sit down with your child for the first watching to keep an eye on his or her reaction.

Language is appropriate to age, no worries here. You may need to explain some words though because of Australian/British jargon like ""hullabaloo.""

This story does not have a typical Disney everyone-lives-happily-ever-after ending. Dot wasn't about those kinds of stories, but rather taught the lesson that ""after its ups and downs, and you've done your best, life goes on.""

On that note, nothing dies.",1367798400,,1363,4.654166666666667
1640652,5,B00005O6YD,Loved this movie when I was little iam just glad I have this one of the best movies to be,1366761600,,89,3.5
1640653,5,B00005O6YD,When my kids were little they loved this movie they even had a cryed. Now that I have grankids I want then to experience Dot and the kangaroo and see if the reaction is the same.,1362873600,,178,3.9722222222222223
1640654,3,B00005O6YD,At a store in the mall.  Is this version good quality?  Does it have extras?  Anything to justify this price?,1362355200,,109,4.35
1640655,1,B00005O6YD,I guess I didn't remember the story like I thought I did.  The color was faded and the story cannot compete with today's childrens' books.  A child would probably be bored with it and not bother to sit through it.,1359849600,,213,4.3
1640656,5,B00005O6YD,A classic cartoon that I use to watch as a child and was happy to find it on DVD.  I am know able to share my childhood favorites with my children!,1355011200,,147,3.7419354838709675
1640657,5,B00005O6YD,"Saw this cartoon when I was little & too watch it again was so overwhelming, I'm such a fan & living in Australia and understanding the culture made watching the cartoon even more better than when I was little admiring the talking animals and hoping Dot would ind her way home.",1352419200,,277,4.450980392156863

1640659,5,B00005O6YD,This was a favorite in my childhood and for such a small fee it was worth it. I was not expecting a vhs to dvd conversion to be spectacular but if you have a big screen tv you may want to make the screen shrink and not stretch it because the quality is what you would expect from a movie that old. But its still nice to have a hard copy of it.,1317081600,,343,3.712328767123288
1640660,3,B00005O6YD,"I'd just like to add my voice to the chorus of warnings that this video is potentially horrifying for young children. I was reading an article about frightening scenes in children's movies and I suddenly remembered this one, which I watched on VHS many times in the 80s and early 90s.

I was maybe a little sensitive to frights as a child, not overly so, but I suffered serious night terrors because of this movie. The Bunyip scene truly frightened me and while I remember enjoying the rest of the movie hugely (which is why I watched it repeatedly) it took me years to get over seeing this particular phantom in things like reflective surfaces in my room at night. To this day, I remember the closing line of the accompanying song (""...in the moon..."") and how it used to make me feel.

There are many creepy scenes in children's movies, but this one left me feeling truly menaced. If you order this DVD, I strongly recommend you watch it before allowing your child to view it and evaluate the Bunyip scene for yourself.",1305763200,2,1021,4.543478260869565
1640661,5,B00005O6YD,"This was childhood favourite for me, so wanted to get a copy for my young daughter.  I wasn't disappointed.  It is very good quality and just as I'd remembered it. If not a little dated vs current films!!",1299801600,,204,4.342105263157895
1640662,5,B00005O6YD,"""Dot and the Kangaroo"" has proven to be as popular and loved by my three year old grandson as it was with children I babysat 25 years ago...quite amazing and emotional for the children.",1289779200,,185,4.470588235294118
1640663,1,B00005O6YD,"Don't waste your money on this (even if it is inexpensive).  There are missing scenes, scenes out of order, and some scenes are repeated to make the movie very incohesive.  I loved Dot and the Kangaroo when I was a kid and was very disappointed.",1265932800,8,245,4.4222222222222225
1640664,5,B00005O6YD,"I use to love this when I was a kid, and I wanted to share it with my kids.  With no surprise, they loved it too!",1232928000,,113,3.3461538461538463
1640665,1,B00005O6YD,"I was looking at childhood nostalgia on Amazon when I came across this DVD.  I am glad the review includes a warning about the bunyip.  I am not joking when I say this movie TERRIFIED me as a kid.  I remember watching it once on tv, and I have honestly had nightmares for years.  It's not supposed to be a scary movie!  Why it scared me so much I can't say, but it did.  It even baffled my parents.  But the bunyip still pops up in my nightmares to this day (I'm 27!)  Many people love it, but I just caution that young children should be with a parent when they first watch it.",1202947200,,578,4.008771929824562
1640666,3,B00005O6YD,I watched this as a kid in the 80's and at the time I was confused by some parts and mostly scared. Growing up I have wondered if I will ever see this film ever again and WOW here it is on DVD. I think I will buy it but it may not be for every child out there as this darn flic still freaks me out and I am now 30 years old.,1193529600,,324,3.391891891891892
1640667,5,B00005O6YD,Dot and the the Kangaroo is such a wonderful story and this film is a beautifully produced piece of animation.  Our daughter enjoyed watching it over and over when she was little.  I'm so excited to find that I can buy a new copy for her to enjoy with her own family!,1189987200,2,267,4.115384615384615
1640668,2,B00005O6YD,This version by Digiview Entertainment is VERY POOR QUALITY!!! very yellow glow around the characters and the sound is muffled. I love the Dot and the Kangaroo. I was so happy that I found the movie but this was a disappointment. I watched the movie on YouTube and that was better quality than this version from Digiview Entertainment. I gave 2 star because I like DOT but the DVD is poor quality!,1185321600,6,397,4.527777777777778
1640669,5,B00005O6YD,"A classic.  A little intimidating for my 3 year old at the beginning to try to explain about Dot being lost in the woods, but helped to reinforce hand-holding and such.  Just loved the music and my daughter is just mystified with kangaroos now.",1178668800,,244,4.5227272727272725
1640670,5,B00005O6YD,"One of the most incredible animated/live action films. Even better for adults than kids. Cute and charming songs, and so terribly sad at the end.

This is the kind of movie you should show your kids, not obnoxious trash like that green ogre movie.",1168300800,2,247,4.613636363636363
1640671,5,B00005O6YD,"I've been a fan of the Dot movies for as long as I can remember but Dot and the Kangaroo has always been my favorite. The songs are catchy and the animation, while not the greatest (this was the 70s) is still quite good and enjoyable. I will say that most of the characters did not seem to have noticable Australian accents but the voice talent was wonderful just the same. The use of animation and live action was used quite well, too. Over all, this is a movie that is fun and highly recommended to anyone who watched it as a child or just wants something that does not have a lot of senseless violence.",1167955200,2,605,4.224137931034483
1640672,3,B00005O6YD,"Dot and the Kangaroo is the story of a young Australian girl, Dot, who is befriended by a Kangaroo when she gets lost in the bush.

This movie is unique because only the characters are animated. The background is shots of real things, like Dot's house, a real forest, and a real stream.

The film teaches good lessons about the environment, but some of the characters are hard to understand because of Austrailian accents or whiney high voices.

The story is good, but the film is pretty boring to sit through. My 2-year-old seems to like it, but I can't take much of it.",1163635200,3,571,4.471153846153846
1640673,5,B00005O6YD,"Was my daughter's all time favorite cartoon 25 years ago. Aired on HBO way back then. Anyway, just bought it for my grand-daughter and she loves it too. A timeless classic I'd say!",1156809600,6,180,4.484848484848484
1640674,5,B00005O6YD,"Wow...I remember watching this movie every time it came on HBO when I was little (very early 80s)!  I remembered thinking it was so amazing that real scenery could be combined with animation.  I hadn't thought about the movie in years, then one day a few weeks ago, the ""clickety click"" song from the movie popped into my mind and I knew I HAD to find it!!  I got my copy a few days ago, watched it immediately, and all the memories came back.  However, I think my memory of the ""vivid"" scenery was a little skewed because it looks really old and dingy now (maybe the quality of the restoration before putting it on DVD?).  The music was just as I remembered, except now I can definitely hear the 70s influence.  A great movie about how a little girl finds her ""way"" with the help of a very sweet kangaroo.  So the kangaroo never found her joey?  how sad!  Great movie and I can't wait for my 10 month old to watch it when she's a little older.",1149120000,3,944,4.229050279329609
1640675,4,B00005O6YD,I remember seeing this film as a child growing up in Australia.  It was one our family favourites.  We marvelled at how the animation was filmed on top of real footage of the Australian bush.  Although today's animation is much more advanced it is still a beautiful introduction to the Australian bush and animals.  I purchased this film to celebrate Australia Day with my 2 year old daughter and it immediately became her favourite DVD.  She begs to watch it and just loves Dot's introduction to the Platypus.  It has been a wonderful way to share some of the wonders of my country with her.  I hope you and your family enjoy it too!,1140393600,,634,4.508771929824562
1640676,4,B00005O6YD,"I remember this movie from when I was younger.  I believe I first saw it in the really early 1980s, when my family first got HBO.  I still remember it fondly to this day.

This is a cute tale of a young girl and a kangaroo.  It's a very enjoyable story about friendship, although there are some scary moments involving dingos and the mythical Bunyip, whom I always called ""Bun Lip"" for some unknown reason.

I think this is a great movie for parents to watch with their kids, far better than any over-commercialized Disney garbage you might find.  Be forewarned, though.  As I said, there are a few light scares.  They may frighten younger views.  I still highly recommend this selection, though.",1130112000,7,696,4.59349593495935
1640677,5,B00005O6YD,"Oh my gosh! I can't believe it's here!! I was watching Animal Planet and they mentioned Kangaroos and for some reason, my favorite childhood movie ""Dot and the Kangaroo"" popped up in my mind. I didn't even think that Amazon sold it! I'm so happy! :)
Guys, this is a great movie for kids. It obviously still has an impact on me because 24 years later, I'm now 28, and I still remember the film like I watched yesterday. Parents, buy this for your kids it is SO well worth the time and money. :)",1124496000,4,493,4.2

I was at my aunt's house and my mother wanted to leave and I cried whenever she tried to tear me away from the movie. Not strange for a three year old to do, but strange that I still remember it....

I won the battle over whether we would leave before the movie ended, but oh, when we did I was silent, teary, and completely in awe.

 I must have this movie.",1117843200,2,481,3.8877551020408165

People young and old who are very empathetic and imaginative,

I've been looking for this movie for so long.  Every now and again, I'll think about this movie and think about the heartbreak.  I'm planning on ordering it but from memory, it's a good transition (as in growing up) movie for the elementary school age.  I remember watching the movie somewhere in the 1st-4th grade range.  The Last Unicorn movie also reminds me of the heartbreak of breaking ties.

I really enjoyed this movie growing up, even if it was sad at the ending.  I've always had a special bond with animals, so it was sad for me (not to diss my family!).  Wasn't the 80's a great time to be a kid?!",1106956800,7,657,4.284552845528455

IT WAS REALLY SAD AT THE END, BUTI THINK IT'S A GREAT MOVIE.  I AM SO HAPPY I FINALLY FOUND IT ON DVD I'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR THIS MOVIE EVERYWHERE.  IT IS A LITTLE SCARY, KIDS 5 YEARS AND OLDER WOULD APPRECIATE IT MORE THAN YOUNGER KIDS AND NOT BE SCARED.  YOUR KID WILL LOVE IT AS I DO.",1066003200,4,451,3.705263157894737
1640689,5,B00005O6YD,"This movie has inspired me to listen and pay attention to animals more. I have always appreciated the animals and it reinforced the beliefs I had as a child that we are all connected in this world.
This movie teaches us that if we take the time to listen, animals speak and share their wisdom. In spell bound silence I watched this move for the first time since I was 7. I remembered every bit as if it were yesterday that I saw it. A wonderful mix of animation and live-action background!

I have not seen it in probably over 15 years but even now I still remember some of the songs. A word of warning though, the Bunyip is scary! When my friend would come over and we'd be watching he would always be really scared when the bunyip song came on so if your child scares easily you should skip that part of the DVD. I also remember how Dot calls for the kangaroo to come back at the end and it just hops away. Very sad :( Other than that, great movie :)",1050451200,6,557,3.769230769230769
1640692,4,B00005O6YD,"On Christmas day, I was very excited to get this DVD from my mother. I saw a movie about a girl getting lost in the Australian outback when I was a little child on the Disney Channel. It was called ""Dot"", but it was not this movie (I was very disappointed when I found that I recieved the wrong one). The Dot I grew to love was a mixture of animation and real footage, like this one, and it involved a kangaroo, as this one does. It also involved a mmosquito named Skeeto, and I remember a scene where Dot was captured by ants and forced to work along with them. Dot was a real-life human figure at first, the turned into a cartoon by eating a strange carrot, or root. If anyone knows anything about this film, please e-mail me and let me know. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",1040774400,18,794,4.196078431372549
1640693,4,B00005O6YD,"I think this movie is the one I've been looking for!  When I was little I saw a movie about a girl, a kangaroo, and a whale.  From the picture it looks just like what I remember, but there is no whale.  Maybe its in the movie some where.  But the movies great.  It just goes to show that what you show your kids when their little stays with them till they are my age...",1030579200,,369,3.8666666666666667
1640694,3,B00005O6YD,"After several years of looking for Dot, I've found her again in the DVD edition. As a child, the Bunyip from the movie always terrified me, and I had nightmares about the thing as recently as five years ago! But I hadn't seen the movie in 20 years, and just had to satisfy my curiosity... was it really that scary?
To be honest, this is a creepy film. The soft music intended as a lullabye comes across as a bit disturbing. The Bunyip scene is, indeed, scary. The film even shows how the Bunyip can appear in anything... a fire, a cave. It's basically a quick lesson on how children can make anything look like a monster in his/her head! ""The Bunyip's going to get you!""
Most disturbing, though, would have to be the end. I won't kill the conclusion for you, but a read through the actual book by Ethel Pedley would give you a more satisfying, less mystifying end. (It's available for free online at Project Gutenberg)
I'm torn about the film. Overall, I enjoyed it for its nostalgia, and *some* of the music is cute and catchy. I like it for what it is! I couldn't recommend it for a young child, though... it's good old-fashioned nightmare fuel.",1019520000,17,1147,4.440758293838862
1640695,3,B00005O6YD,"I thought that this was a great movie... I watched it 3 times last night and cried every time... Could have been much better if it was a restored print. Even having some background on how the movie was actually done would have been neat to see.
I thought that this movie was a brakthrough film long before Roger Rabbit. It was like Pete's Dragon in a way... An animal helping it's human friend get out of trouble...
The scenes where she cares for the kangaroo were touching.. Even when the kangaroo went home I cried like crazy... It touches on feelings that people experience when a good friend leaves..
I have fond memories of little Dot finding her way home and even after all these years, I still cry... Great little film, but it could have gotten better treatment on the DVD format...",1018915200,8,789,4.486111111111111

This is certainly one of the best children's movies out there, though i haven't watched it in ages.  I am going to buy a copy on DVD for my children (and myself).  I had completely forgotten the title of the movie and had spent about 2 years searching on the internet for what it might be.  I just remembered that it was part-animated, and had a kangaroo, a girl, a platypus, and some caveman drawings.  When i finally happened upon the actual movie, i was ecstatic... and then to find out that it is available on dvd :)
You can't go wrong with this movie",1017964800,7,674,4.1461538461538465

All I can say is that when we were little we loved this movie along with some of the terrific songs. I do not remember being upset about the kangaroo leaving at the end either ! Maybe because I knew that Dot was safe at home !

1640699,5,B00005O6YD,I had this movie when I was little and I loved it so much that I watched it all the time.  What I liked about this movie was the fact that the Kangaroo is really brave and kind hearted and really showed Dot how much she cared about her.  Unfortunatly it got taped over and ever since then I looked for it on video but no luck and then I found a copy on dvd and I was shocked cause it was released in 1981 now I will have it on dvd I'm really happy about it.

7948486,3,B00005O6YD,"Me  &  my  sister use  to  watch  this  when  we  were  little.  There  are  quite  a  few  scenes  where  it  turns  into  a  cartoon.  Dot  starts  off  as  real  life  girl  before  the  show  turns  to  a  cartoon.  You  get  to  see  what  the  animals  look  like  just  before  it  turns  back  to  a  cartoon.  That's  the  interesting  thing  about  the  movie.  How  do  they  do  that?
A  little  girl  named  Dot  wanders  a  little  ways  from  home  &  tumbles  down  a  slope,  &  knocked  unconsciousness.  Later  she  is  awakened  by  a  unnamed  kangaroo.  Dot  claims  she  is  lost  &  unable  to  find  her  way  back  home.
She  her  new  found  friend  explore  the  Australian  outback.  Learn  the  friendly  wildlife  animals  from  the  dangerous  animals.
Its  the  tale  about  love, friendship, respect  &  trust.
There  is  one  scene  that  might  not  be  appropriate  for  younger  viewers.  The  part  where  the  native  people  are  doing  a  dance,  &  you  got  a  guy  with  a  kangaroo  hide  over  him,  the  others  have  got  spears.
That's  the  part  of  the  movie  I'm  talking  about.  The  rest  of  it  doesn't  bother  me.
Her  father  &  a  friend  are  out  looking  for  Dot,  &  shout  several  times.  But  she  is  too  far  away  to  hear  him.  Later  she  finds  her  way  home  with  the  help  of  the  kangaroo  who  refuses  to  go  near  the  house  for  an  introduction.
Its  good  for  real  children  most  of  it  is.

7948492,5,B00005O6YD,"I am going to be turning 39 this year, and to this day, I remember watching this show in kindergarten and subsequently becoming enamored with all things kangaroo. :) I'm not sure what it is about this movie that was so fascinating, but perhaps it had something to do with the combination of real footage and animation of cute, talking animals. I think I got a chance to watch it again a couple years later, much to my delight, but after that, I never saw it again. I think there were other ones in the ""Dot"" series that were played, but ""Dot and the Kangaroo"" eluded me until current modern-day times.

I bought this and sat down and watched it with my 2 kiddos (ages 6 and 10). My 10 year old thought it was interesting and fun to watch, but my 6 year old seemed to be especially fascinated by it like I was at that age. He requests to see this movie time and again, which is really neat. As I was watching it more recently, it was exactly what I remembered it to be, and it really took me back on memory lane. The songs are super cute and catchy, and there is a sort of ""je ne sais quoi"" to it that is timeless and magical. To this day, I still think this is a fantastic animated show that can educate kids about nature (and more particularly about nature in Australia). I am really happy to be able to own it so my kids can enjoy it whenever they want to (a luxury I did not have back in the 80s).

I would highly recommend this for your children, especially if you got the pleasure of seeing it when you were a child.",1458259200,4,1521,4.117845117845118
