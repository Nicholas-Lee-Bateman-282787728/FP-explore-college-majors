2867264,4,B000RH6Q9A,"The HOOPNOTICA video provides good instruction of basic hoop dance moves for beginning hoopers. I can see myself doing these moves smoothly and gracefully after a bit more practice. HOOPNOTICA's trouble shooting segments are especially useful. It is not fancy or exotic like the HOOPGIRL video, but HOOPNOTICA has superior instruction for beginners.",1285718400,7,349,5.60377358490566
2867265,4,B000RH6Q9A,"In Hoopnotica Hoopdance Beginning Level 1, veteran hoopmeisters Rayna McInturf and Keaton Talmadge manage to systematically teach basic moves of the art of hoop dance to virtually anyone with the desire to dance and the appropriate hoop with which to do it.  Their methodology is simple; each segment of the DVD whether viewed in the sequence presented or not offers an introduction that outlines and introduces the subject goal, a demonstration with instructions that repeats the move adequately enough to enforce the mechanics without annoying repetitiveness and a troubleshooting follow-up that details the most common mistakes along with the associative adjustments needed to tweak the move and get it under control.

Hoopnotica Hoopdance Beginning Level 1 details the following hoopdancing maneuvers:  waist hooping,  hip hooping, halos, passing and floating, and corkscrews.  The DVD begins with a general introduction that defines the overall goal of the first level and a warm-up using the hoop as a tool to help stretch the body before attempting to dance.  One of my only complaints about this program is the lack of a dance sequence as a finale that the student can watch and copy that incorporates all the learned moves.  Some fun music and a beginner's routine would have capped off this DVD and launched it into a 5 star rating.

For those who are new to hoop dancing: make sure your hoop is an adult sized hoop made specifically for dancing.  I own two different hoops from two different companies:  the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hoopnotica-Fitness-Travel-Hoop-Combo/dp/B002FGXWQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hoopnotica Fitness Travel Hoop Combo</a>&nbsp;fits the bill nicely as it comes apart and can be easily transported.  Although perhaps a bit flimsy, this hoop is slightly weighted but not to the extreme as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Empower-Cardio-Core-Hoop-with-DVD/dp/B001LRWZFE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Empower Cardio Core Hoop with DVD</a>&nbsp;is.  The Empower model is too heavy, making performing halos, passing and floating and corkscrews a little more painful if done incorrectly.  Stick to a hoop made with dancing and not strict cardio hula-hooping in mind.  A further caution--exercise or dance with your hoop in either a studio with a lot of individual space that does not restrict your movement and an extremely high ceiling with no dropped paddle fans or outside on level ground.  When I use my backyard as my dance palace, I am unable to view the DVD instructions simultaneously, so some adaptation must be made:  I watch first, try it and then observe again to make the appropriate adjustments helped out greatly with the troubleshooting segment.  Even though I am not the most graceful dancer it didn't take me long at all to learn the first few moves and totally enjoy what I was doing.  Working on the halos and the pass and float moves requires a little more space and a bit more patience.  Nonetheless with very little practice, I was able to master these maneuvers with little additional viewing of the corresponding segments.  Presently, I am working on smoothing out my corkscrew move--it took me a while to realize I had to rotate within the hoop to get it to settle on my waist/hip from halo position.  Once accomplished, the body remembers the feel of the move and it becomes ingrained as part of the overall repertoire.

In general, hoop dancing is a fun way to tone the body and work up a healthy, cleansing sweat.  Initially, you will feel the stress in your arms as you work through halos and passing and floating; similarly you will feel your waist and hips working as you keep the hoop in movement around your body.  Although the two dancers featured on this DVD are in their prime, this activity makes a wonderful group activity for all ages and activity level--there is a local retreat house that sponsors a Cancer Survivors Weekend where I think this type of class would be phenomenally fun and therapeutic.  My only other less positive comment is to depict dancers of all ages to illustrate the agelessness of this activity. Don't dis those of us who want to age gracefully and defiantly!

Bottom line? Hoopnotica Hoopdance Beginning Level 1 teaches the rudiments of hoopdancing in a concise and extremely efficient manner.  Pop it into your DVD if you want to learn waist hooping, hip hooping, halos, passing and floating and corkscrews and then practice, practice, practice your way to a wonderfully therapeutic form of exercise that will keep you ""hoopy.""  Looking forward to mastering my corkscrews to move onto&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hoopnotica-Hoopdance-Beginning-Level-2/dp/B000RHXCMO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hoopnotica Hoopdance Beginning Level 2</a>.

2867266,2,B000RH6Q9A,"I haven't been able to watch this much because the DVD won't play in my normal (otherwise functioning) DVD player. It will play on my computer's DVD player, but without sound. The DVD will play fine on my laptop, but that's not a screen that's very conducive to practicing in front of. The DVD does play on my friend's DVD player for some reason. Also, I bought volumes 1 and 2 and both are so short, it seems obvious that they could have put all of the lessons on one DVD. I guess they knew they could make more money by making us buy both.",1271808000,,541,4.161904761904762
2867267,5,B000RH6Q9A,i was an absolute beginner and found the these dvds to be well worth the money. these girls have a very professional and easy to follow method for teaching you the basics of hoop dancing. step by step instructions lead you through a variety of tricks and moves.  you can pause rewind and watch it over and over till you get it. the trouble shooting sections for each move are very helpful also. within a few weeks i had mastered all of the tricks they teach and am looking forward to the intermediate level dvd. i was very happy with this product and thoroughly recommend this dvd. ( i know this sounds like i was paid to say this but believe me i found these dvds totally randomly and was very happy i did),1220227200,2,707,4.276119402985074
2867268,4,B000RH6Q9A,"The production quality is great but, personally, I would have liked to find more exercises and moves on this dvd (this is why I gave it only 4 stars). It is just 40 minutes long. If you have never been able to hula hoop, then maybe you need patience and... a good friend. I have tried it alone and have given up after a few tries. After a couple of days I have tried again with a friend and it was much more fun: we have begun again and again and sometimes it has worked for 3-4 seconds, which I was proud of :-).

Rayna suggests 'throwing' the hula hoop well the first time and shows this by moving just her arms and the hula hoop. Even without moving your hips, the hula hoop should circle around your waist or hips 2 or 3 times. I found this information helpful. While throwing the hula hoop the first time, lead it well with your hand, pressing it a little against your belly.

Good luck!",1217721600,,892,4.1502890173410405
2867269,5,B000RH6Q9A,"After ordering this DVD & level 2 and also ordering Christabels Hoopdance for Beginners, I have to say that Hoopnotic is definitely the way to go. Though you get more for your money with Christabels Hoopdance for beginners (because she only has one volume which actually has more moves than both of Hoopnotics volumes combined), Hoopnotics DVDs are much more instructional. They are classier and even have a troubleshooting section which can be SO helpful when you can't get something right. It made me much less intimidated to try moves I hadn't even seen before. Know that it isn't an exercise video, but once you learn all the moves to hoopdance, you do get an amazing work out.",1206403200,92,681,4.779661016949152

I've seen it described as a workout video and while keeping a hula hoop going is a workout, this is no workout plan.  Basic instructions and tips for waist, hip, and chest hooping can be found here.  I'd only recommend it for those curious about hooping who have done no other research.  I'm a total beginner and had already seen everything here on YouTube, often those YouTube videos had better or more complete tips for the clumsier less fit amongst us (though kudos to the Hoopnotica folks for recreating all of our beginner mistakes).",1442102400,4,680,4.886956521739131

2867284,3,B000RH6Q9A,"This is a good workout, however, it takes a very large empty space, think an entire bedroom size area or larger, to safely perform all moves. I got through the first 30 minutes of the video by minimizing movements so I didn't get the full impact of moving with the hoop. Had to just watch and just keep moving for the rest as I didn't have the space to do what was needed. There is also a great deal of down time between segments, so don't kid yourself that you are getting what I would term a FULL hour of workout with it without continuing the basic stance hoop in between segments. Added to my difficulty besides very limited space, I am a short, round person, but very active, pass and floats were difficult as I can't get my hands together or even close behind my back (yet). Great instructional, easy to follow. Nice slow pace. Would be perfect if everyone had a gym size room to do this at home.",1426032000,,902,4.280701754385965

2867288,2,B000RH6Q9A,"If you are truly a beginner, this video will not help you. I never hooped much as a child but I wanted to learn for a good workout at home and for tricks and fun at festivals. The first chapter basically says something like: start hooping, good! Next chapter is about walking and turning and then moving from waist to hip. Each lesson is only a few minutes long. It's not like you can watch someone telling you to just hula hoop and you'll be able to do it.  So it's hard to move past the first 3 minutes if you can't keep the hoop up for more than a minute. If you don't hoop but want to learn, I suggest just going for it and teaching yourself. Once you can go for several minutes without dropping, then watch the video.",1418688000,5,722,4.120567375886525

2867328,5,B000RH6Q9A,this is an excellent workout for a beginner hooper.  I've been hooping for about 7 months and i have mild scoliosis and degenerative disk disease so i have been taking my time with the beginner moves.  this video is perfect for learning the basic moves and has a nice warm-up to prevent injuries.  I already knew most of the moves except i'm having trouble perfecting them and with halo transitions from lower body to above my head.  The troubleshooters section of this dvd helped me tremendously.  I'm getting the second video asap.  I recommend it to all new hoopers.  Enjoy!,1368057600,,577,4.71

I started watching  hoopnotica's DVD last week and was amazed with how much easier it was to understand the moves. Now that I feel like I actually get the moves and can do them , I'm ready to get the rest of hoopnotica's DVD's.

People tried to explain how to do it, I just could never understand the process or logistics of it. Hoopnotica explains just how to hoop so clearly, and you also get to watch exactly how they do it! I purchased a weighted hoop, I drop the hoop plenty ofbtimes, but I'm ecstatic that I can hoop now for several minutes at a time. Whoot! Very happy with this purchase!!

They give you a ton of trouble shooting tips on how to improve so you don't become frustrated during the learning process. It is a beginner dvd but I was happy to see that it had some tricks that are, in my opinion, beyond beginner. There is nothing worse then getting a beginner dvd and watching it once and mastering it too quickly.
When I got the dvd I was just able to keep the hoop up. Now I can see the foundation of hoop dancing with the help of the dvd.

If I can't seem to get the hang of how they are saying to do something, it usually ""clicks"" after I have worked at it a little bit and I am like ""okay, I get it!"" I am getting it down one chapter at a time like they say you are supposed to. I am starting to see some real progress and find myself laughing and having fun. I don't usually do that when I am exercising:  When I have mastered this DVD I will definitely be purchasing the next level in the series.

2867347,5,B000RH6Q9A,"Hoopnotica Hoopdance Beginning Level 1, in an approximately 60 minute format with excellent production quality, provides clear and detailed instruction for those new to hooping plus correction of common mistakes in sections called ""troubleshooting"" at the end of each topic and focuses on both on-the-body (waist, hips) and off-the-body moves; shoulder/chest and thigh hooping are not included and are on Beginning Level 2. It is divided into a 40 minute main section and a 20 minute bonus section which includes a brief hoopdance demo.

These two videos together, Beginning Level 1 and Beginning Level 2, provide an excellent introduction to hooping.

Though some find it too slow paced or suggest skipping it and going straight to Beginning Level 2 if you are not a ""true beginner"", I think that this DVD contains enough helpful tips that many who are not brand new to hooping may still find something they did not know and, contrary to what another reviewer stated, material introduced in Level 1 is not duplicated in Level 2 which introduces very different material.

If you are looking for a follow along work-out with an in-real-time routine, that is not what this DVD is about.

Also, be aware that Hoopnotica has put out the same or similar material at different points under slightly different names and, as of August 2011, many are still available through amazon.com; some say Beginning Level, some say Beginner Level and some say Workout but they are all different editions of the same instructional material with minimal variation ... or so say the Hoopnotica staff I spoke to when, confused, I called to clarify.

I think it is excellent and recommend it to anyone who is looking to have technique and moves explained and demonstrated. It does this very well - no more, no less.",1312416000,39,1791,4.956666666666667

Volume 2 is a better way to start if you have done any hooping in the past. Totally worth every penny!",1292198400,,391,3.7804878048780486

8200716,4,B000RH6Q9A,"First, some background:
I attended one hula hoop class at a gym that taught me the very basics  literally how to get the hoop moving around my waist and basic hand movements. It was a lot of fun, hula hooping is the type of workout that doesn't ""feel like a workout"". The instructor of the class made hula hoops, so I purchased one from her. Helpful tip  the larger the hula hoop, the easier it is to move around your body as a beginner. When you get more experienced then you can move to a smaller hoop.

Now the video:
Pros
 Teaches you new moves in a step-by-step fashion. They break it down first, do the move slowly and then speed up to give you a full picture.
 The moves get gradually more difficult as the video continues, so this one video has a decent amount of content to keep you learning.

Cons
 You must know the basics, aka how to hula hoop, first. This video then expands on that.
 It goes through the movements very quickly, so I found myself constantly rewinding to fully understand. I wish that they would repeat the move for longer periods of time, so that could truly copycat the movement alongside them.",1493424000,5,1125,4.375

8200718,3,B000RH6Q9A,"From reading the other reviews it seemed as though this was great for beginners, but in my experience it is not. If you're a beginner you should learn before you try. There is a very quick explanation, but that's it. I paused the video several times and watched videos online to learn. This is a great workout video, however I would not recommend for beginners.",1469404800,3,361,4.569230769230769
