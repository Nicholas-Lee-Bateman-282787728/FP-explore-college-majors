7793232,2,0871272962,"The content in this DVD is very accurate and encompasses all I know about dancing on pointe.  However, the quality of the DVD is very poor.  The picture scrambles and gets fuzzy from time to time making viewing difficult and frustrating.  It's like the speed of the DVD is not accurate.  I might suggest the Production Company consider making future editions of this DVD with better quality.  Although the content is great, knowing then what I know now, I wouldn't pay the somwhat high price tag due to the poor viewing quality.",1269820800,,528,4.695652173913044
