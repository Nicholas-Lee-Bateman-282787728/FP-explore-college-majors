If you are already highly skilled in portrait lighting then this may not be right for you, but hearing and watching a top level pro like Hauser work is definitely worth $10.

Please note that these are more classical lighting setups designed to flatter the subject. This is not Jill Greenburg lighting.

Great video. Thanks, Marc!",1381795200,,457,4.846153846153846
7990841,5,B00009IXML,"This DVD has plenty of quick tips, techniques and ideas to draw from for the start up to intermediate pro photographer.  Established pros might turn their nose up at it as ""formula"" or ""useless"" - that's because they don't want anyone to know this stuff - new photographers turning pro are a threat to them!  Even if you are more advanced and take away just a couple of new ideas to try from it - it has paid for itself and then some.

Highly recommended.",1229644800,3,455,4.329411764705882
