4401008,5,B004LB5F90,"This workout is great for beginners or experienced exercisers looking for a quick effective workout.  There are three different 20 minute workouts; strength, cardio and yoga and after each workout Holly tells you how many times you should do each workout a week for good results.",1313971200,,279,5.065217391304348
4401009,5,B004LB5F90,"I recently saw a segment of this workout on Exercise TV and loved it so much I added to my exercise DVD collection.  This DVD has 3 20 minute segments - Cardio, Total Tone & Yoga Energizer.  Holly is a wonderful instructor explaining each move with clear, precise instructions, and the equiptment you need is a set of weights and yoga mat. At the end of each segment Holly tells you how many times to use the workout to get great benefits, and for the exerciser you come away feeling you have worked your entire body. I workout 3 days a week along with taking a water aerobic class in the evening and this DVD is perfect for my Thursday workouts.  I find some mornings when my muscles are a little sore just doing one of the 20 minute segments in the morning my soreness goes away and I feel wonderful.

Whether you are a beginner or intermediate exerciser and are looking for a exercise workout that targets the whole body in 50 minutes this is the DVD to add to your collection.",1306800000,17,980,4.33879781420765
4401010,2,B004LB5F90,"She's a great instructor, loved her on exercise tv but this workout routine is very boring. If you are intermediate or advanced, don't buy.",1365638400,,139,4.833333333333333
4401011,5,B004LB5F90,I stumbled across this work out over a year ago on ondemand. I loved it right away it was perfect for time only 20 mins for 1 workout and it gets your heart rate up nice and works everything in your body. I remember after a week of doing it straight i felt in much better shape and could feel a slimmer me. Then on demand got rid of it and i was bummed! I should have j ordered a new one but i just didn't have enough time. But ill tell ya i contiuned to used some of the moves like the chest flys tricep tap back and my arms got in excellant shape not to too muscley but toned and defintion and with the moves stayed that way. I was so happy to see this workout again on my bluray amazon tv. Ordered it right away!!,1364428800,,716,3.8445945945945947
4401012,5,B004LB5F90,I work out at least 5 times a week and the 10 minute yoga is fantastic have more enery and feel better after Exercising with Holly,1362873600,,130,4.038461538461538
4401013,5,B004LB5F90,"Holly does some nice morning wakeup type workouts.  I have some little hip, back issues and her workouts don't aggravate them...

Unfortunately, don't have a dvd player in the house any more...gotta find a streaming version.",1362096000,,224,5.194444444444445
4401014,2,B004LB5F90,"I did this once and was so bored, went back to Denise Austin in a flash!  Having said that, I'm sure it would be a good workout but it's just every boring.",1359417600,,155,3.84375
4401015,5,B004LB5F90,I love this. it is really helping my fitness level. I love all the different choices and combinations of time and Holly is fab!,1358467200,,127,4.333333333333333
4401016,5,B004LB5F90,My wife uses this almost daily and she is hot. Holly Perkins also looks really great. we like this DVD very much,1358035200,,112,4.136363636363637
4401017,5,B004LB5F90,"Fabulous workout,she explains it well,and it is effective without being to hard on your body!!! I bought 1 for myself & 1 for each of my daughters.  love the workout!",1357948800,,166,4.533333333333333
4401018,1,B004LB5F90,"I wish I could return the dvd. I loved the workout. I rented it first, then purchased it. It worked once on my MacBook. After that I got a message saying that there was a problem with the dvd player in the computer.  Used it with a dvd player and it worked for a week or so and then just didn't play.",1357257600,,300,3.838709677419355
4401019,5,B004LB5F90,"A little over a year ago I got serious about exercise, at 51 years of age as I realized if I don't start moving now I won't be able to move when I'm older.  I started with a goal of 30 minutes of exercise daily and this was on the now defunct exercise tv.  It's about 23 minutes long and boy is it great.  I could not believe that I could exercise for 23 minutes and cover legs, arms, butt, thighs, stomach, shoulders and do some cardio too.  She explains everything very well and is very perky, yet not annoying.  I really like her and she also wants you to be successful without killing you but pushing you to move past your comfort zone. Easy to follow and does jumping jacks, jump rope as the cardio and the only thing I have a problem with is sometimes have to instead of jump up on 2 feet, just do one foot at a time as I do find it a heavy impact even with good aerobic shoes, but I'm a big lady, 220, but you still get a great workout, then squats, shoulders on floor, abs, she repeats the sequences and gives you little tips and it's great to do in the morning before work when I want a workout but haven't got a lot of time, she's great & wish she had more videos.  Glad I started exercising, have more energy, stamina & deal with stress better.",1355529600,4,1255,4.060728744939271
4401020,5,B004LB5F90,"I love Holly Perkins' workouts. I coupled this with my elliptical workout and felt like I got a great full body workout: cardio, strength followed with some nice stretches.",1350345600,,172,4.9655172413793105
4401021,5,B004LB5F90,"This dvd is great for anyone who wants a good workout but doesn't have all the time in the world to go to the gym.  You get 3 workouts: 10min yoga, 20min tone up and 20min cardio.  I know it doesn't look like much, but you will feel these workouts.  It was one of the few workouts from exercise tv that I consistently did and missed when the site suddenly stopped.  I would also recommend the 10 Pound Slimdown with Chris Freytag.",1350259200,,430,4.2073170731707314
4401022,5,B004LB5F90,Very good workout and is very challenging in my opinion.  I wanted one that incorporated some strength and cardio and they are 20 minutes which is perfect.,1349827200,,155,4.7407407407407405
4401023,5,B004LB5F90,"Quick, focused exercise routines for those  short on time wanting a routine for the whole body. Really like the 10 minute yoga.  We enjoy mixing this one with several other exercise videos for variety",1344643200,,200,4.852941176470588
4401024,5,B004LB5F90,"I discovered this while exercise tv was still part of comcast. I hate dvds where the trainer is super ripped..I don't want to look like that so why would I do those workouts! Holly is toned but still looks like she would fit in non-tailored shirts and pants :)  I love how perky the workout is and it isn't bootcamp stlye. If I want someone to scream at me I'll drive in Chicago during rush hour. I do these a few times a week and it always makes me feel great while getting my heart rate up. Holly, if you are reading this, make more dvds!!",1333584000,,541,4.10377358490566
4401025,2,B004LB5F90,"I couldn't find much about this video that I liked. I know exercise routines are subjective, but I was disappointed after reading the high reviews(who is paying these people)! Here's what I didn't like:  Instructor started off jumping rope, she talked unnecessarily throughout, and the music was awful, and... the yoga had same music as aerobic part..huh?!! I have bought many, many exercise videos over the years and admit I like fun or somewhat interesting ones.  My favorites are Richard Simmons party off pounds, any leslie sansome,  and tantric yoga.  This one just didn't make the cut.",1331942400,3,591,5.061855670103093
4401026,5,B004LB5F90,"I love this video!

It is broken out into two 20 minute segments and one 10 min yoga segment.  The 20 min. segements are great to alternate, very easy to follow and the instructor Holly Perkins is very perky and clear on her instructions.

Just wished the ""Yoga Energizer"" segment was longer than 10 mins.  I usually alternate between the two 20 min workouts and wrap it up with the Yoga Energizer.

These workouts are perfect if you do not have alot of time but still want to get your strength, toning and cardio all in one.  Overall very satisfied with this purchase!",1330300800,,569,4.475728155339806
4401027,5,B004LB5F90,"I bought this for the 10 minute yoga workout.  The yoga workout provides nice transitions from each yoga pose and stretch and is easy to do.  In 10 minutes I get a great stretch and feel more energized.  I have not even used the other 2 programs yet, so I consider those bonus.  I even bought a copy for a friend and she loves the 10 minute yoga workout.",1328918400,,354,4.086956521739131
4401028,5,B004LB5F90,"I first found these workouts through Exercise TV on demand, and I really liked the yoga and cardio exercises (toning was not available at the time). Holly is good at motivating without condescending, and while I could do the workouts as a beginner, I feel like they are challenging enough for someone in better shape than me to still get a lot out of them.

I decided to buy the DVD once Exercise TV shut down, and I've been doing the workouts on my own schedule, but I would love to take a look at the workout plans that go along with the exercises. I obviously can't get them on the Exercise TV website anymore -- anybody know if there is another way to find them??",1328572800,3,667,4.2936507936507935
4401029,5,B004LB5F90,"Extremely thorough, and effective workout. I found this along with many others through Cable TV (formerly On Demand ExerciseTV). Unfortunately, this is no longer available. This was one of the last I viewed, terrific workout. Sooo glad I found it on Amazon. Three twenty minute workouts that are not hard to follow, but well worth it. Quickly became a favorite of mine. Give it a try!",1328572800,,384,4.833333333333333
8434100,4,B004LB5F90,"Good workouts for the getting-in-shape. I really feel she maximizes each move to get a thorough workout and really coaches you on important technique. My only complaint is there a lot of lunge-type moves, and I have a bad knee. Wish there was a suggested modification for those moves.",1448409600,,284,4.816326530612245
8434101,3,B004LB5F90,I ordered this after watching a friend use the yoga based workout.  My husband and I did that workout together and enjoyed it but it did not really have a warm up and cool down. We plan to combine this routine with Rodney Yee's morning video which truly is a stretch and warm up prior to a more strenuous workout. Holly's other two workouts have too much jumping and running for us.,1445385600,,382,4.305555555555555
8434102,5,B004LB5F90,I've been using this for several years and never get tired of it.,1436140800,,65,4.076923076923077
8434103,5,B004LB5F90,"This might be might favorite workout video of all time. She is a great instructor--informative, keeps it moving, positive and excited about what she is doing, but not annoyingly peppy. Depending on how you do it, it can be somewhat intense or just a mild workout. The segments are short but you feel like you've got a lot done in that 20 minutes. If you need more, you could add on the 10 stretch/yoga segment at the end of a 20 min. segment or just do both 20 minute segments + the yoga part. I love that it focuses somewhat on the back and shoulders and arms, which I really need, but hardly ever see a workout that targets those parts. For me, this is perfect.",1423008000,,663,4.26984126984127
8434104,4,B004LB5F90,"I got this after watching her on You Tube.  I had been just walking to Leslie Sansone great beginner dvd. This one is much more powerful.  Since I am not in good shape I can't guarantee this one for someone who is already been doing a changeling workout.  If your looking for something with cardio and strength training  this is for you. I was unable to complete the entire workout.  But you can definitely  feel it.  So if you want to pump up cardio she uses 5-8 pound dumbbells and a yoga mat.  Have your mat out and ready because by the the time I got my mat out I was behind, so that is just a nice thing to know in advance.  She does hit most large muscles.  I will get working on this one.  I would recommend this one, I like this girl.",1403222400,,742,4.048275862068966
8434105,4,B004LB5F90,I like this workout a lot because of the length.  I am one for shorter workouts.  :)  I did this workout for approximately 5 weeks 4 times a week and I did see results.,1393286400,,168,3.8823529411764706
8434106,5,B004LB5F90,"This was a simple, yet effective workout.  Unfortunately, I could only rent it, or buy a physical copy.  Would much prefer to buy it and add to my Amazon Instant Video library.",1390694400,,176,4.46875
8434107,5,B004LB5F90,"I worked out to this when it was offered free on cable.  When it was replaced, I had to buy it.",1385251200,,95,3.5238095238095237
8434108,5,B004LB5F90,"Surprisingly, what makes Holly Perkins' ""Fitness 360"" so useful is that it isn't too difficult, but yet it works all the major muscle groups and gets results. I was competitive athlete in my youth and still have the mindset that a workout needs to hurt to be effective. But now that I am living in a crowded city and have a demanding job, I am often either too tired or time-constrained to fit in what I consider a decent workout, and I don't want to dodge cars and bicyclists on the street if I go for a run. I find myself getting out of bed in the morning, feeling that one of the workouts on the video is something I can do, whereas the other workout videos I have that are more challenging (like Jillian Michaels or Tracy Anderson) continue sitting on my shelf. And then I feel fantastic afterward! It makes a difference all day long, and that in itself is motivating.

We get so busy in our lives and often spend hours hunched over a laptop or driving or riding the bus to work, that we forget how important it is to move. When I am doing this video regularly, I find I have more energy to do other things like running or hiking, when I have the opportunity. I feel more flexible and strong and am naturally oriented toward more movement. As Holly would say ""It's brilliant!""

Holly explains each exercise and so the more you play the video, the more it may seem like you're wasting time waiting around before the next exercise, so I will usually just jog in place or do additional arm exercises with arm weights while I wait for the next move. (I use 1-kilo weights, which might be less than the ""5-8 pounds"" she mentions, but I still get muscle toning and my arms look great.) I also do a couple minutes of additional ab work after the video (as time allows). But I really believe that if you only did the exercises from this video four times a week, you would still see improved muscle tone and feel more fit in only a few weeks' time. Basically, this is a video that you WILL use, because mentally, it's easy to do, particularly since only takes around 20 minutes to squeeze in. And when you do it regularly, you will see a difference. Maybe you won't be in good enough shape to do a triathlon, but you'll have more energy and will look better in and out of your clothes than if you put off exercising for another day, when you think you'll have more time and energy!",1378684800,3,2376,4.313199105145414
8434109,5,B004LB5F90,"I bought these videos off Exercise TV when it was still up. They are perfect for a busy person! I use them when I don't have time to get to the gym, but want to get a workout in. I also do the 10 min yoga after a long walk or run.  Great product!",1365984000,,246,3.5555555555555554
