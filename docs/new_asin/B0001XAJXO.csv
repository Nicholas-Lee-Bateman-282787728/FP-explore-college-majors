8017540,3,B0001XAJXO,"This film was pretty well-received by critics and those who like serious films.  Having watched quite a few war documentaries recently I entered a bit jaded.

The filmmaker is German and the story is about a journalist documenting the civil war in Beirut, Lebanon (a fictional story, but much of it apparently set in Lebanon).  The destruction he saw all around reminded him of the bombed-out cities when he was a child in the aftermath of World War II.

This film could tie in nicely with Talebs Black Swan, as he eloquently explained how growing up in Lebanon, a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural, multi-religious, peaceful, democratic and prosperous place in an otherwise war-torn Middle East and it seemed absolutely unthinkable to the population that it was about to fall into civil waror if there were any, they felt sure that it would be short [just like all sides in World War I were saying Home by Christmas]

The director (through the characters) seems to castigate himself as well as journalists and photographers for just standing by and not doing anythingas if one journalist or photographer could solve the conflict!  Indeed, it seems to me that simply reporting to the world at large is exactly their mission, and they couldn't do anything better.

The fictional journalist interviews both sides in this conflict, the Christian phalangistsremember them?  I recall the name; I think they have been pretty much wiped out of existencemost likely because the oil-exporting countries gave the Moslem side a lot more support than Western countries gave to them.

Both sides, of course, proclaim the rightness of their cause while committing terrible atrocities.

And in case you need a sledgehammer to drive home the point, this is a European film so naturally the conflict within the main character must mirrors the political conflict that he sees all around him, and the film ends up with it all more or less unresolved.  I give this a C+.",1436832000,2,1945,4.972222222222222

8017543,5,B0001XAJXO,"excellent but location filming raises ethics concerns*** This review may contain spoilers ***

This is a really excellent film. I did find the use of the war-torn Beirut as a ""backdrop"" ethically troubling. To their credit, however, the director/crew also wrestled with the conflict between filming and helping people caught in a desperate situation. I base this latter statement on the DVD containing interviews and extra features. Hanna Scygulla and Bruno Ganz are outstanding. Possible spoiler?: Their interaction in the wonderful house as war rages around them leaves an indelible impression. The characters are complex as reflects the complexity of the situation and locale. Spoiler: Hanna S's decision to adopt a child she encounters is particularly nuanced and affecting.",1294617600,5,778,5.53781512605042
8017544,5,B0001XAJXO,"The German film director Volker Schlondorff is rapidly becoming one of my favorite directors. Coming just after his masterpiece The Tin Drum, Circle of Deceit gives  an accurate picture of the horrors that occurred in Beirut during the 70s and 80s. It was filmed in the city when violence was peaking in 1981 and features Bruno Ganz as a war correspondent. The gunfire and explosions we see are all too real.
Schlondorff is unique in that each of his films reflect a different perspective on the Nazi experience and the horrors of war that he observed during WW2. Each film is like a chapter in one long book. If you liked Oliver Stone's film Salvador you will like this one.",1266624000,7,675,4.625
8017545,5,B0001XAJXO,"Made by German director Volker Schlondorff shortly after his Academy Award winning ""The Tin Drum,"" this film plunged his crew and cast into the middle of Beirut during the civil war that had been raging there for six years. In the film, he attempts to comprehend the kind of urban political violence that has wracked cities from Sarajevo to Kabul to Baghdad in the years since. He explains correctly in the making-of short and an interview included on this DVD that in the absence of a strong central government, the militias of competing warlords, armed by other nations, have the capacity to continue in this kind of conflict for years, using fear, atrocity, and intimidation to turn ethnic groups against each other.

Along with a journalist, played by Bruno Ganz, we observe the daily and nightly routines of assaults and retaliations, the bombs and fire fights, the snipers, and the brutalizing of noncombatants. Schlondorff seems to be asking the audience to examine its own position as outsiders, viewing the carnage and mayhem almost as voyeurs. And we see how the events that reduce life to less than human or snuff it out altogether are reduced even further by the media churning it into news.  In one scene, a man auctions off a handful of gruesome photographs to two competing news agencies.

As Schlondorff says, the ruined city streets and abandoned bombed-out buildings where they shot scenes were little different from those he knew as a boy in the aftermath of WWII. Ganz, we learn, was never comfortable working on the film, while his co-star, the amazing Hanna Schygulla, is clearly at home here and gives a breath-taking performance as the widow of a Lebanese Arab. The film is troubling and unnerving and certainly current, though it was made over 25 years ago.",1194220800,17,1782,4.894039735099338
