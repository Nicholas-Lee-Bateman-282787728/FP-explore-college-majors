403134,4,6301977343,"Here's an interesting Fred Astaire film from the late fifties that is both dated and timeless. The timelessness comes from Fred and Cyd Charisse in a great musical romantic comedy. The dated aspects are most of the digs at the Cold War Russians, but it's all part of the fun.
In this retelling of ""Ninotchka"", lots of comedy mileage is gotten from the Cold War and the sad state of the Russian citizenry (""You mean you want to get IN to Russia? Of your own free will?!""). Three whole numbers are dedicated to the misery of being a Russian under Communist rule (""Siberia"", ""Too Bad, We Can't Go Back to Moscow"", and ""The Red Blues""). Some other tunes like ""It's a Chemical Reaction, That's All"" pit the Commie view of love against the good ol' red white and blue all-American view.
Two numbers, ""All of You"" and ""Silk Stockings"", are both well worth the price of admission. There has never been a finer example of the pure grace in the art of dance than when Cyd and Fred perform in ""All of You"". In the ""Silk Stockings"" number, Cyd solos in a balletic dance showing how the Russian robot becomes seduced by the luxury and femininity of Paris.
The Cole Porter songs are okay, but hardly his apex. ""Ritz Roll and Rock"" is an interesting curio if nothing else, as Porter and Astaire try their hand at rock n' roll. Even though the song is so-so, the dance number is pretty good, and when the curtain rises on Fred in this one, you know he and he alone owns the dance floor... before the dance even starts!
""The Poet and Peasant Overture"" is included as a short subject, apparently to show off the new miracle of the CinemaScope widescreen process. As an odd, but added treat, an early Bob Hope short ""Paree, Paree"", rounds things out. Bob gets second billing to the (now) forgotten actress Dorothy Stone in this 1934 musical tidbit. There's even a strange, Busby Berkeley look to the impromptu dance numbers, with a score of leggy dancers forming ever-evolving star and pinwheel patterns.
A good disc by far for Fred fans, and a keeper, regardless.",1055030400,32,2045,4.559782608695652
403135,4,6301977343,"In hindsight ""Silk Stockings"" proved to be one of MGM's last great musical acheivements and Fred Astaire's final appearance in a musical worthy of his inimitable talents.  Astaire plays, Steven Canfield, a rotten capitalist and movie producer who butts heads with communist, special envoy, Nina Yoshenko, who has been sent from Moscow to Paris to apprehend a wayward Russian composer.  The cast also includes Janis Paige in a hilarious and campy lampoon of an 'Esther Williams-type' actress attempting to play Napoleon's Josephine in a musical remake of ""War and Peace"".  Peter Lorre and Jules Munshin are at their comedy best as two communist sympathizers wooed by the pleasures of Paris.
AT LAST - a transfer worthy of the elegant Mr. Cole Porter.  Warner Home Video gives us a rich looking, robust sounding DVD that really celebrates the performances in this memorable musical.  Colors are deep, rich, gorgeous and consistant throughout.  Contrast and shadow levels are outstanding.  Fine details are amazingly sharp.  Edge enhancement, shimmering and aliasing are practically non-existant.  There is no pixelization or film or digital grain to speak of, for a thoroughly smooth but sharp visual presentation that will surely please.  The audio has been remixed to 5.1 and is marvelous, rich sounding and fully realized within the confines of its dated characteristic.
Extras: Another Cole Porter/making-of featurette that is really a throw away, save the few glimpses of Cyd Charisse and Janis Paige that we get.  Theatrical trailer and cast bios and a couple of short subjects - not anamorphically enhanced, even though the film (thank heaven) is!
Bottom Line: This disc is a must have and the only DVD of the Cole Porter bunch worthy of your hard earned money.  BUY IT TODAY!",1050969600,33,1781,5.167247386759582

Unfortunately this film doesn't show the talent of Sonneveld; he was a GREAT singer and a GOOD comedian. Nevertheless: this film is a MUST for all the fans of Wim Sonneveld.",1047600000,5,414,5.0144927536231885
403137,5,6301977343,"After starring together in the movie ""Bandwagon"" (1953), Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse are back, better than ever! For lovers of musical/comedies, ""Silk Stockings"" is not to be missed!
When the Russian offficials find out that their beloved composer Peter Boroff (Wim Sonneveld) does not want to return to Russia after staying in Paris, they decide to take action. They send three comrades Bibinski (Jules Munshin), Brankov (Peter Lorre), and Ivanov (Joseph Buloff) to bring him back. But little do they realize that Boroff had secretly agreed to compose music for director Steve Canfield's (Fred Astaire) new Peggy Daiton (Janis Paige) movie. Steve then gets a plan to make a fake document saying that Boroff is actually half French! He easily convinces Bibinski, Brankov, and Ivanov to stay in Paris while settling the dispute of Boroff's nationality. Meanwhile the three Russians are having the time of their life smoking cigars, going to nightclubs, and enjoying themselves. The Russians take action by sending in envoy extraordinaire Ninotchka (Cyd Charisse) to once and for all bring by not only Boroff but also the other three comrades. Extremely cold and very 'Russian', Ninotchka is disgusted with the decadent Capitalistic Paris. But Steve who starts to fall in love with her, is determined to break her ice and to show her how to live... and to love.
Everything is just so totally fantastic about this movie! From the fun-loving Fred Astaire, the icy Cyd Charisse, the three bumbling and hilarious Munshin, Lorre, and Buloffe, and of course, who can forget Janis Paige in her very wacky and outgoing part as the swimstar actress, Peggy Daiton! And of course there are the musical numbers! Here are the dance numbers (Not in any order):
""All of You"": Beautiful number done by Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse. Steve certainly finds out that Ninotchka can really dance!
""Siberia"": Hilarious number done by the Russian trio! It's so amazing seeing Peter Lorre singing and dancing in a musical number! And he seems to be enjoying himself so much!
""Silk Stockings"": Cyd Charisse showcases her ballet talents in this very well done and beautiful dance.
""Red Blues"": Very fun song and dance with the seemingly dull Russians having a great time.
""Too Bad We Can't Go Back to Moscow"": I just love this song and Fred Astaire gets to dance with three Parisian girls who definitely know how to dance!
""Fated to Be Mated"": Another Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse dance number.
""Ritz Rollin' Rock"": There of course has to be a dance routine where Fred Astaire taps solo. And boy does he tap!
""Stereophonic Sound"": Janis Paige and Fred Astaire say the three qualities that are needed nowadays in movies.
""Satin and Silk"": Peggy Dainton is desperate to have Boroff's music made into popular songs. This is the number where she 'convinces' him.
""Josephine"": The popular song that is made from Boroff's music, ""Ode to a Tractors"". We never really get to hear the whole thing though.
Here are some of my other favorite musicals/comedies which I highly recommend. ""Take Me Out to the Ballgame"", ""Bandwagon"", ""Cover Girl"", ""Tea for Two"", ""Singin' in the Rain"", ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"", ""The Barkleys of Broadway"", the three ""That's Entertainment"" videos, and ""Guys and Dolls"". Of course there's plenty more!",1012176000,65,3302,5.016393442622951
403138,4,6301977343,"The film is a chic dancing exhibition which needs to be released, ASAP, on DVD!! From the first sequence (""Too Bad,"" which features Astaire with three young sirens- including future TV partner Barrie Chase), to the ""All of You"" seduction dance, to the ""Fated To Be Mated"" betrothal duet, it's one class act after another. (Only Astaire's solo ""The Ritz Roll and Rock"" dates a bit, but clench your teeth through it and you're fine.) The highlight for me (should you be wondering, or care) is Charisse's 'coming out' striptease to the title number. Beginning with a pair of stockings, she gets ready for her first date with Astaire (while falling under the spell of Paris), and displays classy sex appeal by whirling through her living room wearing only a camisole, earrings, and flared transparent slip. It has the distinction of being the final major musical film for both of its stars, and is a wonderful swan song to the musical film genre.",983145600,3,942,4.785276073619632

You'd think chilled borsch pulses in her veins. She is Ninotchka Yoschenko [Cyd Charisse], a lovely yet severe Soviet envoy sent to Paris to rescue wayward comrades from the perils of champagne and capitalism. But there may be a thaw in Nina's Cold War. She meets Steve Canfield [Fred Astaire], a smoothly brash American who won't take no for an answer.

Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse recapture the magic of their Band Wagon pairing in this musical based on the same-titled 1955 Broadway hit and the famed 1939 Greta Garbo comedy Ninotchka. Set to witty Cole Porter tunes, spiked with laughs, and featuring the two leads dancing the Eugene Loring/Hermes Pan choreography into timeless emotion, SILK STOCKINGS shows why elegance and fun never goes out of style.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: SILK STOCKINGS [1957] features Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse, plus the brilliant music of Cole Porter and comes off as a top-grade musical version of the 1939 Ninotchka film. Adapted from the 1955 Broadway musical adaptation of same genre and the film has two new Cole Porter songs and a total of 13 outstanding numbers. Fred Astaire enacts an American film producer in Paris who falls for the beautiful Communist when she arrives from Moscow to check on the activities of three Russian commissars.

SILK STOCKINGS again is a musical adaptation of Ninotchka and stars Cyd Charisse as Ninotchka Yoschenko, a Soviet Agent sent to Paris to retrieve three fellow agents and a composer who have found living in the city preferable to returning home. Steve Canfield [Fred Astaire] is eager to keep the composer in France to finish his film and gently persuades Ninotchka Yoschenko that Western decadence isn't all that bad. The film also stars George Tobias has a few good moments as the Communist chief and Janis Paige as Peggy.

When Ninotchka Yoschenko arrives, Steve Canfield figures he can dazzle her with the pleasures of Paris as well, taking her out on a hotel balcony and crooning ""Paris Loves Lovers.""  Our heroine isn't so easily swayed, sticking to her principles and interjecting them during the song's refrain. Ninotchka Yoschenko doesn't see a point in things that aren't industrially useful, but to Steve Canfield, those are the very things that give life purpose. Seeing the City of Lights in all its glory makes you feel alive and part of an extraordinary existence. It has romance and beauty and uniqueness spun into its very fabric and why else would Paris be used over and over for stories of transformation? If you can't find yourself there, you're in serious trouble, Hollywood seems to say.

Rouben Mamoulian in his deft direction maintains a flowing if over-long course. Musical numbers are bright, inserted naturally, and both Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse shine in dancing department, together and singly. Choreography is by Eugene Loring (others) and Hermes Pan (Fred Astaire numbers). Janis Paige shares top honours with the stars for a knock-em-dead type of performance.

A film like this naturally might rely on stereotypes, some of which are still very humorous. but some of which have grown stale over the years. Nevertheless, it's entertaining enough with the straight-laced Ninotchka Yoschenko providing a good foil to the rest of the eccentric company for much of the film. Jules Munshin is excellent as the leader of the three agents in Paris while Janis Paige shines in her role as actress Janis Paige and the strand of the narrative is that Peggy just disappears and I would have liked to see more of her at the end of the film, particularly after her show-stopping and quite literally, the brilliant number Josephine.

The songs in SILK STOCKINGS are not some of Cole Porter's best known but they are so fabulous and witty, enjoyable and beautifully choreographed. Satin and Silk is another Janis Paige number, and is really bouncy, though it has to be Stereophonic Sound and a duet by Fred Astaire and Janis Paige as they satirise the conventions of modern films, that steals the show. Cyd Charisse's singing is dubbed as usual, but her dancing is phenomenal, with her dance to the title song comparable to a religious experience in some ways. Cyd Charisse is utterly captivating, even if this is one of those films where Fred Astaire's age-gap relationships become slightly unsettling. Astaire himself is on-form with his dancing skills and wit and the cast works well together, even if the billing of Peter Lorre is a little generous considering the amount of time he's on screen.

Peter Lorre has a very small but memorable role as one of three Russian agents named Brankov [Peter Lorre], Bibinski [Jules Munshin] and Ivanov [Joseph Buloff] who dress alike and vary by about a foot in height. The three all fall for the charms of Paris, particular the women and in Peter Lorres case the Follies Bergre and develop a taste for champagne. Whether he lacked the dancing ability of the others in reality is not quite clear, yet his Cossack Dance complete with butter knife clamped between teeth while wedged and supported between a table and chair and is brilliantly unique.

SILK STOCKINGS is one of those films that I would have to classify as a perfect confection. Every frame of the film has an effortless, lighter than air quality that holds up to repeated viewings. Fred Astaire was the absolute master of the dance, who made each and every one of his partners look brilliant, maybe none more so than Cyd Charisse, the two of them together are absolute magic. Speaking of magic, the songs Cole Porters composed for SILK STOCKINGS find him at his effervescent best. I personally love Stereophonic Sound, Too Bad, Satin and Silk, Red Blues, All of You, Paris Loves Lovers and Siberia. The only thing about SILK STOCKINGS that may not fly as well as it once did, are the jokes pertaining to the Soviet Union of Russia. While those of my generation and older will find the material to be rather humorous, younger generations will probably be left scratching their heads at some of the references.

Elegant without being gaudy, graceful without being stuffy, gorgeous costumes, glorious in both CinemaScope and the awesome beautiful Color by Metrocolor and SILK STOCKINGS has it all and youll be singing the musical numbers for a long time afterwards. To put it simply, it is a pure joy: It is bright, beautiful full of toe-tapping numbers, a perfect gem of a film and an absolute pleasure from start to finish. SILK STOCKINGS is a true musical delight and amongst the many titles to be released under the new Warner Archive Collection banner. The Blu-ray disc presentations is absolutely first rate, and I doubt that SILK STOCKINGS has never looked this good since it was initially released on the inferior DVD release.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Warner Archive Collection has made SILK STOCKINGS available for the first time on this Blu-ray in a brilliant 1080p encoded Metrocolor image that is truly marvellous looking and especially an exceptional 2.40:1 aspect ratio presentation that has  been enhanced to look fantastic on your Widescreen display. The film element used for the transfer is in excellent shape, displaying very few minor blemishes and little perceivable grain. The image itself is relatively sharp and rather nicely defined and especially the brilliant colours by. For the most part, the hues have a very pleasant pastel tone, while the flesh tones have a uniformity best associated with a makeup man's kit. Stronger colours are present from time to time and appear completely stable, without noise or smearing. Blacks appear accurate, whites are clean and contrast is generally smooth. Depth of field is pretty good considering the CinemaScope lenses of the style in which the film was photographed to show off the wide screen process. So overall it is a very good video presentation.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Warner Archive Collection release of SILK STOCKINGS has been upgraded to a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack. Although the recordings are circa 1957, fidelity is pretty nice, lacking harshness in the higher frequencies and a decent bottom end. The music and musical numbers have nice stereo imaging, as well as providing a wraparound effect in the rear channels, especially with the musical number Stereophonic Sound. Dialogue is very cleanly rendered, although one will notice an immediate acoustical difference between the spoken dialogue and song lyrics that come within an instant of one another, but despite this, overall it is also a very good audio experience.

Having said this, the very visible aging of the dancing star does not in the least reflect on his matchless dancing skills, for he was, in this film as in all his other ones absolutely peerless and unchallenged by ANY dancer in his elegant style, frequently a mixture of balletic grace and modern dance creativity. He does not seem to me to be tired in his acting scenes but extremely tactful and even somewhat embarrased at his romantic moments with Cyd Charisse, whose freshness and beauty offered a remarkable contrast to his aged persona. But his personality, style and professionalism shine through; just as Charisse's beauty and polished Russian accent do. It must be added, in this viewer's opinion, that Charisse was arguably the best dancing partner Astaire ever had, this side of Eleanor Powell and Rita Hayworth. (With all due respect to the enchanting and multi talented Ginger Rogers, far more brilliant as a comedienne than she was as a dancer).

Lorre is a special delight: Charisse exclaims on the DVD docu track that he almost steals the movie.

403333,4,6301977343,"... at least once every two years.""  So wrote Bosley Crowther, movie critic for the NEW YORK TIMES, back in 1957 when this movie was released.  Crowther had had in mind Astaire and Charisse's prior musical pairing, in 1953's THE BAND WAGON, another MGM release and a superb movie musical directed by Vincente Minnelli, that is now considered a classic.  This SILK STOCKINGS was based on the eponymous Broadway musical by Cole Porter (1955) starring Don Ameche and Hildegard Knef (""Neff"" in Americanese),  which itself was a musicalization of MGM's comedy NINOTCHKA (1939).  And that picture was yet another classic out of MGM starring Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas, directed by Ernst Lubitsch, advertised as ""the movie that kids the Commies.""  The plot is virtually the same whether musicalized or not, stage or screen:  three Soviet *Apparatchiks*, deputed to Paris, so fell in love with the City of Light's climate, enhanced standard of living and general sense of hedonism that they refused to return to the U.S.S.R.  Enter ""Ninotchka,"" a grim and humorless sub-Commissar, to haul them home.  Yet the same Paris that seduced the three Soviet men also seduces Ninotchka, not to mention the well-heeled hedonist (or ""Capitalist oppressor"" if you will) who falls in love with her.

This MGM production, out of Arthur Freed's unit and directed by Rouben Mamoulian (famed for his elegant Parisian movies), cast Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse in the Ameche/Knef roles to emphasize dancing, and of course Astaire and Charisse were MGM vets from way back.  Probably the most charming dance sequence in the movie is a scene in which Charisse and Astaire's characters ""accidentally"" stumble upon a prop room in a French movie studio and dance a duet to a swing instrumental version of the show's best-known song, ""All Of You.""  Fred had already sung the lyrics to Cyd earlier in the film:

""I love the looks of you / The lure of you / I'd love to make a tour of you. . .""

These two dancing pros, at the top of their profession, are relaxed, confident and utterly charming.  There are other charming sequences, too, including the casting of Peter Lorre in one of his later roles.  By that time Lorre could barely dance but he mugs so engagingly it doesn't matter.

The role of comedy in this movie is a little too restricted, in my opinion, to make way for extended song and dance sequences, many of which are lovely but all of which are long.  As to the matter of production values, sometimes too much of a good thing can be slightly regrettable.  Timely help comes from a song sung by Janis Paige in this film, whose character was a take-off on Esther Williams, in Paris to make her first ""dry"" movie:

""If you want to hear applauding hands resound, You've got to have Glorious Technicolor / Breathtaking CinemaScope / and Stereophonic Sound.""  (song ""Stereophonic Sound"")

In SILK STOCKINGS, the sound is fine but the CinemaScope seems to me a matter more of technological marvelry than utter necessity:  it's the 2.35:1 aspect, very wide, and while veteran director Mamoulian took to it well, it seems a little ostentatious and of course will play on your TV (any kind) best only with considerable letter-boxing.  The MGM folks of that era, adept in the use of that glorious Technicolor, perhaps got carried away with its possibility for symbolism:  early Ninotchka's clothing is noticeable for having no color at all, while putative rival Janis Paige's wardrobe is a tacky, mock ""Hollywood"" effusion of coral and turquoise, and the deluxe suites used to portray Paris's top hotels are so understated and color-coordinated that rather than recede behind the players, as they should, they call attention to themselves by their luxurious but ostentatiously minimalist palette.

I certainly understand that SILK STOCKINGS is many people's favorite film musical.  I admit it is quite worthy, and I had no trouble seeing it for the third time, but I can't quite stretch to give it the five stars I feel other MGM movies in the same vein deserve:

403374,4,6301977343,"MGM's production of ""Silk Stockings"" was vastly superior to the second rate Cole Porter Broadway musical on which it was based, to a great extent because the leading lady, Hildegarde Neff, could neither sing nor dance. Of course, Charisse is dubbed, as she always was, though her very infrequent stage appearances proved that the voice was on key, but too faint unless she was miked heavily. But the lady could sure dance. 'Dancing in the Dark' in :""The Bandwagon"" also with Astaire, and the best musical ever made, is the most romantic moment on film, bar none. But the title song, as danced here by Charisse is as beautiful a number  as she has ever filmed.  (I have to block out 'One Alone' from ""Deep in My Heart"" as James Mitchell, finally given a chance to dance in an MGM musical, actually steals the number from her no matter how good she is.) Janis Paige is a hoot as a 'dumb' Esther Williams - Williams was not dumb. But Paige is great. And who would have thought that Peter Lorre would make such a good comedian?
Astaire and Charisse are perfection together - they always were. But Astaire's final solo should have been dumped before filming. It is the only clunker in the movie's score - the worst of the Broadway show was long gone. He does what he can with it, but it is a losing cause as the song, 'The Ritz Rock and Roll' was dated when it was filmed and has become a pathetic piece of film now.
Otherwise, they are magic- but not 'Dancing in the Dark' magic, which surpassed anything Astaire performed with any of his other leading ladies. Yes, including Ginger.
For fun, watch Charisse's skirt become a skort, and then a skirt and then.....with really no reason except that the censor board must have hovered over the set making sure that neither the title song nor Paige's 'Silk and Satin' went beyond their limited line.  They both did. Never underestimate Arthur Freed when he was determined to get around them.

Fred Astaire plays Fred Astaire as usual, ( I am more of a fan of Gene Kelly), but Janis Paige, marvellous as she is, has to play a character which has similarities with the actress who needed elocution lessons in ""Singing in the Rain"". There were a few moments when I detected, in her eyes, a hint of Melina Mercouri's style, and this makes me feel that she could have brought more depth to her part.
Her songs, satirical ""Stereofonic Sound"" and lingerical ""Satins and Silks"" are perfect for her character, but they did not impact on me as I had remembered from years ago.

For those of you who are unfamiliar with the story, it's about a movie producer, Steve Canfield (Fred Astaire) who is using the music of a Russian composer to produce a film in Paris, France. Three Russian envoys are sent to convince the composer to return to France, but they get caught up in the beauty and life of Paris. Another envoy, a woman, Ninotchka Yoschenko, played by Cyd Charisse, is sent to bring the four Russians home. Her serious demeanor is met by equal attempts to woo her by Steve Canfield. Eventually the woman is won over by the city and the man. All goes wrong, however, when Canfield turns the composer's classic music into popular music for the production. Insulted, all the Russian nationals return home. Once home, all letters from Canfield to Yoschenko are censored by the Russian goverment. Eventually, the original three envoys are sent back to Paris and Yoschenko must return to retrieve them again. Once in Paris, she realizes that Canfield wants to marry her, therefore keeping her from returning to Russia. It's a beautiful happy ending with LOTS of musical numbers, comedy, and romance.

Nina is sent from Moscow to check up on three Russian emissaries, delightfully played by Peter Lorre, Jules Munshin and Joseph Buloff, who fall into wicked capitalist ways, to which Nina also eventually succumbs, with Janis Paige in a supporting role. The Russian commissar is played effectively by George Tobias in the film, in the earlier stage version and in the 1939 film. Didn't I mention already? The music is by Cole Porter. While most of the tunes were not `standards', they were entirely appropriate vehicles for the spectacular dance numbers and the script has all the comedy of the original film.

403494,5,6301977343,"This is possibly one of the last musicals in the old M-G-M studio tradition and one of their first in CinemaScope. Fred is no longer a kid, but his grace, class, charm, and style is just as fresh as always. People tend to forget that Fred was also one of the screens top leading men, I think because he didn't fit the standard mold of the time. The lovely, Cyd Charisse, makes for a wonderful dancing partner in this their second go round since ""The Band Wagon"" a few years earlier.
The story is a musical version of ""Ninotchka"", a cold war story involving a young Soviet envoy, Miss Charisse as Ninotchka, going to Paris to bring back three bumbling comrades (who have fallen in love with the ""decadent"" city), and a famous Russian composer, who thinks his music is being used in a serious cinematic musical remake of ""War And Peace"". It's really being transformed into a big brassy musical that stars the wonderful Janis Paige as Peggy Dayton.
Ninotchka's idea of a good time is inspecting steel mills! Once she meets Astaire, who plays producer, Steve Canfield, sparks begin to fly and we're in for a treat with great songs and musical numbers by the great Cole Porter!
There are four standout musical numbers in this film, the romantic ""All Of You"", the sexy and character transforming ""Silk Stockings"" ballet that is beautifully performed by Cyd which also showcases those gorgeous legs, and ""Fated To Be Mated"" with Fred and Cyd dancing to both traditional and jazz choreography. And finally, ""The Red Blues"" in which Miss Charisse dances to music incorporating ballet, jazz, and traditional Russian folk dance. All in all a delightful film!

403501,4,6301977343,"With the passing of Cyd Charisse last week at age 86, it's worth seeking out what is probably her finest work on celluloid. Granted as an actress, she was bland, and as a singer, she was dubbed (this time by the sonorous-sounding Carol Richards). But as a dancer, she was extraordinary. Along with Vera-Ellen, the ballet-trained Charisse was in the top echelon of the female dancers that MGM showcased during the studio's golden years of which this film is one of its final stops. The clearest evidence of this claim can be found in the title tune when she dances with beauty and precision elegantly changing from her drab street clothes into silk and satin. It's a remarkable number, no small feat since her co-star is Fred Astaire. Directed by early musical maven Rouben Mamoulian (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Me-Tonight/dp/B0000UX4V2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Me Tonight</a>) in what turned out to be his last film, the movie also marks Astaire's swan song as a musical comedy leading man. Symbolically, he smashes his top hat at the end of his final solo number, ""The Ritz Roll and Rock"". The wear barely shows in his dancing where he pulls off some of his most acrobatic numbers, but other than the professionalism of the two leads, the inspiration seems sadly missing.

The film is a partial remake of Ernst Lubitsch's 1939 classic comedy,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ninotchka/dp/B0009S4IJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ninotchka</a>&nbsp;- in fact, some scenes are repeated verbatim - although certain elements have been altered to accommodate Cole Porter's musical score. This musical translation first showed up on Broadway two years earlier, but further revisions have obviously been made to tailor the story to the dancing talents of the leads. Charisse has the unenviable task of stepping into Greta Garbo's shoes as top Soviet envoy Ninotchka Yoschenko, who is sent to Paris to retrieve three lesser envoys swept up by the City of Lights. They had already botched their mission to lure famous Russian composer Peter Boroff back to the mother country. At the same time, American movie producer Steve Canfield wants Boroff to score his next picture, a musical bowdlerization of Tolstoy's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/War-and-Peace/dp/0307266931/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">War and Peace</a>&nbsp;starring comically curvaceous Peggy Dayton, a parody of an Esther Williams-style swimming star whose been in the pool too long. As Dayton uses her feminine wiles to entice Boroff, Canfield tries to seduce Ninotchka, a far frostier proposition though the eventual thawing is inevitable. Porter's music tends to have that effect or so we're led to believe.

Playing another variation on the worldly photographer he played in the same year's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Funny-Face/dp/B000RZIGUO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Funny Face</a>, Astaire is still at the top of his game, but his dance numbers are less elegant and appear markedly shorter than usual here. Charisse cannot compare to the legendary Garbo when it comes to line readings as a stoic communist. However, her dancing truly transcends - not only the title tune but also ""The Red Blues"", an impressive ensemble number showcasing Charisse in a variety of dance styles, and the two duets with Astaire to ""All of You"" - the first a romantic defrosting of Ninotchka and the second a jauntier, rhythmic pas-de-deux. I wish the rest of the film was as good, but sadly, the energy wavers and the pacing flags during its 117-minute running time. The rest of the cast is serviceable, in particular, Janis Paige on familiar ground as Peggy (nicely paired with Astaire on the energetically cynical ""Stereophonic Sound"") and George Tobias as the deadpan Soviet commissar. Peter Lorre (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/M/dp/B00065GX64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">M</a>) and Jules Munshin (Ozzie in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-the-Town/dp/B00143XE1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On the Town</a>) show up as two of the bumbling envoys. The 2003 DVD has some interesting extras beginning with a ten-minute short featuring a 2003 interview with the still-elegant Charisse in ""Cole Porter in Hollywood: Satin and Silk"". Because of the Porter tie-in, there is also a 1934 Bob Hope short, ""Paree, Paree"", a silly musical comedy with Hope wooing singer Dorothy Stone.

Dancers are Tybee Afra as Fifi (dark hair in red dress), Barrie Chase as Gabrielle (brunette in gold dress and long gloves), Betty Uitti as Suzette (the blonde in the dropped-waist beautiful dress).

Tybee is from Cuba and this Latina definitely has the cha-cha moves. Sadly she passed away in 1982. Barrie went on to be Fred Astaire's TV program partner. No other info on Betty.

What also makes this dance very spectacular are the beautiful dresses wore by Tybee, Barrie, and Betty. Such fashions are no longer seen in Hollywood these days which illustrate how much women's fashions have gone downhill since then. Compared to this, dance routines on VH1 these days are boring.

403563,5,6301977343,"This is the last musical Fred Astaire made and he did go out on a high note with this musical remake of Ninotchka.  Fred Astaire is up to his usually high standard. His numbers with Cyd Charisse are sheer perfection.  I agree with one of the early reivewers of this film who called for congress to mandate Astaire and Charisse to make a film every two years. Along with Astaire and Charisse, there is also Janis Page who steals every scene that is not nailed down (and sometimes even then).

While the plot of the movie is meant to follow that of the old Melvin Douglas Greta Garbo movie, this movie is a departure in many ways. First of all instead of a cache of jewels, the two protagonists argue over a Soviet composer, is he Russian or is he French.  This sets things in motion. Since the jewels are out, so is the Countess Swana, instead there Janis Page who plays a kind of Esther Williams swimming musical star, Peggy Dayton who is trying to grow professionally by playing Empress Josephine in a crazy film version of ""War and Peace"" which apparently is not about ""War and Peace.""  She is not so much a rival for Cyd Charisse, but a frequent and wonderful distraction.  Her numbers like ""Silk and Satin"" and ""Stereophnic Sound"" are wonderful.  The funniest number is ""Ritz Roll and Rock"" in which Fred Astaire attempts to get down in a kind of pastiche of teen rock and roll musical numbers popular at the time.

This is an excellent movie, loads of fun, with stand out performances by all concerned.",1205712000,,1507,4.4945054945054945
403564,4,6301977343,"If they advertised Ninotchka with the immortal ad-line 'Garbo laughs!', they should have plugged this musical remake with the legend 'Lorre Dances!' The human goldfish shares two musical numbers as one of three Russian commissars sent after a runaway Russian composer who, horror of horrors, is considering composing the score for an American picture to be shot in Paris.

If his dancing is amusingly underwhelming, most of the rest of the numbers are in the charge of Fred Astaire as the playboy producer of Janis Paige's 'first non-swimming picture' - War and Peace (well, a bit of it). ""How do you feel about Tolstoy?"" ask the gentlemen of the press. ""There's absolutely no truth to the rumours, we're just good friends,"" she replies between smacking the water out of her ears. Ninotchka (Charisse), the humourless Russian commissar they send after their original commissars, takes a more disapproving view. ""This is an American  picture. You're liable to have Napoleon win."" Even if you haven't seen the original, it's  not hard to guess which two characters fall in love.

Nonetheless, the film is surprisingly entertaining for a later MGM musical (Fred Astaire's last at the studio). Cole Porter delivers a strong score (minus the lyrics to the title number, here used as background to Charisse's big dance solo), Janis Paige delivers a more streetwise variation of Jean Hagen's dumb blonde from Singin' in theRain and the script delivers plenty of digs at the movies in general (""You know what prestige means?"" ""Yeah, pictures that don't make money.""), CinemaScope in particular and Communism as a matter of course (""Get me a copy of 'Who's Still Who.'"").

Mamoulian doesn't always know how to handle the Scope frame, ruining a potentially priceless early joke where Lorre coaches his comrades to smile by shooting only the back of his head and not making best use  of the frame in Janis Paige and Fred Astaire's number celebrating 'Glorious Technicolor, Breathtaking CinemaScope and Stereophonic Sound', but elsewhere uses it well enough to make this widescreen version a particular treat if you've only seen the fullframe video or TV versions (the Russkies may have sent three commissars after Borov, but you'd only ever see two at one time on those!). The print used could have done with a bit more remastering but it's more than acceptable and there's a good range of extras - a 2003 behind-the-scenes featurette with Charisse, trailer, a weak early Bob Hope short Paree, Paree with Cole Porter score and and Scope short of the MGM Symphony Orchestra playing The Poet and The Peasant Overture.",1198886400,,2604,5.044186046511628

At age 57, Astaire is still a dazzling, graceful performer, while Charisse ably fills Garbo's shoes. Peter Lorre, in a rare comic turn, even vamps his way through the rollicking ""Siberia.""

This is one of those films, and I'm enjoying following their recommendations as opposed to just clicking on TCM or AMC and seeing whatever's on.

But that doesn't mean I always agree with those recommendations.  I'm not particularly a fan of this genre, so it takes something really special to appeal to me.  If this describes you too, skip ""Silk Stockings"" and go directly to Fred & Ginger's earlier films ""Top Hat"" and ""Swing Time.""  Although this film with Fred & Cyd Charisse has its moments (Janis Paige gets some laughs, Charisse has a terrific solo dance number where her dour Communist character finally gets into those silk stockings, and this is the only place you'll ever see Peter Lorre sing and dance), ultimately it just drags.  One could never say that about the above-mentioned Fred & Ginger classics.

Even the score by the legendary Cole Porter has zero memorable tunes...again, unless this type of film is your cup of tea, in which case it'll appeal to you.  As for me, by the final half-hour I was continually amazed the film wasn't over yet, as another scene and then yet another scene started up while I was hoping for ""The End.""  And it's actually surprising to me to find that this film is considered a comedy; other than Paige, I got zero laughs out of it.  And Astaire, now middle-aged in 1957, is a shadow of his former self.  Ultimately I just shut it off before the ending because I was falling asleep, so even though the film has its moments I give it only one star.

403567,4,6301977343,"Fred Astaire has always been a performer who's work is very close to my heart. The last real Fred Astaire movie (excluding his geriatric non-singing, non-dancing or non-starring roles) is 1957's ""Silk Stockings"".

I was a little afraid to watch Silk Stockings at first. Sure, it had a Cole Porter score supervised by Andre Previn, and Hermes Pan choreography, and, sure, Fred made fabulous movies even at that age (""the Bandwagon"", ""Daddy Long Legs""), but I knew it was Fred's last, and I didn't want to know why. Now I know what a pleasure I was depriving myself of.

""Silk Stockings"" is a musical remake of ""Ninotchka"",  a 1939 Greta Garbo picture. It's about a serious stern young  russian woman, sent as an envoy to nab a russian composer living illegally in Paris. The composer is betraying his russian classical heritage by writing music for a low brow movie musical. The director of this movie, played by Fred Astaire, distracts the pretty young russian (Cyd Charisse) with the wonders of Paris, classy night clubs, and dancing to jazz. In falling for him, her strict heartless personality melts away.

This movie was produced at the height of the cold war, and the height of Hollywood blacklisting, and it's commie-bashing could make some uncomfortable. To me, those jokes are anything but propaganda. The cultural stereotypes are played for laughs, and should be taken with a grain of salt. Of course, I'm a big fan of the top hat and tails ritzy romantic culture that Astaire's character teaches Charisse's character the joys of, so it's easy for me to say.

With the exception of the classics ""All of You"" and ""Paris is For Lovers"", Cole Porter's songs are comic, here. But, that being said, they are hilarious. This was towards the end of Porter's career too. Infact, this was towards the end of the movie musical as America knew it.

Rock and Roll was taking over. To me, the most moving moments in this movie are not the dramatic love scenes shared by Astaire and Charisse, they are the self referential moments, where Porter, Astaire, and choreographer Hermes Pan acknowledge that their era in over.

Porter wrote special material just for this movie. One highlight is a tune called ""Stereophonic Sound"". In it, the singer quips about how moviegoers used to be content to see talented performers do their thing, and a nice love story, but these days all they want is ""glorious Technicolor, breathtaking CinemaScope, and Stereophonic sound!"" The song puts down all the gimmickry of the modern Hollywood, and even has one verse quite obviously about Fred Astaire himself. Porter writes that these days a great hoofer in tails is not enough, they want a ballet (alluding to Gene Kelly's ballet dance number fad).

Fred Astaire's last MGM dance number is to the song ""Ritz Rollin' Rock"". It's Porter's parody of this new music called Rock and Roll, ironically borrowing from Irving Berlin's dated ""Puttin' On the Ritz"". This sequence, choreographed by Astaire's long-time collaborator Hermes Pan, ends with Fred writhing on the floor, wearing his 1930's tails and top hat. As the horns hit the last big chord, Fred removes his trade-marked top hat and smashes it flat with his fist.

The message Porter, Astaire and Pan slipped into this novelty number, is very powerful, if you know what you're seeing.

Pop entertainment changed in the sixties, and the the old kings abdicated their thrones to... well... the King, I suppose.

Anyway, if you're a Fred-head like me, and you're afraid to see Fred's final fling, ""Silk Stockings"", don't be. You'll be reminded why he and his period of Hollywood was great.",1109548800,10,3616,4.890522875816994

Fred was 58 years old in 1957, but his dancing was still as graceful and vigorous and elegant as in 1935 when he was 22 years younger and made the great Top Hat with Ginger. You'll read many reviewers rating ""The Band Wagon"" as a 4-star musical, but Silk Stockings is very much the better film: for one thing, Rouben Mamoulian was by far a better director than Vincente Minelli, and for another, Hermes Pan's dance arrangements for Astaire were always the best.

Anthony Lane wrote (last year in the New Yorker): ""...If you believe in musicals, then your mind will turn helplessly to another bench, and another couple, at the close of day: Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse, in Central Park, in The Band Wagon (1953). Their every step, and every touch of his hand upon hers, was done without flaw, and the synchronicity spoke not only of twin souls but of a heavenly ideal...(If I were exiled or marooned, and could take only a four-minute clip of any movie to keep me company, that would be my choice.)""

Well,--that was a very memorable number indeed, but to my mind it was certainly surpassed by Fred & Cyd's initial dance in Silk Stockings--Astaire gently coaxing ""Ninotchka"" to dance with him, and then watching her gradually, inevitably, permit herself to be swept up into that moment: glorious to see.  Beautiful synchronicity indeed: everything she does with Astaire is perfection.

Like Ann Miller, Cyd was a tremendously talented dark-haired Texas gal who got regularly got passed over at MGM by perky light-haired inferior-talented actresses.  It is scarcely believable that she had polio as a little girl.  Her beauty was truly deep and mysterious because at one moment she could look so severe and cold, and in the next moment when you see her smile it's as though the sun just burst through the midnight darkness and suddenly lit up the entire planet.  In her final dance number--""Red Blues""--she's having so much fun you'll see that radiant smile beaming all through her fabulous moves.  Beautiful Cyd Charisse--only 35 years old here--dancing so beautifully, so spectacularly.  I'll admit that I'm unable to watch such beauty in a dance number like that without being brought close to tears.
