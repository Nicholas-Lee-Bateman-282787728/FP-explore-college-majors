1797285,5,B0000714A9,"Benny Hill is a comic genius.

This collection so far out of all of the DVD's I own, has the BEST skit/episode compliation yet. I can't tell you how hard I laughed during the first viewing. It brought back memories of my teen years. However this time, I understood a lot more of the humorous things he said.

If you like Benny Hill, then this is THE collection you MUST have.

I have not seen some of these episodes in over 20 years, and I'll tell you, they are even MORE funny now! The comic Genius of Benny Hill has staying power, and will continue to be funny decades from now.

If you don't have this particular compilation - GET IT!",1109376000,8,637,4.239669421487603
1797286,5,B0000714A9,"Benny Hill holds a special place in my heart. I used to watch it on channel 9-WOR TV here in NYC (about 20 years prior to the UPN age)..boy oh boy! that  channel and tv in general has really changed But then at time I could always look forward to watching Benny Hill at about 730...I used to get all happy when the Big Ben-Thames logo would pop up and then the do-doo-do-doo theme would play. Then it was on...I'd look at Grampa and then Benny would hit that baldguy on his head and then i'd pat my grampas head...that chase was always the best i used to drive my grandmother nuts running all around the house like a little lunatic...jumping on the bed and all that good stuff...yep i used to make believe I was getting chased around by Benny and crew too. Benny Hill was a happy childhood memory. May you Rest in Peace Mr. Hill, thankyou for keeping me laughing all these years.",1092787200,6,879,4.295180722891566
1797287,5,B0000714A9,"It's been said that ""a clown makes you laugh at him; a genius makes you laugh at yourself.""  I've always found this a rather narrow-minded view; it's quite possible to be both.  Red Skelton & Benny Hill were two such examples.  Indeed, one could call Benny Hill ""The British Red Skelton.""  We of the English-speaking world spit on our clowns & mimes too much; we'd do well to take an example from the French & Italians (check out Fellini's awesome '71 documentary, ""The Clowns"").

TV comedy had two great auteurs: Ernie Kovacs & Benny Hill.  By ""auteur,"" I mean both had complete ability to time, pace & frame a good pantomime sight-gag.  But at the risk of being a Benedict Arnold to my fellow Americans, I have to say Benny Hill's achievements outstrip Kovacs'--if mainly for the reason Kovacs died too young.  Both men literally drank themselves to death: Kovacs, while driving home drunk from a party; Hill, from ITV's cancellation of his 21-year-old show, represented in the present volume.....his enforced early retirement had him smoking, eating, and drinking himself to death.

Forget Rowan Atkinson; he's a rank amateur compared with Hill's acumen for laugh-till-you-cry, uproarious slapstick entertainment.  Here are the classic sketches that solidified his reputation.....""Charlene's Angels""; ""Super-Teech""; ""Horny Boy-Scout Picnic""; ""Hill's Angels: New York, New York""; ""Hill's Angels: Enough Is Enough""; ""The Stripper Clown""; ""Clown & Ballerina""; ""Wonder Granny Vs. Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde""; ""Mr. Chow Mein: Chinese Opera Company""; ""Hill's Angels: Pleasure Cruise""; ""The Gay Caballero""; ""Benny's Place""; ""Hill's Angel's: Workout!""; ""The Brat With His Slingshot""; ""The Scarlet Pimple""; and many more.

But, by way of an open letter to Thames TV/HBO Video: PLEASE, people, may we have a DVD release of the great Hill sketches that NEVER made it onto home video?......Gems like ""Foreign TV Commercial Goof-Ups""; ""Wonder Granny Vs. Count Dracula""; ""Mr. Chow Mein: Kung Fu Movie Director""; ""Leprechaun Television (The Irish Independent TV Station)""; ""Eurovision Song Contest""; ""Lovely Lulubelle (The W.C.Fields Song)""; ""Charlie's 92nd Birthday Celebration""; ""The Woodstick Music Fair""; ""Tex Cymbal, Rock Star""; and lots more??",1085529600,16,2232,5.459302325581396
1797288,5,B0000714A9,"Having read so many reports of Golden Greats and Golden Classics I was in 2 minds which to buy first. I found Greats for under $20US,so bought it first. It is quality Benny but as stated on several reviews it contains material from the 1980-1989 period. This is later Benny with strong Hills Angels and young kids participation . This week I got Classics from a vendor in Canada. Now this is really good! Some excellent sketches from the late 70's- much better fayre in my view.
And Jane Leeves is in more than just the Gay Caballero as some reviews would have you think. E.g. The Oven Glove and a doctor's sketch.
I'd buy this first everytime.",1085529600,14,644,4.466101694915254

7973438,4,B0000714A9,"The one star reduction is simply based on the most ironic twist ever. I am an American who adores British comedy (Spike Milligan, Morecambe & Wise, etc.) and Benny Hill was a British comedian who tried to appeal more to an American audience. Don't get me wrong, many of the gags are side-splittingly funny, as are the silent bits with lots of slapstick. The price for the amount of material you get is INSANE, no complaints there, either. Love seeing Bob Todd in another show besides the Spike Milligan 'Q' series, too. My only issue is that the humor lacks subtlety, which is what appeals to me about true 'British comedy'.",1462147200,,624,4.63063063063063
7973439,5,B0000714A9,Good skits.  I have always found Benny Hill funny.  I am having trouble finding any dvds with the skits he did as a little boy.  He says a word with an accent that sounds very bad and then the people come up with the correct word.  Always loved his little boy but has not been on any the the Benny Hill dvds I have gotten.  But still love the humor.,1373241600,,349,3.9285714285714284
7973440,5,B0000714A9,"I am a huge fan of British Comedy and Benny Hill is one of its great proponents.  It is difficult to dislike anything about this set for it contains a lot of his greatest skits.
Highly recommended to anyone who would like an introduction to modern day slapstick",1365811200,,261,4.4375

7973443,5,B0000714A9,"What more can I say when it is Benny Hill there is NOTHING than can sell then man better than himself.  This is vintage very funny stuff which I can remember in some cases and was completely new to me in others.  I was amazed to find sketches of Benny's which I hadn't seen previously and that was a real bonus.  This is not an expensive DVD but you won't regret the money spent on it.  It is already in my ""do not lend you won't get it back"" DVD collection and there it will stay.

Great stuff, he was and is the best in the business.",1250899200,2,535,3.9626168224299065
