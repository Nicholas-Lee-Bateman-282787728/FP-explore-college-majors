8325121,5,B000GETUUG,"Although Belker tends to mumble sometimes and fly through some of his explanations as if you should already know how to do many things (which does help, by the way, this is not for a total beginner --some regular photoshop familiarity helps immensely in understanding what Belker is doing), overall the series is excellent in training the novice to punch through to that next level that may enable them to present professionally-appearing digital renderings.

It is suggested to get the whole set of these instructions as the information overlaps with the first beginning DVD offering excellent but simple techniques to help loosen up the design process in an anxiety-free excercise that even I have already benefited from (and I am a professional).

Regardless if you are a fan of Belker's work or not, his teachings are beneficial to any artist searching for a new way of working that can impart great strength and enhanced work flow into the personal tastes and styles of anyone. Highly recommended.",1189900800,,1002,5.030120481927711
