8111750,3,B000ENZDXC,"Very enjoyable Martin Kane TV episodes, 2 with William Gargan and 2 with Mark Stevens.  The shows themselves are in good shape with no splices, have the original commercials, and are complete.  This would be a great release if not for the poor transfer.  Critics Choice continues its practice of putting out transfers that are even worse than Alpha's.",1245456000,,351,4.915254237288136
