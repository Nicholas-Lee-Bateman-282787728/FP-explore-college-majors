8390295,4,B003757R88,"I picked up a copy of this romcom because it features Aure Atika in her late 20s (her work from that long ago being difficult to find on DVD). Not only is Atika as cute as a bug on Hello Kitty's nose, but Judith Godrche costars as her new BFF (Godrche, like Atika, is a goddess of the screen). Anyway, on to the plot: I'll only describe the beginning so as not to spoil the [all too obvious] ending.

Godrche plays Ccile Bussy, an anthropology student at l'universit de Nice who is doing her thesis on a tribe in the Brazilian Amazon that hadn't made contact with the outside world prior to Ccile finding them. Bimboland opens with a jungle scene [shot in Mexico, judging by the closing credits] of Ccile returning to ""her"" tribe. Much to her chagrin, the tribe has experienced ""rapid modernization"" since her first visit: the men are cutting down trees with chainsaws to make way for ""civilization,"" and a tribal woman offers Ccile a chilled cola.

Upon returning to university, Ccile finds that her thesis no longer holds water because of this development. The new head of her dept., Laurent Gaspard (who happens to nearly run her over in his Jeep before they formally meet), tells Ccile to pick a novel group for her ethnography. Back in the dorm when she is chatting with a couple of pals, one of them throws the term ""bimbo"" into the conversation. Ccile and the other girl look at her quizzically, and the friend explains, while holding two beefsteak tomatoes in front of her chest and screwing up her face: ""C'est amricain. Une jolie fille, pas spcialement fute.""
Haha, that's about right. Anyway, after Ccile meets Aure Atika's character Alex and builds some rapport, Ccile realizes this may be a ""bimbo,"" and decides that Alex will be her ""in"" for anthropologically observing the topic of her new thesis: bimbos.

Ccile, who is considered too much of a bookworm by Laurent, goes undercover as a bimbo at a nightclub, assuming an alter ego as ""Brigitte."" Laurent runs into her at the club and falls for her, not knowing Brigitte is Ccile. Thus begins the chase, and you can pretty much guess how this turns out. We also meet Alex's jet set lover Greg, played by the wonderful French actor / filmmaker Dany Boon. This is a genuinely funny movie, although it suffers from the heavy-handed gender trappings typical of romcom flicks (which undoubtedly will turn some viewers off).

Not much to complain about here, from my perspective; for dudes like me who don't visit Nice, we can at least fantasize about hanging out in that beautiful Mediterranean area, and also ogle the gorgeous actresses from afar.

NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES. Thankfully this DVD includes the option French subtitles, which I find helpful since my French is ""rusty"" (to say the least).",1444435200,,2757,4.735416666666667
