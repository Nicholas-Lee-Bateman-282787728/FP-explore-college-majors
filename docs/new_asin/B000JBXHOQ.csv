Instead of the riveting documentary that I had seen this was nothing of the sort.  Bland and boring, the information is alright, but nothing exciting.",1341532800,,314,5.0
8149546,3,B000JBXHOQ,"This video provides a very basic background to Google.  As mentioned in another review, the visuals are distracting.  The editors had about 10% of the actual video footage needed for the narration, and they made up the rest with poorly chosen stock footage.  Overall, I was disappointed.  I don't think it would hold the interest of a high school class, which was my intended audience.",1312070400,3,385,4.876923076923077
8149547,5,B000JBXHOQ,"This DVD total run time is 55 minutes.  This DVD along with the FACEBOOK DVD made for some educational viewing.  I had no idea these inventors were simply computer users who wanted something faster and easier.

Honestly I really thought Google was designed by some engineer at a computer company
and I thought the same about Face book too.

Awesome DVD",1290816000,,352,4.721311475409836
8149548,5,B000JBXHOQ,"Phenomenal A&E Biography DVD on Sergey Brin and Larry Page.

You will get an insider look at the start up and growth of Google by taking a view from within the Googleplex in Mountain View, California.

The best part about this DVD is that it provides an excellent education on Google's Search Technology as well as how pay per click advertising works with Google Adwords. There are a few segments of businesses that have grown their online sales with Google Adwords PPC Advertising.

Have a great day and add this DVD to your collection - You'll be Happy You Did!

8149550,1,B000JBXHOQ,"Looks like the work of an ameture! Only a few poeple remotely related to Google were interviewed. There were bizzare video clips ... for instance when the author was saying something like ""... there was a long road ahead of Google, they will actually show the picture of a highway"". Extremely disappointing overall.",1176854400,9,315,4.962264150943396
