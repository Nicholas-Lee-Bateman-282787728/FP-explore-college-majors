4777776,3,B005LAII4E,"Let's be clear that ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"" is an action movie based on a comic book and a toy action figure.  It features virtually non-stop action, some terrific special effects, and a comic book plot.  This is not ""Patton"" or ""The Ten Commandments"" or even ""Die Hard.""  It is a fun, no-brainer movie in which the good guys eventually win and the bad guys eventually lose, but some of the bad guys escape to set up the next movie.

As the movie opens, the GI Joes, an elite American special operations combat unit, are in action, securing some loose Pakistani nuclear weapons from insurgents in a superb action sequence inside a military facility.  However, the Joes are framed by the President, who is really an impersonator planted by the terrorist organization Cobra.  The fake President sends a military strike after the Joes, wiping out the unit.  The Cobra organization liberates its imprisoned leader and executes its clever plan to take over the world.

Fortunately, three of the Joes survive the ambush in Pakistan.  Led by Dwayne Johnson as Roadblock, they go underground, figure out the frame-up, and make contact with two key people: the ninja warrior Snake Eyes and a retired Joe, General Coulton.  Together, they will put together a plan to ambush Cobra at a nuclear weapons summit at Fort Sumter, South Carolina, of all places.

The action sequences are quite good, including shoot-em-ups in Pakistan and at Fort Sumter, and a fantastic ninja sequence on a cliff in some remote and unnamed mountain range.  Bruce Willis has an excellent extended cameo as General Coulton, while Jonathan Pryce enthusiastically chews the scenery as a real and fake president.

""G.I. Joe"", underneath all the high tech weapons, martial arts, and special effects, is a good old-fashioned action movie.  Park your brain and enjoy the ride.",1364688000,186,1835,4.973770491803279
4777777,1,B005LAII4E,"Duke, Snake Eyes, Flint, Storm Shadow, Roadblock, Mouse and Jinx among other cartoonish chracters laughably engage in non-stop 3D action that is aimed at whom?  Little boys that play with 12 inch dolls and their dads?  Saying GIJ V.2 is better than it's predecessor is not high praise.  Too many characters, too complex, absurd and ridiculous plot lines and way too many decibels.  Here the Joes are not only fighting their mortal enemy Cobra but also internal threats from their - ""our"" -- own government that jeopardize their very existence.  This is the epitome of concussive, mindless popcorn entertainment.  The President's kidnaped (What? Not again!), ninjas, knives, satellite weapons, London decimated and so on.  It actually wallows in its stupidity.  Dwayne ""the Rock"" Jonson, Channing Tatum, Bruce Willis collect their checks and Jon Chu (""Justin Bieber: Never Say Never"") directs like a dancer on steroids.  And to think that this $185 million production was held back from a late 2012 release to take advantage of Tatum's alleged ""star power"" and to give the movie an expensive $20 million 3D fix with additional shots, edits for more action - but even less clarity and coherence.",1364601600,11,1193,5.108247422680412
4777778,3,B005LAII4E,"Wow, that's one helluva timing, Paramount! The release of this action sequel actually coincides with North Korea declaring war on the South and the US, threatening the ""imperial"" west with nuclear annhiliation. Too bad, the G.I. Joes don't exist in real life, for they could have easily disarmed Mr. Kim within five minutes of screentime. That's exactly what's being depicted regarding the Pakistani atomic weapons and this is only one the various reasons this flick is too over-the-top and self-righteous for its own good.

Tangling serious and very topical issues like terrorism, nuclear disarmament and mass destructive weapons in such a perfunctory way perfectly illustrates what's wrong with modern-day Hollywood blockbusters. The action's for action's sake, the threat, and be it millions of deaths, is abused as a tool to entertain popcorn-munching audiences who have deliberately switched off their higher brain functions at the entrance.

It's been done countless of times before in action flicks, comic book movies etc. But as long as it's only about giant roving robots from outer space blowing up alien planets, that's fine with me. But it stops being funny when it's about real-life nuclear threats...pocking fun at North Korea (""Yeah, we can annhiliate you 15 times, not 14!"") and Pakistan, blowing up London without serving any real  purpose...it's dull, bland, lukewarm and shows a lack of any compassion and empathy for the upcoming victims of real-life nuclear disasters. I really feel bad for all those who might die in...come what may...

I kinda feel reminded of that pilot episode of ""The Lone Gunmen"", the X-Files spin-off that somewhat predicted 9/11. Is it going to happen again? Hopefully not, but it's either brilliant or excruciatingly bad timing, bringing out this turd of a movie right now at the brink of nuclear disaster in Korea.",1364601600,4,1862,5.217391304347826
4777779,2,B005LAII4E,"When the first live action G.I. Joe film, The Rise of Cobra, hit theaters in 2009, it was met with a high amount of negative criticism - and with good reason.  For many of us, G.I. Joe cartoon and action figures were a memorable part of our childhood, so it's only natural to be protective of a film that carries the name G.I. Joe - yet bared little resemblance to the characters associated with it.  Nearly four years later, a whole lot has changed in the world.  Suddenly, Channing Tatum, who played Duke in the first film, has become a household name.  His popularity has catapulted him into several starring roles, but The Rise of Cobra was still bad enough to go with the decision to gut the entire cast from the first film (partially including Tatum) and starting fresh with a new cast.  In the sequel, G.I. Joe Retaliation, Dwayne Johnson takes the reigns.

Directed by Jon M. Chu (Step Up 3D & Justin Bieber: Never Say Never), G.I. Joe Retaliation stars Dwayne Johnson as Roadblock, the new leader of the G.I. Joes.  Disguised as the U.S. President (Jonathan Pryce), Zartan launches an assault on the G.I. Joes, wiping most of them out, including their leader, Duke (Channing Tatum).  Now, Roadblock is forced to take command and lead the remaining Joes, including General Joseph Colton (Bruce Willis), Snake Eyes (Ray Park), Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki), and Flint (D.J. Cortona) against the newly freed Cobra Commander (Luke Bracey) and his nuclear weapon-wielding army.  Lee Byung-hun, Ray Stevenson, and Arnold Vosloo also star in supporting roles.

Let's jump right into this and start with the bad news first.  For months now, the rumor was Channing Tatum's character, Duke, was gettin' the ax early on in Retaliation.  Of course, Tatum is a popular guy these days, so early test screen audiences didn't handle his early demise  very well, which allegedly forced the delay of the film (with the guise of needlessly and pointlessly converting the film to 3D), thus leading to additional Tatum scenes.  In any event, Tatum still bites the dust early on in the film, right when all hell breaks loose.  His poorly written death (which is clearly evident in the trailer) is one of the most disappointing scenes of the film, even though it sets the ""retaliation"" theme into high gear.

Unfortunately, this sequel still follows a similar plot-line as its predecessor (ending in the same uneventful fashion) - thus bringing up some pretty bad memories in the process.  The Rise of Cobra dealt with Cobra being in control of a horrific weapon that could destroy a city, which eventually led to the destruction of France.  And, in the sequel, here we are again with Cobra in control of nuclear weapons, which eventually leads to the destruction of another major worldly city.  The action in these films is great, but at some point you'd think these writers would find something better to do than destroy cities.  For all the excitement within this film, it's still the bothersome repetitiveness that stands out.  And, speaking of standing out - James Carville makes a cameo, but still no Sergeant Slaughter?  Come on, man.

Despite its lows, G.I. Joe Retaliation has a few highs, and it starts with the ensemble cast.  Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, who seems to be everywhere these days, takes command of the Joes with his usual ""boots to asses"" mentality.  Johnson provides a magnetic charm, especially in his scenes with Tatum.  The chemistry between the pair made for some good, light-hearted laughs and it's a shame it didn't last longer.  With Tatum out of the picture, The Rock is now the clear-cut leader, displaying the enthusiasm and powerful leadership qualities needed to command a high profile cast of this caliber, which includes action guru Bruce Willis, along with Adrianne Palicki, and D.J. Cotrona.  Together, these characters come out guns a blazin' - providing a ton of action using some pretty high tech gismos, and a pretty agile tank.

The bottom line is this film's franchise is a mess.  Still, Retaliation is superior to The Rise of Cobra (although, it didn't take much).  Even though Retaliation features a new cast, the film still suffers from the same outstanding problems of the original:  plot direction and character development.  It would have been nice to see some more continuity in the script, other than the return of two silent ninjas (with relatively meaningless roles) and a brief appearance by Channing Tatum.  Seriously, would it have killed them to bring back Joseph Gordon-Levitt?  Regardless, if you're a true G.I. Joe supporter, go see the film - but if you aren't, and you weren't a fan of the first film, there's still not a whole lot more to see here.

4777780,2,B005LAII4E,"That, it has: lots of action. Stuff blows up, fight scenes with amazing choreography, heart-stopping stunts, exciting scenery all over the world, good guys win in the end - you know, the usual. And it has Bruce Willis's wise-cracking character, and that just makes an action flick more active.

(G.I. Joe fans should stop at this point.)

But, I now realize there's a hierarchy among movies. Although some are better and some worse, comic book movies often don't rise to the level of most other movies around. And movies based on video games rarely rise to the comic book movie level. And (fans of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barbie-movies/dp/B00B020PO8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barbie movies</a>&nbsp;are free to chime in), I suspect that movies based on toys are hard pressed reach the video game level. With Hasbro featured boldly in the credits, this falls well into that last category. So, if you really insist that movies make sense, even within their fictions, this won't offer you very much. And although Willis fit in well, he seemed sorely under-used by the script.

OK, of its sort, but not the most elevated sort.

4777781,4,B005LAII4E,"If you're anything like me you saw the trailer to ""Retaliation"" with Snake Eyes and Jinx having a hack `n slash sword fight against a bunch of disposable red-clad ninjas alongside a perilous sheer rockface and you were like ""awwww yeah!""  And then you waited...and waited as the release date got pushed back again and again (presumably to make more room onscreen for Channing Tatum's G.I. Joe ""Duke"").  So was the wait worth it?  And does the movie deliver the goods?  Is it at least better than ""The Rise of Cobra""?  Let's review.

First off fan favorites Snake Eyes and Stormshadow get more playtime this time around and we dive just a smidge more into their history so, coupled with their frenetic and exciting action sequences, this cinematic aspect of Joe lore satisfies though fans of these characters will still want more (at least of Snake Eyes).  Jinx, a female ninja with ties to both of them, also is an important crossroad connection for these two ninja brothers and her presence (played austerely by Elodie Yung) lends a bit of platonic heart to this testosterone-spewing slug out of a film.  Second Dwayne Johnson is on board as Roadblock, second in command after Duke.  Johnson has that piquant charisma that just commands your attention whenever he's on screen and that's true here but I expected his Roadblock to be a mean mountain hulk of a soldier with pure bullish bravado much like his characters in ""The Rundown"" and especially ""Fast Five""; while he has a little of this he is played up more as an intuitive soldier, a man to both have your back and be your friend.  I was a bit surprised by this but Johnson is easy to watch so terrific casting as far as I'm concerned!  And speaking of terrific casting Bruce Willis shows up with a nothing's-ever-so-bad-that-you-have-to-take-it-too-seriously General Joe Colton, the original general infantry grunt of this special ops group.  Willis (who doesn't seem to age, does he?) carries himself with his styled brass and insolence and is a good fit in the Joe universe.  And then there's Duke (Tatum) whose face on the posters just might bring in an extra cache of coin both here in the States and overseas.  (*SPOILER*ALERT*)  As you may have guessed, though, he's not in the film much.  I thought he was a bad fit in the first film, a little flat and certainly not commandeering enough as even a young Duke, but I actually liked him here and was sorry to see him disposed of so soon.  He and Roadblock have an easy way with each and some nice, comic moments together.  I didn't think that his inclusion would enhance the film and I was wrong.  (*END*SPOILER*ALERT)

As for whether or not you'll see your favorite Joe or Cobra baddie that depends: Firefly rocks this film!  Zartan (playing the President) is the main baddie and he has a little fun with it.  Lady Jaye (very fetching in a red evening gown; played by actress Adrianne Palicki) and Flint are the other two main Joes that comprise the team and follow Roadblocks command.  Mouse shows up nimbly, and of course there's Cobra Commander but not much is made of him though so much happens because of him.  Unless you're extremely well versed in Joe lore you'll miss the few others herein but you will miss Scarlett, Destro, the Baroness, Hawk, and more as they're not here (or, in Destro's case, you won't hear from him).  The bottom line is that if you dig on Snakes, Stormy, Roadblock, Lady Jaye, and Willis' new turn you'll still be happy even if your favorite Joe doesn't make the roster call.

So let's get down to the flint of it.  This movie is a fun booming action fest with plenty of hand-to-hand/ close quarters combat as well as firefights and big explosions galore that satisfies the popcorn muncher inside of me.  And that's the reason to see this slice of the Joe pie.  The formula of a small, tight band of militarized heroes with their backs up against the proverbial wall facing seemingly impossible odds is a winner that's just written into our DNA.  (No you won't be wrapped up in an intriguing potboiler twisty turny hard to follow story but it may surprise you as to how it takes its time to unfold; the story is simple--and simply revealed in the trailer I'm afraid.)  The action and the military technologies/ hardware are more grounded for the most part as is the overall tone of this film; largely, though not completely, gone are the fantastical elements from ""The Rise of Cobra"" thus giving ""Retaliation"" more gravity.  It's a much tighter script and storyline this time around.

So in the end was the wait of delay worth it?  If they originally didn't have any scenes with Channing Tatum then I will say that, yes, the delay was worth it as his scenes bring us in quickly to caring for our heroes.  Does the movie deliver the goods?  If you're an action hound you should be pleased.  Is it better than ""The Rise of Cobra""?  Roger that, hoo-rah!

[My last couple of comments have to do with the 3-D and some of the scene compositions/ blocking, especially early in the film.  Yes the 3-D enhances the movie but not too much and there are a couple of scenes that show a noticeable downgrade that made me wonder if they missed something in the makeover; I would suggest that you don't really lose anything seeing this movie in the regular format.  As far as the scene compositions/ blocking goes, there are several points when we are given a POV of looking over a person's shoulder or around a person, where their silhouette takes up a good portion of the screen, and this is distracting to the point where you will want to yell at them to get out of the way!  A minor gripe but a gripe nonetheless.]",1364256000,4,5649,4.608

For instance: Duke was killed-off too soon in the movie, and he was pretty much the main character of the last movie, and was a great character overall. Plus the battle sequences were well done, but only half as impressive as the first movie's were. About 70% of the characters that we came to love in the first movie were left-out of this one. And Flint hardly got any character development at all. But in the plus column: Dwayne Johnson was an excellent choice for Roadblock. Bruce Willis was excellent as Joe Colton. We get to see more development on the rivalry between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow. Jonathan Pryce and Arnold Vosloo were great with their rival characters... the president and Zartan! The prison break scene with Storm Shadow, Firefly, and Cobra Commander was awesome! Plus Cobra Commander's outfit was priceless.

 UltraViolet (I cannot figure out how to access the movie online. I am a college graduate and it's frustrating.)

A few more thoughts on UltraViolet: I am a middle-aged person. I am not a technology geek. However, I am a college graduate who can operate both a PC and Mac. But I have never been able to enjoy the UltraViolet system. When I read the word ""digital download,"" I assume that I will be able to save the movie to the hard drive of my PC or Mac. Whenever I purchase a DVD that features a digital download for iTunes, downloading the movie to my iTunes library is effortless. It's a joy to use. But I cannot say the same thing for UltraViolet. I just do not understand how it works. Although I have been told that I can easily download a movie to my mobile device, this has not been the case for me. In my experience with UltraViolet, a person can view the movie through an app but cannot actually save a copy to a device. To put it another way, if you want to watch G.I. Joe on a 10-hour airplane ride or during a storm when the Wi-Fi is down, you're out of luck because you simply cannot access the UltraViolet system.

THE BOTTOM LINE
Now maybe I sound unintelligent or foolish. But if I'm a consumer spending my hard-earned cash, the film watching experience should be enjoyable. To me, using UltraViolet in 2017 is just frustrating.",1488585600,,1657,5.007272727272727

The main reason I purchased the DVD after seeing it on Netflix was for the amazing zipline action scenes.  I was so blown away by this, admiring the digital effects that made it feel so real, was enough for me to buy it.  Story?  Well, all the same - good guys vs. bad guys, you know.  But how they get it done is where the entertainment value is.  For a few bucks, it is worth it!",1484352000,,556,4.101851851851852

4779889,1,B005LAII4E,"The only way to write a review was to give it one star. If zero stars was an option, this would receive zero stars.

The movie tried way to hard to insert comedy and tried just as hard to throw in a ton of characters without any development.

Hi Jinx, you and Storm Shadow are cousins or something. Hi Rza, you love Karate flix??? You're in. What happened to previous characters??? We couldn't sign or didn't want them so we don't talk about them at all in the movie.

The only reason I finished the movie was to say I was able to sit through without puking at the blatant hour plus long commercial this really is and not a movie.

I can go on and on, but I won't waste anymore of your time the way this movie does. Do not watch it.",1444176000,,732,4.0625

If you're familiar with the cartoon series you know that Flint was tough and knocking out his enemies left and right.

There's  simply not enough time taken with the character's development for you to actually care about anything they do. No back stories are given enough exposure for the audience to feel empathy  for the main characters. If you like mindless action, and a couple of decent action sequences, this is an okay way to pass some time.

Addendum: The GI Joe franchise seems like a perfect way to give military  vets some excellent and much needed exposure, and yet that never materialized in these films either.",1426809600,,560,4.673469387755102

The G.I. Joes are not only fighting their mortal enemy Cobra; they are forced to contend with threats from within the government that jeopardize their existence.

What did I think?

Putting Channum Tating, the Rock and Bruce Willis together in a movie sounds like a no-brainer. Sadly they mustve used up all the money on the cast and special effects (which are impressive, it must be said) and none on writers. Or continuity/error checkers. There are a couple of great action scenes but this 110-minute-long action-figure advertisement has more plotholes than. zzzz. Sorry, what was I writing?

4796844,2,B005LAII4E,"Well, I like action movies and I have two teenagers hanging out who will watch anything that has loud booms and some serious bad guys being kicked all over the screen. That being said, the first movie, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra was better.  While the first movie wasn't exactly a masterpiece, it did have character development and the Wayans guy for comic effect and unnecessary risk taking.  In G. I. Joe: Retaliation, the characters fall flat.  The Bruce Willis character is a nice touch yet he didn't have much to do plot wise.  I mean he was suppose to be the reason the team is called Joe as he is Joe and he is the arsenal supplier?  Not to mention he reenlists to serve under Dwayne Johnson -- really? Joe is taking orders instead of giving them.  Sure, sure.  My teenage nephew actually threw popcorn at the tv screen -- though he did pick up after himself.  Johnson just did not have the opportunity to show he's the leader -- certainly not someone Joe himself would follow.

The movie just fell flat and other than some tie in characters some who did stick around until the end -- it didn't even seem connected to the first movie much or honestly connected as a movie much either. If you want booms and bangs, it delivers.  If you want a half way decently thought out movie with some engaging characters with your bangs do yourself a favor, look elsewhere Retaliation just doesn't deliver on being an very good movie.",1421625600,,1429,4.482625482625482

The part for Bruce Willis was perfect.  He has a way if making even campy movies good.

But as a faithful fan of G.I. Joe I did purchase this movie, but I did wait until I could get it for $7 or less.

I wouldn't buy this movie unless you're getting it in a bargain bin.

I hope that one day the G.I. Joe franchise can be rebooted, and live up to it's awesomeness that was created for the animated series in the 80's-90's
Thanks,

4802173,4,B005LAII4E,"When I saw the previews for G.I. Joe Retaliation I was appalled. As if the Joe's hadn't had enough deaths in the first film the studio appeared to be intent on wiping out most of the rest of the Joe's. They were also adding Bruce Willis to the cast as the original G.I. Joe but in the last decade or so Willis has gone from action hero to grumpy old man. It's not that Bruce Willis is typecast as a sourpuss it seems like the man has literally become an old sourpuss. G.I. Joe is supposed to be a large team of distinctive specialist from all branches of the military so when you kill them all at the beginning of the movie it's really a slap in the face to fans and to my disappointment the preview really was an accurate representation of the movie and when the dust settled there were only three Joe's left plus Snake-eyes who was elsewhere. As a modest GI Joe fan who watched the old cartoons when they first aired I was disappointed but truth be told from a pure entertainment standpoint I thought the movie was much better than expected.

The first G.I. Joe movie is a bit of a guilty pleasure for me. I recognize and acknowledge its faults but it has enough fun parts that I found it watchable and occasionally quite fun. I found Retaliation to be a significant improvement even as the studio appeared to be trying desperately to distance themselves from the first movie. Retaliation is also another reason why I increasingly believe Rottentomatoes is completely out of touch as Rise of Cobra has a 35% and Retaliation has a 28%. The difference between G.I. Joe and the mega money making Transformers is that G.I. Joe actually creates likeable characters. Dwayne Johnson is fantastic as Roadblock but I pretty much liked all the Joe's. Likewise the villains were great but Jonathan Pryce stole the show. His Elliot Carver from Tomorrow Never Dies is one of my least favorite Bond villains but when he's given decent dialog Pryce is brilliant. There is a scene near the end where Zartan masquerading as the President of the United States makes an outrageous move threatening world Armageddon in front of all the Nuclear world leaders and Pryce is so perfect that for me this was the highlight of the film.

It's not a perfect film to be sure. Rise of Cobra had some very dodgy CGI and although its improved here there are still some moments of flakiness particularly in the signature scene where Snake-Eyes and Jinx are fighting on the side of a mountain. The film also has some really overused clichs including a scene where Snake-Eyes and Stormshadow are fighting alongside each other and end up back to back. The film also seems to have a gun fetish with endless clicking of bullets into the chamber. Bruce Willis's home literally seems half composed of guns. Most of the movie is competently made but sadly the ending is perhaps the weakest part and the way G.I. Joe finally foils Cobra's plan is just stupid.

It's a shame that the Transformer movies rake in over a billion and G.I. Joe makes well under half that amount. G.I. Joe is far from a brilliant masterpiece but the dialogue, plot and characterization are so much better. I also think G.I. Joe is a lot more enjoyable than reviewers are giving it credit for. Unlike Transformers I can sit down and watch G.I. Joe without feeling embarrassed. The old G.I. Joe cartoons were really hurt by FCC restrictions leaving the villains toothless and entirely unintimidating. The menace from Cobra feels real here and maybe the story didn't keep me riveted but I was entertained. I would only buy the movie if it was quite cheap but it is good enough that I would consider owning it.",1412553600,,3642,4.591397849462366

4804637,4,B005LAII4E,"I didn't have a problem suspending my disbelief for the duration of this movie.  It's based on the action figure toys I played with as a kid.

I didn't have a problem with (SPOILERS) a major character dying in the first few minutes.

I didn't have a problem with The Rock being a lead actor in this film.

What I have a problem with is the fact that The Rock plays Roadblock in the movie.  As my contemporaries might recall, Roadblock is basically G.I. Joe's cook.  He's a gumbo chef.  They even reference this early in the film.

Throughout the film, his co-stars refer to him simply as ""Block.""  Repeatedly.

With so much going on in the world, I couldn't watch a (nother) film that glorified war and toy guns.  This weekend Israel and Hamas were at war, Russia and the Ukraine were still at war, the civil war in Libya prompted western countries to evacuate, and more.

I will try to watch this another time.  I love Bruce Willis and Dwayne Johnson.  I even think Channing Tatum is growing on me.  (He was cute playing with the girls.)

I think this film had a lot of superhero qualities that we actually need to believe in, like Team Work and believing for an even higher level of expertise in our specialty, and also believing in achieving at higher levels in areas that may not be our own most favorite area of speciality...even when things have gone all wrong. There's a love motivation, and a sense of duty from which we make a decision to operate by faith and have courage for the sake of our team, and for the greater good.

I wasn't brought up on the Saturday cartoon series, so the whole mystique of the franchise was lost on me. I never owned any of the action figures, either. The plot was absurd, there was no character development, and the action set pieces were predictable. That being said, there was some very good wire work and the pacing was good.

4808155,5,B005LAII4E,"Five HUGE Stars! ****Upgraded to Five Stars**** The 2nd edition of the G.I. Joe series of movies, following ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" is full of action, adventure, and GREAT special effects starring the G.I. Joe Elite Team of ""Duke"", ""Road Block"", ""Lady Jaye"", ""Flint"", ""Snake Eyes"", ""Mouse"", ""Ship Wreck"", and others, taking place after the Nanomite War. Terrorist leader ""Cobra Commander"" and ""Destro"" are already in captivity; ""Storm Shadow"" and ""Zartan"" are still at large. The story begins with the ""Joe's"" involved in a rescue at the North-South Korea DMZ and later during another mission they are ambushed, which sets the stage for an international conspiracy. The rest of the story is pure enjoyable, entertaining Sci-Fi fun, with improbable scenarios, plot holes, lots of fights and explosions, while keeping the audience guessing as to who is on which side.

But it also features one of the most marvelous swashbuckling ""ninja fight sequences"" in years, at the 55 minute point of the movie, at a high mountain stronghold, away from the main `G.I. Joe' group. There are some amazing CGI sequences, `wire' fu, great fight and stunt coordination, and breathtaking matte landscapes that rival the likes of the Matrix Reloaded: it is definitely worth the price of admission for just this 7 minute sequence alone, which I have watched dozens of times by itself.

Great action, adventure fun in a $130 Million budgeted, expensive-looking movie which brought in $375 Million at the box office (the preceding film brought in $300M). Starring Duane ""The Rock"" Johnson, D.J. Cotrona, Adrianne Palicki of ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" fame, Channing Tatum of Magic Mike fame, Jonathan Pryce, Byung-Hun Lee, Elodie Yung, Luke Bracey, Ray Park, and Arnold Vesloo, there is a great cameo by Bruce Willis.

I do like that Walton Goggins is in it... but not long enough if you ask me.  If you are unfamiliar with Walton Goggins get familiar with him because he's an extraordinary acting talent.  Which leads me to the question, why is Walton Goggins in this movie?  It's painful enough to watch that I forgot he was in it.  Now that I remembered I'm tempted to watch it again.",1402617600,,527,4.158415841584159

I give it five stars because its a five star movie and if you watch it you too will rate it a five star movie.  When a older woman in her 60s can enjoy it and stay awake and enjoy it like I did!

4808770,3,B005LAII4E,"G.I. Joe: Retaliation is a good action packed movie that fills that adrenaline rush any audience who loves action would want.  The consistency of the action interspersed throughout the film was well placed, preventing you from feeling bored.  However, after watching the first G.I. Joe and knowing the storyline, this film was a bit disappointing because the storyline was not as clean and straightforward.  There were some areas that made an attempt to connect to the original story, but they were not clear to the new comer as to why cobra was acting as it was, nor was it clear why the Joe's were being attacked as they were.  It was nice to see snake eyes and his arch nemesis working together and why, but it was not clear how Storm Shadow survived death from the first show.  Loved the humor that Dwayne Johnson brought to the film and always love watching Bruce Willis.  I would have enjoyed this film a lot more if there had been a cleaner message or purpose to the storyline.  It just felt a bit disjointed, but the action was absolutely awesome.",1402272000,,1055,4.609625668449198

4808779,4,B005LAII4E,This movie was very good to me and especially since I love The Rock who has become a fine actor and works in good movies.  Bruce Willis was a plus to this group.  When the movie first starts it is a little difficult to keep up with what is going on because there are many scenarios to follow.  I liked the 1st GI Joe movie and this one was just as good.,1402012800,,353,3.875

Sigh, It started out pretty strong, but by the end of the movie I was so very sad.  it was like a 6 year old took over the script and just had ridiculous things happen one after another.

""First they get guns, which they find all over Bruce Willis' house; even behind the oven vent.  Then they're in a tank, then the bad guy falls/explodes/whatever, but lives . . .""  I could go on and on, but you get the picture.  It was a train wreck.

I felt that the scene with Lady Jane changing out of her red dress and being ""watched"" by reflection on a TV screen was inappropriate though.
In the words of my 10 year old - ""I liked this movie and the fact that it didn't have a lot of language.""  ""I liked Duke and that even though he is the leader he is a people person with great respect.""  ""I liked Joe's house and armory.""

He seems to be able to save franchise sequels like Fast Five, and does bring life to his part and the actors around him.

4809137,3,B005LAII4E,"Looking at this movie as a film adaptation of a comic book, it was pretty good. Lots of action, witty dialogue, lots of ""ooh, ahh"" moments and a decent plot. However, if you are actually in the military, or know anything about it, the absolutely ridiculous inaccuracies will make it nearly impossible to enjoy. I'm not referring to the outlandish weapons or tactics, those are expected. What gets annoying is that it seems like they didn't even try to make the characters look like soldiers during scenes that were supposed to be deeply serious. What ruined it for me was the final scene, where all of the characters were in dress uniforms during a ceremony, and Lady Jay has everything crooked on her uniform, wearing her hair down, and to top it off is wearing a Marine Corps Eagle, Globe and Anchor insignia on her Army ASUs. Anyone can take literally 2 minutes to google this kind of stuff and see how to make it look even quasi-correct. I know its a fictional movie based on a comic book but it literally seems like they were trying to be as wrong as possible, and that seriously gets on your nerves after a while.",1401667200,,1119,4.517241379310345

4809391,2,B005LAII4E,"Too much of the dialouge and acting seemed forced and excessively cliche.

4809643,2,B005LAII4E,"So yeah, this is definitely a franchise-ruiner. The first movie, and the first 15-20 minutes of this one are good, but then some very questionable plot choices allow the film to devolve into something that is silly and confused. Worth seeing on Prime if you're a fan of the Series, the Rock, the Goggins, Lady Jaye, Storm-Shadow (literally 20x more badass than Snake Eyes despite the talented Ray Park's efforts) or Ray Stevenson...but prepare to be deeply underwhelmed despite all of these potential bright spots.",1400889600,,514,5.0588235294117645

4809646,4,B005LAII4E,"The things that bother me are a few one the first movie seen to be more high tech then the second movie.  (spoiler ahead don't read the next paragraph)

 The whole satellite exploding as soon as the the rock's character presses that button is a bunch of bs. Here is why, it took forever for the satellites to get the designated spot to drop the bombs, ok I'll give them that. But then the whole thing is aborted by pressing one button, in which, It should had take a few second for the button transmission to get to the satellites but in this movie is about instantaneous, reaction,

Over all the movie is a good action movie, tech wise it's seems lower then the first one if you don't believe me watch the first one.
Yes It could had been better, the storm shadow twist plot was ok.  I personally would not had been happy if I have had to pay for viewing this movie, so in that regard I'll give it a four. If I had pay for it at the theaters I would be force to give it three stars.
Action wise is a good movie don't get me wrong, plot wise is ok but could had been better,  I think the budget probably didn't allow for a better scenes. Then ninja fights were cool.
If you can see it for free, say you have have amazon prime I would is recommendable, for viewing, if you have to pay extra I only recommended if you a Rock or Bruce Willis fan.",1400803200,,1343,4.08745247148289

It's good if you're still in elementary school, but hard to watch if you're any older.  The weak plot, cliche writing, over acting and copy cat setup sequences and delivery are all on the level of 80's tv after school cartoon level.  Even more contemporary cartoons have better writing than this.  I was only able to get half way through it before I had to call it quits.  I like cheesy action, and even 'b' movies that are so awful they are funny, but this is just is like some no man's land somewhere in between.  It's not so low budget that it's just cheesy fun, and it's not so high budget that it blows you away with the special effects.  It has just enough of an almost high budget look but with low budget follow through and execution.  It's almost like all the 'A' list talent of this film just did it as a favor to someone.  And all the 'b' list talent are trying their hardest to use this as a springboard to get famous and try too hard to get noticed by over acting and posing and flexing too much.",1400803200,,1180,4.185840707964601

I like a good action film just as much as the next guy but I found the long action scenes rather boring.  I would have preferred a bit more development of the story line.  The characters were hollow and there was not enough background to fill in the gaps between the two movies.

As a nostalgia piece it was interesting in that it made me feel like I did when I watched the cartoon as a kid. Of course now if the old cartoons are viewed through the eyes of an adult they're quite silly but as a child they were taught thrillers full of peril and intrigue.

The film starts off right by introducing a real sense of peril that was so lacking in Rise of Cobra. When you see a main character dramatically killed off then all of the following action sequences have actual peril because there's some chance that major characters might get killed off. From a nostalgic point of view this was a success as I can still remember Duke's horrifyingly grisly death in the old cartoon.

The 80's ninja action is in full effect with one of the most thrilling ninja fights I've ever seen. The Himalayan mountain top zip line fight is well executed and was enjoyable for any action film fan.

Did someone give Bruce Willis a coffee? Bruce Willis seemed to actually be awake for this one, his role is small but well done and is reminiscent of his early work standing in stark contrast with the last four or five of his films where he seemed to be sleepwalking.

Compared to most action films in recent memory Retaliation hold its own and is as good or better than the past 10-20 action films I've seen. As a license based film it does well to cater to nostalgia while standing on it's own for the uninitiated.

well worth watching especially if you enjoy action films, if you like 80's style ninja movies, or of you ever watched the old cartoon as a kid.",1400284800,,1678,4.362179487179487

The only tiny bit of character depth (which doesn't have to be mutually exclusive from an action movie) is shown at the beginning when they try to transition to Roadblock being the guy. But even that was pretty empty.

I recognize a few more of my beloved characters from childhood, but at least the first movie tried to make them more than a bunch of badass good guys. who needs to this kind of movie over and over again.

the most interesting ""action""scene was them hanging over the cliffs in a fight but as I sit back now I still think  -- its a dud. There was an action sequence in the first film in Paris that made me consider seeing this one... this movie does not pay it forward.

So, I got some guns, ninjas, tanks, helicopters, good guys, bad guys and a trip back to my 60s childhood. Fun stuff. Acting was good enough for a mindless action flick but certainly not great... one of the woman soldiers was hot and that helped but there really wasn't enough character building just hints at relationships being important.

that not withstanding, the overall premise of the movie was tired and half-baked. cobra/zartan convince the world joes are bad, hunt them down, and wipe out all but a handful of the joes. it's sort of like phantom menace, only with gatling guns instead of lightsabers.

anyway, a handful of joes manage to survive by hiding at the bottom of a well. at some point they manage to climb out and destroy cobra with a couple of dialup era computers, a ranchero, and john ""yippie-ki-yay"" mcclane.

there's a subplot that involves karem abul-jabbar trying to teach snake eyes and storm shadow a few deep life lessons, but turns out he only speaks in parables with an asiatic accent and they don't get it. this results in jinx and snake eyes running down the side of a mountain with the emperor's imperial guards in hot pursuit while storm shadow zip lines to the joe side.

at the end of the day, the joes come out on top, dr. claw smashes his fist on the desk growling ""i'll get you gadget,"" and the joes await their next assignment.

children of the 80s should skip the whole sordid and confusing affair and let nostalgia rest in peace. anyone else watch at your own risk.

4810856,1,B005LAII4E,"Acting was that of children and in fact many children do a far better job now that I think of it. Another movie made to dumb down even KIDS and feed them a steady diet of violence so when our government kills or goes to war killing mostly innocent woman, children and old people we don't think ANYTHING of it because we grew up seeing that same old story a million times.
No story of value here  and direction wasn't too good but acting  and believable plot was made for two year average intellect of two year olds today.

4811189,1,B005LAII4E,"In the first movie the Joes were a high-tech military branch, in the second movie they are nothing more than a group of clumsy soldiers trying to be special forces. While the overall plot is somewhat simplistic, the scene to scene details often make zero sense. Why didn't cobra chuck a couple grenades down the well at the start? Why does the Rock fire a weapon in the last shot of the movie *at an award ceremony with the president in attendance.* (Sadly, the cut to credits before we get to see every secret service agent within earshot tackle him) These are just some of a number of bad choices that make this movie make zero sense.

Additionally, the movie as a whole feels like it has a much lower budget than the first.

The nuclear disarmament scene was the highlight of the film with the only bit of clever writing in the whole script and with a set design nod to Dr. Strangelove.",1399507200,,889,4.414634146341464

4811192,2,B005LAII4E,"I thought the first GI Joe movie was pretty good, for what it was. The follow up makes even less sense. It's got some good explosion/chase/bang-bang scenes, but the plot doesn't hold together, even with willing suspension of disbelief.",1399507200,,235,5.051282051282051
4811193,3,B005LAII4E,"Anyone that's familiar with the franchise shouldn't be surprised by this movie, it's not a deep film with a message and it's not trying to be.  It's an action film that's only trying to entertain it's audience. If you want a deep plot, look elsewhere. If you want action sequences, chicks with guns, and macho one-liners, this might be for you.

There isn't near as much focus on technological weapons and armor as there was in the first movie. In fact, there were only two, neither of which were very impressive.

There were some good fight sequences, but with one or two exceptions, they all seemed rushed. The final battle sequence even felt almost like it was an afterthought, when it should have been the most gripping scene of the movie.  All in all, the director leaned way too heavily on the talents and fame of the three big stars in the movie (The Rock, Bruce Willis, and Channing Tatum) when they should have put more thought and effort into the fight scenes.",1399507200,,970,4.589595375722543

Having said all of that, it was incredibly FUN and a nice way to lost time that I will never get back.  If you go into it

Pure mindless entertainment, lots of explosions, chicks with machine guns -- a ninja guy in white, and some robocop looking guy, whose face we never see and a  cameo by the chief ninja master who I think was evil, I never got that part of the story of which little was clear.  But the reason why I probably watched it in the first place, was Dwayne Johnson!  -- who cares about all the rest.  Bruce Willis shows up when the film is almost over -- but his part was small anyway.  I actually didn't intend to see this movie -- I had been having some audio issues with my reception, so I just clicked on the first thing that came up in Prime, to check if everything with my TV was working as it should, and this movie just happened to be the first in line -- I never expected to watch it -- so that says something right there.

He wipes an entire European nation off the map, killing countless of millions & that's all he has to worry about? Answering to congress?

- Fight sequences are good without excessive violence (blood and guts)
- Pyrotechnics/special effects are appropriate without going overboard

The ugly: plot holes. I'll state the obvious one since it's in the trailer, Storm Shadow, a fan favorite antagonist who in the first film (spoiler) was seemingly killed...well let's throw him back in there.  We have merchandise to sell darn it.
The rest:  well if you like Dwayne Johnson, here you go.  Enjoy.  I for one do enjoy the Rock's movies, but GI Joe is a TEAM so the writers should have taken a cue from Fast and Furious franchise and built on that.

Being The Original GI Joe, he must step out of retirement and into his old army boots, to help Roadblock, Lady Jane, Snake eyes, and the 'temporary' ally Storm Shadow, OR, the defaced Joes are history!

4813407,4,B005LAII4E,"The action movie genre is quite well populated and, frankly, I don't ask for much from it. GI Joe goes beyond being a movie based on a comic book. It's actually based on a doll - excuse me - action figure. But its dubious genesis aside, this movie is pretty good. It is, of necessity, science fiction. It follows a formula: The elite action team is framed for wrongdoing, betrayed, attacked and slaughtered, and disavowed by the nominal civilian authorities. The team, all by itself, has to regroup the survivors, figure out what happened to the President, and engage in a series of implausible infiltrations and armed actions to crush the bad guys and restore the rightful authority to power.
  The plot is pretty standard - Think ""Dirty Harry."" Except it's not one cop stepping outside the box, it's a small military unit.
  But we aren't looking for anything profound, are we? If we wanted that, there's a dusty copy of Soren Kierkegaard on the bookshelf. No! We want shootings and explosions, and quasi-romance with babes who are also psychotic killers, but in a good way.

4813511,4,B005LAII4E,Lots of action and intrigue.  It'll keep you watching to see if the good guys can clear their good names and save the world from the plot hatched by the bad guys.  I'd watch the pre-quels and the sequels for a couple of hours of fun.  I thought it was pretty well written.  Four Stars.,1398470400,,285,4.127272727272727

4813605,3,B005LAII4E,Not as good as the first installment but worth watching on a rainy day. A few of the scenes are cheesy and for some reason the Joe's technology seems to take a step backwards.,1398470400,,175,4.176470588235294

If you need a patriotic beat'em up with an enemy that doesn't offend, this is the one. I can't decide if it was an Action/Adventure because of the action or a Comedy because of the storyline.  I will be watching again as it was fast paced enough that I am sure a missed a few things.",1398470400,,422,4.209876543209877

4813676,2,B005LAII4E,I don't know why I watched the whole thing. It was terrible from top to bottom. It wasn't even campy enough to be funny. They got the military stuff wrong like enlisted hanging out with officers and senior enlisted ordering officers around. Everything was incredibly lame. If I had to find a worthwhile part it would be the Lady Jaye scene with the fake President where she pretended to be a Fox News interviewer and he made a fair and balanced joke. Other than that line I'm not sure that there were writers for this movie. Thinking about it I am very generous giving this movie 2 stars.,1398384000,,588,4.453703703703703

4813683,1,B005LAII4E,"This movie is just bad.  Very little character development, the story just seems rushed, the sound effects and score just seem too borrowed from his other movies and it ruins the whole message of the G.I. Joes.

4813767,3,B005LAII4E,"I mean on the one hand you have The Rock, Bruce Willis, Channing Tatum, Byung-hun Lee, Ray Park and some pretty fun set pieces. On the other hand the story is totally incoherent (and I love watching bad action movies) even for a movie based on a cartoon and toyline from the 80s.  It is certainly better than the first movie, but they really didn't have to do that much to improve on that train wreck.

And they don't wear helmets, which really cracked me up. The main characters manage to get from the other side of the world to the US with no money, wearing nothing but battle fatigues. Next thing we know here they are. One of the joes gets to dance with the president and there's no Secret Service or protection any where to be seen.

4814270,1,B005LAII4E,Action movies are highly anticipated in our house and we enjoyed the first GI Joe (my 2 kids and I watch together). While this show delivered on the action - don't bother to watch if you liked the first GI Joe. Why? The people you like are not there. I don't know the thinking behind this movie but I'd say the creator's/writer/director were all taking the same drug. I LOVE Dwayne Johnson but felt only disappointed he was the star and Channing was killed off (If you didn't know this by now then you need to get out more...). Where were the rest of the stars/actor's from the first movie? And Bruce Willis? Love him too but I think he's done this role a few times before. It gets one star because there is action but if you want to enjoy a movie that stays true to the base it has created - think Marvel. GI Joe just seemed to quit trying to make a good second movie at some point.,1398211200,,883,4.169590643274854

Positive: Great ninja fight scenes

Negative: no character development. Actually, the best developed characters are the bad guys. There is a thin attempt to develop good guy characters, but they use cliche story lines. One good guy that was actually likable dies right at the beginning, which is actually a good thing (see first paragraph).

Negative: Plot holes! At one point you will say to your self ""Why did that explode? That should not have exploded! That makes no sense!""

Negative: Constant action. Too much action cheapens it and you develop tolerance and do not enjoy it.",1398038400,,823,4.54054054054054
4814646,2,B005LAII4E,"I enjoyed the first live action GI Joe movie, but this one wasn't even disappointing - it was just bad. I'm a big fan of fun, camp movies, but this one lacked even that. Sure, The Rock did a great job if playing a likeable character, but he was the only somewhat fleshed out character. Lady Jaye is a half-built character, and Flint is non-existent. I honestly barely even remember Bruce Willis in the movie.

Basically, the problem was that the film was a creative misstep. Had they played up the idea of Cobra in control of the US military, it would have put the film in a much stronger creative direction. Instead, that aspect is largely downplayed, in exchange for a very random Snake Eyes/Stormshadow revenge team up that felt so random. The randomness ties to the flawed pacing and act structure of the movie. Long, blown out action sequences take up a majority of the movie, but unfortunately there's little substance to hold everything together.

Long story short, I had low expectations for the movie and wanted to enjoy it, but unfortunately one is better off watching either the original live action, the original cartoon film, or something else entirely for solid action movie fun.",1398038400,,1193,4.758454106280193

Nothing about this movie feels right, starting with the incredibly corny and poorly delivered lines. So much corn...

The action sequences are standard fair for an action movie. But after watching the last couple of years of superhero films, you just come to expect more than a few punches, a few explosive devices, and a few grappling-in-midair sequences. This movie does all of them, but nothing is going to stand out enough to be noteworthy.

If you go into this movie realizing that the GI Joe series has been primarily to sell toys to kids then you should enjoy it. The story isn't bad and there are some pretty good fight scenes. If you are watching this movie expecting major blockbuster then you will be disappointed. Some of the acting is not up to par and feels awkward and forced.

Then, while this strangeness is going on, the movie cut in and out to some bad guy called Stormsomething where a weird Inuit living in the mountains is pouring a bizarre liquid which resembles snot onto his back.

Record breaking disappointment. I am completely filled with regret for watching this film. If there were anyway to unwatch it and undo the royalties caused by my watching it, I would.

Movie is pretty much action based a lot more than the last one which is good since the first movie had crappy scripting. All main characters stayed, but with a cool switch between good guy - bad guy position except with the kill off of captain duke what a risk on the writers.  Ending wasn't that bad I thought the fact to rule the world is to get rid of all the nukes from all the other countries great idea concept.

4816051,3,B005LAII4E,"This movie is exactly what you think it would be. It is cliche and formulaic, but OK for a not too serious ride. The story is full of holes. The movie is pretty much one long, soulless fight. You won't bond with the characters or care about them because there is no chemistry or character development. Some of the actors are so poor (esp. the sensi and one of the generals) that they cannot even pronounce the words they are supposed to be saying. I actually laughed a few times at the dialog and the way the clueless and miscast actors stumbled through their parts.
To sum up, its an adequate but soulless movie that is OK for a night's viewing if there is nothing else to watch and you want some action and decent fights. If you want anything else, look for another movie.

4816055,2,B005LAII4E,"I have to start out with the simple view that there never should have been a sequel to the first GI Joe movie.  On no level did it deserve one.

That being said, it's pretty obvious what level of expectation I had going into this movie, and long story short - the only good things about this movie were the scenes with Snake Eyes (much like the first movie).  Even adding in Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson didn't help this franchise get any better.  It was very surprising the amount of flashy camera tricks used even when Johnson was fighting.  He's a veteran of fake fights from Wrestling, he should have had a much easier time putting on a show.

All in all, the fight sequences not including Snake Eyes, Shadow Storm, and Jynx were pathetic.  The acting was a little better than the first movie, but that still means it's worse than most.  The special effects were a little better also, but frankly that's not enough to compensate.  Bruce Willis was clearly phoning in his performance.  I hope he enjoyed the paycheck.

I can only hope that this movie didn't do well enough in the box office that the production companies refuse to make a 3rd movie in this pathetic attempt to make money off our childhood.",1397260800,2,1205,4.506912442396313

4816057,3,B005LAII4E,"So the other day I went to the Museum of Better Luck Next Time, that notorious repository devoted to failed ventures. There, I eyeballed mothballed exhibitions of the Betamax, the lambada, the last batch of M. Night Shyamalan movies, and broccoli. Halfway thru the door, two sweaty porters were hauling in G.I. Joe: Retaliation but were arguing about whether it's earned a place in the museum. After all, one porter argued, it cut an impressive swath in the box office. The other porter retorted that it was a critical disaster. Turned out these guys were lost. Minutes later I saw them hauling the thing into the Museum of Soulless But Profitable Enterprises.

G.I. Joe: Retaliation is both a reboot and a direct sequel, but probably it's not worth your time to mull over that bit of conundrum. Gone are those faux-future tech battle suits. Gone is the onscreen blight that is a Wayans. Really, there's no point in comparing The Rise of Cobra with Retaliation and which is the better film. They're both guilty pleasures. They both sort of suck. But which one sucks less? Me, I prefer the cartoons. I even prefer that YouTube clip of Destro and the Baroness practicing the clarinet.

We see the fallout to a cliffhanging plot thread from The Rise of Cobra. It's been what? - months since that master of disguise, Zartan, supplanted the American President (Jonathan Pryce), took over his face, assumed his role. It was only a matter of time before Zartan set into motion a chain of events that would neutralize (and disgrace) the G.I. Joes and set free the incarcerated Destro and Cobra Commander. At 0600, in northern Pakistan, in the Indus Valley Desert, the Joes are presumed K.I.A. But not so fast. They should've been more thorough. Now, the remnants of America's most elite fighting unit must turn to the reclusive General Joe Colton (Willis), the original Joe himself. Yippee-ki-yay.

If your name is Marvin, you can't be blamed for assuming a codename... like Roadblock. We're right away introduced to Sgt. Marvin F. Hinton a.k.a. Roadblock (the Rock), right-hand man to Captain Duke Hauser (Channing Tatum). Their bust-your-chops bromance is one of the film's highlights for me. The Rock has got such a big personality, he translates to instant watchability and immediately boosts the film's energy level.

I like the additions of Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki), Flint (D.J. Cotrona), and Jinx (Elodie Yung). I still wish Sgt. Slaughter had made it into the movie, but Hasbro and Mattel just weren't able to work out a settlement. It's a sprawling cast, so maybe it can't be helped that the narrative is so scattershot. There's a lot of plot going on, probably too much, as it shifts from this and that thread. Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow get mired in ninja drama. It's not fair for a dumb, loud, big budget action film to expect us to use our brains. I had already parked mine.

The discriminating critic will cringe all the live long day. An ounce of forgiveness is a must if you want to enjoy this one. Yes, Bruce Willis sleepwalks in his role. Yes, RZA bollocks it up as Blind Master, and never mind that he's a tremendous devotee of wushu cinema. Yes, the whiplash plotting may get under your skin. But there's the wicked ninja action brought about by Snake Eyes (Ray Park), Storm Shadow (Lee Byung-hun), and Jinx. Omigosh, Snake Eyes and Jinx fighting Cobra troopers on the mountain side! It's a cool combat sequence that was inspired by Larry Hama's famous silent issue of the 1980s G.I. Joe Marvel comic. And there's Adrianne Palicki's gorgeous-ing it up in spots and you can see why she was tapped as Wonder Woman. And Flint's mastery of parkour. And, again, the Rock. The cast alone - despite Willis' phoning it in - improves the viewing experience from The Rise of Cobra. The action beats are still absurd, and that's the fun of it. Maybe the action would've wowwed me more, but I just saw The Raid 2 and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. But Retaliation, more so than The Rise of Cobra, captures the aesthetic of the classic cartoon show. Overall, I got what I wanted out of G.I. Joe: Retaliation, a soulless, profitable movie. So 3 out of 5 stars. Fun action beats and the Rock's swaggering it up and Snake Eyes' playing it cool. But I had more fun watching Funny or Die's ""The Ballad of G.I. Joe"" on YouTube.",1397260800,,4331,4.731125827814569

4816156,2,B005LAII4E,"When it comes to movies starring The Rock, I don't feel satisfied unless there are gallons of scenes of him clothes-lining  bad guys with his giant arms and popping veins in his gigantic neck. I also require some witty banter with a bro or maiden, accompanied by his winning smile. There are bonus points for that eyebrow thing he does.

In G.I. JOE Retaliation, Dwayne  Johnsons character Roadblock has witty banter with Channing Tatums character Duke. Roadblock is only second in command in this band of brothers, which seems entirely wrong. Duke never feels in charge, probably due to the commanding onscreen presence of The Rocks neck muscles. Those neck muscles take orders from NO ONE.

The bad guys that are due a good woopin are the terrorist minions of Cobra, who have captured the president and put in place a stooge with the presidents identical face. This evil president frames the Joes for terrorism and has them all exterminated.  Only Roadblock and a handful of others survive, and they begin their quest to retaliate.

I never saw the first G.I. Joe film, 2009s Rise of Cobra, nor do I have any knowledge of the comics or the cartoon. I do remember their public service announcements where kids would get into trouble and a random soldier who apparently was standing around watching them gives them some advice. A little creepy. But the general idea of the franchise is about soldiers with superhero names, Batman/Iron Man level equipment, and also a few ninjas thrown in for good measure.

Theres a good ninja and a bad ninja. I think. Snake Eyes fights for the Joes, wears all black and never says a word. Storm Shadow is on team Cobra, wears all white, and talks a little. I never understood what these guys had to do with the rest of the G.I.Joe squad. Is Snake Eyes a government soldier or just a vigilante? And doesnt he know the bad guys that are taking over the world call themselves Cobra? Get a less offensive name, dude!

The ninja bits in the film were bogged down with back-stories that I assume were in the first film, so I was lost. Those scenes were not beginner friendly, seeing as I remained confused at what had gone down.

Its around that time in the movie that Bruce Willis appears to save the day. Hey! I totally forgot you were in this, Bruce! He plays General Joe Colton, the original G.I. Joe.  He doesnt have many scenes in the film, which is expected, but too bad. After all, it did seem like Willis was the added boost in the marketing campaign to get non Joe fans in the theater. It worked on me.

Speaking of the add campaign, if it felt like youve been hearing about the sequel for a long time, its because you have. Paramount had originally slated the picture to open on June 29th, 2012. They had already blanketed the world with posters and previews; even a high-priced super bowl ad. But suddenly, they announced they were delaying its release to March 28, 2013, giving them time to add in 3D effects. This reason has been debated; some saying it was due to negative screenings and script revisions. They also added more scenes of The Rock and Channing Tatum goofing around together, because people liked that witty banter.

Retaliation is a goofy, cartoony action film that may fall a little short of being real fun.  It feels made for the 11 year old boy audience (even though its rated pg-13), and if I was 11 years old I would probably love this movie. Actually, like I said, I wasn't a fan when I was 11, so I probably wouldnt. Its directed by Jon M.Chu, whos last film was Justin Bieber: Never Say Never; which is presumably a film made for 11 year old girls. I think Chu has found his demographic.

It clocks in at 110 minutes, which was about 30 minutes too long for me. I do enjoy seeing the The Rock do his thing, and Bruce Willis seemed to be enjoying himself here. I would have preferred the movie to go even farther with its absurdity and tongue in cheekiness, similar to Machete or Hot Fuzz. Instead, Retaliation toes the line of coolness and wanting to be taking seriously, if ever so slightly. I suppose its more watchable than its counterpart, Transformers. Personally, this was their one shot to make me a Joe fan, and I don't think Ill be tuning in again.

4816269,3,B005LAII4E,"The central problem facing the G.I. Joe franchise is that while it is based on a toyline, comic book, and cartoon, it doesnt quite have enough fantastic elements to be viewed as a comic book film.  Yet at the same time it has too many fantastic elements to be considered a gritty, terrorist war type of film.  Incredibly G.I. Joe Retaliation is even more over-the-top than the Expendables films, and thats quite an achievement.  Not that the film is badit is significantly better than its predecessor, in fact.

The Joe Team is called in to recover some nuclear warheads stolen by terrorists in Pakistan.  The team led by Duke (Tatum) is successful in their mission but while awaiting their extraction they are ambushed in military air strike, ordered by Zartan (Arnold Vosloo), who is impersonating the President of the United States (Jonathan Pryce) using nano technology.  Most of the unit is wiped out including Duke with Roadblock (Johnson), Flint (D.J. Cotrona) and Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) the only survivors.

Zartan as President announces an agreement with Cobra to replace the Joes as Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) and ex-Joe Firefly (Ray Stevenson) rescue Cobra Commander from an underground maximum-security prison in Germany.  The surviving Joes return to the U.S. and seek the aid of General Colton (Willis), the man who formed the Joes.  Meanwhile Snake Eyes (Ray Park) is sent by the head of the Arashikage clan to capture Storm Shadow who is accused of killing the clans leader known as the Hard Master.  With the Zartan soon ready to meet with the other worlds super powers, the Joe team has to stop his plans before Cobra can gain control of the entire worlds nuclear arsenal.

Ok, so the plot is a grand pile of hokum and nothing but an excuse for a couple of hours of mayhem, but G.I. Joe Retaliation is still a lot of fun.  G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra made the mistake of trying to include far too many characters of the Joe mythos and while trying to throw all of these characters onscreen it lost its story in the process.  Retaliation streamlines the cast focusing primarily on Roadblock, Flint, Lady Jaye, and Snake Eyes. Director Jon Chu seems to recognize this when Storm Shadow and Firely rescue Cobra Commander but leave Destro behind.

The film features several dazzling set pieces and action sequences.  The highlight is no doubt the battle between Snake Eyes and Jinx and the Red ninjas while attached to grappling lines along the side of a cliff.  Its a marvelous sequence that steps out of the usual martial arts type of fights for something that is fresh and inventive.  Roadblock and Firefly also square off in a couple of good, old fashioned brawls.  Ray Stevenson steals the show from the Cobra side of things as the ruthless villain with a penchant for pyrotechnics.  Since Storm Shadow basically jumps ship, Zartan is disguised as the President and Cobra Commander is, well, boring, it is Stevenson who gives Cobra its edge and identity.

Tatum and Johnson have a great rapport and some fun scenes but unfortunately Tatums character gets killed off far too soon leaving The Rock to have to carry the action for the rest of his uninteresting co-stars.  Even worse is adding Bruce Willis to the mix. Willis no longer plays characters but simply plays Bruce Willis, smirking his way through every scene.  I wonder if he was getting a million dollars a day for this film.  Add to that we have some of the worst depicted world leaders ever and this isn't an experience driving by performances.

In the end, however, G.I. Joe Retaliation is harmless fun that made me long for the days of my G.I. Joes with the fuzzy heads and Kung-Fu grip.

I was sort of taken back when a main character dies within 5 minutes of the start of the movie.  Other than that, the movie is a crazy action-packed shoot em up/blow em up ride that has no bearing on real life capabilities or events.  I don't know why so many movie snobs rated this poorly on rotten tomatoes and all over the mediasphere.  Take it for what it's worth - it's a fantasy/action movie, much like Star Trek: Into Darkness, which does not happen to fit the science fiction genre.",1391126400,,585,4.4392523364485985

4816364,3,B005LAII4E,"When I heard that this movie was more accurate than the first, I became very excited. I have been a fan of G.I. Joe for years, and while I did like the Rise of Cobra, I still couldn't help but feel like they could've done better. This movie satisfies my desire for accuracy better than the first, but still fails to make an overall high-quality action movie.

Story: The Joes are framed for a crime they didn't commit (Renegades, anyone?), and most of their men have been killed in a desert ambush. Plus, Zartan, who is disguised as the President, freed Cobra Commander from prison. And, hey! Storm Shadow's alive! Why not bring him back with no good reason? Anyways, I didn't like how they had some major plot holes like the one I just mentioned and the fact that Duke and Snake Eyes are the only Joes who returned from the first film. So I'd say the plot is merely okay. It was not done as well as in this film as it was in G.I. Joe Renegades (which is probably my favorite version of the Joes. Check it out!)

Acting: It's really hit-or-miss. Channing Tatum (who I thought was okay in the first one) was very good in this film. He brought great honor to my favorite character (Duke). Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson was pretty good as Roadblock, and Bruce Willis was pretty much perfect as Joe Colton (they should've given him more screen time, though). Cobra Commander has a new actor, which doesn't matter much since the majority of the film he's wearing a mask, and unfortunately his voice is still deep. It doesn't bother me much, though, because his costume is so much like the old cartoon and figures (as opposed to the first movie). Jonathan Pryce is also pretty good as the President (and Zartan playing the President), and Ray Stevenson's Firefly is very good as well. Now it's time to go into the negatives of the acting. Lady Jaye's and Flint's acting are not noteworthy, while Blind Master and Jinx have just down-right bad acting.

Writing: Dialogue is okay I guess. I found the dialogue between Duke and Roadblock to be very entertaining, but the rest is pretty basic.

Action: The action scenes are more realistic and cooler than those of the first movie. You won't be watching CGI robotic suits running around Paris doing the fighting for the main characters. These felt more like what I wanted in a live-action G.I. Joe movie. My only problems were that they're weren't as frequent as I thought they would, and that Snake Eyes' suit was so bulky that he wasn't as fast or skilled as he was in the first.

Special Effects: Good enough. There weren't any eye-popping moments like in the Transformers movies, but there weren't any ugly moments like in the first G.I. Joe.

Costumes: The Joes are wearing camo, Firefly looks accurate enough to the original, the Cobra soldiers actually bear the Cobra logo on their uniforms, and Cobra Commander looks a lot like Cobra Commander. The only complaint that I see is in Snake Eye's uniform (it's really bulky). The costumes may be one of the best parts!

In the end, It's a really good G.I. Joe movie... just not a very good movie. Overall: 7.5 out of 10.",1389830400,,3110,4.562724014336918
4816365,3,B005LAII4E,Great actors but mediocre writing/acting. It seemed like the movie makers knew this and sold the movie on the merits of having a great cast.,1389830400,,140,4.64

4816367,4,B005LAII4E,"Hello all
Let me say i liked this movie i saw the first Moive GI joe Rise of Cobra and this movie picks up from that and while it does leaves things out it also adds alot to them.

Pros
first off the new characters such as jinx, roadblock, Flint and Lady jay are great joes and add alot to the team and the movie and having snake eyes and Duke back on board connect the two movies. The new Cobras Firefly, and is awesome as a bad guy and the new look for cobra commander is a throwback to the old cartoon series unlike the first one which really tried and failed to do it's own thing.

Secondly the story of the movie is great, continuing where the last one is left off, and showing the Joes on the ropes really brings out the characters and they really show the situation they are in, and the authenticity of the tacitics boths sides use is pretty good but is surrounded by some crazy technology and the end has a big twist that could show where the series could go.

the special features are great my favorite is the option to choose the scheme of the blu from cobra red to G.I.Joe blue. The deletes scene are cool and commentary is pretty wicked, the main pull though will be the mission briefing that describes the production of the movie and shows how the movie was made.

Cons
There are not alot of cons but a few

first of there are times where you have to ask why a character did this or that and makes you go why did he do that and it deviates from the establish character canon

There could have been more explaining of how storm shadow suvived and how duke got to be leader of the joes

the ending can be a little to fantadstic for me but it was still awesome/

Finally there could have been more deleted scenes four wasn't enough for me

In the end this is a great popcorn movie and is good but turn your brain off at that door",1389744000,,1839,4.114525139664805

The movie had everything I should have hated in a movie: corny acting, cheesy dialogue, strange almost-racist-but-I-guess-flattering depictions of Asians, Marlon Wayans, overly over-the-top action sequences, you name it. And yet I had a blast. I was almost embarrassed to admit that it was one of the most downright fun movies I'd watched in a while.

G.I. Joe: Retaliation takes it to the next level and, not surprisingly, it works again. Dammit, I guess I'm a total child inside. The action is still over-the-top, the dialogue is cheesier than ever, RZA is even more annoying than Marlon Wayans (I'm sorry, that might have been racist to automatically compare the two), the ""Asian-inspired"" scenes/music are so cliche that they're hilarious, the plot is still completely predictable, and on and on and on.

About the only good thing I can say for the film was the small role Bruce Willis played. Otherwise it was a showpiece for the ""Rock"" as the main character ""Duke"" gets killed early on.

4816714,2,B005LAII4E,"""Preposterous"" does not even begin to describe ""GI Joe: Retaliation,"" which regales us with the further adventures of Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Flint (D.J. Cotrona) and Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki of ""Friday Night Lights"" fame and, oh, how the mighty have fallen!) as a trio of specially-trained operatives referred to - and always in the most reverential and jingoistic of tones - as ""the Joes.""

In one of those President-in-Peril scenarios that have become all the rage in Hollywood these days, the dastardly criminal organization known as COBRA has kidnapped the POTUS (Jonathan Price) and replaced him with an evil look-alike as part of a mad scheme to take over the world through nuclear blackmail. Only these three Joes and the reformed ninja, Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee), apparently, can prevent that from happening.

Written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick and directed by Jon M. Chu, this sequel to the 2009 original follows the well-oiled but still creaky formula to a tee: find as many things and people as you can to shoot down or blow up, toss in some tough-guy talk and posturing, then add a few snappy one-liners, an assortment of cool CGI effects, some serious gun fetishism and you've got what it takes to make an action movie in the 21st Century. Everything except brains and believability, that is.

However, in all fairness, this one does at least throw in a bit of Zen-wisdom pseudo-profundity in a futile stab at respectability.

In addition to the aforementioned actors, Bruce Willis, Walter Goggins and even James Carville, more or less playing himself, put in brief appearances. Lucky for him, Channing Tatum gets to boogie on out of the place early on.

At times more a parody of an action movie than an action movie itself, ""GI Joe: Retaliation"" doesn't bode well for the future of the franchise.",1387756800,2,1827,4.938110749185668

There were only a few characters carried over from the first movie & one of them was killed off really early in the movie.  There was also one that you figured was dead in the first movie but winds up being alive in the 2nd.
This isn't a bad movie but it shouldn't have been called GI Joe.  That makes you think that it is going to be related to the first one & it really isn't.  But it is a good movie to watch.  I enjoy movies like this & don't care if others don't think that the plot is very good.  I could care less what they think.  I like movies that have a lot of action & also don't completely rely on special effects.  (Although there are some I do like some that do completely rely on special effects.)

Lady Jaye and Jinx were a good addition to the team. The guy whose life Duke saved was so non-discript I can't remember his name.  It was like Dwayne Johnson was casted to take over the main character.  He is way over-rated; Channing Tatum's character is well suited to have lead the Joes in victory.  Now my favorite of all times, Bruce Willis and his inter-action with Lady Jaye, then the honor he gave her at the end was just that, honorable. The twist with Storm Shadow was unexpected, nice.

4816846,3,B005LAII4E,"G.I. JOE was one of my favorite comic books and cartoon shows back in the 1980's! So, I now am used to the fact that whenever Hollywood reaches back for a childhood favorite, they usually get it half right and mess up the rest.

Now what did they got right for this movie?...SNAKE-EYES vs. STORM-SHADOW! For just the scenes of these two rival ninja brothers going at each other is worth taking a look at this film!

However, what did this G.I. JOE movie get wrong?..In ten words....""THE ROCK being the new leader of the G.I. JOES""!

Dwayne Johnson, the former WWE wrestling star, does an somewhat okay job playing ROADBLOCK, I guess. Yet, here's the main problem: ROADBLOCK  was a mid-tier G.I. JOE character. He was never ever in charge of the whole the G.I. JOE TEAM! ROADBLOCK, in the comics and in the classic '80's cartoon, was just an anti-convoy and anti-tank specialist! A cool character to blow stuff up and to buy you some time for your main offensive attack, but he wasn't nowhere to even being close to the field leader that DUKE was!

Killing off  DUKE, the real field leader of the G.I. JOE team, is like killing off CYCLOPS and PROF. XAVIER so that WOLVERINE, an extremely talented brawler but not a great strategist, can be the new leader of the X-MEN. It's like killing off OPTIMUS PRIME so that BUMBLE BEE can be the new leader of THE TRANSFORMERS! It's like killing off CAPT. AMERICA so that THE HULK can be the new leader of THE AVENGERS!..It's very lame! Very lame, indeed!

I don't know. This movie feels like ""THE ROCK"" is being shoved down my throat as ""the next movie action hero""! I groan whenever he's on the screen and I look at my watch to see what time it is. It's a shame, too, because I'm a big wrestling fan who loved ""THE ROCK"" in the ring. I think that's where he should be.

If ""THE ROCK"" (Dwayne Johnson) is the lead in the next G.I. JOE movie and they don't bring back DUKE or SCARLET, I'm jut going to have to dishonorably discharge G.I. JOE for lameness and a senseless waste of the movie studios' money in the face of really hard economic times, and  I am hereby restricting G.I. JOE from having any more active duty within the borders of my DVD collection!

The cliff notes of the experience are as follows. Channing Tatum gave his normal unexceptional performance while Bruce Willis practically slept through his scenes, which were thankfully short. If you are a fan of Dwayne Johnson this movie is a must see, as its two redeeming features are the fight choreography and Johnson's screen presence.

Oh, and England is completely destroyed, but we save France. Really, we save France at the expense of England? And how did Jonathan Pryce, a respected actor, get involved in this sort of thing? Not that I mind, he is the best thing about the movie, and given the best lines. And why not? He delivers them with gusto and class.

4816993,5,B005LAII4E,"Being a huge GI Joe fan (kid of the '80s) I'd always waited for a live action movie. In the '90s I got into the comic books and realized that there was some actual good story there and it was much darker and could easily make for a good film. The first movie was an abysmal disappointment, it was far too cheesy (think Transformers), too much comic relief, too many quadruple back-flips on motorcycles and other dumb things like that but they left out cool things like Cobra's iconic HISS tanks and such.

This film was almost a complete 180 degree turnaround. It was far more like the comic books and had some actual story to it as well as a few interesting twists. The cheese factor was dialed down to where it should be (yes, a movie like this SHOULD have some cheese, but it should be in subtle details, not in Matrix-esque action sequences), Dwayne Johnson delivered a solid performance and this time around Cobra actually seemed like a menacing force, not just some generic terrorists melting the Eiffel tower with generic green movie ""goo"".

Remember its based off a kids 80's cartoon show, which was based off a toy line- I'm not bashing any of those things- I grew up on them- and its was a fun time.  The movie is an action packed, ninja filled romp around the world.

There are moments- when the thought goes through your head- ""what the heck""- then you remember its a movie, based off a cartoon, where things were always ""wow thats so cool"".  Let me explain: The movie just brings the cartoon fantasy to live action, and to see some of the fight sequences and special effects brings out the ""what the heck"" thought from my adult brain, but also triggers the kid side of my brain with ""wow thats so cool""- thats what I mean.

This second round of Joes, does not seem as well rounded as the first batch (but thats really not saying much).  The movie has a ton of plot holes, and things get lost in the story line.  GI Joe was never meant to be a literary piece, just clean simple fun- nothing more and nothing less.

I've read different reviews (not all on this site)- ""they destroyed my childhood memories"".

I loved the first one and it seemed to me that it would surely be as good or better with the addition of Bruce Willis and The Rock (two of my favorite action movie actors).  Boy was I wrong.

I took several breaks because it just did not hold my attention.  My husband stopped watching it all together.  I had to force myself to finish it.

I don't like to do spoilers so I'm not giving too much details, but if you are a fan of Duke you will not like this movie at all.

It's not a bad flic, but nowhere near a great one.  It's just is.

The problem with this series was G.I. Joe was a pro American cartoon.  It was outlandish and over the top over patriotic U.S. ALL THE WAY.  That is what the kids of my generation where indoctrinated on every Saturday morning.  Don't believe me? Listen to the cartoons theme song.  Hell, the show was on USA network hosted by Sgt Slaughter.  Where am I going with this you ask? Easy, This movie series LOST all that, all the cornball charm of the cartoon when they dumped all the pro America overtones and marketed it to a world wide audience.  I feel because of that this movie series didn't do well because it didn't resonate with my generations memories of the show.

Bottom line.
If you seen the 1st one, this one picks up the story and does a good job continuing it.  The acting/actors are far better in this one and the CGI is much improved. It is not a bad movie, it just lacks the charm of the series it was based off of.",1382140800,,1095,4.186602870813397

4817322,4,B005LAII4E,"After the Transformers films made ALL the money, Hasbro would have been foolish not to filmically weaponize their other toy lines... And of course Hasbro's biggest toy line is G.I. Joe. So it was a shock to everyone, and probably Hasbro most of all, when G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra did not do very well. I could muse forever on why, but what it boils down to is that the movie was sort of a mess and cost way too much to make. Against all common sense, Hasbro decided to trot out a sequel, and in the process they achieved a rare feat indeed: a good sequel to a mediocre film.

Retaliation is a leaner film than its predecessor and I think that is to its advantage. While the first movie launched into crazy super-science right off the bat, Retaliation begins as a pretty plausible military thriller (albeit one with beautifully choreographed ninja fights, but still) and gradually works its way up to insane future warfare. As a result, when Dwayne Johnson's Roadblock (who sadly does not speak in rhyme) stages a one-man tank battle against a horde of Cobra H.I.S.S. tanks at the film's peak it seems like a really proper climax instead of still more silly action. What we do see of Cobra is more on model to the 80s cartoon as well, from Cobra Commander's outfit (shiny mask included) to their cartoonishly despotic plot for world domination which seems to consist of draping Cobra flags over everything and calling it a day.

Please don't misunderstand- if the first film turned you off with its over the top sci-fi army games, this one isn't going to win you back. The McGuffin is a satellite that collapses London, there's a bad guy named Firefly who kills people with exploding robot bugs and has a motorcycle made of missiles, and RZA plays a blind ninja master who makes the heroes steal each other's hairs blindfolded for practice. Retaliation simply doles out the crazy in smaller, better-planned doses and as a result makes its moments of fancy seem special instead of dumb.",1381622400,,1987,4.642045454545454

The show had good action, nothing too over-the-top (for a GI Joe flick), maybe it was because they spent so much time on Snake-Eyes and Stormshadow, or maybe it was too much plot, or too 'far out plot', or...well, I don't know.

Something about it just didn't 'drive my attention well', I lost focus in the show a couple of times, felt like continuity breaks, like 'I'd rather be online ordering a pizza than sitting here watching this right now' feeling. Not sure, for the weapons and fight scenes and A-list actors and solid acting, it just wasn't 'convincing', maybe?...

I got this at the 'Box Kiosk' locally, and am actually glad I didn't shell out $4 for a rental, I think I would have been upset if I had. at $1.25, I just write it off to 'Mt.

Yes there are several bits that are over the top but it was still a good watch.
 It has good replay value....unlike the Life of Pi that so many people were ranting about how awesome it was....it was a good show but not something that has any replay value. GI Joe is something the kids have seen several times...I have only seen it once so far.

If it wasn 't for him and The Rock, I would have only given it 2 stars.

I was upset slightly because of the plot where they killed off one of my favorite characters at the beginning. (No, I'm not going to spoil it, sheesh.) The writing was amusing and I am really glad they kept it at the level of kid friendly by not showing people dying or bleeding all over the place. It was a fun piece of fluff.
I would not show it to my children as they are both under the age of 6, but I think older kids might be able to handle it.

4817634,5,B005LAII4E,Kinda off book though killing off Duke like that. I realize the directors and what not had problems with the actor and that being the reason to kill duke off. They could have had him secretly kidnapped by cobra after the attack that kills him. But who knows what these Hollywood types are thinking when they do something like that in the movies anyway. To bad the kid that was to act for Duke got his head to high in the sky to get himself killed off on this when there for sure could be more films of this in the future as the cartoon series lasted for quite some time so there is room for more movies on this. As this movie series has long term potential. Other than that the show was excellent.,1379635200,3,697,4.17037037037037

If there are enough explosions and gun fights to keep me distracted, I can usually overlook bad or non-exsistent plots.  This movie kept me distracted. :-)  I was kind of shocked that a major character from the first movie is killed off so early in this one and actually stayed dead.  I kind of thought that pushing this back in the theaters to make it 3D was an excuse to change what happened to the character since the actor that portrays them was riding a huge wave of success at the time.

I like that style of movie so for me this film was OK.  The script and the action is what you would expect from this type of film.  It is sort of a B class of movie with a big budget and a lot of stars.  It certainly is entertaining and worth watching at least once.

There is no deep moral aspect to the film it is just made for action and entertainment and as long as you watch it with that aspect in mind you will enjoy it.  I rated it 4 stars as it was fun to watch.  It is one of those films that you can stream to your TV and enjoy but you don't necessarily need to buy the DVD.",1379203200,,742,3.7483870967741937

4817797,4,B005LAII4E,This film is great! It takes you from the former G.I. Joe and yet doesn't follow it so closely that you know what's coming. It did give me the feel however that as one major character is killed that they were going to bring him back somehow later? I didn't like the fact they never did. It should have been a little more definite a death. Unless that is they are leaving it open to bring him back in a later saga. Who knows?,1379030400,,424,4.059523809523809

4817840,4,B005LAII4E,"I saw this film when it came out and wondered how it would hold up on DVD. The answer is quite well. If for some reason you don't know what G.I.Joe is there was a set of toys in the 60s that consisted of 12"" tall dolls for guys based on the military put out by Hasbro. But they really took off in the 80s when they were made only 6"" tall and came with all sorts of characters, gadgets, vehicles and their own cartoon show. If you loved those toys you're almost certain to love the movies, especially G.I.JOE: RETALIATION.

This time around Cobra Commander is held prisoner along with Despero, both captured at the end of the first film. Commander's right hand man Zartan is posing at the U.S. President (Jonathan Pryce) thanks to nanomites, microscopic robots that make him physically appear to be him. As the film opens someone has killed the President of Pakistan and the ""President"" sends the Joes in to capture their nuclear bombs before terrorists can do so.

While this is going on a rescue attempt on Cobra Commander is in progress. I won't say much more than that so as to not ruin a few surprises here including the introduction of new Cobra member Firefly. Suffice to say it succeeds and the Commander is back in the saddle of all things evil once again.

Now led by Duke (Channing Tatum) the team drops in to take out the base and capture the nukes. Along with Duke are Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki), Flint (D.J. Cotrona) and several other Joes. They succeed in their mission only to be bombed and shot by a group of Cobra helicopters. Only Roadblock, Jaye and Flit survive. Afterwards the ""President"" blames the assassination on the Joes and outlaws any remaining members.

The three remaining teammates return to the states to find answers as to what happened. They know that the President was the only person with enough power to order their termination and set out to get more intell. Roadblock, now in charge, turns to the only man he trusts, the original G.I.Joe, Gen. Joe Cotton (Bruce Willis). If the team can get enough evidence to prove what is going on, Cotton and a few friends will help them save the country.

While this is going on Snake Eyes (Ray Park), the secretive ninja style Joe, is out to save the honor of his dojo and capture Storm Shadow. Climbing the peaks of a snow covered along with fellow good ninja Jinx (Elodie Young), they capture their prey and head out followed by Shadow's evil ninja bodyguards. What follows is an amazing fight sequence along the face of the mountain from ropes that has to be seen to be believed.

Once the Joes are reunited and sides are taken they are informed of what Cobra Commander is up to. As is always the case it involves world domination, blowing up well known locations and general mayhem. What it results in is a rip snorting good time filled with action, gadgets and those well love vehicles that fans of the cartoons and toys remember so well.

The movie offers exactly what you would expect, plenty of non-stop action, some thrilling fight sequences, lots of things blowing up and all those vehicles I mentioned. The new characters like Roadblock and Gen. Cotton mix in well with the ones from the first film and the bad guys are just as evil as you would expect. Are there plot holes or things that make no sense? Sure if you look for them. But instead just go in looking for that action that you love so well when it comes to these characters and movies.

There isn't a weak performance in this film. Everyone plays up to the standards you would expect for the Joe team and the bad guys. The effects that are on screen prove that this production put its money where its mouth was. By the end of the film if you aren't on the edge of your seat yelling for the Joe's to kick butt then something is wrong. You'll also find yourself witnessing something rare in films these days, an honest to goodness hero that can be looked up to. Granted, there is some rougher language used than in those old cartoons and people do get killed. But on the whole this is one action flick not to miss.",1378944000,,4091,4.489247311827957

I mean it started okay and then it transfered the ""Joes"" torch to the new guys aka the Rock and two actors I've never heard of or seen before who were awful. The scriptwriter was the worst offender. some lines were awful. This could be okay if you knew nothing about the GI Joes and wanted to see a movie with such unbelieveable action. The plot was thin and the action was so cgi I mean at least make it look real. I thought I was watching a play where the actors were being forced to read their lines. It was just trying to pay homage to too mny things and the plots were not related to the last movie. if it hadn't been hailed as the next movie for G.I. Joe and seperate then I might have had lower expectations. It was definitely not as good as the first, I agree it was okay mindlessness, the action scenes were awful. I expected more from Ray Stevenson and why does he try to have an American southern accent? The fight scene between him and The Rock was laughable. I have to say my favorite part of the movie was the WARDEN because Walter Goggins is a great actor delivered his lines with such sarcasm and I liked the time he was on the screen. The Snake Eye, Storm Shadow, Jinx part of the movie was just unnecessary.

And yes, there was even busty eye candy. Yet, it failed to amuse me or even hold my interest.

If any parents are wondering if this film would be ok for their kids, I found it to be alright for mine, a nine year old boy and a six year old girl. Be advised though, there are enough scene's that allow for the goggling of an attractive woman and enough killing that could disturb the younger crowd.

4818484,4,B005LAII4E,This summer was not filled with great action films but this does the trick.  It starts with action and ends with action.  Not much more to ask for in a summer movie!,1377648000,,165,4.125
4818485,3,B005LAII4E,"I wasn't a huge fan of G.I. Joe as a kid, and I did not like the previous film.  However, even a non-fan like myself has to admit the characters in the previous film and this one were nothing like the cartoon characters.  I mean, Cobra Commander doesn't have a very memorable voice in these films.  In the cartoon, his voice was annoying but very memorable.  I'm surprised they didn't stick to the cartoon voice for the fans.

Okay, with that out of the way, here are some pros and cons.  First, the cons. The writing sucks.  The story is very simple, and it is not told well.  The previous film had some twists that made it a little more interesting, and since it was more of an origin story, I liked it more.  However, it, too, was a bad story with bad writing.  I did not expect good writing, though, so this is overlooked by me while watching most of the movie.  I just can't help but think the writers were undeserving of their jobs, because there are some extremely dumb plot devices in this film.  Also, the characters from the first film either did not show up or were killed off at the beginning of the film, so this series has no consistency as far as characters go.

Now, the pros.  The film is action-packed.  There is a lot of high-flying, gun-toting action throughout the film.  That was the reason I bought it.  I like some of the action sequences.  Sure, the action scenes are poorly choreographed from time to time, and the ninjas aren't very stealthy, but it is fun to watch all the ridiculous action, anyway.  I mean, there are few films that actually offer this level of action.  Even The Expendables 2 left me wanting.  G.I. Joe: Retaliation simply gives me what I want and not much else.

Overall, I give it a 3/5.  It is a terrible movie in all areas except action.  It doesn't hype the action, either, so unless you just want to see The Rock, sorry, I mean Dwayne Johnson, fake-fight a few times and see some ninjas running around with high-tech grappling hooks, this is not the movie for you.  You may actually enjoy the ""Rise of Cobra"" movie a little more.  I recommend renting it rather than buying it.",1377648000,,2129,4.394871794871795

I'll simply say that Bonaventura and Chu deviated from the GI Joe canon about as far as they could without making Snake Eyes a 12 year old girl that wears a tutu and hands out daisies on the street corner.
Well done, producer and director.  You both just solidified the fact that I will never watch another of your movies.  (With the exception of anything Transformers from Bonaventura, since there is a new one in the works.  Chu has never directed or produced anything of substance anyway.)

If you're not hard to please with an action film, you might like it. But, this film seemed to want to win over its audience with lots of explosions and a few well-known actors. Unfortunately, I found myself so bored that I paused the film so I could wash the dishes piled-up in my kitchen sink. I was more involved in that than I was watching the movie.

The first movie was terrible and was not even going to watch this one but after I heard they changed the entire movie I gave it a shot thinking they would have learned from the first one boy was I wrong.

It was a perfect action movie when I just wanted to zone out a little while my insomnia worked itself out.  That said, I was disappointed that the majority of the actors in the first movie were either not there or eliminated from the second movie. Growing up with the comics, we all know Duke was the main figure and the source of our nostalgia or at least it was for me.  I like Duane Johnson in low plot action movies but he just didn't cut it when I was geared up to watch ""Duke"" in action.  I did like the ending scene where his character resolved his friends' death.  (Probably still a spoiler but I tried to keep it vague and you can figure out what's coming pretty early in the movie.) It wasn't a memorable movie by any means and I will probably forget what it's about or if I even watched it in a few years.  However, it did the job entertainment-wise so I give it 3 stars.

4818761,4,B005LAII4E,"Despite the widely publicized negative reviews of the first G.I. Joe film, I enjoyed it and I also enjoyed G.I. Joe Retaliation.  The plot line moves along at a healthy pace, the opening of the film gives a brief summation of events that have occurred since the first film and a short bio of the main characters.  While I was disappointed that *SPOILER ALERT* they killed off the main character of Duke, I understood it was a plot point to help serve the motivation of the characters in the story.

I understand that Hollywood, like any business, has to go where it gets the best value for its money - that said the biggest disappointment for the film, for me, was when the story moved to Fort Sumter in South Carolina for a nuclear summit of world leaders.  I was born and raised in South Carolina and have visited Fort Sumter many times, so I was dismayed to see that it was not Fort Sumter featured in the film - but instead was Fort Pike in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Again, I get that Louisiana probably afforded Hollywood the best price break to film there, but it would have been nice to have had the story at least be adjusted to reflect that it was not Fort Sumter they were going to.

All of this being said, the story was exactly what one would expect from a summer movie, lots of action, great special effects, and explosions that deliver as advertised.",1377129600,,1363,4.432

It's hard seeing named actors (The Rock, Bruce Willis etc..) being the characters I used to play with as a kid. They could've used new actors and got the same if not better results, and saved a ton of money! The story isn't bad, but they kill off Joes by the dozen. I wish they would've stuck more to the old scripts, and the CGI in this one wasn't bad but I miss the old days of realistic fight scenes.

But, this is just my opinion. You should watch this with your kids, enjoy it, and make up your own opinion. It's worth buying.",1377043200,,695,4.072992700729927

4818892,1,B005LAII4E,"****SPOILER ALERT****

I was a fan of the original movie, even though many who claimed they hated it, actually enjoyed it alot more than they let on (the box-office returns don't lie!)

The first movie was a not-too serious fantasy actioner with the occasional cheesy nod & wink to both the cartoon and toy line from the `80s. Even when our heroes or world civilians were in peril, there was a light-hearted, fun tone that flowed throughout the movie. Unfortunately, that tone is now completely gone from this movie.

Apparently the studios listened to the critics a little too much this time around, since they gutted what was a potentially fun action-fantasy franchise and made this film into nothing more than a generic Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson/Bruce Willis action movie.

Gone are pretty much all the characters from the first movie, except for the two main villans, played by different actors this time around, which didn't really matter since their screen time is limited to about five minutes in the entire movie. Even perennial under-actor Channing Tatum (the man cannot emote!), playing the ""main"" G.I. Joe character Duke, is killed off on-screen front and center within the first 20 minutes of the film. After that, the downward spiral continues. There are no more grand G.I. Joe or Cobra base sets or cool nano-mite or pulse-shock weaponry that we saw in the first film.

The characters are now very generic and boring, and just there to connect each cut/paste quick edit action sequence to the next. Since you don't care about anyone in the movie, it just goes on and on and on. After the first 30 minutes, my movie companion and I both found ourselves watching the clock to see when it would end. We were tempted several times to shut it off, but decided to endure the rest of it just because we knew neither one of us would ever watch it again.

This was a blind-buy on Amazon and I really regret purchasing it before seeing the movie first.",1376956800,,1956,4.721407624633431

Old fans will see it regardless, heck the GI Joe movie reference is zero or some long cartoon/s (prior to this recent franchise).  I liked the characters and use of them. This movie is great for hotel and plane viewing, simple, fun and not serious.",1376870400,,386,4.436619718309859
4818896,4,B005LAII4E,I thought the movie was good.  My son loved it.  I was disappointed in the beginning - I won't say why for those that have not watched it yet.  It was a GI Joe movie.,1376784000,,166,3.6857142857142855
4818987,3,B005LAII4E,"I had not seen the original ""G. I. Joe"" but my teen aged son told me this one is much better, so I decided to buckle up.  I'll say this.  People looking for a complicated plot, or complicated characters, or character development, or well scripted dialog, or logic, or science, or reasonableness please don't waste your time.  You get a sense for all of this right off the bat.  The president has ordered the ""Joes"" (that's what they're called) to go to North Korea and rescue some guy that is being held prisoner and return him to the U. S.  From the time the order is given to the time it took to be back in the U. S. A. took 7 minutes if I'm not mistaken.

So goes the rest of the film as the ""Joes"" fight the evil ""Cobras"" who have managed to replace the president for evil purposes.  So we get lots of explosions, killing, fighting, shooting, stabbing, things getting blown up, chases, wrecks, crashes and did I mention explosions?  All within the PG-13 check list, of course.  So here is the good stuff.  There is a terrifically staged and executed scene where a pair of Ninjas (Snake Eyes & some hot chick in yellow) go up a frozen mountain to get one of their former compatriots (now a bad guy) and bring him back home.  There is some very tricky camera and stunt work involved as a horde of bad guys in red suits try to kill the 2 good guy/gal.  It's all very cool.

The Blu ray transfer is very special also.  It comes with a 1080p video resolution and is of demo grade.  The colors are beautiful and there is every color imaginable from bright yellow to red to some wonderful blacks.  The facial detail is remarkable.  Sweat, hair, pores all clearly defined.  It doesn't get any better than this.  The audio as well is perfect.  This time we have a Dolby TrueHD 7.1 and boy is it a doozy.  From the beginning to the end, all the speakers fill up with great, clear, perfectly balanced audio.  Subs will get a work out as well.  This, again is demo grade stuff.  Extras include a commentary track with the director and producer, 8 short (8-10 min.) featurettes under the banner of ""G.I. Joe: Declassified,"" some deleted scenes, a DVD and a digital copy.",1376784000,,2161,4.371859296482412

I am being a little nice here with giving this film 4 stars because it had pretty cool, graphics, stunts, cool weaponry and machines.
This film fell way flat for me though in regards to the first one. The first joe had channing and marlyon and there was a lot of energy and excitement. This sequel *spoilers* wrote channing out, didn't even have marlyon and basically was just all about dwayne johnson. With that bad taste in my mouth being said it was a decent film. The first half was a little slow but it picks up the second half of the movie. I kept thinking channing tatum would somehow come back in the film but the producers obviously just wanted dwayne johsnon in it. Probably because of not wanting to pay actors salaries, which is usually why they have to cast b-list actors. Even though I may consider dwayne j. an a list actor i was expecting a lot more out of this sequel and was let down / disappointed. But if i woudl have seen this film as a separate film it would have been ok. I don't know what is up with hwood movies lately feeling very generic and stale but you can just pop out any piece of garbage and think it's going ot be the next blockbuster.
Not else is to be said about this film. I would wait until this movie comes out on tv instead of paying any money for it. Thanks for reading. Godbless

The guy who plays the president is really having fun. All of the bad guys are awesome and really do steal this movie from the heroes. This is what I wish the transformer movies were...fun but in the end the script makes decent sense. Cobra has a great evil plan and actually does pull 90% of it off. Time for a Weather Dominator!!!

4819046,1,B005LAII4E,"Like many other's stated in their reviews, I also stopped watching mid-movie.
If you're familiar with the GI Joe stories and a fan, you will be greatly disappointed.
Writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick should be sat in a Hollywood Dunce Chair after this epic fail. Why?

Spoiler alerts follow:
The iconic main character that generations grew up with, ""Duke"" and almost entire squad was killed off right away.
Snake-eyes wardrobe makes him look like a cyborg rather than the more typical ninja-like character. (Ugh.)
Snake-eyes is awesome character with unique talents, and suddenly Lady Jaye also fights with similar talents alongside him??? (Great job of de-glorifying a character writers.)
Some of the acting was not so great, and felt too forced by some characters.

It felt like the writers stripped away all the joy we grew up with, and scrambled to make another typical military sci-fi movie, i.e, destroyed the nostalgia and gave back a movie that no longer reaches its audience. Moreover, felt like they destroyed the storyline just to give new cast member Dwayne Johnson the leading role. Don't get me wrong, I like some of his movies, but this is overkill.",1376697600,5,1167,4.97948717948718

I expected an entertaining action flick, short on plot, with plenty of fight scenes and explosions, just brainless fun.  G.I. Joe Retaliation has plenty of action, but there's something missing.  I found myself bored, easily distracted, and not entertained at all.  In fact, it was so tedious, that I couldn't bring myself to finish the movie.  I wish I had paid more attention to the Rotten Tomato ratings, where nearly half of users were disappointed.

Led by Duke (Channing Tatum), the team emerges from many of its battles unscathed. But the team is betrayed by the government, and Snake Eyes (Ray Park) is framed for the death of the Pakistani president.

After an intense attack on the GI Joes, the surviving soldiers -- Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Jaye (Adrianne Palicki), and Flint (D.J. Cotrona) -- must find out who has betrayed them and retaliate for the murder of their comrades. Their investigation leads them all the way up to the President of the United States (Jonathan Pryce).

Based on a series of toys, the film is more a living comic book than a feature picture, with action abounding, muscled heroes proliferating, and a streamlined plot geared to discourage too much thinking. It seems aware of its own silliness and geared to ten-year-old boys or anyone who values mayhem over plot.

I know the movie is supposed to be an action fluff piece, but it does not have to be this...nothing.

All the right pieces are in play but it seemed more like a stroll through ""what was shot"" rather than a complete movie. The last half hour is the only time I cared what was happening and while the mountain climbing/descent was a cool scene, it could have easily been a promotion for ""Ka"" (Las Vegas). A lot could have been gained by revisiting the themes from Rise of Cobra; flashbacks to scenes from the first movie would have significantly helped emphasize Cobra's grasp and any indication that they actually have power. However, all of the buildup to Cobra Commander being a complex character get completely ignored because now, as long as we show that he walks cool (and slightly femininely), he can effortlessly ride off to a moon base or elsewhere.

The only downside I hated about this movie, is that Channing Tatum's character, Duke, is killed off at the very beginning, just like everyone else.  After surviving huge next-generation starships, master assassins, Rex (aka Cobra Commander), Destro, and nanomites, he is killed by a simple explosion, leaving all the work to his best pal to stop Cobra.  That was the biggest mistake in the film.  The very reason it has three stars!

But despite Duke's death, the movie has turned out to be amazing film and a great sequel to the first G.I. Joe movie.  The Rock and Bruce Willis bring out great characters and do their best to save the world.  Along with pretty familiar characters and a good storyline, our heroes are back to deliver one awesome take down on Cobra!

The first film will always be my favorite, but to those who say this movie sucked, it actually wasn't bad.  I mean, we have Snake Eyes back and The Rock taking the lead now.  Yes, Duke dies and Storm Shadow's story gets confusing, but the movie was pretty good.  The fight scenes were badass and the characters were amazing.  But as always, the first film was better and nothing will change that.

Joe fan and you like the original cartoons the cobra commander in this one actually looks like cobra commander from the cartoons. So that was a big selling point for me on this one also and the action the snake eyes, storm shadow and Jinks, but is totally awesome. So 10 stars out of 10 I will have to give it a 9 1/2 stars. Is it worth to $20. Maybe it's totally on you guys if you want to buy it or not, but Amazon video on command. I say this was really good.

Pros: This movie has a ton of action, twists and turns and great character moments. The plot is very good and I like that they focus mainly on the fact that Zartan is impersonating the President. Dwayne Johnson is a favorite of mine as is Bruce Willis so it is really good to see them in this movie. This movie has great CGI special effects and they blend into the story, help tell the story, without overpowering the story. This movie could have easily turned into a CGI laden video game but it does not. I think the presence of Dwayne Johnson really carried this movie and the central theme of this movie is all about redemption. Although we see Cobra Commander and his gang of evil doers retaliate for the defeat they experienced in the first movie. In truth this movie is about the redemption of the Joes, The President and Storm Shadow. I found a great deal of heart in this movie.

Cons: Although I really did like this movie it felt detached from the first movie in some ways. Maybe that has to do with the fact that so few of the actors from the first movie returned for this movie. This film introduces us to many new faces. Plus, this movie seemed smaller in scale than the previous film. Those two elements make the movie feel very different from the first movie. Although I really like this movie I could never shake that sense of this film feeling so different from the other film.

I recently published a blog post that mentions how the tone of comic-book movie should be. G.I. Joe: Retaliation is a great example of a comic book style movie that strikes the right tone or verisimilitude. It doesn't take itself too seriously. It is not campy but yet the humor, the macho bravado within the film does let us know that this is going to be a fun movie...and it is. This movie is about redemption, friends and standing by those friends who need our help. The movie is also over-the-top in places with its action scenes but they are fun to watch. It is almost like watching an action oriented well choreographed dance unfold before your eyes.

G.I. Joe: Retaliation is a fun popcorn munching escapism type movie filled with a lot of heart, fun, and interesting characters wrapped up in exciting science-fiction and action and adventure tale.",1376092800,,2481,4.518930957683741

Bruce Willis is always a treat, except for this film, I wanted to understand that this was a vehicle for Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock, sadly he left the heavy lifting to up and comers in the film, those with actor training.

4819779,3,B005LAII4E,"The movies characters are top notch as listed, but as in a few other movies the growing trend is to put the big names on the cover then have them play a minimal role for only a short bit of play time, then they are no longer in the entirety of the rest of the film. Very frustrating!! When we look for movies to watch there are a few steps to our selection process. First we see the title, then we see who is in it (actors & actresses), then the theme of the film lastly. So even a bad action movie with the right characters can be a great flick. However , a action movie is just an action movie without the right actors & actresses to play the great roles to make the movie great, follow my thinking?! So see for yourselves, if you leave thinking (WTF?!) like I did then you get where I am coming from, if not then good for you! It would seem as though they did this very recently with the same person in another film of late too, with the same result in my eyes anyway! You see if you feel the same though, let me know.

Go watch this movie, it's awesome as it was meant to be. Don't trust people who critic a movie just because they don't like this kind of movie, not because of the movie itself. It's just not relevant.

The story didn't flow, the acting was horrible (I think they paid old Brucie to be there), the ""badass action"" just got ever so uninteresting...

If there was any redeeming quality, is the delightfully attractive Adrianne Palicki who's red dress appearance will stop many hearts for some time to come.

Unlike the first, the sequel was plagued by productions issues that delayed the film for months on end, and honestly... the wait was not worth it.

Now, don't take me wrong.  The film is worth an afternoon.  Guns, explosions, silly one liners, bad jokes, and more guns.  If you like such films, it is a nice way to waste roughly 2 hours.  But, if you like such films you know you aren't getting much mental engagement or anything resembling character development or story.  It is what it is and doesn't try to be anything else.

Now, for my weak point.  I am a sucker for a good sword play sequence and I must say, the scenes between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow are certainly a redeeming quality in this film.  Not the best I have ever seen, but the sword fights (especially the short one in the hallway) are a nice little treat for the eyes.

The female actess Jaye was the only good thing in this movie really. Very pretty

Bruce Willis, barely in it. same goes for Cobra Commander.

This was a downgrade from the original & even both of those are not on the same level as the 80s animated movie.
go see that. its better x1000000000000",1375833600,,583,4.37037037037037
4819997,2,B005LAII4E,"I am very disappointed with this lastest film; Lots of action; a lot of fighting, punching, chasing, and tons of explosions...They destroyed a whole major city.  But there was no substance. It deserves the rotten tomatoe award I feel that they left the plot on the cutting room floor. This was suppose to be the comeback of the Cobra-Cobra wanting to take over the world and the Joe's the savior of the world. This was horrible, like a two bit dime movie. Wait unitl it comes on t.v. don't waste your money. Better yet buy the comic book and it will do a better job than the director of this film...",1375833600,,599,4.396396396396397
4819998,1,B005LAII4E,"*Sigh*... Much in the same way the Mission Impossible movies quickly became all about Tom Cruise, GI Joe looks like it's becoming all about the Rock.  It isn't about the team, it's about the individual... and the hot chick that follows him, of course, whose only inclusion is to flaunt her body to sucker in the bad guys.  Seriously?  GI Joe: Retaliation started out strong but quickly fizzled out after the first ten minutes or so.  The plot lines seemed rushed, the set-up inexplicably complicated for the short time their crammed in, yet the resolutions so sudden and simple that they may as well have been left out.  I can appreciate a nod to the fans and the backstories, but don't jam it awkwardly in just for lack of enough actual story to make a movie.  The stories are thrust at the audience without even a pretense of mystery, without experiencing the journey of discovery with the characters.  Cobra was just sort of phoned in.  World domination, okay, fine, whatever.  This movie is juvenile in the sense that it could have been a good movie, but instead wandered off into the realm of underdeveloped plots, shallow characters, and the continuous questions of ""When did that happen and why didn't anyone notice?""  There are a lot of these questions presented, particularly about Cobra, that are never even attempted to be accounted for.  They have the technology, they have the guy on the inside, they always have their minions fully armed and prepaired to take control, and no one ever suspects something is amiss except for our main characters.  That's just the way it is, no explainations offered.  It expects its audience as well as its characters to shrug their collective shoulders at the presented story and say ""Sure, why not?  Let's just go with that.""  A good movie -- whether made for kids or adults -- involves the viewer in the journey and growth of its characters.  This movie doesn't even try.  Granted this wasn't made to be an Oscar-winning movie, nor would it ever be mistaken as such.

  Sure, the action was decent and the 3D was okay, but not enough to call it a ""fun"" movie worth watching more than once.  And why base a new movie on a franchise that has been around for DECADES only to completely change it with only the names of characters to lend any resemblence to the original?  If so much is changed to the point of the new having little or nothing akin to the old, (like killing off a main character, for instance) then why not just create something entirely original?  Could it be that if not for the love of those of us who grew up with GI Joe, it's likely no one would ever watch a movie like this let alone give it a good review?  It has nothing to give it any merit save its affiliation with and capitalizaion on a beloved childhood memory.  I'm so disappointed in these movies now, I don't even want to see the third one when it comes out.  The 3D and PG-rated action isn't worth sitting through the absurd plot or bad acting.

But then, I hated the new Star Trek movie as well for what was done to the integrity of the original story and characters so painstakingly established and belovedly familiar, so....  If you liked that, you'll probably like this.",1375833600,8,3203,4.571929824561403

4820052,4,B005LAII4E,"I will never understand my fellow moviegoers and critics. When you go see a movie like GI Joe, what exactly does one expect to see? While, I only saw it once, I walked away from it actually loving the heck out of it. Yes, I recognize that from a pure craft standpoint the movie was seriously flawed. But I don't go to a GI Joe movie looking for craft. I go looking to be entertained, to watch a cartoon that I loved as a kid brought to life and see the property be treated with a modicum of respect. On that basis the first GI Joe delivered everything that I wanted.  But the movie was a critical and (I thought, apparently wrong, Box Office failure) so I was shocked and pleasantly surprised to find that a sequel was in the works.

This movie delivered just about everything that I would want out of a GI Joe movie. The weapons were futuristic and advanced enough to put a smile on my face, yet remain ""realistic"" enough where I would go, yes - I totally buy into the idea that Cobra ""Bats"" (Helicopters with convertible Jet Engines) were possible, or that Firefly's (Ray Stevenson) swarm of miniature exploding robot fireflies could be real.

I like that, like the cartoon, the balance between Cobra and the Joes are maintained. In the Cartoon Cobra is usually winning the battle for most of the episode until some key mistake or bit of arrogance by Cobra Commander (Luke Bracey) ruins the plan. In Retaliation it isn't arrogance that ultimately brings the plan down, it is actually the intelligence of The Joes sorting out what is going on and what happened.  In many ways Retaliation is a very ""logical"" procedural movie disguised as popcorn action.

I'm not saying there aren't ridiculous moments, like the over the top cliff battle with Snake Eyes (Ray Park), his protg Jinx (Elodie Yung), a literally wrapped up Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) and a whole bunch of Ninjas. Great, fun stuff.  The movie missed mightily with the god awful, comical presence of (RZA) as the Blind Master or surprisingly Bruce Willis as the original Joe - Commander Joe Colton. He just didn't seem interested in what he was doing and his character was annoyingly condescending.

Dwayne Johnson continues to have a great year, this time as the popular character Roadblock.  Johnson never really acts all that differently in films, but he certainly has the charm and presence to make almost anything he does work. He manages to be able to poke fun at himself and those around him, without ever destroying his credibility as the resident ""tough"" guy.  I loved the rest of this cast, Adrianne Palicki was great as Lady Jaye, Jonathan Pryce was fun as the fake version of himself as President. At times I really did think he was Zartan (Arnold Vosloo).

Director Jon M. Chu does a nice job of keeping the movie flowing, evenly paced and most of the action scenes are well staged with no shaky cam and everything was easy to follow. The screenplay by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick was solid. I really don't understand the vitriolic reaction some people have for this movie. It is a summer popcorn flick, not everything has to be a serious deconstruction of a post apocalyptic future. Sure, if you overthink this movie, you could find flaws - but that's the case with any piece of entertainment. Enjoy it for what it is, not what you think it should be. It is one of my top 10 favorites of 2013.

Presentation, Audio, Video

From the top level you can select whether you want to be a Joe or a member of Cobra. The presentation layer changes based on your selection for Joes you get blues and clips of Joes for your screensaver while the Cobra layer is draped in red and includes clips of Cobra. Obviously the Cobra layer is the cooler one.  The disc comes in standard jewel case packaging with a 3D slipcase. There are 3 discs - 3D Blu-ray, Blu-ray and DVD version. All the extras are on the Blu-ray Disc. Have I said recently how much this annoys me? I really like having the 3D and 2D movie on the same disc.

I wasn't a fan of the 3D in the theater, but, as usual, in a home environment on my nice Vizio Passive 55 incher the 3D is fairly solid, can't really complain about it. The 2D version is even better and sharper thanks to the 1080p transfer. I'm still and will never be a fan of letter boxed widescreen - I have a 55-inch tv, fill that puppy up!  The 7.1 Dolby TrueHD audio was nice, although it seemed like most of the audio mix was on the front center track and didn't make a lot of use of the rear channels.

Audio tracks include - French/Spanish/Portuguese Dolby Digital 5.1 HD, English Audio Description. Subtitles are in English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese

Extras

  Previews
  Full length Commentary by Director Jon M. Chu
  G.I. Joe: Declassified - 8 Featurettes that cover the making of the movie and total over one hour
  Deleted Scenes - 3 Scenes that total about 4 mins.
  DigitalUV - is both iTunes and Ultraviolet compatible (I wish more studios do this - I'm looking at YOU Disney!)

Conclusion

I don't care what anyone says, I love this movie. On first blush it seems like there are no extras on this disc, look deeper and you'll see it includes a full Commentary, basically a 1 hour documentary that covers all aspects of making this movie and a Digital Copy for both iTunes and Ultraviolet. As a fan of the movie, I really can't complain too much about this release. It is solid.

Just wasn't worth it. And btw, the movie was pretty ho hum. Had no issues with the first GI Joe, but aside from a few clever action scenes this one is just anti-exciting. Ho hum acting.

Yes, there's a lot of action and big explosions...but the Joe characters from the first movie are all absent, minus Channing Tatum, WHO IS KILLED IN THE FIRST 20 MINUTES OF THE MOVIE!  I understand what they were going for, Roadblock needed to be set up as the new leader of the Joes.  But come on, how can they kill off Duke!?!?  And where are the rest of the Joes from the first movie?  I missed the one liners from Mr. Wayons.  I loved Scarlett's kick butt attitude.  I think what most bothered me about this movie (and there were a lot if things) is that it is a 'sequel' that has basically turned into a totally different movie.  There was a lack of chemistry with the actors and a beyond ridiculous story.  I can't believe I wasted 2 hours of my life and $3.99 renting it.

so, if you have not seen it yet, then click away from here.....

okay......the movie was okay, but it had quite a few holes in it. For starters, how in the heck did storm shadow survive after falling into the arctic waters after his fight with snake eyes? I saw him fall into the water when the cobra subs were starting to bug out. Maybe I messed it in this movie, but I believe I didn't. I only see him at this ""underground base"" wearing snake eyes costume. On that note #2......Cobra Commander and destro were locked away in a maximum security prison under the watchful eyes of the joes...only to reappear in a European prison under the command of some idiot? This made absolutely no sense to me.....

#3......The Joes were supposedly taken out during an attack. Where in the heck were the Joes from the first film? Where was Scarlet? Heck, where was Dukes partner in this movie? Where was the high-tech Cobra jet at? Where was Dukes girlfriend at after the first movie? Where was the general from the first one? (Dennis Quaid) UGGGHHH!! By doing this, the directors cut away several storylines that were developing. heck, I would have liked another Cobra Base to be in this movie!!

#4......The President being guarded by cobra units yet I didn't see any mind control going on.
#5......Cobra commander. I liked how he had his original GI Joe style helmet but still didn't seem to make a big impact.
#6......Destro gets left behind...why?
#7......Storm Shadow's master was killed by Zartan? WHAT?????
#8......Duke getting killed off early.....I guess we will never find out about the ""baroness"" fate

Well, it seems to me that the Rock and Bruce Willis want to get a paycheck....because Willis doesn't seem to gel into this type of movie. It's a little different then Die Hard movies.

The movie goes on its typical role....the good guys track down the bad guys, the good guys find the true identity of the president, and then go for the rescue to save the world....

One thing that pisses me off in these type of movies is how fast the bad guys get taken out, like the bad guys have no training whatsoever. These 5 just mop the floor with them too easily....and the enemy always seem to fall into their hands right at the most opportune times. And of course, the one second left abort has been played over several times before.

Overall, Duke and the Rock had some laughs, Snake eyes..well, still didn't say a word.....and the Joes kicked some Cobra butt.

But, what i would have liked to see was more of a story in this one, like we saw in the first film. Stories didn't develop, and it was mostly action scenes. I was disappointed that it wasn't more of what it should have been....I was disappointed with all my anticipation after the first film.

But, for the sake of the human race, here I go.

I imagine the pitch for this movie went something like this:
""OK OK, we want a scene where London blows up, then another scene where Snake Eyes gets in a fight on the side of a mountain, throw some space super weapons, then, to top it off, we'll throw in Bruce Willis!""
""Why?""
""Because Bruce Willis! Oh, and then use whatever money we have leftover to string all those scenes together with one of those things we used to make...what were they called again?""
""A story?""

These were characters I enjoyed and that the first movie spent time to develop. If your a fan of Channing Tatum, he only makes a cameo.

I never saw the first film but was still able to follow this movie without feeling as if I had really missed a lot, which was nice.

The film did surprise me in at least one major part towards the beginning and though I felt the addition of ""The Rock"" was solid casting choice I didn't care much for the fact Road Block pretty much took over the film.

The 3D has a few very nice pop out scenes,though 3D depth is pretty much obsolete for most of the film. A few scenes looked brilliant in 3D,while others appeared as missed opprotunities. It's almost worth giving the 3D a 4 out of 5 but it falls just short of being something great,which is a shame.

If you're a fan of action films you can't go wrong here. GI Joe Retaliation has it all. Fist to fist,blade to blade,bullet to bullet. The only falter in the action is that while it has it all,it still leaves you wanting more by not having nearly enough of it.",1375574400,,1074,4.333333333333333

I'm assuming they are mostly from kids under 30 that just love the Rock and know nothing about Gi Joe. In my opinion,this was not even a Gi Joe movie. Did it have action,yes,but what happened to the continuation of the story? It could have been so good. Instead they throw a couple of A list actors in,some good action and hope it draws a crowd.. Anyone that knows anything about Gi Joe,is that they are 3 levels ahead of the military. This was clearly shown in the 1st movie,none of which was in the 2nd. They dumbed the 2nd one down. When Cobra initially attacked Duke and Ripcord in the 1st movie,it was a wtf moment. The tech was so superior to what the marines had. Everything that made the 1st one good ,was not present in the 2nd one. I wanted to see what happens to Destro and Cobra commander next. I wanted to see more tech. I do have to say the satellite tech was really cool. The fight on the mountains was cool too. But why not bring back the original cast and continue the story.. What a disappointment! Stephen Sommers directed the 1st one,the 2nd one was directed by someone else,now I understand how it got messed up.

4820314,4,B005LAII4E,"I feel I need to review this movie based on what it's meant to be - a live action combination of the comic book and cartoon series from the 1980's.

This movie hits those marks better than G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra with more GI Joe and Cobra style vehicles, weapons, and scenes.  One can imagine a comic book cover with the Cobra flag unfurled over the White House or Road Block driving that tracked vehicle fighting tanks with turrets that rise like a cobra's head!  Great visuals and some fun scenes.

And what a great comic book premise to have all the major world leaders in one room using their own 'nuclear footballs"" simultaneously in the ultimate game of brinkmanship!

To enjoy this movie, one must set aside all expectations of reality - America's response to what's happening, a total absence of Congress and the Supreme Court, the military's willingness to follow wacky Presidential orders, and even the laws of physics.

The biggest downside to this movie is the death of several main characters - both good and bad.  I don't remember such permanent endings to many of the comic books or any of the 80's cartoon episodes.  While I didn't expect this movie to end with ""Knowing is half the battle"" sequences, I was surprised with where it went because I assume it did well enough to merit a third installment in the series.",1375574400,,1337,4.6118143459915615
4820315,2,B005LAII4E,"Preliminary Comments...

After checking in with his right hand man, Michael Bay... Mr. Lorenzo di Bonaventura ordered all stops pulled and gave the green light to use up whatever pyrotechnics had not been used in the Transformers franchise in this, the latest installment in the G.I. Joe saga.  Sadly... as has become the beaten path in Hollywood, I am sure that there will be a third installment.  Unfortunately, because they blew everything up with the materials they had in this film, future writing will have to take a hit... Not that it possibly could, as I think that I imagined more creative G.I. Joe scenarios in my childhood years than was stitched together in the editing room of Paramount Studios.  However, in fairness... if you like Dwayne Johnson's bulging biceps and Adrianne Palicki's over-promoted bosom coupled with overpaid cameos featuring Bruce Willis and Channing Tatum.  This is your film.

The Stars...

Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson.  I will always smell what The Rock is cooking.  He's had some decent films in his career.  Think Fast Five and perhaps Faster.  Let's all forget Doom.  As Roadblock, he turns in a decent performance as a leading man.  But, when considering what he is being asked to do in this otherwise disappointing big budget catastrophe, that's not asking much.  Again, not faulting him for signing onto the project... but, his acting certainly got no help from the writing staff.

Byung Hun Lee.  Definitely a lot of potential for the Storm Shadow character... if the production staff would remove themselves from the set and say ""Byung, you are an awesome actor in your own right... just adlib/improvise.  It will be better than we came up with.""  Notwithstanding the monkeying on the part of director and entourage, he turns in an acceptable performance.  And if you're a lady, don't worry.  There are plenty of shots that would make even the most avid Wolverine/Hugh Jackman fan say ""Put a shirt on, for crying out loud.""

Jonathan Pryce.  He's fallen a long way from selling me Infinitis and foiling Pierce Brosnan with his nefarious plans for world domination.  I can't complain.  He had to play two roles.  And he only had enough character development written for one.  Sensing a pattern here, yet?

Adrianne Palicki.  Who?  You might be saying.  I don't know.  A few chaotic scenes into the film that come after an awkward slide show force-feeds you all the requisite information you need to digest the toddler-created plot, she becomes one of the faces hogging up screen time.  Critic's note here... in the interests of being somewhat impartial I should note that I did find her attractive.  That being said, I don't think that her acting skills had much to do with her role/part.  I would like to see if she could pull off a more serious role that didn't focus so much of John Chu's camera time on her cleavage.  But instead... someone, somewhere in the studio said... ""Hey, we have too many dudes in this film.  We need to add some ladies.  Otherwise this is just G.I. Joe: The Expendables.""

Channing Tatum.  Yeah.  I'm not sure if you can really list him as a star in this film.  I won't mention why.  No, actually I will.  And if you still choose to watch the film, don't come crying to me when you find out that he's only in the first quarter (if even that) of the film.  If you're looking for more Channing action, go rent Magic Mike.  And then you won't miss him at all in the remainder of this film.

Bruce Willis.  Or General ""Joe"" Colton who is the original inspiration for being called ""Joes"" even though he was never mentioned in the first film... at all.  On an aside, I think that Bruce must have bumped into Nicholas Cage at some point recently who informed Bruce that it doesn't really matter what the quality of the films is that you sign onto... you still get paid regardless.  And so, in an endless series of near fiascos, Bruce tacks this one onto his CV after turning in decent performances in films like RED and Moonrise Kingdom.  Please note that he will not be reprising classic Willis awesomeness like we saw in Sixth Sense and Die Hard (but only the first three).

The Plot...

Sadly, there were some fairly opportune moments for this fledgling story to leap off the pages of a teenage fanfic writer's high school notebook...  But, the team that Mr. di Bonaventura got together decided to selectively pick and choose what they wanted to lift from the first film and run with that.  I'm not sure that they realized a need to improve upon it and embellish it somewhat.  And, there might be more to it... like an inability to sign some of the talent from the first flop.  Err, I mean film.  But, I suppose when you have people like Christopher Eccleston snub you... you're probably not going to be expecting greatness out of this film.

So... the actual plot.  Cobra is on the lamb.  They've been getting theirs handed to them because the Joes are super awesome.  This sounds a lot like Transformers.  Hmm.  But wait!  There was that hanging chad we left in Florida... I mean, that loose end from the first film.  Oh, that naughty Zartan.  Impersonating the President.  Then we take a turn from two-dimensional to one dimensional thinking when the writers decide... ""Hey, let's have the 'President' just eliminate the Joes... And it will setup the most epic revenge plot, ever!""  So what should we call this... hmmm... Retaliation?

No guys, that's just what I'm calling my review after sending my $5 to Amazon to see it.

Over/Under/My Recommendation...

If you're really bored.  And you have seen just about everything else on Demand.  Give it a go.  Because obviously you're not in it for quality if you have rented that many films.  Otherwise, wax philosophically on your childhood years playing with G.I. Joes and watching the cartoons... which may have had better writing than this film.  In some ways, this film make the fanboys that produced AVP Requiem look professional, and that takes some skill.

Bottom line... save your money.  It'll be in the ""Great Movies for $1"" bin at Wal-Mart by Christmas.",1375574400,,6084,4.731870229007634

4820362,1,B005LAII4E,"They killed the Duke (Channing Tatum) and made The Rock the star of the movie, but he sat there like a rock. The Rock's acting is as bad as when he wrestles.  The movie is just one mess; scritp, plot, acting, music, etc..",1375488000,4,221,4.1395348837209305
4820363,3,B005LAII4E,"You should expect this to be fairly simple with a lot of action to make up for complexity of plot.  If you are ok with that, it's a great movie to watch with some fried chicken and a 2-liter of cola.",1375488000,,199,3.8536585365853657
4820364,4,B005LAII4E,"I say ""kind of"" because this movie more acknowledges the first movie than it does follow it.  It kept the main ending plot point of Zartan taking over the presidency from the first film, and expanded on the Snake Eyes/Storm Shadow story a bit, but aside from that almost everything was different.  Most of the main cast from the first movie were not brought back.  That is not such a bad thing in the case of Marlon Wayans, but it is when talking about Sienna Miller, Rachel Nichols, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Christopher Eccleston.  Although they did leave open the possibility of bringing Destro back in what will inevitably be another movie in the franchise.

The highlight of the film (as it was in the first one) were the martial arts sequences involving Ray Park and Byung Hun Lee.  Sometimes they were fighting each other, sometimes together, and sometimes on their own.  Wire work and special effects aside, they steal the show every time.  The mountain top ninja fight about halfway through the movie is worth the price.  The additions of Adrianne Palicki and D.J. Cotrona as Lady Jaye and Flint were fine, The Rock was pretty much his standard action hero persona, and Ray Stevenson as the other main bad guy Firefly was also very good.  Channing Tatum and Bruce Willis had what amounted to expanded cameo roles but were not around for long.

You pretty much know what you get going into a movie like this.  A lot of action, shoot-em-up explosions and martial arts.  The movie looks and sounds great on Blu-Ray.  The special features are pretty standard, but nothing to write home about.  Chances are if you like the first one you will like this one.  Unless of course you are one who absolutely hate the idea of the cast turn over and abandoning much of the story from the first movie.  If you hate that idea or are just not a fan of the genre in general, then skip this.  Otherwise, it is worth a couple hours of your time if you are in the mood to watch an action movie.",1375488000,2,1982,4.535211267605634

A lot of the acting as well was just a little on the bad side.  Some of that was do to what I thought was bad dialog.  I could not find any character that I could like.  Dwayne's acting really did feel like he was reading the script from paper for the first time.  Nothing flowed well for me.

Characters are week and sometimes dialogue is as cheesy as ever. Special effects are good but not great. The GI Joe movie franchise needs a very serious REBOOT or at least if a third part is coming out (which I think it will) it really needs to have a more serious tone, a better action director and a new fresh cast.

This blu-ray presentation is very strong on the AV department. The 2D video transfer really pops with solid colors and the black level and contrast are solid. I can't not say the same about the 3D presentation which is a real mess. Black levels look gray and colors look like they have been done with crayola. Some 3D scenes have a lot of crosswalk, while others really shows real sense of 3D depth.

On the audio department I have to say this is one of the best 7.1 Dolby TrueHD experience you will ever have. Paramount has done a magnificent audio transfer with rock solid LFE, dialogue is crystal clear and the surround effect are strong without overpowering the front channels.

4820456,2,B005LAII4E,"This movie falls flat in so many areas.  Except a few action sequences.  First of all, the story is boring.  Nothing new.  No twists.  No tension.  No thrills.

The acting is decent.  In fact, a budding buddy dynamic of Tatum and the Rock was mildly entertaining.  If they had been partners in a totally different flick, they might have made a cool comedic action film.  But this is supposedly G.I. Joe.

Lady Jaye is just there.  Why should we care?  we have no idea.  Flint is there.  Who is he?  Why is he a rulebreaker?  We don't know.  Roadblock is the closest in likeness to the character in comics.  Stormshadow and Snake Eyes and Jynx are cool ninjas, but why we should care about them is not touched upon.  NONE of the cool characters from the comics make appearances.  There is a horrible black rapper who plays a blind ninja master in Asia, yet he speaks like he just stumbled off the bus from Compton.  The movie kills off a bunch of anonymous Joes.  Who cares?  It is supposed to be an emotional inciting incident.  Nope, it's not.

The great Bruce Willis plays an old Joe with an arsenal in his house.  Pretty stupid.  No reason to care.  No explanation for why he has an ammo dump in his house.  No explanation for why he is so special.  In fact, he is basically another anonymous Joe running around.  The flick features Cobra Commander walking around, doing nothing.  Zartan never uses his powers other than to stay as the old tottering President.  None of the characters are developed or special.  Roadblock has kids and loves them.  Whoop dee doo.  Duke is in command of the Joes, yet he is like 13 years old, immature, has less experience than most of the other Joes, and is a dork.  Nothing like the comics.  Even the cartoons had better character development and plotlines.

If you would like a bland action movie with no blood even when someone is impaled, go for it.  This is NOT G.I.Joe in any other way than in name.  It does NO justice to the comics or cartoon.

It is sad to see such potential flushed down the toilet.  If you'd ever like to appreciate G.I.Joe in a serious way, go buy all the comics from the 80's, 90's, etc.  They have actual storylines, excellent action, and character development.

This movie is a simpleton's idea of story punctuated by some fun-to-watch, yet meaningless action scenes.

Yes, it is a toy doll franchise made into an action movie, but they could loosen up a little bit with the kid stuff and tighten up a bit with the story line. The plot was so cliche that it made cliches blush and the acting was abysmal. Wanna know how I really feel about it, don't cha?  I want my $3.99 back!

But it was not Amazon's fault, so I cannot request a refund. It hurts me, as a movie goer, that I can find independent films on AMAZON, especially Amazon Prime Video, that are real winners --then I watch a ""big budget"" Hollywood style movie and it puts me to sleep like warm milk on a rainy night.

I admit army uniforms in many cases are drab green, but this movie was just plain drab! I thought, wrongfully so, that the inclusion of Bruce Willis would up the standards for this franchise. Nope. Silly is as silly does.

I originally had this sad puppy crapping out at TWO STARS, but I rethought the graphics and eye-candy, including some impressive fight sequences, but even they were marred by dark lighting, shadow shooting, and quick-cut editing.

For instance:
1. The team was an elite AMERICAN military team that was, essentially, using standard military equipment.
2. the uniforms and costumes are a vast emprovement.
3. those idiotic ""accelerator suits"" were nowhere to be seen

I think what bothered me was that the actors did not sell the story. For instance, in the first, despite the liberties, I could except that Duke was Duke, Scarlett was Scarlett, the Baroness was the Baroness, etc. In this one, I didn't see ""Roadblock"", I saw Dawne the Rock Johnson. I didn't see Flint, I saw some expendable background character.

Snake-eyes at least had a better uniform that lacked the lips of the first movie. Even so, Ray Park did a better job channeling Snake-Eye's character in the first, despite the ridiculous costume.

And Blind Master was just awful. He did not mesh well into the film at all. They should have had Snake-Eyes and Jinx going after Stormshadow on their own initiative, and not had their old ninja clan involved at all.

Still, not a total waste and I would not mind a third, as long as they take the good from both (characters that can sell the story from the first, and the more realistic costumes/equipment from the second).",1375315200,3,1388,4.630081300813008

I like Dwayne Johnson, but he just doesn't belong in every movie.  The omission of Dennis Quaid as Gen Hawk and also the omission of Marlon Wayans and the rest of the original Joes left this episode wanting from the very beginning.

A Cobra rod dropped from a massive satellite on any major city would be devastating.

Something akin to the size of a refrigerator  or a garage would completely level Times Square killing tens of thousands. Any company can launch anything they want in America.

The 3D was impressive considering it was not shot in true 3D. Many things in this action flick are credible. Some of G.I. Joe
is comic book stuff. Shake well and you have an entertaining action packed flick. Alack, another traditional ending. American film makers have to know you can not foil the enemy every time. The rods should have made landfall at least once.

No character development or poor development that is off based from the comics which this is supposed to originate from,  the plot is a bit all over and Cobra seems to be weak as fruit punch.

Unfortunately I had high expectations for both the GI Joe movies and have been disappointed both times as far as a movie that accurately brings the comics to life without being too cheesy or too flat and one dimensional.

4820695,2,B005LAII4E,"The movies starts of very well, establishing Roadblock and Duke's relationship (and Mouse) but as the other characters are introduced the feeling of chemistry isn't there - either the actors don't like each other or aren't provided motivation as to why their characters interact the way they do.

For instance Lady Jane and Flint are supposed to have chemistry but that never materializes. Roadblock, Flint, and Lady Jane are supposed to have chemistry but that doesn't materialize and their interactions feel like a bad first date - there is a lot of mechanical talk, but no zing.

That being said the non-action moments were kind of a pain to watch, but the action scenes didn't help either. Like the chemistry with the actors, the action scenes started feeling really B movie quality. Whether it was the lighting or post production or maybe even the camera angles or a combination of all mentioned the tank fight scene looked like a speed boat chase at the water park. The entire final fight scene looked like something out of a Buffy the Vampire slayer made for TV movie.

The upside of the movie there were some good action scenes (the fight at the monestary and the attack on the underground prison), and some moments of good writing (the initial 5-25 minutes, the Fort Summter nuke disarmament talks, and the banter between Zartan and the President).

In the end, the movie is kind of like this review disorganized with a few things that will be liked, but all in all probably not straight forward enough to be useful.",1375228800,,1525,4.765151515151516
4820696,3,B005LAII4E,"What can I say about this movie. It is what it is; a G.I.Joe movie. Honestly, do we really expect epic greatness from a franchise based on a cartoon and toys? Really? Some products just are what they are. And if you've grown up on this like I did, and are honest, look back at the classic cartoon now. Like many childhood favorites, even those weren't stellar stories. But they were fun and silly entertainment. In fact, action cartoons didn't really get more ""mature"", if you will, until Batman and X-Men. I digress, this movie is based off of that, and primarily aspires to be that. You have tons of action, which I could tell they tried to take more seriously this time than the first while at the same time trying to maintain the fun of it for we who remember our childhood adventures. They also threw in cheesy, hip dialogue to look and sound cool. It of course doesn't always work, but look what you're working with. You'll either like it or hate it. I didn't expect anything monumental or groundbreaking. With that, it was basically entertaining but you won't remember it for any special reason. It's a living cartoon action movie. Isn't that all you should expect from G.I.Joe? I wish they wouldn't have killed off Duke though. Just saying. The acting was serviceable at best. Didn't seem anyone felt the need to really go all out here. The action was average mostly. Basically you've seen it before hundreds and thousands of times, save for a few clever pieces. All in all a basic movie made for fun. Anyone who dislikes this, I can't argue them. It's a take it or leave it proposition. I'm glad I at least viewed it once.

For starters, the film is just more of a professional product. The rampant use of CGI was tossed, and as a result the action scenes have been vastly improved. Marlon Wayans is also gone, which is a huge plus for the tone of the film. It's just a far better movie than the first one. It definitely is worthy of the title GI Joe. I realize that because of bad critic reviews and wannabe film critics, a lot of people won't give this a chance. Just watch it and trust me, it was very good.

4820833,1,B005LAII4E,"This movie was doomed from the start. They managed to get one main actor back (Channing Tatum as Duke) for this film and then made the movie about a different batch of characters. Spoiler alert: they kill Duke in the first act of the film. They do it for no reason. The movie was not better served, the plot wasn't advanced in any way. If anything it left a hole in the cast where the 3 remaining Joe's need to then get help later on. The actors all did their job the problem was the story, there wasn't much of one. It tied together the few loose ends from the first film and left an opening for a 3rd film if the studio wanted to throw some more money away. Or maybe they could use that money a little wiser and have a better script before they started shooting.
If you decide ""Hey I'll check it out, its an action movie, how bad can it be."" Its bad. This was my thought, ""It's G.I. Joe, how do you screw it up."" Well it was screwed up. Unless you are a huge fan of Dwayne Johnson wait for it to hit the movie channels.",1375142400,,1021,4.0344827586206895
4820834,3,B005LAII4E,"For GI JOE fans: **
The people giving low star reviews are probably fans of the cartoon who are picky about how things should of been. From a fan's point of view I can see how this movie may be a disappointment for them. It takes a very talented and unique director with an awesome imagination to recreate a story while still staying within the boundaries of seeming believable. I don't think this movie did those action figures or cartoons any justice but it is definitely worth a rent.

If not a Fan: ***
From a person who is not a fan, who could care less about how this movie compares to anything GI Joe related may appreciate it a bit more. That is if we consider you enjoy a typical action movie like Expendables 2 with cheesy one-liners and explosions. If you enjoy action movies that have to be a bit more believable or movies outside this genre. Then look elsewhere.

Better than the first but still needs work:
The first movie was terrible because 1. Just about every character looked ridiculous. 2. Had unbearably poor acting. 3. The story and direction was unbelievable or uninteresting.
In this movie they must have listened to someone's criticism because they reworked those flaws and tried. I can tell they fixed a lot of it but couldn't resist keeping something from those three flaws. So it is not perfect but at least it was better. I saw it in theaters and enjoyed it so I will probably rent it one more time. I don't think it is worth owning because it may be added to netflix soon along with the other B movies. Save your hard earned money wait to rent first.

Overall: Gook or Okay, I recommend, but a rental only.",1375142400,,1636,4.446666666666666
4820835,4,B005LAII4E,"I am at a loss to understand what people dislike about this movie. For JOE fans, its a very realistic and believable portrayal of an iconic franchise. And for the general movie goer, its an awesome action film with a great story and great characters. My one compliant is Duke's apparent death. He is my favourite character and I was hoping that these rumours about him dying were mis-information.

However I do hope that he is brought back in some manner. Duke is one of the core elements that make GI Joe what it is and as the blowback with the recurring deaths of Optimus Prime from the Transformers franchise show, you cannot just ditch one of the best characters. And I like the fact that like Duke, Channing Tatum himself as a genuinely good person as well (Its very rare in his profession and its a reason why he's one of my favourite actors). Its this quality that was also a reason why I really enjoyed seeing Dwayne Johnson as Roadblock and Bruce Willis as General Joseph Colton. Jonathan Pryce is equally excellent as a villian and as a good guy and the portrayals of Lady Jaye, Flint, Jinx, Snake-Eyes and Storm Shadow were pitch-perfect. The story itself is really well written and, as previously mentioned, a very realistic take on the franchise.

This is a much better movie than other reviewers say and - provided that Duke is brought back and Channing Tatum plays him again - I'm looking forward to the next film in the series. Hopefully we'll also the return of the Baroness and that Joseph Gordan-Levitt will come back as Cobra Commander.",1375056000,,1556,4.613718411552346

To me the first one just had no real excitement and was kind of boring. I will admit that this one was way better then the first one and actually kept me watching all the way to the end. The dialog is almost as bad as Batman & Robin's but in a movie like this all you really care about is what blows up. Which brings me to my final problem with movies like this. They don't show blood or any real violence in order to keep the PG-13 rating. A lot o parents still think it's too violent for their kids and don't let them watch movies like this. On the other hand since it' not violent enough for an R most parents don't watch either. That leaves this movie in a no-man's land. Overall, much better then the first one, but that's about it.

4821024,1,B005LAII4E,"I was mildly excited for this movie - and boy was I not happy with the outcome.  The first G.I. Joe movie, The Rise of Cobra, came out of nowhere to become one of my favorite 'corny action thrillers'.  It had everything: Dennis Quaid, Channing Tatum in a love story/hero to be role, Channing Tatum's always corny side-kick, awesome training montage, high-tech weapons (nano nukes!!), a full back story of Snake Eyes and every imaginable fighting sequence.  The Rise of Cobra really did surprise me in its thoroughness and quality.

Since my excitement going into the first movie was low and I came out wildly impressed, I decided to keep the same level of optimism for Retaliation.  This movie was awful.  First off, Channing Tatum dies within the first 20 minutes.  The only semblance of dialogue and actor chemistry in the movie came in the form of Tatum and The Rock.  Instead of letting this develop...they apparently didn't have the budget to allow it since it was spent on terrible CGI...Tatum gets killed and the main character role is left to The Rock - and unlike his muscles his acting was soft and weak.  Let's also not forget how they completely forgot to discuss the transition of the team used in Rise of Cobra and in Retaliation.  Jamie Foxx's look-alike is no where to be seen, nor is he even mentioned.  Heavy Duty is gone.  Scarlett is gone.  The lack of ANY transitioning was pathetic.

I realize this is a different producer from the first...but they could have at least acknowledged the previous film and its characters.  After Tatum dies, the movie continues its epic free-fall into mediocrity and beyond.  The supporting cast is weak and no character development occurs.  Flint?  I bet you don't even know who that is (he's apparently a Joe, although I didn't see a single unique or special quality throughout the film. Perhaps he was there to help make Dwayne look better in his XS-Under Armour skin tight tee?).  As sad as I am to say it, Bruce Willis didn't even show up for this movie.  He just collected a pay check, read his 20-some odd lines and did some super slow-mo action shots that the viewer can tell isn't really that dangerous.  To top it off, Snake Eyes apparently got an apprentice?  No development here, again, and then a stunning lack of clarity on the characters purpose save for her looks.  The only 'touching' part of the movie, in my mind, was when Snake Eyes has to fight alongside his life-long enemy, Storm Shadow (who apparently didn't kill their master all those years ago, thus making Snakes Eyes look like a fool for his life a silence - again, really?).  But that wasn't enough to make the forced storyline seem natural or likeable.

This review could go on an on about the movies pit-falls - but I'll keep it to three paragraphs.  Case end point: Do no watch this film.  Do not purchase this film.  Pray if there is a third installment it is produced by someone else and the original GI Joe flame manages to find its way back onto the screen.",1374624000,,2997,4.614366729678639

4821050,4,B005LAII4E,"The first GI Joe film, ""Rise of Cobra,"" punched so many holes in the Joe mythos that Jon Chu's ""Retaliation"" found itself in the position of having to fix its own canon. Unfortunately, removing GI Joe from its '80s context--and thus losing the Vietnam War as an underpinning of the characters' psychology--means that a modern Joe film will never be perfect no matter how much spackling you do, but in my opinion, ""Retaliation"" still manages to pull out some charm. In fact it's a loud, fun, slightly brainless action movie, and that's never unwelcome.

Ultimately, the film does feel sort of semidigested: large chunks of exposition are randomly shoved into the plot, and a couple of characters are almost totally extraneous. You can definitely see that it went through a LOT of editing, too--some sequences, such as the transition from the surviving Joes in the desert to Snake-Eyes with Jinx and the Blind Master in Japan, are embarrassingly clunky. (The Blind Master should also be called the Exposition Master. Writing team Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick give us some good one-liners, but they don't seem sure of how to convey a plot centered on a mute character.) But ""Retaliation"" wins back some points by reversing several of the blunders of the first film--eighty-sixing Cobra Commander's bizarre monster mask, giving Storm Shadow back some moral ambiguity, and letting the Joes rely on good old-fashioned guns instead of the totally uncharacteristic and, quite frankly, silly accelerator suits. It still feels cartoonish, but not in a bad way.

The newcomers to the film franchise also have a good amount of life to them. Special mention has to go to Ray Stevenson, who's clearing having a ball hamming it up as the murderous Firefly. Jonathan Pryce, as our Zartan-disguised-as-the-US-President, takes great big joyous bites out of the scenery as he threatens an assembly of world leaders.

This is not a serious film. But it's silly, goofy, loud and over-the-top in all the right places, and gets more things right than wrong. I'll take it.",1374537600,,2048,5.017647058823529

4821138,2,B005LAII4E,"(There are some slight spoilers ahead. Sorry) The first movie (G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra) was better. Here's the long and the short of it. The first movie had it's glaring flaws without a doubt. The least of them was giving Snake Eyes a mouth on his mask. Perhaps the worst thing about the first movie - the needless intertwining plots for the sake of character development that turned Duke and the Baroness into exes and Cobra commander into the Baroness's little brother. Needless. But where they got it right - this movie failed miserably. G.I.Joe: Retaliation completely abandoned character development putting implied stereotype into full effect instead. They gave the viewer absolutely no reason to care about the characters aside from ennobled revenge for their fallen friends. Bruce Willis' character was a cool idea that had no point other than to attempt to fix plot holes in the story. His meaning and significance to the story was vacant. The writing was so thin I dare say they didn't even give Dwayne Johnson a fair chance to show how well he can act. I think Flint was in this movie (that was sarcasm). He was the overly athletic and impulsive white guy with three lines in the movie. The most significant divide between the two movies - Rise of the Cobra felt like G.I.Joe. Regardless of getting origins wrong and mostly cheesy dialogue, one has to excuse some of these flaws for the correct interpretation of ""fighting over land and sea and air"" that exemplifies G.I.Joe. G.I.Joe is ""Go big or go home"". Retaliation is brand void. It actually feels like that's how they intended it. The mantra most have been ""if the viewer can't characterize it, then they can't blame us for getting it wrong."" The Joes felt small in this movie. Not at all like the large team of highly trained and funded military that was the crux of the cartoon series. Incidentally, the one thing they got right this time was Snake Eyes' mask.

The first one, although unbelievable, and a little formulaic, contained a good dose of humour to carry you through and connect with the characters. At the end of the first one I was curious enough to see what was next in store for rip, scarlett, duke, anna and the rest. I now know, Nowt. Nada, Zip. Pretty much all the characters you were invested in from the first one are not in the second one.

The second one was a real step down, both in characters and plot. Many of the Rock's other movies at least fit his personality, this one having laid the stage with humour and Duke, means the rock is playing second fiddle to this.

At this point I have little curiosity in whatever the next installment would be, there are no characters to have curiosity about, there was no development of them, no humour. Lets face it, guns bombs and more guns are plentiful in movies these day, they have to up the realism because people are so numb to it.

There are movies that ask you to shut your mind off and just go with the idiocy going on on screen. And then there is GI Joe. Nothing makes sense in this film. Not a single solitary thing. There's really nothing more I can say about it. It isn't suspension of belief that this movie asks of you, but the utter ejection of your brain into a little jar which you might hopefully get back when you walk away. I'm sorry, I couldn't do it. I just couldn't do it. Once, a long time ago, I could. I still remember being very entertained by the first Transformers, so obviously suspension of belief to this level was possible for me at some time in my life, but I just can't do it anymore.

The movie starts with a GI Joe par core fight scene, which I guess was supposed to be exiting but all I could thing about was The Office.

[...]

It really is that ridiculous. But to be fair, this is standard popcorn action stuff. I can forgive a movie its sins of over the top action, I have in the past, I will probably do it in the future. But the action in this movie never really excited me at any point. I can enjoy dumb action as much as the next guy (hell, I think I'm the only one in the world who liked Die Hard 4 after all), but GI Joe's was just too... Transformy. And not in the Transformer 1 kinda way, more like in the ""what in the name of God is going on here?"" Transformer's two kinda way. A small difference, I know, but even those who enjoy the first Transformers as a guilty pleasure want to rip our heads off at the idiocy that is the second movie. Transformers 1=stupid fun, while Transformers 2="" my God what did I just see?"" That's pretty much how I felt at the end of this film. A lot of bullets are thrown around, a lot of explosions, and a lot of crazy over the top action slock. But just about everything in it defines all sense of logic and reason to the point where I think the movie was written by the special effects people instead of, well, you know, actual writers. Did Michael Bay do this movie? No? Well riddle me surprised.

But it's not the crazy over the top action that does this movie in. Despite my bad mouthing it, there were a couple of scenes I have to admit were really freaking cool. No siry, it's the complete lack of sense. Spoilers follow, so if you care about such things, cover your virgin eyes. So Cobra's plan to take over the world is, upon installing one of his henchmen as the fake President, to assassinate the Joe's with a massive military strike against their base after framing them for the assassination of the Pakistani President after using them to steal all of Pakistan's nukes which are conveniently all located in one central location guarded by people wearing towels (and no, that's not a racist remark, one of the dudes is literally wearing a towel on his head). So they launch a massive strike against the Joes... and no one ever questions the logic behind this, asks why the attempt was never made to capture and try them, question the President's authority to straight up kill all the Joe's using (ahem) COBRA troops. Did none of the generals wonder who all those mysterious troops were? So once the Joe's are out of the way the next step in the plan is to gather together in one spot the leaders of every nuclear armed nation in the world in order to negotiate talks on nuclear disbarment. Once there he, launches his nukes at all of them? Okay, first off, North Korea is at these talks. What fantasy world is this? North Korea sitting down at the negotiating table to talk about nuclear disbarment? Balderdash! So the nations of the world respond by, launching every single nuke they have, AT EACH OTHER? Wait a minute, they weren't nuking each other, America was nuking them, why then would they nuke each other in response? So the fake President then destroys all his nukes with a magical button, an watches as all the other world leaders have similar magical buttons that destroy their nukes midair as well. But wait, what if one of them decided not to? What if, you know, North Korea or Iran decided, screw it, and let their missiles destroy America anyway? Then Cobra would be dead, and the whole plan would be for nothing. Yeah, way to go Cobra.

END SPOILERS!
You see, no logic. There are so many plot holes in this movie it might as well be Swiss cheese. Nothing in this movie makes sense. There's a part where a character takes out a handful of grenades he was hiding in a fruit bowl, a FRUIT BOWL. Golly, sure hope he doesn't have any company over for dinner. Wouldn't want any kid finding a freaking grenade while looking for a banana. I haven't mentioned a quarter of the huge gaping holes in this movie, and I think just the ones I listed are pretty bad.

The acting is adequate for this kind of movie though nothing special. The Rock puts in a fun performance, while everyone else is... well, there. Bruce Willis was an odd character. He didn't really do much, just sort of gave the Joe's their guns for the final battle and helped out a little bit in that battle, but he is more of an extended cameo then an actual character. I mean it's still Bruce Willis, so you know he's a cool guy,  but it seemed like a role they threw in there to give the movie a little extra star power it didn't have before.

So in conclusion, GI Joe is Transformers 2. Is it better than the first? I don't know, as I've never seen the first. Is it entertaining in its own right? That all depends on the level of BS you can take before giving up on a movie. I was somewhat with this movie all the way up to the point where the villains revealed their master plan, at that point I couldn't take it anymore. It had reached levels of ridiculousness m fragile little mind could not take. I would recommend this movie to those who enjoyed all three Transformers movies, know they are capable of suspending belief in the rules of logic and reason for an entire movie, and want nothing more than to see big huge action scenes. If that's you, you'll like this movie, and more power to you. If not, I'd recommend saving your money.

4821231,5,B005LAII4E,"This 3D review is intended for those with 3DTVs and/or fans of 3D.

GI Joe Retaliation was originally meant to be released during summer 2012, but was delayed till March 29, 2013 to be converted into 3D. So did they have enough time to make the 3D worth our time and frustration (of GI Joe fans) having to wait even longer to see the movie in theaters?

Absolutely. The 3D is very powerfully rendered in GI Joe Retaliation. This is not a half baked 3D effort as many of the earlier, hurried 3D conversions of films like Clash of the Titans' poor 3D. The 3D here offers unexpectedly outstanding dimension and depth in many of the cool action scenes, coupled with a generous amount of pop outs. It's been said the Snake Eyes scene was noteworthy (with Snake Eyes portrayed on the Blu Ray 3D cover), and indeed it is as the 3D gives that scene depth the likes of which are rarely seen in conversions. Thankfully the rest of the movie holds up well in 3D.

3D Overall: 9/10
3D Dimension: 9/10
3D Pop Out: 8/10
3D Depth: 9/10",1372291200,69,1020,4.3578947368421055

If this sounds like fun, it is, sort of. The highlight of the film other than the 3D effect, which enhances the visuals, is the terrific chemistry of its stars, which prevents it from being a very ordinary action film. The Rock is good in everything he does, and Bruce Willis provides a bit of humor to the film. Not too much different from other explosion-filled action movies you've seen, a good bit of casting helps this one",1370822400,2,597,4.486238532110092
4821233,3,B005LAII4E,"If you remember what happened to the US president played by Jonathan Pryce in ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" (2009), you know the sequel is inevitable. Despite its disappointingly low ""positive"" score on Rotten Tomatoes (28 percent), I didn't find ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"" to be as horrible as professional critics would lead you to believe. At least, I was not bored.

That is not to say that ""Retaliation"" is an action movie masterpiece. The story unfolds in a not very compelling way. Cobra strikes back, framing the G.I. Joe team for assassinating the Pakistani president. Then the surviving warriors - Flint (D.J. Cotrona), Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) and Duke (Channing Tatum) - fight back, with a help from General Joseph Colton (Bruce Willis). Interestingly, the film's rather formulaic script is penned by the team Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, writers of ""Zombieland.""

So where are Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee)? They appear but perhaps not in the way you expect. Martial art action scenes are at best average, though the cliff-hanging ninja sword fight sequences in the Himalayas are impressive.

In short ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"" is mindless fun, with several nice action scenes.",1370736000,3,1243,5.174129353233831
4821234,3,B005LAII4E,"This is supposed to be an all-out action entertainer. A sequel to the first G.I.Joe movie which was awful, boring, senseless and disappointing. This Retaliation is barely watchable.

The only reason anyone would watch this movie is because it stars Dwayne The Rock Johnson. That is the only reason I watched it from start to end. The Rock's screen presence is incredible. He puts up the show and everything else bad about the movie doesn't matter.

Bruce Willis is in a cameo as the first G.I.Joe. It is completely unmemorable role with zero witty lines.

Everyone else is forgettable. No personality, no character, no fun.

The explosions are all nice. The big guns are great. But it fails as an action movie.

More importantly it fails to match the military movie standards set by franchises such as Bourne Identity and James Bond. Even the 60s and 70s Bond movies are better written and made than this G.I.Joe movie.

Rock should of not been the main person and he was.,1369872000,2,361,3.525
4821274,4,B005LAII4E,"Coming from a long time fan who grew up watching the original GI Joe cartoon, GI Joe Retaliation is definitely better than Rise of Cobra.

PROS:  It's a lot more authentic in weaponry and costumes.  Cobra Commander actually looks like Cobra Commander.  Snake Eyes lost that mouth he had in Rise of Cobra that made him look like a Power Ranger.  The Joe cast overall is better and a lot more believable as a top special forces unit.  Gone is the over-the-top high tech gadgetry from Rise of Cobra, replaced with more recognizable gear from the cartoon.  The action as a result is a lot better and overall just a lot more well done.  Bruce Willis and the Rock add some needed star power and some good laughs as well.

CON:  The one big beef with Retaliation is the handling of the plot.  I won't spoil it, but fact is, they goofed it a bit.  They were going for dark, but the timing and method were just off leaving more of a ""this movie is now missing something"" feel vs an authentic dark and dangerous mood.  If you've read any of the other reviews or read about the reasons this was delayed a year (involving their handling of a certain star's character in the film), then you know what I'm talking about.  Had this not been the case, Retaliation might have at least been in the conversation for best action film of the year.  Instead, it will be considered good, but not great.

Personally, I only dock it one star for the CON.  GI Joe is something you go see for good action and a lot of it.  In that, Retaliation does not disappoint and is better than Rise of Cobra.",1369612800,4,1570,4.3367697594501715

4821277,5,B005LAII4E,"I really don't understand where a lot of these reviews are coming from. Bruce Willis is a bad actor? Um...ok.

SPOILER!!!!
Yes, Duke dies, Channing Tatum's character. A lot of people complained about this. ""Duke Never Died!"" Actually, he pretty much did in the original G.I. Joe cartoon film, and did die in it's original version. Still, he is the one character (aside from Cobra Commander) that was any good from the first G.I. Joe live action film ""Rise Of Cobra,"" which really was just ok.

The opening consists of introducing a few new characters while the situation with Zartan posed as the president commands a Cobra strike on the Joe's, in which most of them are killed. This is a pretty hard hit to start out a film with, but we see Cobra doing it's worst damage imaginable in this film, what they were afraid to ever do in the cartoons (for obvious reasons). This G.I. Joe movie is far more gritty than the previous one, which is by all means, a very good thing.

We end up with Cobra Commander (the new actor is great) and others getting back together while Roadblock (The Rock) and Lady Jaye go and find ""Joe Colton"" who was the original Joe. Great!!! What ensues are various ways to question if the president is the president, and it leads to them confirming it.

The president (as Zartan) literally begins a nuclear war, threatening everyone and then stopping his own while others do. He shows them a device that is like a nuclear bomb without fallout, and there are many in space. These satellites of destruction destroy London, and the vision of it is pretty creepy. A terrorist organization that actually suceeds? As Zartan says in the trailer ""This is what we have been waiting for."" No more cheesiness with nanobots or plots that never happen.

Now, after this, we do get some serious plotline with Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes, that Storm Shadow was after Zartan for killing their ""master"", and was only working the other side to get close to them. People didn't like this plot point, missing that this is the same plot the character had in the cartoons and original comics. With them, you get the film's greatest fight scene, in which they fight a lot of ninja's up on mountains.
The 3D here was truly impressive, and I am self-spoken hater of cheap 3-D conversions. This isn't one of them.

So when the team is together, you can expect a lot of explosive fights with geniune G.I. Joe vechicles (which people complain is to sell more toys) that were lacking horribly from the first film. In the end, well, most turns out good, but there is a pretty nice opening left, even when a lot is closed up.

I won't spoil further. This is 100x better than ""Rise Of Cobra,"" and a lot of the reviews are complaining about things they are wrong about, or are die-hard Channing Tatum fans (who, despite him being a good fit for the role of Duke, is not all G.I. Joe is about). If you do not want to watch a well-done G.I. Joe film-a good plot, lots of cool characters, a lot of fights and explosions-good guys mostly save the day, then stay away. Otherwise, jump on, because this film is about as good as one could make a G.I. Joe film.

I hope the same people stay on to do a third, actors and directors, etc. They left it open for a pretty good chance for something as good-and dare I say after my prior words-better? Time will tell, this film was far more sucessful than the first.",1368921600,12,3390,4.482982171799027

""Firefly"" is portrayed accurately,.... things they got wrong....killing off Duke (was pushed back 9 months so Tatum could get more screen time, what screen time???)...never happened in the comics, ""Cobra Commander"" & ""Storm Shadow"" leaving ""Destro"" to die,(what??)....no explanation as to what happened to ""Baroness, Scarlett, Breaker, Ripcord, & Hawk"" from the first film, Paramount was too cheap to bring back Sienna Miller, Rachel Nichols, Marlon Wayans, & Dennis Quaid, but not explaining their fates was even cheaper!!, a line of dialogue would have been nice, but noooooo!!!...we are left to wonder, Sienna Miller in 2009 said she was paid to appear in three ""G.I.Joe"" films as Baroness, I guess she got a free paycheck for not appearing here, this is what happens when you put idiots in charge of a franchise like this, there are however some high points to this one that I will point out, Adrianne Palecki as ""Lady J"", simply beautiful, so much so that I am willing to forgive Paramount for depriving me of Rachel Nichols as Scarlett, the mountain top fight sequence involving Snake Eyes & Jinx  vs  Storm Shadow's guards has to be seen to be believed, a simply breath taking action sequence, the action set pieces are more this time around, the world leader's summitt meeting is to close to a terrifying reality when the president (Zartan) launches all of the U.S. nukes, forcing the other world leaders to do the same, all in an attempt to disarm the world & take control, all orchestrated by Cobra Commander, this kind of thing was always hinted at in the comics & cartoon, Bruce Willis appearing as the original Joe from the 60's toy line was fun, talk about a guy packing heat, the hiding places in his home is a home invader's worst nightmare, & Willis hams it up no doubt, all in all this one is more of the same, like the first film it is hit & miss, as I stated in my review of that one, you shouldn't go in with high expectations, or expecting Paramount to have learned anything from the first film's mixed reaction, but if you want some cool action/fight scenes, then this is your film, & Adrianne Palecki will definately keep you watching no matter what.",1367539200,29,2879,4.767535070140281

4821333,3,B005LAII4E,"I really enjoyed GI Joe Rise of Cobra. It was not perfect but it was a good movie. In an age where cinema gives the audience reboots, sequels, prequels, and adaptations, here are my thoughts on GI Joe Retaliation.

Returning to the movie: Channing Tatum as Duke, Ray Park as Snake Eyes, Byung-hun Lee as Storm Shadow(good performance), Jonathan Pryce as the President, and taking the role as primary villain this time around; Arnold Vosloo as Zartan. New additions include: Dwayne Johnson as Roadblock, RZA as Blind Master, D J Cotrona as Flint, Bruce Willis as Joseph Colton, and the beautiful Adrienne Palicki as Lady Jaye(yes she IS hot). The acting was not the best all the way through, but I do not always expect ""the greatest acting ever"" with a movie like this.

The story line is actually quite fun, and there will be some surprises thrown your way while watching this movie. Occasionally, there are times when the script goes all over the place and it does have a few cheesy one liners, but it does have its undeniably funny moments including (spoiler) watching Channing Tatum play video games. The story may not be the best, but Retaliation does deliver the goods in terms of action, sound, and its core plan as a movie.

As stated in my headline, I feel Retaliation is not entirely better than its predecessor, but it is a good feeling when despite the flaws, and major/minor differences, you still find yourself enjoying a movie for what it is. GI Joe Retaliation is likable as a sequel, and while i do feel improvements can/should be made, I see no problem with a 3rd movie being made. As a matter of fact, I welcome it.

Loosely based on the characters in the animated series, the latest installment is about the ""busiest"" movie I've ever seen--and delivers almost no entertainment and manages to make lititle or no sense.  The plot is all over the place, it has way too many sub-plots (none of which I cared one iota about), and is just a scripted, by-the-book example of what passes for ""action"" in the 'Hills these days.

Directed by Jon Chu and starring Channing Tatum, Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson, and Bruce Willis, GIJ gave us a lot of characters NOT to care about.  Both Tatum and Willis had to have made a ton of bucks just to have their names associated with this debacle.  Tatum's character is killed pretty early in the movie and Bruce Willis still has that ""Bruce Willis Acting"" down--running the gauntlet from A to B.  He always looks like someone is holding a small t*rd under his nose and he seems to be totally disinterested in this movie.

My dad and I were both interested in seeing this movie because we enjoyed the first one, so I decided I would treat him to a viewing for his birthday.  We both really enjoyed the movie, it was action packed and a lot of fun! I enjoyed the movie overall, but my favorite of it was seeing what developed with Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow.  I don't want to say too much on that account, just watch the movie for yourself.

The actors all did a good job in the film, and it was a joy to see Dwayne Johnson as Roadblock and Bruce Willis as General Colton.  I was glad to see Flint and Lady J in the film too, as I'd wondered why they were not included in the first film, though regardless, I did really enjoy the first film.  And as always, a joy to have Ray Park back as Snake Eyes and Lee Byung-hun as Storm Shadow.

Now for the aspects of the film that I did not really care for, mainly involving the characters, or lack there of.  *SPOILER ALERTS* Firstly, although I know the director had or might have a purpose for it, I didn't like that they killed of Duke, especially considering he was a primary character in the cartoon series...just didn't sit well with me.  Secondly and primarily, what the heck happened to some of the characters from the first film?  I.e. Ripcord, Baroness, etc.  They all seemed fine and dandy at the end of the first movie?  Why did they just suddenly drop out of the picture, without us knowing what became of them?  I imagine that some of it had to do with the fact that they couldn't get some of the actors back to play the rolls again, but c'mon...give us something!  It was kind of annoying to me that they suddenly weren't involved in the 2nd movie, without even so much as an explaination on what become of them.  I don't know, maybe they'll make a return in the 3rd film, because you know they'll make a 3rd one, and then maybe we'll get some answers.  Growing up loving GI Joe and being a bit of a fan, this just kind of bugs me.

All that aside though, with that exception, the movie is awesome and action packed and should suffice most action movie fanatics, whether you grew up with GI Joe or just a big time action movie fan, which I am both.  Check it out, but decide for yourselves whether to pay to see it while it's still in the theater, or to buy it or just rent it down the road.",1365724800,4,2369,4.2150776053215075

I don't want to say much about what happened in the movie, since a couple of reviews I read before seeing it spoiled a point or two for me but I will say it renewed my faith in Hollywood's ability to use at least SOME of the original plot points and character histories.

I'll admit, I went to the first one to see just how bad they screwed up my all-time favorite (comic book) military unit only to discover myself hooked on the movie.

I went to the sequel to see if all the bad reviews I'd read on Yahoo! movies page were right.

THEY WEREN'T!!

This is an action movie worthy of viewing even if you're not a Joe fan.  If you are, then definitely get it and be prepared to see more of the comic book storylines for the characters.

I was in the Army and saw alot of special forces guys and though they may be wearing the same uniform, they looked different because some may wear hats, scarfs, glasses, or what have you. They tried to deliver a unique version of Joe and in my opinion they moved so far away from canon they should not make a sequal, wait five years and reboot this whole thing. And please, do not hire a director that has only made dance movies. Common sense would have lifted this movie up.",1365552000,6,1337,4.309523809523809

I just went to see Retaliation in the theaters and what a disappointment.  While the action scenes are great, the storyline is terrible.  I think Hasbro did a disservice to the franchise by letting these movies get produced.",1365292800,15,387,4.347222222222222

4821370,3,B005LAII4E,"I have to confess, I really, really liked the first film.  You decide if you want to keep reading after I give my reasons for it.  Most people tend to dislike G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra because it's not a faithful adaptation of the cartoon.  For that same reason many people dislike Dolph Lungdren's vehicle Masters of the Universe and Michael Bay's Transformers.  And it's a WRONG reason.  Why?  Well, because neither of those movies are actually based on a cartoon.  The licenses the filmmakers got to make those movies were from the toy lines.  The cartoons are adaptations of the toys and the movies are adaptations of the toys, but the movies are not adaptations of the cartoons.  That's why you can't expect them to be similar.  It'd be like complaining that Batman Begins is a poor adaptation of Bruce Timm's Batman Animated Series.  It's not, they're both different adaptations of the same source material.

That being said, I think filmmakers could do a better job if they took a glance at what worked in the most successful adaptations of the source material and apply it to their own adaptations (riding the last example, I think it's pretty obvious Nolan took a good glance at the Batman Animated Series when he prepared to make his Batman film, just like that series clearly was influenced by Tim Burton's films).

In any case, I really have no memories of the cartoon.  I sort of remember it watching it but pretty much nothing about it but the name.  The reason for it is probably that unlike for other cartoons like, say, He-Man, Duck Tales or Super Friends, I never got a chance to watch G.I. Joe reruns when I got older, so it's a forgotten show for me.  That allowed me to see The Rise of Cobra with a clean mind and while its value as an adaptation escapes me, I think it's a competent and even great fun action flick.  It's no less realistic than anything Arnie has done, and it knows how to mantain a good pacing.  And while it has a lot of characters, it does a good job of giving them all good screen time and something fun to do.

Enter the sequel, G.I. Joe: Retaliation.  In case you were busy fighting cockroach men in an alternate dimension for the past year, you probably know this movie was ready to be released some eight-nine months ago and they decided to delay it to this year.  Three major reasons were given for it.  Actually, scratch that, only one major reason was given for it, the other two are either minor or speculation.  The reason they gave was that they wanted to do a 3D conversion.  The other reason that was barely mentioned was that since one of the only four actors to come back for the sequel (five if you count CGI Arnold Vosloo's half-face), Channing Tatum, had acquired some newfound fame, they wanted to film some extra scenes with him.  The speculated reason was that the studio wasn't happy with the film.

Now, it's perfectly true that they did a 3D conversion.  I can't speak for its quality, though, since I watched it in 2D.  It's also true they added a few more scenes with Tatum.  And if the third reason isn't true, then the studio didn't actually watch the film.

If you've seen the trailer, you'll notice that the basic gist of the film is that the old team (lead by Tatum's Duke) gets killed and what's left of the new guys (The Rock, Adrianne Palicki and D.J. Cotrona) need to team up with the oldest member of the team, name-giver Joe (Bruce Willis) to fight a returning Cobra Commander (not Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and save the world from his influence due to master-of-disguise Zartan posing as the president.

Speculation was that the new scenes filmed with Tatum would be to reveal Duke's survival after his on-screen death but I'm going to spoil this for you because you need to know what the filmmakers wasted nine months on:  Duke dies.  He doesn't come back, his death is barely suffered and his name is only mentioned once after the fact.  No, the added scenes with Tatum were all at the beginning of the film, in which he sucks at playing videogames, sucks at shooting and sucks at making comebacks.  And he's probably one of the actors with more screen time.

You see, this movie's choice of screen time for the characters is atrocious.  You'll go out of the movie thinking President Zartan is the protagonist, since he's the one we see the most.  Yet the rest of the characters have so little time on screen that I had to double check my watch after exiting the theater to confirm the movie hadn't last only half an hour.  I hadn't seen so many characters with so poor characterization since Mortal Kombat: Anihilation.  Hey, that's actually a great comparison.  Characters are on screen for a minute or two, do something and exit unceremoniously with little to no explanation.  Want to know how Storm Shadow survived the first film?  You're out of luck because he simply shows up and no one seems surprised.  Is Jynx a character you are interested in?  Well, too bad, because she maybe has two lines of dialogue and none of them are about her.  Are you excited for Bruce Willis showing up as a mentor figure for these guys?  Sucks to be you (and me), because he has maybe three minutes of screen time and all he does is give the Joes some weapons and shoot a couple of bullets by himself.

And once you're watching the movie, they do the same.  They set expectations that are never met.  They show Duke and Roadblock being friends and the latter seems to completely forget about the former's death minutes after the fact.  They try to picture Flint as a loose cannon at the very beginning to completely forget about his existence in the middle.  They hint at a romance between him and Lady Jaye and that never goes anywhere.  They set a moment in which Snake Eyes is about to be seen as the culprit for his master's death and that is ignored instantly.  When introducing Jynx they mention she's related to Storm Shadow yet up until the climax they act like strangers the few moments they're together.

So why three stars instead of five?  Well, to be fair, it's a visually appealing film.  The few action scenes it has are nice looking, if not as interesting as the ones in the first film.  There's a battle in the middle between Snake Eyes, Jynx and a bunch of ninjas that goes out of its way in increasingly ridiculous stunts to go for the classic ""bad guys chasing the good guys are taken out one by one by the environment"", but it's nice.  The Cobras' new superweapon packs a punch in a way that Roland Emmerich would be jealous.  Newcomer villain Firefly is interesting in a Metal-Gear-Solid-Boss sort of way but, like everyone else, he's underused.  His appereance in the film was crazily enhanced momentarily for me in a moment in which, I swear to God, a real firefly showed up in my theater.  I was ready to compliment the amazing 3D effect when I remembered I wasn't watching the film in 3D.  Jonathan Pryce is clearly having a blast playing President Zartan, and you either love him or hate him.  The Rock is still a great action star, and he does a good job with what little he has.  The new Cobra Commander looks very cool.  And Adrianne Palicki is really, REALLY hot.  She looked ridiculous in her Wonder Woman outfit, but in this film she's pure, delicious, sweet eye candy.  Heck, two stars from this review are for her presence alone.  That being said, her character has nothing to do.  There's the aforementioned forgotten romance and a half-baked backstory about her father, whose conclusion would be underwhelming if it was something that had had any sort of impact in the film.

So yeah, count me as one who enjoyed the first movie better.  If I decide to get this movie on Blu-Ray I'll update the review to include info on the disks.  That being said, the only reason I would potentially get this film is Adriane Palicki in HD.  She definitely needs more exposure.",1365206400,7,7868,4.536221590909091
4821371,1,B005LAII4E,"I can't believe I'm going to say this, but I think Stephen Sommers's G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra is better than Jon M. Chu's sequel G.I. Joe: Retaliation and I believe Sommers is a bad if not terrible director. Let's move back for a second. Over a year ago I was hopeful and near excited about the G.I. Joe sequel. Sommers wasn't coming back and Hasbro along with Skydance productions added the likes of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Bruce Willis, Ray Stevenson and Adrianne Palicki along with bringing back Ray Park and Byung-hun Lee. That along with a good trailer was I was hesitantly hopeful that G.I. Joe: Retaliation would be a step up from its average predecessor. G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra was a decent film that was major hampered by a poor script, with some bad acting mainly on the parts of Marlon Wayans and Channing Tatum. I still don't understand the appeal of Tatum. Sure he's a good looking guy, but he's an average actor at best. With him originally not really being included in the sequel along with everything else there was hope for Retaliation. That was before Hasbro, Paramount Pictures and the rest of the studios involved decided to delay the film for nearly a year. Why because they wanted to cut up their already finished film so they could add more scenes for Tatum and to make the film 3D.

All right let's get The Ugly.

Channing Tatum: I've already said I think the actor is just not very good and his scenes in the film just seemed forced and I think anyone who sees the film can tell that certain scenes were added into the film. I am almost positive the scene early in the film with Duke (Tatum) and Roadblock (The Rock) sitting on the couch playing a video game. It seems like an easy scene the producers could have added and wouldn't have taken much time.

Plot: It's not necessarily the plot that sucks it's the total overlooking consequences or continuum from the first film yet it's supposed to be a sequel. First there is Cobra Commander and Destro who were imprisoned in the Joe's main base which if I remember correctly was somewhere in the Middle East. Yet in Retaliation they're locked away in a prison in Europe, and let's talk about the prison for a second. I know with films like this you're supposed to suspend believe, but it just didn't make sense. The prison seemed small like it was only built to house those two and then there was the security. If you're housing two criminals who tried to and killed thousands of lives you'd think they'd be much more security. How did Tatum become the head of G.I. Joe and what happened to the main base. The film never mentions that or what happened to some of the characters from the previous films like Ripcord, Heavy Duty, General Hawk or Scarlet. The film didn't have to go into real detail, but at least mention where they are or what happened to them. These big flaws along with other in the writing took a lot away from the film.

Editing: The addition of scenes forced into the film was poorly done. You can tell where things were edited out or added in. It's one thing to delay a film so it can be converted to 3D it's another thing to try to force in additional scenes after a film is already done. It certainly didn't work here.

RZA: Who is RZA and what the hell was he doing in this film? That just didn't make sense and him playing Blind Master was just laughable.

Jon M. Chu: Having Chu the director of Retaliation was one of the things I didn't like. He had only directed Step Up films along with Justin Bieber: Never Say Never. He's never done a film like this before and it shows. The action scenes while decent aren't well done and not better than the original. He obviously doesn't have any ability to direct real actors or filming action scenes.

Let's move onto The Bad

Snake Eyes/Storm Shadow: In the first film these two stole the film with really good action scenes. In Retaliation the characters just seemed to have been force into the back ground and the plot with them was just badly written.

The Rock: I like Dwayne Johnson he's a decent actor who has a great personality, but here in Retaliation playing Roadblock he was an empty shell of a character with no personality. The Rocks action scenes were well done, but that was it.

Bruce Willis: The great action star would seem like a logical choice to be in a G.I. Joe film, but just like with the latest Die Hard film and The Expendables 2 it just didn't work. It just seemed like he was forced into the film and just a plot point. I have no doubt Roadblock and the rest of the Joes could have found out what Cobra was doing without General Joseph Colton's help and that includes weapons. Bruce Willis has certainly made some bad choices with his last few films.

Let's move on to The Good (Yes there were few things I liked about the film.)

Firefly: I loved the character in the comics and I thought Ray Stevenson did a good job portraying the character.

Flint: I'm sure others will disagree, but I thought the little known actor D.J. Cotrona did a good job. Though Cotrona and Flint don't have a ton of screen time or character development I did enjoy the actor and his portrayal of Flint.

Lady Jaye: Yes it's a guilty pleasure in that Adrianne Palicki is gorgeous and having her in a film just makes any film a tiny bit better, but here in Retaliation I think she did a good job. Palicki had a chance to shine as Jaye was one of the few characters to actually have personality and actual character depth. Adrianne's performance was good and along with her looks helped the film a little bit in my opinion.

Well that's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly of G.I. Joe Retaliation. Paramount delayed the film for nearly a year and what did we receive in return? We got back garbage with a poorly developed script, terrible directing, decent acting and action/effects. Overall I think it was a mistake to delay the film to force in more scenes with Tatum and convert the film to 3D. I would like to see what the original version of the film looked like. I bet it was and is better than the version the studios gave us. I highly don't recommend this film as a waste of money and time. I wish this film would bomb so the franchise could be rebooted down the road by another studio than maybe we and I could get the version of G.I. Joe that is actually good.",1365206400,26,6320,4.408233276157804
4821372,3,B005LAII4E,"I was excited last year about seeing this. I like The Rock & I love Bruce Willis but the delays and latter previews made me weary to see this film. So what made me see it? A free ticket I received from a Blu-Ray Purchase [Minority Report if you need to know]. So even after debating using the ticket I caved and went to see it. It's much in the vein of Transformers, a plot barely there but to serve for an excuse for action scenes. Now this was a mixed bag of good ideas [ex. Storm Shadow's Secret, Cobra Commander's Demeanor & Ray Stevenson's Firefly] & terrible ones [ex. Motorcycle Rockets, Firefly's Bug Bombs, DJ Cotrona's Dumb as a bag of bricks Flint]. It's a movie that begs suspension of belief and when applied it's alright and has it's moments of glory but it never ever really draws you in or amazes you. No one performance in this movie will blow you away. This is one of the movies where the villains were the more fun on screen than any of the heroes. I don't want to spoil this for you so I'll make this cryptic but the villain's assault on one facility in this film was the most fun I had watching this film.

Many of the heroes were the major buzzkill for this film for me... Especially Flint. Have you ever seen a character that you were hoping was going to get killed? Well Flint [D.J. Cotrona] was that character for me. He was useless & never seemed likeable or remotely interesting. Roadblock [Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson] & Lady Jaye [Adrianne ""Super Hot"" Palicki] were fine. Snake Eyes [Ray Park] was well Snake Eyes yet his mandatory sidekick Jinx [Elodie Yung] was forgettable. The RZA as Blind Master even draws more question marks about the casting on this film. Even Bruce Willis as Joe Colton aka The Original Joe was pretty much just Bruce Willis being Bruce Willis. When half of the heroes seem like interchangeable, dull, lifeless whiners you either kind of hope for their deaths or just brief cameos. All in all it's not a bad movie especially in comparison to The Rise of Cobra but it's nothing you'll remember fondly even after the credits roll. It's a reason to go to the theatre munch some popcorn with a loved one, a date or the kids and enjoy their company.

Joes are enemies of the world and the president is an imposter. The Joes must rekindle old alliances and friendships to save the world from the evil-doers.

The film incorporates advances in science, miniature drones, and nanotechnology to the extreme. Bruce Willis is added to the mix and James Carvel plays himself in a cameo. The most incredible scene is the mountain fighting which happens about midway. The film appears to be designed for an action game, one in which my character would die in the first 20 minutes.

Joe: Retaliation after waiting nine months due to being converted to 3D, the poor box office performance of Battleship at the box office, negative test screenings from the studio that was so bad and so they decided to add an additional scene that has (Roadblock and Duke playing Call of Duty) while pushing its release back, including showcasing Channing Tanem's Duke in the first fifteen minutes of the film involving a real key scene that end up in death due to him being a bigger star thanks to Magic Mike, 21 Jump Street and The Vow. Retaliation was originally to release on June 29, last summer but with the ideas mentioned above, Magic Mike and Ted both took its place and would had faced The Amazing Spider-Man a few days later and it would had killed the film despite they both going after the same audience, Brave from a week previously, Ted in its original July 13 release date and The Dark Knight Rises weeks later, which somehow made sense and now will end up about $400 million worldwide due to the 3D boost and the international popularity of the stars. Not bad for a film that was delayed by nine months and given mixed to negative reviews from the critics and audience members, something we don't see in a film everyday. Unlike The Wolfman which its problems began when the film was pushed away from its November 2008 release at $90 million and reshoot most of the movie while adding more money to the already $90 million and it never came out until February 2010 and became a box office disater both critical and financally and G.I. Retaliation made the better mistake by not wasting additional money reshooting the whole film again (and the 3D just payed for itself) than the Wolfman. It's a turn your brain off movie when you walk in the door and or takes you back to when G.I. Joe the cartoons were back in the 1980s!

This is much better than The Rise of Cobra, that film was a disappointment to the G.I. Joe name, we get to see Cobra Commander just like the cartoons, The Rock as Roadblock and Bruce Willis as Joe kicking butt and taking names, Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes fighting, the VFX is much better, the story and characters are campy but all in good fun, the RZA stinks as blind master and no offense should stick to music, Destro gets a sort of cameo apperance from The Rise of Cobra.

Now this is a fantasy action movie, so the story was completely implausible, and some characters were just thrown in there like they just needed a reason to sell more action figures. But I can't help but love the nostalgia of it all, as I had a good many of the original toys in the 80's. And, to my excellent surprise, it was good, and the adventure moved along well. It is very action packed with cutting-edge special effects. The movie kept my male/21st-century brain at attention. I was so engaged that I didn't even eat my overpriced concession snack.

4821420,4,B005LAII4E,"Riddled with bad reactions from test audiences and plagued by re-shoots and 3D conversion during post, not many people believed that this film would ever be released. Alas, almost an entire year after it's original release date, G.I. Joe: Retaliation has finally seen the light of day. Compared to it's predecessor released four years ago, it's a stronger and better film, although it's still completely over-the-top and lacking in any meaningful plot. With that being said, it's a hell of a lot of fun!

The premise behind the film involves the G.I. Joes being framed for the theft of nuclear warheads by master-of-disguise Zartan, who is impersonating the Commander in Chief (Jonathan Pryce). The fake President gives the order to eliminate the team of Joes, culminating the annihilation of their leader Duke and the rest of the team, save for three members; Roadblock (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) and Flint (relative new-comer D.J. Cotrona). Together, along with the help of Snake Eyes and Jinx, the Joes go after Cobra Commander, Zartan, Storm Shadow, and the rest of the baddies to put a stop to their maniacal plans for world domination.

Johnson continues to prove he's one of Hollywood's most entertaining action stars, as he plays the part of the typical macho man with ease. His on-screen camaraderie with Channing Tatum is easy and believable, and he delivers his one-liners perfectly. It was also nice to see Palicki, of Friday Night Lights fame, in the female ass-kicker role, and Bruce Willis is very John McClane-ish in his cameo, which makes for some fun on-screen moments. One of the standouts for me was Pryce, who completely owns his role as the Zartan-impersonated President, and has some of the best lines of dialogue in the movie.

There's some great stunt work and special effect moments that make this movie a blast to watch. One in particular that comes to mind is a breathtaking sequence that involves a sheer cliff and ninjas...need I say more? The CGI looks better than in the preceding film as well. When it comes down to it, I think there was only one goal the filmmaking team was trying to achieve with G.I. Joe: Retaliation, and that was to entertain. Do yourself a favor and grab some buddies, pop some popcorn, and enjoy this kick-ass action flick.",1364774400,52,2311,4.90537084398977
4821421,4,B005LAII4E,"Let's start by stating the obvious: the plot is far from credible, basically akin to the simplicity of a cartoon supervillain with an over-the-top plan and he needs to be stopped by the good guys.

Still licking their wounds from the insufferable G. I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra (2009), our super-soldiers led by Captain Duke (Channing Tatum) introduce the pace of this movie with an action sequence against overseas enemies.  The down side: after a successful mission the president orders an air strike to kill the whole team and frames them for some pretty serious war crimes, painting them terrorists.  They lose a lot of good men.  But the best of them, thought to be dead with the others, made it out alive...and something smells fishy!

What's that smell?  Well, it turns out that the president of the United States has been kidnapped by Cobra operatives, with one of them impersonating the president with some sort of nanotechnology that perfectly emulates facial structure and voice.  There's are first heaping spoonful of over the top.

Cobra operatives' next step is to free their imprisoned Cobra Commander, who is in an underground super prison, and then bluff a nuclear coup to disarm the world's nuclear powers and then threaten the world with a new, special weapon of their own design.  Waaaaaaaaay over the top.  When you see the world leaders meet to discuss nuclear disarmament it feels like a 12-year old wrote out the drama.  But, I guess this movie is for the 12-year olds, too, so I'll leave it alone.

Roadblock (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), freerunner Flint (D.J. Cotrona), the sultry Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki), Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and Jinx (Elodie Yung) face off against Zartan, Cobra Commander, Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) and Firefly (Ray Stevenson).  There's also a painful ninja clan cameo by rapper-filmmaker Rza, who reprises his woodenly stale performance from The Man with the Iron Fists. Bruce Willis also joins the Joes.

The action sequences vary in quality.  I found the movie's opener to be a little weak.  But later sequences and, especially, the mountain ninja clan battle between Snake Eyes and Jinx and Storm Shadow's minions was quite good.  Likewise, a battle between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow along with Jinx training with Snake Eyes were also quite cool.  Leave it to the ninjas to save the day.  But they can't take all the credit.  Flint's freerunning assaults on Cobra, Roadblock versus Firefly, the Cobra Commander prison break and the big finale offer a lot of entertainment as well.

This movie is as entertaining as your ability to check your brain at the door and try to remember the scenarios you were playing out with action figures when you were a kid.  All the sudden, ""the president needs saving again"" starts to feel more natural.",1364688000,8,2794,4.9
4821422,3,B005LAII4E,"As stated in some of the other reviews, this movie has some killer action stunts.  I do like the action in this movie.  I also think the acting is good.  ""The Rock"" does a great job in his part.  Bruce Willis is also great and the other actors play their parts well too.  If this movie was named something else I would give this movie 5 stars; however, as a G I Joe movie it is missing.  I think the writers left some stuff out.  Your next question might be ""What did they leave out""?  Well I never herd ""Yo Joe"" once in the whole movie, there was only one futuristic weapon in the whole movie, and too many of the well-known Joe's die.  The other Joe movie at least had futuristic weapons and yells the catch line often.  In this movie, the weapons were standard guns and I repeat no catch phrase in the whole movie.  The acting was better and it had a better story line other than G I Joe movie other than the already listed flaws.  As a lifelong G I Joe fan, I can only give this movie 3 stars.",1364688000,7,997,4.056410256410256

8477869,3,B005LAII4E,Even though I didn't get any real enjoyment out of the movie - I gave it 3**** for just the effort put into the special effects. Other than that it was a waste of time - shut off 1/2 hour before ending - it just kept getting more and more boring. The first movie was much better - probably most sequels cant measure up to first go around because they wore out the story line. Watch at your own risk - it will work better than Sominex.,1529020800,,434,4.0
