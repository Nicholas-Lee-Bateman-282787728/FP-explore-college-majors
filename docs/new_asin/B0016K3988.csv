3157212,4,B0016K3988,"This is a slow, beautiful film about several generations of families in a small Turkish village, but more generally, it is about the anger and hurt that is so often passed down from generation to generation, in a repeating cycle of cause and effect. My tag line for this film might be ""One generation must end, before the next can truly begin to live"". Don't watch it if you are in a hurry, or it will probably frustrate you. But if you have a couple hours to kill, with few expectations and can simply take it for what it is, your life might just be enriched just a little, which is more than you will get from most films.

3157213,4,B0016K3988,"Writer and director Reha Erdem situates his film in a mountainous Turkish village to explore the rhythms of nature and multi-generational family strife. He tells the story from the perspective of three adolescent classmates. Omer hates his imam father; he dreams, prays, and plans how he might die. His best friend Yakup is infatuated with the school teacher and enraged when he catches his own father leering at her through a window. Yildiz slaves away like all the women in this movie, cooking, cleaning, and caring for her baby brother. All the themes of adolescent coming of age emerge here -- birth and death, sex and shame, guilt and longing, fear and confusion, oedipal love and male violence, nationalism and religion. The imperatives of nature surround everyone, with spectacular scenes of mountains and sea, wind and rain, a cloudy moon and a solar eclipse, animals mating, birthing, and being butchered. Erdem organizes the film around Islam's five calls to prayer, but in reverse order as if to accentuate the disorientation of adolescence: night, evening, afternoon, noon, and morning.

3157216,4,B0016K3988,"BAS VAKIT (TIME AND WINDS) is less a narrative film than a suspended contemplation on the cycle of life, the passage of time, and the persistence of family traits.  It is a work from Turkey of rare beauty visually, musically, and natural grandeur. Writer/director Reha Erdem is a poet as well as an accomplished filmmaker.

Three young children are approaching the torrents of adolescence, each carrying emotional scars and family histories that will forever alter the way they reach adulthood.  Omer (Ozkan Ozen) is the son of the local imam who climbs the minaret five times a day to chant the call to prayer: Omer's younger, smarter brother is favored by the father and Omer copes with the loathing for his father  by planning his death.  Yakup (Ali Bey Kayali), Omer's closest friend, has a crush on his teacher (Selma Erge) but is deeply disillusioned when he spies on his own father (whom he has always defended against his grandfather's abuse) attempting to court his teacher. Yildiz (Elit Iscan) is a girl under-appreciated by her mother and is stunned to overhear her parents coupling.  The three children attempt to engage in a normal childhood, reacting tot he beauty of the natural surroundings of their poor little village to the point of learning animal husbandry first hand! They befriend another young orphan Davut (Tarik Sonmez), the town shepherd, when he sustains physical abuse from his guardian.  The sensitivity of the children's reflections of their parents' maladaptive behavior creates a bond that sustains their daily trials.

There is not a lot of narrative here, but the sensory pleasures of the film are immense.  Divided into sections labeled Night, Evening, Afternoon, Noon and Morning, the film follows the marriage of the calls to worship that clock the lives of these people with the atmospheric cinematography by Florent Herry and embellished by the sumptuous musical score by Arvo Prt.  It is a long film (just short of two hours) that takes its time to unfold the mysteries of coming of age and it is a film that will haunt the viewer long after the credits have ceased.  In Turkish with English subtitles. Grady Harp, August 08",1217808000,21,2165,4.95303867403315
3157217,2,B0016K3988,The viewer needs to be creative in determining the deeper theme(s) of the film . . . I'm not sure if I was successful.  I did appreciate the detailed entry into the various family units in the traditional small eastern Mediterranean village.  There is a strong sense of hopelessness expressed by most of the characters so don't expect a boost towards an emotional high by the time the credits start rolling.  A/the highlight of the story was the clear conviction of the village elders to honor their responsibility to care for those members of the community that are not attached to a family unit.  I'm very happy it was 'free' to watch. . . I might have felt short-changed if I had paid even a single euro to see it.,1425340800,,717,4.492307692307692
3157218,2,B0016K3988,"This movie script seems to have been written by someone who deeply dislikes rural Turkish culture.  Myself, I have no experience of it, but as you watch this movie, you come to the realization that the writer is showing the pattern of life as experienced by a handful of children who are coming of age in this ancient society.  This pattern is bleak and inescapable, though it may have certain joys and hopes for the future.  In the end, the characters either accept their fates as part of a timeless cycle, or they weep, knowing that whatever hopes they have are doomed.

Given that the imagery and themes are so beautiful to me, it is jarring to see the main characters act in such depressing manner.  What could have been a stirring movie that calls to mind the timeless themes of life, turns out to be a bitter lamentation of the same.  The writer of this script is altogether wrongheaded, and thus so is the film.",1421280000,,918,4.5

Emotionally, it felt rather empty. The situations depicted were powerful, but I never felt emotionally connected to the people, so the events lacked emotional impact. The three kids who are central to the plot lacked personality and felt generic. You cared about them because they're kids, and human beings, but not as likable individuals.

I did appreciate a girl being included in the cast, a female coming-of-age story being included. That was a HUGE plus for me. That plus the fact that this is one of the most purely beautiful films I've ever seen pushes it to four stars.",1398816000,,809,4.7304964539007095

Now there are others that will argue about it's realistic portrial of country life or the interaction of flawed family dynamics or some other artistic quality.  All I can say is that it was a depressing look at the lives of children, their live of poverty, mistreatment and their inability to escape it.  If that appeals to you.  You've found your movie.

3157228,3,B0016K3988,"This is a beautifully produced film. The cinematography, the music, the acting, along with the spectacular scenery of this hillside village overlooking the sea, all provide a visual and aural feast.

Unfortunately, as a westerner I found myself wondering if I'd understand the film better with some help. Granted, there are definitely some elements to the film that are almost certainly meant as artistic rather than literal, including the occasional unseen horse whinnying (I never did see a horse in the film...just a lot of goats) and numerous moments showing one of the children lying asleep on the ground somewhere (on the rocks, in the hay, in the shrubs, etc.).

But other aspects, such as the relative lack of progress (a baby is born, and two brothers build a wall, but mostly other than that each person seems to be just living the same routine day after day), and the general malaise that seems to have befallen the village (while the children occasionally laugh at something they find amusing, the birth is the one moment in the entire movie when someone seems to be experiencing a genuinely joyful moment), I can't tell if these are meant also to be part of the art of the film or truly reflective of life in a village like this.

Likewise, the relationships between nearly every person in the film seems to be indifferent at best, and in most of the close ones, there's at least an undercurrent of abuse, if not an outright expression of it.

I found the whole experience very sad. But the fact is, if a film is supposed to be an expression, drawing the viewer in emotionally, this one succeeds. It was a treat to watch and while I may not have understood it well enough to really ""get it"", I did not at all regret the nearly two hours spent with it.",1390608000,4,1764,4.60828025477707
3157229,5,B0016K3988,"A film like this is very much like reading an astounding poem. It evokes a universe in a drop of water. Only the greats can do this. It brings to mind Bergman and Bunuel, of course, and more recently Reygadas and Zvyagintsev. If you have the mind for this sort of film, it easily becomes what you most hunt for. Having Arvo Part do the music sure didn't hurt. It helped make this one of those gems that reassures one that art is still being created. But you're not going to be on the bunny slope with this one.

3157231,2,B0016K3988,"This film was interesting, but very confusing without cultural context. For example, why did the school teacher not wear a head scarf, but all of the other mature women of the village did? What was the reasoning for the one boy's hatred of his father? Was his attempt to push him off the cliff purely imaginary? Whose funeral do we see? Does the film jump around in time, or is it chronological? What does the girl hear behind the door? Sex? That was not clear other than the fact that she tells the other girl when they're watching the mating donkeys that their parents do it too. I could list many more.

Even across the language barrier, I felt by the end that I had known those chaacters for years, and known that village.  Some may say that there was little plot and that nothing happened. But the plot lay in the family tensions between generations, right down to questions of who would survive nomal life, and how.  Most of our life's dramas are played out on the small stages of families, villages, and in the character-forging drama of small, nearly-silent personal apocalypses.  The writing was spare and tight, almost Cormac McCarythesque.  Author Michael Lindvall once said that true heroism was in loving the same people for a long time.

It all should add up to a genuinely lovely yet poignant film but it just didn't for me. I should have been moved by the drudgery and sadness of their lives but I just wasn't. I should have felt something but I just didn't it. Perhaps the idyllic setting tempered the malaise in such way that it overwhelmed the melodrama. You'd have to see it for yourself to decide.

It brings to mind Bergman and Bunuel, of course, and more recently Reygadas and Zvyagintsev. If you have the mind for this sort of film, it easily becomes what you most hunt for. Having Arvo Part do the music sure didn't hurt. It helped make this one of those gems that reassures one that art is still being created. But you're not going to be on the bunny slope with this one. It's the black diamond and nobody's going to hold your hand.",1385769600,3,571,4.2

3391728,2,B0016K3988,"This film was interesting, but very confusing without cultural context. For example, why did the school teacher not wear a head scarf, but all of the other mature women of the village did? What was the reasoning for the one boy's hatred of his father? Was his attempt to push him off the cliff purely imaginary? Whose funeral do we see? Does the film jump around in time, or is it chronological? What does the girl hear behind the door? Sex? That was not clear other than the fact that she tells the other girl when they're watching the mating donkeys that their parents do it too. I could list many more.

But the plot lay in the family tensions between generations, right down to questions of who would survive nomal life, and how.  Most of our life's dramas are played out on the small stages of families, villages, and in the character-forging drama of small, nearly-silent personal apocalypses.  The writing was spare and tight, almost Cormac McCarythesque.  Author Michael Lindvall once said that true heroism was in loving the same people for a long time.  This is a film about that capacity.",1376438400,2,811,4.875912408759124

I should have felt something but I just didn't it. Perhaps the idyllic setting tempered the malaise in such way that it overwhelmed the melodrama. You'd have to see it for yourself to decide.

8262777,5,B0016K3988,"Its astonishing, when experiencing this incredible film, to reflect on the fact that this is writer / director Reha Erdems first feature. Everything about it  the story and dialogue, the pacing, the framing and the absolutely stunning cinematography  reflects skills normally acquired only after years of experience behind the camera. Its really that fine a creation.

Erdems film tells a coming-of-age story  a popular premise in cinematic endeavors, but in the case of Times and winds, placed in a very different setting: a small village in rural Turkey. The film is gently and naturally divided into five sections, after the traditional Islamic practice of five calls to prayer, made at appointed hours during the day and night. Its a reminder of the spiritual forces governing the lives of the villagers  but there is no depiction of a militant interpretation of Islam here, no injection of politics into religious practice. There are strict rules governing the villagers lives, but there is no prohibition of education for girls, and no separation by sex within the classes  this is Islam as practiced and applied in Turkey, not the hard-line extremism that exists in other places.

At the center of the film are three children (Omer, Yakup and Yildiz  two boys and a girl, respectively) doing emotional battle with the transition into adolescence  a universal struggle, one that can be witnessed in any society anywhere on the globe. Childhood curiosity extends into adult feelings and actions that begin to be noticed and experienced  games and idle time wandering through the nearby fields and mountains are still treasured, but also included is a scene wherein the two boys are shown giggling as they watch two animals copulate  their teachings and sense of propriety are awakened, however, when they notice that their friend Yildiz is watching from another angle. Their embarrassment and shame induces them to chase her away.

Omers father is the village imam  the favoritism he shows toward Omers younger brother (a precocious child who does much better in school than Omer) ignites a powerful and potentially dangerous flame of jealousy. Omer actively and consciously wishes his father dead, going so far as to painstakingly empty the capsules prescribed by the imams doctor to treat the old mans respiratory condition. Omers emotional distance from his father  indeed, from the rest of his family  is visually underscored in a scene in which a family portrait is being taken, his father having to physically pull the boy into the family grouping for the picture.

Yakup is infatuated with the childrens schoolteacher  a beautiful young woman who seems very dedicated to educating and caring for her students. The villagers show their gratitude to her by delivering regular gifts of bread and meats to her door. Omer teases Yakup about his feelings, but not too much  the boys are, after all, friends, and Omer senses that Yakups emotions are real, perhaps even knowing those sorts of pangs himself. When Yakup arrives at the teachers house to deliver a gift of goats meat, he is stunned and crushed to catch his father surreptitiously peeking into one of her windows, apparently in an attempt to see her partly clothed. Its a cold slap in the face to one so young and innocent  but its not a perfect world in which we live, and the village where the children live certainly has its share of hypocrites and sinners/

Yildizs mother craves an additional child  after suffering through a difficult pregnancy, she delivers a son, then proceeds to transform Yildiz into a servant, saddling the girl with chores and tasks more fitting to one much older. The young girl feels put upon, but loves her little brother, and takes her responsibilities as seriously as one could expect in a child her age. When she trips while carrying the baby, dropping him onto the ground, her mother and most of the village react in horror, blaming her for carelessness. The shock of what has happened actually causes Yildiz to faint  she lies alone on the ground, unconscious, until her father comes along and picks her up lovingly in his arms to comfort her.

Perhaps none of these plot elements in themselves seem unusual or particularly noteworthy  as in the cases of many films, however, Times and winds is a creation that is much larger than the simple sum of its parts. This is due to several important factors / aspects, each of them being of extraordinary quality and imbued with a deep-felt spirit of humanity struggling with itself, its fate intertwined and inseparably connected with the natural world. As I mentioned early on, the cinematography in this film is breathtakingly beautiful  night or day, village or countryside, faces or surroundings, the framing is nothing short of perfect. The director has placed his subjects and their environment on the screen in such a way as to gently stress their ties to one another, at the same time drawing the viewer into the film like a magnet. Steadycam shots of characters moving along dusty streets and alleyways convey a palpable sensation of motion and underscore the claustrophobic characteristics of the architecture as well as those of the characters very lives. The childrens forays into the mountains are, Im sure, a response to this feeling of containment, which is a form of emotional and cultural imprisonment  in the outdoors, lying on a mountain plateau, watching the clouds move above and the lay of the land below, they are free to exchange ideas and feelings in the open and honest manner that is so natural in children. For example, Omers confession to Yakup that he wishes his father dead is met not with horror, but with practical concerns about consequences. There are also repeated images  disturbing and beautiful at the same time  of the individual children lying apparently dead among rubble or brush. At first I thought them asleep  the shot of Yildiz especially depicts a peaceful, sleep-like repose, but one of the boys is shown on the ground among broken stones and bricks, with debris partially covering him.

Another factor in the success of this project is the young actors themselves  Erdem carefully chose non-professionals for the roles, and the youngsters are nothing short of perfect in embodying their characters. This results in a feeling that we are almost spying on these children, from a fly-on-the-wall viewpoint, observing without being observed. The natural ease they bring to their roles is a wonderful thing to experience. The dialogue throughout the film is realistic as well, and never explodes into wordiness  there are no long soliloquies or overly deep, length philosophical discussions. This is the stuff of life, and its presented in such a way as to make it fascinating to watch.

Last but certainly not least, the music chosen by Erdem to accompany his film is achingly beautiful  Estonian composer Arvo Prts work is featured, and the gentle, drawn-out figures for which the composer has become rightly admired are the perfect audio frame for the films stunningly lovely images.

Writing more about the plot would give too much away  but, that being said, Times and winds is not as much of a plot-driven film as it is a slice-of-life portrait of the three young protagonists and their physical and cultural environment. Theres enough of a plot, and enough action to retain the interest of most viewers, I believe  but the film, to me, is more of an experiential type of cinema, in which one can immerse oneself and emerge feeling a little closer to understanding not only the characters and the lives they live, but humanity in general and the earth on which we live.",1468540800,2,7668,4.971830985915493

The treatment isn't for everyone, but if you enjoy a story that explores rather than follows a plot, you'll appreciate the cycle or stage of life these children are moving through, as did innumerable generations before them. As they lose bits of childhood, it's like a small death inside each time, and it becomes increasingly clear to them and to us where their lives are headed.
