2705407,5,B000LC3IR4,"When I was younger, approx. 15 or 16 I worked at a pizza parlor. They played these old movies up on the wall for the customers to watch as they ate their pizza. I would sit and watch people laughing as they ate, and I would love it. Well... these movies are STILL that funny today. My kids even love to watch them, for thats who I bought them for. Between Mr. Chaplin and Mr. Keaton my kids will laugh for hours. This set is WELL worth the money... especially for as many hours of movie shorts there are per disc. A good buy to sit and enjoy some quiet time with your family. Buy, laugh, and enjoy!!!",1194307200,6,600,4.093220338983051
2705408,4,B000LC3IR4,"If you'd like to familiarize yourself with Buster Keaton's work this is a great place to start. For ten dollars you pretty much get to sample the works of his entire career. Of course you don't get the video quality you have in ""The Art of Buster Keaton"", but then you don't pay one hundred plus dollars either. You get fifteen of the two reelers he made from 1920 - 1923 when he was getting started as a filmmaker, plus two of the feature films he made as an independent - ""The General"" (1927) and ""Steamboat Bill Jr."" (1928). ""The General"" is touted by many as his finest achievement, and ""Steamboat Bill Jr."" is the last film he made before he was forced to go to work for MGM in 1928 due to the withdrawal of financial support he had from his benefactor and brother-in-law, Joe Schenck. From the years 1920-1928 Keaton had complete creative control of his films.

Chronologically speaking, the next feature is ""Parlor, Bedroom, & Bath"" (1931), Keaton's third talkie and his fifth feature film for MGM.  Although Keaton had been promised some creative control of his films at MGM, it never came to be, and by the time ""Parlor, Bedroom, & Bath"" was made Keaton had been relegated to the role of performer. The film has some funny parts, particularly when Keaton is on screen with Charlotte Greenwood, but overall Keaton is relegated to the role of a naive man-child in a farce. Keaton hated farces, and being put in films and roles he hated with absolutely no say is part of what drove him to drink.

The other two features - ""Lil' Abner"" and ""The Villain Still Pursued Her"" from 1940 are examples of Keaton's post-MGM work. Here he is in supporting roles - he never stars in another American-made feature film for the rest of his career after 1933 due to the beating his reputation took after he was fired from MGM because of his alcoholism.

If you like what you see, particularly in the silent shorts, The General, and Steamboat Bill Jr., you might think about saving your pennies and investing in ""The Art of Buster Keaton"" and see the rest of the shorts and features Keaton did when he had complete control - you won't regret it. If you watch ""The General"" and then ""Parlor, Bedroom, & Bath"" and wonder ""what happened in between these two films???"" I also recommend TCM Archives' Buster Keaton Collection. It contains the first three films Keaton did for MGM (The Cameraman/Spite Marriage/Free & Easy) and contains commentary for the two silent films in the collection. Plus there is a documentary included that explains MGM's role in dismantling Keaton's career.",1189123200,16,2570,4.666666666666667
2705409,5,B000LC3IR4,"I was very happy when I received this ""Buster Keaton Collection - 15 Shorts, 5 Movies"" dvd set yesterday! I already own ""The Art of Buster Keaton"" Kino dvd set (Don't worry: I purchased the set used at a fairly low discount price -- about $118.00). But I leave that set at home. When I read the two reviews for this ""BK Collection"", and the 15 classic silent shorts on them, I wanted this to keep at my job.

I'll briefly explain: I have a portable dvd player I keep at work so I can occasionally watch something during my lunch break. I have a few fun dvds I keep in my desk drawer: Dastardly and Muttley, Beavis and Butt-Head, and three Buster Keaton classics: ""The Saphead"", ""The Navigator"" and ""Battling Butler"". (Take note, Buster fans, these three titles involve Keaton's rich spoiled characters!).

Now, by having this ""BK Collection"", I can enjoy watching Buster in many of his classic silent two-reelers during lunch (particularly, my favorite ones) -- at least, until my break is over. Some prints are a bit grainy, yet watchable. But I'm not too concerned about the film quality as I already have the Keaton Kino set.

Yesterday, I watched ""Cops"". The organ score is exactly that from my first BK videotape I owned, in 1985, from Blackhawk Films - ""The Blacksmith""/""Cops"". I was a high school senior, then!

Today I enjoyed watching ""The Goat"", which is truly funny! My favorite scene, of course, is the most famous: With Buster sitting on the cowcatcher of a train, staring directly at us stonefaced when the train stops before the camera.

Whenever I'm ready, I'll watch ""The General"", or ""Steamboat Bill, Jr."" -- preferably portions of them.  Even ""Parlor, Bedroom and Bath"" if I wish to hear Buster's cute gravelly voice! I glimpsed at ""The Villain Still Pursued Her"". This isn't classic Keaton, of course. Yet, it seems lightly amusing. I have yet to watch it in its entirety.

Anyway, I'm very pleased with this mini Keaton dvd set! You get quite a lot of classic Keaton at such a low price! I love it, and Buster!",1187740800,8,2031,4.64066852367688
2705410,5,B000LC3IR4,"Buster Keaton wrote and directed most of his two and three-reelers with Eddie Cline, who also appears in several of them (as Edward F. Cline). Keaton is considered one of the Big Three silent-era comedians, along with Harold Lloyd and Charles Chaplin.

Highlights of this marvelous three DVD set:

""The General"" is a cinematic classic-- nothing less. This is a movie everyone should see. It's a great introduction to the silent film genre. Keaton's amazing acrobatic skills, his dead aim, pantomimic ability and expressive mannerisms have never been put to better use, or topped by anyone, anywhere.

""The Play House"" is a most remarkable short. In the space of 20 minutes, Keaton manages to portray 20 different roles: he's the audience, actors, orchestra and a stagehand. A tour-de-force!

""Steamboat Bill Jr."" contains Keaton's most dangerous stunt. A wall topples over and the stationary and upright Buster is positioned precisely so that he passes harmlessly through an open window, the wall landing on the ground around him. This was such a hazardous trick, half of the production crew walked off in protest rather than be witness to Keaton possibly getting killed by this plummeting object.

""Parlor, Bedroom & Bath"" is a pre-code comedy that showcases Keaton's comedic talents in a speaking part. Also in this film is Cliff Edwards, who was once known as Ukulele Ike.  Edwards' most famous role was the voice of Jiminy Cricket in PINOCCHIO. His recording of ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" won an Academy Award in 1941.

In ""Li'l Abner,"" Keaton has a supporting role. In this one he's a dead ringer for Lonesome Polecat, the little Indian who brews Kickapoo Joy Juice in an enormous cast iron cauldron. The other actors here are also remarkable look-alikes who bring to life their comic strip characters. Although the script is slight, this is still a fun movie.

2705411,4,B000LC3IR4,"I own a few other Buster Keaton sets and I really enjoyed this collection. My favorite Keaton movie is the Cameraman, I think that even though it was made at the time he signed with MGM and his career ended shortly after, it was one of his best.  That was the only thing I think this collection was missing, the Cameraman.  I pre-ordered this item because where else can you find a set with serveral short films, full length films and bonus features of Keaton for about ten dollars?",1174608000,8,482,4.404494382022472
8161460,4,B000LC3IR4,"I love Buster Keaton's cinematic techniques and humor. He is such an innovator. I saw a picture of one of my favorite Keaton films, The Navigator, on the cover, but when I bought it, it turned out that movie was NOT included in this collection. That's my reason for the 4 stars instead of 5.",1468886400,,291,4.3090909090909095
8161461,4,B000LC3IR4,"This is such a fun compilation. I bought it mainly for the movie ""The General"" which is fantastic. It doesn't have the best soundtrack attached to that film, but it is still works well. All the other Buster Keaton shorts are great!",1441152000,,231,4.523809523809524
8161462,3,B000LC3IR4,"I don't tend to discuss the stories.  Too many others do this for me to waste your time.  I prefer to tell you whether the disc is a worthy purchase.

This collection suffers from poor source material and worse attention to the musical score.  The music is rather random and the original scores are absent.  Music is grossly important to any silent because it sets the tone and mood of the movie; often punctuating the action.  In the days of the silents they spent as much time on the score as the movie. This is a collection for a person who dabbles in silent films and wants to see if this is something they might like.  If you are on a budget and can not, or do not care to afford the vastly superior Kino collection then by all means enjoy.  None of these movies (excepting the General) is so bad they are difficult to watch and if you want to test the waters before getting into silent movies this may be the kind of thing to try.  If you think you don't like them  or are just neutral after seeing these try renting one or two high quality versions you may think differently.  People who enjoy physical comedy usually tend to enjoy silent movies. (Note:  I have written an entire other review of The General, often cited as one of the best movies ever made.  If you are new to silent movies buy this one from Kino)

Disclaimer:  This collection was given to me as a Christmas gift so I can't certify that it was purchased at Amazon.",1344038400,,1439,4.297397769516729
8161463,1,B000LC3IR4,"The music doesn't fit the action, and the films prints don't look restored.  Purchased a Chaplin collection by St. Clair Vision then found better prints from Image.  Will do the same with Keaton.  I won't purchase any St. Clair discs, again.",1235865600,,241,4.829268292682927
8161464,4,B000LC3IR4,"This is abusolutely a stunning offer to Keaton buffs who have been hesitant to purchase some other Keaton's DVD sets which cost a lot more than this one.

The content is incredibly opulent for its highly affordable price.

In addition to the well-known short and feature silent comedies,
this set invites you to a few rare talkies that are, in my opinion, very valuable as they allow us to see how one of our greatest silent comedians endeavours to fit into the completely new environmentFthe talkie era.

The quality of the image of each picture is by no means excellent although the maker of this DVD set states that they have remastered the films to let us enjoy them in the best possible quality, however not serious enough to be the reason for star minus evaluation.

The only disappointment is the omission of subtitles for the talkies

For above reasons,I recommend this product with confidence.",1223424000,,902,4.7935483870967746
8161465,2,B000LC3IR4,"You can't go wrong with Buster, but in the set I bought, some of the DVD's won't play on any machine--computer or DVD player.  If you get this set, make sure you play through all the DVDs right away to make sure they're not defective.",1221609600,,234,4.2
8161466,3,B000LC3IR4,"I liked the fact that this dvd contained many shorts, and later projects I had yet to view.  It is a good price for so much stuff, but I did feel it was slightly misleading.  On the cover it shows a some pictures of movies that are not even included they are The Navigator, and The Cameraman.  When I was reading what was included I stumbled across a title of  a short I have never heard before ""Her Painted Hero""  Excited to find a short I never saw before I looked for it right away.  I soon discovered Buster never made a short, and I wondered why they would put the title of a film that doesn't even exist.  Over all I liked that it had many shorts on here, but some of the music they chose doesn't fit at all.",1218412800,,714,4.0212765957446805
8161467,4,B000LC3IR4,"First the bad news. The speed seems to be a little slow on The General. I'm not sure about the others since I haven't watched everything yet. The shorts seemed to be okay though. And second, I have to agree that some of the music they chose is horrible. There is absolutely no reason why Pomp and Circumstance should be playing during a Buster Keaton short. It just doesn't go. Some of the other music was off putting too but for such a low price I can overlook it.
Now for the good news. The convenience of having everything all in one box is very attractive. So bad music choices aside I would still buy the set. What better way to sample the full range of what Buster Keaton can do without spending lots of money? This set is so full I'll be busy for weeks.
Buster Keaton was truly a talented (and insane) man and certainly well worth watching. My favorites so far are The General and (the short) One Week. They make the set worthwhile all by themselves. The General especially is inventive, full of great action and great slapstick. So who cares if the music isn't that great? Just turn it down and enjoy.",1216425600,,1109,4.36231884057971
8161468,2,B000LC3IR4,"While it is a delight to see Buster Keaton and his masterful comic timing, the music chosen for these masterpieces is ALL WRONG!  It is truly annoying to have the music from the Douglas Fairbanks' Thief of Bagdad playing while watching The General--where is the Civil War music that went with the film?  ( When Johnny Comes Marching Home and Dixie are painfully missing )

would it really have been too much to have music that fit with each film? This is enough of an omission to lower my vote to 2 stars.",1208649600,10,505,4.408602150537634
8161469,5,B000LC3IR4,"These Buster Keaton movies are in a class of their own. You wonder why everyone always goes on about Chaplin-these are miles better. Keaton has a balletic grace, and his scrapes seem  both inevitable and tragic. My children (ages 13, 10, 8 and 5) all love them too. Classics in the true sense of the word!!",1202428800,2,306,4.464285714285714
