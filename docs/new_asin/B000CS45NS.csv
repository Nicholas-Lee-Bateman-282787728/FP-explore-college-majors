8101425,5,B000CS45NS,"Beautiful and strange stories. Thomas Gibson is really perfect in this role...he brings a dimension to the film, otherwise history serat quite hazy, Thomas Gibson captivates the viewers with him were vied to be guided to the end ... and even then, we would like to continue to watch the film .... endless ...",1426464000,2,308,4.722222222222222

8101427,3,B000CS45NS,"Nightmare Street might not have been the best movie I've ever seen, but its parallel-worlds suspense was fun. As the heroine's love interest jokingly says, ""... Maybe I could sell your story to the tabloids."" I did enjoy the way he introduced scientific explanations into the story.

I readily admit that I am a sucker for stuff like this, and always have been. If this was a personal review, and not for public consumption, I would have given it at least four stars.

See it and decide for yourself. It's worth your time.",1190419200,2,522,4.602150537634409
8101428,1,B000CS45NS,"A promising subject from which to craft absorbing narrative design: an awareness of the existence of spatial dimensions parallel to our own, made more compelling by a widespread latter-day theory among physicists that the concept of time itself is a spurious construct, is treated here as merely an element for the production of a silly science fantasy story, having a weak merger of talent that condemns the film to failure from its onset.  Any possible form of dramatic intent wants drive in this simple-minded tale based upon inferior material, an account telling of Joanna Burke (Sherilyn Fenn) who has ostensibly moved over into ""the other side"" after being mowed down by a semi-trailer truck as she is saving the life of her young daughter who is about to be flattened by the same vehicle.  After awakening in a hospital, Joanna is informed that she is actually Sarah Randolph, whereas Joanna Burke and her daughter do not, in fact, exist, and it falls upon bewildered Joanna to solve this puzzle of her identity, a task for which she might not have competence, and exacerbated by Sarah's being of an unpleasant sort, perhaps to the point of having strangled her eight year old son to death.  A romantic thread is unsurprisingly engendered when the physician treating Joanna/Sarah, played by Thomas Gibson, is determined to become involved with her predicament, and the two struggle along together, when not embracing or seeking to avoid close attention being paid to murder suspect Sarah by a zealous police detective who seemingly has only the Randolph homicide case assigned to him.  Overly discursive plot development effaces any chance of suspense being constructed, particularly as to whether or not Joanna will be able to regain her former self along with her daughter, thereby creating only weak entertainment from a film that is further stricken by a glut of risible flaws in logic and continuity, not solely within the screenplay, but additionally relating to rather queer medical and law enforcement policies and procedures.",1185148800,3,2041,5.1017964071856285
