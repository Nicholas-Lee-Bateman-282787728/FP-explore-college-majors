Got it for the never aired Mr Ed pilot.... interesting differences. Script much the same with aired pilot, but completely different cast (but Ed of course, of course ;) and sets.

The Lassie stuff a nice bonus.

Quality was good, considering all probably from not top quality, circulated 16mm film prints.",1268352000,2,333,4.807017543859649
