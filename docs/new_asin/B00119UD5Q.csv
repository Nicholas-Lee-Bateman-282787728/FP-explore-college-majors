Good one disney you've done well!! :-)

3063578,5,B00119UD5Q,"I have a year and a half old baby girl and she is huge Barney's fan. We thought it would be a good idea to see if she'll like Mickey and got her this dvd. Bingo! She loves it. She can sit quietly and watch the whole DVD (4 episodes) at once. And she dances with them too. Of course she is scared of Pete, but I am always there so she can hold my hand when needed. If I manage to film her doing her Mickey dance (stumping her feet shouting Mickey, MIckey...) I will post it too for everyone to laugh.
Although we bought this dvd at Target, we also had some problems with the running of the dvd. The picture would freeze and that was ugly. But, our DVD player was getting really old and sometimes wouldn't play other dvds as well, so we got a relatively cheap solution at Best Buy - sony dvd for fifty bucks. Now, everything works great. So, it could be that DVD disc is a little bit proficient for older dvd players. I am not a technician, just my thoughts.
Cheers for the Clubhouse!",1225411200,,982,4.0932642487046635
3063579,4,B00119UD5Q,"You will not get any new episodes on this DVD.  All of the episodes are previously aired Disney channel episodes of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.  That said...

This is a good collection of episodes with a common theme that they are all based on or similar to classic Fairy tales.  My daughter loves the ""Donald the Frog"" episode and I love, ""Sleeping Minnie.""

I read that some people had a problem with their dvd.  I don't know if that is common, but I didn't have an issue with mine.  We've watched it maybe three times (they are repeats we've seen, after all) and haven't had any problems.",1224979200,12,587,4.481132075471698
3063580,5,B00119UD5Q,"Great DVD, the stories are great, my son is almost 2 and he watched it three times last weekend and loved the bear and the frog stories. I was worried about the DVD quality after reading some of the reviews but the DVD worked great.",1223856000,,232,4.177777777777778
3063581,5,B00119UD5Q,My son is 2 and loves Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and loves this video.  I like the way they incorporated the fairy tales into the stories.  A wonderful video and I know my son will watch it for a long time.,1223424000,,202,4.025
3063582,1,B00119UD5Q,"I bought this DVD 1 month ago and ""Minnie Red Riding Hood"" episode freezes constantly and has no sound.  The other episodes do work for me so my kids are begging me not to return this copy to Amazon like my last copy.  Both copies were 1 month apart and it still suffers the same issue.  I guess Disney has not ironed out the problem yet.",1223337600,,338,4.090909090909091
3063583,1,B00119UD5Q,"The DVD has a glitch in it. It Won't play all the way thru.
You may want to avoid any hassles on this one, hopefully disney
will iron this wrinkle out for the future!",1223078400,3,166,3.911764705882353
3063584,2,B00119UD5Q,"I ordered this DVD for my 2 yr old and when we got it, the first 2 episodes played wonderfully. When the DVD got to ""Minnie Red Riding Hood"", before the opening credits were finished, the DVD let out an awful noise that startled everyone in the room (the sound is similar to the emergency broadcast system's noise). After several moments of bleeping and frozen-ness, the DVD played again for another several seconds and then blared again. There was no noticeable damage to the disc and wiping it off did nothing to stop the blaring. We tried several times to figure out what was wrong, and every time it did the same thing. I called Amazon's customer service, and they emailed me a return label without any kind of hassle - great customer service - and mailed a second copy of the DVD to us. That DVD arrived today, and wouldn't you know, at the exact same spot of the DVD the exact same thing happened. This makes me think the entire batch/pressing of this DVD for this particular round is defective. Again, Amazon provided quick customer service, emailed me another return label, and will refund my money for the DVD.

Recapping, the content of the DVD held my daughter's attention, it's just that both copies we received were defective. I'm glad Amazon has good customer service who resolved both issues quickly and without hassle.",1222214400,12,1334,4.676595744680851

We are going on a long plane ride soon therefore I decided to buy this DVD for her to keep her entertained on the trip. I was very happy to see that the DVD comes with a Spanish audio option. Mickey Mouse clubhouse is very educational and fun to watch. The animations and colors are great, I don't know a single toddler who doesn't love this show. This specific DVD comes with four episodes 1. Minnie's Mystery, 2. Donald the Frog Prince 3. Minnie Red Riding Hood 4. Sleeping Minnie. My little girls eyes lit up when she saw the DVD and although she hasn't fully watched it yet, I know she will love it, there isn't one episode of this show that she doesn't enjoy.",1461196800,20,949,4.21978021978022

3063847,5,B00119UD5Q,"All of the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse shows are great for my kids.  They really enjoy watching Mickey and actually listen to him when he talks about shapes, colors, etc.  So, having these movies around are great.  The shows themselves are terrific and as long as it has been a while since I have seen them then I don't get too bored if I have to sit and watch them again.

I should probably mention that we do not have cable television so my children only get to watch these shows from the DVDs.  If you have cable then some of the shows might be aired a lot.  When we visit the grandparents they try to keep some of these shows on demand or something and almost always end up with at least one from this DVD.

One other thing that I want to mention is that most of the Disney DVDs come with a rewards code in the front.  Since these DVDs are purchased on Amazon (even if it is directly through Amazon) if the code doesn't work then Disney can't do anything about it.  I believe you can still register the DVD with them but you just can't get the rewards points. (The rules and guidelines change at times so this could have changed by now, too.)",1427932800,2,1141,4.197247706422019

But the thing I love the most is how much she actually learned from them.  Very impressive.  Another mother I was talking to about Mickey Mouse had said how much her son learned from it, and I hadn't even told her that my daughter had too.

Storybook Surprises is awesome.  It gives several short stories of the classics, but puts the mickey twist on them.  This is one of my daughters favorites.",1421107200,,564,4.534653465346534

3063877,1,B00119UD5Q,"Ok, my son loves Mickey, especially Mickey Mouse Funhouse.  We purchased several of the DVDs as Christmas gifts.

Much to our surprise, there is no easy way to put the content the DVDs on his Android tablet.... it will only allow you to copy the product to I-devices (must use iTunes), or devices with windows media player installed.  He is turning 3 soon, and I just can't justify purchasing anything other than an inexpensive tablet.  This thing comes with a onetime use download code and some copy protection hocus-pocus that does funky crap to you computer and storage devices.....

I understand why Disney wants to protect their intellectual property, but, they need to remember that the people purchasing the DVDs are trying to do it the right way or they would have just downloaded it via some pirate site in the first place.....so my advice to any Android customers is don't buy this DVD.  I know my saying this will have little or no effect on the empire that is Disney, but, if I save one other person some grief, it will be worth it.",1419724800,,1044,4.616216216216216

So I figured I just got a bad one. Went through the exchange process and the new one was just as bad as the original. It's a shame because he really loves this show. But it's not worth trying to exchange it again.

1) There are 4 episodes plus bonus features so you get a lot of Mickey for the price. It's a better value than other Mickey DVD's, with some only having 2 episodes.

2) This is so educational. There is tons of counting, color recognition, games to match items, and they are always on a ""mystery"" to find/save something and it's fun to watch it evolve from start to finish. My children love it!

3) The voices are cute and the characters, in my opinion, are not annoying. They are funny and they talk right to the screen, so it's great to watch children answer back.

4) The familiar and predictable pattern of each show is perfect for toddlers. My children yell out what's coming, and they highly anticipate the ""Hot Dog"" song at the end, as most children do. It's all very catchy and well-written.

5) We don't have cable to watch Playhouse Disney, so it's great they offer these shows on DVD. We also love My Friends Tigger & Pooh on DVD -  another great kid's show. I like that we don't get subjected to promos, ads and other Disney-related luring as seen on the channel. We just get the show on DVD and that's it...no filtering required!

I highly recommend this DVD for toddlers. It will be a great addition to your DVD library! :)",1231718400,152,1510,4.3144876325088335

She can sit quietly and watch the whole DVD (4 episodes) at once. And she dances with them too. Of course she is scared of Pete, but I am always there so she can hold my hand when needed. If I manage to film her doing her Mickey dance (stumping her feet shouting Mickey, MIckey...) I will post it too for everyone to laugh.
Although we bought this dvd at Target, we also had some problems with the running of the dvd. The picture would freeze and that was ugly. But, our DVD player was getting really old and sometimes wouldn't play other dvds as well, so we got a relatively cheap solution at Best Buy - sony dvd for fifty bucks. Now, everything works great. So, it could be that DVD disc is a little bit proficient for older dvd players. I am not a technician, just my thoughts.

When the DVD got to ""Minnie Red Riding Hood"", before the opening credits were finished, the DVD let out an awful noise that startled everyone in the room (the sound is similar to the emergency broadcast system's noise). After several moments of bleeping and frozen-ness, the DVD played again for another several seconds and then blared again. There was no noticeable damage to the disc and wiping it off did nothing to stop the blaring. We tried several times to figure out what was wrong, and every time it did the same thing. I called Amazon's customer service, and they emailed me a return label without any kind of hassle - great customer service - and mailed a second copy of the DVD to us. That DVD arrived today, and wouldn't you know, at the exact same spot of the DVD the exact same thing happened. This makes me think the entire batch/pressing of this DVD for this particular round is defective. Again, Amazon provided quick customer service, emailed me another return label, and will refund my money for the DVD.

We are going on a long plane ride soon therefore I decided to buy this DVD for her to keep her entertained on the trip. I was very happy to see that the DVD comes with a Spanish audio option. Mickey Mouse clubhouse is very educational and fun to watch. The animations and colors are great, I don't know a single toddler who doesn't love this show. This specific DVD comes with four episodes 1. Minnie's Mystery, 2. Donald the Frog Prince 3. Minnie Red Riding Hood 4. Sleeping Minnie. My little girls eyes lit up when she saw the DVD and although she hasn't fully watched it yet, I know she will love it, there isn't one episode of this show that she doesn't enjoy.",1461196800,20,949,4.21978021978022

3298344,5,B00119UD5Q,"All of the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse shows are great for my kids.  They really enjoy watching Mickey and actually listen to him when he talks about shapes, colors, etc.  So, having these movies around are great.  The shows themselves are terrific and as long as it has been a while since I have seen them then I don't get too bored if I have to sit and watch them again.

I should probably mention that we do not have cable television so my children only get to watch these shows from the DVDs.  If you have cable then some of the shows might be aired a lot.  When we visit the grandparents they try to keep some of these shows on demand or something and almost always end up with at least one from this DVD.

One other thing that I want to mention is that most of the Disney DVDs come with a rewards code in the front.  Since these DVDs are purchased on Amazon (even if it is directly through Amazon) if the code doesn't work then Disney can't do anything about it.  I believe you can still register the DVD with them but you just can't get the rewards points. (The rules and guidelines change at times so this could have changed by now, too.)",1427932800,2,1141,4.197247706422019

But the thing I love the most is how much she actually learned from them.  Very impressive.  Another mother I was talking to about Mickey Mouse had said how much her son learned from it, and I hadn't even told her that my daughter had too.

Storybook Surprises is awesome.  It gives several short stories of the classics, but puts the mickey twist on them.  This is one of my daughters favorites.",1421107200,,564,4.534653465346534

3298374,1,B00119UD5Q,"Ok, my son loves Mickey, especially Mickey Mouse Funhouse.  We purchased several of the DVDs as Christmas gifts.

Much to our surprise, there is no easy way to put the content the DVDs on his Android tablet.... it will only allow you to copy the product to I-devices (must use iTunes), or devices with windows media player installed.  He is turning 3 soon, and I just can't justify purchasing anything other than an inexpensive tablet.  This thing comes with a onetime use download code and some copy protection hocus-pocus that does funky crap to you computer and storage devices.....

I understand why Disney wants to protect their intellectual property, but, they need to remember that the people purchasing the DVDs are trying to do it the right way or they would have just downloaded it via some pirate site in the first place.....so my advice to any Android customers is don't buy this DVD.  I know my saying this will have little or no effect on the empire that is Disney, but, if I save one other person some grief, it will be worth it.",1419724800,,1044,4.616216216216216

So I figured I just got a bad one. Went through the exchange process and the new one was just as bad as the original. It's a shame because he really loves this show. But it's not worth trying to exchange it again.

3298604,5,B00119UD5Q,"This is such a great DVD! My daughters are 2 and 1 and they love it! Our friends have boys the same ages and they love it as well. I love that Minnie and Daisy are in every episode - it's nice to see female characters more often. Some other things that are great about it:

1) There are 4 episodes plus bonus features so you get a lot of Mickey for the price. It's a better value than other Mickey DVD's, with some only having 2 episodes.

2) This is so educational. There is tons of counting, color recognition, games to match items, and they are always on a ""mystery"" to find/save something and it's fun to watch it evolve from start to finish. My children love it!

3) The voices are cute and the characters, in my opinion, are not annoying. They are funny and they talk right to the screen, so it's great to watch children answer back.

4) The familiar and predictable pattern of each show is perfect for toddlers. My children yell out what's coming, and they highly anticipate the ""Hot Dog"" song at the end, as most children do. It's all very catchy and well-written.

5) We don't have cable to watch Playhouse Disney, so it's great they offer these shows on DVD. We also love My Friends Tigger & Pooh on DVD -  another great kid's show. I like that we don't get subjected to promos, ads and other Disney-related luring as seen on the channel. We just get the show on DVD and that's it...no filtering required!

I highly recommend this DVD for toddlers. It will be a great addition to your DVD library! :)",1231718400,152,1510,4.3144876325088335

We also find some of it a bit rediculous, like when Mickey fixes a chair with just a hammer. Where are the nails!?
