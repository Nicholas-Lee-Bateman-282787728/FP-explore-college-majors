2444026,5,B000BWFWGO,"i've been a fan of the Shield ever since season 1 came, i was sceptical at first but when i saw all the action that was going on, and the drama that was going on, i quickly became addicted, i then got season 2 which blew me away, great acting, plot, Creators and so forth. Then i got my hands on season 3 which was the best one yet i thought, and season 4 was also exellent. As season 5 aired i knew i couldn't wait for the Dvd release so i downloaded all the episodes (i will buy the dvd) and it was the most intense season yet, i will not spoil anything for you guys but DAMN its good. In my opinion this is one of the best shows ever aired on television and it will remain my favorite forever, if you're a guy and like these type of Cop Drama Action, Corruption, Crime investigation shows, then you OWE it to yourself to check it out, starting with this Boxset, 1-4, trust me if you're a real man, you Will love this!",1151193600,,920,4.005434782608695
2444027,5,B000BWFWGO,"The Shield is possibly one of the greatest shows to ever be on TV.

The show follows several different detectives and police officers within the L.A. area, living out their lives trying to fight crime. The majority of the story follows Vick Mackey and his team: Lem, Shane, and Ronnie. It focuses on their trials and hardships as they try to continue their grip on the city's crime. They'll do anything and everything to keep the streets safe, and I mean anything. When you think you've gotten to the point when you can't be any more surprised, your wrong.

The Shield has an excellent cast. Instead of focussing only on one of the show's characters, it decides to expand and develope all of them. This causes to you have an emotional attachment to even the smallest character in the show, something I've never seen before. The writing and direction are perfect in every way dragging you into the story of each episode. This makes every episode worth watching at least once. You will not want to miss a minute.

Season 1: 5 Stars

Season 2: 4 1/2 Stars

Season 3: 5 Stars

Season 4: 4 Stars

Every season is worth owning on Dvd. I highly reccomend it.",1145145600,4,1151,4.531400966183575
2444028,5,B000BWFWGO,"One of the great trends in US TV over the last decade has been the evolution of the high quality complex adult drama series.

You can almost trace the evolutionary routes that brought us to The Shield.

Hill Street Blues brought us NYPD Blue, then we had Oz, Sopranos and Six Feet Under.

The Shield is like the badly behaved illegitimate off-spring of The Sopranos and NYPD Blue on steroids.

Lead character and morally ambiguous front man Vic Mackey (bullet-headed Michael Chiklis) is an incredibly compelling character, leading an L.A. strike team in a rough city precinct.

The character is brilliantly complex.

He's a money-grabbing corrupt cop, but he still puts runs on the board by putting away the bad guys.

He's a broken machine, but still the most effective means of cleaning up the streets.

Beyond Vic, the other characters are equally complex, unpredictable and illustrative of different human qualities.

Police captain turned Councillor Acevada is the political animal of the series, again showing good and very very bad qualities in equal measure.

Glenn Close does an excellent job of her portrayal of the police captain, too.

Which leads me to point out that The Shield, like Oz and The Sopranos, are shows that have more quality, more compulsion and more addictive quality for the viewer than many, many movies these days.

This is easily the best show to have been on TV for a long time and will throw curve-balls at the viewer to keep them on the edge of their seat.

Lean, mean, tough, gritty and ugly, but oh-so wonderful, too.",1143158400,2,1554,4.840909090909091
2444029,5,B000BWFWGO,"I gave my boyfriend the most romantic presents ever for Valentine's Day, but this is still the one he talks about the most. He loved having all the seasons and this was the best price I found anywhere.",1141257600,,201,4.315789473684211
2444030,5,B000BWFWGO,"I bought all 4 seasons of The Shield together for my boyfriend.  He LOVES the shows and feels they are a good depiction of what ""cop life"" is like, as he is a local police officer.  Anyone that has a cop in their lives or likes a lot of action, would appreciate this series.  I hope you enjoy as well!",1141171200,,301,3.9833333333333334

8093551,5,B000BWFWGO,I wish I had not found this until the series ended. This is so freaking great. I find it hard to wait til the next boxset comes out. (I hate waiting a week for the next episode.),1187136000,,178,3.8378378378378377
8093552,5,B000BWFWGO,Great deal as Stores are charging $49 per season. I got all 4 for $106.....Thanks this will hold me over till next season I hope!,1183420800,,129,4.2
8093553,5,B000BWFWGO,Couldn't stop watching until I had seen all four seasons.  I promptly purchased season 5 and have watched that as well.,1179014400,,119,4.666666666666667
8093554,5,B000BWFWGO,"I had never watched The Shield, but of course I had heard good things about it. Bought this set off the Gold Box sale and it is my new favorite show...I've already sailed through almost all of the four seasons in about three weeks time, bought Season 5 and hope to catch up to the current season. This show is as good and gritty as it gets, with lines of good and evil not only blurring, but overlapping. The show lets you be the judge. Action, character development, social commentary, outstanding performances, suspense and intrigue. I didn't expect to like this show this much.",1176595200,2,580,4.586538461538462
8093555,5,B000BWFWGO,Now I was one of the lucky ones and purchased this 4 season set right around when season 5 came out and they had it listed for VERY VERY cheap.  Amazing deal to a wickedly good series. Amen!,1176422400,,190,4.0
8093556,5,B000BWFWGO,"Gritty, fast paced and riveting. No show handles the Anti-Hero better, except for maybe The Sopranos. The entire show has a documentary feel and you never feel like you are watching overproduced theater like you do with CSI. The story lines are realistic and the characters act like the characters you grow to hate/love.

completely worth the money",1175644800,,348,5.0
8093557,5,B000BWFWGO,I loved watching this from beginning to end.  I already ordered season 5 and can't wait to get it come April.,1174694400,,109,4.190476190476191
8093558,3,B000BWFWGO,"Of course, I love The Shield but have a hard time catching it due to home and work constraints so what better way than to buy the seasons and catch up at my leisure.  It was a lot of fun to get caught up....HOWEVER

I was very disturbed to find that Season 2 was so poorly copied that most of it was lost and couldn't be viewed.  Amazon, being the conglomerate they are won't do anything about replacement.  I plan to buy Season 5 when it comes out, but hopefully from another venue where they may stand behind what they sell a little better.",1169164800,5,542,4.1826923076923075
