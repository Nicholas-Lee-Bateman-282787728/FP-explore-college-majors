7876395,2,6304623461,"LOL! this was the first guitar video I ever bought back in 1995, when I was trying to teach myself guitar. I take ""real"" lessons now and after playing this video recently, I'd have to say Joe Carr's teaching is somewhat unclear. You can't even see everything he's playing. I wouldn't recommend this for a beginner whose just starting. I think I lost interest in guitar because of these lessons.",1295654400,,394,4.642857142857143
