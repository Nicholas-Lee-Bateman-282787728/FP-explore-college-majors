8180441,4,B000NP3JAU,"The BBC documentary series, Religions of the World, is a fourteen-part series meant to introduce viewers not only to the six major world religions---Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism.
 While I enjoyed all of the episodes, one thing I found odd about this series is that when I had read about it online, it was listed as having FOURTEEN episodes which covered not just the five major religions---Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism---but also several other religious traditions, namely the broad category of indigenous Japanese religions known as Shinto, Confucianism, Taoism, Religions of Small Societies (whatever that means), Ancient Religions of the Mediterranean, African and African-American religions, Native American religions, and finally, Atheism, Skepticism and other forms of nonbelief---yet those episodes are not there. I found that really, really odd, irritating, perplexing and disappointing. Also, the episode on Hinduism, which I had watched on YouTube, was two hours and fifty minutes---yet on this version it is only fifty-five minutes. My suspicion is that, much as with feature films, when the people who made this series were making it, they made a so-called international version, which had all fourteen episodes and which had the ENTIRE two-hour-and-fifty-one-minute Hinduism episode (as opposed to the significantly shorter, fifty-five-minute American version), and that, unlike the original international version, this so-called American version only focuses on Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism, while the international version had many more episodes on other religious traditions as well. I call it the ""American"" version because I suspect that when it was originally broadcast in the UK, as well as when it was originally released internationally, the version available outside of the U.S. probably has the ENTIRE 14-episode series, including ALL two hours and fifty-one minutes of the original Hinduism episode, while---for some bizarre reason---the distributor assumed that Americans would not be as interested in the topic and therefore felt the need to shorten the Hinduism episode to fifty-one minutes and to shorten the series itself to only five episodes (as opposed to the original fourteen episodes).
Thus, while this particular series is a mere 5  hours (300 mins.), had the entire series been available on Amazon, based on my own calculations of the actual length of the entire series---and that includes the entire two hours and fifty-one minutes of the Hinduism documentary in what I suspect is the international version of the documentary (as opposed to its significantly abridged American release, in which the Hinduism episode is only fifty-five minutes and which only has five episodes as opposed to all fourteen episodes included in the original series)---the entire series would have been 985 minutes long---that is to say, 16 hours and 25 minutes. In addition to the world's MAJOR religions (i.e. Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), I was under the impression that the series would contain the other eight episodes---namely the ones on the Shinto religion of Japan, Native American Religions, African and African-American religions, Confucianism and Taoism, one GENERAL episode on Christianity (not just Protestantism, Catholicism and Orthodox Christianity), Religions of Small Societies (whatever that means), and also on Atheism, Skepticism, and other forms of nonbelief. I also think it was odd that they left out the various movements intending to revive ancient religions (e.g. Greco-Roman, Viking, Germanic, Celtic, etc) broadly called Neo-Paganism. It would have been interesting had they chosen to to explore those religions as well.
 When discussing the Spanish Inquisition, the makers of this documentary got something wrong when they claimed that the last Jews were expelled in 1492. This is a common mistake made by many non-Muslim and non-Spanish historians. I suspect that the reason for this is because it coincides with Christopher Columbus' voyage to the New World, and is therefore easy to remember---regardless of the fact that it took a couple hundred years to expel all the Muslims and Jews completely.  In actual fact, it took Spain 297 years to expel the Jews. All of the Jews who refused to convert to Christianity (or who were merely suspected of secretly practicing Judaism) were all kicked out of Spain by 1789. Furthermore, it took 138 years to expel the Muslims. All Muslims were expelled from Spain by 1630. It is interesting to note that in 2013, the Spanish parliament passed a law saying that any Jew who can prove, through either documentation and/or DNA, that they are in some way descended from some of the Jews who had been expelled from 1492-1789, can become a Spanish citizen if he or she wishes. When talking about the population of Indonesia---the country with the worlds largest Muslim population---Mr. Kingsley inaccurately states that Indonesia has 100 million Muslims, when in reality, there are around 270 million Muslims in Indonesia. (Then again, that very well may have been Indonesias Muslim population in 1998 when this movie was made, although I am not really sure whether that was true or not). When discussing Ramadan, he forgot to mention that in addition to refraining from food and drink, a Muslim also cannot have sex during the day either. When discussing Buddhism, the documentary claimed---inaccurately---that the Dalai Lama, the documentary claimed---inaccurately---that the Dalai Lama was seen as a ""God King."" Buddhists---whether Tibetan or otherwise---revere the Dalai Lama, but they do NOT worship him. Some Buddhists often choose to worshi Hindu gods, as well as the Buddha, and many Hindus consider the Buddha to be an avatar of Vishnu (the Hindu god of preservation), but---no---as far as I know, there is NO EVIDENCE to suggest that the Buddhists worship the Dalai Lama. I also thought it was odd how many of the episodes ended abruptly, often in the middle of discussing a particular aspect of the religion on which the particular episode focused, and this often would happen just when I was getting into them and expecting there to be more information. The only exception to this rule was the episode on Islam. In spite of these flaws, and despite the fact that I will have to look elsewhere for the ENTIRE series, this series was good, nonetheless.",1507334400,,6444,5.383548067393459
8180442,5,B000NP3JAU,"Very nicely done.  A good combination of details of a religion and what its culture is like.  I work at an international seminary where the students are seldom exposed to anything outside Christianity.  These DVDs helped make the Muslims, Jews etc. real people to them.  Since they are English as Second Language speakers the visuals (and ability to get English subtitles) was very helpful.  For my setting I would have liked to have skipped the DVDs on Christianity and added in more other religions, but I guess that would be a different collection.",1454630400,,551,4.881720430107527
8180443,4,B000NP3JAU,"Some other reviewers sound as if they are reviewing a different video. These are 55-minute videos, not animated, not suitable for younger grades -- really only for 11th and 12th grades and college. I have used them for several in college-level comp. religion courses. They are very well done. My only comment is that they are  very condensed -- probably too much information to show at a single viewing. I show them in segments, with commentary or discussion on each segment. They are not animated videos, but offer the sights and sounds of religions that don't come from reading a textbook.",1412208000,2,591,4.851485148514851
8180444,2,B000NP3JAU,Too wordy and really dull my students fell asleep. Sound information but just dated and ponderous. Needs an update and more interesting slant on each religion,1369094400,3,158,5.115384615384615
8180445,5,B000NP3JAU,This is an excellent resource for the classroom-as added curriculum to be used in conjunction with classroom lectures-highly recommend this product.,1355875200,2,148,6.095238095238095
8180446,4,B000NP3JAU,"Kingley's videos are a good survey of world religions for the middle school or high School level. They are not highly informative and not comprehensive or comparative. But are good, well produced and solid in the information they contain. They are the best available for the middle school level instruction.",1312156800,5,307,5.16
8180447,4,B000NP3JAU,"This video is part of the ""Religions of the World"" series.  You do not have to see the other videos for this one to make sense.  Most of the footage is collected from historical pictures and in Asia, but the interviews with authorities are primarily here in the US.
This film has more historical reporting than philosophical discussion, with the authorities helping the viewer to understand the significance of the historical.  This is about the right mix to make the video interesting for a class. It does cover many of the different schools.  One of the authorities is a Zen Buddhist who tries to help the viewer understand some of the intricacies of Buddhism.
This is not a film to watch as an introduction to Buddhism.  It is best to be familiar with some of the key terms and figures before viewing.  Also, I found that the narrator's pronunciation of some terms was almost completely different from mine.  This did lead to some confused moments, but nothing that would detract from the video.
I would recommend this video for educators and students wanting to understand a bit more about Buddhism.",1015718400,11,1103,4.773684210526316
