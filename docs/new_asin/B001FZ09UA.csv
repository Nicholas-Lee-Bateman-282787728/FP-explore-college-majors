8303135,5,B001FZ09UA,"It's amazing how one can learn the Scriptures in different ways, different style. I'm not a big fan of hip-hop music however, I have to say that this is one of those times where I don't really get bored listening in. A friend of mine ran a study group with a bunch of teenagers using this curriculum. I was surprised to see the turnout, better yet, hear their responses during the discussion. Lecrae and his team did an outstanding job in making the Scriptures ""appealing"" to many. Realistically, most teenagers and especially unbelievers would not give the time of day to hear the Word of truth, but this curriculum makes the New Testament available to such a group. Thanks for yielding to God and His guidance.",1313798400,5,712,4.658730158730159
