883855,4,6304460260,"Castle Keep is a very good war movie with an excellent storyline that is a little different from other war movies.  The story takes place in the Ardennes during WWII in the Battle of the Bulge.  Eight walking wounded misfit Americans discover a castle whose count offers to let them stay there.  The Americans must decide whether to stay and delay the Germans at the risk of destroying the beauty of the castle or just turning around and running for their own lines.
 This movie boasts an excellent cast that includes Burt Lancaster, Peter Falk, Jean-Pierre Aumont, Tony Bill, Patrick O'Neal, and Bruce Dern.  Lancaster gives another great performance as Major Falconer, the leader of the group.  O'Neal is also very good as Captain Beckman, an art historian who wants to abandon the castle so it won't be destroyed by the advancing Germans.  Another interesting performance is by Peter Falk as Sergeant Rossi, who disappears into the nearby town and becomes their baker.  This movie has some anti-war messages, but at other times it is very funny.  I hadn't heard of this movie before I saw it on TV, but it is very good.  Well developed characters, good action, some humor, and an interesting if sometime out of place musical score.  Either way this is a movie that is well worth watching.",1051920000,19,1291,4.77027027027027
883856,4,6304460260,"Like ""Moby Dick"", an allegorical tale suffers when it is translated to a visual medium; yet this film DOES capture the surrealism of war that author William Eastlake must have found intriguing.  But an ""anti-war"" film?  In my opinion is has nothing to do with pro OR anti-war...it is an examination of what people stand for; in this movie the choice is between pricelss artworks kept in the castle, and the priceless value of humantiy.  How each soldier makes his choice is what this movie examines.  An allegorical tale that asks you to make your own decision about what matters the most to YOU.  (and the book is even better!)",1050537600,4,628,4.672727272727273
883857,5,6304460260,"How existential do you want to get in describing this story? Passions during war? Lancaster gives one his best performances -- but then again, when was he bad? I'd say if you're interested in this movie check out his ""Swimmer"" movie. I'd like to see Castle Keep on DVD - including the director's comments on the making of this film. Also, when this movie came out I remember seeing Lancaster defending it on - I believe, on the Dick Cavett Show - as a anti-war film. This would be great to include on a DVD.",1030665600,7,507,4.347368421052631

At times surreal, bitterly ironic and bitterly funny. It takes place during the Battle of the Bulge, as ""8 walking wounded misfits of the American Army"" try to hold a castle against the advancing German Army.

883859,3,6304460260,"Another of the bizarre World War Two movies to have been filmed in Yugoslavia. The film hosts quite an impressive cast attached to a very strange story.

CASTLE KEEP opens as two jeep-loads of Army rejects billet themselves in a castle. The lord of the castle is willing to pander to any army as long as his castle survives unscathed. Unfortunately the Germans are about to launch their 1944 Ardennes Offensive and the castle is smack in the path of the Nazi advance.

If the German attack was the only problem then there would not be much of a story. To complicate matters the lady of the castle picks Burt Lancaster's character to father a successor to the ownership of the castle, Peter Falk wanders into town to become a baker, a soldier falls in love with an abandoned Volkswagen, and Bruce Dern leads an oddball assortment of deserters on a holy crusade. Additionally, the soundtrack is a bit out of place and sounds very similar to that of BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID.

The final German Siege of the castle almost makes up for the surreal first two thirds of the film.  One wonders why anyone would want to keep this castle.  Still, the battle sequences look great on wide-screen DVD.",1014508800,2,1198,4.605633802816901

The Germans have broken through Allied lines near  the castle,and battered American troops are rapidly retreating. Do Burt and  his men also retreat and leave the castle and its treasures to the  advancing Germans? Excellent verbal exchanges among the American soldiers  and truly explosive combat sequences interwoven with touches of romance and  art make this more than a ""men only"" movie.

883995,5,6304460260,"This movie was a family favorite in my house growing up with two brothers.  With great actors (Burt Lancaster as the dominant Major, Peter Falk, Michael Conrad & Patrick O'Neal among the enlisted men), a beautiful girl (the obscure former model Astrid Heeren), fabulous scenery of wintry Belgium (mostly filmed in Yugoslavia), a lovely medieval castle, plenty of rat-a-tat machine gun fire and a powerhouse ending, we watched this again & again whenever it was shown on TV and never got tired of it.  Remember that Sydney Pollack (The Way We Were) directed and Martin Ransohoff (The Sandpiper) produced it, with such mega talent it was a shame it flopped at the box office because audiences didn't get it.  Know what, you aren't supposed to fully understand it, the story by William Eastlake (great book still reissued and sold in updated versions here on Amazon) was deliberately poetic and evocative, and the movie was completely faithful to it.  The count of the castle, played by another classic film star Jean Pierre Aumont, allows his wife to sleep with Lancaster as he is impotent and wants an heir - O'Neal confronts Lancaster who says, ""don't judge her, she's not a work of art"" (O'Neal's character being an art historian).  The whole film moves at a suspended pace, and it's very moving on an emotional level - this is a suicide mission, eight GI's billeted at this castle with tons of heavily armed Germans eventually attacking out of the Ardennes Forest and no reinforcements coming - in that respect, it paralleled the bravery of the Allied soldiers at the Battle of the Bulge.  But in Lancaster's words, don't judge it, just sit back and appreciate it as an offbeat art film that has a great ending of non-stop action & a bravura late career performance by Burt Lancaster.",1470268800,5,1786,4.8202614379084965

884004,4,6304460260,"For a squad of eight weary, self-proclaimed misfit G.I.'s stumbling onto on almost magical untouched ancient Belgium castle late in WWII, it seemed like a perfect place to sidestep the rest of the hostilities. Days after settling in, though, comes a very disturbing realization: the desperate monster push the Germans have mounted (remembered today for triggering the Battle of the Bulge) is headed right for them.

You figure, what goes around comes around like it or not, a theme two other contemporary movies handled better, ""Shenandoah"" (1965) and ""Garden Of The Finzi-Continis"" (1970). The problem with this production is, it takes forever to address the attack--virtually half the film. Much of the first fifty minutes is a strange, even surrealistic idyll. And rarely do you see so much dramatic underplaying, starting with squad leader Maj. Falconer/Burt Lancaster and running down through the five nco's, chief among them Sgt. Rossi/Peter Falk. Whether they were supposed to be cool, valorous veterans, or merely mellowed out on marijuana, I'm unclear. And that soundtrack music? I don't wanna go there again.

Fortunately, everything gets rolling when the Germans arrive; I don't think I've ever been so happy to see them in a war film. The subsequent battle scenes--first in the nearby town, later at the castle--are beautifully filmed, maybe better than ""The Dirty Dozen"". They're worth sitting through or fast forwarding past the freaky preliminaries, which contributed greatly to an abysmal box office back in the day. But for the more tolerant/patient war movie fans among us now, ""Castle"" has its plusses. 3 1/2 stars for those.",1433894400,,1644,5.247148288973384

While one can easily interpret much of what happens as a metaphor for what can happen in wartime, the treatment is never heavy-handed or obvious.

884143,5,6304460260,"This strikes me as one of those ""experimental"" films that was made during the Vietnam war to try desperately to get the average joe to realize how crazy war could be. I very much appreciate experimental films when they are done well. This was done well for its time, but took great risks and was probably fated to do poorly at the box office. It is rather surrealistic in many ways and full of nice small surprises. Sprinkled with words to ponder. Can't call it generic!!

Someday film historians may draw special attention to this film as a war film.

Right now it seems dated to me, thinking as a general audience person. If however you are into film making you may better appreciate all the little clever embellishments.

I thought for awhile that the Burt Lancaster character was going to be cardboard simple, but on reflection he was more ambiguous as were always his objectives in defending the castle so there is ""stuff to talk over"" after the film other than just the experimental filmmaking.

Why set up defences in the castle if that would lead to the destruction of its art treasures? Why make it into a battle site and even draw the attention of German troops to it? Aren't we supposedly fighting to save civilization?",1358899200,,1230,4.628440366972477

This is a war movie that can't decide whether it's coming or going. The plot - if it even exists - asks more questions than it can answer.  If you are one of those war buffs, you will get enough to whet your appetite. There are explosive firefights and a little humor on the side with the fire-bombing whores and a band of anti-war (""we're conscientious objectors - we don't believe in fighting"") led by the irrepressible Bruce Dern.

884145,3,6304460260,"I hadn't realized until seeing the Amazon listing that this was filmed so early in Sidney Pollock's career. He was far too good a director to have turned out such a turkey in his mature days. If there is any kind of political message (Pollack's specialty) here it is well hidden beneath the literary veneer. That veneer is the death of the movie since it motivates much of the inane dialogue. The very important problem faced in every war we (and other liberal democratic nations) have fought is the extent to which, morally, we can sacrifice irreplaceable cultural monuments to achieving military objectives while limiting the number of dead and injured soldiers (and, sometimes, civilians). The question is raised in the film but buried in the detritus of a misguided film and its all-too-literary dialog.
Burt Lancaster comes closest to salvaging a role from the chit-chat more fitting to amateur night at a Village coffee-house of the period. I suppose he drew on his many fine performances to bring some air of authority  to his part. None of the others had that good luck, with even Peter Falk too handicapped to make any sense out of his role. Oh, yes, there is an attractive young woman who has the good fortune to be relieved of all acting chores while looking good.
For my part this has no more to do with World War 2 than  it has to do with the Korean or Vietnamese Wars (or the American Revolution or Civil War). I do understand that it is sufficiently meaningless to allow almost anything to be read into it. My advice would be to watch it only as an historian of the American Cinema or a student of the post-war (WW2)films about the war. Secondarily, it can be watched as a lesson in how a fine actor survives while all about him are biting the dust. Posthumous sympathy can be offered to Sidney Pollock for having to do this film in order to be given the chance at the outstanding career he had in front of him.

The battle fought by a group of titans lead by Burt Lancaster provide a dream sequence among the many nightmares of WWII. It is worth watching again and again. Fresh and crisp dialogue, beautiful photography, a joy from begining to end. Flawless.

Caveat: For those that buy thinking that everything goes well in Amazon universe, please beware. I bought the widescreen copy of the DVD only to find out that now I own two copies of the fullscreen version. Nice! The merchant said that it was a problem with the bar code, but the question now is, does the widescreen version of the movie truly exists, because the movie is beautiful in any shape, or is it just a glitch in the system?

""Oh,"" Falk responds, ""who believes in fighting?""  The soldier, who a moment before had been leading a handful of soldiers singing for redemption, responds that ""We believe in God.  That frightens you doesn't it?  All you believe in is fornication and killing.  We're conscientious objectors,"" the soldier (played by Bruce Dern) tells Falk, in conclusion.  Patrick O'Neil's character is an objector in a way too.  He plays a ""famed art historian"" turned fighting subordinate who tries to persuade Burt Lancaster to abandon the castle they are holed up in rather than see it destroyed should they try to hold it against advancing Germans.  He tells Lancaster, his one-eyed commander (a man who apparently can't see the forest for the trees, or so it seems to be suggested) that ""If something isn't saved, what's it all for?""  Lancaster, whose name herein is Falconer, continuing on this theme,  objects by saying that ""You can't save anything by giving it to the Germans.  If you give them anything you have to give them everything.""

All this, mind you, takes place in Belgium at ""a tenth century castle in a twentieth century war,"" as the film trailer states.  The characters herein likewise are rather oddly situated.  We have the art historian in a historic castle filled to the rafters with priceless art; the one-eyed commander determined to hold the fort, as they say; a preacher (not the singing guy above who was from another unit), who berates a German tank with words until it is simply too close not to be fired upon; a would-be writer who is trying to absorb all that is happening around him; a cowboy of sorts, who takes a liking to a Volkswagon Beetle Bug car and spends an inordinate amount of his free time polishing it and driving it in circles in front of the castle; and we have Peter Falk's character, a baker turned soldier---the most alive character in the film, the most watchable actor herein---who, almost just to make him as odd as some of the others, winds up helping the local baker's wife (whose husband is presumably dead) literally make bread.  Falk:  ""I've got no place to go, no place to retreat to.""  The words could just have easily been spoken by Lancaster's character, of course.  Hence the latter's determination to stand his ground.  Is this a wonderful picture?  That should be easy enough for you to answer from just this sketch I've provided you with, but as you can project a bit of your own thinking into this film,  you can argue (as others have here) that this film has more depth than one might at first glance see.  That depends more on you than anything else, of course, so I'll leave it at that and give Castle Keep a rather neutral three stars and leave it to you to decide whether to have a gander at this film.

884222,2,6304460260,"Two World War II flicks involving a European castle came out in 1968, ""Where Eagles Dare"" and ""Castle Keep."" If you're a fan of war films you've no doubt heard of ""Where Eagles Dare,"" which is one of the greatest war action/adventure films ever made; but I wouldn't be too surprised if you've never heard of ""Castle Keep"" or only vaguely heard of it. There's good reason for this.

THE PLOT: The Germans are marching on a Belgium village in the Ardennes where a small group of American soldiers make a stand at a 10th century castle.

""Castle Keep"" has a lot going for it: a great cast, including Burt Lancaster, Peter Falk, Bruce Dern & many more; fabulous Yugoslavian Winter locations & castle; thrilling action scenes; it's well-made on a technical level; and it hardly comes across dated at all, even though it's forty years old. Fans of the film describe it as ""poetic"" & ""haunting""  and it's certainly obvious the filmmakers were shooting for something groundbreaking, meaningful and artistic.

Unfortunately ""Castle Keep"" failed to grab my attention until well into the second half of its 1 hour & 45 minute runtime, which is when the great action scenes start. The characters have a lot of dialogue but you never get to know them or care about them. Maybe because the chatter comes off as unreal, artsy and inscutable. Want a sample? The Count of the castle comments to Theresa (who is his wife, I think), ""They planned this war because there was something they hadn't yet smashed."" She replies, ""Who are we, Henri?"" ""We are the keepers."" [Thanks to Amazon reviewer Steven Hellerstedt for citing this dialogue].

The script is full of such ""deep"" nonsense. Which I suppose would be okay as long as the story itself pulled me in, but it didn't. The story doesn't perk up and grab the viewer's attention until the Germans march on the village well past the hour mark.

Want another example of the film's ""unreal"" vibe? The soldiers go into town to kill time at the local whore house. When they enter all the prostitutes are standing or lying around in various tantalizing poses in lingerie. I'm sure they were just hanging around like that waiting for five soldiers to walk in -- WHY SURE! You gotta see it to believe it. I busted out laughing!

One reviewer offered the interpretation that one soldier, the writer, is simply remembering how it was, not how it really was, and that's why it comes across so dreamlike, bizarre and unreal. I find this a valid explanation. Others point out that it's an allegory about the futility of the Vietnam War which was going on at the time of release. Another interpretation is that the message is one of contrast: Life from death, and death where once life was (Huh?).

Hey, I'm all for ""message"" films with deeper meanings, that is, as long as the film itself is interesting; the original ""Apocalypse Now"" is a good example. The greatest sin in filmmaking is to be boring. The second is to be pretentious. Unfortunately ""Castle Keep"" commits both of these transgressions IMHO.

BOTTOM LINE: ""Castle Keep"" is an avant-garde film palatable to a chosen few. It's either groundbreaking or pretentious depending on your tastes. I certainly respect it and enjoy numerous aspects noted above, but personally deem it a failure. Still, I'm an open-minded person. Maybe next time I'll ""get it.""

If my words intrigue you, check it out. I strangely found it worth viewing (and owning) even though I currently don't like it. I can't figure it out but, then again, I can't figure the film out either.",1196121600,3,3534,4.741042345276873
884223,1,6304460260,"And I thought `Catch-22' was the worst WWII movie ever made.

 At least the source of that one - Joseph Heller's best selling novel - is funny and brilliant.  Maybe William Eastlake's CASTLE KEEP is a great novel, too.  I'll never know, and after watching director Sydney Pollack's take on it I'm none to anxious to hunt it down. A group of American soldiers, led by eye patched Major Abraham Falconer (Burt Lancaster) decamp in a medieval castle that stands between the advancing Germans and Bastogne. The castle is the residence of the Count of Malorais and Therese, a winsome lass with a wandering eye, and contains a Louvre's worth of art.

 Having established a promising plot the movie promptly abandons it and spends nine-tenths of its remaining time standing around talking.  Oh, Major Burt makes a heavy move on Therese, Captain Patrick O'Neal moons over the art, the enlisted men spend some time in a cat house in town and, inexplicably, Sergeant Peter Falk takes up residence with a widowed baker's wife.  And wild-eyed Bruce Dern, with choir, pops into the movie every now and then as a hymn singing conscientious objector.  But most of the time it's just tedious, pretentious, impenetrable talk.  For instance, at one point Therese and the Count share this exchange - ""They planned this war because there was something they hadn't yet smashed."" ""Who are we, Henri?"" ""We are the keepers.""

 I think CASTLE KEEP is supposed to be a serio-comic response to Vietnam, but this absurd depiction of the futility of war is subverted by its ponderous arrogance and leaden pacing.  Static and deathly boring.",1144627200,10,1611,4.8786764705882355
884224,5,6304460260,"If you're expecting a traditional WWII action film, you may well be puzzled or put off by this film, which completely upends the idea of traditional heroism ... yet without disparaging it, either, which is no mean feat. Clearly an allegorical, symbolic film that speaks to Vietnam as much as to WWII, deliberately & gleefully anachronistic, it remains timely to this day. As long as there are wars, the absurdity, black humor, destruction & loss depicted here will remain relevant. In a way, it revises a notable statement from Vietnam & asks, ""Will it become necessary to destroy civilization in order to save it?""

It's a visually stunning film, thankfully released in widescreen at last, which it needs & deserves. There's a fairy tale quality to many of the shots, accentuated by the then-contemporary pop music soundtrack by Michel Legrand, very Swingle Singers at times, always haunting. Yet other scenes have a bold, garishly surreal quality to them. And the battle scenes are brutally realistic & bloody, a harsh & effective counterpoint to the earlier fairy tale quality.

The ensemble cast is wonderful, with Burt Lancaster rightfully leading the pack. He's a stolid, realistic, undeniably brave man -- and short-sighted for that very reason, seeing only the mission, willing to sacrifice everything to fulfill it. Yet what other sort of man would be able to go on fighting an implacable enemy? That's one of the things I especially like about this film: it asks difficult questions & doesn't take the easy way out by unfairly demonizing one viewpoint.

The rest of the cast is equally good, from Al Freeman's Ishmael-like novelist (""And I alone am escaped to tell thee""), to Patrick O'Neal's tortured, sensitive art historian, so desperate to preserve the endangered beauties of the castle, to Peter Falk's earthy sergeant, who would rather bake bread (the staff of life) rather than bring more death to the world. Yet in the end, death will inevitably overtake all but one of them.

The script is a writer's delight, filled with dark jokes, poignant reveries, wicked one-liners. It's a literate script, from a more literate time, and well worth hearing more than once. Again, this is a film that's meant to be fully experienced in the viewing & then thought about & discussed at length afterwards. It's a welcome addition to the film collection of any discerning viewer. Most highly recommended!",1140652800,9,2407,5.025062656641604

Some of the dialogue is outright funny and also ironic, but the movie is not played strictly for laughs. Indeed, the ending is both bleak and disheartening, but the action is relentless, uncompromising, and very violent.

I thought about the movie after it had ended, and wanted to watch it again. This is a movie that bears repeat viewings. Taken in its context of being released in 1969, the parallels to the futility of the Vietnam War are unmistakeable. As powerful an anti-war movie as PATHS OF GLORY and GO TELL THE SPARTANS (also starring Burt Lancaster...where's the DVD?), it is also a compelling adventure story filled with great perfomances (Burt Lancaster, Patrick O'Neal, and especially Peter Falk as a sergeant turned... baker!) and witty black humor tinged with non-sequitors and one-liners.

884294,5,6304460260,"Burt Lancaster as you haven't seen him before. Splendid Peter Falk, Bruce Dern and Patrick O'Neal complete the palette of a varied cast.

This is not a true war movie as many may think.

It is a poetic and tragic vision about the war.

Taking place during the last year of World War II, in the Ardennes (in Belgium) in the winter of 1944/45, the entire world seems to concentrate and gather in one small spot on the world map.

A magic castle in a wonderful estate (thanks to a marvellous photography).

Everything happens. People settling down in the castle, others in the nearby village, some even taking over the business. Moreover, there is betrayal and loyalty put on the line...

A sleepy village and castle simply come to life in the most tragic of moments in WWII.

A contrast. Life from Death, and Death were once Life was.

Do I need to spell it out for you?

Watch it. This is a true ""message"" movie, but not preachy at that, as some may think.

If you appreciated ""Slaughterhouse Five"", this film will truly please you.

Lancaster plays a consumed soldier, a commander, disillusioned by life, almost cynical, who later on proves that sacrifice is not a useless word.

I can only recommend it.

This one is for thinking people only.

""Castle Keep"" stand on a par with the said ""Slaughterhouse Five"", together with other masterpieces such as ""When Trumpets Fade"" and ""A Midnight Clear"".

You won't find better movies than this one in this genre.",1080172800,6,1455,4.62890625
884295,5,6304460260,"As I saw this film and  Midnight Clear again recently, I thought about Stanley Weintraub's book Silent Night in which he discusses a brief period prior to Christmas in 1914, on the battlefields of Flanders, when German and British soldiers spontaneously agreed to declare a truce and suspend fighting, thereby defying their commanding officers. Centuries ago, knights and their attendants would work with their enemies to clear a field for combat the next day. Such cooperation had an obvious practical value. That's not what interests Weintraub as he examines a temporary truce during one of the bloodiest wars ever fought. It had little (if any) practical or tactical value but it did (and does) suggest a human need which transcends military obligations. However, war is war. After a brief respite, the carnage inevitably resumes.
Directed by Sydney Pollack and based on William Eastlake's novel, it stars Burt Lancaster (Major Abraham Falconer), Patrick O'Neal (as Captain Lionel Beckman), and Peter Falk (as Sergeant Orlando Rossi). They and their five associates are in Belgium during the winter of 1944 when they seek some R&R in the 10th century castle of Count Henri Tixier and his wife, Countess Therese. The Count is impotent and desperate for his wife to produce a male heir. Falconer is an obvious candidate to help the Count achieve his objective. Meanwhile, the war in Europe continues, of course, but the castle keeps them safe from its dangers and deprivations.
While seeing this film the first time and then again recently, I felt as if I were dreaming that I had returned to the 1940s in a time machine, to Belgium near the end of World War Two. Credit Henri Decae's cinematography with creating an uncommonly beautiful setting within which savage combat eventually occurs, reminiscent of John Mathieson's visually stunning camera work during the ""Hell Unleashed"" sequence early in Gladiator. This is a haunting film, at times an exquisitely lovely film. Certain scenes caused me to think that I was hallucinating.
It now occurs to me that perhaps (just perhaps) Castle Keep portrays a group of men at war, not as they really were nor as war really was at a given time but as those men would remember it decades later, had all of them survived and eventually shared their memories of the castle and surrounding area. That is about as close as I have come (thus far) to understanding certain surrealistic moments in the film. Castle Keep deserves more attention than it has received.
Hopefully it will soon be available in DVD format, accompanied by special features will include as much discussion of it as is already available or can be generated. I fondly recall the ""Movies in Time"" series on the History cable television channel, hosted by Sander Vanocur, which featured films such as Saving Private Ryan. Before, during, and then following each screening, Vanocur and his guests would discuss the film. How much I wish there were a recorded interview out there, somewhere, during which Pollack, Decae, Lancaster, Falk, and others associated with Castle Keep share their thoughts and feelings about its meaning and significance.",1079913600,28,3151,5.059615384615385

7871917,5,6304460260,"This is not a war movie. If you're looking for just a war movie, go watch one of those. This is something else again.

There's a reason why a group of great directors like Martin Scorsese, Stephen Spielberg & others got together to make sure this movie was flawlessly restored & remastered. It was because they recognized it as Sidney Pollack's masterpiece.

The story takes place in and around a castle, a real castle (or is it a fantasy castle?) to which a small band of weary, ragtag American soldiers wanders during the pivotal Battle Of The Bulge, which was fought in and around the little crossroads town of Bastogne in Belgium, 1944. That much of the story is real, alright. The Battle of The Bulge was one of the most terrible battles of WW2.

Made in 1969, as the peace movement was shifting into high gear against Richard Nixon's massive escalation of the Vietnam War, Castle Keep struck a chord with American youth weary of the war, the draft, the endless stream of body bags & wounded soldiers, with no end to it in sight. It seemed like everyone knew someone who who had been killed or wounded or otherwise injured by the war, the war that was getting harder and harder to explain, let alone justify.

I was in the Navy then, stationed in the Philippines at a communications center that relayed message traffic between Saigon & Pearl harbor. Most of it had to do with the war. Much of it was classified and most of it was appalling. When I had enlisted, I questioned the war, but I wanted to serve my country. But after a year of reading classified information about what was REALLY going on there, it was very clear to me that the war was pointless and indefensible. As one general said at the time, ""There was nothing to win and no way to win it.""

Like so many of my friends, I became disillusioned and conflicted about the war, especially since it was inevitable that I would end up in Nam at some point & that I would have to participate in that terrible, pointless destruction & waste of human life. It was at once infuriating & depressing. The world seemed increasingly unreal and descending into madness. Sure enough, my next duty station was on a river patrol boat in the Mei Kong Delta. But that's another story.

Fortunately, the Navy base where I was stationed showed first-run movies for free at the outdoor basketball court at night. My friends and I went there to escape the insanity of the war & spend a few hours watching movies. Ironically, it was there that we saw great antiwar films like M*A*S*H, The kIng Of Hearts, Greetings, Hail Hero, Catch 22, The Madwoman Of Challot, Castle Keep and others that captured the dark absurdity & the giddy helpless plunge toward death & destruction that one feels in a war. They all helped me get through that time.

But my favorite was Castle Keep. At first it seemed like just an offbeat war movie. But as the story unfolded it beautifully evoked the bizarre, dreamlike craziness that one experiences during wartime. It is based on the book of the same title by William Eastlake, which I read and liked, but this is that rare case where the movie is even better than the book.

I won't bore you with the plot, since the plot is just the stage on which the characters strut and fret, full of sound and fury. Only in this case, they signify much. There is real art here; real magic, That is, if you have a taste for art & magic.

The production values are very high, a feast of the eyes. The cast is wonderful. The acting superb. Lancaster was never better. He speaks his lines gracefully, as if reciting Shakespeare; with the resigned gravitas of a weary warrior who cannot stop what he knows is coming. Pollack's direction is brilliant. The photography is stunning. The music is perfectly dreamlike, melancholy, ethereal. The special effects are great, but more artistic than merely exciting (no tacky CGI green-screen crap here). The script is literary without being self-consciously so. The sets, especially the castle itself, are fantastic. Literally. It was filmed on location at a real castle in Europe (I forget where).

But this is a case where the whole is far more than the sum of the parts.

So like I said, if you're looking for just another war movie, pass on this. But if you're up for a magical, allegorical, surreal antiwar film, look no further.",1506211200,2,4333,4.578064516129032
