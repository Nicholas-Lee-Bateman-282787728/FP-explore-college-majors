8358604,4,B0029YQEXW,"Great video.  Graphics are dated and voice over is a bit hokey, but appreciated.  Amazing views of areas that are built over now.  Views of Montclair and Rockridge are especially surprising.  Wish there was more of the Sacramento Northern on here, but it leaves more room for another DVD.  Great work.",1400371200,,301,4.823529411764706
