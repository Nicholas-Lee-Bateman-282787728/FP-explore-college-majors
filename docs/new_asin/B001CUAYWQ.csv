8289581,5,B001CUAYWQ,Watched this on tv because I was the offspring of someone in SAC and wanted to know more. My DVR is dying so I wanted my own copy that would not disappear when DVR is replaced.,1505865600,,176,3.9166666666666665
8289582,5,B001CUAYWQ,"A bit positive but accurate as to the way it was viewed, back then.  Not much mention of the possibly-world-ending Broken Arrow accidents.  But we can see how the SAC was born, and later died.  People were there.  Nukes were dropped but did not detonate as H-bombs, thank God.  Read other books on Broken Arrows, if you want to have nightmares.",1433808000,,344,4.573770491803279
8289583,4,B001CUAYWQ,This was a gift and the recipient was thrilled with it.  He has watched it already and will again soon I'm sure.,1390348800,,112,4.090909090909091
8289584,5,B001CUAYWQ,"As a child I remember reading about the DEW line of radar stations ringing the north pole, DEW Distant Early Warning and then learning about SAC, Strategic Air Command and how we had plains in the air 24-7.  History Chanel hit it out of the park!",1388448000,4,246,4.3478260869565215
