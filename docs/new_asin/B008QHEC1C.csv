8529567,5,B008QHEC1C,"I originally tried this workout back in 2005 when it was released.  I enjoyed it, but it was rather easy for me so I dismissed it.  I knew full well that it was geared towards exercisers age 35 and up, I was approaching that age at the time but not quite there yet.

Fast forward to today where I am now in my early 40's and I thoroughly appreciate this workout much more.  I tend to migrate more towards workouts that are age appropriate for me.  While I still like to lift weights, they aren't as heavy as they used to be and I am over the endless lower body sets that are often visible in so many videos.  I want to maintain my fitness level, but I also fully realize that I am not as young as I used to be.

Heidi Tanner leads this workout, who led one of my all time favorite Firm workouts, Firm Cardio.  We didn't see her in any other workouts by the Firm but she led a few for the Fitprime and WHFN.  Her experience really shows here and she is very pleasant and encouraging throughout. All the muscle groups are hit well, there are some props that are used also.  You will see the tall box and dowel.  I use my high step and sculpting stick in place of those.  A yoga block is also used, I just do the workout without it as I no longer have one.

You have your standard weight work here, along with some cardio tunes but there is also a yoga/pilates feel to it as well in the way of stretching and core work.  I think it's a nice change personally.  I used moderate to heavy weights for the most part, with some light ones as well when deemed appropriate.  The music and scenery are great, the colors are very vibrant and fresh.  And while this workout has a definite Firm feel, it seems a little more relaxed.  As much as I have liked the Firm over the years, I would tend to agree with those who felt the presentation was a little stiff and scripted.  I always overlooked that because I enjoyed the workouts so well and were effective for me.

Overall, I give this workout 4 and half stars.  It's a definite keeper for me and one I will go to for years to come.",1451692800,,2071,4.114713216957606
