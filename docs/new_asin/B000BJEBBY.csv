8087474,5,B000BJEBBY,"Great if you're a Roxy Music completist or even if you haven't seen them live. Keep in mind a bit of crazy 1970s ""new wave"" costuming is to be expected and just enjoy!",1447113600,,167,4.090909090909091
8087475,5,B000BJEBBY,I did not notice that is was on PAL and not NTSC but it plays perfectly in my laptop.  (I worked for Roxy on the Manifesto Tour and this was on the last leg of a world tour.  One of their best tours and this was one of the best shows on it!),1427241600,,241,3.5283018867924527
8087476,5,B000BJEBBY,I don't know why this recording isn't better known because it's terrific. I bought it a couple of years ago second hand and thought it was a bootleg as I didn't even see it listed here on Amazon. The quality is first rate by my standards and the performances exceptional. I also have Live at the Apollo and rate this higher (by far).,1300579200,3,333,4.301587301587301
