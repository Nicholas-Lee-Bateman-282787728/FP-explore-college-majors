5972995,5,B00FA9CIKQ,"After series after series that draw their dramatic energy from mayhem, death and terror, a show about life, in all its messy glory.  I love how this series features so many dimensions of the strength and wisdom of women, and the generosity and sacrifice that is involved in bringing children into the world.  From the wise foundation that the Anglican order of nuns provides, to the newly trained professional midwives essentially in charge of the birthing process to the mothers from every kind of life putting their own lives on the line in order to birth new life, woman are acknowledged and celebrated.  How refreshing!!!",1390867200,5,625,4.933333333333334
5972996,5,B00FA9CIKQ,"I bought Call the Midwife seasons one and two because I kept missing some of the episodes.  So it was nice to watch them altogether.
I recieved the bonus disc which has the music from the series, unfortunately I am not a big fan of 50's music, I am a 60's child. All in all I am very pleased with my purchase.",1390780800,,309,3.9838709677419355
5972997,3,B00FA9CIKQ,While this series is entertaining. The storyline does not compare with Downton Abby. The acting is fairly good and you do start identifying with some of the characters.,1384819200,,168,5.035714285714286
5972998,5,B00FA9CIKQ,"UPDATE: AS SEASON 3 ROLLS OUT ON DVD, seasons 1 & 2 sell individually for less than $27 each on Amazon. Why pay double for the combo pack? Or is a CD really worth $50.00?
But the show is outstanding.

2 hot seasons. See them before the soon to be release of the third season. Young nurses assist older charitable nuns in East London poverty squalor. The birthing of a new generation. Action comes out of the Nonnatus House, but births take place in the dwellings of the pregnant women, or worse. Less than hospitable for a newborn, but whatever it takes, the nurses are up to the task.

Romance tickles the non-nun nurses adding a sub-plot, as do other medical conditions, and community situations. Episodes have multiple story threads at the same time, like contemporary novels. Viewers quickly learn personalities of regulars. Sometimes events are heartbreaking, sometimes heart warming. Sadness to LOL joy. Births and sometimes death. A lady's 1st child to 25th, literally. Triplets? Father's optional. Secrets and rampant gossip. It's all a part of the lives of these street nurses of the late 1950s. The settings are perfection, but not always idyllic. Many births are shown, with discrete use of camera angles. Delightful fifties Rock-n-roll music accompanies the episodes in all the right places. Beginning, ending, and other narration, given by the aged voice of the primary character, Jenny, is Vanessa Redgrave. The young girl, Jenny, is played by the lovely Jessica Raine, her first large role. Done well. She carries on through the first 2 seasons.

This show may give Downton Abbey (which is now scheduled for a 5th season) a run for its historic sterling money. Ten cast members are in all (or just missing one) episodes of season 1 and 2. Episodes always leaving viewers desiring more. There may never be an end to the series, as long as poor women continue to have babies. They call the midwife, and the midwife arrives, usually riding a bike. My baby doctor friend watched my sets and said it is perfect and very, very accurate.
Pam Ferris & Judi Parfitt (both of `Little Dorrit') are playing nuns.
14 50 min episodes, no episode titles, just numbered.
The Series 2 adds the 2012 Christmas special.
SDH SUBTITLES provided for those needing that.
The concept and beginning episodes are based on the memoirs of Jennifer Worth. That knowledge makes the scenes seem more relevant and historic.",1384473600,11,2406,4.892156862745098

Well made, the cast is just perfect, the sets and locations transport the viewer back to the late 50s - early 60s.
