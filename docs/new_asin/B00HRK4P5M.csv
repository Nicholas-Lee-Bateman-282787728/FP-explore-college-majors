6200597,2,B00HRK4P5M,"The dialogue seemed to be a series of cliches, and the ""best friend"" never seemed like a real person.  Don't know if the problem is direction or writing.  Good potential, never realized.",1419465600,4,186,4.78125
6200598,1,B00HRK4P5M,"Man returns to his home town to defend a high school friend charged with rape and murder of a high school student.

This movie is graphic. It revolves around what appears to be all too common in America--sexual perverts. The plot twists didn't save the movie. Having a god-like hero didn't do anything for the movie either. I mean who can relate to an emotionally dead robot who knows everything? No one. So he is unlikable as well. The only thing I got out of this typical predictable gross ""movie"" was how attractive the blond man was. All too often American TV and movies are filled with the ugliest people anymore. The actor playing the track coach was a good looking all-American man that used to be norm, but no more.",1419206400,2,723,4.519083969465649
6200599,5,B00HRK4P5M,the movie is excellent when could I buy the DVD,1417910400,,47,3.8
6200600,5,B00HRK4P5M,"Huge Michael Cudlitz fan.  Have been trying to find this movie ever since one of his fans suggested I watch.  This movie was part of a TNT Mystery Movie Night series.  At the time Michael was also on the TNT cop drama Southland.  He is an awesome actor that never disappoints with his abilities, his enthusiasm, and genuine love of acting.  If you love a good mystery with good acting (other actors also very good) then this would be an excellent choice.  This made-for-TV movie is good enough for the big screen.  With the constant twists and turns from the who-done-it aspect........never a dull moment with an amazing ending.  I thoroughly enjoyed.",1397260800,8,651,4.75
6200611,4,B00HRK4P5M,Good movie. An attorney returns to his childhood home to represent a friend in a murder investigation and has to face some demons from his own past. Good cast and storyline.,1449532800,,173,4.612903225806452

6200649,3,B00HRK4P5M,"This was a relentlessly three-ish movie, which to me means that it was quite watchable but otherwise unremarkable and not noteworthy.  What happens to a talented writer who moves into the Hollywood scene to hone his talents further, becomes a Hollywood person himself, and thereby loses touch with how people behave when they are likable?  I think he writes a movie like this: professionally constructed, the right kinds of twists,  just gripping enough to keep viewers' eyes on the screen, , and not a single character that a non-Hollywood type person could relate to.",1443139200,,569,5.031914893617022

6200657,1,B00HRK4P5M,It would be adviseable to wait until the real film is released.  This version was obviously just a walk through with a cast chosen at random from the street.,1442361600,,157,4.413793103448276

6200692,3,B00HRK4P5M,It was watchable but not great or memorable.  The acting was fairly decent.  Anne Heche's character was peculiar.  I think the movie failed in that once again the characters weren't sympathetic enough.  The ending should have been more of a surprise but it was predictable because the character wasn't likable enough.  Movies these days definitely need to work on character development.,1440979200,,386,5.262295081967213

It is an older movie, worst yet, it turned out to be a movie that played thru regular TV before, like with TNT (TNT productions) and I got suckered into renting and wasting money on it.
This was nothing than what it is, a glorified TV movie that somehow Amazon got his hands on it and now charging for it, when should be at the very least part of prime for those us that are prime members. Acting by Anne Heche and Delmot Mulroney were predictable and low caliber.

8634864,3,B00HRK4P5M,"I was going to give it 4 stars until I saw the end, but they changed it too much.  I realize most movies don't compare to the books, which is why I gave it 3 stars because it's better than most.  But, changing the end plus changing the nationality of some of the characters was too much. I know it's not possible to include every aspect of a story in a movie, but the part where he writes ""I love you"" on his mirror after taking a shower, doesn't make any sense unless you read the book.  Details like that would make these movies better.",1503187200,,538,4.104761904761904

8634871,1,B00HRK4P5M,"I was very excited about this movie because of some of the actors, in particular, Michael Cudlitz (Southland), but it was a huge disappointment. The script is full of underdeveloped clichs and the directing feels amateurish. It came across as a poorly produced 1970s made for TV drama.
