8333340,5,B001PIHP0E,"I really enjoyed this documentary. Excellent information, even better coverage of the events. Unlike some of the filmmaking documentaries I've seen on Amazon Instant Video, these guys were serious about their project. From script to post completion this group of filmmakers were focused on their craft. The creators of this documentary have constructed a magnificent piece equal to the feature in which they focused on.

GET THIS FILM! Don't miss the opportunity to see how an indie film is REALLY done.",1300924800,2,503,5.209876543209877
8333341,4,B001PIHP0E,"This DVD is essentially a behind the scenes documentary of the Ohio based indie production THE HORRORS OF WAR, a mashup of WW2 action, horror and a little sci-fi thrown in for good measure.  Whether or not you're into a genre blend like that is of little import.  If you're an indie filmmaker who lives somewhere besides Hollywood this is a good look at the production of a very ambitious independent feature.  If you can spare the cash get the feature and the documentary.",1263168000,,473,4.607142857142857
