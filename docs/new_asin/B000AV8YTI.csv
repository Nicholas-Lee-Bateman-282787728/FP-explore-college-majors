2394692,5,B000AV8YTI,"This dvd is a series of 13 moves, each 45 seconds long, for a total of 11 minutes.  Debbie Siebers has a bubbly personality and gives helpful input while doing each targeted segment.  I usually combine this dvd with two segments of one of my 10 minute solutions dvd's, only because I like to workout at least a half hour a day.  Great Buns is a tough little workout, giving you maximum moves in minimum time.",1240444800,4,408,4.342105263157895
2394693,5,B000AV8YTI,"Love,love,love this workout.  I used to put a lot of time into my workouts but since becoming a single mom I have very little time to squeeze in an effective exercise routine.  This workout gets the job done in a fraction of the time it would normally take.  There's no lengthy instruction period, you are tossed immediately into the sets.  My gluts were burning after the first three exercises so I know it's working. The key is stickability. If you can invest 11 minutes of your time a day, you will see results.  I use this in conjunction with Abs 100 and basic push ups.  Talk about a quick workout.",1217894400,6,603,4.4363636363636365
2394694,5,B000AV8YTI,"This really is a great DVD! I have spent a lot of money on finding DVDs with an effective bun and thigh workout, and I wish I could send them all back because this is the only one I need! It's really quick, the DVD begins immediatly so there is no sitting and listening to them talking and explaining, it just jumps right in to save you time. You do 13 different exercises, each continuously for 45 seconds long, then you jump to the next one so there is constant movement. The exercises are great, and you really can feel a burn. The DVD is 12 minutes total, so you can fit it in everyday and still get an excellent workout! I would recommend this to anyone. It makes a great beginners bun and thigh workout video!",1170633600,13,715,4.226277372262774
2394695,5,B000AV8YTI,This DVD has given me great buns in 30 days. It really works. The key is sticking to it and doing it everyday. It's fast so you don't get tired of it.,1148688000,10,150,3.71875
8079939,5,B000AV8YTI,I absolutely love this tape. I bought an extra copy. It's quick & easy but you do feel it. I had to work my way up to all the exercises but it's awesome. I'm going to start it again and post before & after pics,1495843200,,210,3.688888888888889
8079940,5,B000AV8YTI,"This video has been my go-to for a decade. Rough the first week or so but see(and feel) results within first couple of days. Is an efficient and effective use of time.  Also use the great abs dvd and, with the use of both, all major muscles are targeted and tightened (especially thighs, hips and lower abs/love handles). Can do both videos within 15 minutes and use the time of switching DVDs for a well earned breather. Gives minor changes (and reminders) to each exercise for beginners with urge-you-on commentary that is helpful to me every time I get down on the floor to feel the burn! Was grateful to find this available in dvd format and will continue to use for years to come.",1475539200,,685,4.48
8079941,5,B000AV8YTI,"I bought this series when it first came out on VHS.  It is an awesome targeted workout!  Don't think twice, just buy it!",1448064000,,120,4.173913043478261
8079942,5,B000AV8YTI,Excellent lower body workout. Great if you are short on time or do 3 rounds for a full 30 min lower body workout routine.,1414800000,,121,4.083333333333333
8079943,4,B000AV8YTI,"I like Ms. Sieber's dvds, ""Slim in Six"", so I decided to purchase this, I alternate this with my ""Brazilian Butt Lift"" dvd.
My boyfriend complements me on my buns daily! I think it's worth it!",1394928000,,192,4.361111111111111
8079944,3,B000AV8YTI,I think this is not worth the money and you would be better off buying her other DVDs that include bum exercises.,1393113600,,113,4.181818181818182
8079945,5,B000AV8YTI,"I purchased this product because I had the Video and wanted it on CD.  The exercises work, if done at least three times a week.  It takes about 30 to 60 days to see great results, but you will.  I highly recommend it.",1367193600,2,217,4.0
8079946,5,B000AV8YTI,"Like Thin Thighs Guaranteed, this workout targets a specific area...your buns. Now, everyone wants that. It requires dieting but you also need to build and tone muscle to get that 'look'. This workout is short and specific to that area. It is simple and effective. Anyone who does this will feel it the next day. The first time I did it I was working out for a long time and thought I could just breeze through it. I couldn't. I had to take a few breaks because I had never seen, or tried, exercises like these. They are very unusual, and some that are very usual, like sidekicks.

This workout aches my muscles in places I didn't even know I had muscles. Which is a great feeling!

So, if you can find it, give it a shot.",1319760000,3,722,4.262773722627737
8079947,5,B000AV8YTI,EXCELLENT BUTT WORKOUT.  I COULD FEEL THE WORKOUT BIG TIME THE NEXT DAY.  I LOVE THAT THE TAPE IS SHORT SO I CAN COMBINE IT WITH OTHER ROUTINES LIKE WEIGHTS OR YOGA :),1311984000,,167,4.03030303030303
8079948,3,B000AV8YTI,This dvd was just okay. Probably better for a beginner. I did not feel like I got much of a workout from it but I will say Debbie Seibers is a nice instructor and would check out other workouts from her.,1287619200,2,203,3.975609756097561
