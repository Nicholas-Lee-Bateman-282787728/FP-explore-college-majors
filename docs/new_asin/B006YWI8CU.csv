8506674,1,B006YWI8CU,WHEN YOU ARE CHARGED HALF WHAT YOU PAID FOR IT FOR RESTOCKING FEE .Make sure you read the product is what you wanted or you will be paying for it. It is not a concert of Dailey and Vincent  as I thought it was.,1527984000,,210,3.772727272727273
8506675,4,B006YWI8CU,"Excellent DVD on how Jamie Dailey, Darrin Vincent, Jeff Parker, and Christian Davis put together their legendary harmonies to create rich, full quartet singing! A surprise to me is that they put together their music by ear only, so that is the way they talk about their music. If you're used to reading notes on a page, this is an entirely different style of learning. But they achieve a great sound and are very talented, so Im sure everyone could learn something from these guys!",1519689600,,481,4.670588235294118

8506677,1,B006YWI8CU,Too much talk; too little singing.,1454457600,,34,4.833333333333333
8506678,5,B006YWI8CU,This group is awesome.  Beautiful harmony with their voices.  If you like Gospel and Bluegrass you need to buy their CDs and Videos.,1403481600,,132,4.695652173913044
8506679,3,B006YWI8CU,Didn't know what I was getting. Didn't realize it was a teaching video. I thought it would be a performance.,1401235200,,108,4.45
8506680,5,B006YWI8CU,"Dailey and Vincent's DVD is fun to watch and listen to. Not as simplified as I'd hoped for. The examples were great and the harmony at it's best. Not to informative on how to develop which notes to pick when not singing the melody line. I would like to have heard more simple examples of how to develop and practice harmony lines without migrating back to the melody line. I was looking for more exercise type examples that would develop both the ear and the voice for harmony singing. Better purposed for musicians with understanding of chord structure and notes within those chords. I guess when you start with the ""Sally Mountain Show"" Vincent family band and sing all of your life you absorb much of the context of music that many of us lack.",1379980800,2,746,4.533333333333333
8506681,4,B006YWI8CU,"Informative and entertaining, for those of us who enjoy listening, but are not so talented or skilled. This quartet and band are fantastic. We enjoy them recorded and even more in person.",1375142400,,187,4.875
