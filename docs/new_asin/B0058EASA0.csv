I found it very interesting how they approached their goal of building the ultimate super car.  Talk about state of the art technology! WOW!",1340064000,3,276,4.571428571428571
8461444,5,B0058EASA0,"We watched this DVD about 5 times the first week we had it. We loaned it out to a few of my husband's ""car guy"" friends. This is a start to finish biography on how the Bugatti is made. Definitely not a factory built car! The movie is very enticing and full of information.",1467936000,,272,4.055555555555555

8461447,5,B0058EASA0,"This is by far the best Super Car report I ever saw!  Congratulations to both Amazon and Nat. Geo.
I sincerely hope Amazon will soon sell the Nat. Geo. DVD on NISSAN's fabulous GTR.
(I bought the NISSAN dvd advertized by Duke Marketing. Disappointing .. not bad, but far from the Nat. Geo. series' quality).
Well? The ball's now in YOUR court!
