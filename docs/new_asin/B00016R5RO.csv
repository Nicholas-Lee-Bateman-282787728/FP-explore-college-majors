1974952,2,B00016R5RO,"While the fire is very nice, the DVD itself arrived with several scratches which caused the ""movie"" to pause, have ""boxes"" in it and ultimately stopped playing altogether. Nice fire, poor CD quality.",1074902400,5,199,5.0606060606060606
1974953,5,B00016R5RO,"I live in a condo without a fireplace, I found this a novel approach to use for my last party.  As a decorator, I appreciate the warm sensual atmosphere and ambiance it creates. The best part is no mess, no fuss, no muss or logs to purchase! It's the perfect backdrop for a guests and for a lark at my next gathering of friends, I am going to provide marshmallows for everyone to toast.",1074643200,2,386,4.216216216216216
1974954,5,B00016R5RO,"I had never even seen a virtual fireplace film before, but at my niece's birthday party (she's 2) my brother had ""My Fireplace"" playing on his TV instead of the real thing. You really can't have a real fire in the room with 10 2-and 3 year olds running around. Well, after about the first hour I completely forgot it was only playing on the TV! It seemed so real everyone (including the children) even cozied up around it as the party went on. After the party ended, I borrowed the DVD from my brother and played it on my bedroom's plasma screen as I fell asleep. To say it was nice doesn't express my true opinion. You can almost feel the heat rising away from the flames on the screen. I've really missed having a fireplace in my own home for so long and finally I have an excellent replacement! Thank you so much.",1074124800,4,816,4.2709677419354835
1974955,5,B00016R5RO,"I first saw this video in a beautiful Malibu home for a very stylish birthday event. There they had a really nice real fireplace, but used this DVD instead! During a party, this is a great thing to have playing in the background because you don't have to keep getting logs or worry about sparks popping out on the carpet. The colors in this video are very vivid and sharp and the fire sounds are very clear and crisp. This DVD will be great for my boat where real fire is too dangerous. It's a continuous two-hour tape, so you would have to be pretty observant to see the loop. I have not seen the other fireplace video in this section of Amazon, but after reading their reviews, I'm definitely glad I got this one. I am sure the production company that made this DVD will probably raise their prices as more of these reviews come in, so I would pick up one for yourself, and a few for gifts before they figure it out.",1073952000,8,918,4.251428571428572
1974956,5,B00016R5RO,"Quality!  Really smooth production quality.  AND for less money than inferior tapes and DVDs out there!  Unlike some other videos this has excellent vibrancy in the color of the flames, clean sound with crisp crackling of the logs.  The digital mastering is absolutely beautiful.  This is a peaceful, soothing fireplace that burns for two full hours.  The best 'atmosphere tape' I own.",1073088000,4,385,5.129032258064516
8007278,3,B00016R5RO,I originally purchased one of these DVD'S last year and loved it so much I ordered another one for a second computer but it arrived unattached in the jewel case which damaged the DVD.  A replacement was provided and it is working fine.  Outside of this issue I love this DVD.  I think it has one of the best fireplace shows around.,1265414400,,331,4.306451612903226
8007279,1,B00016R5RO,"I received this DVD...Twice.  First one didn't work.

Second one worked as long as I would ff the ""glitchy"" parts. Now it doesn't work at all, in any DVD player.

Terrible manufacturing.  Too bad, because the fire itself is nice.",1143331200,,229,4.65
8007280,5,B00016R5RO,"This  is the best fireplace DVD I've found. The fire is consistently blazing and the sound is inviting. I often use it at home even though I have three fireplaces. It's cheaper and I like the background visuals. Mostly, I use it my classroom on cold days. I teach Adult English learners and a firelace is a luxury many don't have. They enjoy it on chilly mornings.",1140393600,,364,4.432835820895522
8007281,1,B00016R5RO,The first shipment arrived badly damaged due to faulty packagaing and the replacement shipment had a terminal error around 24min.  After that I gave up - I'm thankful for Amazon's painless return process.,1126656000,4,204,5.181818181818182
8007282,5,B00016R5RO,"Not only is this a good video but a GREAT video with excellent quality. Being a professional photographer I appreciate good quality and found the video to be exactly what I had anticipated in both video and audio presentation.

Okay, it didn't smell like a real fire but, then again, I didn't expect it to.

Unless you are looking for a real fire and are burning 'knotty pine' for loud popping sounds (although pine is terrible for chimneys and not recommended) I am sure that you also will be pleased with this work. I definitely recommend it!",1110153600,5,544,4.597938144329897
8007283,2,B00016R5RO,"The images presented are by far the best part of this DVD.  Real logs are slowly burnt down and the looping is fairly seamless.  You really won't notice unless you're staring intensely.  The shot is framed to focus on the fire itself and there's no visual real estate wasted on the facade of the fireplace.  The fire looks exactly like the picture on the cover of the DVD box that Amazon lists.

The audio track is a big disappointment, and the driver behind my two star rating.  The crackle of the fire is barely audible at lower volumes, and when you turn it up your ears will be assaulted by an overwhelming amount of hissing and static.  There's no option for an alternative audio track with holiday music.  If you buy this DVD, don't plan on using the audio for atmospheric purposes.  Gazing at a muted fireplace just isn't the same.

While I don't doubt that earlier versions of the DVD were printed out on an inkjet, the label as of Feb 2005 is silk screened on.  However, the underside has the tell-tale purple/blue color of an inexpensive reproduction method.  Occasionaly the video jitters,  and although it's not very noticable, it may be related to the DVD-R nature of the disc.  It's amusing to note that the screen capture on the cover of the box hasn't been deinterlaced.

Although Amazon only lists James Dixon as the author, Madison Lewis is actually given first billing on the back cover of the box and on the front of the DVD.  It's worth noting that the address to contact the copyright holders is P.O. Box 6235 Malibu, CA, 90264.  This makes me a little suspicious of the estatic review entitled ""The Best Fireplace Video Offered by Amazon Hand Down!"", which was written by someone from the Malibu area.

I spent a long time comparing the other fireplace DVDs on Amazon before purchasing this one, and the only other title that seemed worthwhile was Ambient Fire 3rd Edition.  But I haven't seen it so I can't comment on it in comparison.  Had the audio on My Fireplace been better, I wouldn't be considering returning it and purchasing Ambient Fire instead.",1110067200,10,2079,4.628415300546448
8007284,5,B00016R5RO,"I've seen a couple of other fireplace DVDs and they loop and just show the same thing over and over.  When I put this one in, I could almost smell the oak logs burning!  Very relaxing DVD.  Excellent!",1108857600,2,200,4.2105263157894735
8007285,4,B00016R5RO,"I recently received the cd ""My Fireplace"" and I love it ! This CD is so real feeling, it makes you want to stand in front of the TV to warm your hands.

I know now that Winter is here I will use this CD a lot.

I always loved camping and watching the fire is one of the things I have missed the most. This works!",1098230400,6,312,3.6417910447761193
8007286,4,B00016R5RO,"I've read all the Reviews before purchasing this DVD so i expected the worse because of what i heared about the  labeling. Well to be honest the labeling isn't professional at all but the Ink didn't just rob off! and the Disk didn't have any scarches.

When it comes to the Scene Quality i think it's the best. I've bought many similar DVDs but i never felt that i'm sitting infront of a real one as i'm feeling right now.

I'd recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to turn his TV into a REAL Fireplace and wouldn't care much about how the DVD itself looks like.",1090886400,5,563,4.242990654205608
8007287,3,B00016R5RO,"Don't have much to add to the other reviews here (i.e., it's an ok presentation of a fireplace). This production seems to be a homegrown project: buyers should be aware that the labeling on the disc was applied using an inkjet printer- it is not silk screened. Some of the ink around the edge of the disk will easily rub off on your fingers or clothes. Take a cloth and wipe the edges before handling the disk.",1078617600,4,410,4.337662337662338
