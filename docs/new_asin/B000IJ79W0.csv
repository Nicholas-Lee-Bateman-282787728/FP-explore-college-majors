Second, it's not as good as I thought (hence the 4 stars instead of 5)...

ULTIMATE JORDAN

The most comprehensive coverage of Jordan's dazzling career is OK. There is too much talk and too little highlights, but that is the weakness of every NBA package. Jordan has many highlights that are not present (and that could've been included), but all that is forgivable when you get to the extra features: Michael's BEST dunks, moves, assists, clutch-shots and Michael's great 8 games. These extra-features are the best part of the whole package, since you get MJ in an exciting NBA-Action Top 10 Countdown format - you'll be thrilled even if you saw ALL of them before because thare is very little chit-chat!

MAGIC: ALWAYS SHOWTIME & LARRY BIRD: BASKETBALL LEGEND

Magic's and Larry's career were as impressive as Michael's, but again - too little highlights and too many talking heads telling us how great Magic was. Aslo, I don't like this kind of rewriting the history, showing only the highs and (almost) forgetting the lows. And finally - there are no extra-features like on MJ's DVD! WTF? Surely Magic and Larry had enough highlights to put on a TOP 10 in every category!

And finally the third - the included complete games: MJ x5, Larry x3 and Magic x3...

As great as those games were, the choices are a bit peculiar, especially regarding Magic and Bird. I mean, two games from Magic's rookie year and one All-star game after he retired? Not one game from his 1987 MVP season when he downed Boston in the Garden? Only one Playoff's Game for Bird? And finally - no whole game with ""The Shot"" for MJ? Come on!!!

But let us go back to what is good about those games: what is great about those games is that you see basketball as it should be played: a combo of smarts, skill and atlethicism compared to today's no-smarts, low level-skills and steroid-athlesticism. You can see here how all ten players on the court could make a layup with their right or left hand, as well as how all big man could put the ball on the floor or pass the ball which is a lost art today, except for Steve Nash, Jason Kidd and maybe Lebron James.

Also, you'll see that team-defenses prior to ""Bad Boys"" were virtually non existent, that refs called the game in star's favour exactly like today, but there were a lot less whistled calls compared to today's game. And you'll notice there was very little complaining about refereeing back then.

The quality of the early games (1980-1983) is not so good, but that's understandable.

So, overall? A good introduction to each of these basketball legends. MJ's bit of package is the best, while Magic's and Bird's falters a bit (not including extra-features). The games are a great treat, but the choice could be better...",1168819200,7,2881,4.662721893491124
