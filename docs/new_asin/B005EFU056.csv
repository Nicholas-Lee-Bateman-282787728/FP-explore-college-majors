This series is a brilliant way to learn about the life experience of real people by way of CSI. I have learned a great deal. The experts are brilliant and personable, the mysteries are amazing.

I wish this could be priced in a manner someone could actually afford.",1527984000,,330,4.306451612903226
8468178,5,B005EFU056,Lower the price $310 less and someone might purchase it. One DVD isn't worth this much. The show is great but not worth paying this much for one DVD. You must be desperate for money.,1500163200,,182,4.228571428571429
