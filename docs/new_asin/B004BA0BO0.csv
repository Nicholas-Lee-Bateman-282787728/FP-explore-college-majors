8421756,5,B004BA0BO0,"I didn't know much about the events in Ada, OK before seeing Death of the Old West, but I found the documentary to be very engaging and well-made. The archival photos are fascinating and often strangely beautiful and the contemporary footage is very well-shot. A nice snapshot of Ada around the turn of the 20th century is created and the activities of the key players, as well as their relationships with each other, are explored in some depth. The comments by current residents of Ada are also very interesting. One reviewer mentioned that there should have been more said about the significance of the death of Jim Miller and that might be true, as he emerges as the most dangerous outlaw by far in the story. However, some historical context is provided, both for Miller and Oklahoma itself at that time, and I understand that the filmmakers probably needed to bring the film in at a few minutes under an hour for broadcast, which they did. And it is a very worthwhile hour spent on an important if somewhat obscure event that may well have been one of the last of its kind in the Wild West.",1407369600,,1095,4.563451776649746

8421759,3,B004BA0BO0,"This is a nicely made little documentary with some interesting facts regarding ""the death of the old west"", as the Ada, OK lynchings were referred to as.  While informative regarding the actual lynchings, it lacked sufficient back stories that led to this event.  In particular, that of Jim ""Deacon Miller.  Despite his lack of presence in popular culture and hollywood films, Miller was the deadliest villain of the Old West era, having probably killed over 50 men.  His story, while morbid, is an important element to the story of the 1909 hangings. His murderous and cold blooded behavior and ability to avoid prosecution affected many people of that time and there are many decedents of people who knew or were affected by this man.  While the feud that led to Miller's demise was a key element, the biggest story of that time was the death of a true ruthless monster of a man whom was eulogized by one man who simply said ""Jim Miller, He was just a killer, the worst man I ever knew""  It was still worth the purchase, as it  documents on film the story of a very significant event in Oklahoma and U.S. history.",1385683200,,1115,4.601010101010101
