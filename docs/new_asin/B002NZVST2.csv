3960669,1,B002NZVST2,"I got this video for those days , when you feel like the gym, it is not the best option, but after watching for three minutes it was to much to take. I felt like I want to got to bed, boring, boring safe you money. If you looking for somethin fun get something else.",1311811200,,266,3.8545454545454545
3960670,3,B002NZVST2,"If you have any dance experience whatsoever, the first routine with the veil will be boring.  The only ""fun"" thing is the veil work, and it's repetitive and slow.  The first song is not terribly exciting and reminds me more of bellydancing than bollywood.  Bollywood is really bouncy and high-energy and the later two songs embody that more.  It's a fun DVD overall, with a good progression, but for someone with any experience, you may be bored.",1294963200,,446,4.753246753246753
3960671,5,B002NZVST2,"Out of twenty five or so dance workouts this is one of my absolute favorites! The set up is wonderful. First there is a warm-up (the same for all three dances, as is the cool down) then you can separately choose to learn the dances step by step, or simply do the dance routine which is great once you have learned the steps. In other words you don't have to go through the learning the steps precess EVERY time you want to do this workout. You can just dance! The dances are done to the entire song. The music is fun as are the dance moves (they get your heart rate up). The instruction is clear. Some of the choreography is challenging, which I like so that it doesn't become boring to quickly. I cannot recommend this workout enough. I wish I owned more workouts like this one.",1292544000,8,779,4.27027027027027
3960672,4,B002NZVST2,This workout was easy to follow and supprisingly worked up a good sweat. I like the different choices in workouts.,1286150400,2,114,4.75
3960673,5,B002NZVST2,"I've been dancing for 6 years and have recently been using dance even more as a fitness tool.  The Bollyrobics Dance Workout had 3 really cute songs choreographed to workout with.  I found the songs to download from Amazon so I could use them and I've enjoyed it very much, but am disappointed that it is the only one.  I wish they would make more of Bollyrobics workouts!",1284249600,5,372,4.4411764705882355
3960674,1,B002NZVST2,"Good music. I'll give it that. I just took a Bollywood dancing course and saw some other DVDs and based on both bollywood dancing AND aerobics dvds, I can't recommend this to anyone. The step by step is not. I've taken a lot of dance classes and been in a lot of step, floor, and dance gym classes and used many workout DVDs and this was unhelpful and, just weird. The dancer is dancing on top of what looks like a Windows 3.0 title screen, with glittery, cheesy sparkles raining down in the background while the dancer (who takes up about 1/10th of the screen)is dancing in the middle - but seriously I couldn't figure out if she was computer generated or not for the first 10 minutes until she made a facial expression convincing me otherwise.

The warm up is nearly precisely the same as the step by step guide except she stops every few minutes to strike a breathing pose, but there is very little 'warm up' to it other than that.

Once in the 'step by step' portion, she goes through moves very quickly, from stepping outwards to including arm gestures in the span of seconds before really establishing the foot work. This is then repeated many times, I suppose to teach you the dance, but realistically, I didn't feel like I was doing a workout so much as trying desperately to flail my arms about while keeping up with footwork. It wasn't exciting for me and I was really horrified by the cheese factor with the computer graphics in the background and the lack of focus and detail on the dancer.

The enjoyment I got from it was watching the final dance performance, which I watched and didn't bother to participate in because I had given up on the step by step portion (out of boredom) long ago. I think this one will be shelved, or even sold second-hand because I won't use it again.",1280448000,3,1792,4.4407294832826745
3960675,5,B002NZVST2,"I just enjoyed this DVD. The music is good and you can chosse to do one part and master the moves. You can even show off to your friends and tell them: hey, I am a bollywood dancer(Smiles). Try this DVD if you are looking for a change. You will love it. If it seems difficult at the beginning, just do the step by step several times. You will still sweat. Enjoy!!!",1273276800,5,364,4.069444444444445
3960676,4,B002NZVST2,"Alot of moves in this video. I did not find it high impact but a decent work out.  Three different choreographys each with warm up, steps broken down, dance and cool down. After learning the moves one could do just the dance parts to get a more intense workout. I will be putting this on my wish list.",1268524800,3,301,4.189655172413793

8375690,1,B002NZVST2,"I love to work out and get different dvds to watch, when i got this one i wasn't that enthused. Its like so basic, don't waste your money on this one",1377907200,,149,3.838709677419355
8375691,1,B002NZVST2,"I've seen better.  Never one to totally diss a product but I was not pleased with the instructions.  The narrator continues to count when there is no movement, It's just hard to follow.

No complaints on the seller.  The disc played normally on my blue ray as expected.",1362960000,,269,4.541666666666667
8375692,1,B002NZVST2,"The workout is not at a fast pace and totally uninteresting and boring. Very disappointed with this purchase. The DVD however, arrived in a good condition within the expected time frame.",1362528000,,186,5.032258064516129
8375693,4,B002NZVST2,"I picked up this DVD at an electronics store in Germany around 2006 when it came out without ever hearing about it. Since then I have done this workout countless times.

Sure, it's low budget, but it doesn't make it less good. I like that it isn't totally over the top like some other bollywood dance videos I've seen. Though it is kind of funny that when you do the dance, you get three of Julie Casper to make it look like there are several dancers.

I like it because:

1. It's cute, Julie Casper does a great job of showing the dance steps and gives it a cute feel to it
2. Fun music
3. Made me feel like I could really dance
4. If you get into it you'll definitely get a sweat

If you're looking for a dance workout of high intensity to whip you into shape, this is probably not what you're looking for.

But if you are looking for a fun kind of light dance workout you might like this one!",1340496000,2,895,4.0625
8375694,2,B002NZVST2,This DVD has a very small image of the dancer/instructor against a very large background. I don't want to have to put on glasses to see the moves which I am trying to execute during a workout. I have a collection of over 70 workout DVD's and this is the only one during which I couldn't see the instructor well enough to execute the moves.,1339286400,2,339,4.230769230769231
8375695,5,B002NZVST2,"I first previewed this DVD through my online video rental before purchasing it through Amazon. I love Bollywood movies, music and dance and needed some motivation to get moving. This DVD fit the bill. If you are someone with a great deal of dance experience it may not be the program for you. If, however, you are like myself and have neglected yourself for a few years and want a fun way to get back into the swing of things, I recommend this DVD. The steps are basic which means that will a little practice you can pick them up. I admit it can feel a little slow learning the movements but once you have them down, you can move onto the dance portion and this is where the fun begins. Is it a stunning Bollywood number? No, but it does have the fun, flirty feel and if you are a fan of Bollywood, you will definitely recognize many of the moves and even the music.",1329696000,2,866,4.22289156626506
8375696,5,B002NZVST2,"I have somewhat recently gotten into dance workout videos and this one is great because it's very dancy, and I really dug the music. I thought the simplicity of the filming and the background graphics were interesting and modern. I have very little dance experience, so some of the moves were challenging, but I don't mind, I did the best I could, and I know I'll get better. This kind of video may not be for everyone, from reading some of the reviews, but it inspires me. Worth the money for me, for sure.",1319673600,2,507,4.404255319148936
