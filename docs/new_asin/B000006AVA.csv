8633795,5,B000006AVA,"Director/writer Robert Brody debutes a film too strong for the average audence.  Be warned: this film breaks new ground with ""in your face"" horror.  Its 1991 release was short lived as mainstream audiences were sickened (some to the point of barfing on other theater goers) by the surprising and unexpected gore.  However, the movie's cult following has grown so large that this new release was inevitable.  Don't expect to see it in any but a handful of art theaters and a few midnight shows, where the squemish don't go.  Better to watch it at home where you can keep a hot towel and an ice bag handy.
  The plot revolves around Grant Sutherland as a cop who offers no succor for your fear of a serial killer who stalks, then brutally slaughters women. Add a psychic, going psycho herself, from seeing through the eyes of the victims, and you've got yourself a ballgame.  As the plot spews its guts, you may have trouble hanging on to your own.  Enter a retired cop (James Doohan, Scotty from Star Trek) who reveals that a string of similar unsolved murders occured on his watch. (They're dead, Jim.)  As the ads say, ""Can it be the same killer on the loose, or is it the work of a copycat? With the horror of the past colliding head-on with the growing terror of the present, no one is safe from the maniac's insane bloodlust."" A horror fan's delight.  A Mother's nightmare.",998006400,3,1377,4.556910569105691
