8172617,5,B000MV8GX0,"Superb presentation.  After having searched for decades for this performance after having seen it just once on PBS in the late 1970's.  It breaths spontaneity and new life into this old warhorse.  Never meant to be a horror story (as portrayed in Hollywood movies,  e.g., the Jack Palance version), here you can see it as the  TRAGEDY it was meant to be!",1506816000,,354,4.645161290322581
8172618,5,B000MV8GX0,I first saw this on PBS when I was in high school and have wanted to see it again for years.  I finally did and it was as good as I remember.  The late David Hemmings was a great Jekyll/Hyde and I particularly like the fact that they followed the original and made Jekyll an older man while Hyde was young.  Aside from Hammer's Two Faces Of Dr. Jekyll this may have been one of the first productions to do that.,1394323200,,411,4.049382716049383
