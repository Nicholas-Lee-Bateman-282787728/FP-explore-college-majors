8582070,1,B00CIOFVB4,This product came without a booklet. I was curious who the band members are but absolutely no information included. Documentary?? It is a club gig with less than 8 songs ( last one cuts off before completion of song) from 1991.. Pictures on case deceiving showing him in later years & not reflecting the contents.. I felt ripped off,1388534400,,332,4.6440677966101696
8582071,1,B00CIOFVB4,not what I expected I have his cd and it was much better that is why I decided to buy his dvd,1388361600,,93,3.272727272727273
8582072,3,B00CIOFVB4,Only 8 tracks of music.  Not downloadable to amazon cloud Player.  Good to see Buddy circa 1991.  Pricey for only 8 tracks.,1373500800,3,123,4.5
8582073,2,B00CIOFVB4,"Let's start with Mr. Guy as legendary he is without doubt one of the blues greats of all time. He inspires me to keep playing the best I can. The wife and I have been going to his performances for many years and are great fans of his. Now the Documentary, which it is not and that is the biggest disappointment. After recently finishing his diary book, I was very much looking forward to hearing and watching his life story on screen and hearing it in his own words. I did not get what I paid for in this regards as this is not a documentary. The only time Buddy opens his mouth is to sing. Yes the music was as no other than Buddy can, great. The audio was at best a 6 on my scale. The video quality was also a let down also giving it a 6 and that's generous. Additionally, there was no inside pamphlet that normally accompanies even the cheapest of music video's. I'll probably give this video away, I know I won't watch it again. If your looking for a Documentary, don't go here, buy his book.",1373328000,7,996,4.16580310880829
8582074,4,B00CIOFVB4,"I strongly suggest this DVD, a recording of a German TV show at a time when Buddy was being rediscovered (BUDDY GUY - OHNE FILTER 1991). It's a great performance from Buddy & his Band with a very talented Scott Holt, a support guitarist who was with Buddy for a what seemed like a decade or so. Both the title and description of this DVD are very misleading. ""A Musical Documentary"" & ""This musical documentary contains rarely seen live performances"" gave me hope for a career spanning DVD full of true rarities.  American Folk Blues Festival? Nope. 708 Club footage? Afraid not. Musical documentary? I don't think so. Contains rarely seen live performance(s)? Well there is only ONE live performance. No ""s"" included. RARE? Only if you don't have access to youtube.
With all of this said, It's still a great thing to have Live material from Buddy. Just don't expect any diversity, just one solid show.",1373068800,6,902,4.745222929936306
