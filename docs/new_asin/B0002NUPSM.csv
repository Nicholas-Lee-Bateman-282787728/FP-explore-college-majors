8029675,1,B0002NUPSM,"This is a list of 75 or so martial artists in alphabetical order. The monotone narrator (who also produced the film and is listed as a Great American Master/Champion)gives a paragraph length explanation of the importance of the martial artist, and then there is footage from that person. Lots of katas, ancient footage from high school gyms, with little exciting footage. I cannot recommend this documentary. Lastly, some of the footage was pulled from the movie ""The Warrior Within"" which is vastly superior to this, and is a must have.",1240876800,2,537,4.977777777777778
