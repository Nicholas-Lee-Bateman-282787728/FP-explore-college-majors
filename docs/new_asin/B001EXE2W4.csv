3557793,5,B001EXE2W4,"As I have said in other reviews most books about the Civil War are about the well known battles/generals, etc.  This gives us knowledge of secrets going on behind the battles, movement of troops, etc.  It is amazing how much was happening that the general population knew nothing about.",1332460800,5,286,4.816326530612245
3557794,4,B001EXE2W4,"I don't think the HISTORY CHANNEL has ever produced a bad documentary.
This series of investigations of quirky events in the US Civil War is really engrossing... and I'm an Aussie. At times a little over-re-enacted and repetitive, it nevertheless is engaging story-telling. Unfortunately only available in Region 1 mode (why do they do this? - there's a whole world market out there you US centric media people). However, if you have a program such as ANYDVD, it will crack the coding and make it easy to copy the disc to make it playable on any DVD in the world.",1268870400,15,563,4.64
3557795,4,B001EXE2W4,"Product came exactly as describe, brand new. Got here in the time that it stated. The tracking # they gave me didn't work, so I asked for a new one and they took over a week to get back to me, by which time I had the product, but other than that, a great transaction!",1261958400,2,267,3.8727272727272726
3557796,5,B001EXE2W4,"This collection of programs from the History Channel is a treasure trove of information on little known or previously forgotten incidents of the Civil War.  At first I thought, ""How could I have missed this series?"", then discovered that the set is a compilation of previously aired programs that are informative, as well as entertaining.  I have recommended this set to several people, and each one of them has reported that they are glad they have been informed about these little ""jewels"".",1233619200,38,492,4.987804878048781
3557797,5,B001EXE2W4,"""Secrets of the Civil War""  is a four-disc set containing an in-depth look at significant, but not well-known, battles of the war, from Antietam to Shiloh to Gettysburg.  Archival letters, original diary entries, cinematic reenactments and interviews with noted historians bring events that occurred over 140 years ago to vivid life.  We learn that in the cavalry charge at Mine Creek, Kansas, it took only 30 minutes for 2,800 Union troops to defeat an enemy force more than double in size.  Also covered is a Confederate raid on Vermont and an attempt by Union coal miners to blow up a Southern fort by tunneling underneath it.  Nine separate programs from the History Channel are included.",1226707200,46,692,4.982608695652174
