Surreal, weird, insightful. Might make a good movie or reality TV show. Difficult to comprehend.",1470873600,,254,4.543478260869565
8310517,1,B000I01K6K,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  It is nothing but a poorly put together advertisement for other so called DVDs. This is a total rip off. Mine is going right back. I am a fan of Dr. Brian O'Leary and cannot believe that his good name is being allowed to be put on this piece of thievery. Shame on the individuals who put this garbage out!!!  If I could give it a negative 30 stars, I would.",1447459200,,383,4.026315789473684
8310518,1,B000I01K6K,"Extremely poor video quality. even though it is a DVD it seems that the original video source for both movies were old worn out VHS tapes.
""Portrait of a Showgirl"" plays like an old ""made fo TV"" movie, boring, on a 1-10 scale overall I give it about a 2, and it only scores that high because the other movie on the disc would score a negative 5
""The second comming of suzanne"" is just horrible!!! Incomprehensable dialog at very low volume level in comparison to the overly loud background soundtrack. Its as if a group of filmmaker wannabee's with an average IQ of 50 tried to make a film on a $50.00 budget. Worst of all this is a censored version. The original release had some partial nude erotic scenes with Sondra Locke, The back of the DVD case even states ""includes erotic scenes featuring Sondra Locke"" BUT THOSE SCENES ARE NOT ACTUALLY IN THE MOVIE ON THE DISC!!!",1358380800,,873,4.4625
