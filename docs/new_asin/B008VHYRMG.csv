8530901,5,B008VHYRMG,"Lucio Fulci's Italian Splatter Horror fest means a great deal to me
Due to the fact it's the first Fulci Film i discovered late in my Collecting

I'm gonna share with you the day I came across the Beyond on DVD
It was late spring of 2001 had no car (Due to my little sister wrecking my only car) It wasn't exactly a great car but, it was mine and I needed a wheels to go to and from my new job
I was able to get my Grandfather to let me take his pride and joy a 1977 Ford T-Bird to work while i looked for a new car
Found out about a CD Store 35 miles away That took used CD's in Trade for store credit or cash
Went through my massive collection of cd's found 150 cd's to take there for trade (CD's I know longer wanted/I needed to cut down on my cd Collection) Drove to this Store handed the sales man a massive box of CD's told him i'll take Store credit
I looked around this store was very cool (It was a typical late 90's Music Store) but, they also sold vinyl records, VHS Tapes , and the new Hot format DVD
I wanted to add more to my very small dvd Collection (Maybe had 6-8 dvd's) Keep in mind this was very early on Best Buy & Circuit City still sold more VHS over the dvd Format
This store actually had a lot of dvd's for a small Music retail shop the problem was they were super over priced
While looking through what they had on dvd i seen a few things that Interest me, one being this super Cool Limited Edition Tin of The Beyond (with the coolest art work and a massive warning label on the front of the case (No one Under 17 Should view this Film) The downside to this Limited Tin it was marked at $39.99 so i just put it back and talked to the manager about my Store credit
I was lucky to get $125.00 Store Credit so I swallowed really hard and gave in and added The Limited Edition of The Beyond (Anchor Bay TIN) to the stack of stuff I took...... That DVD was a massive blind buy (There were no smart phones to check price matching, etc.)
Later on a day or two later I cracked up the TIN (I've bought a number of Special Edition Anchor Bay VHS Tapes) So i knew Anchor Bay at the time was a 5 Star Distributor they really put there heart and soul into this stuff back in the days of dvd's
This Film blew me away everything about it even on a SD tv you could pick up on the Beautiful Lighting,The Production Values were insane everything is practical and Organic and it adds so much to the film over all
The Beyond IMO one the Best Italian Horror Films ever! It pulls no punches and doesn't pull back when most films would
The Ending is Anti Hollywood =Meaning it's more realistic Life is complicated Life is messy There is no real Disney Ending
After watching this Film the first time I became a die hard Luci Fulci Fan i tried to get all his Horror Work very quickly
I probably watched this dvd at least 5 times in a month 'Cause it was so fresh and unique and just Perfect even the negatives with this film you can turn to Positives......
I was so obsessed at the time I over payed to get my hands on the Limited Edition version of Zombie on Laserdisc (Needless to say I payed more for a outdated Laserdisc then for the New Format dvd) But, any Collector can relate to this
Collecting is very much a OCD thing some people will not admit that I on the other hand know what I am and admit it freely

Enough of this Palaver lets get the show on the road

I'm gonna try and review and point out the Positives & Negatives surrounding the Blu Ray home video versions of
Lucio Fulci's The Beyond (Note: I've had almost every version of the beyond put out on DVD) I've seen it with terrible edits The Seven Doors of Death **On The Cheap** dvd) to HQ DVD's like the AnchorBay Version & The 2008 Grindhouse Releasing, Inc. Version

Alternative colour pre-credits sequence
Original International Trailer

The Grindhouse (So-Called Limited Edition BR)
I'm gonna be completely Honest this BR is a utter disgrace Grindhouse took there previous dvd version from 2008 and Transfer everything from the dvd on to the HD Blu Ray and put the extras on a second BR Disc to pad this set!! All the extras are copied and pasted from the dvd and it's Cheap and a joke over all The only thing remotely exclusive is the Bonus CD with the Newly Remastered Soundtrack album (The cd comes in this uber cheap cardboard case God forbid they figure out how to put it in the case
I'm pretty sure Grindhouse bought the US Rights to the Arrow HD Transfer and just carried over the Film itself and tacked on ""old"" dvd extras
The Grindhouse Version is a quick money grab Nothing more nothing less (No Real exclusives) Except a CD that's in a cheap cardboard case
I payed $30.00 for the BR when it was on sale Massive waste of $$$$ IMO

Without a doubt buy and cherish the Arrow Home Video Version that is the BEST and only way to get a Proper BR of the Beyond
Buy the 2008 Grindhouse Release dvd don't Support a Company that Thinks so little of Fans the only thing they give is a bloody CD Soundtrack for a exclusive selling point
I Love The Beyond The film over all is Close to Perfect 9.8/10
But, whatever you do DON'T Buy the Grindhouse BR it's a massive money grab that is a smack to the face to Fulci and his fans!",1436918400,,7066,4.316265060240964
8530902,5,B008VHYRMG,The Aarow edition is a collector's dream come true. The first disc is a blu ray with an outstanding high definition transfer. There are multiple commentaries to choose from if one chooses.  The second disc is a D.V.D. with a lot of extras sure to please the most eager of fans. The collection comes with a dual sided poster for wall hanging and four different covers for whichever box cover art you choose to display on the front. I have bought many editions of this film and this version is the best of them all by a long shot.,1423180800,,528,4.333333333333333

8530904,4,B008VHYRMG,"(The review pertains to the 2012 Arrow Blu Ray)
Perversely entertaining movie that vascillates between camp, gorehounding, and (rarely) atmospheric horror.  At this point it's unlikely that you'd  be buying The Beyond without knowing something about it in advance.  I've never liked Fulci as much as some of his contemporaries (especially Argento), but his obvious enthusiasm for creative violence compensates for his lackadaisical plots, clumsy editing, and variable-quality special effects.  His movies tend to be fairly bleak, but again, you probably know what you're getting into.

As for the Blu Ray, it's a solid transfer, good detail, generally consistent grain, good color saturation in the indoor scenes (the outdoor scenes tend to be washed out or hazy, which I attribute to middling cinematography rather than Blu Ray issues - again, Fulci is no Argento).  The soundtrack is what you would expect, with canned-sounding effects and voices faithfully reproduced and mixed with as much punch as you can give the original elements.  I don't want to sound unenthusiastic; this is an excellent preservation of the material available.

Disc 2 is a DVD with extras, which are superficial but solid - in particular a profile on the exhibition company that originally released The Beyond in American (and its gregarious owner) is so interesting and entertaining that I wish it had been expanded to feature length.  Some more archival material would be nice (especially in regard to the movie's long history of censorship), but plenty of care went into the extras provided.

Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the Arrow Blu Ray is intermittently available in the US (usually at an exorbitant price) but readily available on Amazon.co.uk for around 9GBP - even with the exchange rate and international shipping, it only costs about 16-17USD.  Both the Disc 1 Blu Ray and Disc 2 DVD are region-free (including menus and intro materials) and play on my Region 1 equipment without issue.",1354492800,5,2000,5.180124223602484
8530905,5,B008VHYRMG,"While a lot of horror fans still swear by Lucio Fulci's great 1979 film ""Zombie"" as being his best film, I still feel that his 1981 film ""The Beyond"" is the late & great Italian filmmaker's best film out of his always interesting but also highly inconsistent filmmography. Prior to the release of ""Zombie"" (which was titled Zombie 2 in Italy and Europe to imply it was a direct sequel to George Romero's 1978 zombie classic ""Dawn of the Dead"" which was re-titled ""Zombie"" for European markets), Fulci was best known for his 1972 giallo ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" after a few years of directing gialli such as ""A Lizard in a Woman's Skin"" ""The Psychi"" in addition to a couple of spaghetti westerns too. But with the release of ""Zombie"", he became a bit of an international sensation and he also garnered an entirely new fan base of horror fans that were highly impressed and taken aback too with the over-the-top and graphic gore in the film that made a lot of people cring (I'm looking at you eye-impalement-on-a-wood-shard-scene!). He would parlay this into a series of even more violent splatter movies like ""City of the Living Dead"" in 1980, ""The Beyond"", ""The House by the Cemetary"" and ""The Black Cat"" (all 3 released in 1981) and ""The New York Ripper"" in 1982. Sometime after that starting with his horrible fantasy film and Conan ripoff ""Conquest"" in 1983 and the international backlash of charge of misogyny in the case of ""New York Ripper"", his fame and notoriety quickly cooled off and he spent the remaining years being viewed as nothing but a hack due to the huge drop off in quality of the films up through his death in March of 1996. In fact, his fame has actually grown even more since his death as newer generations of horror fans have re-discovered his films who for a long stretch were only available in heavily cut versions. Anchor Bay video had released some uncut DVD's of his most popular films including ""The Beyond"" and in the blu-ray era, Blue Underground here in the states and Arrow Video internationally have also re-released his best movies in hi-def too.

Arrow Video's blu-ray of ""The Beyond"" presents the film on a region free NTSC blu-ray that features a couple of commentary tracks and interviews too that are presented also in NTSC 60HZ format so the blu-ray disc should play in pretty much all North American blu-ray players. The only problem is that there is an additional DVD of extras that is in PAL format so unless you have a blu-ray player that can play PAL format discs and a TV that can handle a PAL signal, you'll only be able to play the blu-ray itself.

Their initial blu-ray of the film incorrectly had the prologue that was originally sepia toned in black & white instead and the film was on a single layer blu-ray with a low bit rate. These copies got released to a lot of international review sites and not many of them made it to market as Arrow quickly recalled those discs and re-released a new blu-ray of the film. This corrected blu-ray had the opening prologue back in a correct sepia toned format and also had a much better print of the film on a dual layered blu-ray and a much higher bit rate than the original disc.

The picture quality on the corrected blu-ray is truly leaps and bounds above any prior DVD release of the film and is truly like seeing the film again for the first time. Some have complained that the contrast is too high and the film too bright but I truly had no qualms on the blu-ray transfer and actually felt that in comparison, the old Anchor Bay DVD was dark and too murky overall. The film keeps a very high bit rate getting up in the mid 30MPS range and rarely drops any lower than around 25 MPS for the most part. Detail is truly astounding in this release and while there does appear to have been some DNR (digial noise reduction) applied to clean the image up a bit, it is never excessive and there is still a nice layer of film grain present. Colors are greatly improved and the detail on everything is truly amazing. The sound is presented in English 5.1 DTS surround as well as English and Italian language 2.0 stereo too. There are a couple of commentary tracks present too with the first being the great one from the Anchor Bay DVD featuring stars Catriona MacColl and the late, great David Warbeck. The track is highly informative and even though David was very ill at the time they recorded it, his spirits are high and they have a blast remembering filming the film and also how it was working with Fulci too who was known for being kind of harsh on women on his sets. The second features Lucio's daughter Antonella Fulci and Callum Waddell who works with High Rising Productions who were responsible for all of the original extras in this 2 disc set. It's much more dry and I really had trouble understanding Antonella a lot of times due to her very thick Italian accent but there is still nice information to be obtained from this 2nd track.

On the blu-ray disc you also get a 30 minute interview with actress Cinzia Monreale who played Emily in the film and also a Q&A discussion with star Catriona MacColl after a screening of the film in Glasgow. The PAL bonus DVD has an additional 2 hours of extras but since I can't play the disc, I can't advise what particulars these involve but I did read some other reviews that they focus on Aquarius Pictures who distributed the film in the U.S. under an alternate title of ""Seven Doors of Death"", a look at the special effects maestro Gianetto di Rossi who did the effects work on this film and others by Fulci. There's another 30 minute interview with Catriona MacColl and then another 30 minute one where other members of the Italian film community including Dario Argento weigh in about their opinions on Fulci and his legacy too. You then get the original trailer and also the pre-credits sequence in full bloody color too. I should also mention that the film is presented completely uncut and uncensored too!

Hopefully at some point I will get a blu-ray player that can somehow convert PAL format discs but this is still well worth getting for the NTSC region free blu-ray that houses the movie itself. It has truly never looked better and is a no brainer for upgrading your old DVD's in favor of this hi-def release. While the film might not make a whole lot of sense if you think about it too much, it is truly a triumph of style over substance and features a mood of dread that Fulci was never able to top either before or sense. Highly recommended!",1352073600,2,6505,4.528061224489796
