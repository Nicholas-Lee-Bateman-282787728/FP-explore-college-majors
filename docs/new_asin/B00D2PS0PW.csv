8588621,5,B00D2PS0PW,I ordered it on Amazon. It is in English and Spanish. A beautiful transfer. Cannot locate the Blue Moon distributor nor Absolute Distributors in Spain. It is for Region 1 too not region 2. Black & white and very clear picture. Looks like it may never be released on DVD by the Studio. It was Allied Artists.,1384387200,,307,4.4035087719298245
