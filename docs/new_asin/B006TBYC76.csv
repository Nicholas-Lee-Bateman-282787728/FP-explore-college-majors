5016167,4,B006TBYC76,"Although Rod Serling was, by the start of the third season of 'Night Gallery', disillusioned, and ready to move on, there was quality to be had from many of the story segments aired. Instead of the hour long, multi-segment format, the powers that be decided in their infinite wisdom to cut the running time to 30 minutes with only one segment. Also, Gil Melle's AWESOME theme song of season 2 is replaced with an inferior replacement by composer Eddie Sauter. But, I digress...
  The season gets off to a great start with the excellent 'Return of the Sorceror' with the great Vincent Price and Bill Bixby. Other excellent segments include Joanna Pettet and the late James Farantino in 'The Girl with the Hungry Eyes', 'Something in the Woodwork', with Geraldine Page, and maybe the best of the season 'The Other Way Out' with Ross Martin an absolutely stunning script, that leaves you breathless. The rest of the season is admittedly a mixed bag, but there are more winners than losers ('Rare Objects' with Mickey Rooney is another winner) In short, a mixed bag, yes, but enough good and great segments to warrant a place on your DVD shelf.",1328313600,40,1140,4.752525252525253
5016168,4,B006TBYC76,"As a child, I was always drawn to The Night Gallery because of its dark humor, macabre story lines and guest stars.  The coming attraction was matched by the crispness of the episodes and wonderful camera work.  Each had its appeal and lasting effect on me as a horror fan. I am thrilled that they are finally releasing the last season of this series.  I cannot wait.",1328227200,3,367,4.447761194029851

Not too many duds in this batch. Most of the episodes are really spooky and well done for its last year. Lets hope there are some good extras in this dvd set. Look forward to adding this to my dvd library and have the whole Night Gallery Collection. God bless Rod Serling for his insomnia for thats when many of his Twilight Zone script ideas came from and the same for Night Gallery.",1328140800,75,796,4.692857142857143

5016196,3,B006TBYC76,"Third Season is Second Rate compared to he first two. Cut down from an hour to a half for the third and final season, Night Gallery succumbed to a toxic cocktail of budget cuts, network interference, and a lack of cohesion between producer Jack Laird and Rod Serling. Ultimately the autopsy report for Night Gallery reads cancelled by network due to ratings, but the real reasons the show died after only 43 episodes are listed above.

Season 3 epitomizes the problems listed above; season 3 had only four scripts penned by Serling, 2 of Jack Laird's leftover moronic vignette's that were apparently too stupid to air during season 2 are used here, the lower budget is evidenced in cheap sets and special effects. With all the talent available on Night Gallery, the show had the potential to eclipse the Twilight Zone in terms of quality, but sadly only matched it on a few occasions. All of the classic best segments are found in seasons 1 & 2, with season 3 only producing only a few episodes that could even qualify as ""good"".  Spielberg basically tried to recreate the series in the 1980's with Amazing Stories, although well done, it never found its audience and was cancelled after 2 years.

The picture and sound quality are good and the bonus features ( 2 audio commentary episodes and a ""lost episode"" constructed from seldom-seen segments are very well done.

I paid $11.50 + tax for a used copy. Remember, there are only 15 half-hour episodes here compared to season 2 which contains 22 hour long episodes. My advice is to wait for a sale at Half-price books or buy it used off Amazon.",1469145600,,1596,4.669039145907473

5016225,5,B006TBYC76,Loved the Twilight Zone growing up so when this came out it was must see for me. A lot of it is dated and even at the time it was not as good as Twilight Zone (which is now also dated) but it was pretty good with some vignettes being excellent and others really bad. Rod Serling had grown tired of the whole medium of TV by the time Night Gallery debuted in 1969; he was less involved and basically just collecting a check to lend his name to the whole enterprise. He had done something like 159 episodes of the Twilight Zone over a 5 year period ending in 1964 so he was pretty much tapped out by the time Night Gallery debuted and unfortunately died shortly after it's 3 season run while he was still in his 50's. There are a lot of stilted attempts at humor that missed their mark even back in the day but it's evocative of an era and I still get a kick out of them. On the season 1 discs you can see Stephen Spielberg's directorial debut (Eyes featuring Joan Crawford) and you can see he was headed for big things even then.,1429833600,,1028,4.119402985074627

This was not the fault of Mr. Serling, but rather of NBC; the network cut the show from an hour to thirty minutes, limiting the program's story telling abilities, and its variety.  Some of the scripts here just don't measure up to that which you saw in seasons one and two. With that said, there are still gems of horror here to be enjoyed.  Hollywood greats Mickey Rooney, Chuck Connors and Vincent Price light up season three's marquee, and look for Ozzie and Harriet Nelson together again, and still having adventures as husband and wife in, ""You Can Come Up Now, Mrs. Millikan.""

5016272,3,B006TBYC76,"As the Night Gallery went on it diminished in quality.  The 3rd and final season, which took a near eternity for Universal to release, was cancelled so there isn't even a full season to watch and the show was reduced from an hour to 1/2 hour format.  The stories varry widely in quality.  The transfer quality is ok, the color appears a little faded which could have been improved.  There are some extras, but not many to speak of.  The first season wasn't a full season either, although the 2nd did have the usual number of episodes for a season done at that time.  Universal probably would have done better to have released the entire series in two boxed sets with some more extras--given the odd number of episodes.  The best shows of the series were early on when Serling had more creative control of the content.  I do have to give them credit though, for being able to restore the shows to the way they were originally broadcast, for the most part, instead of the bastardized chop job they did for putting the show in syndicatioin.

If you are a fan of horror anhtology series The Night Gallery is still worth watching--but only if you're a fan.  The feel of the Night Gallery is much more dated and different than the Twilight Zone (which has a timeless quality)--here we enter the realm of supernatural horror rather than the sci-fi/fantasy world of the Zone.  Frankly Ghost Story/Circle of Fear was a better horror series on a whole, but the anthology TV genre was on its way out by the time these rolled around and the decline in production values and writing is a good indication of that.",1405382400,3,1599,4.536585365853658

No longer an hour program, it was shortened to 25 minutes long.
  The theme music and intro changes again. Music by Eddie Sauther. Rod Serling did not have much control over the Night Gallery program and so the quality of the stories began to fail.

Leonard Nimoy and Kathryn Hays work together in ""She'll Be Company For You"". They were in the Star Trek episode, ""The Empath"" in 1968.

Leonard Nimoy directed ""Death on a Barge"".

Did you hear Rod Serling actually say the word ""disco-tec"" in 1972?

Disc One contains an audio commentary for ""Return of the Sorcerer"" with Night Gallery historians Scott Skelton & Jim Benson which can be turned on in ""Bonus Features"".

Disc Two contains ""Lost Tapes"" in Bonus Features.

 ""Die Now, Pay Later"" with Slim Pickens and Will Geer.
 ""Room For One Less"" with James Metropole and Lee J. Lambert.
 ""Witches Feast"" with Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Buzzi, Alison McKay and Fran Ryan.
 ""Little Girl Lost"" with Ed Nelson, Ivor Francis and William Windom.

Program in English with option of subtitles in English only.

Note: What is not in the Night Gallery DVD collection is ""The Sixth Sense"" tv series, with Gary Collins as the parapsychologist, ""Dr. Michael Rhodes"", originally broadcast on ABC in January to December 1972. For syndication in television, it was re-ran with the Night Gallery, however the one-hour episodes of ""The Sixth Sense"" was heavily-edited down into the 30-minute format of Night Gallery. Rod Serling added his own introduction to condense and explain the beginning of the story.

""The Sixth Sense"" tv series is not available on DVD. It would be nice to see the entire one-hour episodes which have not been broadcast in whole in over 40 years. They only made 25 episodes.

Rod Serling passed away June 28, 1975 having had several attacks including one on the operating table. He was 50. He was only 5 ft. 4.",1379808000,4,3223,5.735294117647059

I will say that the third season is the weakest of the three, and you can see the loss of quality in the show (not the DVD transfer).

Rod Serling's hosting was always he highlight and the paintings pared to the story is what made the show for me. At the time of first viewing(back in the early seventies) I was introduced to the world of art and that of macabre and good story telling. Understand that all of the shows where made in the seventies and have that seventies look(hair, make-up, etc) and it was made on a 1/2 a shoestring budget. It's the simplicity makes the story's shine that much more. They could do and try anything and sometimes it worked and other times it was not as powerful.

Never any blood or gore or filthy language that is on T.V. nowadays disguised as entertainment. The music score and those horrible paintings set the scene, and if you are the fingernail biting type of person, you might want to wear gloves, which of course, will make it difficult to eat the popcorn while you watch.

Season three had some things going against it from the 'suits' at the network, and some of the episodes were not very good, but they are small minority.  Season three had RETURN OF THE SORCEROR, SOMETHING IN THE WOODWORK, and many other strong episodes.  BUY THIS.  BUY ANOTHER COPY FOR YOUR FAMILY. :-)",1334620800,4,440,4.602564102564102
5016332,4,B006TBYC76,This release was long overdue for collectors. I was quite disappointed that Universal decided to go cheap and put the set in just a plastic case instead of the matching cases from Season 1 & 2. The DVD quality is wonderful and the extra eliminated episodes from Season 2 were great to finally have. Overall a terrific job and I'm very greatful to Universal for finally completing the series.,1334448000,7,391,4.681159420289855

5016334,1,B006TBYC76,"Despite Rod Serling's continued presence as host and script writer and a sterling cast of guest stars including Ozzie & Harriet Nelson, Sally Field, Dean Stockwell, Bill Bixby, Vincent Price, Stuart Whitman, Leonard Nimoy, and Geraldine Page, 'Night Gallery, Season Three' (originally broadcast in 1973) is simply awful.

The format has been altered from the previous two seasons, so that each episode contains a single 24-minute episode. Almost every script suffers from static shoe-horning; some plots are dragged out far beyond their potential, while others, like the underdeveloped and badly-executed 'Whisper,' seem abruptly curtailed.

Many, including 'Whisper' as well as 'Fright Night,' the inexplicable 'She'll Be Company For You,' and 'The Ring with the Red Velvet Ropes,' simply make no sense whatsoever or leave too many pertinent questions unanswered. For example, in and 'The Ring with the Red Velvet Ropes,' why does the Gary Lockward character have a vision of the boxer he's just beaten in the ring? How did he arrive at the mansion in question? Why is the alcoholic woman in 'Something in the woodwork' terrified of the ghost in her former spouse's body, when she's shown no fear of either the ghost or her spouse at any earlier point?

'Season Three' begins ominously with the flat and overtly predictable 'Return of the Sorcerer,' which was clearly produced on the cheapest, tackiest sets imaginable. Not even the sterling presences of Vincent Price and Bill Bixby can animate it or make it interesting.

One can only assume that most of the actors involved in 'Season Three' chose to participate due to the relatively high quality of 'Season Two,' which produced such excellent episodes as 'Brenda,' 'Pickman's Model,' 'Green Fingers,' 'Sins of the Father,' 'The Messiah on Mott Street,' the hilarious 'Professor Peabody's Last Lecture,' and 'Secret Snow, Silent Snow,' all of which, with 'They're Tearing Down Tim Riley's Bar' from Season One, come as close to being minor 'classics' as the show ever produced.

The general impression 'Season Three' provides is that the producers knew that the show was being cancelled before the shooting of the first episode began, and thus hackneyed, unchallenging stories were adapted, every script was forced into production with the minimum of thought or editing, the flimsiest sets and most inexpensive special effects were utilized*, and the first take was used in each case. Every episode feels like it was created in clockwork fashion, with all expertise, skill, and genius left at the door.

Even Gil Mell's stunning, wholly electronic score from the earlier seasons is replaced with music far more vapid, and the highly effective opening title sequence has been replaced as well.

Admirers of Serling can only imagine what he must have felt during production.

* The gorilla costume used in 'Hatred Unto Death' looks exactly like the one used ten years earlier in 'The Beverly Hillbillies' arc in which Granny forced a maid's costume on a gorilla (actually a man in a costume hired by Mr. Drysdale), gave it a feather duster, and put it to work cleaning the Clampett mansion.",1334275200,25,3143,5.1611001964636545
5016335,5,B006TBYC76,"I just received my Season 3 of Night Gallery the other day. After being a fan of the incredible Twilight Zone of course I had to start working on getting Night Gallery. I have only watched a couple of episodes so far because I just received my Season 3 copy. But I am very pleased with what I have seen. The episodes seem to take the Twilight Zone to increased heights. Dwelling with supernatural issues like ghosts, witches, Demonic issues as well.  It's also great to see the old actors and actress' of that time period of Night Gallery which makes the set worthwhile. Bill Bixby and Vincent Price to name a few. Now that I have season 3 , the other Seasons won't be far off to purchase. Why did I wait so long to buy this? I'll never know but it won't be long until I have the whole set.",1334188800,5,790,4.197368421052632
5016336,4,B006TBYC76,"Always lingering in the shadow of ""Twilight Zone"", ""Night Gallery"" never received the love or critical respect that Rod Serling's first TV series received. Serling gave up creative control for ""Night Gallery"" hoping he would work less unfortunately that wasn't often the case as he would battle producer Jack Laird and others at Universal to insure a quality series. Although Sterling's name was above the title (so-to-speak), ""Night Gallery"" was as much writer-producer-director Jack Laird's show as it was Serling's.

The third season of ""Night Gallery"" still managed to have a number of classic episodes even though they were sometimes fewer and far between compared to seasons one and two.

Universal has done a stellar job with the transfers for the third season (much as they did with the second). The show does look soft on occasion but the overall presentation is quite nice. Image quality is surprisingly good with nice detail and although the colors are a bit subdued by modern standards, that's the look of the show itself and was pretty typical of early 70's TV shows.

The mono soundtrack sounds nice and clear although there is some dullness that creeps in on some of the ""lost"" episodes simply because they had to use a variety of sources for the sound to complete them.

Subtitles are in English (SDH).

The special features include commentary tracks from Scott Skelton and Jim Benson who run TV Time Machine. Both Benson and Skelton worked with Universal to reconstruct the ""lost"" episodes from season two. Many of these episodes were ""lost"" because they were radically recut (""Die Now, Pay Later""), couldn't be located ""Witches Feast"" (which comes from a pristine beautiful looking 35mm print), have footage restoredthat never aired ""Little Girl Lost"" and also includes the short ""Room For One Less"" all with commentary tracks by Skelton and Benson discussing what happened to the episodes and how they were restored.

All of the extras and effort that Skelton, Benson and Universal put into this two disc set bumps it up from three to four stars.",1334016000,25,2065,5.005830903790088
5016337,5,B006TBYC76,"I'm Jim Benson, co-author of the Night Gallery book with Scott Skelton. My production company TV Time Machine Productions and Scott, worked with Skip Martin of Universal Studios Digital Services and Universal Home Entertainment in the restoration of the ""lost episode"" for this DVD set (featuring the segments ""Die Now, Pay Later,"" ""Room For One Less,"" ""Witches' Feast,"" and ""Little Girl Lost""). Because of the complicated history of this series, sometimes there's some confusion. In the early 1970's, Night Gallery was heavily altered for syndication. Cut into half-hours, some segments were expanded with footage from other TV Shows and movies--totally unrelated to Night Gallery. Other segments were edited down drastically in order to meet time requirements for syndication. In the case of ""Die Now, Pay Later,"" ""Room For One Less,"" ""Witches' Feast,"" and ""Little Girl Lost,"" we worked from the original shooting scripts and from original studio notes, restoring these episodes to their original states, as intended by the original filmmakers back in the early 1970's.",1333929600,268,1071,5.457831325301205
5016338,5,B006TBYC76,"Season three is worth buying for one and I think the best episode of all the
seasons of night gallery THE RING WITH THE RED VELVET ROPES.",1331856000,5,137,4.111111111111111
5016339,5,B006TBYC76,"For those of us who are fans of the Serling's series ""Night Gallery"" we could not be more thrilled at the news that the third, and final, season is finally being released. We waited forever for the first season to ever be released. That occurred in 2004. Then we waited it seemed a life time for the second season to be released in 2008. It then seemed like an eternity before the word came out in 2012 the third season was coming out. The final season of ""Night Gallery"" is not the best, especially compaired to the second season but there are still some excellant episodes with a few big named actors appearing in what was probably the last of the great anthology series that use to be found on television. The sadness to all this was that NBC decided to cut the series down to only a half hour show and then cancelled it halfway throught the '72-'73 television season. The executives at NBC I guess didn't have a clue just how great NG was and probably couldn't comprehend the genius of Rod Serling who is and will always be to me the greatest writer for televison.

There were 15 episodes during the last season of NG. Among the better stories I think are  THE RETURN OF THE SORCERER starring Vincent Price and Bill Bixby,  SPECTRE IN TAP-SHOES starring Sandra Dee, YOU CAN COME UP NOW, MRS. MILLIKAN starring Ozzie and Harriet Nelson, THE OTHER WAY OUT with Ross Martin and Burl Ives and FINNEGAN'S FLIGHT with Burgess Meredith. Some of the other big name actors that appeared in the third season include Mickey Rooney, Leonard Nimoy, Chuck Connors, Dean Stockwell and Sally Field.

Also included is the missing story from the second season that was missing from the season 2 DVD set. It has been a true concern from ""Night Gallery"" fans far and wide if WITCHES' FEAST would be found and added to the season three set. Well it is official. It has!!! It has been added with three other episodes to create a ""lost Episode"".",1330300800,11,1926,4.510028653295129

In any case, this takes me back to when my family would watch it on the old t.v. I look forward to watching this & the fond memories of yesteryear. Thanx Amazon.",1329696000,6,417,3.9176470588235293
5016341,3,B006TBYC76,"By the third season of Night Gallery, the network had cut its running time to thirty minutes rather than sixty--which left the show's creative team much more limited in how they could pace the vignettes. Tensions between writer/face-man Rod Serling and workaholic writer/producer Jack Laird had gotten worse than ever, and the show's use of the cheap-looking ""day for night"" technique--in which outdoor scenes were shot in daylight and then filtered to unconvincingly appear as ""nighttime""--had reached an all-time high. Season three had several meandering episodes that barely held together a narrative thread (""Whisper"" and ""Death on a Barge,"" for example), and of the seventeen stories that originally aired (fifteen episodes), two are useless vampire puns (courtesy of Jack Laird, if I recall) and another two focus on killer animals (a gorilla and a jungle cat) rather than ghosts or monsters.

There are, however, two standouts that remain some of the best episodes of television to ever bear Serling's name. The first, ""The Other Way Out,"" is a compelling tale, through-and-through, about a man who gets his comeuppance after murdering a ""go-go dancer"" and seemingly getting away with it--until he is lured to an isolated farm by a potential blackmailer. The second truly great story, ""Finnegan's Flight,"" sees Burgess Meredith in his second and final Night Gallery appearance as a prison inmate whose imagination is so vivid that he can push the limits of the human mind's capabilities--and possibly bend the rules of reality.

Other good stories that would have been better as 20-minute pieces of an hour-long show, rather than 30-minute stories stretched a little too far, include ""Fright Night,"" about a man who inherits a house with a mysterious, locked chest in the attic, and ""Spectre In Tap Shoes,"" a murder mystery with a (possible, I don't want to ruin it) supernatural twist.

As a whole, season three of Night Gallery cannot hold a candle to the superior season one, which was short but with a high batting average of quality, or season two, which had many, many classic episodes due to sheer volume. Most episodes do have that unquantifiable ""Night Gallery feel"" that viewers crave, however, and ""The Other Way Out"" and ""Finnegan's Flight"" alone make this set worth owning.

Completist fans will also be happy to know that ""Witches' Feast,"" in its entirety, is included in this set as part of a ""lost episode"" that was recently compiled. See the episode list below for the other three vignettes included in the ""lost episode.""
