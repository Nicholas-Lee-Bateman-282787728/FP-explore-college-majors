490844,4,630265873X,"Long before Sean Connery accepted the Best Supporting Actor for 1987's THE UNTOUCHABLES, he'd already proven himself to not only be one of the 20th Century's biggest movie stars but an actor capable of immersing himself in a role with the best.

I'll always believe that it was Connery's conviction as an actor that helped make the James Bond movies resonate so strongly with the Sixties moviegoing public.  No matter how outrageous the situation, you believed it because he believed it.  He quickly grew bored with the role as the scripts began imitating themselves and sought other roles to better define himself as an actor, not a movie star (as if being one of the biggest movie stars in the world was such a bad thing!).

Connery's talents are all on display in THE OFFENCE, a Sidney Lumet-directed film about a cop who goes over the edge.  The film takes you into the tortured mind of a police detective who's seen too much, a big man not quite big enough for the corrosive overall effects of hunting down a child killer.

Most of the film takes place in an interrogation room as Connery plays a cat-and-mouse verbal game with a suspect who may or may not be his man.  The result is fatal to the suspect and fatal to Connery's psyche.

It doesn't look like this film is available on DVD yet in the United States but it has been showing on cable TV channels.  It's well worth watching to see great performances so check it out if you get the chance.

I think my favorite Connery performance is THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING in 1975.  Bottom line is: he's always good.  In THE OFFENCE, he's great.",1214438400,11,1597,4.506944444444445
490845,5,630265873X,"Anything directed by Sidney Lumet is worth considering. This is one of his very best. A dark and disturbing story, featuring two brilliant performances by Sean Connery and Ian Bannen. Its no coincidence that 'The Hill' from eight years earlier was also directed by Lumet and featured Connery and Bannen.

Connery is Sergeant Johnson a Policeman who after twenty years of dealing with murders, rapes and other violent crimes has had enough. Bannen plays child molester Kenneth Baxter who Johnson has to interrogate. His interrogation is brutal and Johnson starts to doubt whether he is any better than the man he is interrogating. This is a grim and depressing film throughout, yet somehow its one that always surprises me when I see it again. I think this is down to Connery's massive screen prescence, although it helps to have one of the best Directors as well of course.

This is only a 15 on DVD in the UK, but some may find the subject matter and general downbeat nature of the film off-putting. If in doubt I would rent it first.",1192752000,6,1035,4.712707182320442
490846,5,630265873X,"The Offence tends to have been relegated to a trivia question these days (what was the film United Artists agreed to make as part of their deal to get Sean Connery to play Bond in Diamonds Are Forever?). On some levels it is dated, but the power of Connery's truly extraordinary performance is undiminished. A man almost totally morally decayed by the horrors of the job who sees something he recognises in himself in the suspect in a series of child-rapes (an almost equally impressive Ian Bannen), with terrible consequences, it's a ferocious outpouring of anger and contempt crying out for help he simply won't accept. The eternally under-rated Sidney Lumet's direction is bold and cinematic despite the theatrical origins (the play Something Like the Truth by Thunderball co-writer John Hopkins), the film's dulled palette mirrored by the half-finished grey concrete of the modernist police station: with its large windows looking out at pure blackness, it's more a reflection of the character's state of mind than an attempt at a realistic representation, but it's an entirely appropriate arena.

The R2 disc, like most of MGM/UA's European releases, sadly contains no extras even though footage of the rehearsals exists and occasionally turns up on documentaries, but does boast an acceptable widescreen transfer.",1145750400,8,1319,5.251184834123222
490847,5,630265873X,"This film was incredibly neglected in its historic context . The camera - eye goes through the screen directly to the crime scene : A Federal Agent has exceeded his ethics principles in order to get a confession when , in the middle of the interrogatory certain details will get out of control.

The admirable flashbacks employed by Lumet allows us to rebuilt all this conflictive puzzle. The sum of so many memories has been burrowing the emotional equilibrium of this efficient agent : the horror , the impotence , leads  him to a serious isolating process characterized by an evident lack of communication with any other person . The frenetic discussion with his wife confirms the statement . He seems to be possessed by a febrile obsession : all or nothing is his inner philosophy .

Few times Sean Connery had been required with  such level of expressiveness  Ian Bannen is superb too as the suspect man.

490848,3,630265873X,"THE OFFENCE was a not entertaining film about whether or not Sean Connery could act.  I would rather have been watching ""Waiting for Godot.""  Lumet's directing was as hopeless as a non-Scotsman trying to tune a bagpipe. He spent too much footage on the abstract, the inexplicable, and a yen for night photography.  Poor Trevor Howard gave it all she had as the wife or mistress of drunken, uncontrollable Detective Johnson [Connery]. Lumet's penchant for unresolved flashbacks added nothing to the film's entertainment quality, nor added very  little to the psychological measure of nasty Johnson.  To top off the film's irritation,  the sound track was bad requiring me to make several on-the-spot reviews of errant dialogue.

I knew he could act through the smirks and savoir faire of  James Bond and other big movies but the roles always lesser than the  surrounding spectacle.  'The Offence' finds Connery in a stripped-down,  rough little movie that pits his detective against the late Ian  Bannen's  child molester suspect.  The battle of wits breaks only to look at the  cop's equally distressing marital life.  Yes, a tough one to watch but  marvel at the sheer power of Connery's performance as the driven yet  ambivalent detective.

490927,4,630265873X,"Perfect for director Stanley Lumet's style and approach to material ""The Offence"" also gives Sean Connery a terrific opportunit to show off his acting chops and shrug off the image of 007. Originally Connery had difficulty getting this adaptation of John Hopkins (who also wrote the screenplay opening it up quite a bit)play backing. Connery agreed to star as 007 for ""Diamonds Are Forever"" on the condition that United Artists support two moderately budgeted films of his choice and donate his substanial salary to charity. As cool and controled as Connery was playing 007 the year before this was shot, Johnson is all explosive emotions.

SPOILERS:

This dark drama features Connery as a police detective John Hopkins on the trail of a serial child molester. Once Johnson nabs his suspect things go awry during his interrogation. Hopkins is burned out so much so that his superior (Peter Bowles- ""The Avengers"" TV series among many other projects-who is curiously revoiced by another actor)has begun to doubt Hopkins' decisions, choics and abilites to judge his suspects. When they pull in suspect Kenneth Baxter (Ian Bannen-""Waking Ned Devine""), Johnson becomes unhinged.

END OF SPOILERS:

Lumet who did such classics as ""Price of the City"", ""12 Angry Men"" and ""Network"" brings his unwavering critical gaze on the corrosion of the soul that dealing with the worst sort of criminals can do eroding the morality of a normal man. Lumet's approach here is no frills as was often his style--no stylized action scenes glorifying violence and designed to make the audience root without thought for the good guy. ""The Offence"" deals in shades of gray whether it be a man pursuing justice for innocent victims like Johnson or he attacker.

The transfer here is acceptable although it appears to be an older one (perhaps the one used to prepared the original DVD). Colors are washed out (a deliberate choice although they could be a bit stronger with a proper restoration--there are some scenes here with the color saturation is so weak that the scenes are one step away from black and white. That could have been Lumet's choice but it's hard to tell with him no longer around. I didn't see this during his theatrical run in 1973). Detail is pretty good throughout and this is a very clean looking transfer from a very nice (if faded)interpositive. The film could certainly benefit from a restoration (and it wouldn't be that expensive given how goo dthe source material looks

The audio sounds fine. The original mono is presented without any enhancement. It should be noted, however, that Kino has chosen not to include subtitles for this film. Given that the audience for this film is likely a older one, that's a mistake. The languages only include English so this is a bare bones presentation.

We don't get any speial features beyond he trailer which, unlike most modern trailes, doesn't spoil the entire film. Sadly, Lumet passed away in 2011 and while Connery is (at present) still wit us, I don't know that he's interested in doing any commentary tracks.

For those interested that can play region B discs, the UK release is the better value as it comes with new interviews with production crew discussing the making of the movie and an excellent 36 page booklet. The transfer is the same although with a higher bit rate and slightly stronger colors.

I doubt that there are any vintage featurettes that were produced to promote the film (United Artists did minimal promotion of the project and it didn't even make back its $1 million budget in theaters). It might have been nice to have a featurette that detailed the production of the film (or a commentary track from someone knowledgable about the production of the film, Lumet or Connery's careers, etc.--hey Kino I work for plane fare if you're looking or someone).

A solid but unspectacular presentation of a dark, minor classic, ""The Offence"" isn't a huge improvemet over the DVD release but detail is improved as is depth with some nice textures evident at times. The audio is solid doing exactly what needs to be done for the film no more or less. It would have been nice to have subtitles, a commentary track or short featurette on the production of the film but I doubt that Kino had the budget for it since the company is licensing this project via Fox (who handles MGM/UA home video releases).

""The Offence"" is a dark ride and glimpse into the psyche of a burned out detective trying to make sense of his world. I recommend it but it is a harrowing film to watch.",1426982400,5,4531,4.826030927835052

490930,3,630265873X,"""The Offence"" (1972) was a well-acted Sidney Lumet directed story that kind of misfired for me because the film told its story too ambiguously, while leaving one with a lot to think about, but it is, upon second and third viewings, cloudy.  It remains cloudy about things that should be very determined while watching the story unfold.  I was surprised at Sidney Lumet who consistently knows how to tell a story.  That includes the very misunderstood ""The Appointment"" with Omar Sharif and Anouk Aimee.  That film was designed to be ambiguous, almost like a Chinese puzzle, but with ""The Offence"" we really do not have a protagonist as the film tries to give creditability by their very humaness, despicable traits so and the ambiguity never clarifies our doubts.  Granted, every hearing in a court of law does not guarantee that justice is always served.  Otherwise the film is outstanding.  Sean Connery and Vivien Merchant are stellar and Ian Bannen, who appeared with Connery before in ""The Hill"" (1965) (also directed by Sidney Lumet) (one that I have not seen), I have never seen better.  (I wonder when we will get the chance to see him in 1965's """"Mister Moses"" starring Robert Mitchum?)  ""The Offence"" was put out on MOD at first, and this very good Blu-ray presentation by Kino Lorber, while affordable, does not have many extras.  It was based on John Hopkins' play ""This Story of Yours.""  The film is intelligent, but I don't know what it is that I was supposed to get from it.

490933,2,630265873X,"Very depressing movie about an out of control cop (Connery) who can't seem to repress his desire to commit the lurid sex crimes he witnesses the bad guys commit.  What bothered me most was to see Sean Connery act really wimpy in a scene where he literally gets down on his knees and begs a criminal for counseling - not only does this begin to stretch the limits of credibility but we just don't want the man who plays James Bond to look like he's clutching for his teddy bear.  Director Lumet does do a good job of creating that neurotic personality which seems ubiquitous in English culture even if it doesn't make sense to us Americans. In our culture a naughty cop like this would just go out and find a woman to have SM sex with and be done with all the frustration and guilt.  I always try to find something worthwhile in any film I don't like and for me it was fun to see Sean in his prime acting as an English cop who's a real bully (except in the one scene where he's a real wimp).  Not only does he beat the bad guys up but he steals their food.

As others have pointed out it was Connery's character who actually raped the little girl which may have been the directors veiled message but this fact is so heavily obscured by the directors confusing style that it becomes somewhat lost and perhaps maybe even irrelevant.  Actually at one point when watching the film I did consider the cop's guilt but once again after enduring the director's heavy syrup of obscurity I dropped that idea.  Normally I would watch the film again with this idea in mind but this movie doesn't seem to deserve that much attention.  Whatever the facts are the most prevailing aspect of the film is its depressing atmosphere that makes life seem like a walk through Dante's Inferno.",1406246400,5,1769,4.404907975460123

Connery gave the million dollars to charity and asked that The Offence be financed.  Oddly enough I understand that Connery never did request that UA finance that second film.  It's unlikely that this film ever would have seen the light of day otherwise as well.  Here, Connery gives one of his best performances.  The film came out in 1973.  I saw it in Los Angeles in 1978 or 1979 when it received it's ""Southern California Premiere""; perhaps that is why Connery was never nominated for an Oscar for his perfomance, because maybe no one from the Academy had a chance to see the film back in 1973.  One of the darkest films I've ever seen with many incredibly eerie scenes, this movie is not for everyone.  It concerns the hunt for and capture of a child molester.  The essential conceit of the movie breaks down at the end however, because the movie suggests that Connery's inner demons are the result of the terrible things he has seen as a police officer, but I did not accept the idea that those memories could have resulted in Connery's specific pathology as the film strongly suggests.",1312243200,,1252,4.6289592760181
490979,4,630265873X,"THE OFFENCE is a tight, taut, gripping drama of psychological suspense that showcases what may be Sean Connery's finest performance. He plays a police inspector whose perception of the world, and his part of it, has begun to fall to pieces after he's seen one bit of brutality too many. The always remarkable, always underrated Ian Bannen plays a suspect in the abduction of a schoolgirl who proves too much of a match for the disintegrating sergent in the interrogation room. Sidney Lumet made many films on many wide-ranging subjects, but always kept returning to crime, law enforcement, and the justice system for his strongest, best-wrought films. Here his viewpoint wavers between the objective and the subjective, creating a visible tension. The camera is so much inside the sergeant's view for so much of the film that we feel the space of the frame straining with its effort to get outside of his nightmare. Lumet did some of his best work with Connery. This film stands with THE HILL as two of the finest works of both the actor and the director.",1310947200,2,1055,4.802197802197802

His role harkens back to a similar one played by Clint Eastwood in the underrated ""Tightrope"".  Where the film lets down is in the shockingly lackluster direction of Sidney Lumet and a script that doesn't evolve very far from it's stage origins.  The key word here is staginess.  Lumet didn't know how to open this film up for the big screen and it never really takes off.  The film is watchable but with the material and the starpower on hand you wonder what might have been.

490982,5,630265873X,"England, 1973: Detective Sergeant Johnson (Sean Connery) is a hard-bitten veteran of some twenty years in the police force and one of the lead detectives working towards the capture of a serial child molester who is menacing the satellite town which he calls home. Johnson is an abrasive man who is barely able to contain his simmering resentment towards his lack of promotion, superiors whom he considers to be witless, and a loveless marriage. His inherent animosity towards the world is driven to breaking point when he crosses swords with Kenneth Baxter (Ian Bannen), an erudite, successful family man who becomes a suspect in the investigation. Over the course of one night, events come to a violent head whilst Baxter is in police custody; but what precipitated the violence? And what was the real motivation behind the offence?

""The Offence"" is an important film for two reasons: Firstly, it was one of the first widely released theatrical films featuring a major star to deal with the subject of child molestation (and it's consequences) in a populist medium; and secondly it is one of about three films where the audience is treated to the sight of Sean Connery ACTOR rather than Sean Connery MOVIE STAR. For my money, Connery is an actor who, Post-Bond, really coasted through the majority of his career playing a caricature of his 007 persona and who only ever really flexed his acting chops in two films - ""The Offence"" and ""The Hill"", both of which were directed by the late, great Sidney Lumet. Personally speaking, this film pips ""The Hill"" (which is similarly brilliant) to the post for me because Connery as an actor expresses a degree of emotional vulnerability and psychological fragility that we were never to see again. It's fairly apparent to me, that Post-Bond, Connery was attempting to slough off the skin of Ian Fleming's character once and for all, and his bravery as an actor here is formidable. His thinning hairline is, for the first time in his career I believe, exposed to the world for all to see and the charismatic sang-froid of Bond is nowhere to be seen beneath Johnson's moustache, Sheepskin jacket, hat and bilious tirades of blunt invective.

But there is far more to this film than just Connery's performance. The screenplay, brilliantly adapted for the screen from a stage-play by John Hopkins, remains to my mind the most disturbingly eloquent and subtly brilliant examination of a man succumbing to what we would now call ""post-traumatic stress disorder"" (and gaining a devastating insight into his own distasteful psychosexual predilections in the process?) that has ever been committed to film. It is all the more impressive because it is told in a decidedly abstract non-linear style in which the audience first observes the aftermath of the offence itself without context; then the context of the situation; and finally the devastatingly catastrophic interrogation that immediately precipitates the offence itself.

Lumet as a director perfectly captures the soullessness of England's then burgeoning 'satellite' new towns  - vast, monolithic, semi-industrialized estates of Corbuserian office buildings, clone homes, motorways and underpasses which were constructed in the Home Counties in order to house the overflow population of London - using a drab pallet of rainy greys, caustic strip lighting, and shadow. No other film has ever rendered the experience of living in one of these towns so effectively; and I should know, as I actually grew up in the town in which this movie was filmed; my mother worked at ""the school"" (in reality a retirement home) at which Connery and his men stand vigil at the beginning of the film; the block of flats in which Connery lives with his wife were a stone's throw from our house (the building is  called ""Point Royal"") and I whiled away many a happy hour as a child/teenager in the town library which doubled as the exterior of ""the police station"".

Lumet's use of the image of a light in the interrogation room as an aesthetic motif for the theme of insight that recurs throughout the film (""in this room you discover something like the truth about yourself"") is inspired, and a bravura (and disturbing) sequence in which we are treated to a brief glimpse of the tortured memories that plague Johnson's mind as he drives home remains devastatingly effective.

""The Offence"" is the kind of film that, for the most part, just doesn't get made any more by big budget studios that are more interested in pandering to the lowest common denominator in pursuit of big bucks than telling an original story. It's intelligent, erudite, understated, subtle and profoundly disturbing; and if you want to measure the degree of it's influence, you need only compare a scene in this film - in which Connery's wife (Vivien Merchant) grows to regret her demand that he ""open up to her"" when he proceeds to reel off a catalogue of the barbarity, violence and inhumanity that he has witnessed on the job - with a very similar one that appears in Michael Mann's excellent film, ""Heat"".",1277683200,4,5058,4.9575471698113205
490983,3,630265873X,"First let me say that this is a boring movie. It reminded me of ""The Conversation"" in tone though plots are a lot different. Both movies were made in '74. Both movies got lots of good reviews on Amazon. And neither were very entertaining - rent before buying is my suggestion - I can't imagine anyone sitting through it twice. At the same time, there are moments of interesting psychological study that may be rewarding for those that care to put the time into studying it, though prerequisite would be you don't fall asleep while watching it - harder than it sounds.

So what is this movie about? It's basically about a cop who kills a suspect during interogation and as the murder is being investigated we glean how far the cop has sunk into a world of his own demons - he sees the accused in himself to the point where we suspect that he is almost accusing himself - his punishing of the prisoner seems linked somehow to his own feelings of guilt. And as we're brought back through the interogation that led to the suspect being killed (mostly a long conversation which seemed meant for the stage), we learn how just how far off the deep end he's gone. It's a brave film on one hand, the screenplay tackling a man fearing the worst in himself, so much so that he has become unhinged and is becoming the devil he fears, even more fearsome because he's the cop.

While it sounds interesting perhaps, the reality is that ""The Offence"" is incredibly slow - and not just because of gratuitous slow-motion shots, but because the dialogue is extremely monotonous much of the time, occasionally bordering on melodramatic and the plot gets old fast - of course you may not know what the plot is really about until the end of the movie - and even then..

A mixture of 'pacing problems', murky cinematography and picture quality.. but then you get the feeling this movie never sets out to be 'entertaining' in the traditional sense; more like it's out to take up where Freud or Jung left off.  Add to that that it is mostly shot in darkness and shadow, appropriate to the subject matter of a cop slipping into mental darkness, and you're not in for a ""thriller"" in the traditional sense of the word, but more of a character study, a study of madness, a study of human nature even.

It may be more interesting to think about the movie than to watch it. I'm not a huge Sean Connery or Sydney Lumet fan and this film didn't make a convert of me, though I could understand it being considered brave for it's subject matter and Sean Connery brave for taking on the role - a pretty dark one. A man losing himself to his own dark potential. ""I know you,"" he says to the suspect.",1269734400,2,2663,4.437627811860941
490984,3,630265873X,"Finding out this movie was adapted from a stage play answered a lot of questions for me.  The film feels very much like a play.  It rarely moves from one room to the next, and the majority of the film feels like one long conversation.  My wife, bored within the first few minutes, continually walked in and out of the room and she commented on how it felt like the movie was one never-ending scene, beings that she always seemed to see the same thing upon reentering the room.

I'm not saying that this is a huge issue, but there are times when the film can seem redundant because of that.

Sidney Lumet is an extraordinary director, I won't ever deny him that.  I personally don't feel this is his best effort, and I found the film to be lacking in a few areas, but there is no denying that Lumet tries gallantly to make this work.

The film opens with the aftermath of a brutal attack.  This is not the type of attack you'd expect though.  It opens with Detective Sergeant Johnson brutally interrogating Kenneth Baxter, a man suspected of child molestation.  After this opening sequence we are taken back to before the attack so that we can see what led up to Kenneth being taken into custody, and then it skips right over the interrogation to show Johnson adjusting after the attack.  Only after we see his moral collapse do we get to see what all happened inside that room.

Personally I found that Connery anchored this movie, and without his presence the film falls flat.  Thankfully he's in most of the film.  I've always enjoyed Sean's work, but he's never truly been taken seriously as an actor.  I found his Oscar winning performance in `The Untouchables' to be weak, and so I've always been slightly baffled that that still remains his ONLY nomination, when you consider his superb work, especially during the 70's.  This performance in particular was stellar.  He really captures the haunting realities of working in this field.  He portrays his characters mental deterioration and emotional crumbling to perfection, especially in that final interrogation scene.  I also enjoyed his severity in which he conveys his feelings to his wife.  He really got the seething nature of his profession.

Aside from Connery (and a rather remarkably unsettling turn by Ian Bannen) though, I found this film to be a little stale.  I don't know how to explain the feeling I got when the film ended.  It didn't leave me with any real lasting connection.  Sure, Connery was effecting and he really elevated the film, but in the end the film doesn't feel like anything remarkable at all.  It just feels like a film, plain and simple.  It's a decent way to pass the time.  True, it could have been edited a little better.  There are scenes that seem to drag on and there could have been a little more character development in areas, but overall I cannot say this is a waste of time.

Watch it for Connery, and expect a lot from him because he delivers; but don't expect this to be a film you'll want to watch over and over because it's simply not that film.",1237248000,4,3050,4.575645756457565
490985,5,630265873X,"A small English film, well done and many other things, but the interest is not in the plot because we know from the very start who the rapist is. But the whole interest of the film is how the rapist does not know he is one, does not remember his crime and how his memory is going to come back little by little, though it will take him killing another - at least - man who managed to see through his official innocence.

That shows how being a rapist is a very special crime. It is a secret crime that happens in the deepest depth of one's mind and of which the rapist himself is not conscious, though his subconscious, when it takes over to guide him through the crime, is extremely well organized and makes him do exactly what is necessary for him to succeed and to go through it without any problem or opposition.

This subconscious is also strong enough to make him forget about the crime entirely so that he does not have to hide anything since he does not know any more, though he does not need his torch in the night to go back to the girl in the woods, and her reaction confirms in our eyes the fact he is the rapist even if he is trying to comfort her now.

And yet that subconscious is trying to hide the tracks of the crime by looking for an easy scapegoat who would in a way or another accept, willy-nilly or unwillingly if necessary, to be the surrogate rapist. The transfer of another transfer, and that is the beginning of the fall of the rapist because he will become a criminal of his own. And we are set wondering how it is possible for a criminal of that type to mislead his surrounding co-workers or even relatives and acquaintances into believing he is an innocent good man.

How can crime hide so well and so deep in a man's deeper layers of his personality? Apart from that tricky psychological side of the film, it is rather simple and uneventful. But just try to imagine how he is going to realize he is the rapist and how the people around him are going to realize he is the rapist. And we can only have a flitting picture of what he did to the various witnesses or people who are in his way to leveling the witnesses into the ground. Quite a bloody trail.

7828857,4,630265873X,"Spoiler alert  this review presumes you have already seen the film.

Another of Sidney Lumet's good-cop/bad-cop-in-one-person movies.  Detective sergeant Johnson (Connery) loathes the pedophile (Baxter, played by Ian Bannen  ""Jim Prideaux"" in ""Tinker Tailor"") not just because of what he does to little girls.

Both men hate to be touched, but don't mind touching.  And more.  It's strongly implied that if the suspect is guilty of committing ""The Offence,"" so is the copper, at least potentially.  He can all too easily  despite his horror  put himself in the other man's shoes.

So when Baxter tells Johnson, ""I know you,"" he's spoken his own death sentence.  The suspect dies because he reveals that he knows the policeman's mind intimately.  In killing Baxter, Johnson tries in vain to do away with the part of himself that he hates.

It's sort of like in ""M"" where the organized underworld figures understand the child-murderer (Peter Lorre) all too well, such that they are on the verge of forgiving him at the end.  Or killing him.

Here it's not just the architecture that's brutalist.  This film is more than dark, it's pitch black.  The cop-who-can't-leave-it-at-work clich is taken to excruciating lengths, making it at times hard to watch.  ""Midsomer Murders"" this ain't.

7828858,4,630265873X,"In spite of its poor production values and low budget, this is a wonderful showcase for Sean Connery's dramatic talents.  The issues here are important and complex - very psychological, and Connery is up to the task.  Who ever thought he was a real actor?  As a detective chasing down child molesters, he comes face to face with his own inner demons and propensities, and gives such a powerful performance.  Trevor Howard as his superior and Ian Bannen as the perpetrator give excellent performances as well.  This is really more of a stage play than a movie because it mostly revolves around the dialogue and the visuals are not much to look at.",1463184000,,646,4.68141592920354

7828860,5,630265873X,Dark and somewhat hard to follow but a classic early Sean Connery movie. Adding Trevor Howard to the mix only added move value to the movie. Being filmed in England you can see the differences in how the British and the Americans deal with crime. I think it probably displays a very true to life view of how things were done in England in the 70's.
