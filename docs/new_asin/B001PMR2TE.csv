I would recommend this movie for mystery lovers.",1365984000,,128,4.818181818181818
8333830,1,B001PMR2TE,Low budget is one thing...laughable is another.  This is a total joke.  Stop reading this review and move on to the next movie.  Not worth the blank DVD it was copied to.  They spent more money on the DVD box cover than filming this abomination.,1264377600,,245,4.377777777777778
8333831,5,B001PMR2TE,"A bunch of friends go GPS hunting in search of a couple million dollars that they are lead to believe is stashed in the woods... instead, they dig up a small coffin. Inside are photos of a some lady who is tied up and masked. Coordinates written on the photos indicate her location. Real or a game?

GPS is a fun, indie thriller. The first half sets up the mystery and the second half is very fast-paced. It's not very gory so it's not really a horror movie (more of an ensemble thriller ... and a bit of a mystery, as you can try to guess who the killer is as the story unfolds). There are also some stunts that are impressive for the budget. A long list of detailed special features explain the filmmaking process, so the bonuses are interesting.
In addition to a Director's Commentary, the bonuses include these segments (most 20 minutes or longer):

8333832,1,B001PMR2TE,"(1.) Typical woods and stream - if you find this walk in nature exciting you must live in Detroit (sorry Detroit, I had to pick a city - it could have been any other city).
(2.) Typical cheap hand held cameraman walking with hikers.
(3.) Very typical someone in the woods is killing people only in this case the camera work and suspense and actual killings were juvenile and ho-hum beyond belief. Fast forward to save time and find another movie to watch.
(4.) Acting? To call it acting is a leap in desperate defining.
(5.) The geo cache angle is analogous to someone in a chicken custom in front of a mattress store - attention grabbing for 3 seconds.",1246838400,,653,4.45
8333833,2,B001PMR2TE,"I've read the other reviews, and I've seen the movie, and I'm underwhelmed. The problem with the movie is that I've seen essentially the same thing a dozen times. Yes, the GPS angle is somewhat novel, though I have seen it before (in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Are-You-Scared-2/dp/B001LXIDV8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Are You Scared 2</a>, which is admittedly a more recent film and not as good as this one), but all the GPS idea (i.e., a bunch of people searching for a buried prize as part of a game) really does is provide an excuse for the young cast to end up in an isolated place. After that, this is a standard horror film in the vein of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Know-What-You-Did-Last-Summer/dp/6305017115/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Know What You Did Last Summer</a>&nbsp;or most of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th/dp/B001NPD9LS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th</a>&nbsp;franchise: a masked killer is stalking young people and killing them.

It's a shame, too, that the film lapses into clich since there is potential here. The cast is generally good. The scenery is great. The overall look of the film is good, too. And the first discovery in the woods, a coffin with a series of disturbing photographs of a possible victim, is an intriguing touch. But the film quickly becomes a by-the-numbers exercise and ends up with one of those denouements in which the killer confesses and explains everything without a particular reason to do so.

If you're new to horror films, this one might be interesting, but if you've seen quite a few, I recommend giving this one a pass.",1242259200,3,1753,5.9800796812749
8333834,5,B001PMR2TE,"This indie film is suspenseful and fun to watch.  I'm pretty sure that this is the first full length feature film with a story line based on geocaching.  Kind of amazing considering how popular the sport has become.  The movie is about a group of friends who embark on a GPS treasure hunt.  They find themselves in the middle of the woods, and in the middle of a whole lot of trouble.  What is really amazing about this movie is that all of the stunts were executed in real time.  Some stunts were even performed by the actors themselves.  Behind the scenes bonus features reveal this fact, as well as how the stunts were done.  I found the special features (two hours worth) to be every bit as entertaining as the movie itself.",1238889600,3,728,4.421052631578948
8333835,4,B001PMR2TE,"There is nothing about this film that lets on that it was made on a shoestring budget. It is beautiful to watch (the Washington State wilderness makes an amazing backdrop), and the actors and action are top-notch. A clever concept and a well written script breathe new life into the thriller genre, and the film successfully blends chills and humor into a thoroughly enjoyable film experience.

The extras are where we learn how little the filmmakers had to work with, and how much they accomplished with it. It is one of the most in depth lessons on the process of independent film making I have ever seen, and a cut above the usual cutting room add-ons you get with most DVDs.",1238457600,3,678,4.603305785123967
8333836,4,B001PMR2TE,"Great indie suspense movie with extras about how-to-do low budget indie films.

The movie itself is great fun.  But the extensive extras about how it was made and how someone should go about making their own low-cost indie film makes it a very special package.

Don't miss this one!",1238284800,2,282,4.714285714285714
