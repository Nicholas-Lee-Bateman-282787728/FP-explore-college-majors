3747497,5,B001PKHS18,"This set of five DVDs is a must-have for people who love to travel and who have been, or want to visit, Rome and the Vatican. The series was presented on PBS and presents over seven hours of content. It is the most informative documentary produced in full cooperation of the Catholic Church I have ever seen and is completely up-to-date with the latest Pope and what the Catholic Church faces with today's realities and its challenges. It has fantastic videography and the narration is very helpful, although the narrator translating into English what the people speaking Italian are saying is rather difficult to understand at times.  The first disc is a preview of the entire series and gives a taste of the content of each DVD.  A disc menu tells you what is being covered and lets you choose which component you want to see next. You are taken behind the scenes of life within the Vatican City-State, some of the history of the Catholic Church which explains some of the traditions, the routines of life in the Vatican, discusses the Swiss Guard and their life in the Vatican, shows the life of the alter boys who live in the Vatican, shows the use of media--print, radio and television, and discusses the symbolism of some of the frescos that I had never really understood or the underlying allegory being presented in the various artworks.  It also shows the painstaking restoration of textiles, statues and the frescos of the Sistine Chapel.  One of the most astounding secrets is the excavation underneath St. Peter's Basilica seeking the bones of St. Peter--this secret was known by very few people while it was going on and the DVD shows some of the actual excavation and what was found.  I highly recommend this set to everyone, and you do not have to be Catholic to marvel at the beautiful artwork commissioned by and maintained in the Vatican for centuries.  It is a fantastic bargain at the price and is a keeper in a video library.",1247184000,24,1946,4.69208211143695
3747498,5,B001PKHS18,"During our recent trip to Rome, like most tourists,  we shopped for a DVD of the Vatican to bring home. As you would imagine, there were many versions, and each more expensive than the other. So,we decided to wait until we returned and look for one on Amazon. Once again, Amazon did not disappoint us. This DVD is a wonderful, informative, pictorial visit to St. Peters' and the Vatican. Statues, places, and things that we were so fortunate to see, are once again revisited on this DVD.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone planning a visit to Rome, or anyone who wishes that they could.",1244073600,22,596,4.5607476635514015

8333453,3,B001PKHS18,"If there was a 1/2 star rating for me I would give this 3 1/2 stars, but since there isn't then I gave it 3 stars.  I'm comfortable with that becasue while it has outstanding and beautiful photography of and around The Vatican, at times it is more for promotional tours than actual history and ""secrets of The Vatican"".  Some of the stories of this DVD series are VERY interesting especially about St. Peter ""the 1st Pope"" and how his remains were discovered in the ""grotto"" below the main altar at St. Peter's Basillica in 1948.  Other topics are good as well though they take too long and instead describe the walls, flowers, and some non-necessary details.  I supppose I was looking for more historical facts about the Vatican then this had.  That is okay.  It is not a bad series, and it is informative, I was excited when I ordered it and kind of disappointed after viewing it.",1323993600,4,882,4.515723270440252
8333454,5,B001PKHS18,"Having a huge online cyber travel guide to Rome and Vatican City [...] and having been to the Vatican many many times, I have seen this on my local PBS station and it is an excellent addition to anyone's collection.  Very informative and it truly makes me want to head back to Vatican City (and Rome) right now.  I highly recommend this to anyone who loves the mystique of Rome and Vatican City.",1309996800,,395,4.397260273972603
8333455,4,B001PKHS18,"This was an item which I anxiously wanted to be enjoyable as it was a birthday gift for my 87 year old father, who is italian and very intelligent, he loves to read and learn about ancient times especially when it has to do with Italy.
Well this item was perfect, the viewing was expectional and the verbal was clear and very understanding for an elderly man.

I was most impressed with the visuals and how it depicted the vatican city and it's artworks.

It was especially informative when relating to the explanation of selection of a new pope.  This was fantastic.

I give it a 10 out of 10 love it.",1255392000,13,602,4.348214285714286
