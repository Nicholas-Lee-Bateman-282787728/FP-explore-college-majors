1241927,5,B00000K1S3,This video takes me back to the great times I spent in Hawaii and the sweet memory of my engagement proposal on the beach in Maui.  The sunsets are so real and the sound make you feel like you really are there.  You have to see it to believe it.  Amazing!,984528000,4,255,3.9607843137254903
1241928,5,B00000K1S3,"This video makes my husband and I want to go back to Hawaii for another honeymoon! I can almost feel the warm waves lapping at my toes and smell the sea breeze again. The colorful sunsets are so soothing. I highly recommend this video for anyone wanting to 'experience' Hawaii. It is truely a romantic dream, especially when viewed in the bedroom!",983232000,4,347,4.612903225806452
1241929,5,B00000K1S3,"I love all the Waves videos. Hours of continuous peace. We never thought we'd feel it again! As a care-giver for my handicap dad, these tapes are our salvation. Powerful real medicine. Fastest way to distract him from  pain without using meds. Quick way for mom and me to meditate, relax or  escape. For anyone these tapes are the ultimate stress reducer with  immediate results. Instant mood altering for ones whole environment, giving  hours of peace whether you are sitting in front of it or not! Any of these  videos are a good investment, and gift especially for those on limited  budgets.",961027200,5,594,4.7745098039215685
1241940,5,B00000K1S3,"Just relaxing in front of the TV with the sound of the waves in the background and the magnificent Hawaiian scenery not only reduced my blood pressure, but when the weather is gray and cold it lifts my spirits to a new level.",1232323200,,225,4.255813953488372
1241941,2,B00000K1S3,"I don't know what I was expecting, but this was hardly what I'd call a virtual vacation.",1163116800,6,88,4.235294117647059
1241942,4,B00000K1S3,"I bought this DVD along with another as part of an anniversary day.  I received and reviewed the DVD with pleasure.  The folks that made the DVD did a great job of picking unoccupied beaches and nice locations.  Both video quality and sound were excellent.  Looks great on a big screen!  My only complaint is that they didn't spend longer at each beach, but they did cover every island.  Worth the money.",1125014400,4,404,4.541666666666667
1241943,5,B00000K1S3,"This gorgeous DVD helped me very much with my insomnia, because it just has the sound of the waves and beautiful beach scenes of different varieties-- there's a black sand beach, white sand beaches, scenes of midday and plenty of AMAZING sunsets... all from many different Hawaiian islands.  I grew up on Oahu and of course travelled throughout the islands so I think the choices will surprise people who have travelled in Hawaii, are from Hawaii, or who have always wanted the chance to go there.  There aren't any hokey touristy vistas (so in some ways it's better than actually being at the famous beaches), or the intense crowds.  These are exceptional beach choices that you may have never seen before, but none of the scenes are boring either.

There's just enough to listen to and look at like a lone person in the distance, one bird that waddles into the scene and begins entertaining itself by the waves, or the waters swirling and breaking around rocks so that it begins slowly deepening and then lulling you into tranquility.  For anyone who has slept by the sea you know how healthful it can be.  Again, I recommend it for someone suffering any health conditions and insomnia as well, like myself, and I've been using it as a background for meditation which I particularly enjoy.  You can turn the subtitles on or off which tell you what the names of the beaches are and what island they're on, and you can loop the DVD automatically so that it runs endlessly through all of the scenes.  You can skip to your favorite day as well, for instance if you wanted the last day's particularly beautiful sunset.  The ""Hawaiian Dreams"" doesn't have any pop-up ads that I've seen some people write about.  Maybe the Zen ones are what they're referring to?

I lucked out b/c I bought it from the director and my first DVD was damaged, maybe in the mail.  He immediately replaced it and wished me a Happy Mother's Day.  I have to say that he had great customer service and quick deliveries but it's the product that I've really enjoyed.  I'm waiting for the Caribbean and will probably buy more beach DVD's.  I read that he's doing a nature trail version which I hope is true.  I would love a gentle rainstorm DVD too.",1115942400,14,2218,4.591370558375634
1241944,5,B00000K1S3,"I found this DVD to be outstanding. Actually, I now own two of the Virtual Vacation series (Carribean Daydreams, also). What a great mind-calming tool. After about 20 minutes of watching Carribean Beaches, I felt like I'd taken about 3 Zanaxes. What's really cool is that I find myself able to ""go to"" a particular beach scene later in the day, when I'm getting stressed from from outside sales job. I recommend this DVD 100%.",1111795200,7,426,4.693333333333333
1241945,1,B00000K1S3,"I will never buy one of his DVD's again.  To have the audacity to throw in a quick blurb about the website and what ""day"" the vacation is on, DURING the program is unacceptable.  He ruined my ""vacation"".  I still cannot believe they have this ""pop-up"" type of marketing taking place during the video.  There are many other choices out there when it comes to relaxation and nature DVD's.",1108598400,19,386,4.550724637681159
1241946,5,B00000K1S3,"I wasn't sure about how much this director's cut was going to vary from the original, but it was obviously different within the first few minutes of watching.  It's sharper and more colorful than the original version, and I like that I can flip the subtitles off when I don't feel like seeing them.  The loop-play feature is definitely cool.  I've never seen that before on a DVD.  Much better than the original.",1103241600,2,412,4.602739726027397
1241947,5,B00000K1S3,"I am watching this DVD even as I write.  I love it, to be honest.  It's so artfully done that, when seated near my TV monitor, I'm tempted to extend my foot and wiggle my toes in the lustrous, lapping waves.  I knew I'd hit paydirt when I happened on Greg's work while cruising relaxation disks right here at Amazon.  Until then, I'd doubted ever finding such elegant simplicity, only the real deal, sights and sounds of pristine beauty ... period.  Being frazzled since birth,  I was familiar with the standard relaxation fare.  I enjoyed it, to some degree at least,  but it got so that the 'elevator music' in the background was spoiling the experience.  Whether it was Mantovani or Bach, it wasn't enhancing.  It was annoying, distracting.  And it was everywhere.  But then I encountered what for me amounted to perfection:  nothing but real Hawaiian vistas, in this case, with the endless waves as background sound.  Once in a while a gull might glide through the frame and utter its haunting cry  (which DID enhance the experience), but nary a violin for the entire, uninterrupted 'virtual vacation' to this planets most shining visual jewels.  I think it might even be an improvement on going there ... because it is so easy and trouble-free.  No airport body searches.  No fear of flying.

Greg Voevodsky does all the work from Molokai to Kauai, Lanai to Maui, with Oahu and Hawaii filling the bill.

I keep mine close to my DVD player or IN IT most of the time.  I just hope DVD's last as long as they say they do!",1102118400,6,1523,4.566666666666666
1241948,5,B00000K1S3,"We have all of these DVD's from the whole series and we love them. We have LCD panels in each room of our home connected to a centralized DVD-changer, and we basically just loop through all of the discs day-in and day-out. We literally have them on from wake-up to bedtime, every day.

The newer DVD's have less of the graphics some find intrusive, and there's supposed to be a ""director's Cut"" version of the earlier ones coming out in the Fall with no graphics at all.

Still, the fact that the DVD's have no narrative, corny music, or overlaid text (brief intermission text aside) - plus the fact that they loop - are what makes them unique. I've found nothing at all like them, and there are definitely worth getting - especially if you have a plasma or LCD panel where you can just keep it running all day. It's truly like a window view from the beach house most of us (me included!) will never afford.

(Yeah, and for those who DO have beach houses, or live on Maui, well, yeah I suppose you have a right to be critical when comparing these to the ""real"" thing, but c'mon! Think of all the folks in Kansas :O)  The rest of us NEED these DVD's!)",1093392000,4,1150,4.310185185185185
1241949,5,B00000K1S3,"If you just can,t be there but you still want to  escape to your favourite hawaiian beach this is the next best thing!  This video will defintely leave you feeling relaxed.  You visit six islands including kauai,oahu,molakai lanai,maui and finally hawaii itself.  It has beautiful daytime scenery as well as colourful sunsets!  I also own the Hawaiian zen video as well.  It is equally as beautiful!  I have just purchased the carribean dvd and i,m lookin forward to it as well.  Aloha!",1089676800,2,486,4.841463414634147
1241960,5,B00000K1S3,"If you are wanting a documentary filled with breathtaking arial footage of the beautiful Hawaiian Islands, you'd better look somewhere else. This is, and I repeat, a relaxation DVD! There is nothing exciting about it, but it is perfect if you are wanting to play something soothing while you doze of to blissful slumber on a quiet winter evening. It has still footage of five different beaches on each of the six main islands, separated into separate ""days"" for each island. Each day has at least one beautiful sunset shot. The shots are ussually about 2 minutes long so you are not stuck with same shot for 15 minutes like some relaxation DVDs. All told, you won't find a better relaxation DVD of the Hawaiian Islands anywhere else, I've looked! So if that's what your looking for, you've found it.",1076284800,,799,4.714285714285714
1241961,5,B00000K1S3,"My wife and I just returned from a 14 day vacation to the islands. The first thing we commented on was how much we missed the ocean sounds and tropical feeling we had enjoyed during our stay.  Hawaiian Dreams allows us to enjoy the serenity of calm ocean waves lapping up on the beach, just like we remembered.  Sometimes we just leave Waves running in the living room so we can hear the ocean in the distance.  My wife wants to get the new ""Caribbean Beaches"" and if it's anything like this one it's an easy decision.
I saw a review where the person must have been looking for an IMAX tourist guide instead of a tropical relaxation experience.  While it may not be as sharp as IMAX, that doesn't mean its not pretty, and its definately twice the resolution of VHS. I guess if I were looking for a Hollywood blockbuster film on the Hawaiian Islands I would expect that sort of production.  However, if you are looking for beautiful scenes with natural tropical stereo sound, not 'artificially' mixed surround sound and no cheezy overdubbed elevator music, then Waves is just the ticket.  Enjoy!",1070841600,8,1094,4.584615384615384
1241962,1,B00000K1S3,I was very unsatisfied with this DVD. The picture quality is very bad and the sound really does not even come close to the real deal. I have purcahsed other relaxation DVDs and this one is by far the worst. I wouldn't recomend wasting your money on this one.,1067385600,5,258,4.285714285714286
1241963,5,B00000K1S3,"I love this video!  Unlike so many others, this one doesn't show scenery with music or narration, just the natural sounds of the areas. Incredibly relaxing, visually beautiful; it's perfect for those times when I feel the desire to visit Hawaii but can't just up and go. This is not a tourism video, and anyone who buys it for that reason probably won't care for it. I have already ordered several more videos from the company, and am looking forward to seeing the rest of their work.",1061337600,2,484,4.563218390804598
1241964,5,B00000K1S3,"This DVD is wonderful! It brings me back to when I first visited the Islands. The scenery is beautiful, especially the sunrises and sunsets, and the sounds of the waves are so soothing and relaxing. There are so many colors -- the green mountains, the puffy clouds, blue and purple sky, the warm sand, and the crystal clear green and blue water.  It makes me want to jump in. Once I turn it on, I can't stop watching it!",1054080000,,420,4.3164556962025316
1241965,5,B00000K1S3,"I have now watched H.D. (Hawaiian Dreams) in total or part for the 13th time.  I still find it so well done.  The entire production value is top notch.  The sound is sensational, the waves and sunsets hot, there are even birds that fly along the beach.
I even loned the DVD to my mother who was recuperating from a hip replacement surgery.  She was not recovering very well, two weeks after surgery. So I droped off the product hoping she would watch it, and relax a bit.  She was very down about her slow recovery, losing interest in her Physical Therapy. She tells me the scenic sights have given her a new healing quality to get back on her feet and to give her P/T. a 100 % effort.
I want to say thank you for such a possitive relaxzation product, that not only helps me to relax  after dealing with hundreds of customers all day, but for giving my 72 years old mother a re-newed sence of healing and such a positive perspective.  I recoment this Video to anyone young or old, and enjoy the waters, the sounds, the sunsets, and the nature as it is presented.",1053993600,3,1062,4.306532663316583
1241966,5,B00000K1S3,"What a great DVD. The scenery and photography are incredible. It is the perfect de-stress solution after a hectic day. If you are expecting a surfing video, you may be disappointed, but if you want to see and hear some of the most beautiful spots on the Hawaiian Islands presented in a relaxing format, you will really enjoy this DVD as we have. It has also given me some great gift ideas too! Thanks Waves!",1053820800,,407,4.44
1241967,1,B00000K1S3,"I'm an ocean lover, scuba diver and a meditator; I love the ocean; I wanted to see waves; I was disappointed.  I really wanted what this DVD said it would deliver - a mixture of interesting waves in spectacular settings with natural sound.
The waves are small and uninteresting; the settings are only average by Hawiian standards. This could have been so much better.
The only value of this video is if you use it in meditation to occupy your visual attention - ""to zone out""
And this purpose is mostly defeated by the irritating logo and audio that appears between each segment to remind you of the Name of the DVD and company that made it.
The production values are mediocre; you could produce this yourself. It is not even a good reminder of what it's like to sit on a beach, because the view rarely shifts and chances to capture sunrise/sunset are missed.",1053043200,10,859,4.541935483870968
1241968,5,B00000K1S3,"Thanks to you guys at Waves! These videos are excellent. Having just returned from Hawaii and wanting to keep the memory of a romantic vacation alive, I bought the CDs and I'm glad I did. Judy and I really enjoy watching the videos together when we relax. The shots are incredible and the timing is perfect, each scene flows like water into the next. Very relaxing, I will definitely be getting the whole set for my family.
Thanks again,
Jon",1043884800,2,441,4.525
1241969,3,B00000K1S3,"The shots of Hawaiian beaches are nice, but the editors don't really give you a chance to relax because they cut the shots way too frequently. I mean hey, it's relaxing to sit for awhile on the beach. Jumping to a different beach every 3 minutes or so...that's not that relaxing.",1042588800,6,279,4.490196078431373
1241990,5,B00000K1S3,"After visiting the islands many times, I find this video a great contribution to the beauty of Hawaii. The beauty of the sunsets, that you can only view on the islands are fully captured here, the calm sound of the ocean is more then enough to sooth your stressed mind and soul. I have viewed this dvd on our 61 inch Big Screen with surround sound. I had a virtual trip to Hawaii, without the hassle of packing and flying for many hours. So Peaceful!!!!!
Thank You Greg for helping this stessed out city dweller, who was raised by the sea, come home again. I know what my friends and family are getting for gifts this year, for many years of enjoyment and stress relief,,,,,,
These videos are totally awesome. I have wanted to be home by the ocean again, and enjoy the beauty and peace of the sea, but life has not permitted it at this time. I have found the closest thing tho now. What a blessing!
I have bought three of these videos, and there is no favorite one. I suggest you get them all. They are so relaxing, you can almost smell the salt air.
If you want to relax, enjoy beautiful ocean scenery, seagulls, sand and surf, these are the best!!
You will not be disappointed.
Believe me I have prayed that I could find something to get rid of the stresses living in the city, and to just relax by the ocean shore, and now I have my answer. These video's take you to the most beautiful shores, where you can sit back, read, or listen to your favorite music, and not have to shake off the sand.
A beautiful work of art, this man has captured the beauty of nature.
So if you want to relax and enjoy~
I highly recommend WAVES!!

1241991,5,B00000K1S3,"I bought the whole collection, and they are excellent!  The natural sights and sounds are really soothing and relaxing.  I gave copies to a couple family members for Christmas last year, and they were a real hit.  My wife likes to watch the waves while running on the treadmill, and it gives her the feeling of running on the beach in Hawaii.  It's the next best thing to being there.
I will definitely be giving this DVD to my friends for Christmas this year!",1037145600,2,460,4.440476190476191

  But otherwise this is a great DVD.  The tranquility will make you forget about the minor drawbacks I mentioned above.  The fixed camera angles and lack of music really lets your mind wander off and enjoy a virtual trip to the Hawaiian islands.  Soak away your stress with this DVD.

1241995,5,B00000K1S3,"This is one dvd I can't quit watching. I've already watched it six times since I got it. Hawaiian dreams features 6 islands 11 minutes each of ocean veiws from each island. Most of these waves are of the lapping kind though on some islands they get big toward sunset. My favorites are day 4 on Lanai and day 5 on Maui. Day 4 features heavy waves surrounding you with rocks in between and miniture waterfalls coming off the rocks as the waves crash into them. This was shot number three. Day 5 on Maui features big crashing waves. Each island ends with a beautiful sunset over the ocean. I beleive I saw it sink below the water in one of the islands. The picture on most of these islands is pristine and sharp. The details in the waves are deep blues and whites. The dvd brings out the reds in the sunset and also the deep blues in the sky before sunset. Also on certain islands you can see rocks and sand far away from the ocean suddenly get submerged by waves which pull back out again. Their is very few sea gulls in this one but you do see one every so often. The sound is in dolby diginal surround and sounds great on a tv surround sound speaker system. This dvd is so relaxing it can cause you to go to sleep while your watching it. Total running time is 74 minutes of ocean views. Dvd features  include loop play,instant island access thru chapter search and previews of the other vacation waves series.(...)",1018569600,3,1414,4.315789473684211
1241996,5,B00000K1S3,"For years I have looked for ocean videos, but they all had music backgrounds. I wanted just the wave sounds.  I did find a DVD where one could isolate the natural sounds,but unfortunately the picture had jiggling problems. So I about gave up until I discovered Hawaiian Dreams--perfect picture, perfect natural sound. I watch a 27"" TV with a 37"" magnifier, which gives kind of a 3D quality, and since I am not aware of the TV behind the magnifier, I seem to be looking through a window out at the sea--my own virtual ocean view window without all the troubles of being on the real oceanside, not to mention the expense! The DVD picture seems so real that I actually feel like I am there. Also I can change the view out of the window with a click of a button! Though, thanks to the DVD repeat function I usually just let the same view play on and on. And by adjusting the TV controls, I can change the time of day or night, such as looking at the ocean under moonlight. Wonderful! Am so looking forward to getting the rest of the Wave series--Hawaiian Zen, Californian Dreams, and Californian Zen. They will soon be available in DVD I am told. So will have even more ocean views through my ""window."" After many years of searching I finally found what I wanted. Thank you, Powerfloe (the Publisher).",1014336000,6,1297,4.449579831932773
1241997,5,B00000K1S3,"This DVD has been virtual bliss for me, here in NY.  It's been a wonderful gift to be able to escape and enjoy the Hawaiian waves and sunsets. It's natural bliss.  If you're expecting a quick music montage of Hawaii's beauty, this is NOT your video. However, if you really want to relax and experience Hawaii's natural beauty - virtually - this is it!
All six islands are captured in their own unique ten minute segment.  Spend a few minutes with each non moving, non zooming shot, just sitting there.  Listening to the waves, and letting your mind wander... Without quick 'Hollywood' editing, you are invited into the shot to relax and admire mother nature's rhythm and flow.  Each segment consists of 5 shots lasting a few minutes each, capturing a complete day ending with a marvelous sunset. It truly is a 'mindmassage'  meant for you to just relax, do nothing, and be! (I have been so relaxed that I have drifted off to sleep. That's really a blessing considering everything.)
Much more soothing than a fishtank or fireplace, you'll be gratefully transported to a far off land of peace and beauty.  Play your favorite CD: Enya, Pure moods, smooth jazz, whatever?! for a completely different - but still lovely - experience.  Share this wonderful gift with your friends and family.

It looks and sounds like you're really sitting there on the beach, listening to the waves, watching the sunset, and feeling completly at ease... Best of all, it can loop continuously so I can let it run for hours... dreaming...  I'm vacationing in a beautiful 5 star hotel.

It was suppose to be a Christmas gift for friends who enjoy Hawaii tremendously. How do you think they would like to see the carribean instead. I'm thinking NOT !! I really have no use for this Carribean DVD but I seem to be stuck with a purchase that I absolutely don't want. I would appreciate if Amazon would please send me the DVD I purchased and send a prepaid shipping envelope so I can send this one back to you. This was my second experience shopping on line with Amazon.com and depending on how this issue is delt with will tell wether I will be shopping again. Thank You, Miss Natalie Maddalena",1261094400,,887,4.349397590361446
