Although it is dedicated to the ""13 Roses"" (there is a good Spanish movie about them, ""Las trece rosas"") and the title recalls a phrase written by one of them -Julia Conesa- to her mother in her last letter, it shows testimonies about other victims of Franco's abuses.  I met Ms. Concha Carretero in 2011:  she was then a 94-year-old strong and nice woman, still commited to Republican values, and with words and mind as clear as a sunny day!",1364860800,,660,4.6239316239316235
