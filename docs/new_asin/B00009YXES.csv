7994629,5,B00009YXES,"I'd seen this several times before but wanted my own copy for personal reasons. This film is cheesy, but to be brutally honest, most surf/skate/snow flicks are. The soundtrack is bad, the editing is terrible, and Davis jumps randomly back and forth between different subjects and sports. But if you know what to expect and you're a collector of sorts then it's a rare must-have. My copy came with a $1.99 sticker on it and a small scratch on the disc. Neither are a big deal.

This has surfers Bruce Irons, Andy Irons, and Sunny Garcia in their surfing hey days, as well as Mike D. from the Beastie Boys doing a skit with skateboarder Steve Berra. This is a lousy movie that doesn't survive the test of time but it's the little quirky things like having all these people in one film that makes it a collector's piece. Just watching Berra rap surprisingly well to MC Hammer's ""Can't Touch This"" or listening to the all the injuries suffered by the motocross guys makes it worth a few bucks. It's available for free on You Tube. Come back here for your own copy.",1510444800,,1060,4.492227979274611

7994632,2,B00009YXES,"Cute, kind of scattered, but the interviews were nice. Music was fun.
The problem I had with this is all of the ""cool"" shaky cam, shot strobe, filler garbage. It gave me a headache so I turned it off about midway through. I think they were trying to make it seem more action-y by putting all of that annoying flashing and spinning crap, but they only succeeded in making an otherwise decent sports documentary/comedy into garbage.

Nice try... but fail.",1424476800,,453,4.6625
7994633,4,B00009YXES,It was fun to see the beginning of freestyle motocross and compare it to were it is now . I love that stuff,1393804800,,107,3.6956521739130435
7994634,3,B00009YXES,Pretty cool video.  Nice that each persons part has some interview sections.  The video is pretty dated however.  It would be nice if there was more to chose from on amazon for this genre.,1392854400,,188,4.470588235294118

7994637,3,B00009YXES,"After reading the post from Ryan Cragon, I felt compelled to write my own little review of this little film.

Directed by Beastie Boy Mike D's wife Tamra Davis (Billy Madison, Half Baked, CrossRoads), this film dives into the world of extreme sports - motorcross, bmx, skateboarding, snowboarding and skiing.  While the pacing of this movie seems a bit off, jumping from skiing to motorcross to bmx to skateboarding to snowboarding to surfing, this film lumps the sports together by similarities.  seth morrison says he's influenced by motorcross, next sport is motorcross.  travis pastrana says he's influenced by bmx, next sport is bmx.  Pretty simple.

the soundtrack was pretty amazing, i thoroughly enjoyed that aspect of the film.

The film is a good intro into extreme sports, with some of biggest names representing their sport.

The little skit that runs throughout the movie is cute at best.  it gets a couple of giggles here adn there and is an okay filler. I'd say this is 3.5 stars.",1124064000,,995,4.910179640718563
