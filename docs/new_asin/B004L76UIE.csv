8433911,3,B004L76UIE,It was way to much money for this DVD. Found it at Wal-Mart for $10.00. Also one of the sounds on the cover didn't work.,1307404800,,120,3.84
8433912,5,B004L76UIE,"This DVD is really a lot of fun for everyone in our family!  I have to admit that I was skeptical of this DVD, but my son LOVED the packaging - because he loves Chugginton, and there are buttons on the cover that play the songs from Chuggington.  We walked around the store with him carrying the case and playing the songs....which actually sold me on the DVD.  The songs were catchy, not annoying - like many kid DVDs can be - and the stories are cute and have a nice message.  I worried that maybe my just-turned 5 year-old would be too old to enjoy the stories, but both my 5 and 7 year old will ask to watch Chugginton in the car, and we all sing the songs together.  Perhaps this DVD will not be exciting over time, but it has been a hit at our house for the 3 months since we purchased the DVD.  I recommend checking for lower prices - I think we paid around $15 for this at the store.",1306886400,,891,4.034090909090909
