8099159,5,B000CK16RE,"I watched this cartoon series as a child and I remember it very fondly especially this version of Snow White, I just love the Anime style art, and recently I've been trying to find a (legitimate) version of this series on DVD, but of course it's out of print in the US I don't understand why it's out of print? it seems like everything is on DVD these days, even old black and white classics films are on DVD so why not this cartoon series? all I've been able find are imported versions that obviously won't play on US DVD players

I'm so Disappointed with a capital ""D"" that this series is not on DVD in the US sigh! I guess the makers of this series underestimated how much kids would love it I was one of those kids, and I still love this cartoon as an adult

It's just too bad that all that's left of this series are poor quality imports and VHS tapes, and sadly I no longer own a VHS player, sure I could still purchase one, but why? most of my film collection are in DVD and blu-ray format, in fact I prefer DVD or blu ray over low grade VHS because there's no worries of type unraveling and with DVD you get a better picture quality and they last much longer then VHS, though I'm still tempted to buy this VHS because I haven't had any luck finding a US version of this lovely cartoon.

Well if you don't mind VHS and enjoy Nippon animated cartoons you'll most likely love this cartoon it's so fun to watch a great cartoon. I hope someday soon they put it on DVD in the USA I'll be first in line I to get it, and I'd keep it in my collection to watch and share with my little niece.",1315958400,3,1589,4.086538461538462
