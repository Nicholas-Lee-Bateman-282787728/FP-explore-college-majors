5685939,3,B00C1LIYTU,"Disney should stop releasing random DVD's of their shows and release complete full seasons. I would LOVE to buy complete seasons of old-school Disney Channel shows but everytime, you get a DVD with 6 or 7 episodes which is annoying. Come on Disney, do it.",1365811200,44,255,4.688888888888889

5685955,5,B00C1LIYTU,"Making it in the music biz is very hard, but with Austin and Alley, they're going to the top.  It is great for preteen and teen children.  They can dance with the DVD with Austin and Alley.  Austin's the extroverted musician and singer.  Alley is a brilliant but very shy songwriter.  But after Austin performs Alley's song in a video that goes viral, the two combine their talents.  The two and their good friends chase after their dreams and have hilarious adventures.  I recommend this Disney Channel Movie to middle and high school age children.",1377043200,6,549,4.71578947368421
