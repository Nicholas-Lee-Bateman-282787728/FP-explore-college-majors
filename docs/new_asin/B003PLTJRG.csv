4164752,5,B003PLTJRG,"Calvin Marshall is a charming, funny, independent feature written and directed by Gary Lundgren.  I agree with others that this is the best performance of Steve Zahn's career.  Absolutely love the soundtrack scored by John Askew and featuring wonderful indie music talent: The National, Rosie Thomas, Jandek, The Church, The Sound, and Tracker. Starring Alex Frost, Michelle Lombardo, Steve Zahn, Jane Adams, Andrew Wilson, Diedrich Bader, Jeremy Sumpter, Abraham Benrubi, Josh Fadem.

4164753,5,B003PLTJRG,"I love this movie! Can't recommend it enough  - beautifully rendered, artfully crafted, and the perfect balance of comedy and bittersweet - far better than anything spoon fed out of Hollywood.

And you don't have to take my word for it . . .

""Lundgren's screenplay beautifully juggles the story's alternately comic and poignant elements and renders all three main characters with surprising depth."" Hollywood Reporter

""Lundgren has a light touch and a weakness for wistful indie lullabies; it is the former that gives this classic coming-of-age film its distinctive ring."" - Village Voice.

Check it out.",1284681600,2,606,5.206185567010309
4164754,5,B003PLTJRG,"This film was exceptional. Calvin Marshall, who is played by actor Alex Frost is a really special character. His endurance and perseverance are unequaled. This film highlights the dedication that many people have in order to achieve their goals. Calvin Marshall is a prime example of someone who is willing to put in a great deal of time and effort in order to fulfill his dreams. Most of all, this is a very accurate depiction of a college junior. Dealing with his lack of talent in baseball as well as a blossoming love life, we see Calvin struggle with the typical issues that most college students deal with. He is positive throughout it, though, and his story is a great one for everyone to see play out. Calvin may be given some false hope by his coach who refuses to cut him, but it only causes him to work more.

Eventually, the truth catches up to Calvin and he has to come to terms with who he really is and what his future holds. By facing failure and overcoming disappointment, he is awakened to the reality that choosing a new and more fitting dream to follow is the most difficult, but ultimately most rewarding, part of the journey. This is a great film if you're looking for an inspirational story that is not sugar-coated.",1277856000,5,1239,4.53125

8402054,4,B003PLTJRG,"Calvin Marshall is an enchanting, entertaining, evocative, exceptional coming-of-age baseball story that shines a spotlight on small-town life and the death of dreams. My favorite scene is the softball scene near the end. It authentically captures the joy and camaraderie of belonging to such a team. The mellow soundtrack adds to the charm. Rated R for the cynical, dejected coach's expletives and for brief sexuality.",1334707200,,419,5.461538461538462
8402055,2,B003PLTJRG,"I didn't like this movie because it's one of them that simply could have been a lot more, and you think maybe they're going to pull this stuff together... but no.  It's just dumb.  The acting is fine, etc., it's the story that is the problem.  I see the good reviews here and can't help but think maybe I watched some other movie.  Maybe it's just me... I don't know, but I certainly didn't like the movie, in fact I'd say it blows.  Didn't ""hate it"" else I'd give it one star, but yeah, in my opinion, it blows... hard.  Hmm, maybe I do hate it... bleh, I'll give it two stars anyway, just in case.",1330041600,,599,4.120689655172414
8402056,4,B003PLTJRG,"This film is the Indie equivalent of Calvin Marshall himself- Understated, flying beneath the radar, and possessing strengths and charms big budget pictures often dream about but hardly ever realize.  The triumphs of this film were considerable, and its flaws miniscule.

The acting was well done (if a bit volcanic by Steve Zahn) but hit most of the right shades and tones.  Whenever the film wandered perilously close to maudlin self absorption and cloying sentimentality, it recovered with the help of deft comic timing.

The baseball was believable and well photographed and staged, and relationships true and conceptually understandable.  The only misstep in my mind was the inevitable-ish pairing of the Doug and Tori characters.  It was as if the screenwriters decided that level of tension was required to elicit more passion from the title character.  Calvin's aggression towards Coach Little became an overplayed caricature- both unnecessary and infantile.  The coach's womanizing and drinking was also exaggerated to the point of excess but never strayed over the line.

Aside from some occasionally (and hilariously) profane dialog, it's a story that appeals to all ages.  There is true chemistry between Coach and Calvin.  Michelle Lombardo (as Tori) vacillates between coquettish post teen shallowness and absorbing angst (the scene with her mother).

""Calvin Marshall"" was a special experience and much more than a mere ""baseball flick"".",1320796800,,1452,5.433035714285714
8402057,5,B003PLTJRG,"I came across this movie in search of movies to help get my baseball fix during the offseason and was pleasantly surprised. Calvin Marshall is about baseball and romance in a small junior college town with Calvin's passion for the game at center focus. One of the best things about this film is the duality of the main characters. Calvin Marshall is a square, but exudes charisma. He's also a lousy baseball player, but a softball legend. Tori Jensen is a dominant volleyball player, yet very tender within. Coach Little is a foul-mouthed grinder with a soft heart. The chemistry between the characters is there, and there's no question that director Gary Lundgren nailed it so between Calvin (Alex Frost) and Tori (Michelle Lombardo). This movie spoke to me as one of many who will never know what it's like to play professional ball, yet holds a strong passion for the game. I kinda felt like I was living vicariously thru Calvin as he did all his workouts, booted all those grounders and hammered those softballs. Steve Zahn was very convincing as Coach Little, barking off commands with authority, but also tiptoeing thru his relationship with Calvin. This film does a great job of taking you on an emotional rollercoaster while looking at the flaws and strengths of our humanity. The cinematography is well-done with wonderfully shot perspectives and terrific use of color. The soundtrack lent itself to that mellow, introspective tone. If I had to compare it with a TV show, 'Ed' would probably be the closest in terms of the overall feel. It's hard to think of another great, feel-good baseball movie like this, which makes Calvin Marshall a classic, IMO.",1297123200,3,1662,4.876325088339223
