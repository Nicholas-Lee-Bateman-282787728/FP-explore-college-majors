8383586,5,6303093302,"Back in 1992, Nickelodeon launched a smash game show called Guts. It is still to this day one of the very first fantasy-style sports game shows that was ever introduced to the public. For the half-hour version, the game show would hace 3 different kids from three different schools battle against each other in five amazing events, testing their skills in swimming and balance, speed and fearlessness, and of course determination and coordination.
The 1993 Guts All Star Special was the same fact as well. The special was hosted by Mike O' Malley, the same guy who is on the CBS show, Yes Dear. He was the main host of the show until 1995, when Guts was cancelled. In the special, the contestants would battle their way through eight events, instead of five. At the time, the events were new to the game show, like Tornado Run, where the contestants would actuallt run across the track, battling elements from a fierce tornado from wind, to broken stones. Other events would also maintain a balance, with Mad Max, a three-wheeled bike race across the track, like a futuristic war zone, and Rebound. Rebound is an aerial-fighting game, where the contestants would be attached to bungee cords trying to leap into the air, and see who will be the first to grab the basketball.
Although Guts was a spinoff from American Gladiators, it made kids really have a good time and enjoy theirselves, as if they were there favorite sports players. It is just a shame the Nickelodeon doesn't air Guts anymore. It was just one of the best game shows on television to this date. Hopefully, you can find this video and enjoy these kids in the heat of the motion. Do you Have It?",1046563200,4,1661,4.653061224489796
