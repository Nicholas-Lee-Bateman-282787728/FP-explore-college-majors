8725092,5,B00D1VYXFS,"Really loved it. In my opinion, this workout is suitable for all levels especially for beginners and intermediate who can grow with it. I think advanced exercisers could also take advantage of it if using heavier weights and at a faster pace. The first segment is kickboxing cardio which I really liked as you have time to learn the moves, good form is highlighted and the choreography is simple enough to follow. The strength segment consists of a set of 6 exercises repeated 3 times, each time kicking it up a notch (balance challenge, faster pace etc.). I loved the stretch portion: I felt completely stretched and relaxed at the end. As in the other workout, Aimee provides us with different options and has an encouraging style. I hope volume 2 is on its way.",1376352000,3,764,4.666666666666667
