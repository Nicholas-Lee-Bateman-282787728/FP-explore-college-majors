It is not a concert per see but clips of several of their best songs done at their club in Vancouver.  It has lots of life and wonderful goings on, humor, music and good times.",1389744000,,281,4.203703703703703
8189145,4,B000P6B0A8,"The VHS video cassette tape was in fine shape and the box it came in was in good shape.  The video is a nice mixture of the Rovers performing in an Irish bar and out in the Irish countryside.  Unfortunately their biggest hits including ""The Unicorn"" and the ""The Orange and Green"" are done in a medley so you don't get the full songs.",1278806400,,334,4.203125
8189146,5,B000P6B0A8,"I have this.  I ordered it from the Irish Rovers website.  It's a compliation of different scenes from a second syndicated show they did in the eighties after the success of the Wasn't That A Party single.  It was shot at their Unicorn Pub I believe located in Toronto, Canada and on location in Ireland.  It's very good.  If it becomes available order it.  I recommend it.",1183161600,,373,4.492537313432836
