2577298,5,B000FNNHW0,"If you like Jackass, Viva La Bam, Wild Boyz, or any of that stuff, you have to check this out. These guys started before any of that, and they do it better. Much better. More extreme, far more funny. Jackass and the others, always have this feeling like everything is controlled, and no one really gets seriously hurt. These guys do this stuff for real. They get hurt, constantly breaking bones, losing thumbs, all sorts of stuff. Even the few places ""Jackasses"" pop up in it, all they have to say is these guys are outta f*cking control, and freely admit these guys did it first, and do it best.

 Not for those with weak stomachs, but certainly a million laughs if you are into this type of thing. From the human dartboard, to the shotgun accident, revenge on Mr. Hitler, testicle mouse trap, and everything in between, it was a great ride.

I've loved these guys for a long time, I hope they make more stuff soon. Also check out their tv show.",1235952000,,946,4.425287356321839
2577299,5,B000FNNHW0,"funny, funny, funny. theese guys deserve a nomminee for the stuff they put there bodies through and the humerous stuff they do to each other. this movie i recomend to any one who likes cky1-4, haggard, jackass seasons and movies, viva la bam seasons 1-5, wild boys all seasons,and any of the other off the wall movies they put out. the dudesons are the champs of mutilation comedy f!@k any one elses oppinion if it says different!!!!!!!!  HIGHLY RECOMEND",1234224000,,454,4.746835443037975
2577300,5,B000FNNHW0,When I received the movie it was in excellent condition. It was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she just loved it!,1231200000,,119,4.217391304347826
2577301,5,B000FNNHW0,"Hilarious movie! These guys are worse than the Jackass crew. This movie tells all about the beginning of the crew and who they all are, which was good to me because I knew nothing about them. Then, they get to the stunts. Whether it's lighting each other on fire or putting their face in a pile of ants, the pranks never end. You have to cringe at a few of the scenes and yell ""Are you an idiot! Don't do that!"" at the TV screen. I loved it and I love The Dudesons AND their pet pig Britney. Plus, in the extras they have great sound cuts and short bios of a few bands from Finland that play during their movie. I just hope that they come out with a second movie completely filled with crazy stunts.",1175212800,,699,4.109489051094891
2577302,5,B000FNNHW0,It's nice to see where Johnny Knoxville and the dudes from Jackass got their ideas and inspirations from.  The Dudesons are the real deal and perform many crazy and bonebreaking stunts.  Beyond the stunts they all have very diverse personalities and great senses of humor.  If your not too squeemish I would highly recommend this dvd.,1161993600,2,334,4.928571428571429
2577303,5,B000FNNHW0,"Now, some of the stunts you'll remember from Jackass, but these guys are the original inventors of idiotic things to do on a saturday.  really funny, documentary style.  great addition to the jackess/steve-o/cky collection.  the ending alone is worth the costs.",1157760000,2,261,5.317073170731708
2577304,5,B000FNNHW0,"The Dudesons r very funny all the stunts we hilarious, but i wish they did more stunts instead of the Jarp and Juk...introductions but all and all it's a good dvd",1156809600,3,162,4.258064516129032
2577305,5,B000FNNHW0,all i can say is the dudesons rock they are the creators of jackass type shows  buy this if you wanna laugh or just say holy sh** these fins are nuts,1153440000,5,149,3.806451612903226
2577306,5,B000FNNHW0,"I have to say that when I realized the Dudesons were getting their own television show on Spike TV I was thrilled. The Dudesons are really the pioneers of shock comedy. After seeing their involvement in episodes of Viva La Bam I always hoped they would finally get the recognition they so deserve in a show of their own.

If you're a fan of CKY, Viva La Bam, Wild Boys, etc., you have to get this DVD for your collection. The movie is simply hillarious and entails stunts that are not for the faint of heart, that's for sure. I have watched the entire video but was disappointed when I realized that the first season of the Spike TV show is merely edited clips from this movie.

Nonetheless, this is a great DVD, go buy it. You'll laugh and cry harder than you ever have before.",1153267200,10,778,4.321917808219178

2577309,4,B000FNNHW0,"love the dudesons. i remember watching them on spike tv all the time. movie is great, you can get it on google video or whatever, but definitly worth getting it for the commentary and the extra features.",1341878400,,203,4.513513513513513
2577310,4,B000FNNHW0,"The equivalent of Jackass 2.5 in my opinion. Funny stunts, great footage, and hilarious. But there is just as much interviewing as there are stunts. Regardless, BUY IT NOW!!!",1305417600,,174,5.0344827586206895
2577311,5,B000FNNHW0,The Dudesons Are A Jackass Type Of Style But I Think They Are Funner Then Jackass. They Are From Finland So You May Not Have Heard Of Them But This Movie Is A Deff Have To Have. So Make Sure You Order This Movie. Very Funny. Got Any Questions Hit Me Up On Here,1301443200,,260,3.8333333333333335
2577312,4,B000FNNHW0,"These guys are CRAZY!!!  Jackass has nothing on these guys.  I have always been a big fan of jackass, viva la bam, and the wildboyz so I had to give these guys a try.  They are so insane, you cant help but watch these guys do extreme stunts that just don't compare to anything that you have ever seen.  They have been friends since childhood and do crazy stunts together.  These guys were ever before jackass, so they are the real jackasses.  if you love jackass and all those other shows that are similar and want to add to your collection, this is a must.",1287014400,,557,4.257142857142857
2577313,5,B000FNNHW0,"For fans of Jackass , & CKY videos the Dudesons are in a class all buy them self , these are extreme stunts , with real hospital visits and operations to boot, 4 dudes from Finland with there pet Pig Brittney and cow Parris, there is nothing these guys will not do to entertain us.
 Before comming to America in 2010 on MTV , the Dudesons had there own local access channel hit show "" Dudesonitt"" extreme "" in Finish , and english version the Dudesons , 4 seasons ten years of hilarious highjinks , pranks, stunts , practical jokes, the movie is a compulation of there english version of the Dudesons show , great movie Bam Margera and steve -O from Jackass make cameo apperances.
 A must for any Jackass fan , they blow jackass away !!
 check out the Dudesons in America Thursday nights on MTV !!",1274659200,,797,4.3355704697986575
2577314,4,B000FNNHW0,"If you are a fan of Jackass, you owe it to yourself to check this out.  These guys are absolutely hysterical and started well before the Jackass guys got together.  The material is presented in a way that allows you to get to know them and really you feel like you are laughing right along with them.  The stunts are mind boggling in this film and unlike Jackass they show the repercussions of their actions in graphic detail.  I'm not really spoiling anything here but after a particularly spectacular stunt we are treated to the viewing as H.P. has his broken leg screwed back together in surgery.  Another scene has one of the guys admitted to the hospital with a possible broken back.  It is all fun though as there is laughter through every ache and pain.  And Finland is a beautiful country.",1259539200,,797,4.531468531468532
2577315,5,B000FNNHW0,"I am a big fan of the Viva La Bam/Jackass franchise and ended up catching the Dudesons TV show on Spike a few years back. I ended up picking up this dvd a few months back and I just love it. They are 10x crazier than the Jackass crew ever were. Jarno, Jarpii, Jukka and HP are just a bunch of extreme sport loving, adrenaline rush seeking best buddies who love to hurt themselves for the attention/laughter of others. What makes it even better is that even though they pull pranks on each other, they still remain best friends. Like Jarno says--""pain is temporary, but video is eternal!""

It's also pretty good eye candy if you dig Finnish guys. :) (I'm looking at you HP and Jukka!)",1245196800,,683,4.377952755905512
