8178959,5,B000066C6O,"i love these two movies!

i don't see how you could hate them. Cobra vs. ninja is amazingly bad in a way. but thats what makes it so good! something that may be interesting to learn is that Godfree Hoe who ""Directed"" this film made it in a rather unusual and unorthadox way; about half of the footage in the film was taken from a film stock wearhouse in Taiwan...it was discarded kung fu footage. he then filmed some sences to help tie the unfinished material together and walla!...Cobra vs ninja was born!",1096761600,,506,4.440860215053763
8178960,1,B000066C6O,"I have started amassing a kung-fu library of my own, and while I appriciated some of the early bruce lee stuff, i didn't see why everyone loved it so fast. Then I got this DVD. If this was the competition, Bruce Lee must have won every award in the known world. This set of movies is more funny due to its poor job than purely entertaining. Eagle Claw champion is not as funny in this way, but Cobra vs. Ninja is simply awesome. I close with the best three words of the movie ""ninja challenge card.""",1075593600,,499,4.208333333333333
