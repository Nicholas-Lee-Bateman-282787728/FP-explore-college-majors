2990502,5,B000WSVBG2,"The following is a summary of each of the nine seasons. I offer details of plot developments so be advised there are SPOILERS AHEAD.

Season 1 (5 stars) - If nothing has happened since this season was first released, then this set consists of the cut syndicated versions that are missing the closing minutes of the show. My rating is for the original content, not the cut versions. You can see Roseanne and the cast struggle in the first few episodes trying to get accustomed to ensemble comedy versus her stand-up routine, however the show improves very rapidly and has some great individual episodes. This is the only season where Roseanne and all of her friends work at Wellman's factory - they all walk off the job during the last episode in response to the tyranny of a new factory manager played by Fred Thompson of all people.

Season 2 (5 stars) - This marks the first of the very best seasons of the series, which includes seasons two through four, ending with Becky's marriage to Mark at the beginning of season five and the exit of her character from the show. None of the episodes in this season are klunkers, and the acting and writing are top-notch. A big theme in this year's show is Roseanne trying to find stable employment after she walked off of her factory job at the conclusion of the first season. I especially like how this season handled the real-life issue of what happens to a person like Roseanne who has only a high school education when she loses a factory job that, although adequately-paying, does not provide any experience in doing anything that another employer would find valuable. ""Boo!"" is the first of what became a tradition on Roseanne, which was the Halloween special that occurred every year from this point through the duration of the show.

Season 3 (5 stars) - Season three of Roseanne doesn't revolve around any particular overriding story arc, but the kids are definitely beginning to grow up. The late Glenn Quinn first appears as rebel and smart-mouth Mark Healey in ""Becky, Beds, and Boys"" .Becky's concerned parents forbid her to see Mark anymore, but she keeps coming up with ways to see him anyway. I liked how Mark was portrayed in these early seasons when he was ""Rebel Without a Cause"" as opposed to the last three seasons when he was transformed into ""Rebel Without a Clue"". The other plot developments include Jackie being injured and leaving the police force, Roseanne getting a job at Rodbell's, a diner in the mall, and Dan opening a motorcycle shop of his own.

Season 4 (5 stars) - Season Four of Roseanne has some of the best individual episodes as well as the best overall storyline of any of the show's nine seasons. The season opens with the Conners having opened their motorcycle shop on their own after irresponsible friend Ziggy ran out on them at the last minute last season, Roseanne and Dan have finally accepted Becky and Mark as a couple, Darlene is starting high school, and Jackie has been drifting ever since she left the police force rather than accept a desk job due to her back injury. This season probably does the best job of combining great comedy, hard-hitting drama, and highlighting situations that should look familiar to any member of the middle class. Although this is not the last of the good seasons of Roseanne, I would say season four is the last of the golden years of that series, and definitely worth viewing.

Season 5 (5 stars) - The season starts out on a very morose note that corresponds to the deep recession the country was suffering when these shows aired in 1992. Dan's motorcycle shop is failing and will have to be closed in order for him to salvage the mortgage on the Conner home. Rodbell's, the diner in the mall where Roseanne has worked for two years, is closing too, due to business in the mall being so bad. In order to make ends meet, the kids' college fund has been depleted so that Becky, while filling out college applications, throws a fit when she asks her parents about this fund and finds it no longer exists. She elopes with boyfriend Mark and moves to Minnesota, since with the closing of Dan's shop, Mark is unemployed too. This opens up a crevice in Becky and Dan's relationship that takes months to heal. I compliment the show for incorporating the very bad recession going on in 1992 into the storyline. However, the Conners' troubles came on very suddenly and were resolved with a very pat answer. In retrospect, it all seemed like a somewhat contrived attempt to help Bill Clinton get elected. Just as homeless people didn't seem to exist on TV until Ronald Reagan was elected president, it seemed like everyone in Lanford was on the road to starvation until the outcome of the 1992 election seemed inevitable, and then economic conditions suddenly normalized.

Season 6 (5 stars) - Although this season has some excellent episodes, and overall is a five star season, we begin to see the start of some of the trends that eventually becomes the downfall of the series.  ""A Stash From the Past"", ""The Driver's Seat"", and ""Lies My Father Told Me"" are three of the better individual episodes. One of the better long arcs of the season involves Darlene hiding the fact that David is with her in Chicago, rather than in Michigan with his mother. For the bad part of the season, it seems that this is the beginning of a trend in ""Roseanne"" where men tend to be disposable. Jackie becomes pregnant by one of Dan's coworkers - ""Fred"" - who is never even given the courtesy of a last name, and Mark, previously depicted as an independent-minded and able mechanic is now portrayed as someone who can't even make passing grades in trade school.

Season 7 (4 stars) - Season 7 still has enough good episodes and even some great ones for it to be worthwhile viewing, but it is definitely the beginning of the end. Roseanne begins one of the longest pregnancies in the history of television this season - thirteen months plus the time Roseanne has been pregnant before she announces the news. Next, Jackie discovers Darlene at a motel in the middle of the day, and it turns out that the boy with Darlene is not David, it's a new boyfriend - Jimmy. David says he is OK with it, but Roseanne is not and tells Darlene to make a choice. She does - and dumps a heartbroken David. The whole issue of the broken romance between David and Darlene and its resolution is one of the best parts of the season. One of the worst parts of the season is the Thanksgiving episode when Roseanne's pregnancy looks like it might be in trouble. She screeches at both DJ and Dan every time they offer an opinion as if they are trying to tell her what to do instead of the possiblility that they just want to comfort her and lighten the load. Jackie tires of Fred, whom she married less than a year before, and promptly disposes of him. After a few obligatory appearances in Season 8 he disappears entirely as though he had never existed in the first place.

Season 8 (3 stars) - This season you have to really pick through episodes full of fantasy, inane slapstick, and politically correct undertones to get to the truly good blue collar slice-of-life episodes that made up the majority of episodes in prior years. The season opener, ""Shower the People You Love with Stuff"", very unceremoniously returns Lecy Gorenson as Becky Conner Healy, with Roseanne taking advantage of the sudden replacement with an inside joke by remarking that it seems like Becky's been gone for four years - exactly how long Lecy Gorenson has been gone from the show. The biggest problem with season eight is that Roseanne NEVER did fantasy episodes well during any season, and this season is full of them. It was particularly sad to see what became of the Halloween episode this year, always a Roseanne staple. Gone are the outrageous costumes and the clever pranks of previous years. They have now been replaced by a circus of the absurd and the bizarre.

Season 9 (3 stars) - Many people did not like the ninth season of Roseanne, but in its totality, I found it fascinating. The main problem was that it was clumsily written and directed, and that is mainly why I am giving it three stars. You have to look at this season in the context of Roseanne's actual life. By the ninth season, the show had gradually been losing that genuine quality of a real working-class family for a couple of seasons at least in part because, by 1996, Roseanne herself had not been living a blue-collar lifestyle for over a decade. It was probably much easier for Roseanne to do something she knew - play a woman with a blue-collar background who comes into sudden wealth. Just prepare yourself for more than a few cringe-worthy moments of TV viewing.",1192060800,47,8705,4.6248382923674

2990534,2,B000WSVBG2,The disk started out playing ok but fuzzy so I gave it a chance and it really never got any better. I changed dvd players but still no difference. I thought the disk would be remastered and clear..I was wrong so I watched them the best I could. Atleast all the episodes were there. I have a 60' tv and it would only play in the center of the tv in a square box in the center of the tv and I tried every setting and nothing would change. They seem cheaply made and for the price im very disappointed especially what I paid for it. What really ticked me off was I see the same exact box set at walmart today at walmart for 21.95 and that really got under my skin compaired to what I purched them on amazon for. No disrespect  but just stating the truth.,1518480000,,751,4.040268456375839

Looking for seller contact. Maybe Ill just return and reorder! :( I was hoping to watch the whole thing before the new episodes next month.

I did return and reorder. The new set just arrived. I got all the correct discs. The set packaging was totally different. Much better this time around. Would have given this 5 stars had everything been right the first time.",1517616000,,527,4.489583333333333

2990553,4,B000WSVBG2,Love this iconic 90's show. I grew up with this show so I'm stoked it's getting a reboot. Since the entire series isn't available on any of my streaming networks I purchased from here. Just be wary when you open the box; the packaging is VERY flimsy! So be prepared.,1515715200,,266,4.34

2990558,5,B000WSVBG2,"Love the show!

About the packaging:
Mill Creek is a budget releasing company, and it shows through with this set. What you get is a stack of discs in sleeves loosely crammed in a holder inside of the large plastic box. The picture quality is also pretty standard definition.",1514678400,,275,4.612244897959184
2990559,3,B000WSVBG2,"I'm giving this three stars due to the packaging and the fact that there are many episodes missing. I grew up watching Roseanne and know almost every episode and I know there is a handful missing, mostly special episodes and some Halloween ones. So it's really not a complete set. Also the packaging is horrid as others have said. The discs are not in order in the case and are in paper sleeves. The discs themselves are low quality and scratch very easily. However, at this price point you do get what you pay for. I am happy to have this in my collection.",1514505600,,557,4.365384615384615

2990564,4,B000WSVBG2,I love this show. My only complaint is towards the manufacturer. The dvds come in little paper holders rather than something to protect the dvds. Im fearful one day one dvd will get scratched and Ill have to purchase the entire collection for one dvd.,1513036800,,251,4.6

It comes in a thick case and each dvd is in it's own dvd slip (which I like because that makes it less likely for them to get scratched). I use to watch this comedy show in the 90's and it's always had me laughing on a roll with every episode. Gotta love Roseanne and the Conor Family!!!,1512518400,,430,4.130952380952381

*Includes all of the episodes from each season
*Amazing Price
*Compact in one box

Cons
*the DVDs are in paper disc holders (one on each side) so the holders can get out of order pretty easily if you drop them
*the holders make it a bit hard to see the DVD title/episode because only half of the DVD shows at a time
* The box and the holder do not protect the DVDs well

I read the other reviews about the shoddy packaging, so I also ordered a zip-up dvd holder with the understanding that the dvd box wasn't well made to begin with. But when it arrived, the whole dvd case was smashed so bad it doesn't even close, it was just hel together with the plastic wrap it came in. all the dvds look fine, but some have some mars on them. Can't tell if they'll be a problem yet, so I'm watching them all first before I decide whether or not I have to return them. If I hadn't also ordered the dvd holder, I would have been royally screwed. It's one thing for the packaging to be sub-par, but mine was so bad it couldn't hold anything anymore. If you love the show, buy this set - it's cheap and the quality is high considering the cameras it was filmed with. Just don't expect the to be able to display the case anywhere.",1493683200,,917,4.186440677966102

This is great show and is well worth having in your DVD collection.  However,  i have noticed on several occasions there have been some edits made too some episodes and certain scenes where there is music involved.  These scents still appeared on the netflix version and the TV versions.
A few tags scenes in season 8 and 9 have been completely removed, while some others have been altered.  Some music in the episodes have been replaced with a different music peace of some sort from its original.

2990639,5,B000WSVBG2,"""Roseanne"" is one of those shows that became an instant classic and it's loved by many!  Seasons 1-6 were great!  Season 7 is when it started slipping in quality.  Season 8 had some really good episodes, plus, Lecy Goranson returned as Becky.  The less said about season 9, the better.  The first few episodes weren't too bad, but, it got ridiculous really fast to the point where it became stupid.  There was too much focus on Roseanne and Jackie.  They were doing all these fancy things and meeting rich people all the time.  It became hard to watch.  Granted, I watched the whole last season, but, I honestly just can't stand it.

Aside from that, the show is great!  Season one had some terrific episodes, especially ""Life and Stuff,"" the series premiere.  The whole kitchen fight scene is great!  ""Oh, but, honey, you just fixed dinner three years ago!""

For me, the best seasons were 1-5.  I didn't really care too much for Sarah Chalke as Becky,  but, I didn't hate her.  I just preferred Lecy Goranson more.

The collection is great, although there could've been more special features.  For the price, it's great!  The picture and sound quality are great!  Highly recommended!",1492560000,,1184,4.733990147783251

The packing is the worst. I got my series in dvd sleeves. Cardboard dvd sleeves. The box was already ripped almost ready to fall apart. How this complete series was released was beyond me.

2990768,3,B000WSVBG2,"I had a really hard time rating this show because I absolutely ADORE the first 3 seasons. Not only did this show give an unprecedented mele of humor and reality - especially for those of us who grew up completely differently and really had no idea what it was like for working class families - but the acting was just awesome.

What I especially loved and still love in those first few seasons is the unvarnish, unpretentious approach - no glitz, no glamor, no faking or phoning it in. But, alas, Roseanne soon got fake and the stories became more and more ridiculous - to say nothing of the truly appalling decision to put Sarah Chalke in as Becky. Not only was Chalke absolutely pathetic, lame and not the least bit adept in portraying Becky, but it never ceases to amaze me that she went on to another successful tv show while Lecy Goranson - the original Becky - didn't. But then Goranson pursued a college education at a renowned college, so good for her.

Either way, the show's early episodes were and remain among my absolute favorite things to watch. They're almost raw in their honesty. I still love John Goodman, who I'm glad to see continues to act to this day.",1467072000,5,1173,4.502347417840376
2990769,5,B000WSVBG2,"Loved growing up watching this series and love that I have it available to watch now. The dvd's play great, which is all that really matters when buying them.",1466985600,,158,4.482758620689655
2990770,5,B000WSVBG2,"Honestly, This was a decent price for all the hours, and episode that come with it. Not to mention the Nostalgia factor.  The quality is decent for the video and audio.  Now, that has been said....  I am going to have to state something that I really don't like about it.  But in the end, It is a rather small grievance.

But the case that it comes in is rather crappy.  It comes with a ton of discs, that are only in sleeves.  Not a big deal. But they get scratched easier in sleeves from MY experiences with them.  Plus, I just rather have them in something a bit more held in place than a sleeve.

The front of the case, when I got it was squashed, at some point in it's journey..  So I can see the plastic imprints of inside the case on the outside of it, all through the front cover.  But my biggest issue with it was that,  All's I did was open the case, as you would any other case....  And the plastic tabs inside the case, that these sleeves sit inside.  They busted right off, just from me OPENING the case.  These plastic tabs inside the case are very flimsy and crap-tastic.

But all in all, It was a good purchase.  It's just annoying to fork out any amount of money for something, and to have something on it break in the first 10 minutes of using it.",1466726400,8,1265,4.118852459016393

2990777,5,B000WSVBG2,"Great set of the Roseanne series. All of the discs are wrapped in a paper wrapper with a clear plastic front so that you can see which disc it is without taking it out. Each season has three discs each and all of the DVDs work perfectly. This hilarious series is about a blue collar family and their day to day struggles with money, kids, family, marriage and work. Most of it is hilarious and easy to relate to, but some is very heartfelt and hits on some of the harder parts of life like abuse, alcoholism, and infidelity.",1465257600,,524,4.303030303030303
2990778,3,B000WSVBG2,Came on time. Packaging & box are weird & the disk come in individual sleeves. Would be much easier to use & keep in order if they were attached to box. Some of the dvds has the wrong episode list in the beginning but correct episodes.,1465171200,,235,4.130434782608695

2990790,5,B000WSVBG2,"Who doesn't love Roseanne?  She's the perfect representation of so many of our experiences growing up in America in the '90s.  This is a classic show that is appropriate for the whole family and is actually enjoyable for the whole family.  I would recommend this to anyone, although probably not people from outside America as some of it might be confusing or come across brash.  My fiance and I love watching this after dinner, it's a good bonding activity and we grow closer to one another by reminiscing about the references in the show and comparing our own experiences to that of Roseanne and her family.",1463875200,,609,4.716981132075472

Season 4 and on I have to spend 10+ minutes fighting with my player to load the disc to play. And once I get it to play you commit to finishing the disc or battle it out to get it to play.

This show tackled contemporary issues unapologetically with often comedic delivery to drive the moral of the story home. Personally, the earlier seasons were more light hearted and pushed humor more subtley. The last seasonseason in the series werected more dark and broody to me.

I'm only on disc one and the picture is kinda grainy even when i fix the settings on my tv. Also the way the discs were just thrown in there was annoying. I had to take everything out and count to make sure everything was there.

2990919,3,B000WSVBG2,"As others have said, the packaging left much to be desired with it's bulk disc nesting and individual paper sleeves but I knew this upon purchasing so I wasn't surprised upon it's receipt. The quality of video was where I was disappointed. Several episodes (5+ total) throughout the seasons have moments of discoloration. The screen will turn blue, purple or green with an occasional ""pop"" or crackle sound and immediately return to normal. I thought I had a malfunctioning system but when I reversed/rewound(?) the counter back to the spot in question we always received the same results, no matter the equipment used. In the end, due to the hassle of shipping and the limited occurrences, I decided to keep the set. Eh, it's still a fun rewatch.",1447891200,3,747,4.84375

However I was not impressed with the discs itself. They are all stacked on top of each other and only have a few episodes per disc, thus the large amount of CDs. The quality was so so. It was either season two or three that had a really low volume. Anyways, I actually returned our set because all of these reasons and the fact that my plastic casing was cracked. Maybe if they ever decide to update the series to blu ray, I'd buy it and keep it.",1447372800,,577,3.9827586206896552
2990924,4,B000WSVBG2,Love Roseanne! Only problem I had with this set was on one of the discs on I think season 6 or 7 it is completely missing one episode.

2990946,5,B000WSVBG2,"My box came in very good condition; each disc came inside its own sleeve, all stacked on top of each other with season 1, disc 1 being on top. All 9 seasons are here. Every disc says which season it is and is labeled disc 1, 2 or 3 (As in Season 2 disc 3)

 I can see why people don't like the packaging  since the sleeves are just cheap paper ones. I recommend getting a CD/DVD holder. (Kinda like a photo album, I'm sure you know what I'm talking about) all together there is 27 DVDs so buy a 28 disc holder (around 7-9 dollars) and it'll be a lot easier when having to put in the next DVD while watching.

The actual quality of the DVDs are great! I'm so happy to be watching all the episodes in chronological order!

Seriously; if you love this show; buy this. It's well worth the money! Just remember about the packaging and just buy the disc holder. 5 stars for DVD quality; and hey, that's the most important thing here.",1442016000,6,927,4.156424581005586

Now if you can give me Golden Girls and Designing Women in the same concept and price I would be elated. A great Christmas gift for any Roseanne fan!,1437091200,,454,4.433734939759036

They sit in this little square insert that isn't quite big enough to keep the top couple from poking out and there's no way to keep them permanently in order. I kind of expected more of a box set, like bound-in plastic sleeves at least.

2991045,3,B000WSVBG2,"I bought this set for my spouse as the more fan of Roseanne.  Although the episodes were enjoyable and I heard a lot of laughter from the vicinity of the TV (myself providing some of that laughter), it was not all a bed of roses.

What cost this set 2 stars were 2 problems:

1:  The menu control of all disks in the set was so slow you felt like you could watch an episode waiting for it to load one!  I've purchased many DVDs (individuals and sets) and have never seen such slow response and if you accidentally hit stop twice -- BEWARE!  This added a level of frustration that offset much of the fun of the series.

2:  Although there were some scenes seen that were not remembered (maybe having viewed some episodes on repeat/syndication where some small items may have been cut out) there were also areas where parts seem to be missing or cut out.  The most noticeable one is one that has been reported in these reviews already -- the ending of the 8th season episode that showed the 2 Beckys like the old Pattie Duke show.  Instead of the montage of scenes, a black background was seen behind he closing credits.

How can you call it ""The Complete Series"" with parts cut out and/or changed?",1427155200,5,1196,4.366515837104072

2991047,5,B000WSVBG2,"This complete ""Roseanne"" is excellent. Contrary to a few other comments, we *like* the fact that each disc has its own sleeve. This assures long term protection, and we wish more large sets adopted this obvious method. As for having to flip through all the discs to find the episode you want, the package design makes location easy, and return to the proper order is simple, too.
We checked all the discs to be sure there were no blanks as some other buyers had reported. So far we're delighted to have the entire series of one of our favorite all time-shows, all at a remarkably low cost.",1426636800,,589,4.514018691588785
2991048,5,B000WSVBG2,"Love this show one of my favorites it got dramatic at times but for the most part it was very funny hilarious even at times.

I agree with a lot of people though I liked the last season...in parts but overall it was an unmitigated disaster.

I tend to just look at seasons 1-7 as the real seasons of Roseanne and pretend like the last season was merely a nightmare.

The final season ruined a lot of the show and quite frankly was not needed it could have ended after the 7th season but they decided to go one more round.

In doing so they destroyed the whole show : the concept of what the show was about in the first place .

The ending of Roseanne also? That ending? Phew suffice it to say it was....horrible.

All I can say is if you expect a happy ending for the show please think again.

I won't ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it I just ask that people go into this show with a fair level head enjoy the comedy and enjoy the golden age of Roseanne in the beginning and stop when you get close to the last season.

Believe me it would have been better that way.

The complete series is packed with interviews bloopers and every episode is uncut and unedited which is awesome considering most of these complete series nowadays are cut to shreds and tarnished .",1426550400,2,1268,4.206611570247934

2991067,5,B000WSVBG2,"Roseanne has always been a child-hood favorite of mine which brought me endless laughter and its the reason why I would always be glued to the TV anytime a Roseanne re-run came on.  That same magnetism or glue is what brought me here and why I couldn't be happier with this complete set.  Since I started streaming Roseanne on Netflix, I was hooked.  However their collection only contained the earlier seasons and thus, like a fiend, I had to have the complete set.  When I saw this, I was sold, esp. at its price.  Wowser!  This is the complete series and although the packaging is a bit flimsy, it more than does the job for what's required.  It's all there and intact.  Plus, at this price, how can you beat it?  The discs even include extras like bloopers and cast interviews.  This is just an added bonus for an already substantial set--and each episode is in the best quality they can be in (with the later seasons teetering more towards higher quality).  The packaging is not the best but it does the job; its minimal but its part of the reason why this set is cheap.  Where else would you found a baffling 9 seasons (27 discs) of a show for under $30.  Think about it, that's a little more than a $1 per disc.

It's Roseanne, one of the most real and hilarious sitcoms of its day and its why it got all the acclaim and popularity it did when it was aired.  This set is perfect to reminiscence in the glory days of 80/90s TV and have a good laugh at the end of the day.  The beauty of Roseanne is that it encompasses more than just laughs, their was a stark realism to it which also integrates drama, real-life wisdom with close-to-heart/home messages.  Also, it recognizes its flaws like in life and instead of masking them, the show really embraces them--often making light of the situation with mockery/sarcasm or capping it off with a wholesome message.  Also, you'll soon realize how brilliant some of their performances are--each cast perfect for their role with hilarity and sarcasm with Roseanne and uncanny humor at the center.  With some being pivotal, John Goodman namely with performances that it seems only he could pull off.  Also, Laurie Metcalf pulls of some stops where she is truly in her element; always on the fringe of collapse while being hilarious.  A role that's probably a lot harder to pull off than she makes it seems.  Other worthy mentionables are Sara Gilbert who has this dark yet sarcastic wit that she executes with great timing.  Oh and of course Roseanne Barr, who is great at writing setups and punchlines that are really at the core of the show--she has a timeless humor and has a gift of tireless laughter.",1425340800,2,2652,4.536842105263158
2991068,5,B000WSVBG2,For the price paid I can live with the dvds being in paper sleeves. Got every episode and all discs work (tested them all out). Other reviews said they had issues but this came perfect and we have been watching a few episodes each night and it is just like watching them back in the day. Made me laugh all over again here and there. I haven't seen some of these episodes since I was a teenager and it is interesting how different I see some things now like how Becky acted or what the adults thought was funny and I didn't. Makes me realize how old I am getting seeing some of these styles in clothing and hair. Great show that I am enjoying watching all over again thanks to this fabulous box set.,1425340800,,698,4.177777777777778
2991069,2,B000WSVBG2,"Okay, this is a series that ran a long run on ABC. I have not been able to watch al 222 episodes from the purchase, but I am currently watching season 4. There are so many episodes (especially season one) that would not play; it was if they were scrambled. Season One had FIVE episodes that were not even able to be viewed. I would REALLY like a version that has been watched, scrutinized and approved for sale. There are episodes from every single season of this collection that will not play. May I remind you, this is 10 years of a series that I haven't even watched yet, If  you can verify every episode is not going to skip/scratch/skew than I will happily re-review and re-rate your series offering.",1425254400,,705,4.423076923076923

Should I come across any that are defective or sub-par in anyway, I will be sure to update my review.  Yes, the DVDs come in separate paper sleeves stacked in a huge pile inside the case, but they are all labeled and the quality of them is perfectly good too.  I guess it must just be the luck of the draw.",1425254400,,400,3.9625

2991073,3,B000WSVBG2,I'm not sure how to rate this one because I love the series but the dvd packaging for the complete series is terrible!!  It would be a better idea to buy each of the seasons separately.  All of the discs are in paper jackets and squeezed into this little square compartment.  I would think for a successful tv show like this that they would be able to have it in better cases.  Like I said the individual seasons are packaged well.  Setting that aside there are some good commentaries done by Roseanne and extras on the dvds.,1425254400,,525,4.371134020618556

2991076,4,B000WSVBG2,"There isn't much to be said about this classic sitcom that hasn't been written a million times.  It's a comedy giant right up there with the very best.  When I saw this package priced for $28.99 I could not believe my eyes.  How is that this TV classic is priced so low for the entire series while other classic comedy giants retail for well over $100.00 for complete series sets?  I decided I didn't care and purchased it.  It came today, a day before it was expected.

The outer shell is sturdy plastic and I expect it to hold up well and look great on my collection shelf.  When I opened the shell I realized one reason this set may be priced so low.  The discs are not held in standard DVD casing.  They're packaged in individual paper sleeves.  I have a problem with this for a few reasons.  1) I like things to be in order and it will be very easy for these discs to become out of order, 2) it will be more difficult to keep track of discs I've watched as I'm progressing through, and 3) while there are inside plastic clips that hold the stack of paper sleeves in place I suspect it would be very easy to damage these.

I did test the first disc, the last disc, and four random discs throughout just to make sure they played okay.  Obviously I do not have time to test all 27 discs and 222 episodes.  Despite the questionable packaging I highly recommend anyone pick this series up.  If the complete series is ever re-released with better packaging I'm sure the price will skyrocket.",1424995200,2,1490,4.309352517985611
2991077,4,B000WSVBG2,"Rosanne is a classic in TV and this review will not cover such a great show. However this will cover the packing of the discs in this complete set. I was very disappointed to see that the discs came in removable black sleeves and simply laid on the box itself. While this style of packing may of been common about 10 years ago, I expected more. It makes it difficult to actually keep track of what discs you have watched and what you have not. Either way I would recommend this product but perhaps a disc holder is in order",1424995200,,523,4.24

The menus are nice and perfect for a complete tv series collection. To have the entire series and it contains full episodes not chopped up missing scene episodes like what it aired in syndication. My collection contained every disc not like others who unfortunately didn't receive certain ones. The quality of each disc is awesome I have no complaints. Having all the discs together in one small box is nice. Others complained because it's basically loose DVDs in a stack, in which each disc has it's own sleeve. Which it is. but it doesn't bother me at all I'm thankful to have the entire series in one place. I actually wish other collections would come this way because I would buy them immediately. Again if you are a fan of the show, and for this price you truly can't pass it up! I also tested the DVDs through out as suggested... No problems at all Thanks!",1423353600,,999,4.524861878453039
2991103,5,B000WSVBG2,"I absolutely love this show! So glad I found the entire series on Amazon. I did read some reviews on here that said that when the customer received the set they were either missing discs or had blank disc. So as soon as mine came in my wife and I checked every disc. It took about 30 minutes to go through them but everyone played and none were missing. Some people complained about the paper slips that the discs set in but I said for the price and considering so many DVD's, They done a pretty good job. Yes you could get another series of a different show that might actually have hard cases but you are also going to pay 3 times as much if not more. The format is not HD but thats ok because its not on netflix either which only has the first two seasons. Overall you cant beat the price! I would suggest anyone who likes Roseanne to buy this, however i would recommend doing as my wife and i did. Check every DVD to make sure they play and are all there. Just basing that on the other reviews.",1423353600,2,998,4.123076923076923
2991104,5,B000WSVBG2,"What a great deal for the entire uncut series of ""Roseanne."" While this set didn't go overboard on deluxe packaging or a lot of extras, for the price I think this is a really decent set. Before I ordered it, I noticed a lot of people commenting about all of the discs stacked up together in paper sleeves. A couple of my sleeves were a bit bent, but all of the discs were in great shape and played well. Make sure you check all of them when you first open it and inspect for broken discs or missing/duplicate DVDs. The episodes from every season were the originals and not the chopped up ones they show in syndication. Some of the discs had extras that were produced for the single season DVD releases, and mostly include mini interviews with some of the cast (Roseanne, Laurie Metcalf, John Goodman, Alicia Goranson, Michael Fishman; the only big absence from the main cast - in the extras - was Sara Gilbert), and Roseanne (occasionally with Michael Fishman) provided sporadic commentary for a handful of the episodes. Hopefully someday there might be a nicer set with a lot more extras, but for the price, you can't beat this collection of the entire series with the original broadcast episodes.",1423267200,6,1198,4.629107981220657

2991114,5,B000WSVBG2,"Roseanne is of course famous for pushing the envelope--a habit I seem to have adopted, and she's a direct influence. At this time I've only reached season 3 of my reminiscences of the series; but that's only because I enjoy studying the assortedly recurring and/or constantly renovated familial household props (especially Godzilla, and Son of Godzilla, on the shelf behind the perpetually quilt-draped couch--the quilt of which continues to prod us with blue-collar mentality, even after they win the lottery; also, the insistent botherances of all those magnetically lurched fridge drawings, which never seem to tire of shedding and procreating with the passage of the sitcom children's scholastic years). But more than that is the intentionally impositional idea that one can overcome popular opinion and still survive.
In short, the unique blossoming of Sara Gilbert, the subtle and yet in-your-face John Goodman, the brilliantly theatrical overboard Laurie Metcalf, and, of course, ""Our Rosie"" (the title of probably my favorite episode)--all seem to take us exactly where we want to be led: to a finer and less indistinct sitcom than all the other shows of its time.

2991171,1,B000WSVBG2,"I bought this set over a year ago. The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was black facial hair, I hoped, right on the slip cover of the very first disc. This annoyed me put I wasn't about to let that ruin this series for me.
While backing them up I noticed 1 of the discs skipped. I forget which disc it was but it was at the end of the season 5 episode where Dan gets arrested for beating up the guy who hit Jackie. I immediately contacted the Mill Creek customer service. At fist they were awesome. They sent me out a replacement and even a free gift( That 70's Show: Best of Kelso.)
So I put the replacement disc in and sure enough it skips in the very same place as the first one. So I email their customer service again. To my relief they sent me out a second replacement that they ""had verified to be working and also a second Best of Kelso DVD, gee thanks? So anyways I was sure that since they verified it to be in playing order  I had nothing to worry about. So I put it in and bam it skips in the same darn place, not even joking folks.  Three discs all skip in the same place and all 3 replicated on 5 other DVD/Bluray players  So I emailed Mill Creek again and I was told ""there was nothing further they could do for me on this package."" Three discs with the same problem obviously means that there was a production problem but there was nothing more Mill Creek ""could do.""

I'm not going to tell anyone not to buy the set but just be aware of the problem with that season 5 disc.",1418256000,7,1506,4.043624161073826

They're housed in separate CD sleeves, but all in one group, so it makes it a little cumbersome to find the season or episode you want, but I don't mind considering what I paid for it. There are even episodes that I've never seen aired as reruns, probably because they're a little controversial. The special features are minimal, but interesting.

I loved watching the children grow in young adults and missed Lecy Goranson  the orginal (Becky) I was sad to see her go and return for some episodes. This show broke all the rules when allowed and Roseanne's character reminds me so much how mother was, her personality a reflection, one would say.

Because the dvd,1001 Classic Commercials is also packaged like this.
What drew me to this was the price for all 27 discs,plus i also have learned to love this show.
I like Roseanne's quick wit when it comes to situations.
I don't know about having Jackie literally around all the time and Chrystal too that can't be good for the marriage,but i guess i'm wrong on that account.
I guess that among many things made this program.
I really don't see a problem about playing these just be real careful when removing them from those sleeves.
I also highly recommend this very humorous program and it looks like all of the cast click on this too.",1408406400,,718,4.446969696969697

Each disc is in a well-constructed (some others have call them ""flimsy""...I don't know why) black envelope with a clear circular window. The discs are inside a sealed DVD case. To make life easy, when I finish watching a disc, I simply put it at the bottom of the stack. When all DVD's have been watched, you're back in order from the top down.

We are having so much fun watching this together as a family,  and what a great price for the entire series.  I am so happy I bought this.",1406246400,,285,3.8793103448275863
2991254,5,B000WSVBG2,"I bought this earlier this summer and watched the whole series (except I skipped parts of Season 9, it was so bad).  I was a fan of the series when it originally aired, and it is still so funny.  It's a loving family (not just heartless or hateful people), however they also throw harsh zingers at each other all the time.  The humor is rude, a lot, but that's often what made me laugh so hard.  And the fact that at the end of the day they were still a loving family.

Seasons 1-6 were just a blast, with a few laugh out loud moments in each episode (so bad that you have to pause the show until you stop laughing so hard).  Seasons 7 and 8 were still pretty good, but things were getting weird, the characters on the show were more stressed, Jacky never could find happiness, etc, and that just kind of slowed things down.  However, seasons 7 and 8 were still funny and entertaining.

Season 9, oh God.  They tried to have fun and get artsy (and political) with season 9, but it just didn't work.  Too many fantasy episodes, and that works with animated shows, but not shows with a strong running storyline week-to-week (the fantasy stuff just feels like an interruption).  And season 9's jokes just didn't have the zing that actually made them clever or funny.  I tried to force myself to watch season 9, but after a while I started skipping half of episodes, hoping the next one would be good, and later skipped several episodes just to see the finale (which just ended badly).  However, you're getting 8 other good seasons with the package, so you're still getting a good value.

The packaging is kind of crappy, though I imagine it keeps the cost of the product down (and saves storage room on my DVD rack), so the packaging doesn't bother me that much.",1406160000,,1759,4.405572755417957

2991257,4,B000WSVBG2,"Roseanne has been one of my favorite sitcoms since I was little and enjoyed watching re-runs. I was thrilled to see the price of this series was so low. All of my discs have worked thus far (I am on season 2) and the rest are present and look to be in great condition. My only complaint is the packaging of the discs. All of the discs are packaged in a paper slip and stacked on top of one another in the case. The case also take a bit of work to close. If the discs were packaged better it would be a 5 star rating! However, it is very nice to have such a compact case that doesn't take up a lot of room and is great for the price! I would definitely buy this product again!",1405900800,,675,3.898550724637681

I don't mind that the discs come in a sleeve and stacked-it saves money! It's fun to watch the first couple seasons and find a couple minutes that are ""new"" to me because they edit those parts out on tv! The first 4 or so seasons are really great episodes.

The episodes are not digitally remastered, but they don't look bad.  Audio is in stereo and picture isn't terrible at all.

The casing is a slight annoyance. It's a giant dvd case with each disc individually wrapped in a black paper envelope.  Each disc set has different art, so you never have to guess which disc you're putting in.

Bonus materials are on the final disc of each season.  These contains interviews and other fun featurettes.

All in all, it's totally worth the money I spent.  I love this show and I love this boxed set!",1403395200,3,686,4.296875

2991283,4,B000WSVBG2,Any fan of Roseanne should have this.  The only downside is that the case is junk.  The DVDs are kept in paper sleeves and are not attached to the actual case so they can easily get jumbled up if you aren't careful.  I got it for less than $30 at the time so the price is great but know that it's cheap because no effort was put into the packaging.,1401321600,,348,3.942857142857143

These DVD's are put out by Mill Creek, & they are by far the poorest quality on the market, I had several discs freeze, skip & flat out not work right out of the box. I had purchased DVD's of other shows put out by this company with the same disappointment. I am surprised this company is still in business & will continue to be if we keep purchasing there products. The outer sleeve states CC, which I was under the understanding that meant closed captioning, NO, that is not what it means on these discs. The DVD's put out by Anchor Bay do have closed captioning, & I would suggest anyone looking to purchase quality DVD'S, look for the ones put out by Anchor Bay & not waste your money on these.",1399420800,27,865,4.248484848484848

2991291,4,B000WSVBG2,Roseanne is one of my favorite shows and I was glad to find the complete series. The only downside is absolutely terrible packaging.

2991292,5,B000WSVBG2,"The first four seasons of Roseanne are the best in my opinion. They are Roseanne sort of like before the meltdown. Seasons 5 to 7 are pretty good, but somehow the pace, and the face, of the show has changed. Roseanne seems more acerbic and thanks to botched plastic surgery, she has undergone a rather rapid physical change and with that I mean her face. But it is still good and hilarious, Seasons 8 and 9 , and especially 9, are unwatchable. The wsohw ventures into absurd territory.

Overall this is an amazing show; very ahead of its time, witty, smart and sensitive. Things just really got bad later on as it is often the case with long-rnning shows.",1398729600,,655,4.504201680672269

2991296,5,B000WSVBG2,The series bought separately is far overpriced. I was ecstatic to find this set at a reasonable cost. I had issues with an episode not playing - but 2 or 3 out of the series isn't too bad in my opinion. Since I know every episode by heart :),1397779200,,241,3.938775510204082

2991298,3,B000WSVBG2,This is tricky.  The price is good for the full season BUT......the set I received is missing the 1st disc of Season 1.  Now.....in all fairness...I did contact Amazon.  They have sent me a replacement set and directions/return label so I can return the defective set.  They were very apologetic and helpful.  I should have my replacement set next week.,1397692800,,353,4.816666666666666

2991300,5,B000WSVBG2,"I love Roseanne. One of the TV stations started running a few episodes everyday and I had to watch it or record it so I could watch later. Doesn't matter how many times I have seen the episodes I will sit and watch again and enjoy it just as much as the first time. Which is why I finally broke down and purchased the complete series.

I know a lot of people don't like the minimalist packaging but I find it to be a bonus. You get 9 seasons but only takes up the space of 3 normal DVD cases, and it's not some outrageous price. It's very affordable and takes up little space on the shelf. It doesn't have a ton of bonus features but the ones included are worth watching. An extra bonus I have discovered is that each episode contains 1 or more scenes that for whatever reason are not included when on network tv.

I did make sure to inspect each disc when I received it and put each one in the player to make sure they all played and were the correct discs. Everything was perfect and I have watched through to season 7 now with now skips or freezes.

It arrived shrink wrapped and in a tight fitted cardboard package. There was no damage and it arrived 3 days earlier than expected. Overall I'm completely satisfied with this purchase. I wish other series would start offering more affordable season & series options. Not everyone wants to spend a fortune on overpriced ""collector's"" packaging.",1397520000,2,1396,4.382239382239383

2991306,5,B000WSVBG2,"When I was a kid, I would stay up late just to watch Roseanne. If another tv  show came on I usually turned the tv off to go down by the river, but when Roseanne was on, man nor god could tear my eyes away from the screen. I'm still as much into Roseanne as I was back then, she is a wonderful mother and a great wife. She inspired me to be a great dad to my son and a wonderful husband to my wife. She has always helped me look on the brighter side of life even in the darkest of times. Roseanne is an amazing family fun wholesome show with great family morals that is extremely rare nowadays, I would recommend Roseanne to anyone who asked. I'd give her 10 stars if it was allowed. She helped and still helps me to be the best that I can be on a daily basis. I find comfort in knowing that my son will grow up watching the same tv show that made me who I am today.

I'm a HUGE fan of Halloween & on a whim bought the Roseanne Halloween episodes at Sam's Club.  After watching that DVD (repeatedly!) I realized what a great show this is!  Honestly this is a hilarious show, depicting real life for most of us.  She's not afraid to point out alot of the lows middle class families experience & it makes you realize you're not alone.  Brilliant show.  I agree with some of the other buyers about the packaging.  It is a little annoying.  There's one big plastic box that contains all of the DVD's.  Each individual DVD is in a little paper sleeve.  So of course you'll end up flipping through a million little DVD's to find the one you want.  But each season has it's own design on the DVD & they're different colors, so it didn't bother me too much.  Overall, this is a great deal on some great entertainment!

And when I last bought it, it was about $30 a season, so this is an amazing deal. The only negative really is the actual packaging. The discs are in cheap paper sleeves and they're all just snapped into one big square inside the main box. But that's probably why it's so cheap. The DVD's all seem to play ok with no problems. I guess the only other weird thing is she said some of the episodes contain slightly different content than her other series DVD's she's had in the past. Nothing major, but she's watched them enough for me to trust her when she tells me something's different. So I guess that's the one thing I would be most disappointed in. Why would it be different? I wish they would just say, ""Directors Cut"" or ""Early Cut"" or ""Who knows what cut"" or whatever. It's just weird, ya know?",1395532800,2,962,4.291208791208791

My husband I and began watching the first few DVDs on the first season when suddenly on the episode where Darlene's appendix bursts, the DVD stopped working. Completely. Pulled it out of the player, looked perfectly fine. Put it back in tried getting it past that point and nothing. Hasn't worked at all. I haven't tried the rest of the DVDs but i am extremely disappointed thus far.",1394928000,2,736,4.5

For how little you are paying for this entire series is pretty awesome in my opinion. You buy this to be able to watch the series...not because you hope to have amazing packaging.

All of my discs where there and were completely damage free. What more could I ask for?

I have always loved this series and have always wanted to own it. Thats why when I saw the complete series for sale I hauled ass and grabbed it. True fans of the show won't be disappointed with this purchase!",1394841600,,678,4.1603053435114505

2991332,4,B000WSVBG2,"ROSEANNE
Roseanne Barr did a lot for women's rights and for nine seasons at the end of the 20th Century she helped to re-define women and working class America. Most of the credit for her effectiveness came from the ensemble surrounding her. Actors like John Goodman and Laurie Metcalf are now legendary. Estelle Parsons, Shelley Winters, Ned Beattie, Sara Gilbert, Martin Mull are just a few of the actors who  helped Roseanne become a seasoned actor. She launched the careers of many people who now control the industry such as Chuck Lorre and Joss Wheedon.
  Yet Roseanne is an insultingly sexist series. It is almost as if Roseanne used this series to get even for every sexist humiliation she ever endured. John Goodman took the brunt of this and it was only due to his remarkable skill as an actor that he manages to maintain dignity in the role. Three times in the series she hits him on the head with a cast iron skillet. In the pilot, Rosie freaks out on Dan because she does all the work and then over the course of 222 episodes we watch Dan cook, clean, repair, parent and support his wife all while working full time. He does it without the bitter sarcasm that Rosie spouts as does the very same things. At least 22 times in the course of nine seasons Roseanne screams at Dan, ""You're such a MAN!!""
  And it isn't just Dan.
  Every male character is written and directed so he's emasculated in some way. DJ is an Eddie Munster. David is a sensitive push-over to Darlene's demanding strong character. Mark is stupid. It isn't just the women who toy with him, David teaches him the wrong rules at football, he flunks out of trade school and where he's raised by the same abusive mother as David, he's given no pass as David is. In one scene where they're playing Scrabble, they actually convince him that oxygen isn't a word. The live audience doesn't laugh; in a horrifying moment of pity the audience says, ""Awwwww.""
  Roll VTA.
  The other men: grandpa Harris is in one episode in season one, then we learn he's cheated on Grandma Harris for twenty years. All of Dan's friends are stupid or hen-pecked, as is clear around the weekly poker table. There is no person more despicable than Tom Arnold's Arnie who cheats, lies, owes money to everyone and is teased about turning Nancy Gay-to say nothing of how he runs out on her by claiming to have been abducted by aliens. Leon (Martin Mull) is gay but in too many stereotypical ways evident in the 90's. In every confrontation with Roseanne he comes across as a fool. Booker (George Clooney as the first boss at Wellmans and Jackie's lover) cheats on Jackie then departs to become the sexiest actor alive. His replacement is the stereotype mysogonist who pushes Roseanne to stage a full shift walk out, closing the first season. Dan Butler is the only male character who's allowed some dignity though he plays a CPA, recently divorced who gets manipulated by Roseanne in an unsuccessful fix-up with Jackie. The  interesting characters are all women and again, it is the skill of actor John Goodman that gave him depth, sincerity and masculinity playing a man in the generation who grew up during the women's rights movement where the rules he was taught as a child about what it is to be a man are no longer applicable. Even Dan's father (Ned Beatty) is an absentee husband and father to Crystal and Lonnie. The only balanced male character is DJ in seasons 9 and 10. An oversight? Or growth.
  In no way are women elevated by denigrating men. In the long run it tears women down. Mary Tyler Moore-the foundation of feminist television- held steadfast to this rule and it worked far better. Lou Grant was an equal partner to Mary Richards. The result is that Mary Tyler Moore is still fresh while Roseanne now looks like a period piece. The more time passes, the more offensive it becomes.
  Okay, this is a bit harsh. But true.
  Other smaller choices make no sense. Roseanne's consistent bad grammar isn't mirrored by anyone with whom she went to school including her sister Jackie or her three eloquent children. This is an affectation from Roseanne ""the stand up"" to Roseanne ""the actor"". It's clear in subtle ways that she ruled that set and it didn't always help.
  Yet the honesty and beauty that keeps coming through is remarkable and the script archivists are the finest ever. The finale to this series is on a par with Newhart and St. Elsewhere. A single beautiful scene acted by Roseanne brings the audience to tears. She does this beneath her own VO and her acting skills are remarkable. To avoid spoilers no more need be said and where there a solid 6 episodes of disappointment in the last season, it's critical to push through because it's more than worth it.
  The entire series is filled with historic, hysterical moments. For beyond the sexism and inconsistencies there is a beautiful honesty here and that makes ""Roseanne"" a classic and well worth owning.",1394150400,,4935,4.6482758620689655

2991337,4,B000WSVBG2,"I got this as a gift for my best friend who grew up watching this show and loves it.  It was a hit and he has already worked his way through the whole thing and back again.  The only complaint he had was the container which was just a box with all of the dvds in paper sleeves.  They weren't held in place in the case or held in nice protective sleeves so there was the possibility of 1. losing a disc or two because all of them are loose, and 2. damaging the disks since the sleeves don't offer protection.  He solved the problem by putting them in a large cd binder he had left over from a purchase a long time ago.

The movies themselves work well and are in perfect condition, I was wanting the complete series so the fact that they are not in the exact dvd cases mattered in the least to me. Anyone who is a Rosanne fan and loves to watch all the reruns on tv and have been looking for the series or even priced each of them individually should know you cannot beat $30.00 for all the seasons.

I kept saying if anybody got it make sure it's the 'Complete Series' in the red box and that it should be the first listing.

I'm very pleased with the item, I wasn't missing any episodes like others have reported. I liked that they all came in their own little sleeves and in one case. I did find out however that, it's hard to get the slips back in correctly after watching them when you want to put it back together/away properly.

2991345,5,B000WSVBG2,"I think people have a hard time making a distinction between Roseanne, the person, and 'Roseanne' the series. Both are polarizing, but one--the show--is simply brilliant.

The show touched on blue collar lifestyle (and comedy) in ways that no other show has been able to do. 'Shameless' and 'The Middle' attempt to do so, but they're hit-or-miss. Mainly misses.

'Roseanne' delved into the ordinary struggles of American life--teenage pregnancy, unemployment, abortion, abusive relationships, teenage runaways, dreams for a better life, alcoholism, rage, coming out. And it was authentic, which at times, made the series sad and serious as opposed to down right hilarious. It was funny, because Roseanne's character was cynical but considering the problems she endured, you couldn't blame her.

The most painful of the series' motifs: hoping for a better life. That's what makes this series one of the best in television.",1392854400,,921,5.381944444444445

2991364,4,B000WSVBG2,"I'll not talk on and on about the show, as anyone looking at this page is likely to be familiar with the show and looking to buy this set, so I'll give you the lowdown.

These are not exactly like the Anchor Bay DVD releases. For instance, Season 1 was issued with the syndicated edits. The rest of the 8 seasons, for the most part, were the original full-length broadcast versions, although some edits and substitutions having to do with music were made in later seasons. The biggest casualty in this was the season 8 premiere, in which the end credit sequence was a sendup of The Patty Duke Show theme featuring Sarah Chalke and the returning Lecy Goranson as the two Beckys, which can still be seen in syndication, but was edited from the Anchor Bay release, and sadly, remains missing in the Mill Creek release. Some, but not all, of the other edits, have been restored in the Mill Creek releases, such as the removal of When You Wish Upon A Star from the Disney World episodes. If you already own the Anchor Bay DVD's, I would just buy the Mill Creek releases of S1 and the seasons known to have music edits, even if all have still not been restored. But if you don't own any seasons whatsoever, this is the cheapest way to get them as opposed to buying them separately.

Each season is presented on 3 DVD discs, with 6-9 episodes per disc. Quality is generally good, with some episodes faring better than others. A couple of episodes on Season 1, including ""Mall Story"" have momentary pixellation where the image breaks up into green or white pixels, but such instances are only about a second long. I haven't noticed this in any other episodes, but I've only finished seasons 1-5 so far. Most of the bonus features from the Anchor Bay DVD releases have been retained. The episodes do not feature subtitles but are closed captioned, which sadly doesn't work on Blu-Ray players or DVD players using component cable setup.

The packaging is not anyone's ideal, let's get that out of the way. It's 27 discs in 27 windowed black paper sleeves stacked on top of one another in a big plastic box with a slipcover over the box. It takes up the shelf space of three standard DVD cases, and one can't help but wish Mill Creek had put this in a slipcase including 3 regular-sized DVD cases, each one containing 3 seasons, to make it a touch more convenient. There are many ways to make it all more convenient, however, so you can pick whichever method of storage you prefer for convenience. I've chosen to keep the discs in the box and just keep one or two seasons out at a time until I've gone through all of them. Also, sadly, there isn't an episode guide to be found inside, but lists of the episodes in each season can be found online and printed off, folded up, and stuck inside the box along with the discs. The paper sleeves can scratch some of the discs in transit, but many players these days can handle DVD's with a few light scratches, or even sometimes not-so-light ones. One disc, which had zero scratches whatsoever, skipped badly in my player and couldn't even be backed up onto the computer. I e-mailed Mill Creek and they sent me a replacement right away, despite their claim that they typically don't replace discs not purchased directly from their website, so if any of your discs don't work, it's worth a shot to e-mail them at the support e-mail givem at millcreekdirect.com

Despite packaging woes and the woes one might have from having up to 9 episodes crammed onto a single DVD (which usually only results in around 3.5 hours of video not sourced from film or HD video, meaning compression isn't a major problem as the quality is never going to be pristine anyway) and occasional built-in glitches or varying quality of episodes, you can't go wrong with this set. Don't buy it for more than around $35, as the packaging isn't worth more than that, but this set can be occasionally found on here for $25-$30. (It was $25.99 when I purchased it.) It's been well worth every penny to have all of my favorite Roseanne moments (sadly minus the two Beckys sketch) at my fingertips. Definitely recommended.",1391040000,45,4120,4.563513513513514

They just stack inside of a secure section of the container that clips them down.

Yes, all of the DVDs are in a single paper sleeve, Yes, the DVDs are not ""held in"" the greatest --- but you get what you pay for.  I actually like the packaging...it is easy to find the DVD that you need because they are all a different color depending on the season, they are all labeled disc 1 - disc 2 - disc 3, and all of the discs are labeled by season.  Come on people, what else do you need.  Sorry this was not wrapped in gold packaging with unicorns and rainbows inside.  I definitely recommend this collection.

Who cares if they don't come in fancy packaging, if you can pay $27.00 for all seasons of Roseanne and of this quality!

I am not missing any discs, and they all play just fine; more than just fine, they look great, considering they were recorded long before the flat screen phenomenon. The episodes are not letter-boxed, but the big square picture fills my flat screen top to bottom, with no stretching or distortion of any kind. The black bands on either side are barely noticeable when the picture is this good. The color is great, and the episodes are absolutely complete, including all of the bits of business that they included before and after the opening and closing credits.

I could go on forever about what I love about Roseanne, but I'm sure since you're here reading this, then you're a fan as well.

When I buy TV shows on DVD, what I like to have is a list of episodes and which discs they are on. I started to buy each individual season of Roseanne but at times they were hard to find. So voila! Here is the complete series! Without hesitation, I bought this and thought it was a steal for the price! Well I soon learned what the price meant: horrible packaging and no episode guide. That may sound picky, but that's what I expect!

I don't have any major complaints with the set itself, I mean I don't like the paper sleeves, or how they are held in place but its not the worst possible idea im sure.  Its a shelf space saver though with this 2 in casing unit.  The quality of the show is pretty good concidering the idea of better quality was around much when the show was filmed.  A few episodes I have come across (in season 6 right now) have some issues with the clarity and all over visual representation but a couple don't take away from the whole package so its worthy of living with.  the audio is very clear, represented in digital 2.0 surround.

This has to be, far and away, one of the funniest, most honest, and reflective sitcoms ever on television. It never quite received the attention it deserved (Best Comedy series Emmy), and that continues today with this horrible packaging. As everyone has stated, the discs are in sleeves and piled on top of each other inside the box. You have to pull out a dozen discs to get to the one you want sometimes. The box has a slipcover, but its very flimsy and cheap. Regardless, you can occasionally find this on here for $25 or so, and it's worth every penny.

And let's not even go to the Patty and Cathy/ Sara Gilbert Sarah Chalke ending missing. I am thrilled to have this. Last surgery I dragged all 8 episodes in to the hospital. Next month...One box. And as far as the packaging, I clipped each season with paper clip as a handle and wrapped a rubber band around it. I then printed an episode guide to and put it in the case. It worked great!",1382486400,,478,4.150537634408602

2991443,4,B000WSVBG2,"I know that a lot of people have a problem with the discs being in paper covers and being in on huge stack but those problems are easily solved.  I purchased a 10 pack of dvd cases that each hold 4 discs.  I then scanned the back and front of the series covers and printed up 6 of each.  I then trimmed the front and back covers from the series package and used it for the seventh DVD case.  After making label strips for the back of each DVD case, that say ""ROSEANNE"" and are numbered from 1 to 7, I inserted one of each into each dvd case. I placed 4 dvds in each case and used a sharpie to number them from 1 to 27.  That way I can keep track of what ones I have already watched.
  If you do not have a scanner or printer, you can simply cut strips for the labels and write the name and number on them by hand.  Again, you may want to use a sharpie and number the discs from 1 to 27.
  These disc also have the ""Play All"" feature that some discs that I have purchased elsewhere do not have; and I love that.  For the money, this series is an awesome deal even if you also purchase the 4-disc, dvd cases on Amazon.

I had sent them a photo of the junk and a statement from the P.O. saying the package had been received in bad condition, but that wasn't good enough to get my money back.  I had to furnish my own packing container and deliver it to the P.O.  They felt paying the return postage met any obligation on their part.

No, it's not bundled in an exact replica of the Conner's couch nor does it come with a replica of their afghan, but for this price it cannot be beat!  It's also got a bunch of extras like the original discs had.  I wish more series would have this budget-minded option available.  My Six Feet Under set is beautiful and comes with a headstone on top.  It doesn't make the show any better that I paid almost $200 for it.  I paid around $30 for 9 seasons of Roseanne and I am fine with it.  What I do is take the discs out season byt season.  So i have the three discs for season 5 out now and will open up the box and take the 3 for 6 out next.  Works fine for me.

2991476,2,B000WSVBG2,I have loved this show since I was a kid. I was happy to see that the complete series was being released at such a reasonable price. I was however VERY disappointed at how it is packaged. This is by far the worst packaging of any DVD box set I have ever seen. You get a plastic case with 27 a stack of individual paper envelopes which contains a DVD. If you were to Drop this when the case is open you are going to have a mess. I some times borrow DVD's to my friends but this is one set I will never borrow out for a fear I will lose one of the DVD's. If your planning on buying this set I would suggest buying some other DVD cases.,1377129600,4,633,3.8396946564885495

It arrived cracked (my fault for not returning to Amazon) but the cheap plastic sleeves that the discs are in are so flimsy and bound by cheap super glue style adhesive.

2991487,4,B000WSVBG2,"Great show, cheap packaging. I'd rather have the show digitally than on disc so as not to have to fumble with discs, and this packaging doesn't make that easy, but this is a fraction of the price of the digital versions, and if, like me, you're re-watching the show in sequence, dealing with the discs is not a big deal. If you want to hunt for a specific episode, then it'll be more of a chore. I posted some pictures of the packaging that show it better than I will be able to describe it, but it's basically 27 discs in paper sleeves stacked inside a 3-deep DVD box.

The picture quality of a few of the episodes of season one were pretty woeful, but so far the rest have been as expected from a non-remastered DVD. I'm happy enough. From what I've read, the episodes are supposed to be uncut. I honestly haven't noticed much footage that I haven't seen before. The special features are entertaining and insightful.

A word of warning: if you're going to stick this on a shelf or watch it over six months, check all the discs first to make sure you're not missing any.

Bottom line, it was just too much of a steal (twenty-eight bucks) to turn down. The cheap price trumps the packaging. I'd bite their hand off if I could pick up Seinfeld at this price, paper sleeves and all.",1375920000,102,1280,4.347280334728033

Since season 9 is included in the set, I don't have to pay separately for a bad season. Packaging is cheap, of course. People can't expect to buy this 9 season series for under $45 and still get high quality packaging. You get what you pay for.

2991497,4,B000WSVBG2,"I am a HUGE Roseanne fan. I had previously purchased seasons 5-9 in their original, individual season sets in 2006-2007. They had the most re-watch value of any DVDs I owned - I watched each season at least six times a year. I even watched them in my hospital room while I was in labour! However, after so much use my original discs are skipping, glitching and some of my favourite episodes are now completely unwatchable. So I was very excited to see the complete set was coming out for such a reasonable price, the cost of what I paid for a single season for nine whole seasons! My set arrived yesterday and, unlike some other reviewers here, I did receive all of the correct discs (I made sure to check after reading reviews!). But I agree, the packaging is pathetic - paper sleeves with no flip-through mechanism for easy viewing. I ditched the case and the flimsy paper sleeves at once and slipped all 27 discs inside a CD wallet so I could easily look through them. It's a pretty cheap fix, so I can't dock many stars for one of my favourite shows of all time. I highly recommend coming up with your own storage solution for this set, because looking for a next disc during a late-night Roseanne marathon does require a simpler option than taking 27 paper sleeves out individually.",1373068800,4,1287,4.504273504273504

All 9 seasons are in there! The box came sealed and new. I haven't tested them out yet but there appear to be no scratches on any of them! The packaging: it does come in a collectors box and yes all the DVDs are in black paper sleeves, they are stacked accordingly to the seasons . I don't find this to be a problem for me at all. I'm willing to deal with that and pay the $30 rather than pay over $200 just to have them all in separate DVD cases. This was seriously a major steal!",1372636800,22,669,4.037593984962406
2991499,5,B000WSVBG2,"I always like Roseanne growing up but now as an adult, in a relationship, and a home owner I appreciate the humor even more! I imagine if I have kids one day my appreciation will grow further. The way the family members interact reminds me of my family, friends and our upbringing. The packaging on this set is simple which I like and some of the discs have commentary by Roseanne reflecting on the episode about to be played which is kinda cool.

2991500,4,B000WSVBG2,"I have just recently became a fair fan of Roseanne. I was too young to watch the original shows, and I didn't like the early reruns. I don't know what it is, but here lately I've found the series hilarious and addicting.

When I saw the complete series box set for a moderate price, I just knew I had to order it. I was pleased with the outer layer of the set, the pictures were great. What I don't like is how the DVDs are stored. When you open the case the DVDs are there on the right side, all 27 of them stacked in one prong. The only thing that doesn't make me too mad is that the DVDs are in little black sleeves where they want get damaged. Other recent complete series box sets have the DVDs in one or two prongs without any protection: examples being Charlie's Angles, Married... with Children, Dawson's Creek, and The King of Queens.

If the DVDs had to be stacked this way, they could've at least made the prong a little bit deeper where you wouldn't have to struggle to put the DVDs in them. Now it would've been better if the DVDs where each in their own flip case, one DVD on each side, only 14 flips. These companies are so cheap nowadays. They finally give us the complete series of our favorite shows, but they're packaged pitifully. But we learn to deal with it if we want these shows.",1372550400,2,1303,4.228915662650603

It's fun watching the kids grow up before our eyes as each season came along, and each has a great future in show biz they can enjoy now and I get to see how they have developed into stars themselves. Roseanne and Dan Conner (John Goodman) were always such an ideal couple. Who else could live with her all those years?

As for the show, of course, if you're a fan, you'll be happy, if you're not, you won't be.",1372204800,,249,3.96
2991505,3,B000WSVBG2,"The series was/is terrific and ages surprisingly well. But if you're in the market for the entire series you probably know that already. Don't expect much from the extras provided herein. Rosanne's commentaries seem to have been recorded at gunpoint or after heavy sedation. I'm not sure it would be possible for her to show more contempt for the process that made her career.
The packaging consists of individual paper and plastic sleeves for the discs. That's fine, but all they do is stack all the discs on top of each other in what amounts to a single tray (box). Keeping the series in any kind of order is redundant. I'm all for getting more shows for less, but this packaging wouldn't have passed muster in Engineering 101 at even the lamest JC. Maybe Rosanne had a hand in it's design as it shows as much respect for the purchaser as she does for the viewer.",1372204800,,865,4.551282051282051
2991506,4,B000WSVBG2,"I had read a review complaining about the packaging - and where I will not be that STRONG about it, I will say - I wish it were done better. Each disc is in a paper disc cover - the way they are, it makes it hard to close the case completely unless things are in there perfect.

everything else about this is great - the price had come down which made my final decision to get the series collection - I love roseanne....lots of similarities to the family I grew up in.",1372118400,2,468,4.032258064516129
2991507,3,B000WSVBG2,"I too, like many others on here have waited for a very long time to have the complete series available in one reasonably priced nice box set.  However, this box set is horribly put together. You really do get what you pay for here.  When it finally arrived, I went right to Season 9 because it had been a long time since I had last seen those episodes...a few days later, I went to watch Season 8 and found that I was missing Season 8, Disc 1, Episodes 1-9 and had instead received two Season 8, Disc 2 dvds.  The missing disc contains some of the BEST episodes: ""the old Becky"" (Lecy) returns; Baby Jerry Garcia is born; DJ has his controversial Thanksgiving Day pageant; and Blues Traveler is in an episode.  As a huge Roseanne fan this is, in my opinion, the worst disc that could be missing from the box set!!

All in all, if you want all episodes in  one package for a low price and do not mind that the package is completely inconvenient to flip through, go for it.  Just make sure to check that you actually do have all episodes in that package AS SOON AS YOU GET IT because you only have a limited return/exchange period!!!

REPLACEMENT BOX-SET ARRIVED:  After viewing Season 8, Disc 1 (and finally paying attention to it), I just noticed something strange on my replacement.  In Season 08, Episode 05 after Roseanne's hallucination at the hospital where she saw Jerry in the monitor's screen this disc plays a DIFFERENT song than I've ever heard before.  On TV and other dvd copies, I have ONLY EVER heard the Grateful Dead's ""Not Fade Away"" being played while people dance around Roseanne in her hospital bed AND in the ending sequence where Roseanne's family picture is shown...however, this disc is playing what I believe to be Jerry Garcia's version of ""Brothers & Sisters"".

Has anyone else had this or similar experiences with this box set??",1371772800,64,1856,4.54054054054054

Having completed viewing the entire series, I must say that it would be better with about 80% less child exposure. The kids are just not funny. The catty relationship between the girls is annoying and DJ doesn't get a joke until season 9. They ended up giving the most air time to the most irritating child, Darlene. The characterization became confused. The scholarly Becky ends up in a trailer park and slacker Darlene goes to college.

2991534,5,B000WSVBG2,"yes sometimes the show can be a little over the top but so can alot of families.  anyones who ever watched the last episode of roseanne would know that the show is even in roseannes (the character not roseanne barr) eyes is ""semi fiction"". (though totall fiction in reality of course)  in the show she was a writer and she was writing her memoirs but changing it up to the way she thinks it would have been better.  darlene was with mark and becky was with david for instance.
they at times one time in particular (""its people like you that give white trash a bad name"" when she took david away from that retched healey woman)admitted to being white trash.  me i think they were just real.  i think alot of people who were so against the show didn't watch the show from beginning to end the way i did.  i watched ever show ever aired and not as reruns.  i grew up watching it.  it was my favorite show since i was a child.  though they weren't sophisticated or perfect (in short they were real) it was a show that had alot of wise cracks, alot of real life situations (covering drugs, underage drinking, coming of age issues, death, domestic abuse and just about everything else) and alot of love.  i think if you look in the cracks youll see a show about a husband and a wife trying the see the humor in issues that life has brought to them.  dan whos a great husband and father with an unconditional love for his children. roseanne a mom who never seemed to forget why she loved her husband and does what she can to balance being a working mom and raising three (in the end 4, 5 if you count david) kids. becky who can be defiant and stubborn like any teenage girl.  darlene who is proof of the apple from the tree theory.  when she is affected she makes a joke out of it but when it hits the fan she recognises it and is there.  i personally think darlene was a good kid.  dj who really came together in the later seasons.  that kid cared alot about his folks in his pre teen years where most kids only care about themselves.  it just mainly came to light when the situations were serious. (dan having a close call at darlenes wedding, roseanne having complications in pregnancy, jackie getting beat). jackie the annoying sister who screws up by talkin too much. she cares tho.  beverly the insane mother whos mistakes in life she never owed up to. david and mark 2 abused boys who wind up marrying the conner girls.
what alot of people see is ""married with children""!
i love the shows.  especially ""radio days"" and ""bridge over troubled sonny"". (being a factory worker myself the first season holds a little somethin special to me what can i say.)",1234051200,,2651,4.3516260162601625

2991537,5,B000WSVBG2,"Roseanne was a popular sitcom from the late eighties and its cast has been given numerous awards for their performances. The series is about a lower class family, living in Lanford, Illinois, struggling through that odd thing we call life. The show has an intrinsic cast and they are a hard bunch not to like. Roseanne looks at some of the most common daily situations from the home and the work place. In most cases these situations turn out to be funny.

3224999,5,B000WSVBG2,"The following is a summary of each of the nine seasons. I offer details of plot developments so be advised there are SPOILERS AHEAD.

Season 1 (5 stars) - If nothing has happened since this season was first released, then this set consists of the cut syndicated versions that are missing the closing minutes of the show. My rating is for the original content, not the cut versions. You can see Roseanne and the cast struggle in the first few episodes trying to get accustomed to ensemble comedy versus her stand-up routine, however the show improves very rapidly and has some great individual episodes. This is the only season where Roseanne and all of her friends work at Wellman's factory - they all walk off the job during the last episode in response to the tyranny of a new factory manager played by Fred Thompson of all people.

Season 2 (5 stars) - This marks the first of the very best seasons of the series, which includes seasons two through four, ending with Becky's marriage to Mark at the beginning of season five and the exit of her character from the show. None of the episodes in this season are klunkers, and the acting and writing are top-notch. A big theme in this year's show is Roseanne trying to find stable employment after she walked off of her factory job at the conclusion of the first season. I especially like how this season handled the real-life issue of what happens to a person like Roseanne who has only a high school education when she loses a factory job that, although adequately-paying, does not provide any experience in doing anything that another employer would find valuable. ""Boo!"" is the first of what became a tradition on Roseanne, which was the Halloween special that occurred every year from this point through the duration of the show.

Season 3 (5 stars) - Season three of Roseanne doesn't revolve around any particular overriding story arc, but the kids are definitely beginning to grow up. The late Glenn Quinn first appears as rebel and smart-mouth Mark Healey in ""Becky, Beds, and Boys"" .Becky's concerned parents forbid her to see Mark anymore, but she keeps coming up with ways to see him anyway. I liked how Mark was portrayed in these early seasons when he was ""Rebel Without a Cause"" as opposed to the last three seasons when he was transformed into ""Rebel Without a Clue"". The other plot developments include Jackie being injured and leaving the police force, Roseanne getting a job at Rodbell's, a diner in the mall, and Dan opening a motorcycle shop of his own.

Season 4 (5 stars) - Season Four of Roseanne has some of the best individual episodes as well as the best overall storyline of any of the show's nine seasons. The season opens with the Conners having opened their motorcycle shop on their own after irresponsible friend Ziggy ran out on them at the last minute last season, Roseanne and Dan have finally accepted Becky and Mark as a couple, Darlene is starting high school, and Jackie has been drifting ever since she left the police force rather than accept a desk job due to her back injury. This season probably does the best job of combining great comedy, hard-hitting drama, and highlighting situations that should look familiar to any member of the middle class. Although this is not the last of the good seasons of Roseanne, I would say season four is the last of the golden years of that series, and definitely worth viewing.

Season 5 (5 stars) - The season starts out on a very morose note that corresponds to the deep recession the country was suffering when these shows aired in 1992. Dan's motorcycle shop is failing and will have to be closed in order for him to salvage the mortgage on the Conner home. Rodbell's, the diner in the mall where Roseanne has worked for two years, is closing too, due to business in the mall being so bad. In order to make ends meet, the kids' college fund has been depleted so that Becky, while filling out college applications, throws a fit when she asks her parents about this fund and finds it no longer exists. She elopes with boyfriend Mark and moves to Minnesota, since with the closing of Dan's shop, Mark is unemployed too. This opens up a crevice in Becky and Dan's relationship that takes months to heal. I compliment the show for incorporating the very bad recession going on in 1992 into the storyline. However, the Conners' troubles came on very suddenly and were resolved with a very pat answer. In retrospect, it all seemed like a somewhat contrived attempt to help Bill Clinton get elected. Just as homeless people didn't seem to exist on TV until Ronald Reagan was elected president, it seemed like everyone in Lanford was on the road to starvation until the outcome of the 1992 election seemed inevitable, and then economic conditions suddenly normalized.

Season 6 (5 stars) - Although this season has some excellent episodes, and overall is a five star season, we begin to see the start of some of the trends that eventually becomes the downfall of the series.  ""A Stash From the Past"", ""The Driver's Seat"", and ""Lies My Father Told Me"" are three of the better individual episodes. One of the better long arcs of the season involves Darlene hiding the fact that David is with her in Chicago, rather than in Michigan with his mother. For the bad part of the season, it seems that this is the beginning of a trend in ""Roseanne"" where men tend to be disposable. Jackie becomes pregnant by one of Dan's coworkers - ""Fred"" - who is never even given the courtesy of a last name, and Mark, previously depicted as an independent-minded and able mechanic is now portrayed as someone who can't even make passing grades in trade school.

Season 7 (4 stars) - Season 7 still has enough good episodes and even some great ones for it to be worthwhile viewing, but it is definitely the beginning of the end. Roseanne begins one of the longest pregnancies in the history of television this season - thirteen months plus the time Roseanne has been pregnant before she announces the news. Next, Jackie discovers Darlene at a motel in the middle of the day, and it turns out that the boy with Darlene is not David, it's a new boyfriend - Jimmy. David says he is OK with it, but Roseanne is not and tells Darlene to make a choice. She does - and dumps a heartbroken David. The whole issue of the broken romance between David and Darlene and its resolution is one of the best parts of the season. One of the worst parts of the season is the Thanksgiving episode when Roseanne's pregnancy looks like it might be in trouble. She screeches at both DJ and Dan every time they offer an opinion as if they are trying to tell her what to do instead of the possiblility that they just want to comfort her and lighten the load. Jackie tires of Fred, whom she married less than a year before, and promptly disposes of him. After a few obligatory appearances in Season 8 he disappears entirely as though he had never existed in the first place.

Season 8 (3 stars) - This season you have to really pick through episodes full of fantasy, inane slapstick, and politically correct undertones to get to the truly good blue collar slice-of-life episodes that made up the majority of episodes in prior years. The season opener, ""Shower the People You Love with Stuff"", very unceremoniously returns Lecy Gorenson as Becky Conner Healy, with Roseanne taking advantage of the sudden replacement with an inside joke by remarking that it seems like Becky's been gone for four years - exactly how long Lecy Gorenson has been gone from the show. The biggest problem with season eight is that Roseanne NEVER did fantasy episodes well during any season, and this season is full of them. It was particularly sad to see what became of the Halloween episode this year, always a Roseanne staple. Gone are the outrageous costumes and the clever pranks of previous years. They have now been replaced by a circus of the absurd and the bizarre.

Season 9 (3 stars) - Many people did not like the ninth season of Roseanne, but in its totality, I found it fascinating. The main problem was that it was clumsily written and directed, and that is mainly why I am giving it three stars. You have to look at this season in the context of Roseanne's actual life. By the ninth season, the show had gradually been losing that genuine quality of a real working-class family for a couple of seasons at least in part because, by 1996, Roseanne herself had not been living a blue-collar lifestyle for over a decade. It was probably much easier for Roseanne to do something she knew - play a woman with a blue-collar background who comes into sudden wealth. Just prepare yourself for more than a few cringe-worthy moments of TV viewing.",1192060800,47,8705,4.6248382923674

3225021,5,B000WSVBG2,I cannot even begin to describe how happy this makes me. 25 dollars for every episode is a steal! Roseanne has always been one of my favorite sitcoms and having every episode on DVD is just amazing. DVDs are great quality and play perfectly on my PS4.

Several of the dvds had scratches on them. This obviously was not a NEW item. Was very disappointment in this item.,1520553600,,328,4.140625

3225031,2,B000WSVBG2,The disk started out playing ok but fuzzy so I gave it a chance and it really never got any better. I changed dvd players but still no difference. I thought the disk would be remastered and clear..I was wrong so I watched them the best I could. Atleast all the episodes were there. I have a 60' tv and it would only play in the center of the tv in a square box in the center of the tv and I tried every setting and nothing would change. They seem cheaply made and for the price im very disappointed especially what I paid for it. What really ticked me off was I see the same exact box set at walmart today at walmart for 21.95 and that really got under my skin compaired to what I purched them on amazon for. No disrespect  but just stating the truth.,1518480000,,751,4.040268456375839

3225050,4,B000WSVBG2,Love this iconic 90's show. I grew up with this show so I'm stoked it's getting a reboot. Since the entire series isn't available on any of my streaming networks I purchased from here. Just be wary when you open the box; the packaging is VERY flimsy! So be prepared.,1515715200,,266,4.34

3225055,5,B000WSVBG2,"Love the show!

About the packaging:
Mill Creek is a budget releasing company, and it shows through with this set. What you get is a stack of discs in sleeves loosely crammed in a holder inside of the large plastic box. The picture quality is also pretty standard definition.",1514678400,,275,4.612244897959184
3225056,3,B000WSVBG2,"I'm giving this three stars due to the packaging and the fact that there are many episodes missing. I grew up watching Roseanne and know almost every episode and I know there is a handful missing, mostly special episodes and some Halloween ones. So it's really not a complete set. Also the packaging is horrid as others have said. The discs are not in order in the case and are in paper sleeves. The discs themselves are low quality and scratch very easily. However, at this price point you do get what you pay for. I am happy to have this in my collection.",1514505600,,557,4.365384615384615
3225057,5,B000WSVBG2,"I was blown away when I saw this box set and the price. The price made me wonder if it was legitimate, but it turned out to be exactly what was advertised.

3225061,4,B000WSVBG2,I love this show. My only complaint is towards the manufacturer. The dvds come in little paper holders rather than something to protect the dvds. Im fearful one day one dvd will get scratched and Ill have to purchase the entire collection for one dvd.,1513036800,,251,4.6

3225063,5,B000WSVBG2,All the episodes ever made of Roseanne from first aired episode to the very last episode ever made! I still cannot believe I own all episodes. It comes in a thick case and each dvd is in it's own dvd slip (which I like because that makes it less likely for them to get scratched). I use to watch this comedy show in the 90's and it's always had me laughing on a roll with every episode. Gotta love Roseanne and the Conor Family!!!,1512518400,,430,4.130952380952381

*Includes all of the episodes from each season
*Amazing Price
*Compact in one box

Cons
*the DVDs are in paper disc holders (one on each side) so the holders can get out of order pretty easily if you drop them
*the holders make it a bit hard to see the DVD title/episode because only half of the DVD shows at a time
* The box and the holder do not protect the DVDs well

I read the other reviews about the shoddy packaging, so I also ordered a zip-up dvd holder with the understanding that the dvd box wasn't well made to begin with. But when it arrived, the whole dvd case was smashed so bad it doesn't even close, it was just hel together with the plastic wrap it came in. all the dvds look fine, but some have some mars on them. Can't tell if they'll be a problem yet, so I'm watching them all first before I decide whether or not I have to return them. If I hadn't also ordered the dvd holder, I would have been royally screwed. It's one thing for the packaging to be sub-par, but mine was so bad it couldn't hold anything anymore. If you love the show, buy this set - it's cheap and the quality is high considering the cameras it was filmed with. Just don't expect the to be able to display the case anywhere.",1493683200,,917,4.186440677966102

This is great show and is well worth having in your DVD collection.  However,  i have noticed on several occasions there have been some edits made too some episodes and certain scenes where there is music involved.  These scents still appeared on the netflix version and the TV versions.
A few tags scenes in season 8 and 9 have been completely removed, while some others have been altered.  Some music in the episodes have been replaced with a different music peace of some sort from its original.

3225136,5,B000WSVBG2,"""Roseanne"" is one of those shows that became an instant classic and it's loved by many!  Seasons 1-6 were great!  Season 7 is when it started slipping in quality.  Season 8 had some really good episodes, plus, Lecy Goranson returned as Becky.  The less said about season 9, the better.  The first few episodes weren't too bad, but, it got ridiculous really fast to the point where it became stupid.  There was too much focus on Roseanne and Jackie.  They were doing all these fancy things and meeting rich people all the time.  It became hard to watch.  Granted, I watched the whole last season, but, I honestly just can't stand it.

Aside from that, the show is great!  Season one had some terrific episodes, especially ""Life and Stuff,"" the series premiere.  The whole kitchen fight scene is great!  ""Oh, but, honey, you just fixed dinner three years ago!""

For me, the best seasons were 1-5.  I didn't really care too much for Sarah Chalke as Becky,  but, I didn't hate her.  I just preferred Lecy Goranson more.

The collection is great, although there could've been more special features.  For the price, it's great!  The picture and sound quality are great!  Highly recommended!",1492560000,,1184,4.733990147783251

The packing is the worst. I got my series in dvd sleeves. Cardboard dvd sleeves. The box was already ripped almost ready to fall apart. How this complete series was released was beyond me.

But just one thing that's bothering me if I would of known that the Roseanne episodes they sell in amazon instant video are not full episodes I would never have buy them I spent like 40 bucks on them and I spent 30 for this whole nine  seasons and they have full episodes if I could get my money back I would.

I'm going to have to buy a whole new case to store the cds in because the way the cds are stored is absolutely horrid and I definitely won't be able to regularly get them out of these annoying individual sleeves without scratching them up. Also I was missing an entire set of episodes, on season five it gave me two disc twos and then a disc three... completely skipped the first disc of that season.

3225265,3,B000WSVBG2,"I had a really hard time rating this show because I absolutely ADORE the first 3 seasons. Not only did this show give an unprecedented mele of humor and reality - especially for those of us who grew up completely differently and really had no idea what it was like for working class families - but the acting was just awesome.

What I especially loved and still love in those first few seasons is the unvarnish, unpretentious approach - no glitz, no glamor, no faking or phoning it in. But, alas, Roseanne soon got fake and the stories became more and more ridiculous - to say nothing of the truly appalling decision to put Sarah Chalke in as Becky. Not only was Chalke absolutely pathetic, lame and not the least bit adept in portraying Becky, but it never ceases to amaze me that she went on to another successful tv show while Lecy Goranson - the original Becky - didn't. But then Goranson pursued a college education at a renowned college, so good for her.

Either way, the show's early episodes were and remain among my absolute favorite things to watch. They're almost raw in their honesty. I still love John Goodman, who I'm glad to see continues to act to this day.",1467072000,5,1173,4.502347417840376
3225266,5,B000WSVBG2,"Loved growing up watching this series and love that I have it available to watch now. The dvd's play great, which is all that really matters when buying them.",1466985600,,158,4.482758620689655
3225267,5,B000WSVBG2,"Honestly, This was a decent price for all the hours, and episode that come with it. Not to mention the Nostalgia factor.  The quality is decent for the video and audio.  Now, that has been said....  I am going to have to state something that I really don't like about it.  But in the end, It is a rather small grievance.

But the case that it comes in is rather crappy.  It comes with a ton of discs, that are only in sleeves.  Not a big deal. But they get scratched easier in sleeves from MY experiences with them.  Plus, I just rather have them in something a bit more held in place than a sleeve.

The front of the case, when I got it was squashed, at some point in it's journey..  So I can see the plastic imprints of inside the case on the outside of it, all through the front cover.  But my biggest issue with it was that,  All's I did was open the case, as you would any other case....  And the plastic tabs inside the case, that these sleeves sit inside.  They busted right off, just from me OPENING the case.  These plastic tabs inside the case are very flimsy and crap-tastic.

But all in all, It was a good purchase.  It's just annoying to fork out any amount of money for something, and to have something on it break in the first 10 minutes of using it.",1466726400,8,1265,4.118852459016393

Each season has three discs each and all of the DVDs work perfectly. This hilarious series is about a blue collar family and their day to day struggles with money, kids, family, marriage and work. Most of it is hilarious and easy to relate to, but some is very heartfelt and hits on some of the harder parts of life like abuse, alcoholism, and infidelity.",1465257600,,524,4.303030303030303

I and been wanting the complete series for a long time (Netflix only has the first 3ish seasons and WE only plays the same 8 random episodes over and over) but when I saw the extreme discounted price, I knew it was time.

3225287,5,B000WSVBG2,"Who doesn't love Roseanne?  She's the perfect representation of so many of our experiences growing up in America in the '90s.  This is a classic show that is appropriate for the whole family and is actually enjoyable for the whole family.  I would recommend this to anyone, although probably not people from outside America as some of it might be confusing or come across brash.  My fiance and I love watching this after dinner, it's a good bonding activity and we grow closer to one another by reminiscing about the references in the show and comparing our own experiences to that of Roseanne and her family.",1463875200,,609,4.716981132075472

Season 4 and on I have to spend 10+ minutes fighting with my player to load the disc to play. And once I get it to play you commit to finishing the disc or battle it out to get it to play.

This show tackled contemporary issues unapologetically with often comedic delivery to drive the moral of the story home. Personally, the earlier seasons were more light hearted and pushed humor more subtley. The last seasonseason in the series werected more dark and broody to me.

3225416,3,B000WSVBG2,"As others have said, the packaging left much to be desired with it's bulk disc nesting and individual paper sleeves but I knew this upon purchasing so I wasn't surprised upon it's receipt. The quality of video was where I was disappointed. Several episodes (5+ total) throughout the seasons have moments of discoloration. The screen will turn blue, purple or green with an occasional ""pop"" or crackle sound and immediately return to normal. I thought I had a malfunctioning system but when I reversed/rewound(?) the counter back to the spot in question we always received the same results, no matter the equipment used. In the end, due to the hassle of shipping and the limited occurrences, I decided to keep the set. Eh, it's still a fun rewatch.",1447891200,3,747,4.84375

However I was not impressed with the discs itself. They are all stacked on top of each other and only have a few episodes per disc, thus the large amount of CDs. The quality was so so. It was either season two or three that had a really low volume. Anyways, I actually returned our set because all of these reasons and the fact that my plastic casing was cracked. Maybe if they ever decide to update the series to blu ray, I'd buy it and keep it.",1447372800,,577,3.9827586206896552
3225421,4,B000WSVBG2,Love Roseanne! Only problem I had with this set was on one of the discs on I think season 6 or 7 it is completely missing one episode.

3225443,5,B000WSVBG2,"My box came in very good condition; each disc came inside its own sleeve, all stacked on top of each other with season 1, disc 1 being on top. All 9 seasons are here. Every disc says which season it is and is labeled disc 1, 2 or 3 (As in Season 2 disc 3)

 I can see why people don't like the packaging  since the sleeves are just cheap paper ones. I recommend getting a CD/DVD holder. (Kinda like a photo album, I'm sure you know what I'm talking about) all together there is 27 DVDs so buy a 28 disc holder (around 7-9 dollars) and it'll be a lot easier when having to put in the next DVD while watching.

The actual quality of the DVDs are great! I'm so happy to be watching all the episodes in chronological order!

Seriously; if you love this show; buy this. It's well worth the money! Just remember about the packaging and just buy the disc holder. 5 stars for DVD quality; and hey, that's the most important thing here.",1442016000,6,927,4.156424581005586

The episodes are manufactured like buying each individual season.  Who cares about the packaging and for the price EXCELLENT!  Now if you can give me Golden Girls and Designing Women in the same concept and price I would be elated. A great Christmas gift for any Roseanne fan!,1437091200,,454,4.433734939759036

This is a giant pack of CDS, and they are all in cheap paper sleeves that aren't really bound into the case. They sit in this little square insert that isn't quite big enough to keep the top couple from poking out and there's no way to keep them permanently in order. I kind of expected more of a box set, like bound-in plastic sleeves at least.

3225542,3,B000WSVBG2,"I bought this set for my spouse as the more fan of Roseanne.  Although the episodes were enjoyable and I heard a lot of laughter from the vicinity of the TV (myself providing some of that laughter), it was not all a bed of roses.

What cost this set 2 stars were 2 problems:

1:  The menu control of all disks in the set was so slow you felt like you could watch an episode waiting for it to load one!  I've purchased many DVDs (individuals and sets) and have never seen such slow response and if you accidentally hit stop twice -- BEWARE!  This added a level of frustration that offset much of the fun of the series.

2:  Although there were some scenes seen that were not remembered (maybe having viewed some episodes on repeat/syndication where some small items may have been cut out) there were also areas where parts seem to be missing or cut out.  The most noticeable one is one that has been reported in these reviews already -- the ending of the 8th season episode that showed the 2 Beckys like the old Pattie Duke show.  Instead of the montage of scenes, a black background was seen behind he closing credits.

How can you call it ""The Complete Series"" with parts cut out and/or changed?",1427155200,5,1196,4.366515837104072

3225544,5,B000WSVBG2,"This complete ""Roseanne"" is excellent. Contrary to a few other comments, we *like* the fact that each disc has its own sleeve. This assures long term protection, and we wish more large sets adopted this obvious method. As for having to flip through all the discs to find the episode you want, the package design makes location easy, and return to the proper order is simple, too.
We checked all the discs to be sure there were no blanks as some other buyers had reported. So far we're delighted to have the entire series of one of our favorite all time-shows, all at a remarkably low cost.",1426636800,,589,4.514018691588785
3225545,5,B000WSVBG2,"Love this show one of my favorites it got dramatic at times but for the most part it was very funny hilarious even at times.

I agree with a lot of people though I liked the last season...in parts but overall it was an unmitigated disaster.

I tend to just look at seasons 1-7 as the real seasons of Roseanne and pretend like the last season was merely a nightmare.

The final season ruined a lot of the show and quite frankly was not needed it could have ended after the 7th season but they decided to go one more round.

In doing so they destroyed the whole show : the concept of what the show was about in the first place .

The ending of Roseanne also? That ending? Phew suffice it to say it was....horrible.

All I can say is if you expect a happy ending for the show please think again.

I won't ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it I just ask that people go into this show with a fair level head enjoy the comedy and enjoy the golden age of Roseanne in the beginning and stop when you get close to the last season.

Believe me it would have been better that way.

The complete series is packed with interviews bloopers and every episode is uncut and unedited which is awesome considering most of these complete series nowadays are cut to shreds and tarnished .",1426550400,2,1268,4.206611570247934

3225564,5,B000WSVBG2,"Roseanne has always been a child-hood favorite of mine which brought me endless laughter and its the reason why I would always be glued to the TV anytime a Roseanne re-run came on.  That same magnetism or glue is what brought me here and why I couldn't be happier with this complete set.  Since I started streaming Roseanne on Netflix, I was hooked.  However their collection only contained the earlier seasons and thus, like a fiend, I had to have the complete set.  When I saw this, I was sold, esp. at its price.  Wowser!  This is the complete series and although the packaging is a bit flimsy, it more than does the job for what's required.  It's all there and intact.  Plus, at this price, how can you beat it?  The discs even include extras like bloopers and cast interviews.  This is just an added bonus for an already substantial set--and each episode is in the best quality they can be in (with the later seasons teetering more towards higher quality).  The packaging is not the best but it does the job; its minimal but its part of the reason why this set is cheap.  Where else would you found a baffling 9 seasons (27 discs) of a show for under $30.  Think about it, that's a little more than a $1 per disc.

It's Roseanne, one of the most real and hilarious sitcoms of its day and its why it got all the acclaim and popularity it did when it was aired.  This set is perfect to reminiscence in the glory days of 80/90s TV and have a good laugh at the end of the day.  The beauty of Roseanne is that it encompasses more than just laughs, their was a stark realism to it which also integrates drama, real-life wisdom with close-to-heart/home messages.  Also, it recognizes its flaws like in life and instead of masking them, the show really embraces them--often making light of the situation with mockery/sarcasm or capping it off with a wholesome message.  Also, you'll soon realize how brilliant some of their performances are--each cast perfect for their role with hilarity and sarcasm with Roseanne and uncanny humor at the center.  With some being pivotal, John Goodman namely with performances that it seems only he could pull off.  Also, Laurie Metcalf pulls of some stops where she is truly in her element; always on the fringe of collapse while being hilarious.  A role that's probably a lot harder to pull off than she makes it seems.  Other worthy mentionables are Sara Gilbert who has this dark yet sarcastic wit that she executes with great timing.  Oh and of course Roseanne Barr, who is great at writing setups and punchlines that are really at the core of the show--she has a timeless humor and has a gift of tireless laughter.",1425340800,2,2652,4.536842105263158
3225565,5,B000WSVBG2,For the price paid I can live with the dvds being in paper sleeves. Got every episode and all discs work (tested them all out). Other reviews said they had issues but this came perfect and we have been watching a few episodes each night and it is just like watching them back in the day. Made me laugh all over again here and there. I haven't seen some of these episodes since I was a teenager and it is interesting how different I see some things now like how Becky acted or what the adults thought was funny and I didn't. Makes me realize how old I am getting seeing some of these styles in clothing and hair. Great show that I am enjoying watching all over again thanks to this fabulous box set.,1425340800,,698,4.177777777777778

I would REALLY like a version that has been watched, scrutinized and approved for sale. There are episodes from every single season of this collection that will not play. May I remind you, this is 10 years of a series that I haven't even watched yet, If  you can verify every episode is not going to skip/scratch/skew than I will happily re-review and re-rate your series offering.",1425254400,,705,4.423076923076923

It would be a better idea to buy each of the seasons separately.  All of the discs are in paper jackets and squeezed into this little square compartment.  I would think for a successful tv show like this that they would be able to have it in better cases.  Like I said the individual seasons are packaged well.  Setting that aside there are some good commentaries done by Roseanne and extras on the dvds.,1425254400,,525,4.371134020618556

3225573,4,B000WSVBG2,"There isn't much to be said about this classic sitcom that hasn't been written a million times.  It's a comedy giant right up there with the very best.  When I saw this package priced for $28.99 I could not believe my eyes.  How is that this TV classic is priced so low for the entire series while other classic comedy giants retail for well over $100.00 for complete series sets?  I decided I didn't care and purchased it.  It came today, a day before it was expected.

The outer shell is sturdy plastic and I expect it to hold up well and look great on my collection shelf.  When I opened the shell I realized one reason this set may be priced so low.  The discs are not held in standard DVD casing.  They're packaged in individual paper sleeves.  I have a problem with this for a few reasons.  1) I like things to be in order and it will be very easy for these discs to become out of order, 2) it will be more difficult to keep track of discs I've watched as I'm progressing through, and 3) while there are inside plastic clips that hold the stack of paper sleeves in place I suspect it would be very easy to damage these.

I did test the first disc, the last disc, and four random discs throughout just to make sure they played okay.  Obviously I do not have time to test all 27 discs and 222 episodes.  Despite the questionable packaging I highly recommend anyone pick this series up.  If the complete series is ever re-released with better packaging I'm sure the price will skyrocket.",1424995200,2,1490,4.309352517985611
3225574,4,B000WSVBG2,"Rosanne is a classic in TV and this review will not cover such a great show. However this will cover the packing of the discs in this complete set. I was very disappointed to see that the discs came in removable black sleeves and simply laid on the box itself. While this style of packing may of been common about 10 years ago, I expected more. It makes it difficult to actually keep track of what discs you have watched and what you have not.

The menus are nice and perfect for a complete tv series collection. To have the entire series and it contains full episodes not chopped up missing scene episodes like what it aired in syndication. My collection contained every disc not like others who unfortunately didn't receive certain ones. The quality of each disc is awesome I have no complaints. Having all the discs together in one small box is nice. Others complained because it's basically loose DVDs in a stack, in which each disc has it's own sleeve. Which it is. but it doesn't bother me at all I'm thankful to have the entire series in one place. I actually wish other collections would come this way because I would buy them immediately. Again if you are a fan of the show, and for this price you truly can't pass it up! I also tested the DVDs through out as suggested... No problems at all Thanks!",1423353600,,999,4.524861878453039
3225600,5,B000WSVBG2,"I absolutely love this show! So glad I found the entire series on Amazon. I did read some reviews on here that said that when the customer received the set they were either missing discs or had blank disc. So as soon as mine came in my wife and I checked every disc. It took about 30 minutes to go through them but everyone played and none were missing. Some people complained about the paper slips that the discs set in but I said for the price and considering so many DVD's, They done a pretty good job. Yes you could get another series of a different show that might actually have hard cases but you are also going to pay 3 times as much if not more. The format is not HD but thats ok because its not on netflix either which only has the first two seasons. Overall you cant beat the price! I would suggest anyone who likes Roseanne to buy this, however i would recommend doing as my wife and i did. Check every DVD to make sure they play and are all there.

3225601,5,B000WSVBG2,"What a great deal for the entire uncut series of ""Roseanne."" While this set didn't go overboard on deluxe packaging or a lot of extras, for the price I think this is a really decent set. Before I ordered it, I noticed a lot of people commenting about all of the discs stacked up together in paper sleeves. A couple of my sleeves were a bit bent, but all of the discs were in great shape and played well. Make sure you check all of them when you first open it and inspect for broken discs or missing/duplicate DVDs. The episodes from every season were the originals and not the chopped up ones they show in syndication. Some of the discs had extras that were produced for the single season DVD releases, and mostly include mini interviews with some of the cast (Roseanne, Laurie Metcalf, John Goodman, Alicia Goranson, Michael Fishman; the only big absence from the main cast - in the extras - was Sara Gilbert), and Roseanne (occasionally with Michael Fishman) provided sporadic commentary for a handful of the episodes. Hopefully someday there might be a nicer set with a lot more extras, but for the price, you can't beat this collection of the entire series with the original broadcast episodes.",1423267200,6,1198,4.629107981220657

3225611,5,B000WSVBG2,"Roseanne is of course famous for pushing the envelope--a habit I seem to have adopted, and she's a direct influence. At this time I've only reached season 3 of my reminiscences of the series; but that's only because I enjoy studying the assortedly recurring and/or constantly renovated familial household props (especially Godzilla, and Son of Godzilla, on the shelf behind the perpetually quilt-draped couch--the quilt of which continues to prod us with blue-collar mentality, even after they win the lottery; also, the insistent botherances of all those magnetically lurched fridge drawings, which never seem to tire of shedding and procreating with the passage of the sitcom children's scholastic years). But more than that is the intentionally impositional idea that one can overcome popular opinion and still survive.
In short, the unique blossoming of Sara Gilbert, the subtle and yet in-your-face John Goodman, the brilliantly theatrical overboard Laurie Metcalf, and, of course, ""Our Rosie"" (the title of probably my favorite episode)--all seem to take us exactly where we want to be led: to a finer and less indistinct sitcom than all the other shows of its time.

While backing them up I noticed 1 of the discs skipped. I forget which disc it was but it was at the end of the season 5 episode where Dan gets arrested for beating up the guy who hit Jackie. I immediately contacted the Mill Creek customer service. At fist they were awesome. They sent me out a replacement and even a free gift( That 70's Show: Best of Kelso.)
So I put the replacement disc in and sure enough it skips in the very same place as the first one. So I email their customer service again. To my relief they sent me out a second replacement that they ""had verified to be working and also a second Best of Kelso DVD, gee thanks? So anyways I was sure that since they verified it to be in playing order  I had nothing to worry about. So I put it in and bam it skips in the same darn place, not even joking folks.  Three discs all skip in the same place and all 3 replicated on 5 other DVD/Bluray players  So I emailed Mill Creek again and I was told ""there was nothing further they could do for me on this package.""

Because the dvd,1001 Classic Commercials is also packaged like this.
What drew me to this was the price for all 27 discs,plus i also have learned to love this show.
I like Roseanne's quick wit when it comes to situations.
I don't know about having Jackie literally around all the time and Chrystal too that can't be good for the marriage,but i guess i'm wrong on that account.
I guess that among many things made this program.
I really don't see a problem about playing these just be real careful when removing them from those sleeves.

Each disc is in a well-constructed (some others have call them ""flimsy""...I don't know why) black envelope with a clear circular window. The discs are inside a sealed DVD case. To make life easy, when I finish watching a disc, I simply put it at the bottom of the stack. When all DVD's have been watched, you're back in order from the top down.

3225751,5,B000WSVBG2,"I bought this earlier this summer and watched the whole series (except I skipped parts of Season 9, it was so bad).  I was a fan of the series when it originally aired, and it is still so funny.  It's a loving family (not just heartless or hateful people), however they also throw harsh zingers at each other all the time.  The humor is rude, a lot, but that's often what made me laugh so hard.  And the fact that at the end of the day they were still a loving family.

Seasons 1-6 were just a blast, with a few laugh out loud moments in each episode (so bad that you have to pause the show until you stop laughing so hard).  Seasons 7 and 8 were still pretty good, but things were getting weird, the characters on the show were more stressed, Jacky never could find happiness, etc, and that just kind of slowed things down.  However, seasons 7 and 8 were still funny and entertaining.

Season 9, oh God.  They tried to have fun and get artsy (and political) with season 9, but it just didn't work.  Too many fantasy episodes, and that works with animated shows, but not shows with a strong running storyline week-to-week (the fantasy stuff just feels like an interruption).  And season 9's jokes just didn't have the zing that actually made them clever or funny.  I tried to force myself to watch season 9, but after a while I started skipping half of episodes, hoping the next one would be good, and later skipped several episodes just to see the finale (which just ended badly).  However, you're getting 8 other good seasons with the package, so you're still getting a good value.

The packaging is kind of crappy, though I imagine it keeps the cost of the product down (and saves storage room on my DVD rack), so the packaging doesn't bother me that much.",1406160000,,1759,4.405572755417957

All of the discs are packaged in a paper slip and stacked on top of one another in the case. The case also take a bit of work to close. If the discs were packaged better it would be a 5 star rating!

3225771,4,B000WSVBG2,"This set is a great bargain. The discs play well and you can play the episodes continuosly on the disc if you like. I don't mind that the discs come in a sleeve and stacked-it saves money! It's fun to watch the first couple seasons and find a couple minutes that are ""new"" to me because they edit those parts out on tv! The first 4 or so seasons are really great episodes. The 5th & 6th are ok. The last seasons I don't care for that much-especially the last one!",1403913600,,463,4.0989010989010985

3225774,5,B000WSVBG2,"This is by fat the best 27.00 I have ever spent.  Growing up, this show was a staple in our house, and it's great to see that it has aged so well!

The episodes are not digitally remastered, but they don't look bad.  Audio is in stereo and picture isn't terrible at all.

The casing is a slight annoyance. It's a giant dvd case with each disc individually wrapped in a black paper envelope.  Each disc set has different art, so you never have to guess which disc you're putting in.

Bonus materials are on the final disc of each season.  These contains interviews and other fun featurettes.

All in all, it's totally worth the money I spent.  I love this show and I love this boxed set!",1403395200,3,686,4.296875

3225780,4,B000WSVBG2,Any fan of Roseanne should have this.  The only downside is that the case is junk.  The DVDs are kept in paper sleeves and are not attached to the actual case so they can easily get jumbled up if you aren't careful.  I got it for less than $30 at the time so the price is great but know that it's cheap because no effort was put into the packaging.,1401321600,,348,3.942857142857143

3225785,1,B000WSVBG2,"I already owned some individual season's of this show put out by Anchor Bay. I was hoping to get the complete series with the same quality, & boy was I ever mistaken. These DVD's are put out by Mill Creek, & they are by far the poorest quality on the market, I had several discs freeze, skip & flat out not work right out of the box. I had purchased DVD's of other shows put out by this company with the same disappointment. I am surprised this company is still in business & will continue to be if we keep purchasing there products. The outer sleeve states CC, which I was under the understanding that meant closed captioning, NO, that is not what it means on these discs. The DVD's put out by Anchor Bay do have closed captioning, & I would suggest anyone looking to purchase quality DVD'S, look for the ones put out by Anchor Bay & not waste your money on these.",1399420800,27,865,4.248484848484848

3225787,5,B000WSVBG2,"I love this series and am very happy with my purchase. I actually like that it comes in one case with the dvds in sleeves, it takes up much less space than 9 separate cases! I also don't understand why some people are unhappy with the sleeves when the pictures of the product clearly show exactly what the item looks like. I love my set and would recommend it!",1398988800,2,360,4.231884057971015
3225788,4,B000WSVBG2,Roseanne is one of my favorite shows and I was glad to find the complete series. The only downside is absolutely terrible packaging. It's a giant DVD case filled with 27 DVDs in paper sleeves that aren't attached to the case in anyway so expect some to fall out when you first open it.,1398816000,,285,4.296296296296297
3225789,5,B000WSVBG2,"The first four seasons of Roseanne are the best in my opinion. They are Roseanne sort of like before the meltdown. Seasons 5 to 7 are pretty good, but somehow the pace, and the face, of the show has changed. Roseanne seems more acerbic and thanks to botched plastic surgery, she has undergone a rather rapid physical change and with that I mean her face. But it is still good and hilarious, Seasons 8 and 9 , and especially 9, are unwatchable. The wsohw ventures into absurd territory.

Overall this is an amazing show; very ahead of its time, witty, smart and sensitive. Things just really got bad later on as it is often the case with long-rnning shows.",1398729600,,655,4.504201680672269
3225790,1,B000WSVBG2,Several of the dvds came already scratched. I qas really disappointed when I realized that several of them couldn't be watched. I probably won't order a set that I like again.,1398643200,4,175,4.67741935483871

3225793,5,B000WSVBG2,The series bought separately is far overpriced. I was ecstatic to find this set at a reasonable cost. I had issues with an episode not playing - but 2 or 3 out of the series isn't too bad in my opinion. Since I know every episode by heart :),1397779200,,241,3.938775510204082
3225794,5,B000WSVBG2,I got this as a birthday gift after it had been sitting in my wish list for months.  It arrived in perfect condition and a day earlier than expected.  I get that people don't love the packaging but I don't have a problem.  The discs are protected and the entire series takes up about as much space as three seasons instead of nine.  I love that I have Rosie to watch whenever I want!,1397692800,,383,4.135135135135135
3225795,3,B000WSVBG2,This is tricky.  The price is good for the full season BUT......the set I received is missing the 1st disc of Season 1.  Now.....in all fairness...I did contact Amazon.  They have sent me a replacement set and directions/return label so I can return the defective set.  They were very apologetic and helpful.  I should have my replacement set next week.,1397692800,,353,4.816666666666666

3225797,5,B000WSVBG2,"I love Roseanne. One of the TV stations started running a few episodes everyday and I had to watch it or record it so I could watch later. Doesn't matter how many times I have seen the episodes I will sit and watch again and enjoy it just as much as the first time. Which is why I finally broke down and purchased the complete series.

I know a lot of people don't like the minimalist packaging but I find it to be a bonus. You get 9 seasons but only takes up the space of 3 normal DVD cases, and it's not some outrageous price. It's very affordable and takes up little space on the shelf. It doesn't have a ton of bonus features but the ones included are worth watching. An extra bonus I have discovered is that each episode contains 1 or more scenes that for whatever reason are not included when on network tv.

I did make sure to inspect each disc when I received it and put each one in the player to make sure they all played and were the correct discs. Everything was perfect and I have watched through to season 7 now with now skips or freezes.

It arrived shrink wrapped and in a tight fitted cardboard package. There was no damage and it arrived 3 days earlier than expected. Overall I'm completely satisfied with this purchase. I wish other series would start offering more affordable season & series options. Not everyone wants to spend a fortune on overpriced ""collector's"" packaging.",1397520000,2,1396,4.382239382239383

3225803,5,B000WSVBG2,"When I was a kid, I would stay up late just to watch Roseanne. If another tv  show came on I usually turned the tv off to go down by the river, but when Roseanne was on, man nor god could tear my eyes away from the screen. I'm still as much into Roseanne as I was back then, she is a wonderful mother and a great wife. She inspired me to be a great dad to my son and a wonderful husband to my wife. She has always helped me look on the brighter side of life even in the darkest of times. Roseanne is an amazing family fun wholesome show with great family morals that is extremely rare nowadays, I would recommend Roseanne to anyone who asked. I'd give her 10 stars if it was allowed. She helped and still helps me to be the best that I can be on a daily basis. I find comfort in knowing that my son will grow up watching the same tv show that made me who I am today. The product was well wrapped, no scratches, and in excellent condition. It came in that bubble wrap and 2 days ahead of schedule. I would definitely order from this seller again!",1396483200,,1045,3.9761904761904763
3225804,5,B000WSVBG2,"I would recommend this collection to any Roseanne fan, or even any fan of great classic family sitcoms.  I was younger when Roseanne aired on TV & really didn;t watch it.  I'm a HUGE fan of Halloween & on a whim bought the Roseanne Halloween episodes at Sam's Club.  After watching that DVD (repeatedly!) I realized what a great show this is!  Honestly this is a hilarious show, depicting real life for most of us.  She's not afraid to point out alot of the lows middle class families experience & it makes you realize you're not alone.  Brilliant show.  I agree with some of the other buyers about the packaging.  It is a little annoying.  There's one big plastic box that contains all of the DVD's.  Each individual DVD is in a little paper sleeve.  So of course you'll end up flipping through a million little DVD's to find the one you want.  But each season has it's own design on the DVD & they're different colors, so it didn't bother me too much.  Overall, this is a great deal on some great entertainment!

3225812,4,B000WSVBG2,"In reality the best part about this set is the price. This series has been bought for my wife a couple times because she plays it so much. It's her favorite show. And when I last bought it, it was about $30 a season, so this is an amazing deal. The only negative really is the actual packaging. The discs are in cheap paper sleeves and they're all just snapped into one big square inside the main box. But that's probably why it's so cheap. The DVD's all seem to play ok with no problems. I guess the only other weird thing is she said some of the episodes contain slightly different content than her other series DVD's she's had in the past. Nothing major, but she's watched them enough for me to trust her when she tells me something's different. So I guess that's the one thing I would be most disappointed in. Why would it be different? I wish they would just say, ""Directors Cut"" or ""Early Cut"" or ""Who knows what cut"" or whatever. It's just weird, ya know?",1395532800,2,962,4.291208791208791

3225819,5,B000WSVBG2,"I think the reason people enjoy watching Roseanne is so they can feel better about themselves, or they can relate to the characters on the screen.

Being that it was an outside paper cover and not the actual DVD case, I looked past it for a moment. My husband I and began watching the first few DVDs on the first season when suddenly on the episode where Darlene's appendix bursts, the DVD stopped working. Completely. Pulled it out of the player, looked perfectly fine. Put it back in tried getting it past that point and nothing. Hasn't worked at all.

For how little you are paying for this entire series is pretty awesome in my opinion. You buy this to be able to watch the series...not because you hope to have amazing packaging.

All of my discs where there and were completely damage free. What more could I ask for?

I have always loved this series and have always wanted to own it. Thats why when I saw the complete series for sale I hauled ass and grabbed it. True fans of the show won't be disappointed with this purchase!",1394841600,,678,4.1603053435114505

3225829,4,B000WSVBG2,"ROSEANNE
Roseanne Barr did a lot for women's rights and for nine seasons at the end of the 20th Century she helped to re-define women and working class America. Most of the credit for her effectiveness came from the ensemble surrounding her. Actors like John Goodman and Laurie Metcalf are now legendary. Estelle Parsons, Shelley Winters, Ned Beattie, Sara Gilbert, Martin Mull are just a few of the actors who  helped Roseanne become a seasoned actor. She launched the careers of many people who now control the industry such as Chuck Lorre and Joss Wheedon.
  Yet Roseanne is an insultingly sexist series. It is almost as if Roseanne used this series to get even for every sexist humiliation she ever endured. John Goodman took the brunt of this and it was only due to his remarkable skill as an actor that he manages to maintain dignity in the role. Three times in the series she hits him on the head with a cast iron skillet. In the pilot, Rosie freaks out on Dan because she does all the work and then over the course of 222 episodes we watch Dan cook, clean, repair, parent and support his wife all while working full time. He does it without the bitter sarcasm that Rosie spouts as does the very same things. At least 22 times in the course of nine seasons Roseanne screams at Dan, ""You're such a MAN!!""
  And it isn't just Dan.
  Every male character is written and directed so he's emasculated in some way. DJ is an Eddie Munster. David is a sensitive push-over to Darlene's demanding strong character. Mark is stupid. It isn't just the women who toy with him, David teaches him the wrong rules at football, he flunks out of trade school and where he's raised by the same abusive mother as David, he's given no pass as David is. In one scene where they're playing Scrabble, they actually convince him that oxygen isn't a word. The live audience doesn't laugh; in a horrifying moment of pity the audience says, ""Awwwww.""
  Roll VTA.
  The other men: grandpa Harris is in one episode in season one, then we learn he's cheated on Grandma Harris for twenty years. All of Dan's friends are stupid or hen-pecked, as is clear around the weekly poker table. There is no person more despicable than Tom Arnold's Arnie who cheats, lies, owes money to everyone and is teased about turning Nancy Gay-to say nothing of how he runs out on her by claiming to have been abducted by aliens. Leon (Martin Mull) is gay but in too many stereotypical ways evident in the 90's. In every confrontation with Roseanne he comes across as a fool. Booker (George Clooney as the first boss at Wellmans and Jackie's lover) cheats on Jackie then departs to become the sexiest actor alive. His replacement is the stereotype mysogonist who pushes Roseanne to stage a full shift walk out, closing the first season. Dan Butler is the only male character who's allowed some dignity though he plays a CPA, recently divorced who gets manipulated by Roseanne in an unsuccessful fix-up with Jackie. The  interesting characters are all women and again, it is the skill of actor John Goodman that gave him depth, sincerity and masculinity playing a man in the generation who grew up during the women's rights movement where the rules he was taught as a child about what it is to be a man are no longer applicable. Even Dan's father (Ned Beatty) is an absentee husband and father to Crystal and Lonnie. The only balanced male character is DJ in seasons 9 and 10. An oversight? Or growth.
  In no way are women elevated by denigrating men. In the long run it tears women down. Mary Tyler Moore-the foundation of feminist television- held steadfast to this rule and it worked far better. Lou Grant was an equal partner to Mary Richards. The result is that Mary Tyler Moore is still fresh while Roseanne now looks like a period piece. The more time passes, the more offensive it becomes.
  Okay, this is a bit harsh. But true.
  Other smaller choices make no sense. Roseanne's consistent bad grammar isn't mirrored by anyone with whom she went to school including her sister Jackie or her three eloquent children. This is an affectation from Roseanne ""the stand up"" to Roseanne ""the actor"". It's clear in subtle ways that she ruled that set and it didn't always help.
  Yet the honesty and beauty that keeps coming through is remarkable and the script archivists are the finest ever. The finale to this series is on a par with Newhart and St. Elsewhere. A single beautiful scene acted by Roseanne brings the audience to tears. She does this beneath her own VO and her acting skills are remarkable. To avoid spoilers no more need be said and where there a solid 6 episodes of disappointment in the last season, it's critical to push through because it's more than worth it.
  The entire series is filled with historic, hysterical moments. For beyond the sexism and inconsistencies there is a beautiful honesty here and that makes ""Roseanne"" a classic and well worth owning.",1394150400,,4935,4.6482758620689655

The only complaint he had was the container which was just a box with all of the dvds in paper sleeves.  They weren't held in place in the case or held in nice protective sleeves so there was the possibility of 1. losing a disc or two because all of them are loose, and 2. damaging the disks since the sleeves don't offer protection.  He solved the problem by putting them in a large cd binder he had left over from a purchase a long time ago.

I kept saying if anybody got it make sure it's the 'Complete Series' in the red box and that it should be the first listing.

I'm very pleased with the item, I wasn't missing any episodes like others have reported. I liked that they all came in their own little sleeves and in one case.

3225842,5,B000WSVBG2,"I think people have a hard time making a distinction between Roseanne, the person, and 'Roseanne' the series. Both are polarizing, but one--the show--is simply brilliant.

The show touched on blue collar lifestyle (and comedy) in ways that no other show has been able to do. 'Shameless' and 'The Middle' attempt to do so, but they're hit-or-miss. Mainly misses.

'Roseanne' delved into the ordinary struggles of American life--teenage pregnancy, unemployment, abortion, abusive relationships, teenage runaways, dreams for a better life, alcoholism, rage, coming out. And it was authentic, which at times, made the series sad and serious as opposed to down right hilarious. It was funny, because Roseanne's character was cynical but considering the problems she endured, you couldn't blame her.

The most painful of the series' motifs: hoping for a better life. That's what makes this series one of the best in television.",1392854400,,921,5.381944444444445

3225861,4,B000WSVBG2,"I'll not talk on and on about the show, as anyone looking at this page is likely to be familiar with the show and looking to buy this set, so I'll give you the lowdown.

These are not exactly like the Anchor Bay DVD releases. For instance, Season 1 was issued with the syndicated edits. The rest of the 8 seasons, for the most part, were the original full-length broadcast versions, although some edits and substitutions having to do with music were made in later seasons. The biggest casualty in this was the season 8 premiere, in which the end credit sequence was a sendup of The Patty Duke Show theme featuring Sarah Chalke and the returning Lecy Goranson as the two Beckys, which can still be seen in syndication, but was edited from the Anchor Bay release, and sadly, remains missing in the Mill Creek release. Some, but not all, of the other edits, have been restored in the Mill Creek releases, such as the removal of When You Wish Upon A Star from the Disney World episodes. If you already own the Anchor Bay DVD's, I would just buy the Mill Creek releases of S1 and the seasons known to have music edits, even if all have still not been restored. But if you don't own any seasons whatsoever, this is the cheapest way to get them as opposed to buying them separately.

Each season is presented on 3 DVD discs, with 6-9 episodes per disc. Quality is generally good, with some episodes faring better than others. A couple of episodes on Season 1, including ""Mall Story"" have momentary pixellation where the image breaks up into green or white pixels, but such instances are only about a second long. I haven't noticed this in any other episodes, but I've only finished seasons 1-5 so far. Most of the bonus features from the Anchor Bay DVD releases have been retained. The episodes do not feature subtitles but are closed captioned, which sadly doesn't work on Blu-Ray players or DVD players using component cable setup.

The packaging is not anyone's ideal, let's get that out of the way. It's 27 discs in 27 windowed black paper sleeves stacked on top of one another in a big plastic box with a slipcover over the box. It takes up the shelf space of three standard DVD cases, and one can't help but wish Mill Creek had put this in a slipcase including 3 regular-sized DVD cases, each one containing 3 seasons, to make it a touch more convenient. There are many ways to make it all more convenient, however, so you can pick whichever method of storage you prefer for convenience. I've chosen to keep the discs in the box and just keep one or two seasons out at a time until I've gone through all of them. Also, sadly, there isn't an episode guide to be found inside, but lists of the episodes in each season can be found online and printed off, folded up, and stuck inside the box along with the discs. The paper sleeves can scratch some of the discs in transit, but many players these days can handle DVD's with a few light scratches, or even sometimes not-so-light ones. One disc, which had zero scratches whatsoever, skipped badly in my player and couldn't even be backed up onto the computer. I e-mailed Mill Creek and they sent me a replacement right away, despite their claim that they typically don't replace discs not purchased directly from their website, so if any of your discs don't work, it's worth a shot to e-mail them at the support e-mail givem at millcreekdirect.com

Despite packaging woes and the woes one might have from having up to 9 episodes crammed onto a single DVD (which usually only results in around 3.5 hours of video not sourced from film or HD video, meaning compression isn't a major problem as the quality is never going to be pristine anyway) and occasional built-in glitches or varying quality of episodes, you can't go wrong with this set. Don't buy it for more than around $35, as the packaging isn't worth more than that, but this set can be occasionally found on here for $25-$30. (It was $25.99 when I purchased it.) It's been well worth every penny to have all of my favorite Roseanne moments (sadly minus the two Beckys sketch) at my fingertips. Definitely recommended.",1391040000,45,4120,4.563513513513514

Unlike so many other reviewers, I don't have any problem with the packaging. It's difficult to package 27 disks together and individual sleeves keeps each disk protected. They just stack inside of a secure section of the container that clips them down.

My package came sealed and contained all 27 discs, NONE MISSING. It seems they have corrected this problem from other reviews. I high recommend this series to anyone who grew up in the 80s and 90s.

Rosy makes horrible meals and you know she can really cook.  all n all it is great fun and makes a nice part of my grand collection that I am building.

Yes, all of the DVDs are in a single paper sleeve, Yes, the DVDs are not ""held in"" the greatest --- but you get what you pay for.  I actually like the packaging...it is easy to find the DVD that you need because they are all a different color depending on the season, they are all labeled disc 1 - disc 2 - disc 3, and all of the discs are labeled by season.  Come on people, what else do you need.  Sorry this was not wrapped in gold packaging with unicorns and rainbows inside.  I definitely recommend this collection.

The discs are indeed stacked loose inside the box, but they fit tight enough into it that it is easy to keep them organized. Who cares if they don't come in fancy packaging, if you can pay $27.00 for all seasons of Roseanne and of this quality!

I am not missing any discs, and they all play just fine; more than just fine, they look great, considering they were recorded long before the flat screen phenomenon. The episodes are not letter-boxed, but the big square picture fills my flat screen top to bottom, with no stretching or distortion of any kind. The black bands on either side are barely noticeable when the picture is this good. The color is great, and the episodes are absolutely complete, including all of the bits of business that they included before and after the opening and closing credits.

This show is the perfect portrayal of a dysfunctional, yet happy, family. I could go on forever about what I love about Roseanne, but I'm sure since you're here reading this, then you're a fan as well.

When I buy TV shows on DVD, what I like to have is a list of episodes and which discs they are on. I started to buy each individual season of Roseanne but at times they were hard to find. So voila! Here is the complete series! Without hesitation, I bought this and thought it was a steal for the price! Well I soon learned what the price meant: horrible packaging and no episode guide. That may sound picky, but that's what I expect!

I don't have any major complaints with the set itself, I mean I don't like the paper sleeves, or how they are held in place but its not the worst possible idea im sure.  Its a shelf space saver though with this 2 in casing unit.  The quality of the show is pretty good concidering the idea of better quality was around much when the show was filmed.  A few episodes I have come across (in season 6 right now) have some issues with the clarity and all over visual representation but a couple don't take away from the whole package so its worthy of living with.  the audio is very clear, represented in digital 2.0 surround.

This has to be, far and away, one of the funniest, most honest, and reflective sitcoms ever on television. It never quite received the attention it deserved (Best Comedy series Emmy), and that continues today with this horrible packaging. As everyone has stated, the discs are in sleeves and piled on top of each other inside the box. You have to pull out a dozen discs to get to the one you want sometimes. The box has a slipcover, but its very flimsy and cheap. Regardless, you can occasionally find this on here for $25 or so, and it's worth every penny. I can't imagine there is anyone left in America that has not seen this show, butt if you haven't, drop everything and buy this. You won't regret it.",1383091200,,812,4.493243243243243

3225940,4,B000WSVBG2,"I know that a lot of people have a problem with the discs being in paper covers and being in on huge stack but those problems are easily solved.  I purchased a 10 pack of dvd cases that each hold 4 discs.  I then scanned the back and front of the series covers and printed up 6 of each.  I then trimmed the front and back covers from the series package and used it for the seventh DVD case.  After making label strips for the back of each DVD case, that say ""ROSEANNE"" and are numbered from 1 to 7, I inserted one of each into each dvd case. I placed 4 dvds in each case and used a sharpie to number them from 1 to 27.  That way I can keep track of what ones I have already watched.
  If you do not have a scanner or printer, you can simply cut strips for the labels and write the name and number on them by hand.  Again, you may want to use a sharpie and number the discs from 1 to 27.
  These disc also have the ""Play All"" feature that some discs that I have purchased elsewhere do not have; and I love that.  For the money, this series is an awesome deal even if you also purchase the 4-disc, dvd cases on Amazon.

I had sent them a photo of the junk and a statement from the P.O. saying the package had been received in bad condition, but that wasn't good enough to get my money back.

No, it's not bundled in an exact replica of the Conner's couch nor does it come with a replica of their afghan, but for this price it cannot be beat!  It's also got a bunch of extras like the original discs had.  I wish more series would have this budget-minded option available.  My Six Feet Under set is beautiful and comes with a headstone on top.  It doesn't make the show any better that I paid almost $200 for it.  I paid around $30 for 9 seasons of Roseanne and I am fine with it.  What I do is take the discs out season byt season.  So i have the three discs for season 5 out now and will open up the box and take the 3 for 6 out next.  Works fine for me.  I would recommend going through the whole set when you first get it though to make sure all the discs are there.

3225973,2,B000WSVBG2,I have loved this show since I was a kid. I was happy to see that the complete series was being released at such a reasonable price. I was however VERY disappointed at how it is packaged. This is by far the worst packaging of any DVD box set I have ever seen. You get a plastic case with 27 a stack of individual paper envelopes which contains a DVD. If you were to Drop this when the case is open you are going to have a mess. I some times borrow DVD's to my friends but this is one set I will never borrow out for a fear I will lose one of the DVD's. If your planning on buying this set I would suggest buying some other DVD cases.,1377129600,4,633,3.8396946564885495

3225976,5,B000WSVBG2,"I love this show so it was a surprise to find it so cheap for all of the seasons.  Yes, the packaging is not easy to skim through, but it stores the dvds well and doesn't take up a lot of space like some of the other shows I have in boxed sets (Friends and Sex and the City). I'm still in the first season to make sure all of them work but only if I have a problem will I change my review.",1376524800,,389,3.630952380952381

I would probably have paid a bit more money to buy the seasons individually had I known what poor quality this casing would be.  It arrived cracked (my fault for not returning to Amazon) but the cheap plastic sleeves that the discs are in are so flimsy and bound by cheap super glue style adhesive.  Definitely a disappointing and shameful packaging.,1376265600,,455,4.592592592592593

I pre ordered it and true to their word, Amazon lowered the price, not once but twice before it actually shipped. It 1st listed at around $65.00. Then, while waiting for the release date, it went down to $48.00. then, just before shipping, it dropped to just over $32.00.

3225984,4,B000WSVBG2,"Great show, cheap packaging. I'd rather have the show digitally than on disc so as not to have to fumble with discs, and this packaging doesn't make that easy, but this is a fraction of the price of the digital versions, and if, like me, you're re-watching the show in sequence, dealing with the discs is not a big deal. If you want to hunt for a specific episode, then it'll be more of a chore. I posted some pictures of the packaging that show it better than I will be able to describe it, but it's basically 27 discs in paper sleeves stacked inside a 3-deep DVD box.

The picture quality of a few of the episodes of season one were pretty woeful, but so far the rest have been as expected from a non-remastered DVD. I'm happy enough. From what I've read, the episodes are supposed to be uncut. I honestly haven't noticed much footage that I haven't seen before. The special features are entertaining and insightful.

A word of warning: if you're going to stick this on a shelf or watch it over six months, check all the discs first to make sure you're not missing any.

Bottom line, it was just too much of a steal (twenty-eight bucks) to turn down. The cheap price trumps the packaging. I'd bite their hand off if I could pick up Seinfeld at this price, paper sleeves and all.",1375920000,102,1280,4.347280334728033

Since season 9 is included in the set, I don't have to pay separately for a bad season. Packaging is cheap, of course. People can't expect to buy this 9 season series for under $45 and still get high quality packaging. You get what you pay for. The disc and episode quality is good, which is all that matters.",1373155200,70,454,4.112359550561798
3225994,4,B000WSVBG2,"I am a HUGE Roseanne fan. I had previously purchased seasons 5-9 in their original, individual season sets in 2006-2007. They had the most re-watch value of any DVDs I owned - I watched each season at least six times a year. I even watched them in my hospital room while I was in labour! However, after so much use my original discs are skipping, glitching and some of my favourite episodes are now completely unwatchable. So I was very excited to see the complete set was coming out for such a reasonable price, the cost of what I paid for a single season for nine whole seasons! My set arrived yesterday and, unlike some other reviewers here, I did receive all of the correct discs (I made sure to check after reading reviews!). But I agree, the packaging is pathetic - paper sleeves with no flip-through mechanism for easy viewing. I ditched the case and the flimsy paper sleeves at once and slipped all 27 discs inside a CD wallet so I could easily look through them. It's a pretty cheap fix, so I can't dock many stars for one of my favourite shows of all time. I highly recommend coming up with your own storage solution for this set, because looking for a next disc during a late-night Roseanne marathon does require a simpler option than taking 27 paper sleeves out individually.",1373068800,4,1287,4.504273504273504
3225995,5,B000WSVBG2,"I read some of these reviews and some concerned me wether or not the actual disks were burnt themselves because of the fact that they come in black paper sleeves. but they indeed are not! All 9 seasons are in there! The box came sealed and new. I haven't tested them out yet but there appear to be no scratches on any of them! The packaging: it does come in a collectors box and yes all the DVDs are in black paper sleeves, they are stacked accordingly to the seasons . I don't find this to be a problem for me at all. I'm willing to deal with that and pay the $30 rather than pay over $200 just to have them all in separate DVD cases. This was seriously a major steal!",1372636800,22,669,4.037593984962406
3225996,5,B000WSVBG2,"I always like Roseanne growing up but now as an adult, in a relationship, and a home owner I appreciate the humor even more! I imagine if I have kids one day my appreciation will grow further. The way the family members interact reminds me of my family, friends and our upbringing. The packaging on this set is simple which I like and some of the discs have commentary by Roseanne reflecting on the episode about to be played which is kinda cool. I'm happy with my purchase.",1372550400,,474,4.3977272727272725
3225997,4,B000WSVBG2,"I have just recently became a fair fan of Roseanne. I was too young to watch the original shows, and I didn't like the early reruns. I don't know what it is, but here lately I've found the series hilarious and addicting.

When I saw the complete series box set for a moderate price, I just knew I had to order it. I was pleased with the outer layer of the set, the pictures were great. What I don't like is how the DVDs are stored. When you open the case the DVDs are there on the right side, all 27 of them stacked in one prong. The only thing that doesn't make me too mad is that the DVDs are in little black sleeves where they want get damaged. Other recent complete series box sets have the DVDs in one or two prongs without any protection: examples being Charlie's Angles, Married... with Children, Dawson's Creek, and The King of Queens.

If the DVDs had to be stacked this way, they could've at least made the prong a little bit deeper where you wouldn't have to struggle to put the DVDs in them. Now it would've been better if the DVDs where each in their own flip case, one DVD on each side, only 14 flips. These companies are so cheap nowadays. They finally give us the complete series of our favorite shows, but they're packaged pitifully. But we learn to deal with it if we want these shows.",1372550400,2,1303,4.228915662650603

It's fun watching the kids grow up before our eyes as each season came along, and each has a great future in show biz they can enjoy now and I get to see how they have developed into stars themselves. Roseanne and Dan Conner (John Goodman) were always such an ideal couple. Who else could live with her all those years?

3226002,3,B000WSVBG2,"The series was/is terrific and ages surprisingly well. But if you're in the market for the entire series you probably know that already. Don't expect much from the extras provided herein. Rosanne's commentaries seem to have been recorded at gunpoint or after heavy sedation. I'm not sure it would be possible for her to show more contempt for the process that made her career.
The packaging consists of individual paper and plastic sleeves for the discs. That's fine, but all they do is stack all the discs on top of each other in what amounts to a single tray (box). Keeping the series in any kind of order is redundant. I'm all for getting more shows for less, but this packaging wouldn't have passed muster in Engineering 101 at even the lamest JC. Maybe Rosanne had a hand in it's design as it shows as much respect for the purchaser as she does for the viewer.",1372204800,,865,4.551282051282051
3226003,4,B000WSVBG2,"I had read a review complaining about the packaging - and where I will not be that STRONG about it, I will say - I wish it were done better. Each disc is in a paper disc cover - the way they are, it makes it hard to close the case completely unless things are in there perfect.

everything else about this is great - the price had come down which made my final decision to get the series collection - I love roseanne....lots of similarities to the family I grew up in.",1372118400,2,468,4.032258064516129
3226004,3,B000WSVBG2,"I too, like many others on here have waited for a very long time to have the complete series available in one reasonably priced nice box set.  However, this box set is horribly put together. You really do get what you pay for here.  When it finally arrived, I went right to Season 9 because it had been a long time since I had last seen those episodes...a few days later, I went to watch Season 8 and found that I was missing Season 8, Disc 1, Episodes 1-9 and had instead received two Season 8, Disc 2 dvds.  The missing disc contains some of the BEST episodes: ""the old Becky"" (Lecy) returns; Baby Jerry Garcia is born; DJ has his controversial Thanksgiving Day pageant; and Blues Traveler is in an episode.  As a huge Roseanne fan this is, in my opinion, the worst disc that could be missing from the box set!!

All in all, if you want all episodes in  one package for a low price and do not mind that the package is completely inconvenient to flip through, go for it.  Just make sure to check that you actually do have all episodes in that package AS SOON AS YOU GET IT because you only have a limited return/exchange period!!!

REPLACEMENT BOX-SET ARRIVED:  After viewing Season 8, Disc 1 (and finally paying attention to it), I just noticed something strange on my replacement.  In Season 08, Episode 05 after Roseanne's hallucination at the hospital where she saw Jerry in the monitor's screen this disc plays a DIFFERENT song than I've ever heard before.  On TV and other dvd copies, I have ONLY EVER heard the Grateful Dead's ""Not Fade Away"" being played while people dance around Roseanne in her hospital bed AND in the ending sequence where Roseanne's family picture is shown...however, this disc is playing what I believe to be Jerry Garcia's version of ""Brothers & Sisters"".

Now...about that package...here's what I've done. My ""M*A*S*H"" collection (and everyone knows how bad that packaging is) resides in a smaller ""two up"" zip binder and holds the entire collection of discs. Sits right on my shelf on top of my other TV DVDs, with the booklet inside. Every season...every DVD easily accessible. No muss, no fuss.

I will do this with the Roseanne set.",1370736000,,415,4.914285714285715

The problem is that I just received my set (yay!) and received two Season 4 Disc 3s and no Season 5 Disc 1.  Luckily, I own the fifth season already so I will just swap my S5D1 out to complete the set.  Other than that I have no complaints with this item!  I bought it when it was marked down to $28 and think the value is outstanding!  Roseanne is such a great series, one of my favorites!",1369353600,2,568,4.165137614678899

If you love Roseanne it's worth $45 to get the entire series, just know that you'll hate the packaging. The DVDs are in cheap paper sleeves, stacked on top of each other. So if you want watch season 8, you can't flip through pages like normal series DVD collections. Instead you need to take out all the sleeves to find which one you want. I've added a picture to illustrate this nonsense. Since the packaging IS part of the product, I've given it 3 stars. The series itself is definitely a 5.",1369180800,70,621,4.456140350877193
3226015,4,B000WSVBG2,"This product price started at $48, moved to $28 where I purchased, and is now up to $50. I recommend patience. Roseanne episodes are the best kind of ephemera, passing like a warm summer breeze.

Having completed viewing the entire series, I must say that it would be better with about 80% less child exposure. The kids are just not funny. The catty relationship between the girls is annoying and DJ doesn't get a joke until season 9. They ended up giving the most air time to the most irritating child, Darlene. The characterization became confused. The scholarly Becky ends up in a trailer park and slacker Darlene goes to college. Thankfully the girls brought in more interesting boy friends.",1369180800,,695,4.791666666666667

I never watched many episodes of Roseanne when it was on tv. maybe 12 episodes I saw here and there in the 9 years run. so many people talk about how good the show was. what I saw myself I thought it was good too and it was part of my life growing up as an adult. now I can look back and think oh, I lived here when that season was out, or I did this. just great feelings.",1369094400,,564,3.7083333333333335

There aren't any dividers or anything else that makes viewing the DVDs simple.  The only option is to go through the entire stack  Additionally, the shipping package was so thin that the corner of the DVD case was cracked and broken.  I would buy this again for myself but definitely not as a gift.",1368921600,117,645,4.254098360655738

I almost did it again today but decided to check Amazon one more time just for the heck of it. I was stunned to finally see this complete series available for pre order.  Glad I held out. The reruns on TV will hold me over. I can hear the theme song saxophone notes as I type. Can you?.....Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da.....Da Da Da Da....,1367280000,2,491,4.061855670103093

3226031,5,B000WSVBG2,"yes sometimes the show can be a little over the top but so can alot of families.  anyones who ever watched the last episode of roseanne would know that the show is even in roseannes (the character not roseanne barr) eyes is ""semi fiction"". (though totall fiction in reality of course)  in the show she was a writer and she was writing her memoirs but changing it up to the way she thinks it would have been better.  darlene was with mark and becky was with david for instance.
they at times one time in particular (""its people like you that give white trash a bad name"" when she took david away from that retched healey woman)admitted to being white trash.  me i think they were just real.  i think alot of people who were so against the show didn't watch the show from beginning to end the way i did.  i watched ever show ever aired and not as reruns.  i grew up watching it.  it was my favorite show since i was a child.  though they weren't sophisticated or perfect (in short they were real) it was a show that had alot of wise cracks, alot of real life situations (covering drugs, underage drinking, coming of age issues, death, domestic abuse and just about everything else) and alot of love.  i think if you look in the cracks youll see a show about a husband and a wife trying the see the humor in issues that life has brought to them.  dan whos a great husband and father with an unconditional love for his children. roseanne a mom who never seemed to forget why she loved her husband and does what she can to balance being a working mom and raising three (in the end 4, 5 if you count david) kids. becky who can be defiant and stubborn like any teenage girl.  darlene who is proof of the apple from the tree theory.  when she is affected she makes a joke out of it but when it hits the fan she recognises it and is there.  i personally think darlene was a good kid.  dj who really came together in the later seasons.  that kid cared alot about his folks in his pre teen years where most kids only care about themselves.  it just mainly came to light when the situations were serious. (dan having a close call at darlenes wedding, roseanne having complications in pregnancy, jackie getting beat). jackie the annoying sister who screws up by talkin too much. she cares tho.  beverly the insane mother whos mistakes in life she never owed up to. david and mark 2 abused boys who wind up marrying the conner girls.
what alot of people see is ""married with children""!
i love the shows.  especially ""radio days"" and ""bridge over troubled sonny"". (being a factory worker myself the first season holds a little somethin special to me what can i say.)",1234051200,,2651,4.3516260162601625

The series is about a lower class family, living in Lanford, Illinois, struggling through that odd thing we call life. The show has an intrinsic cast and they are a hard bunch not to like. Roseanne looks at some of the most common daily situations from the home and the work place. In most cases these situations turn out to be funny.
