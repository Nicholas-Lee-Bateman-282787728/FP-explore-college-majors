2307021,4,B0009OL8ZI,"Back in the day i was almost ready to lay down the hundreds of dollars required to buy the complete video sets of Degrassi so I would have them because I thought they were such quality shows.  Now I do have the complete Junior High set, and I'm quite happy with it but I really want to complete the collection with

Degrassi High.  Is there any way to make that happen???",1145664000,3,371,4.197183098591549
2307022,5,B0009OL8ZI,"I grew up watching this show and I loved it back then. It's just as good now, with the added benefit of being hugely nostalgic!",1140739200,3,127,4.12
2307023,5,B0009OL8ZI,"According to the official Degrassi website, there were 3 Seasons of Degrassi Junior High & 2 Seasons of Degrassi High.  We may have our own thinking of how the seasons went, but that's how the Producers made it.

As a teen growing up in the 80's in the US, I watched Degrassi all the time on PBS and followed the gang since i was in the same grades as they were.  I followed all the way through the end.  They may seem old and a bit odd now, but the topics are totatlly relevant to teens anytime.  I grew up also in the 90210 area, and as much as i loved that show as well, Degrassi really focused on topics that teens would deal with, popularity, siblings, suicide, etc.

A must see for parents and kids!  They don't spare anything or make it look cute and it's not always solved at the end of each episode.",1129680000,21,808,4.141025641025641
2307024,4,B0009OL8ZI,"In response to the previous review, I wanted to point out that this box set contains the entire Degrassi Junior High series.  There were only 3 seasons.  The next season is when the show switched over to the ""Degrassi High"" title.  So the next season is techinically season 1 of Degrassi High, not season 4 of Degrassi Junior High.  Anyway, this series is great and full of nostalgia for all of us 80's kids.  The only reason I give the discs 4 stars is because the quality of the dvd transfers is not very good.  There is a lot of digital compression/artifacting that can be seen in the image.  But this is not bad enough to keep you from enjoying watching these shows again.",1127347200,42,676,4.403225806451613
2307025,5,B0009OL8ZI,I grew up on Degrassi and this was the perfect addition to my collection. I love how some of the people still play in Degrassi today. Great show.,1379462400,,145,4.214285714285714
2307026,5,B0009OL8ZI,"I have still in my 20's fevered with and was pleased with the kids of Degrassi Junior High! It is very realistic with their problems and joys of youth! Specially Pat Mastroianni as Joey Jeremajah was and is always a pleasure for me to see! He really has Comedy talent and is totally refreshing for me!
Highly recommended for the kids of today! It is very entertaining, humorous and one accompanied the kids through their junior high years! I am very pleased to see that now in English every now and then!",1370908800,2,504,4.489130434782608
2307027,5,B0009OL8ZI,"I got this for my brothers GF at Christmas time -per her request.
She sent me a text a week ago saying she sat on the couch all day watching it and that she absolutely loved it!  She had a great day off with her gang from the original Degrassi Jr. High ;)",1358380800,,255,3.811320754716981
2307028,5,B0009OL8ZI,I decided to let loose and treat myself to things I have been wanting for Christmas and so glad I did!!!,1356566400,,104,4.0
2307029,5,B0009OL8ZI,This is a wonderful set for anyone who grew up watching the Degrassi Series on PBS or anyone who has never seen it before. The Set contained the complete seasons with all the episode. DVD worked very well and were organized nicely. Wonderful programming with lessons that never get old. Loved this show and this DVD collection. I have nothing but goods things to say about the quality of the DVD set!,1354579200,2,400,4.569444444444445
2307030,5,B0009OL8ZI,"This is a great DVD great picture and sound, just as described brand new will recommend to anyone. Great purchase",1353715200,,113,4.7
2307031,5,B0009OL8ZI,"Amateur acting, horrible clothes, occasionally clunky dialogue and preachy subject matter: so why do I love Degrassi Junior High so much?  I just received this DVD set as a gift, after having wanted it for many years.  I remember watching this show on public TV back in the day, and in spite of the things I said at the beginning of this paragraph, the characters are so endearing and the depiction of life in junior high is so true that it's easy to overlook the parts that don't quite work.

The young actors who portray the students were all close in age to the characters they played, and they clearly weren't culled from modeling agencies.  Most are very ordinary-looking, some are overweight, many have glasses and/or braces and some need braces.  They look and sound like real kids, and there's a sweetness and a sincerity about them that makes even the most annoying (yes, I'm talking about Joey) of them appealing.

Some of the actors playing the parents aren't very good, but they're not in the show that much, so it's not much of an issue.  The teachers Miss Avery and Mr. Raditch aren't bad.

The subject matter covers the expected range for junior high age kids: cheating for grades, trying to make friends, budding sexuality, dating, bullies, dealing with parents' issues.  I found it interesting that 12-year-olds in this show are interested in dating and sex - I wasn't quite that advanced when I was 12, but I'm sure others were.  In any case, it's always fun to see how the issues are resolved.

I highly recommend this show if you've never seen it.  The messages conveyed through the episodes are still relevant.

Note: the video transfer process on this program isn't very good.  It tends to make everyone look sort of squished.  You get used to it.  I've noticed this is a problem on a lot of programs from the 70s and 80s.",1337126400,,1844,4.627692307692308
2307032,5,B0009OL8ZI,I spent weeks watching all of the episodes to the junior high and high school seasons! This series is pure junior high. It makes u think back to when you were that age. I loved it because I love the New Degrassi seasons...so it let's you know what happened prior to the New Generation. The parents and teachers of Degrassi Jr High discussed some of the old issues that happened when they were younger on the nxt generation and now that I have seen them...I know what they are talkin about!,1307836800,,489,4.384615384615385
2307033,2,B0009OL8ZI,Ordered this in September and noted that October that the package was supposedly received by the post office but I never received the package.  I have seen the show on public tv and it was great compared to the current crop of shows (90210 / One Tree Hill / Gossip Girl).  Great show.  I recommend it.,1286582400,,301,4.339285714285714
2307034,5,B0009OL8ZI,This is definitely the most hilarious show ever! Im not sure if it was intended to be that way... Priceless!!!,1228953600,,110,4.55
2307035,5,B0009OL8ZI,"Degrassi Jr High was a big hit in the 80s and with a good reason! Everything looks and feel very real! For fans of the series i can only say ""you MUST have it""! For new ones ""you MUST see it""! Trust me youll love it and keep asking for more!",1214438400,5,241,3.7450980392156863
2307036,5,B0009OL8ZI,"So I was at the library checking out random crap when I came upon this fine little series. Initially, I thought it would just be some sort of Saved by the Bell precursor, bad acting sappy pre-teen minor life issues everything works out in the end drama/comedy. Yes, there is some of that, but overall this show is insanely believable and endearing. Holy crap, I feel like a moron admitting it but, ""I just can't stop watching this show."" Seriously, the plot lines are addictive, the characters are real and each have progressive and interesting stories. I just had to give a quick shout out for what I feel is an odd and quirky, enjoyable piece of television. You will want more.",1208131200,5,679,4.573770491803279
2307037,5,B0009OL8ZI,"The marvellous thing about ""Degrassi"" is that it is a teen series in which teenagers actually act like teenagers and are actually played by teenagers, not actors who are fast approaching 30. Sure, the scripts are corny and the actors aren't always photogenic, but that's what real life is like, right?

This box set contains the three seasons of ""Degrassi Jr High"" (which were immediately followed by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Degrassi-High-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B000R5OFPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Degrassi High - The Complete Collection</a>). The show deals with a number of major issues including sex, pregnancy, anorexia and the other standard issues that you have come to expect in teen-oriented material, but it also deals with a number of minor issues that are probably easier for most teenagers to identify with: exams, school dances, rock and roll and part time jobs. It is, infact, the storylines involving these minor issues that I found to be the more enjoyable.

""Degrassi"" was a landmark TV series when it was first aired and is still enjoyable to watch, even if its sometimes in a so-bad-its-funny kind of way.",1199750400,5,1181,5.704545454545454
2307038,5,B0009OL8ZI,Love this show!!!  I used to watch this on PBS as a kid after school when i was in junior high.  The days of Degrassi and after school specials are long gone but at least I can relive some of the memories on DVD.  One of the best Amazon purchases I've ever made.,1199145600,4,262,3.9056603773584904
2307039,5,B0009OL8ZI,"I agree with everyone else. Degrassi jnr. high had such an honesty about it. After rewatching it I fell in love with all the characters again, shortcomings and all. So we end with the school burning down and I know everyone goes off to highschool...sooo...whats with the delay in releasing Degrassi HIGH. Does anyone know when it will be released in the states? I remember it being equally satisfying...and if you need that 80's fix, just pop in a disc!",1176940800,2,453,4.675
2307040,5,B0009OL8ZI,"Bought this as a present for my wife, who absolutely loves Degrassi.  We really enjoy it!",1176422400,,89,4.5625
2307041,5,B0009OL8ZI,"I just wanted to warn those that live in the US about purchasing Degrassi High DVDs from Australia.  Even though it has released over there note that it probably won't play in the US.  DVDs when released are assigned ""region codes"" and Degrassi High is not released yet in the US so a DVD bought from Australia will most likely not play on a US DVD machine.  Buyer beware!",1165968000,3,372,4.36231884057971
2307042,5,B0009OL8ZI,"I'm in my early 20's, so I didn't really watch Degrassi Junior High when it was on. But my boyfriend, whom prior to this DVD being released would go on and on about how much he loved the show, exposed me to this show. At first I laughed and said ""Why do you like this cheesy kid stuff?"". Honestly, alot of the acting and settings are hoakey...but then there's honest human drama that we can all relate to, and you get the sensation of peeking into a real school.

The show was very grass rootsy and you can tell by the quality. But I believe that is what adds to the charm and why so many people relate to it. This show was a trailblazer and I'm happy that Canada produced this gem. I really like this show and I can't wait for Degrassi High to come out. I need to find out what happens to these kids!",1148601600,12,801,4.069620253164557
2307043,5,B0009OL8ZI,"I looked into it after hearing kevin smith rave about it on so many different occasions, I had never really given much thought to buying it ,as it is 90 bucks on amazon, but then I found the dvd collection in a half price book, movie and record store for 50 bucks. so, I picked it up and I was thoroughly engrossed in the many different stories. if you havn't seen it by now then you probablly won't ,ever, but you should it is really great .",1147478400,14,442,4.091954022988506
2307044,5,B0009OL8ZI,"I can't wait for them to release the Degrassi High series on DVD either, and they're certainly taking their sweet time doing it, too!  Let's go, already!

The Junior High Series is timeless, and I've seen some Degrassi High on VHS and they just get better and better.

I can't find any information on a release date for Degrassi High (DVD), so I hope they plan on doing it.  If they bothered to release Degrassi Junior High, then I would hope they'd continue to do so.  Somebody please post anything they know about this so that the Degrassi Fans can have something to look forward to!",1145750400,8,585,4.481132075471698

8064270,5,B0009OL8ZI,This is a very good show. All the chachators are good and my favorite is one that unfortunateally didn't that long and that was Arthurs sister Stephanie. Ironicly when I first saw theese they showed them at school in the auditorium and at the time I thought they were movies. It wasn't until later that I found out it was a tv show and I remember to this day being shocked to hear that it was. Unfortunatelly after I stopped going to that school I didn't see this show again until I got this a few years ago and its still good. You should get it.,1392422400,,546,4.160377358490566
