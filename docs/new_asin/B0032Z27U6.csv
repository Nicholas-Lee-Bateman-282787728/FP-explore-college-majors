8387701,4,B0032Z27U6,"This is a fascinating, sad, but intimate and satisfying documentary. What a pity that Kelty stopped photographing the circus so early in his life. But what he documented and what survives is priceless.  This documentary will be of interest to fans of the circus, of sideshows, and of course, of the history of photography alike. Kelty lit huge rooms with multiple flash powder lights and captured large groups of people on massive view cameras which deliver amazing clarity and require considerable skill. I was unaware of his work when I stumbled upon this film and took a chance. I'm glad that I did.",1405987200,,602,4.844660194174757
