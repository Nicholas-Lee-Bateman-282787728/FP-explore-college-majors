Movies like the obvious (Schindler's List), or the more obscure like (Harold and Maude).  This is a video later released on MTV and VH1 as a music video of an abstract but awesome musical artist named Kenna.  Mark Osborne's video is done in a claymation forum and tells the story of a creature (man like) that has a fire in his belly and becomes drawn into the mundane life that we all become enveloped in from age 20 something on.  He dreams of breaking the mold of the ""day in and day out"" grind.  He accomplishes that task and soars to greatness only to discover that happieness has to be found where you are regardless of your lot in life.  The video is transfixing. I have watched it on my 65"" HD wide screen with the Klipsch surround sound in the dark privacy of my living room many a night.  It sparks something in you.  It is what videos were supposed to do.  It tells a wonderful tale in a few minutes and leaves you in awe.  If you have an apprieciation for this art medium.....videos or movies......buy this video.",1055635200,,1117,4.352657004830918
