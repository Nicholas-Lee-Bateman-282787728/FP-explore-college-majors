Don't get me wrong though there is much more to the  film than sex. The story is stolen from ""The Witches of Eastwick""  the three witches are now free beautiful oriental girls one of whom is  oriental babe Amy Yip who fall for a man who is really an evil demon - the  whole production is very charming and colourful with some great hire wire  fight scenes and splendid sets and costumes that are visually pleasing.  There's loads of sex too but it's largely inoffensive - sometimes it seems  theres a little too much screen time given to the sexual antics of the  ladies but who's complaining! All in all this a great fun little gem of a  film and is highly recommeded to anyone who enjoys cult/camp cinema.",960854400,19,877,4.39751552795031
1233804,5,B00000JLTJ,"This film is a fantasy/martial arts epic, not a softcore porno film. The closest American equivalent would be ""Big Trouble in Little China,"" which pales in comparison to this gem. The fight scenes and  special effects are convincing and spectacular, featuring fireballs, flying  swordsmen, and a giant tongue monster.
Apparently, some people bought  this DVD based solely on the box art and title.

7912414,4,B00000JLTJ,"The first word of the title is exactly what this movie is, it is erotic by any standard, but I am surprised this was even shown in China, they have some strict rules about nudity and sex. While there is nothing graphic in the movie, there is a lot of nudity and some soft-core scenes. As far as the Ghost there isn't one, I think the Chinese name for the movie probably didn't translate well. There are 3 women who have kept up their spiritual practices for years and are on the verge of becoming what they desire, one day one of them meets a scholar who is being chased by thieves and she uses her Kung Fu on them. She sort of falls in love with him and offers to help support him. Later, the other  2 women meet this man and he has a strange effect on them, thus creating a love rectangle. It is only later that they discover who he truly is, and then we discover who they truly are. There is a Kung Fu (not martial arts) battle at the end. (someday I will find a proper translation of the title)",1444867200,,998,4.091836734693878

7912417,5,B00000JLTJ,this is an erotic sci fi film staring voluptuous amy yip and being a amy yip fan I enjoyed this film and like most chinese sci fi it envolves a demon takeing advantage of young virginy women. so their lots of sex scenes and nudity also a pretty good story line if you like chinese sci fi. worth buying for your collection.,1322438400,,322,4.209677419354839

If you are ever thinking of buying this DVD, my advice to you is :""Don't even bother !"". It is not worth the money spent and the actresses and actors are all so ""wooden"". Apart from showing off some Asian girls and their well toned bodies, the story-line is bordering on the most ridiculous and the ending is so abrupt. And where is Amy Yip as advertised in the product description ? In the DVD, there is a ""Diana"" but no Amy Yip and her infamous assets. What a big let down !",1286668800,,658,5.524752475247524
7912419,4,B00000JLTJ,"Erotic Ghost Story (the first film) is a thoroughly enjoyable romp featuring Chinese ghosts (wonderful creatures that can one moment be a whirlwind, then the next moment a voluptuous seductive vixen, then a savage wolf, then a zombie-like skeleton), with zany comedy, over-the -top ""special effects"", tons of nudity and simulated sex scenes.

Not that is pornographic - far from it.  It is not even ""soft-porn"", or at least not in the usual sense.  Having said that, the imaginative nature of the sex scenes somehow manage to be both titillating and comedic at the same time!

I disagree that it is a re-make of the Witches of Eastwick - the latter couldn't even touch this in terms of comedy and / or imagination.

This first film is far and away the best, the others (Erotic Ghost Story 2 and 3) are very poor imitations hoping to cash in on the success of the first.

My only complaint with this one is that I only own it on video tape.

I ordered the DVD from Amazon, and about 4 months later (after several notified extensions in the expected delivery date) I was told it was unavailable (Feb 2006) and I was not charged.  But I am still looking forward to the time it becomes available again.

If you like Chinese films, Chinese comedy, nudity, or zany sex, you won't be disappointed.  If you like all of these then this is the film for you.",1142640000,2,1347,4.506172839506172
7912420,1,B00000JLTJ,"Just take my words. I watched all four ""Erotic Ghost Stories"". I could live with the other three. But this one was terrible.",1123804800,2,124,4.434782608695652
7912421,2,B00000JLTJ,"To be honest, I didn't buy this movie expecting a great script or terrific acting or dazzling special effects; I was hoping to see a nice softcore movie with some cute oriental girls. In a way that's exactly what I got, so if you have similar liking you should buy this tape you will get what you're looking for, if you are looking for something else don't you will be disappointed...
To be more precise:
- The script : it wasn't exactly as bad as I expected; to sum it up it's the story of 3 celestial bunnies escaping heaven an roaming the earth in the form of beautiful ladies tempting mortal men. The dialogue is very basic and so is the intrigue making the story funny at best but also kind of stupid...
- Special effects: They are the worst ! I could do better with my own video camera and this is probably the worst thing about this video
- The girls : Of the 4 girls in the movie, you get to see two of them naked on numerous occasions they are both beautiful & exotic  and they are the main reason you should want to see this movie.
Overall : Erotic Ghost Story - Perfect Match is an interesting soft-erotic movie which should interest anyone who is looking for something a little bit more exotic than what the american market as to offer. The beautiful ladies, the oriental music and the weirdly funny story definetly set the mood...",1008720000,,1343,4.329365079365079
