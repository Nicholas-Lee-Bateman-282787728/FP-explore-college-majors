'Five Numbers' will bring yet another great link to game players on a DS game called '9 9 9' in story wise. It's a mystery that'll get your brain twisting to find the truth.",1368921600,,410,4.2025316455696204

8473795,5,B005HWAOAC,"Five Numbers! and Coicent are entertaining films well worth watching, Coicent- follows the story of a boy named Shinichi as he and his friends visit a futuristic version of Nara. While on the trip Shinichi bag is stolen by a white deer and in his pursuit he ends up going for a ride resulting in the rescue of a girl named Toto, who falls off of a building in the hopes of escaping her prison. As the two begin to get to know one another they go on a journey to explore Nara while also trying to elude Madame President and her two hired goons.

Five Numbers!-takes place in an isolated prison where five prisoners, each assigned a number but their real names are never given, awaken to find that they are the only ones remaining. The group then attempts to uncover why the prison was abandoned and just where exactly they are before they run out of time.

Both of this films has great English dubs,
If you enjoy films like Summer Wars or just don't have the time to watch an entire anime series this may be one double feature worth picking up. Buy it now!!!",1321833600,7,1057,4.333333333333333
