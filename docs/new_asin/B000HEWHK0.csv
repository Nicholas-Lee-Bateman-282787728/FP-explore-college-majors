8219596,3,B000HEWHK0,"Unfortunately, I could not get through the entire movie, despite the enticing scenes and French language.

I admittedly do not know the personal history of Cezanne and Elim Zola, but if the film is accurate they seem to have had a petulant relationship, at least for the better part of their adult lives.

And that would be fine, if the reasons for the petulance were entirely explained, which they are not. In part they seem to have evolved from the love of both for the same woman. Perhaps there was more to it as well, including the tendency (here, anyway) of Cezanne to have been extremely self-centered and a chronic complainer, never happy with anything.

The film, as another review accurately notes, begins Medan 1888, with Zola at home and expectant of the soon-to-arrive Cezanne, after an enmity that has lasted two years.

But things were not always like that. In Aix en Provence  in 1852, the boys were then in 6th grade and became inseparable, Zola, an Italian immigrant, and the son of a wealthy businessman, and Cezanne, a poor local boy.

In 1850 the young men are again in Paris, the one as a struggling and starving writer, the other as a struggling and starving artist.

And again, if this film is to be believed, the great artist and great writer were close friends for much of their lives.

But the sourness that has overtaken their relationship by the time this film begins dominates the story line and infects the text. It is not explained sufficiently to make it worth the wade.

The scenery is indeed lovely and there are some interactions that recreate the vistas in Cezanne's paintings (and those of other well-known impressionists as well).

But as a viewer, I was not sufficiency intrigued by either of those delights to continue to listen to the morose, angry and largely pointless conversations between the two greats.

Cezanne's temper tantrums appear unreasonable, and without cause, and Zola's petulance with his friend equally puzzling.

So I just gave up and turned it off.",1518307200,,2009,4.808139534883721

8219598,5,B000HEWHK0,"Now I understand the bad reviews regarding this film. In order to understand the true meaning of it and appreciate it, one needs to have some knowledge about the context, i.e. read L'Oeuvre and understand Zola's style of writing (compared the to the generation of writers that came before him, such as Victor Hugo), have some knowledge about the impressionists as a group and how they started and the revolution they did in the world of art, have read about the Dreyfus affair... I think that my reading of ""the private lives of impressionists"" by Sue Roe also gave me a totally different insight into the movie. Very good movie.",1517184000,3,629,4.7272727272727275

8219601,4,B000HEWHK0,"Unless you know a little history of the two, you may be confused. Certainly one view of Cezanne, but not the only one. Great artist, but from what I understand from reading about him this presents a much less hectic, sane view of his life. All in all a good movie.

8219603,3,B000HEWHK0,"""Cezanne et Moi"" (2016 release from France; 116 min.) brings the story of the ups and downs in the long friendship between French writer Emile Zola and the French painter Paul Cezanne. As the movie opens, we are in ""Medan 1888"", where Zola is awaiting the arrival of Cezanne, after not having seen each other for 2 years. We then go back in time to ""Aix en Provence 1852"", as we get to watch how they meet each other in 6th grade and become inseparable friends, Before we know it, we are in ""Paris 1960"" where the two are struggling to make it. At this point we're 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from veteran writer and (later in life also) director Dani&egrave;le Thompson, who is now in her mid-seventies, if you can believe it. Here, she brings us the story that on its face could be fascinating: how 2 legends from the 19th century interacted with each other over decades. Is this a true story? I have no idea, and the movie does not open with the usual ""Based on a true story"" or ""Inspired by true events"". But that is not the problem. The problem is in the script writing, which is way to heavy and wooden, resulting in us the viewers watching acting performances that simple do not convince us or get us emotionally connected or invested in any way, shape or form. When at one point Cezanne gets mad/upset at Zola, it feels fake and very much ""acted"". In that sense, certain stretches of the movie feel like watching a theater play, rather than a movie. On the plus side, the scenes that play out in the south of France (Aix) are pure eye candy and provide a much needed boost to the film. Also noteworthy (for me anyway) is the excellent original movie score, courtesy of French composer &Eacute;ric Neveux. But bottom line is that for me this movie feels like a missed opportunity, considering the potential involving large personalities of not just Cezanne and Zola, but other contemporary eventual celebrities appearing in the movie (Auguste Renoir, Guy de Maupassant, Eduart Manet, and more).

""Cezanne et Moi"" opened this past weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Tuesday evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay for a week night (about 10 people). Given the lack of critical acclaim or general positive buzz, I can't see this playing in theaters very long, so if this movie sounds like it could be of interest to you, you're more likely to check it out on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",1496188800,2,2628,4.565677966101695
