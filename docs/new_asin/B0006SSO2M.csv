2193789,5,B0006SSO2M,"It was great to see these old Lidsville episodes again - it brought back so many memories of my childhood in the 70's... (and it also proves to everyone that this unique show really *did* exist...! :-).

My kids love the show (5 & 7), and often beg to watch another of the 17 episodes included in this set.  It's a great show about people working together to solve problems, and accepting a wide range of diversity with all the different ""hat personalities""...

Hoo-Doo is a ""perfectly evil"" character, and sometimes I feel a bit uncomfortable laughing at his blatant pleasure at being evil, and I cringe at the harsh language to his cronies, the ""bad hats"" (I guess it's a kinder gentler kids' TV world these days...  no one is ""stupid"" any more... :).

Butch Patrick is a good role model, and of course ""Weenie the Genie"" is fantastic (though it still freaks me out whenever they call her ""him""... :-).  (In fact, I think I heard Charles Nelson-Reilly slip up once and call him/her a her/him...! :-)

I highly recommend this set to anyone who watched the show, and for anyone who wants to expand the imagination and creativity of their kids.  Go ""Ra Ra""!  :-D",1127260800,6,1161,4.543269230769231
2193790,5,B0006SSO2M,"These episodes are the funniest ever by the Sid and Marty Krofft group, almost singlehandedly by the evil magician Hoodoo, played by Charles Nelson Reilly. Also Raunchy Rabbit (move back flunkie). I used to crack up watching Match Game from Reilly's comments but never knew why. He is hilarious without even trying. Lidsville is a bland silly show that is perfect to watch when your either staying ay home sick, or if your under the influence. ""I could just scream.""",1125964800,9,466,4.8375
2193791,4,B0006SSO2M,"My handsome fiancee introduced me to the oddball world of Sid and Marty Krofft just a few years ago, and for my last birthday he had gotten me the box set of ""HR Pufnstuf."" No doubt I will enjoy watching that for years to come, but out of all the nostalgic Krofft shows created, ""Lidsville"" is the one I love the most. This kooky program debuted on Saturday morning television way back in 1972, visually becoming a predecessor for the off-the-wall jokes and puppetry of ""Pee Wee's Playhouse."" However, unlike ""HR Pufnstuf"" and ""The Bugaloos,"" ""Lidsville"" was specifically intended to entertain an older audience. I must warn all Moms and Dads that some of the imagery and dialogue in the 17 episodes may be a little too disturbing for small children.
Ex-Munsters child star Butch Patrick plays Mark, an ordinary all-American teenager who becomes mesmerized by a magic show performed at a Six Flags amusement park. Determined to uncover the secrets behind Merlo's sleight-of-hand illusions, he sneaks into a dressing room and accidentally falls through a gigantic top hat. Bewildered beyond his wildest imagination, he gets stranded in the heart of Lidsville, a strange and psychedelic town populated by talking hats. With the help of a clumsy but loveable Genie named Weenie (played by Pufnstuf's Billie Hayes), Mark is forced to dodge the clutches of Horatio J. Hoodoo (Charles Nelson Reily), a powerful and diabolical green-faced magician who is clearly the star in the cast. Time and time again, Hoodoo uses his most wicked tactics to imprision Mark in his dungeon, enslave Weenie, and force Lidville's Good Hat people to pay their taxes. Prepare to be shocked and amazed upon witnessing The Great Hoodoo's tricks, which range from Devil worship (Weenie, Weenie, Where's Our Genie?) to giant robots (Show Me the Way to Go Home) to making obedient servants via a homemade brainwashing machine (The Great Brain Robbery). Horatio even attempts to conjure up snow, ice, and lightning from a Weather Bureau (World in a Hat) and forms a zap happy relationship with a cackling Wichipoo (Have I Got a Girl for Hoodoo!). On many other occasions, he has to rely on a team of bumbling goons to do his dirty work: a dimwitted stuffed rabbit named Raunchy and four Bad Hats (a sneaky Gangster, a bloodsucking Vampire, a sword-weilding Pirate, and a demented Executioner who waves a sharp hatchet). In my opinion, what truly makes ""Lidsville"" a cult favorite among college grads and acid trippers is how it juxtaposes hyperactive variety show humor with bizarre scenery, ultra-cheesy special effects (including a large injection of Chroma Key), and an entire cast of heavily costumed midgets. Indeed, the episodes have the potential of becoming the perfect fodder for drinking games and Rocky Horror-style shouting matches. And let's not forget how Hoodoo's character inspired the early incarnation of shock rocker Marilyn Manson, who borrowed some of the pilot episode's audio footage for the Spooky Kids song ""Dope Hat.""
So, why am I giving the box set just four stars? Well, there are a few reasons. While most of the dialogue is both awful and laughable, the musical numbers are unbearably kitchy. Despite being written by Les Szarvas (who composed alot of songs for Sid and Marty Krofft over the years), the cute melodies are just not as memorable as the ones sung by Jack Wild and Billie Hayes on ""Pufnstuf."" Also, some of the aforementioned program's props were recycled as part of ""Lidsville's"" low-budget production. Keep an eye out for the talking books and grinning skull in Hoodoo's laboratory and the twisted walking trees in the Hair Forest (I think that I shall never see a tree that is as hairy as me!). But what bothered me the most about the episodes is how they seem completely mixed up thanks to  their broadcast. If you wish to bring some order to the colorful chaos (particularly with the plotlines and the characters' actions), I recommend you watch the DVDs in the following title sequence:

1. World in a Hat
2. Turn in Your Turban...You're Through!
3. Weenie, Weenie, Where's Our Genie?
4. Take Me to Your Rabbit
5. Show Me the Way to Go Home
6. Let's Hear it for Whizzo
7. A Little Hoodoo Goes a Long Way
8. Oh, Brother!
9. Hoodoo, Who?
10. Alias, the Imperial Wizard
11. Fly Now, Vacuum Later!
12. The Great Brain Robbery
13. The Old Hat Home
14. Is There a Mayor in the House?
15. Have I Got a Girl for Hoodoo!
16. Mommy Hoodoo
17. Mark and the Beanstalk

Seriously, if you are a disenchanted horror, sci-fi, or cartoon lover who longs for something completely different, please give ""Lidsville"" a try. I can guarantee that it's downright WEIRD!!",1120780800,50,4664,4.8641509433962264
2193792,4,B0006SSO2M,"This show freaked me out as a kid and it's still a bit creepy as an adult. But who can resist the charms of Charles Nelson Riley? Hopefully someday Uncle Croc will come out on DVD.

Contrary to what some people have been saying the Krofft show on DVD are not syndicated version.  While primetime shows were 25 minutes in the 70s, Krofft shows were made for Saturday mornings. They were shorter in order to pack in more ads and extra educational shorts. How else did School House Rock fit into a show? Check out the times on H-B's Wacky Races to see what a Saturday morning show runs at.

The image on Lidsville isn't as good as Pufnstuff since the living hats were shot on video.",1120694400,15,679,4.330708661417323
2193793,5,B0006SSO2M,"You've got to hand it to those Krofft brothers Sid and Marty. They came up with some of the wackiest and strangest Saturday morning shows imaginable in the early 1970s. The brothers are responsible for bringing us Land of the Lost, Sigmund and the Sea Monsters, and H. R. Pufnstuf. They also brought us Lidsville. As much as I loved it, the show freaked me out.

In case you don't remember, the premise of the show was kind of convoluted. Mark (played by Butch Patrick, a.k.a. Eddie Munster) goes to see Merlino the Magician perform. After the show, Mark goes backstage to nose around and in doing so discovers Merlino's hat. He touches the hat, and it begins to grow and grow. Soon, it pretty much takes up the whole room. Unable to resist, Mark climbs up to have a look and falls inside. And that's how he ends up in Lidsville, which is a land filled with living hats (yes, really). Hat people. Whichever of the Krofft brothers came up with this concept must have been on some serious drugs.

Anyway, the series of 17 episodes (which ran from 1971-1973), focuses on lots of strange goings-on, and lots of attempts by Mark to find his way home. His efforts are thwarted by Hoo Doo the Magician (played by the very flamboyant Charles Nelson Reilly. Hoo Doo, who isn't himself a hat, and his evil band of bad hats cause trouble whenever they can. Hoo Doo is especially pissed off at Mark because Mark absconded with the magician's magic ring, which gives the owner power to order and control Weenie the Genie. Weenie is a questionable name for a male genie, especially one played by a woman playing a male genie. Very weird indeed.

But there's a band of good hats too, and they're Mark's friends. And Mark is cool since he can control Weenie the Genie.

If you want to turn off your mind and relive Saturday mornings the way they used to be, you can't go wrong with this great DVD set. Introduce it to your kids so they can flip their lids too.",1113264000,8,1944,4.452247191011236
2193794,5,B0006SSO2M,"I remember it from the 70's growing up, and it was great to get to see them again.  When it comes to Sid and Marty Krofft, it looks like the fans (us kids of the 70's) grew up and are still fans, watching their shows.  Look at who buys these in the store, they are parents who grew up with these shows and want their kids to as well.  We watch it first, then the kids get to see it.",1109980800,7,382,3.75
2193795,2,B0006SSO2M,"This is a great show for kids.  I grew up with it and have fond memories of it.  However, the shows appear not to have been remastered in the slightest.  Picture quality is not close to the original.  Moreover, it appears that edited versions of the show which were cut for syndication were used on this set -- each show runs about 22 minutes, even though the typical 1/2 hour TV show from the early 70s ran about 25 minutes.  It's a shame that such a great show is getting such poor treatment from Rhino.",1106956800,11,505,4.273684210526316
2193823,5,B0006SSO2M,"""Lidsville"" is my favorite of Sid and Marty Krofft's classic, live-action Saturday morning shows from the early 1970's. And it is one trippy tale. Fascinated after watching a magic act, Mark (""The Munsters'"" Butch Patrick) falls down a giant magician's hat and lands in loopy Lidsville, inhabited by talking hats! Mark is befriended by the Good Hats, including British Col. Poom, Miss Ring-A-Ding (a party hat), Nursy, the chinese Mr. Chow, Tonsolini (an Opera Singing Hat), Mother Wheels (a motorcycle/helmet), Rah-Rah (a football helmet), etc. and Weenie (Billie Hayes), a rather inept but kind-hearted Genie. The versatile Hayes, best known as Witchiepoo on ""H.R. Pufnstuff"", comments that she was offered the role of Weenie The Genie (a male role) after Billy Barty became ill, although Barty denied that the role was created specifically for him. There are also the Bad Hats, who are the flunkies of the evil magician Horatio Hoo-Doo (Charles Nelson Reilly). Hoo-Doo is furious at the Good Hats for not acknowledging him as their Lord and Master, and not paying him taxes. He also hates ""that brat Mark"" for  continually helping the Good Hats plan revolts  against him. He flies in the skies over Lidsville in his Hattermerand, zapping the Good Hats. But, no matter how nasty Hoo-Doo is, he is continually out-witted by Mark, Weenie The Genie, and the Good Hats. Director Tony Charmoli presides over the fantasy/insanity. The episodes usually end with a moral, a song or two (by Les Szvaris and Charles Fox), and Hoo-Doo exclaiming, ""I want my Mommy Hoo-Doo!""  The rather horrible Mommy Hoo-Doo, who fears her son Horatio is not ""rotten"" enough, does appear in the final episode.
  The Good Hats were, probably, supposed to be the original focus, but there is no question that Charles Nelson Reilly is the star of the show. Reilly, with his larger-than-life performance persona, is deliriously, delightfully over the top (hat pun intended) as Hoo-Doo. Sid Krofft remarks in a commentary that Reilly had more energy than anybody else at the ABC televison network. The best episode, ""Have I Got A Girl For Hoo-Doo"", is actually a semi-cross-over with ""H.R. Pufnstuff."" A lovelorn Hoo-Doo writes a letter to a lonely hearts club seeking a girlfriend-- and gets Witchiepoo (Billie Hayes plays both Witchiepoo and Weenie The Genie in this episode). Their initial mutual dislike (Hoo-Doo: You're about as sexy as a plucked vulture."" Witchiepoo: ""You're too ugly to be good-looking"") disappears when they discover they enjoy zapping together  and causing chaos for the Good Hats. The Good Hats soon realize they must break up this terrible twosome, so Mark cross-dresses as Lovey-Dovey, a Mae West type female! ""I hope I don't catch it from Women's Lib,"" Mark says afterwards. Billie Hayes and Butch Patrick offer a great, giggly commentary on this episode.
  Everything about ""Lidsville"" is extraordinary; particularly when you consider that the 17 episodes were filmed over an 11 week period. The show itself had a four year network run, on both ABC and NBC. The work hours must have been long and arduous. Charles Nelson Reilly always complained about how hot and  miserable he was in Hoo-Doo's make-up and costume. Conditions must have been doubly hot and miserable for Sharon Baird, Joy Campbell, Jerry Maren, Angelo Rositto, Van Snowden, Felix Silla, Buddy Douglas and the Hermine Midgets; the actors inside the Good and Bad Hat costumes. The Good and Bad Hat characters are also superbly voiced by Lennie Weinrib, Joan Gerber, and Walker Edmiston. Sid and Marty Kroft had an extraordinary influence on the generation that grew up watching their shows. Look inside the oversized magician's hat that Hoo-Doo and his flunkies live in and you'll see where Paul Rebuns got his ideas for ""Pee-Wee's Playhouse"", more than a decade later.
  The three DVD ""Lidsville"" set is loaded with extras; including interviews and selected episode commentary from Sid and Marty Krofft, Butch Patrick, Billie Hayes, and  the, sadly, late Charles Nelson Reilly; and excerpts from Butch Patrick's personal scrapbook. Watching ""Lidsville"" again, after more than twenty years had passed, I frequently thought to myself, ""Who the hell thought THIS up?""  The extraordinary Krofft brand of creativity and imagination has completely vanished from television today; which perhaps increases appreciation and affection for ""Lidsville."" Butch Patrick admits he was too young (at ages 17 and 18) to appreciate ""Lidsville"" at the time, but he seems fond of it now. Even the constantly complaining Charles Nelson Reilly admitted in an audio commentary that ""Lidsville"" is clever, colorful, and inventive. ""Lidsville,"" like the Kroffts' other shows, should never be discounted as merely a ""children's show."" Between the visual imagery and verbal puns and humor that go way over children's heads, there is an abundance of adult appeal.

2193825,5,B0006SSO2M,"Lidsville is a little-known treasure from the early 1970s! The title song has stuck with me for over 36 years and I still LOVE it! This is a little, wacky show with the talents of Billie Hayes (Witchiepoo), Butch Patrick(Eddie Munster) and the ever-flambouyant, late Charles Nelson Reilly. A teenager named Mark (Butch Patrick), sneaks back into an area where a magician was performing his show at an amusement park. Mark falls into the magician's hat. When he hits bottom, he is in the zany land of Lidsville, surrounded by the good ""Hat People"". These ""Hat People"", in the shapes of a helmet, chef's hat, safari hat, party hat,  etc., befriend him and join forces against HooDoo, the mad magician who lives in the ""Top Hat"" on the hill with his bumbling henchmen. HooDoo flies his real top hat that converts into a ""Hattamaran""! HooDoo constantly abuses/over-taxes the good Hat People and foils Mark's (Butch Patrick) attepts to get back into his own world. Aided by HooDoo's bumbling former Genie, ""Weenie the Genie"" (Billie Hayes), who lives in a ring on Mark's finger, Mark makes attempts at getting skyward on a magic carpet and even in HooDoo's Hattamaran! There is plenty of word-play for adult enjoyment (the ""Weather Bureau"" is a chest of drawers-- a bureau-- whose drawers HooDoo can ""zap"" and create select weather conditions). I always sang the song to my children as they grew and, one fateful day in an electronics store, I found Lidsville! I bought it, brough it home and my kids love it, too! Silly, now, but they still love it. Mostly, Mom loves this silly little show that brings back wonderful memories of a 10 year old eager for Saturday mornings and the wonderful Lidsville to air! I only lament that the show lasted only one season. Okay, the set was wobbly and soooo obviously fake, but folks, this is a must-have for you and the youngsters in your life. I have two: one for myself to keep and one for my kids (since the 'bad' thing could happen to the disc).

Mark (Butch Patrick aka Eddie Munster)watches a magician at a show. He goes back stage and is sucked into the magician top hat. He enter a bizzarre world of talking hats and its overlord Hoo Doo (Charles Nelsen Relly). He is aided in his survival by Genie (Billy Haynes AKA Witchy-Poo from PuffnStuff)

There are a few commentary from the Krofft Brothers, Butch Patrick and Billy Hayes on some episodes. also there is interviews with all three leads. Too Bad Charles Nelson Relly didn't do a commentary

this complete series, These 17 episodes,  are well done for 1970's kid fare. The DVD masters are cleaner than most 1970's stuff (see my Lancelot Link Secret Chimp review). So if you are a fan of the Krofft Stuff or 1970 SATURDAY MORNING FARE, Go get it, it worth it..if you aren't, don't !

Lidsville was among the better ones. Like most children at the time, this absolutely freaked me out in 1971 when I was 7, the sight of Butch Patrick falling down the magic hat and the strange creatures that flashed on the screen a'la a male version of Alice in Wonderland. I agree that Charles Nelson Reily as Hoodoo MADE this show with his wild, wisecracking sense of humor and the episode where he falls in love with Witchiepoo (from Pufnstuf) is quite a hoot! This kind of true creativity and wit  put LIDSVILLE above the sickening corn and mush of the other Sid and Marty Kroft weirdouts of the time, and along with the BUGALOOS, this is one of the few that I would sit and watch a moment of today.",1131148800,3,1033,4.4603174603174605

Mark (played by Butch Patrick) {The Munsters}  goes to see a magic show and is entranced by the magical hat. He sneaks backstage after the show and gets curious enough to snatch the hat from the table only for it to grow into a King Kong size hat. Still curious he climbs up on the brim, looses his balance and falls into Lidsville which is full of living hats

While in Lidsville trying to find a way home, Mark has to deal with the evil magician Hoo Doo and his crew of baddies Mr Big, Captain Hook nose, Executioner, and Vampire as well as Jack and Raunchy Rabbit played by Sharon Baird. Hoo Doo is also after Mark, because Mark stole his magic ring which controls Weenie Hoo Doo's former Genie played by the wonderful Billie Hayes

My favorite episodes are Have I Got A Girl For Hoo Doo with Witchiepoo, I am a huge fan of HR Pufnstuf as well [see my review on Pufnstuf]

8042699,4,B0006SSO2M,"Sid and Marty Krofft made some spectacularly bizarre kid's shows for Saturday mornings in the 1970's, but of all their (many) efforts in my book ""Lidsville"" is the weirdest. It stars Butch Patrick (""The Munsters"") as a teenager mesmerized by a magician at a Texas amusement park who falls into the clutches of the evil Hoodoo (Charles Nelson Reilly, in possibly his most over the top role) after falling into a gigantic top hat in his dressing room. After falling he winds up in Lidsville, the land of hats, where he is befriended by the world's worst genie, Weenie, played by the great character actress Billie Hayes (Witchiepoo, etc.)

After convincing the confused hats that he is friendly, mayhem and hilarity ensue for all 17 episodes (my personal favorite being ""Fly Now, Vacuum Later."") The psychedelica is very heavy, but the ultra-low production values prevent this from being scary to all but the youngest of children (Hoodoo's flying hat is a favorite ""scary"" feature of mine.) The cast works well together and it's obviously intended to be campy. The plots of most episodes are extremely similar, so don't expect much new other than details between the episodes, but that was (and is) typical of episodic children's television. Besides Hoodoo's flying hat, other recurring disjointed elements I found amusing include an incredibly dimwitted rabbit henchman forever fouling up Hoodoo's plans, and a band in desperate need of material that intermittently pops up for a few seconds to sing a couple of lines summarizing the latest plotpoints for kids having a hard time keeping up with all the weirdness.

""Lidsville"" is an iconic piece of the Saturday morning television landscape from the 1970s, and as such I recommend it to anyone who has a strange soft spot for Krofft productions, and especially for those people who remember it from the childhood who now have kids of their own who need a little bit of hat-induced drama (trauma?) in their lives.

Lidsville was Sid and Marty Krofft's third television show following H.R. Pufnstuf (1969) and The Bugaloos (1970). As did its predecessors, the series combined two types of characters: conventional actors in makeup filmed alongside performers in full mascot costumes, whose voices were dubbed in post-production. The show starred Butch ""The Munsters"" Patrick as the boy who falls thru a top hat into Lidsville, Weenie the Genie played by Billie ""WitchiePoo"" Hayes, and Horatio J. HooDoo played by Charles Nelson Reilly who flies around the town in his Hatamaran scaring the good hats of the town.
