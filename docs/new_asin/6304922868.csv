941029,5,6304922868,"I was lucky to see this fantastic movie at the Fox Theater in the 1950's. I was in the 3rd grade and remember this film...several of my buddies and I couldn't wait to see this film.  In those days you only new about a new  movie a week or two before it came to your theater.
We were so scared,  the military looked so up to date, and they were helpless.  The movie was  set to modern times, so we felt like we could be attacked next.  Made for  many many sleepless nights.  a young boys delight!",932256000,22,495,4.030927835051546
941030,4,6304922868,"On the surface this 1954 movie appears to pretty bare-bones in comparison to other 1950s sci-fi epics. Richard Denning (Frank) and Kathleen Crowley (Nora), along with two others, are holed-up in a deserted hotel in a large American city (probably Chicago). The city's inhabitants have been evacuated, but these four have been overlooked. The menacing Venusian robot force (actually one robot), while a bit clunky and one dimensional, presents a threatening, underlying presence throughout the movie. When will it strike with its death-ray? Can anyone survive its monomaniac pursuit?

The movie's director, Sherman Rose, deftly explores the theme of loneliness and isolation among the crew's cast. Nora's failed suicide attempt and Frank's stoic acceptance of his being ""rolled outside a bar after flashing a big roll"" the night before seem to create a credible chemistry that bonds the characters' fates together. If misery loves company, Frank and Nora want no part of the company that waits outside the flimsy boundaries of their hotel room.

Black and white movies occasionally intensify austerity in a way that color films do not. The seeming hopelessness of Frank and Nora's situation, the desertion of the city, and unblinking, unnerving robot presence raise the emotional level of ""Target Earth"" up a couple of notches.

Viewers will like movie's ending too. The ""science"" portion of ""Target Earth"" gets the viewer to a strong visual climax as military scientists race against time to develop an ultrasonic sound wave generator that will defeat the invading menace. Will they get to Frank and Nora in time? Or will the lurking robot(s) find them first?

Kudos must also go to supporting actors Virginia Grey (Vicky) and Richard Reeves (Jim) as a pair of Pol Roger champagne guzzling reprobates who vow to drink their way from one end of the city to the other. As down-and-outers in their own isolated existence, their being trapped with Frank and Nora aptly points out that they have something more to live for than imbibing and gambling on the ""daily double.""

The acting is first rate and the story's plot comes from a nice short story called ""The Deadly City"" by Paul Fairman.",925776000,155,2186,5.094972067039106

941247,3,6304922868,"What would you do if you woke up one morning and discovered no electricity, no water, no people?  This movie begins with that premise.  The opening sequence is appropriately eerie but then it doesnt take full advantage of it before gathering a few stragglers for what ends up a claustrophobic standoff in a hotel room (a pared down version of The Desperate Hours).  Meanwhile, the military struggles with how to kill the invaders (a robot that looks like a child made it out of cardboard boxes).  These two storylines are irritatingly divided in such a manner that it feels as if someone is channel hopping between a gritty urban thriller and a nonsensical sci-fi flick.  Neither segments work to their fullest.",1361059200,3,711,4.8429752066115705

941254,3,6304922868,"In TARGET EARTH, director Sherman Rose presents an effective thriller that combines a creepy atmosphere of an uncertain menace with a resonant cry of existential loneliness.  The first half is a powerful indictment of how people erect walls of solitude around themselves.  A recent widower (Kathleen Crowley) awakens in a hotel room after what we later learn is a suicide attempt brought on by guilt over her causing a car accident that killed her husband.  At the same time, Frank (Richard Denning) has been mugged and wanders the city in a daze.  Both realize that the city has been evacuated.  They meet and must learn to relate to each other before they can comprehend the crunching loneliness surrounding them. They meet a quarreling couple (Richard Reeves and Virginia Grey) who see their enforced solitude as an unexpected opportunity to get gloriously drunk.  None of them has any clear idea about what has happened. They barely comprehend in rational terms the events leading up to this latest event.  Until this point, TARGET EARTH works well as a study in enforced isolation, one that would later be used more than once in a future TWILIGHT ZONE episode. Then director Rose takes the film into the realm of 50s type science fiction. A newspaper headline tells them that ""invaders"" of an unknown type have attacked the city.  As they walk the city, they see robots patrolling the streets with apparent orders to blast humans on sight with death rays. The second half devolves into a standard shoot-em-up with scientists led by veteran character actor Whit Bissel as a scientist seeking a means to defeat the invaders who come from Venus.  The military interaction between robot and humanity is both predictable and vaguely reminiscent of the urban guerilla warfare that had been raging in Europe just ten years earlier. TARGET EARTH at least starts well before dissolving into a well-trod goo that even then had been a staple of the genre. Still, it is worth a view.",1243728000,,1976,4.90990990990991
941255,3,6304922868,"Based off the excellent short story, ""The Deadly City"" by Paul Fairman, arrives this interesting 50s Sci-Fier. The story is about how a group of disparate people awaken in a metropolis to discover it abandoned and that there all alone....save for some hostile enemy robots! Well directed and with decent acting, the film uses it's Black and White cinematography quite efficently to build isolation and tension. The Robots are both cheesy and imposing, if that makes any sense. This film could have been somewhat better had characterization taken a more front seat and the film didn't slip into melodramatics. The short story was highly superior in it's terror, and even if this is a low-budget, much could have been made of this. Still, not completely unworthy of re-reviewing, especially for Sci-Fi buffs.",1239321600,,806,5.113636363636363
941330,5,6304922868,"Target Earth is a low budget (very low budget!) thriller made in 1954.  This is a familiar Sci-Fi story of invaders from space, but with very little focus on the actual ""invasion."" Instead, this story is told from the vantage point of a handful of people that accidentally (at least some of them accidentally) stayed behind after their city was completely evacuated due to the impending alien attack.  They have no idea what is going on outside and what is coming and that makes for some good suspense.  People react as people will in that sutuation.  The special effects are certainly comical and the story-line is absurd, but hey, this is entertainment, right?  What I really liked was that the DVD arrived packaged like a current version DVD and the quality of the playback is top notch, like it was just filmed last week (in Black and White of course).  This movie was always a favorite of mine when I was a kid and now I have a quality copy to watch when I want.  Worth the price.",1223164800,6,985,4.5
941331,4,6304922868,This film is well acted and directed.  The only weak spot would be the robotic enemy invading the earth.  And they're not really too bad. The story demands a lot emotionally of the acting and in general the actors do a very good job of it. Not the typical Sci-Fi type film.  More reality based.

941332,2,6304922868,"I Love 50's Sci-Fi but the best thing about this is the DVD box....The Robot on the box is factors of 100 cooler than the one in the movie.  If you want to see a so-bad-it's-good movie kind of like PLAN 9 then go for this but don't buy this thinking it's some kind of Forbidden Planet or D.T.E.S.S.

I will say that the idea behind the movie is interesting but it is let down by terrible effects even for this era (taken with a grain of salt and a Martini)....this movie COULD have been really good and would make an AWESOME remake in the right hands.  I found the special features about the Director very interesting.",1204502400,3,618,4.264957264957265
941333,5,6304922868,"This movie scared the hell out of me when I was a little kid. Is there any other service for a B movie like this?

Specal footnote, producer Herman Cohen (August 27, 1925 - June 2, 2002) was a producer of B-movies during the 1950s, who helped to popularize the teen horror movie genre with films like the cult classic ""I Was a Teenage Werewolf"" (1957)...his motion picture career began at his local cinema, the Dexter Theater in Detroit, during his preteen years; he worked there as a ""gofer"" and later as an usher...his next stop was assistant manager of Detroit's Fox Theater. After a Marine Corps hitch, Cohen worked as sales manager for the Detroit branch of Columbia Pictures, then relocated to Hollywood and worked in the publicity department of Columbia there. He produced his first movies for Jack Broder's Realart Pictures in the early 1950s and made several subsequent pictures for Allied Artists and United Artists. Cohen made exploitation history in the mid-1950s when he began producing some of American International's earliest hits, among them the cult favorite ""I Was a Teenage Werewolf."" (1957) featuring unknown horror actor Michael Landon as a troubled teenager and Whit Bissell as the primary adult. It was written and produced by cult film producer Herman Cohen, it was made on a very low budget but grossed as much as US$2,000,000 per week in its early weeks of release,and was one of the most successful films released by AIP (American International Pictures)..Herman Cohen's filmography,  The Bushwhackers (1952), Kid Monk Baroni (1952), Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla (1952), Battles of Chief Pontiac (1952), River Beat (1954), Target Earth (1954), Magnificent Roughnecks (1956), Dance with Me Henry (1956), The Brass Legend (1956), Crime of Passion (1957), I Was a Teenage Werewolf (1957), I Was a Teenage Frankenstein (1957), Blood of Dracula (1957), How to Make a Monster (1958), Horrors of the Black Museum (1959), The Headless Ghost (1959), Konga (1961), Black Zoo (1963), A Study in Terror (1965), Berserk!

In 1961, he returned to his roots in Detroit purchasing the Fox Theater he had worked for in his youth. By the late 1970s, Cohen was working more in writing and distribution than in film production. He founded Cobra Media, a domestic distribution company, in 1981. Cohen died of throat cancer June 2, 2002.

941336,3,6304922868,"Forget all of the national conflicts our planet has--the Venusians have now invaded with giant robots armed with death rays.  That is the premise of this classic B movie science fiction matinee flick.  All of the baby boomers remember those low budget sci-fi flicks that all us guys went to see.  Well, this is one of the better ones, and actually features decent if not great acting, terrible special effects, but an actual storyline that I found surprisingly engaging after not seeing this flick for around 40 years.

A few people awake in a city to find it evacuated.  Each missed the evacuation for his or her special reason; one woman had tried unsuccessfully to commit suicide with sleeping pills.  They soon find that the city is menaced by huge electronic robots armed with death rays.  Earth's (propeller-driven) bombers and artillery are powerless against the Venusian invaders, who are plainly the advance guard of a full-blown invasion.

Human technology carries the day (after all, we are all still here).  No spoilers here.

As I noted above, this film, unlike some of these old science fiction matinee films, actually has a decent storyline and acceptable acting.  Kathleen Crowley, in my opinion, turns in a particularly nice performance.  Overall, this film is great fun and nostalgia, if one's expectations are not too high.

941417,4,6304922868,"This film terrified me when I first saw it at the age of 9, but I doubt it will terrify anyone who has been raised in the era of sophisticated special effects.  Nonetheless, it is a short (75 minutes), entertaining, and fun movie that captures the mood generated by the 1950s flying saucer scares.

The story centers on Nora and Frank, two strangers who've been left behind while the city was evacuated in response to an unknown (to them) threat.  The eerie opening music creates the mood as Nora wakes from the stupor of an attempted suicide via sleeping pills.  Alarmed to discover that both her rooming house and the entire city (as seen through her window) seem to be deserted, she gets dressed and goes off in search of someone.

With overhead photography worthy of Hitchcock, we follow Nora through the streets as she stumbles upon a dead body and eventually meets Frank, an out-of-town businessman who was also left behind after being mugged and knocked out the previous evening.  They join forces, and eventually meet up with a drunken, bickering couple in an abandoned nightclub.

Together the four go outside, determined to find a way out of town.  It is then that they have their first encounter with the invaders, robots from space armed with a deadly heat ray.  Here is where you have to suspend judgment about the primitive special effects, but the rest of the movie is fast-paced and suspenseful, right up to the end.",1116547200,16,1432,4.718875502008032

But TARGET EARTH screams out for a widescreen transfer from the first HORRIBLY CROPPED FRAME.  You can't even read most of the opening credits because of the sloppy transfer job.  It's inexcusable, especially when you refer back to the box and see ""Widescreen"" prominently printed on the cover.
Having said that, this was my first exposure to this taut, cheap little invasion flick, and I was fairly impressed.  The black & white photography adds much to the feeling of isolation and desperation experienced by the characters.  And the robot is pretty decent, by 50's sci-fi standards.  Heckuva climax, too.  But you'll have to see that for yourself.

No deep messages or insights into the human condition. Nope, this is sci-fi stripped down to it's basic elements. A small band of people, led by Frank (Richard Denning), have awakened to find the city of Los Angeles deserted except for themselves and a small army of killer robots from Venus. Due to financial constraints, there is only one robot. It is basically an old furnace with flexible dryer-duct legs. Sadly, the robot is only seen about 4-5 times, as it was fairly entertaining to watch while it lumbered along. The rest of the film has our not-so-merry bunch trying to stay out of the robot's way. A couple of them are hit by it's death-ray, and it does come crashing through a plate-glass window at one point. Otherwise, it's just vacant street scenes and discussions among the survivors about an invasion and devastation we never actually get to see. Of course, there's plenty of grainy old military stock footage as well. TARGET EARTH is not a bad movie, it's just not a classic. I still recommend it for diehard sci-fi maniacs...",1072828800,16,1170,4.768472906403941

After a failed suicide attempt, Nora King (Kathleen Crowley) wakes up to find the city deserted except for a body or two with horrified expressions on their faces. She encounters Richard Denning and they try to figure out what happened (he had been mugged unconcious) while they ""slept"". They meet a colorful couple drinking it up who survived also and the four band together. An invasion of robots from Venus have attacked the Earth and everyone has evacuated. (Well, actually it's only one robot clanking around but this IS a low-budget quickie). They end up in a hotel, contend with a gangster and fight the robot. Not everyone survives, but there's a rescue by the armed forces who have discovered how to demobilize the robots. With high-frequency sound! Engagingly goofy, loopy sci-fi that's competently acted but very low-budget. The robot is so cheesy looking I expected pieces of him to fall off any moment. But that was part of the fun.

941422,5,6304922868,This has always been a favorite of mine. The low budget keeps things simple but very atmospheric. This is a very good DVD! The commentary is from the Roan laserdisc from a few years ago (which I still have). The picture is fine and this IS a widescreen disc! Around 1.85 to 1. The viewers who claim that it isn't are watching another disc! This is the real McCoy.,1065916800,11,363,4.27536231884058
941423,3,6304922868,"This was one of those films I always watched and enjoyed as a kid. Its starts off with a great begining. It does slow up in the middle but the end, considering the limited budget and special effects - is still efective. The quality of this DVD is very good. The people who made this movie loved these type of films and it shows. ""Target Earth"" is worth adding to any classic Science Fiction collection.",1062633600,,402,4.373333333333333
941424,5,6304922868,"I found the audio commentary by producer Herman Cohen to be very informative as well as entertaining. It's a shame he passed away last year, it would have been great to hear him speak about his other projects. ONE COMPLAINT although listed as widescreen it is in fact full frame and even the credits are half missing from the opening titles!",1057276800,7,341,4.60655737704918
941425,3,6304922868,"I recently saw this movie, and I have to admit it was pretty fun.  Yeah, it was fairly cheap and cheesy, but a good, solid sci-fi b-movie.  The story revolves around a group of individuals who find themselves trapped in recently evacuated city.  Not knowing why the city is empty, they start looking for answers and find that the city has been taken over by an army of killer robots from space.  (Well, for budgetary reasons, there is only one robot, but they use it again and again to create the illusion of many.)  And the space robot looks pretty hokey, but whatever....did anyone else notice the sort of misogynic treatment of the women in this movie?  Maybe this was par back in 1954, I don't know, but it seemed almost comical they way the men ordered the women around, telling them to keep quiet or to shut up and such. I also thought it was funny how Mort Marshalls' character, Charles Otis, was introduced, provided some exposition, and then was efficiently eliminated.  Don't get me wrong, as his character was highly annoying, and a quick departure was welcome, but it all seemed a little to convienent.  The story moves along, and there is a side story with the army trying to find a weakness in the alien invaders, devise a method to overcome them before they have to use atomic weapons on the city.
The picture and sound are pretty good, and there are a few extras, including a sort of video homage and biography to the producer, Herman Cohen, who also made movies like I Was A Teenage Werewolf, I Was A Teenage Frankenstein, and Horrors Of The Black Museum.  There is also a commentary track by either the producer or the director, I can't remember which.",1055203200,17,1670,4.558528428093646
941426,3,6304922868,"Considering what a shoestring budget Herman Cohen's first production was made on, it's almost a masterpiece.
Sci-fi mainstay Richard Denning awakens one morning in the city, to find there's no city.  Everyone in it is gone  -  almost.  He runs into frightened Kathleen Crowley, and eventually into another couple, Virginia Grey and Richard Reeves, who aren't sure whether the world's ended or not (and aren't frankly too worried about it, if it has), and so celebrate with champagne just in case.  In time, an on-the-lam hood joins the group, making them all wonder what is worse:  invaders from beyond, or their own next door neighbors.
And what's come from beyond are alien robots  -  clunky tin-can jobs, with a single cyclopean eye that fires a killer heat-ray  -  intent, for whatever reason, on eliminating the local populace.  The military has the city cordoned off, and is busy studying the single robot they've captured.  They theorize it was sent by a humanoid race, probably from Venus, as a vanguard for invasion.
Can they find the robots' weakness, and exploit it in time?  Will the abandoned city's survivors manage to find a way to survive each other, let alone the invading metal men?
This movie succeeds despite its remarkable cheapness  -  only one robot was made, recycled to represent an army of them  -  but its script is fairly trite.  It's still worth watching, though, for the performances and the end-of-the-world fun with killer robots.",1023062400,20,1462,4.946502057613169

7879731,3,6304922868,"Story opens on a scene from the air zeroing in on L.A. and slowing down to silently show an unconscious woman (Kathleen Crowley); beside her is a half empty bottle of sleeping pills.

The story is of a hand full of people who wake up to find the city is empty of humankind that is live human kind, they must piece together the missing parts to the puzzle they must learn to cooperate with each other and huddle together.

Soon they will realize that they are at ground zero on ""Target Earth.""

The film has all the feel and dialog of an old twilight zone episode, However the actors of frontline majors. Virginia Grey was in over 140 movies and programs including ""Bachelor in Paradise"" (1961). Richard Denning was in ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" (1954).

The whole movie was made on a shoestring budget so they only had one robot (Steve Calvert the head bartender at Cerro's nightclub) that they tinkered together in a garage. The car (Oldsmobile convertible) with the dead uh...err... battery belonged to the producer (Herman Cohen.) And they used a buddy in the police forces to stop the traffic for the empty street shots. All shot in seven days, mostly in the deserted L.A. streets on a Sunday morning.

One of the most horrifying parts of this movie was that they were forced to drink warm beer.",1506643200,9,1305,4.607758620689655
