8565109,1,B001P06JMW,I can't believe that I even paid money for this horrible quality horrible horrible music in it. I couldn't even pay attention to the story because the quality and music distracted.,1453593600,,180,4.838709677419355
8565110,5,B001P06JMW,"A truly amazing story demonstrating the impact that choices we make have on the lives of ourselves and those around us, that perseverance and faith can pull us through troubled times, that sometimes circumstances of life that are out of our control in the end can make us stronger, that we should never disregard the impact of family and community.",1449964800,,348,4.816666666666666

8565112,5,B001P06JMW,This documentary tells of the poor choices and consequences of a young Philadelphia woman and the love and support of her family.  I believe this movie should be in all high schools and shown as a motivating force to help young women make better choices about their lives.,1346112000,5,272,4.666666666666667
8565113,2,B001P06JMW,"I'm doing my master's thesis on what is wrong with the death penalty system and rented this as a part of my research. While I sympathize with the story being told and in no way refute any factual part of it, this is not exactly what I would call good production values. It's very do-it-yourself with a low quality. Again, while I sympathize with the situation these people dealt with and have nothing but the utmost respect for what they went through, parts of this tell irrelevant sides to the story that have nothing to do with the woman's trial and carry on about the families tribulations outside of this situation. So it tends to lag and drag with lots of irrelevant information. It could be cut down to only about a third of the time and tell the same story and would be twice as effective. It loses the viewer's interest and focus as it is and I was expecting a more professionally made film.",1294617600,4,899,4.421686746987952
8565114,5,B001P06JMW,"I enjoyed watching Justice for her, because it shows the love of a mother. Also, the video educated on the errors of the trail. This video was about my cousin although I have never met my cousin, I was able to understand the path she walked and how she survived.",1267574400,2,262,4.26
