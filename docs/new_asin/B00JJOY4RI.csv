6361914,3,B00JJOY4RI,"Oh well, I received my copy of this DVD collection today.  Was it worth it? Kind of.
I would like to know what copy a previous reviewer was watching when he claimed Treasure of the Four Crowns was in near mint condition? Crowns is one of my faves of the cult 1980s films. The print looked liked it was taken from an old MGM VHS tape. There were flecks abound on this title. The added point is a commentary by Russell Dyball about the movie and Cult movie star, Tony Anthony which makes me forgive the not- so- great transfer to DVD.
As for the others? Devil's Island is a hoot. In the first twenty minutes, you have cat fighting inmates, a Dustin Hoffman lookalike rabble rousing the inmates, and of course Jim Brown and Christopher George who have been in worse films than this. Hey, the movie is in wide screen , too.
The Final Option  I had seen before, and was only impressed because cult, star, Ingrid Pitt played one of the terrorists. Wide screen, too
Shake Hands With the Devil is a 50s thriller with James Cagney. Though the film is full frame, the print is near perfect, you swear you were in the theater when this first played.
So, in a nutshell, a 2.5 rating. Two wide screen titles, two full frame titles, and a commentary on one of my fave cult actors, Tony Anthony. I love you, ya Stranger you. Mr. Anthony, if you are reading this, be cool.",1417132800,9,1356,4.334645669291339
6361915,4,B00JJOY4RI,"Much caricature of the Irish but a the same time an insight into their flaws and virtues. Not a bad introduction to the Irish Civil War and its brutalities. The film belongs to Cagney who captures the essence of the fierce puritanical fanatic with little mental flexibility and a hatred of women.
The film in some ways is a sop to the British as the soldiers are good and the Black and Tans bad. Still in many ways not a bad film.",1410739200,2,430,4.2560975609756095
6361916,1,B00JJOY4RI,"Imagine my excitement to see a movie from my youth for the first time on DVD. I counted the days until ""Treasure of the Four Crowns"" would see its first release date since the early days of VHS. I finally receive the movie in the mail, quickly unwrap it and toss into my DVD player. My excitement turned to extreme disappointment during the first few seconds of the movie. Do we get a widescreen, remastered print? Absolutely not! Far from it. The print that is used looks like an old full frame TV print from the 70's even thought this movie was made in the 80's. Horrible. Shout Factory usually puts out great product, but this is the number one worst release ever for this company. I'm actually shocked they would green light this print. Don't get me wrong, the movie itself is at most, Saturday morning fun, but it deserved a better fate than this. TC",1409788800,12,855,4.452229299363057
6361917,3,B00JJOY4RI,Treasure of the four Crowns is from the VHS Master. This is the one movie I wanted when I ordered this DVD but I would have passed if I knew it wasn't Widescreen. Very Very Sad!!,1406678400,9,178,3.9722222222222223
6361918,1,B00JJOY4RI,"This movie was cheesy but,I liked the idea behind the movie of a ""James bond"" type theme. I hoped for better quality video and sound, but it is very OLD. Glad someone made the time to put the movie on DVD.",1405641600,4,205,4.024390243902439
6361919,4,B00JJOY4RI,"I've been waiting for ""Treasure of the Four Crowns"" to get a proper release for years, and while it's not the best copy possible, I'm just glad to have something that I can show my friends when I try to explain what might possibly be one of the most ridiculously awesome movies of my youth. The audio commentary included is surprisingly informative, but also has some pretty strange humor in it. I couldn't always be sure if the guy doing it was completely sincere in some of his praise (almost as if his serious appraisals of the movie were meant to be a joke), but all in all it was a fun fan commentary track worthy of the film itself.

The other three films on this set are pretty decent as well, but as always with multi-film sets like this, your mileage will vary. But at this price this set is worth it for fans of movies that are a little off the beaten path. Highly recommended.",1405382400,17,887,4.311377245508982
6361920,5,B00JJOY4RI,"I am very pleased and honored to write the very first review on the dvd release of one of the greatest films of all time!! My eyes cannot believe what they are seeing!!!! This cannot be right!!! The Treasure of the Four Crowns! On DVD!! In Region I (USA and Canada) format! This can not be! How could this be? I am so very, very, very excited that this is coming true!! I saw this in a shopping mall movie theater when I was in the fourth grade!! The theater, of course is no longer!! I saw this movie in 3-D, with the paper glasses and the red and blue lenses! I have been looking for this movie FOREVER!! I have it on vhs in a pre-viewed format, but this, this copy on DVD will be outstanding! I only wish that it was coming out on its' own, with its' own packaging, in maybe a two or three disc format!! But this will do, this will do!! I'm not complaining!! I will buy multiples of this DVD I assure you!! I have so many good memories of this film, they used to even show it on Saturday afternoons on television, but with the 3-D already adjusted for broadcast, and you could literally see the strings on some of the flying objects! You gotta love it!! I LOVE it! Soon, I will be able to finally remove it from my own treasure list of DVDs. I am still looking for Electric Dreams, On The Right Track, Hamburger-The Motion Picture, Hardly Working, In The Company of Darkness, Godzilla 1985, The Earthling, The Champ, The Swarm, Blue Movie(1980's comedy), Making Contact, Pandemonium, Ruckus, Run, Bang, Surf 2, The Last Shark, L'Ultimo Squalo, Great White, The Dark Room-television series,among others!

6361924,5,B00JJOY4RI,Final Option (1 of 4 on the DVD set) is a hidden gem worthy  of 5 stars!  Great insight to the 1980s Cold War proxy Terrorism scene.  Shows some Special Air Service skills of the 1980s.  Very believable.,1488153600,,203,4.2631578947368425

6361931,5,B00JJOY4RI,I actually bought this 4 pack dvd collection to get Shake Hands With the Devil about the IRA in the early part of the 20th century in Ireland. I have ever been looking for this movie on DVD and it's hard to find. I was surprised when I found it with 3 other action movies. If your a Cagney fan jump on this. The other 3 I haven't watched yet but consider it a bonus.,1467331200,,366,3.8933333333333335

6361946,4,B00JJOY4RI,"Overall a nice collection of films but I really wanna talk about the main reason I bought this which was to get Treasure of the Four Crowns. The picture and sound  quality is good, not great, I agree it could use a remastering but this was the best print Shout Factory could find. Remember this is a cult movie that was not some huge Hollywood hit, so the fact it was even released on DVD is kind of amazing... The commentary is really quite good, and very informational for someone who is just a fan. I think if you want Treasure of the Four Crowns on DVD just buy this. Now it could maybe get cleaned up and come out on Blu Ray... But I would not hold my breath on that.....",1429401600,2,676,4.121212121212121

6361950,5,B00JJOY4RI,"Took a chance on this set. Sometimes the movies are great and others they are not or won't even play! I bought this set for,the Final Option. A great SAS movie. I have it as a region 4 but I'd like one in Region 1. Got it and it plays great! Great picture and sound. Worth every penny!",1417651200,5,285,3.9310344827586206
8651370,5,B00JJOY4RI,"I bought this because it was the only way I could find TREASURE OF THE FOUR CROWNS, a ridiculously cheesy RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK rip-off that was originally released in 3D.

8651374,3,B00JJOY4RI,"I mostly bought this for Treasure of the Four Crowns. I didn't expect the quality to be very good, and it's not; mostly just OK.
