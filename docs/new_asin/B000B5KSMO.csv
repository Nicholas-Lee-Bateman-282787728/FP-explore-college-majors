2400052,3,B000B5KSMO,"I'm not exactly sure why the Timeless Media Group released this 15 episode collection of ""The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp.""  These same 15 episodes appeared in a larger collection of 26 episodes released in 2005 by Rhino Entertainment and titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Life-and-Legend-of-Wyatt-Earp-From-Ellsworth-to-Tombstone/dp/B000B5KSMO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp - From Ellsworth to Tombstone</a>&nbsp;which Amazon also carries.  Given that the Rhino set offers 11 additional episodes and more bonus features at a slightly higher suggested retail price, I am not sure why anyone would want to purchase this set . . . . . it's simply a condensed repackaging of a better set that is still available.  Regardless, here are the episodes and single bonus feature contained in this three disc set.

Disc 1
*Wyatt Earp Becomes A Marshal
*Marshal Earp Meets General Lee
*Wyatt Earp Comes To Wichita
*Bat Masterson Again
*Dodge City Gets A New Marshal

Disc 2
*Wyatt Meets Doc Holliday
*Dodge City - Hail And Farewell
*Tombstone
*Wells Fargo Calling Marshal Earp
*The Truth About Old Man Clanton

Disc 3
*Requiem For Old Man Clanton
*Wyatt's Brothers Join Up
*Just Before The Battle
*Gunfight At The O.K. Corral
*The Outlaws Cry Murder

Extra:
Interview with star Hugh O'Brian

Bottom Line:  Good show, but it's been done before on DVD.",1186358400,42,1424,5.586046511627907
2400053,5,B000B5KSMO,"This is a great dvd set. The best part is the recent interview with Hugh O'Brien. Except for some sun damage from probably spending too much time outdoors, Hugh looks absolutely terrific. For a recently married man of 82, he looks at least 20 years younger. Hugh discusses his career, his intense preparation for the role, his experience as the youngest drill instructor in the history of the marine corp, and other bits of information. The clarity of each episode is terrific. I only hope that other golden western dvd and detective shows are also soon released while the stars of these shows are still alive. Having them appear to introduce the dvd is a great touch.",1175385600,7,668,4.717948717948718

2400056,3,B000B5KSMO,"The other reviewers have glossed over the fact that Rhino has put out a package of a limited number of episodes. But to those of us who are full ""Wyatt Earp"" fans why could we not have the same treatment as most of the other classic TV shows have received ... that is, release Season 1, then Season 2, etc all in their entirety and in episodic order. This show was broadcast from 1955 to 1961 ... Rhino has thrown us a bone instead of the seven-course meal we deserve. The quality is good ... big deal ... now many of us have to continue to sit back and wait for someone to ""do it correctly"" ... it may never happen ... but Hugh O'Brian and the gang, including us fans, deserve better.",1155513600,21,685,4.157894736842105
2400057,5,B000B5KSMO,"I was around 10 years of age when this series ran on TV, and though I'm sure I did not see every episode I know I saw many of them. I'm glad that many DVDs are now coming out for us 'ole' TV western fans.

When I grew up in the fifties, 10-cent Saturday matinees abounded; with serials running in 12 parts or so. See one or two this Saturday and come back to the local Bijou next Saturday to see a couple more installments. After a couple of these on any given Saturday the theatre would then run a couple Rocky Lane, Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, or Durango Kid feature westerns to round out your western Saturday late morning and early afternoon. It sure offered great babysitting for mom, too!

Now with the Western Channel and release of such DVDs as this one on Wyatt Earp we can get all we want, and relive 'those thrilling days of yesteryear."" And wasn't Hugh O'Brien just born to play this role; can anyone think of anyone else doing better than this man did week-after-week-after-week?

Seriously this is a very well put together production, with only a couple flaws: One being the continual singing by the Ken Darby group, it gets inappropriate at times, and the other being only a selection of the entire shows. In one program on the first disc when Wyatt goes to Wichita you can tell at the end of the program that next week will be a followup, but the DVD doesn't have the next week, it skips forward to others. These are very minor complaints because for me just to have these DVDs are more than I ever hoped for.

So load up the ole Buntline special, saddle the horses, and join Wyatt's posse to rid the range of rapscallions, western style.

Recommended.

2400058,5,B000B5KSMO,"The TV Western fan has been poorly served in DVD releases generally, although with the release of season sets for 'Have Gun Will Travel' & season 1 of 'Wanted Dead or Alive' recently and the forthcoming 'Gunsmoke' DVD companies may have perhaps realised there is a market for these old series.

I think most fans would prefer a season by season release rather than a 'best of' collection however we probably have to take what we can get.

I was surprised and delighted that Rhino have picked up on 'The Life & Legend of Wyatt Earp'an excellent example of the genre. Although this is basically a 'best of' collection some thought has obviously gone into it. Rather than random episodes they have structured it to cover Earps career from Ellswoth to Tombstone.

Disc 1 includes the very first episode and chronicles Wyatts decision to become a marshal and his subsequent move to Wichita. Discs 2 & 3 follow his moves to Dodge City & Tombstone whilst Disc 4 is composed of the last 5 episodes in the series which dealt with the build-up and gunfight at the OK Corral and its aftermath.

There are also interviews with Hugh O'Brian & Mason Dinehart(who played Bat Masterson), a timeline of Earps career and information about the executive producer as extras.

Picture quality is  very good with nice sharp prints and sound.

It is nicely packaged in a slip-case with fold out interior that has some colour photos of O'Brian in the role.

Overall this is an excellent release,congratulations to Rhino for taking some time and trouble to make it an interesting package.

If you are a TV western fan I would highly recommend you obtain this.",1129507200,98,1634,4.725352112676056
2400059,5,B000B5KSMO,"""The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp"" was significant in television history as it, ""Cheyenne,"" and ""Gunsmoke"" were among the very first of the so called ""adult Westerns"" to be broadcast on network television.  Prospective buyers of this DVD set should be aware that this 2005 release is not a season 1 release, but rather a ""best of"" collection of episodes that arrived with very little fanfare.  For some fans of the series, that might be enough to put them off but, frankly, this is a ""best of"" DVD release with a difference.  There is an attempt to present the 26 episodes in this collection in chronological order and focus on the historical events in the life of Wyatt Earp (at least as much as a weekly, non-documentary TV series allows), right up through the climactic gunfight at the O.K. Corral.  There are also present day interviews with star Hugh O'Brian and Mason Dinehart III, who played Bat Masterson in the early years of the series, plus a historical timeline about the real Wyatt Earp and other members of the Earp family.  For a series that began broadcasts in 1955, it was somewhat surprising to see this welcome bonus material included and one has to credit the independent releasing company, Rhino Home Video, with delivering one of the better vintage TV-on-DVD packages in recent memory.

As might be expected for a 50 year old television series, there are occasional film specks and grain present on the episodes, at least on the sampling of episodes that I've watched on disc 1.  But, for the most part, the episodes look fairly crisp, and the slight imperfections found shouldn't deter anyone interested in this series; it's a worthwhile release for fans of ""Wyatt Earp"" and classic TV Westerns, in general.",1127952000,119,1731,4.808080808080808
2400060,5,B000B5KSMO,The life and legend of wyatt earp was a great show and i have all episodes. I truly enjoy it. You might like to know that hugh o brian just celebrated his 90th birthday this past april 2015.,1436486400,,190,4.026315789473684

2400062,5,B000B5KSMO,"This show was one of my earliest childhood TV memories. I loved Hugh O'Brian as a child. For me, he was Wyatt Earp. Sometimes, however, I have found in later years that shows I adored in childhood really don't measure up to my adult tastes.

I am delighted to say, this is not the case with Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp.

After catching some episodes on Encore westerns, I decided to take a chance and order the show. They are a hefty price but these are the old time disk sets, meaning lots of episodes and lots of disks. They are exceedingly good quality, both picture and sound.
The best thing however, is just how darned good this show is. Earp's private life is pretty much deleted but his character is intact. Wyatt Earp was a hero in many ways but he was a man with faults. O'Brian does a marvelous job portraying the nuances of the man's character. His Earp can be arrogant, judgmental and possessing a volcanic temper. But he also has a passion for justice and refreshingly down to earth attitude regarding people.
A young Bat Masterson is the primary sidekick here but other recurring characters, namely the two Cheyenne Indians, Mr. Brother and Mr. Cousin, make their debuts in this season as well.
The first season has a number of great episodes in it, but one standout for me was The Bribe, when Wyatt has to face the unthinkable; one of his deputies is corrupt and on a killing spree. A fine, superbly tense story. It makes you wonder how they could do so much with a 30 minute show back then and so little with an hour (all right, 42 minute) show now. At any rate, the writing is very high quality. A major accomplishment, considering how many episodes are in a season.
On one disk, it does seem like the episodes are out of order, but I would agree they were probably aired that way by the network. It is a problem easily solved; I'm just putting a note in the case to remind myself to watch them in the order of the story plots, not air dates.
I really cannot recommend this show enough. Absolute quality television, well worth the price. (I bought all six seasons, being very happy to find seasons 1 and 2.)",1428278400,3,2126,4.407124681933842

I'm not really sure of his acting abilities...as a young lad I always enjoyed watching the famous adventures of Wyatt Earp. This DVD set is well done and the transfer over is flawless and in good shape!

Watch the actresses, they can't stop staring at Mr O'Brian. The character actors shine, some in multiple roles. Hey, Inception, sell us the rest!",1394841600,,461,4.566265060240964
2400083,5,B000B5KSMO,"Wow, really enjoying these. Old enough to recall watching these on TV first run. And I still find them entertaining. As played, Wyatt was sort of a goodie two shoes, but every once in awhile his darker side comes out. My only issue with the set is that the episodes are out of order. There are soft story arcs that get jumbled, but that is slight criticism indeed. And the references to things past, that you haven't seen yet, can largely be ignored without impacting the enjoyment of the episodes. Will be going after season two!",1393804800,,530,4.53125

Strange how you watch and savour westerns even if outcome so obviously apparent.

2400095,4,B000B5KSMO,"The only complaint I have of the First Season set is that, in a series that has a continuing, serial-like story, it is important that the shows be shown in proper order. The Buntline Special appears in Disc 2, before Wyatt Earp meets Ned Buntline in Disc 3 and gets the Buntline Special.  There is a revenge episode by John Wesley Hardin, a relative of Mannen Clements, before the episode with Earp besting Mannen Clements, the cause for the revenge, etc.  Otherwise, the stories are pretty good, the acting is good.  Sound and picture quality are very good.  While I think Gunsmoke, starting the same year, was a superior show, there is room for this one as well, particularly for young kids, as Gunsmoke was really a show for adults.  For future seasons, here is hoping that the manufacturer puts them out in the order of broadcast, so they make sense.",1372982400,,854,4.629139072847682

2400120,3,B000B5KSMO,"The picture quality was great, but the audio was very high, with no bass and I had the sound volume way down on my set. I was only 13 (now over 5xs that age) when this was on and of course, in B & W. Wyatt was suppose to be only in his 20's, but, Hugh seemed to be in his early 30's and with such poise and human knowledge, made his character way too unbelievable and everybody was called Mister, except of course, the horses and the women. For background music, there was a vocal group singing and humming, without instruments. Saved on paying union wages. The streets always seemed empty for being a cowboy town and with the only exception of where a runaway boy was involved; NO CHILDREN pictured; they might have been in school. The night scenes were very much as the same as the day-time scenes: bright. A very low budget show. Unless you want to have the series for a keepsake, don't buy this one; Bat Masterson, in the first couple of shows is a high pitched boy and when he returns with a mustache, in his 20's, he is still the same high pitched boy.

2400122,5,B000B5KSMO,"I totally agree with the previous reviewer (Bradford M. Smith ""smithb"") as I sure would like to see more seasons of this fine show become available soon. I paid $16.99 for this product, and what I got was 5 discs of pure pleasure viewing, and a big blast from the past. I'm an Aussie and this was one of the best Westerns I can recall watching when I was a young lad. Hugh O'Brian plays his part as Wyatt Earp extremely well, and the other actors do a pretty darn good job too!
Picture & sound quality are both 100%
All episodes are of the finest quality transfer, and I've watched every episode very closely!
Not bad for a series made in 1955!
There is only one minor flaw with this product, and it is that all five discs are on one long spindle.
The black plastic casing is very solid and does protect the discs well, and for the price one shouldn't complain.
I already had a spare 5 disc plastic casing with separate pages for each disc, which only cost me a few dollars, therefore that minor flaw for me was easily fixed.
I'm not taking any stars of this product even for that minor flaw, cause I really do want to be able to buy the remaining seasons of this extremely educational and entertaining show, as it is actually based on historical facts, hence the title ""The Life And Legend Of Wyatt Earp"".
I can fully recommend this product to anyone who loves a great Western TV Serial.
I'm sure that all who do purchase this first season by Inception Media Group will agree with 'smithb' and myself and want more seasons made as well.",1330992000,15,1537,4.340277777777778

2400126,3,B000B5KSMO,"Supposedly based on the actual life of the famous lawman and figure from the West, The Life And Legend of Wyatt Earp: The Complete First Season (1955-56), isn't an action oriented, shoot `em up type western.  Handsome Hugh O'Brien is great in the role, and although he occasionally gets a chance to demonstrate Wyatt Earp's legendary speed at drawing a gun, the instances where he actually shoots his pistol, are generally few and far between.  As a lawman, Earp does his best to uphold the law without resorting to violence, being well aware that his reputation for being extremely fast on the draw, serves to deter most from openly challenging him.  The program may be more of a thinking man's Western, as Wyatt Earp typically uses reason, psychology, and his knowledge of human nature to try and deal with potentially explosive situations, rather than a gun.  The series was apparently quite well received, as it ran for six seasons and produced a whopping 225 episodes.  The first season contains 35 episodes on 5 discs.

Hugh O'Brien plays Earp as a classy gentleman, who can get very tough when necessary.  He's extremely likeable, though perhaps too good to be true, as he seems to have few faults.  He's almost always confident and in control, although his emotions do sometimes take over.  How much truth there is in this characterization, and in the stories that are featured, is for expert historians to say.  The real Wyatt Earp usually had a handlebar moustache, which O'Brien certainly does not have (and would probably look quite ridiculous if he did).  Regularly featuring gambling, drinking, crooked schemes, crime, and murder, the program is not exactly ideal family fare, but the lack of violence and gunplay, is a change of pace from a program like The Rifleman, where you could pretty much count on Lucas McCain doing some damage with his rifle in nearly every episode.  Those expecting a little more action may be slightly disappointed, but like most westerns, the program does attempt to provide some life lessons.

The first season finds Wyatt Earp reluctantly becoming a lawman in the town of Ellsworth, Kansas after the sheriff is gunned down.  It's not long before he is hired to become the Marshall in Wichita, Kansas.  After bringing some order to the town, Earp moves on to Dodge City, Kansas (the home of Gunsmoke's Matt Dillon) to become the Marshall there in 1876.  Earp's first days in Dodge City are dramatized in the final episode of Season One.

This is the wild west, where lack of respect for the law and for any man wearing a badge, is extremely common.  Either Earp's life or his job, seem to be constantly at stake.  Earp has a temper, and is sometimes bullheaded.  He often bumps heads with the local judge, threatening to quit, or putting his job on the line by doing things his way.  Fortunately after a while, he gains the support of a loyal group of deputies to back him up, but things don't seem to go smoothly for very long.  Earp never really establishes a close relationship with any of the other semi-regular characters, and as something of a loner, his moves from town to town occur with no big goodbyes.

Wyatt's friendship with Bat Masterson is featured in some early episodes, and then resurfaces much later in the episode ""Bat Masterson Again"".  Bat believes he is in love, but is in danger of being gunned down by a man interested in the same woman.  Wyatt provides some very insightful training in the fine art of shooting, that later saves Masterson's life.  In ""The Pinkertons"", Earp has an encounter with the famous detective Allen Pinkerton, who is portrayed as arrogant and accustomed to throwing his weight around.  However in this story, Wyatt saves Pinkerton's life.  Another notable episode is the season finale, which features Earp's arrival in Dodge City, where numerous troublemakers are already gunning for the new Marshall.  The town is so violent, that Earp ends up shooting almost as many men in one day, than in his entire time in Wichita.  Surviving in Dodge, will be no easy matter for Wyatt Earp.

Image quality for the episodes in Season One is quite good for a program some 55 years old.  For whatever reasons, subsequent seasons of the program have not been released.  That's unfortunate, as with Wyatt Earp in Dodge City, the level of action is sure to increase, and he would later establish solid relationships with Bat Masterson, and Doc Holiday.",1313020800,7,4431,4.8110964332893
2400127,5,B000B5KSMO,"On Aug. 6, 2007, one reviewer questioned the point of this release of 15 shows when another similar release has 26 shows at ""a slightly higher price""  Since the 15 show release was done two years later, someone must of thought that the smaller set was a meaningful set that still tells the story and at a less expensive price.  Currently, the 26 show set NEW is at $46.31 while the 15 show set NEW is only $20.98.  I don't call the 26 show set ""slightly higher"" like the Aug. 6th reviewer does.  It is nearly 121% more expensive.  A LIKE NEW 26 show set is 171% more expensive than a 15 show set. There are 73% more shows in the 26 show set but it doesn't compare to higher prices of 121% and 171%.  Botton line----this a great set for the money!!!

Another reviewer (one of only 3 reviews before mine), gave it only one star because the box that holds the 3 DVDs says ""The Life & Legend of Wyatt Earp"" and the individual DVD cases and the indivdual discs say ""The Best of The Legend of Wyatt Earp"".  This is certainly not a valid reason to rate it one star.  I believe we should be rating the quality of the picture, audio, and story.  Certainly, what you receive in value for the cost is very important.  Therefore, this is truly a 5 Star set.",1306195200,6,1245,4.210970464135021
2400128,5,B000B5KSMO,"Although this DVD collection has been out for more than five years, it is, in my opinion, a better buy for consumers than the Wyatt Earp Season 1 set.  ASlthough Season 1 is presented in proper chronological order, the Rhino setr is superior because it attempts to place events in Earp's life in proper historical context (hence the reason for dividing the DVD episodes into ""chapters.""

Picture quality and audio is superb, although one may experience problems playing the DVD's in TV's with ""built-in"" DVD players.  I did, but since I also had a regular DVD player handy, there was no real problem.

The extra features are great, especially the interviews with Hugh O' Brian and Mason Dineheart III.  To his credit, O' Brian did a great job with portraying the Wyatt Earp character as realistically as possible given the parameters of 1950's TV westerns.  For instance:

1.  The real Earp preferred to use fists and not guns whenever possible to maintain order.
2.  The real Earp often used a shotgun when possible to maintain order.
3.  It is still unclear as to whether Wyatt himself was presented with a ""Buntline Special.""  However, since Colt did make the pistol ca. 1870's and I like to think Wyatt had one, I will not belabor the point.  When he did use a pistol in the line of duty, he used it to conk unruly cowhands over the head.

Hugh O' Brian brings these 3 characteristics of the real Wyatt alive in a masterful fashion.  I had the honor of speaking to Mr. O'Brian once for a few minutes, and he'll always be ""Wyatt Earp""

When we received the set, we watched episode after episode, viewing all of them in one weekend, because the stories were so good.  It tells how Wyatt made the decision to join law enforcement, his moves to various western towns and how he cleaned them up, ending up with the infamous fight at the OK Corral.  Seems to me he just wanted a peaceful town, not a showdown.  There are humorous moments and ""real life"" moments as well.  The viewwer learns about the guns Wyatt shot, how he met Doc Holiday and others, his brothers and their part in law enforcement.  Even the Clantons show up here and there before the final showdown.

I was really disappointed, though, when I plugged in the first disc. My DVD player, a high end LG model, begain to vibrate excessively and make a loud chattering noise as the player tried to track the information on the disc. Although I got a picture, the heavy vibration and loud noise caused me to eject the disc after less than 1 minute, for fear that it would cause my player to come apart. Thinking that maybe I had gotten just 1 bad disc, I tried the other 4, one at a time.  THEY ALL CAUSED THE SAME PROBLEM. I tries a few of my other DVDs just to make sure that thr problem wasn't in the player. It wasn't. I have watched sevral other DVDs on the same player and they all run quiet and smooth. This was definitely defective manufacturing. Too bad! I returned the set to Amazon for a refund because I was afraid that a replacement might have the same problem.

2400132,5,B000B5KSMO,"The Falcon Picture Group of Illinois is to be thanked for producing such a fine DVD transfer of The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp. The technical quality is outstanding, and the disks are one sided which some ""big"" studios should do with their old shows.

Wyatt Earp has always been a favorite of mine.  My grandfather whistled the Ken Darby Singers' title song as I was growing up.

What I remembered the most was that Wyatt Earp didn't smoke and drank milk.  My grandmother would tell us children-""Drink your milk.  Wyatt Earp does.""  What was strange to us kids was that our grandmother drank buttermilk!

The fifties and early sixties were scary times for us children.  On our black and white screens we had a window to the world, especially the world of the western heroes.

Some of the best episodes of season one are the ones with Bat Materson and Ben Thompson.  The Buntline Special and the Big Baby Contest are especially humorous with some serious moments.

If you want a family oriented series, then Wyatt Earp is a good one.  Make no mistake, Wyatt Earp was no saint in this series.  His temper got the best of him at times.  The Englishman episode shows this side of Wyatt the best.

There is violence.  It was a violent time in American history.

Deacon Earp was a role model.  Desilu Studios oversaw a number of great series in the 50's and 60's with heroes and wholesome family values which was not political talk back in those days.

Finally, the show opening credits are from a much later season, after Earp moved to Tombstone (which would make the credits shown from season five or six), not the Ellsworth and Witchita episodes.
