8541760,5,B009I4QTFO,"Should animals be kept in captivity? I own pets, therefore I support captivity and I would be hypocrite, like most Blackfish Supporter are, if I would boycott SeaWorld or other zoological facilities. They always say: ""my dog is a domesticated animal"" well, was the very first dog domesticated though? Didn't they have to capture wild animals from the wild and breed them with other types of their species? I think that we learn a lot from these animals when they are in our care.  A lot of what they learn from the animals in their care can be used to better understand animals in nature.  Yes, some of this research can happen in nature but to fully understand all the intimate details of these animals you have to spend years studying them.  Its not something that is easily done in the wild.  80% of the animals that are currently in their care were born at SeaWorld and not from the wild. Those animals, like Tilikum, that were captured in the wild have been in captivity for 30+ years. They haven't captured animals from the wild in 35 years and have no plans on capturing animals in the future.

I agree with the changes SeaWorld has been forced to make with regards to having trainers in the water with Orcas.  Trainer safety should be and is one of their top priorities.  Any animal, even our own pets, has the ability to hurt us and our children under the right circumstances.  When you're talking about an animal the size of a Killer Whale, you just cant predict how they will behave on a bad day.

With regards to concerns that these animals are living in tanks that aren't big enough for them Im not really sure what the answer should be to solve this.  I wholeheartedly understand the migratory nature of these creatures and how they shouldnt live in fish bowls but the same could be said for any living animal that is cared for in our zoos and aquariums.  Should bears, monkeys, sharks, lions, giraffes, and elephants have larger enclosures in zoos and aquariums?  You can see that answer at many of our national zoos as they continue to increase their living areas.  The harder problem to solve is how to find the money for those advancements.  What type of impact financially do you think these parks will face after being boycotted?  How is that going to HELP those animals currently in their care?  They CANNOT just let these animals go back into the wild without significant amounts of rehabilitation and preparation; and even then I truly don't think those animals who were born at SeaWorld would EVER be able to adapt in the wild.

SeaWorld is one of the leaders in wildlife rescue and have saved over 27,000 animals who have been hurt, injured, or sick in the wild. Their primary goal when they rescue these wild animals is to be able to release them back into their environment.  Im thankful that they help conserve our natural resources by protecting and saving these precious creatures. They wouldnt be able to continue these efforts if everyone decided to boycott them and there aren't enough non-profit volunteers out there to support massive rescue efforts like those in the 2010 BP oil spill; which saved 100 engendered sea turtles.

Education, this is a big one for me!  If it weren't for parks like SeaWorld, many children would never be able to see these animals up close.  Their parks educate children and adults on how our decisions impact the lives of these animals.  They educate us on how leaving litter on the beaches can impact the health and well being of dolphins in the wild.  I think one of the reasons I have such an affinity to these animals is because SeaWorld inspired me to care more about Orcas and dolphins. SeaWorld inspires people! We wouldn't care mich about Killer Whales if SeaWorld wouldn't exist. Thank you SeaWorld!",1449187200,,4660,4.675245098039215
8541761,1,B009I4QTFO,"I don't need to see the film to know it makes a mockery of the human-animal bond. There is nothing realistic about the orcas that are imprisoned @ Seaworld. Most of their trainers have never seen an orca in the wild.

If you want to see the bond - watch Blackfish. That tells the true story.",1446163200,,291,4.196428571428571

8541764,5,B009I4QTFO,"SeaWorld is the best !
This video brings back all the memories of visiting the park dozens of time while growing up in SOCAL, Millions of visitors became very altruistic towards and concerned about marine mammals only because of SeaWorld. The animals are healthy and happy and enjoy performing, there is no hiding that. Without SeaWorld, orca and dolphins would be just another ""fish"" in the sea.

SeaWorld makes kids dream. The kids scream with delight and want to work with animals. Nowhere on the planet will you witness such a show that is as spectacular as the shows I have seen at SeaWorld and in this video you see how the orca and even the audience interact. SeaWorld has done more for marine mammals than any other organization in the world.

As for the politics, for decades pseudo-animal rights and fringy eco-terrorist organizations have attempted to blackmail SeaWorld out of money. They view SeaWorld as competition for donors. Failing to get what they consider ""their share of the bank"" they slander SeaWorld using as a front wannabes and Dr. Dolittles blacklisted by the industry. These groups now have created an industry out of attack documentaries and false propaganda against SeaWorld. Before one becomes a tool and falls for it they should first research these organizations and the scope of the issues they are involved in what they actually do to help animals. You will find that most of these organizations if not all of them do little or nothing except sell bumper stickers or show up on the beach for photo ops when a whale shows up stranded.

Thank you SeaWorld and all your employees and animals for the memories.",1411257600,2,1641,4.832740213523132

8541766,1,B009I4QTFO,"seaworld is evil. why you might ask? because they are in effect killing and enslaving these beautiful intelligent creatures who are related dolphins. orcas actually live to be quiet old in the wild (they live nearly to be as old as humans. and some times just like humans some live to be 100 or more years old. seaworld would have you believe that their orcas that only live to be 20 to maybe 35 on average is normal). Orcas deserve to be free with their family/pod as they are a social animal like humans that thrive with a close knit group of their own forming, they should never be captured or bread in captivity. these animals are harmed by seaworld as they are kept in too small of a pool, they deserve the ocean and the deep depths of it so they can dive and be happy. they are curious creatures and playful too. that's why they often get bored and go insane harming/killing trainers because they are kept away from their true family/pod, enslaved in a tank forced to do tricks for food and a chance to do some type of stimulating activity (even if its on demand and repetitive), and can even be forced to breed before its time for them to do so (if the baby orca lives its going to be separated from its mother. a lot of their breeding is not successful. which is why they are still hunting these poor orcas down and taking babies from pods/families so that their 2 billion dollar a year company goes on. realize that truly only the rich owners profit). less than one percent of orcas fin flop over in the wild, yet all captive ones do. they can even lose their teeth in captivity because they are trying to escape their cage. if you watch video of them in their tanks when they are not putting on a show for selfish human entertainment and greed, you will see that they are not happy. they are bored, look depressed and show signs of mental illness due to their captivity. thus, for the poorly paid and ill informed trainers its a dangerous job. moreover, there are many stories of how orcas help people in the wildlife, rescuing people. there are even stories of us rescuing them. we need to get back to this. we need to release the captive orcas (even if they only get a moment of wonderful, its better than a lifetime of insanity and depression at any of these water seaworld type places). search the internet and educate yourself on orcas, and the danger/evil/greed of seaworld. I recommend blackfish, the whale, Lolita the enslaved.....for viewing and understanding the travesty that has been allowed to take place. we must stop capture and breeding programs of these magnificent creatures of the ocean, the orca, from the worlds seas.",1408752000,3,2648,4.51875
8541767,1,B009I4QTFO,"SeaWorld claims to be a venue of education, but it is really exploiting animals for money. It claims to inspire people to care about marine life by getting them to perform demeaning tricks. A lot of people I know who are working to stop the dolphin slaughter in Japan have never seen a captive or wild dolphin, yet they still care. What SeaWorld will not tell you is not a single one of their orcas has ever died of old age, and they die at half the age a wild orca does, same with the dolphins.
Do you know how SeaWorld convinces their animals to perform tricks? They hold back food to keep them hungry.
There is no record of an orca harming a human in the wild, but at least four have been killed by captive orcas, three by the same one. Tilikum has been implicated in the deaths of three people from 1991 to 2010. He had already killed once when SeaWorld bought him.

Orcas at SeaWorld routinely must have their teeth drilled because they are always biting on the metal bars. There is a lot of aggression among the whales, likely induced by stress. Sometimes, this aggression has been fatal.

Whales and dolphins cannot even use their sonar in captivity, as it just bounces off the concrete walls.

Furthermore, the methods of acquiring marine animals for the captivity trade are extremely cruel. Up until a few years ago, SeaWorld got their dolphins from Japan, where the dolphins are rounded up and the more desirable ones are taken into the captivity industry, and the rest are stabbed to death. A live dolphin will earn the fishermen more than the meat will, so the aquarium trade is heavily subsidizing the slaughter. It is extremely devastating for dolphins to watch their family members taken away. In fact, their bonds are so strong that the fishermen intentionally wound a few members of the pod, as dolphins never abandon wounded family members. When being taken into captivity, mothers and babies cry out in distress as they are separated.

Orcas fare no better. Bombs, nets and boats are used to herd a pod into a cove where they are all trapped, and the babies are taken. Orcas have very, very strong family bonds. Even when the nets are removed, the rest of the family will not leave the trapped babies. They will even try to follow the boat that takes them away. They are likely never to get over this tragedy, as they have excellent long-term memories.

SeaWorld also routinely separates mothers and babies.

Captivity simply does not work for marine mammals. Those tanks may look large to us, but they are the size of a bathtub to them. SeaWorld says that they are fed, and therefore have no need for space. I ask this: if someone put you in a cage, with nothing for you to do but perform stupid tricks meaningless to you, but fed you regularly, would that be enough?

When researchers did an MRI on an orca brain, they were astonished. they actually have a part of the brain that humans don't. They found an extension of the limbic system, the part of the brain responsible for emotions. Dolphins have this too. These are intelligent, extremely emotional animals. Their emotions may even be more vivid than a human's. We have no right to put them in a small jail cell for our own amusement and financial gain, and make no mistake, that is why it is done.
