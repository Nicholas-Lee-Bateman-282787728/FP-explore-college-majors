8497279,3,B0058N7MPA,"This is an unofficial release of the American Caravan concert in 1986. If you are a SRV fan you will have likely seen much of this already. Stevie is not in his most engaging form in terms of interaction with the audience, most likely due to the format of the gig and the period in his life where he was quite messy with substances. He seems somewhat detached.
One thing he is not detached from is his guitar and his music. His playing still has all of the intensity that other players can only ever aspire to. For me the key highlight was to see Stevie punching out some cheeky slide work on an acoustic guitar with Lonnie Mack on Orea Cookie Blues. We can only imagine what an acoustic album would have sounded like.
The only thing that stops me giving this 4 stars is the god awful banner across the bottom of the entire gig blocking much of his playing.
The bonus track has Stevie on stage with BB King, Albert Collins in New Orleans 1988. I would sell one of my children to have been able to be at that gig. BB King is in blistering form, SRV is clean and amazing, and Albert Collins gets all too short a crack at his solo.
Overall  this is worth having for a fan but probably not the best place for a first time visitor to the SRV catalogue.",1357862400,3,1247,4.195833333333334
