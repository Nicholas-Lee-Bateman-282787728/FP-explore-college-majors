The music,of its type and style,was the best in the world. Thanks to the producers of this product for putting it on the market. It is wonderful!",1313712000,,293,4.653846153846154
7845196,5,6303399312,"Here's what you get on this collection of shorts: First, there's a Desi Arnaz piece. Next we see Larry Clinton and His Orchestra, which is where you see those fascinating Philharmonicas discussed by the first reviewer. Next is Victor Lopez and His Orchestra with Betty Hutton. This short is fun because of Betty Hutton's high-energy antics; she does a frantic version of Old Man Mose. It is also of interest because we get a look a violinist David Rubinoff (you may know him from the Betty Boop cartoons). Woody Herman and His Orchestra, followed by Jimmie Lunceford and His Orchestra, perform in the next two shorts. Next we get Cliff Edwards and His Buckaroos. This odd piece features Cliff (otherwise known as Ukulele Ike) in a cowboy setting. My favorite film short is the next one, Don Redman and His Orchestra. Don was a prodigy who could play every instrument in the band, although here you see him as band leader and vocalist. He performs ""Yeah, Man,"" ""Ill Wind,"" ""Nagasaki,"" and ""Why Should I Be Tall.""  Nagasaki is particularly funny, with the hilarious performance of the enigmatic Red and Struggie. In Ill Wind, one skit involves a character addressed as Mr. Handy. I am wondering if the elderly gentleman in the skit was actually W.C. Handy. Following an unremarkable piece featuring Stan Kenton and His Orchestra, we get an excellent Cab Calloway short. It is titled (can you guess?) ""Hi-De-Ho,"" and features Cab performing ""I've Got a Right to Sing the Blues,"" ""Hi-De-Ho Miracle Man,"" and ""Frisco Flo."" This is a very well-done short with superb sets, bizarre characters (the deacon and his fortune-telling wife), and Cab at his vocal best. He ends the short with some spectacular scat singing. And that's what you get on this video, worth the price for the Redman and Calloway shorts alone.",985305600,6,1806,4.863636363636363
