Some good exercises in the DVD and the guy I'm sure has a lot of skill, yet does not show much in here, what he does show is very good. Too short for my liking, more could have been done. Stick with Dr Yang Jwing Ming for more informative and bang for your buck Tai-Chi or even Glenn Hairston and his Tai-Chi DVD series.",1383091200,,505,3.912621359223301

Much to my delight, I found the DVD to be a treasure trove of new and easy to follow information which has helped me further understand and enhance the forms and techniques that I have been practicing for years. I recommend Tai Chi Combat for any true martial arts enthusiast who has a real desire to augment their understanding of the practical application and appreciation of this wonderful art.",1372118400,,537,4.663157894736842
