8468492,5,B005ELVCLQ,"We used to watch this short movie on Netflix when my oldest was a little bit younger, and he loved it. Every time the penguins danced, he danced. It's silly and funny, and we enjoy watching it. Since it had been a while since we were able to watch it (with how they add and remove movies all the time), I decided to buy it so we can see it over and over..",1471046400,,355,3.8767123287671232
8468493,5,B005ELVCLQ,"It was a requested gift, personally, I haven't seen it, but those squeals of delight were there.  The recipients didn't think they would get Tappy Toes - ever - but there it was on my Amazon site.  Yay!",1388448000,,202,4.2894736842105265
8468494,4,B005ELVCLQ,"The quality of the cartoon is fairly low in comparison with movies like Finding Nemo and Happy Feet.  But, what it lacks in visual quality, it makes up for in laughs.  I'm a fussy movie watcher and this movie is really rather different.  I would pay $10 for it because my kids seem to enjoy it and find the characters funny.  It's not over sexualized like Happy Feet and it's just a classic little cartoon.",1375401600,2,406,4.373333333333333
8468495,1,B005ELVCLQ,"This movie clears people out of your house faster than an old man with a bean addiction clears out an elevator.

My greatest regret is that I can't give it less than one star in my review.",1365638400,6,188,4.081081081081081
8468496,5,B005ELVCLQ,"This film is the third in the saga of six occurring before Happy Feet, yet after Crappy Nuts and the introductory feature, Sarah Palin Got Her Power From Carl's Foreigner Belt. Enjoy Tappy Toes as you await episode five, Slappy Teats, this summer. Fine production with subtle Eastern influences make this a film. Newborns love watching it at naptime.",1335225600,8,350,4.9491525423728815
8468497,5,B005ELVCLQ,"this movie is fantastic for parenting, this movie is so bad that not only do kids dislike it, they actively hate it! the movie works on animals too, my dog hates it and will start barking, and my cat still just lies there but it looks at me with extra hate in its eyes.

anyway whenever my children annoy me over petty things i just turn on the movie and they leave me alone. its great

be warned, you will end up memorizing every word, but its a small price to pay",1333497600,21,465,4.043478260869565
