Quick ""where I'm coming from"". I like Asian series and have now watched quite a few. I'm not a strong fan of any particular actors so no boosting because of who's in the series. I always avoid using dubs so can't comment on that aspect at all. Though a bit difficult to find there are far more erudite reviews out there than this will be, just be very careful about spoilers.

The series is a ""G"" for the rating in my opinion and is family safe.

I nearly didn't obtain this one as the synopsis made me think ""how could you spin the idea out over a series"", for example I instantly thought Groundhog Day which was fine for movie length but no more. Then again the idea of redoing things intrigued me so I thought ""what the heck"".

I will be vague here, sorry, in an attempt to avoid spoilers, loathe them.

The redo it idea is really well done, each episode, though the aim is the same, is a different story so there was no trouble about repetitiveness for me.

I liked the main characters, there was a real feeling that the group of friends that make up the principals were close knit and just that, long term friends. The potential romantic leads were excellent IMHO. Kudos to the writers for making each of the rivals for affection basically good people. There is no easy cop out in making anyone a bit of a baddie so as it's easy to say ""naw they shouldn't get their desired partner"".

There are genuine comic moments that make you laugh out loud.

Note I found episode 1 to be a bit slow and one of the weaker ones in the series. It's the usual problem of having to set up the story. So don't stop there, keep watching.

The ""fairy"" is not your usual wand waver so don't let the mention of a fairy put you off thinking ""aw, kid's stuff"".

The series length at 11 episodes, which is shorter than a lot of Asian series, is ideal for someone who wants to test the waters so to speak with watching an Asian based series for the first time. It is also suitable for the story device. I don't think a longer series would have suited the basic premise here at all.

CONs

If you don't like characters that don't get to the point you probably won't like this, the premise is based on being a bit indecisive (with some bad timing thrown in as well) to provide the storyline. Then again it allows for something like the parable of the water dripping on a stone which I thought was pretty well implied.

Some considered the method of revisiting the past to become annoying and repetitive. Me, it's only a few seconds out of an hours viewing, no big deal and it's funny the first time certainly. I liked the idea of the ""trigger"" that propelled the switches back to the present, thought that was quite clever since it ties in with the device that propels the lead back in time in the first place. Lastly the repeated exclamation each time we go back may indeed be that the process is a bit painful, certainly it is implied to be very disorientating till bearings are achieved.

The reintroduction of a particular item is also stretching the bounds of possibility as well, could have been plotted better IMHO. A forgive based on my liking for the series overall

The timing of the reveal, as I'll call it, was awkward. Considering where the main action ""today"" was centred this was always going to be a difficult one to resolve. It did jar for me and may well be a sticking point for other viewers. Because I'd liked the series up to that point I forgave it so to speak. In addition, from reading other reviews later, I found that Japanese and Western ceremonies have an important difference so that the writing for the domestic market would not have considered this so jarring. Can't be more specific here as it would give away some of the story IMHO.

There is a ""special"" for this series also somewhat akin to a movie. Note it is not a summary of the series here but a new story which does involve the characters from this series and similar plot devices. IMHO it is not essential viewing, however it is quite good in its own rite and ties up some of the loose ends from the series so overall I'd recommend it especially if you liked this one.

Summary

There are no high powered action scenes, if you crave those you mightn't like it, as I said, if you like strong decisive leads this may not be your cup of tea but, hey, who hasn't wavered thinking ""if I spill the beans will that mean I lose any chance with that person forever"".

It's a movie with teen to early 20's characters with the ideas and values of that age. That may put off someone looking for a  serious romance but, hey, it's not pitched as being a deep thinkers film either.

My wife and teenage daughter also thoroughly enjoyed it. I think it was more ""romance"" than shallow ""chick flick"" and thoroughly enjoyed it.

Give this one a try and I hope you'll like it. If you're not an Asian series watcher perhaps it will serve to introduce you to a whole new area of entertainment. There is some good stuff out there that you will never see on mainstream channels.",1391299200,3,5094,4.362579281183932
