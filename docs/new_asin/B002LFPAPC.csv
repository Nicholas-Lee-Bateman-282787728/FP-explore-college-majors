3945911,5,B002LFPAPC,I have recently started to study Tai Chi and have purchased several DVDs. I found John Milton's T'ai Chi for Liberation easy to understand and simple to follow. I took notes and within several days was standing outside doing the movements with confidence. I enjoyed the peace that came with his 'meditation in motion' and the gentle stretch and upper body movement required. This DVD has given me confidence to try explore more Tai Chi.,1297468800,6,436,4.826666666666667
3945912,5,B002LFPAPC,A sharing of a Tai Chi form that is truly rare and barely known in the world today -- a real gem.  A very comprehensive teaching of this form.  Nicely and briefly explains some of the important roots and core principles of Tai Chi and even Taoism as well.  One of my outstanding experiences of learning this form is the mandala-like feeling it generates through its relationship with all directions during the practice.  John P. Milton presents this form in a very relaxed and comprehensive manner.  Beautifully filmed in outdoor nature with good sound quality and enough close-up to clearly see the form.,1267920000,3,605,4.834951456310679
3945913,5,B002LFPAPC,"Master teacher John P. Milton brings us a rarely-known form out of 13th century China. Whether you are a Qi Gong beginner or veteran, you will find this practice deeply moving. As it honors and connects you with earth and sky, you will attain a profound inner peace. Additionally, with T'ai Chi for Liberation, you will realize optimum physical health as you circulate vital energy and stimulate the flowing energy of awakening and enlightment throughout your entire being. I let my heart open to this practice, and am forever transformed.",1267142400,7,539,5.0
3945914,5,B002LFPAPC,"This elegant training will open the practitioner's heart as well as ground her in the balance between Heaven and Earth.  A deceivingly simple form, I have found that without clear awareness moment by moment this form, no matter how many years I have practiced it, will show me my distraction in a playfully humbling manner.  The DVD itself is beautifully set in the sacred land of Arches National Park as well as skillfully presented for the student to learn the form quickly.  Afterward, the student will then be able to use it to hone the finer points through continued practice.  The short teaser of the upcoming film created by Sarah Sher of Wudang Temple is worth the price of the DVD itself.",1263427200,9,697,4.688524590163935
3945915,5,B002LFPAPC,"On his latest DVD, John P. Milton presents a rare opportunity to observe and learn a Tai Chi form that was ""lost"" for centuries.  Few teachers in the United States have received training in this form.  Deepening his understanding of this ancient method for internal qi cultivation with years of his own practice, John leads instructional workshops and offers this video for the benefit of others.

T'ai Chi for Liberation has been created with loving care and attention to emphasize the beauty of cultivating inner and outer nature.  In addition to the magnificent film setting in Utah's red rock country, you will not want to miss the exclusive footage from Wudang Mountain, China.",1263427200,8,682,5.008849557522124
8372669,5,B002LFPAPC,I have been a long term T'ai Chi and Qi Gong practitioner and teacher. I can't say enough good things about this addition to John Milton's body of work and his commitment to share his knowledge and experience. It is a rare thing for a westerner to be invited to the Wudang Monastery and introduced to this ancient form. It is a statement to John's commitment to share for him to produce such a beautiful and accessible DVD to introduce this form to the West. I appreciate the balance between the specifics of the form coupled with underlying internal aspects. I highly recommend this to new and experienced practitioners.,1515888000,,621,4.706422018348624

8372671,5,B002LFPAPC,"This form is simple, easy to learn and yet very powerful.

I have practice a medical/healing form of qigong for about 12 years now. And my practice of this form  has helped me in the practice of medical qigong for my rheumatoid arthritis.

If I only have time for one form, this is the form which I use now.",1452124800,,307,4.169491525423729

8372673,3,B002LFPAPC,"Too much of Milton's philosophy and not many of the standard moves.  I'm taking classes from a teacher of Wang Tai Chi who studies with Dr. Wong, so that may be the difference.",1424736000,,176,4.333333333333333
8372674,5,B002LFPAPC,"A relaxing and thorough T'ai Chi DVD. I liked how it explained all of the moves first and then put them together in the routine. I find a lot of peace and serenity during and after doing this DVD. Also, it's an easy routine to do, even if you've never done T'ai Chi before. I'm physically disabled and even I could do it.",1414886400,,321,4.111111111111111

8372676,5,B002LFPAPC,"I love the slow, calm feeling of Tai Chi and the fact of thanking the Mother Earth. We need to realize that Mother Earth is a living
thing who sustains us everyday. We need to stop abusing her. Without the Sun and Mother Earth none of us would be here today.
Tai Chi is a very beautiful way to thank her and distress at the same time.",1366416000,,334,4.0
8372677,5,B002LFPAPC,"Just to be clear, the form taught on this DVD is not a t'ai chi ch'uan form such as those of the Chen and Yang families. It might be considered t'ai chi in the broader sense of bringing together opposing energies (i.e. Yin and Yang). This form is also known as Wuji Gong or Primordial Qigong, and involves gathering the energetic qualities of heaven, earth and the four directions. The form was said to have been created 800 years ago by the legendary Zhang San Feng of Wudang Mountain, who is also attributed with the creation of t'ai chi ch'uan after watching a crane and a snake fighting. John Milton, the instructor on this DVD, also learned the form at Wudang Mountain (more recently!).

The form consists of two cycles, the earth and the heaven cycle, which are each repeated four times, starting in each of the four cardinal directions, beginning with facing the East. An interesting thing about the form is that although the practioner only turns in a counterclockwise direction, the starting points move in a clockwise direction. The movements of the cycles are easy to learn, keeping track of which direction you are facing can be a little more challenging. Fortunately this DVD includes an onscreen compass which simplifies this process. The names of the movements are also displayed onscreen. The setting is a mountainous desert in Utah, with the instructor and three students. Milton's narration is low key, yet effective. The production values are excellent, as you would expect from Sounds True products.

After an introduction on the background of the form, Milton gives some practice tips and defines some basic qigong terminology such as lao gong and lower dan tien. One round of the earth and heaven cycles are demonstrated, then there is a detailed instruction section covering all of the movements. Finally there are practice along sessions of the entire form, one with instruction and no music, the other with music and no instruction. The music is Tibetan and Native American style flute music.

Unlike ""real"" t'ai chi ch'uan, this form is simple enough that you actually could learn to perform it from a DVD (of course learning any form from a ""live"" instructor is preferable, but they are not always available). And for me at least, the energetic qi sensations  it produces are tangible. I've been practicing this form for over a year now, and it's become one of my favorites, and part of my regular rotation. I would also recommend Michael Winn's DVD ""Tai Chi for Enlightenment"" which is on the same form, as it provides some complementary information that is not included on this one. Try this form, you'll like it!",1322352000,15,2642,4.864444444444445
8372678,3,B002LFPAPC,"More of a Chi Kung set than a tai chi form. But taught very well, good production quality. I think the Name is a little misleading.",1299456000,3,131,4.076923076923077
