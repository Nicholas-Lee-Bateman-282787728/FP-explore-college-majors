2478966,4,B000E1E7UE,"""I Dream of Jeannie: The Complete Series""  collects all five seasons of the comedy sitcom, which premiered in September, 1965.  Astronaut Tony Nelson (Larry Hagman) is on a space mission that aborts, forcing him to parachute onto a desert island.  While waiting for a rescue team, he finds an old bottle that has washed ashore.  When he opens the bottle, out pops a 2000-year-old, though quite well preserved, genie (Barbara Eden), who promptly regards Tony as her master, since he has set her free.
 Returning to Florida with the rescue team, Tony soon discovers that no one will believe he has found a voluptuous genie, chalking his claim up to delusions caused by exposure to the elements.  To further complicate matters, the genie, named Jeannie, refuses to perform magic or ever appear for anyone except Tony.  During the last three seasons, Ms. Eden also played Jeannie's wicked twin sister.
 The 20-disc set includes 139 episodes packaged in a limited- edition genie bottle, audio commentary with the show's stars, interviews with Barbara Eden and Larry Hagman, and collector's cards with photos, episode synopses, trivia, and cast profiles.",1226707200,8,1148,5.134408602150538
2478967,1,B000E1E7UE,This post refers to the 15 disc set of The Complete I Dream of Jeannie series being offered for $199.99. This is impossible as Sony never pressed the entire series on just 15 discs. The complete series isn`t due to be released to the public until 11-11-08. Beware of this set being offered by third party seller(s). Wait for the legitimately released set by Sony.,1225929600,4,363,4.6
2478968,3,B000E1E7UE,"It's a great set. It will feature the TV movie I Dream of Jeannie 15 Years Later (1985). If you go to tvshowsondvd.com they list this set and the features. I emailed sony because I too think they should release one set with Black and White. I also told them that they should release the movie separately along with the second TV movie I Still Dream of Jeannie(1991). I think they should have put the movie on Season 5 as a bonus. This set is a slap in the face and a way to get money out of people. It doesn't benefit those of us who already own Seasons 1-3 or 1-4. The set is good for those who have no I Dream of Jeannie at all. And because it's still inprint, it wouldn't be worth it to try to sell it for a few bucks. I hope Sony takes my suggestion. I hate when companies pull these tricks to get money out of people.",1225843200,6,822,3.987878787878788
2478969,5,B000E1E7UE,This complete series box set comes with a replica of the 1964 James Beam decanter that was used as Jeannie`s bottle. I am amazed that Amazon has chosen not to picture or mention this as this is a big selling point for this set. I tried to upload a picture of what this set includes but Amazon would not allow it.,1225670400,4,312,4.131147540983607
2478970,5,B000E1E7UE,"I loved this series from my childhood.  I don't know for sure, but it looks like the first season included will be the colorized version.  I wish they would release one box set with the first season in b&w also.  Does anyone have any thoughts about this?",1225411200,4,254,4.361702127659575
2478971,2,B000E1E7UE,Again the idiocy of more expensive full set DVDs. You can buy separate 5 seasons for $50 less on Amazon.,1219622400,7,104,4.25

2478974,5,B000E1E7UE,"id love to buy the whole series at once, instead of waiting for each seprate release, but how is this possible, does anyone own the whole series, please leave feedback for the rest of us !!!!!!",1142035200,2,193,4.388888888888889

Well worth the money.
Jeannie Out of the Bottle.",1517097600,,202,4.075
2478996,1,B000E1E7UE,"I love ""I Dream Of Jeannie"" and have since the 70's when I was a kid. Yet, the only way you could go cheaper on this so called ""I Dream Of Jeannie"" dvd collection is to set each disk in their own tissue and through them all into a ziplock bag.

To start off, the dvds come in a cheap, flimsy box and the disks are set inside scratchy, cardboard sleeves. Second, each show is cheaply stretched to appear that it's widescreen, but any amateur eye can tell it's not been modified correctly. Then to make it worse, for some reason the lighting has been lowered and more color has been added to compensate for the whole mess.

It's the old saying. Spend cheap, get cheap.

While they are still available, best to buy this original show on dvd, one season at a time. I do understand that the first season was originally in black and white as it is on this cheap box set, but it would be way better to get it in color when buying season one. If you could care less on quality or resolution and ""dirt cheap"" is you, then this would be right up your alley.

Also you can still get this full season 1-5 collection in a more stunning quality box set here on Amazon.com",1516579200,11,1157,4.198198198198198

Cons: The packaging for this is horrendous. It's all in one clump of pile (I mean there's 5+) discs that they throw in a plastic block box. But for the price it's worth it.

I have read one complaint about the picture quality on the Mill Creek series.  I have read a number of complaints on packaging, but I am not sure which series they refer to - the 2008, 2013, or the 2015.

There is so much bad and distasteful things going on in today's world. In my opinion TV isn't any better with all of the tensions of the shoot'ed up and kill themes. This is my escape from the real world. I think it is a  great family show with interesting story lines that keep one's attention to see how they are going to get out of the many situations the pretty Jeannie gets them into trying to please her master.

2479059,3,B000E1E7UE,"This review is for the Mill Creek DVD set, NOT the Sony DVDs. (I say this because Amazon groups together reviews from all versions.)

The Mill Creek version is perfect for the casual viewer who wants inexpensive access to this fun series. Collectors will absolutely want to stay away from this set!

Mill Creek has a poor reputation for quality, and they don't do anything here to improve on that reputation. The image compression fluctuates throughout each episode due to the fact that they cram twelve (or more) episodes on each disc. If you just want to experience the series, this set will be fine, but if you are a fan and collector, it will greatly disappoint you.

The packaging continues this trend. It's a sort of slip case made from cardstock, with several loose cardstock sleeves holding 2 DVDs each. Every time I pick it up, The top tries to slide off, threatening to spill the entire set onto the floor. The box is easily creased and crushed.

Also, it's worth noting that I researched the colorized edition, but when I viewed the used copies, I was unaware that Amazon had sent me to sellers of the set containing a mix of color and black & white episodes. This is because Amazon combines similar items in a confusing and convoluted way. (I decided to keep the mixed set, and buy the colorized seasons separately because it was MUCH cheaper.)",1485043200,3,1356,4.6375

2479084,2,B000E1E7UE,"Be very careful to look at edition year and studio. The earlier 2013 is the Sony Studios version that comes in the black plastic spindle box. I've had this set up before without problem, I don't mind it. The later 2015 version comes from Mill Creek. While I don't have as much problem with their DVD quality as others have mentioned, only 12 disks vs 20, I hate the cardboard sleeves they come in that scratch too easily. Yes, you can transfer to other cases, if you have them, but if you don't, it's more cost/hassle to add. And if they're already scratched too bad. Depending on when purchased they can be the same price, so just watch the ups and downs.

2479125,5,B000E1E7UE,"Another one of my all time favorites. I got the DVD set about a month ago and watch a few episodes here and there. I'm on my sixth episode of the day today and just had to take a 'time out' to brag on the series. Its from my childhood days and I can remember coming home from school and watching it in the evenings. It was a simpler time and a much more wholesome and cleaner time. A time when you weren't afraid to let your kids watch ANY of the shows on the television because there was no dirty language or inappropriate things like seen in todays programs. I can still remember watching the first episode with my late father. The one where the Major landed on the island and found Genie's bottle and set the framework for the rest of the series. It's a good 'fantasy' show. Who hasn't dreamed of finding a genies bottle and having someone to 'wish away' all of the troubles that life piles on us? I know I spent many childhood days thinking about it! And, I still smile and giggle watching. It's one reason I'm watching it today. Life's been down a little lately and I needed a 'cheer me up'. The series has definitely done the job and lifted the spirits for me! If you're looking for something clean to watch for family night, this is it. It still makes me smile like it did when I was a kid, watching it. Wonderful Program! Why can't we have some like these made today? It does make you wonder if society would be a better place if we had kept it clean and simple instead of moving into the wild and crazy programs of today? Anyways, if you're interested in clean fantasy type programs, this is the one for you. You could put it on for your preschoolers and never worry about them seeing or hearing anything inappropriate. Buy it and enjoy!",1468281600,,1746,4.277945619335347
2479126,1,B000E1E7UE,"I Dream of Jeannie is an excellent comedy.  However, the studio which produced this set, Mill Creek Entertainment could of done better.
First, the Disks come in a cheap, flimsy box and the disks are inserted in cardboard sleeves.
Second, I wondered how they managed to squeeze 10 episodes on each disk.  The answer is that they lowered the bitrate of the videos to shrink down the file size of each video.  Which, in turn made the videos play at a lower quality.  Mill Creek Entertainment is known for taking old video files, the same ones placed on VHS tapes and dumping them on to DVD disk.  They do this with their DVD movies all the time.  DVD disks produced by Mill Creek Video should be avoided at all costs.  Next time you shop for a DVD and it is one made by Mill Creek Entertainment, look at the box and if it does not prominently show  what the aspect ratio of the movie(s) are, chances it is an old video file dumped on a DVD disk and not a new digital transfer.  16:9 anamorphic widescreen is generally the newer transfers for movies that were originally filmed in widescreen.  If it cleverly does not list the aspect ratio, you are being deceived.",1467849600,97,1160,4.429245283018868

2479222,4,B000E1E7UE,"I love this show, but the packaging was very poor. It came in a thin, black, single stack holder that slipped into the thin cardboard design case. I was very pleased with the quality of the DVDs but was very disappointed with this packaging. That being said, I have looked at some of the other reviews of this product and was very confused when some were talking about a cardboard bottle package with an accordion style sleeve design for the DVDs. Everything that I read about that was talking about how the DVDs would fall out everywhere and how low quality the bottle thing was. I looked up the bottle thing on Google Images and it looked kind of cute, but also like it would be a disaster, so having the black stack thing does seem better compared to the bottle thing. Eventually I hope to be able to get a better case system for this collection (and the Bewitched collection when I'm able to get that, too [I read it has the same black stack system]). I hope my review isn't too confusing, but the basic point is that this is a great series packaged very poorly in different ways.

Also, I'm currently 21 years old and my son is 4 months, when we watch this show I'll play with him, whenever he hears the theme song he stops whatever he's doing to watch it, so I'd say he's a fan as well!",1447718400,,1292,4.295081967213115

2479293,4,B000E1E7UE,"This is a review of the re-release from 2013.  This set includes every episode from all 5 seasons.

I'm sure most people are familiar with the premise of this show.  It is definitely silly and dated, but still fun to watch for adults (kids will love it).  It is good, clean, mindless entertainment.  I really like to look at the fashions & dcor from the 1960s.  There are some great guest stars, too, like Sammy Davis, Jr., Bob Denver, Phil Spector (!), Milton Berle, the cast of Laugh-In, and Don Ho.  There is also a very rare appearance of the short-lived band The Lewis and Clarke Expedition (in Jeannie, the Guru).

This set appears to have the same discs as the original Complete Series release, but is much cheaper due to the packaging, which deserves zero stars.  Basically, all 20 discs are stacked on top of each other on a plastic spindle of the same quality as a disposable restaurant coffee cup lid.  This is slid into a glossy box which has a list of episodes typed out.  You're going to have to invest in some DVD jewel cases if you intend to take the discs out more than a couple times.

Also, the first season is colorized.  It looks OK, but I prefer the original black and white.  And despite the claim on the package that this is ""loaded with bonus features,"" I could only find one, a nice documentary with the season one discs.  There are subtitle/language choices and ""previews"" as well, but I don't consider these real bonus features.

All in all, this is great for the price.",1436227200,3,1498,4.472324723247232

2479295,1,B000E1E7UE,"Though I appreciate the price for the complete series, I do not in the engineering of the package. The outside appearance of the box is nice, the discs inside is another matter. Each one is stacked one on top of the other with no protection between each disc. Thought in use of each disc was absent. Each disc would have to be pulled out as you progress in your viewing leaving each disc pulled out unprotected until you finish watching and you restack your pile.  I love the program. Disappointed greatly on how I will experience my viewing as my pile of discs increase outside the box.",1436140800,4,587,4.485981308411215
2479296,5,B000E1E7UE,"I find the packaging to be easy and simple. Watching the whole series has made me realized how brilliantly talented Larry Hagman, Barbara Eden and Bill Daily truly were and are!

2479323,4,B000E1E7UE,I Loved watching all the series again.  The only reason I gave this a 4 is because I don't like how the dvds are stored.  They should remake this set and put them each on their own spot just like so many other boxed sets.  I am worried that if I watch them over and over that they will get scratched from being one on top of the other.  Besides that the set is perfect.

2479362,4,B000E1E7UE,"Very good video & sound quality. It would have been nice if the discs could have been packaged differently than stacking on a plastic spindle but no doubt that would have resulted in added cost. The series is great and very funny in a wholesome, family friendly way. Reminds me of how network tv content quality has greatly deteriorated over the years.",1426204800,,352,4.693548387096774

2479365,5,B000E1E7UE,Great series that I am enjoying once more. I think that 'Jeannie' is beautiful and it is nice to see Larry Hagman looking so youthful and well. Both of them are really good actors. I also like the fact that nobody uses foul language. That is refreshing to me. It is always a good show for a laugh or two or maybe three. It makes me feel good and probably lowers my blood pressure to watch my old favorites again.,1426118400,2,412,4.1625
2479366,5,B000E1E7UE,"I also bought this DVD set for a friend. I love it, and he loves it. I enjoy the I Dream of Jeannie sitcom. Barbara Eaton is a fine actress.",1425945600,,140,3.7

2479369,5,B000E1E7UE,"Yes, to echo what others have said - this box is merely two stacks of discs on the cheapest plastic spindles they could find. But, people, feel the box. It is so flimsy it is clearly disposable. Do as I have done: merely put all 20 discs in an Amaray case or maybe zip pouch and toss out that box. Here you have a budget release for a reason. It may be a bit inconvenient at first, but this Sony release was designed to deliver the exact same discs found in that nightmare of a cardboard bottle complete series release in 2008. This is a definite step up, and saves you some cash. Also, others have complained the episodes are out of order; Sony did not do that, NBC did! Yes, they were aired out of order (creating a few plot holes) back in the 60's so Sony was merely trying to preserve the original broadcast order. As for the series itself, well, you wouldn't be here in the first place if you were unfamiliar with it. The world's first fictional genie that was a young pretty FEMALE, I doubt there are many people left on earth who wouldn't recognize this show's premise/title/theme song in some way. The series has aged beautifully as the costumes are rather timeless and the storylines rely on situation rather than topical stories. As someone who wasn't even born when it originally aired, I can attest to the series' enduring qualities. The humor, astronaut aspect, plots, even the special effects all rarely feel dated in the 139-episode show. Blink up your copy today!",1425427200,2,1479,4.522388059701493
2479370,5,B000E1E7UE,"A series that I really had no interest in when it was on-air in 1965. I recently had the chance to watch it on Antenna tv and just laughed so hard and really enjoyed it.

2479372,4,B000E1E7UE,"I love ""I dream of Jeannie this review is about the product not the show itself. The episodes are NOT in order example: there's an episode in season 2 where dr bellows is telling another government person about when major Nelson made it snow in July over his house and only
His house.. A few episodes later on the disc is when you actually see the scene where it's snowing over his house only. Also the packaging is horrible. All the discs are piled on top of eachother. The Rosanne box set this works because each disc has its own paper sleeve.. I dream of Jeannie they are literally piled on top of one another so to get a disc from say season 5 you need to remove all the discs to get to it which will more
Than likely end in scratching.. But other than that it's the complete series for under $30 so for that price I just bought a cd booklet to keep the discs safe",1424908800,,868,4.1420118343195265

2479411,4,B000E1E7UE,"I loved I dream of Jennie ... when I was a younger guy. The packaging of this series is okay  .... I didn't know to my surprise that the first two season were originally in Black & White & that the Famous I Dream of Jennie theme music we all like to hum along with... I will say this though Sony pictures making this a once in a buy ... The package is a little crappy but ... it is a great price to have all of Major Nelson & Jennie, and the rest of the cast. My only hold back is that you don't get a holding package for each season .. and the plus side is that both Seasons 1 & 2 have been colorized ... but if you like them in Black and white... just turn down your color and watch them in Black & White.  the other thing is there is only the front opening to see what episodes are on the disks. But have no fear and you can go to www. Sharetv.com and get each shows recap of what the show is going to be about . One last thing ... if you are one to fuss over that they are not in there own season boxes ... then I suggest to you to go out & get a cd /dvd case holder and still enjoy the show.",1422403200,2,1096,3.6794871794871793

Also an episode stops during showing I would send it back but I had a problem with another complete series called Stingray, I sent it back and received another complete series but had a similar problem with the new one sent back to me. I do not recommend buying complete series DVD's because I have had problems twice with two different complete series. I don't think I'll ever buy a complete series DVD set again.",1415318400,,512,4.4

2479545,5,B000E1E7UE,"I really enjoy watching this series. This is the second attempt at an entire season collection. This is minus the bottle which I had read was cumbersome and took up too much space. This time it is just like the ""Bewitched"" complete series where all of the disks are on a spool sitting on top of each other. I own many, many DVDS and I know this is not the best way to package them. But I also believe that if you are careful you can continue watching these disks over and over with no problem. If you are really concerned, then maybe buy some disk envelopes and label them with episodes and you can sometimes find cases for them. Or buy your own jewel plastic cases and keep them there. It's a pain to do that and more expensive, but it's the best you can do. I will do that in some circumstances but probably not in this one. The black and white seasons are colorized and really do look beautiful. I am happy with this set-up and the price is not bad for the entire series.",1414800000,8,974,4.1861702127659575

2479560,4,B000E1E7UE,"Terrific series, one I remember fondly from my days as a little boy infatuated with the whole astronaut thing, and of course Jeannie. Naturally as it turns out, she completely ruined my life giving me that example as a 4yo boy that women are fun, fearless and unconditionally loving, when in fact they are cold-blooded manipulative, indifferent, game-playing lizards! :) I think I have spent my whole life searching unsuccessfully for that kind-hearted, go-get-him Jeannie! Ha ha HA! But alas women with their whole indifferent, passive, hard to get schtick are In fact, the complete opposite of her!

I DO jest, but the interesting thing here with this series is that Jeannie is in fact the ""male"", and channels all the qualities of the male energy in pursuit, and Tony Nelson is the female, being chased. I guess that explains why Jeannie is rare for a woman and why I loved her so! It's actually quite clever writing and not what you think on the surface, with what appears to be the setup of this series, a woman acting as servant. Nope, she knows what she wants and she will stop at nothing to get it. Unusual for romance writing too, for the woman to be so forthright, knowing what she wants, and setting out to get it directly, using the typical male energy traits of relentless pursuit.

As far as the disks are concerned, yes there are some sound menu LOUDNESS snafus mainly with disk 1, but they settle down once you move onto other disks. My only complaint would be that the first season, which was shot in black and white (and it would have been lovely to have seen that season in black and white), has been colorised, and the colorisation (with its creepy grey teeth) is hit and miss. Would have been wonderful for the show to have been presented as it screened, but it is understandable that for syndication purposes, whereby they would mix and match episodes, that they wanted them all in ""color"" for that flexibility. Still, disappointing not to have seen the whole first season in black and white.

Of note, there is a commentary on the colorised pilot episode with Eden, Hagman and Daily, where Daily comments about how wonderful the black and white looks. (In between every second word of him gushing breathlessly, ""gorgeous"" every time Eden appears.) Unfortunately it's not a great commentary, they just giggle at the episode and only Eden tries to provide some little snippets of behind the scenes interest. Other than her they just look at it like a bunch of regular viewers. Hagman doesn't seem to remember anything, he probably was in a perpetual fog, and Daily is busy flirting with Eden.

All in all a classic series, with good performances and funny situations all round, including Hayden Rorke, often hysterical as Dr Bellows.",1413676800,2,2754,4.74321503131524

2479562,5,B000E1E7UE,"I hesitated to purchase this item based on earlier reviews, but decided to take the chance.  I'm glad that I bought it.  To address some of the issues brought up by other buyers, I would like to mention the packaging, discs and quality of the product.  Yes, the packaging has a well type place for the discs, but it has a spindle which prevents the discs from getting damaged. The discs are all imprinted with the episode data on each disc, Example: Season One, Disc 1, Episodes 1-8; Season 2, Disc 5, Episodes 1-7.  Yes, it might have been nicer to start the disc numbering over with each season, but for the difference in pricing compared to each individual season, I can read the labels.  Besides, each season has different colored printing to help differentiate the different seasons.  The video quality is very good, considering the age of the originals.  For less than the price of Season Five alone, you can have the entire series.  I wish shows like Gunsmoke would be released this way and allow people to be able to afford them.  I grew up watching Gunsmoke, but I will never own the set at the price it sells for now.  Hundreds of dollars is ridiculous.",1412812800,5,1163,4.548076923076923

2479580,5,B000E1E7UE,"I see nothing wrong at all with this product. Some reviewers were complaining about functionality problems with the set but I saw absolutely none of those problems. This set contains all 5 seasons of I Dream of Jeannie. The discs are all set securely in a little spindle inside the box. They don't move around or anything, they are completely secure. The first season is colorized, but really, it's not that big of a deal. Yes, the telephone is orange but sheesh who cares? The coloring is just fine in my opinion but they do have the first season in black and white if people can't stand it in color. My husband hates black and white tv so the colorized first season works out good. All the episodes are labeled clearly in the box. The discs are labeled 1-20 instead of ""season one, disc one"" etc... but it really doesn't cause any confusion. Btw I am reviewing the complete series that comes in a small purple box (about eight inches tall and a couple inches thick) but it sounds like some reviewers are reviewing some kind of collector's version of this product or something. I can't speak for them but the product I received is perfect. The main menu does seem to be a bit louder than the show, but really all you have to do is hit the mute button if it bothers you that much. This boxed set is completely watchable. There is no real flaw that I can see. It's a small compact box that has all the episodes clearly laid out and easy to watch at an affordable price.

I personally love the show. Its nice to watch a tv show for once that doesn't assault my ears with dirty language every other word and can make you laugh to the point of tears without resorting to crude talk of body parts and body functions or indecent talk of women's bodies. It's also nice that at this point in history when the show was made that feminism was still counter-cultural so being a housewife is promoted and there's no showing of broken families or illegitimacy and blended families and all the problems we have in the post-feminist world that is shown in every modern show and movie.

2479586,4,B000E1E7UE,"I Dream of Jeanie is remembered, as are most of the pantheon of 1960's shows, because it was a hit and it was incredibly simple.  The premise was that a NASA astronaut found a genie in a bottle(named 'Jeanie') and they fell in love, eventually marrying.  As with Bewitched, it was best to suspend your incredulity(she was incorporeal and thus not 'real' but who's counting...).
The show's narrow plot line had Tony, her hero and astronaut, trying to conceal her actual secret identity(i.e. as a genie).  That was it, period.  That they got so much mileage from it was a result of our less demanding public then and some good writing.  Once you got into the series and accepted the premise, some of the shows actually were very funny.  The best show, arguably, featured Barbara Eden's real-life husband as a paramour who romances her after her engagement to Tony.  The twist was that it was actually Jeanie's devious sister.  (A copy of 'Serena' from Bewitched as was the entire show, in a way, which was created as a result of the success of Bewitched.)
Be aware that the early shows were in black and white and really lacked the finish and feel of the later color episodes.  They are rarely shown in syndication as a result of that...",1409788800,3,1235,4.628440366972477

What do you expect for $22? I also don't understand people complaining about the packaging that holds the disks.

They did a nice job on it but as an armchair preservationist I wish we could leave things the way there were intended, it kind of leaves a bad taste in my mouth like when they used to take a movie like Ben Hur and would pan and scan it to make it fit on your screen, I just think coloring something that's b&w it kind of diminishes the quality but I know it was done to apiece today's viewer who can't stand not having color. The other thing is the packaging. I own Gilligan's Island as well and I know its a different intellectual property all together but they have great packaging. The seasons are packed in a jewel case with a middle section that holds every DVD and you can flip each section to find your DVD.

If stacking discs on spindles damaged them then all the recordable discs would be scratched because they all come on spindles if you buy twenty five or more. I have purchased hundreds of recordable discs on spindles and never got any that was scratched. Anyway back to the series, buy it if you just want to relax and have fun.

The picture and sound quality on the episodes originally filmed in black and white, but colorized for DVD release are outstanding, too. I am completely satisfied with the quality of the DVD's that I've watched. I've watched every episode of the first 3 seasons and I'm halfway through the fourth season, so, I believe, the entire set is an outstanding value. The show is more fun to watch now than it was originally in the 1960's. I highly recommend it to everyone.

2479648,5,B000E1E7UE,"I was born after this show's original run, and I actually only watched it for the first time on TV reruns, just a few years ago. I thought that even though it was over 40 years old, it is a really genuinely funny show. I actually did 'laugh out loud' many times while watching it. When I started watching it, I was afraid it would be a girly chick show, but it's not. Jeannie is a very funny, innocent, eager-to-please genie who definitely has a mischievous streak in her. And she can have a temper, too, if she is provoked, even against her master. And, of course, she's drop-dead gorgeous. That actually made me wonder about Major Nelson; what man in his right mind would push away a woman like that, who was throwing herself at him? At times I grew annoyed with Major Nelson because I thought he was too strict and cold with Jeannie.

The pacing of the show is very good, and it has good timing that makes it funnier. That's hard to explain, but if you watch it, you'll see what I mean. Of course, the 60's special effects are laughable now, but that's true of any older show. I can't believe the network made such a fuss over showing Barbara Eden's navel when certain other parts of her are just hanging out there in some scenes. Not that I minded that, of course. Bottom line, this is a genuinely funny show that holds up very well today, and well worth owning.",1406073600,,1366,4.3359375

2479665,3,B000E1E7UE,"The show is 5 stars, but the three stars is for the packaging. I did not get the bottle-shaped box but the illustrated box. Obviously Sony was trying to save money. All the DVDs are stacked on one spindle and held in place with a corrugated cardboard piece. Not very good packaging in my opinion, but at least you get the complete series for a low price. What I did is purchase a Unikeeper clamshell DVD case and immediately transferred all the DVDs into that. I wouldn't recommend storing the DVDs in the original box, because the flimsy cardboard piece will not hold the discs in place. Plus stacking them on top of each other is just asking for scratches.",1404000000,4,658,4.491666666666666

2479668,4,B000E1E7UE,"I have wanted this set on and off for a while now, just never made the motion to get it.  The colorization of season 1 left me cold and never paid it anymore attention.  Now with this new complete collection you get the entire series and one drawback,you get season one in colorized form only.  So, you will have to get the B&W season set on its own to be a purist.  I picked up the new Mill Creek Seasons 1-2 set in B&W for under $10. The prints look fine.  Many have complained about the one large stack spindle that all of the 20 DVDs are housed on inside the box.  Come one, you have the entire series for far less than it used to cost, and can you REALLY watch all 20 at the same time?  I take out 1-2 discs in order and watch those, then put them back on the bottom and take out the next 2 discs to watch in sequence.  This cuts down on package breakdown for the set.  I did this with Charlie's Angels Complete Series Box (same Spindle set up) and it make it easy.  Unless you watch the show for 12 hours solid as a marathon, you can take 1-3 discs out at a time and finish them before putting them away and swapping out for the next ones.  I prefer this type of packaging if I can get a reduced cost overall. I appreciate the savings and being able to have the whole thing in one case.  All the prints look great and for a guilty pleasure, I always liked the show.",1403136000,,1371,4.0

I was a little worried after reading the reviews about the Jeannie bottle it sometimes comes and how difficult it was to work with. The included tin works great. Two thumbs up.",1400716800,,439,4.0
2479679,4,B000E1E7UE,"I Dream of Jeannie is a really funny and entertaining show. I'm glad to add it to my collection.

From reading previous reviews, I believe the original packaging had the DVDs in an accordion style holder within a decorative ""Genie"" bottle. The new packaging is very basic with the DVDs stacked on a plastic spindle within a folding box/case. I find the DVDs very hard to remove from this spindle because they sit so tightly on the post that they tend to bend when trying to remove. I've found that spinning/twisting the DVD makes it come off okay but you still have to be very careful.

Anyway, I am giving this set 5 stars for the content and only 3 stars for the (new) packaging. I give it 2 stars for the closed-captioning...Since there are no English subtitles, you must use composite (yellow [video] & red/white [audio]) analog connections to receive the closed-caption stream. Unfortunately, the closed-caption stream does not pass through a HDMI cable. Newer series and movie releases usually include the (SDH) closed-captioning choice from the menu selections. In this case, this is where the CC stream is encoded within the video stream.

Overall, I would still recommend this set for anyone who enjoys Jeannie. And I really recommend this set for anyone who has not seen this series; I believe you will be hilariously surprised.",1400371200,7,1338,4.859649122807017

2479691,3,B000E1E7UE,"This review is for the I Dream Of Jeanie complete set.  The smaller version.  All the disks are placed on one spindle stacked one on top of the other.  When it first arrived I wasn't thrilled about the packaging.  I thought it was going to be a lot of trouble getting the disks out.  The disks are numbered differently than the Episode season list.  But if you can count,  then theres no problem really.  None of that matters much now.  After watching 2 and a half seasons,  I realized that getting the disks out again wouldnt really be that big of a deal.  Since every episode is the same it doesnt matter which disk you watch,  or which episode.  The acting  and the cast are wonderful.  When I was a kid, I never noticed how in one episode Jeanie was able to do some great magical thing and then later not be able (or not smart enough) to do even some simple thing.  Such as.  When Jeanie makes another Tony,  or more..  Which she did several times.  Yet in another episode,  Neither Jeanie,  nor  Tony,  (who was smart enough to be an astronaut)  could come up with the idea to replace Jeanies favorite slippers with a copy.  If you can copy a whole person,  wouldnt making slippers be a simple thing?  No one would have even noticed they were gone in the first place.  These things can be ridiculous if you watch too many episodes in a row.  I bought the complete set,  so the first season is colorized.  I know some don't approve of this.  I see nothing wrong with it, since the Black and White version still exists.  Yes, some of the colors were wrong.  Still, it is a lot better than others I have seen.  I don't regret buying this complete set.  It still has some great comedy, and worth the price for a complete set.  The show however seems different than it did when viewing it from a childs eyes.  Its not all I remembered it to be.  Maybe,  I dreamed it was better than this.",1399075200,,1888,4.28

Oh yes, there's a pre-boozed up Hagman, showing off his comedic talents, and a ready-for-game-show career Bill Daly. The best scene, IMHO, in the whole series is stolen by guest star Paul Lynde and Hayden Rorke. Those two have a scene in Dr. Bellow's office where Lynde, as a ""Horrible little tax man,"" grilles Rorke. I have to replay that scene every time I watch the episode.
It is a classic series because it is funny!
Look for Michael Ansara, late of Lost In Space, who was Eden's real life husband, and Don Rickles.
Lynde should have been a regular, as he stole so many scenes.",1383609600,6,656,4.429752066115703

That isn't the way it was made and shown on TV so why would we want it that way now? I will have to purchase the first season (again) separately if I actually want black and white instead of the crap colorization.  I also am not a fan of the way the DVDs are in the box.  Instead of being on individual sleeves like most multi sets they are stacked up on top of one another.  You have to remove each DVD to get to the one you want and them back again.

2479792,4,B000E1E7UE,"When I came across this Complete Series Box Set on Amazon, I was a fairly new member of the I Dream of Jeannie fan club. Just before I ordered this set, I had scarcely seen some reruns on TV and watched a few episodes online.

I Dream of Jeannie dropped onto the TV landscape on September 18, 1965 on NBC-TV. This outlandish fantasy-aimed situation comedy was created upon the success of Bewitched, a ABC fantasy, that debuted on September 17, 1964 and had already became the #2 series on TV. I Dream of Jeannie followed the story of a 2,000-year-old genie named Jeannie (Barbara Eden) and astronaut Tony Nelson (Larry Hagman), who meet on a deserted island after Tony's space shuttle crashes. There, he finds a bottle and accidentally lets a foreign-speaking Jeannie out of the bottle. Unbeknownst to Tony, when his rescue crew comes, Jeannie returns to her bottle and places it his bag. When he gets home, Tony discovers Jeannie and their zany misadventures begin. Throughout the rest of the series are Major Roger Healy (Bill Daily), Colonel Dr. Alfred Bellows (Hayden Rorke), and his wife Amanda Bellows (Emmaline Henry).

Although not as popular as Bewitched with audiences or critics, I Dream of Jeannie did have a great deal of controversy. Censors haunted production sets because of Barbara Eden's risqu two-piece Jeannie Costume. NBC also worried about the concept of the series: a Jeannie willing to do literally ""anything"" for her master. The series went on to have five moderately successful seasons, and from 1965 to 1970, the series was a critical mockery. In the fifth season, when NBC executives only renewed the series unless Jeannie and Tony were married, the show became stupid. Jeannie was unrealistic from the beginning... she was fake. She was a fantasy. How does someone like that get married? They don't. Season five was definitely not the best of the show.

As for the box set this series comes in, it looks okay. It's plastic. Mine was tore in some spots and replaced with some cheap tape. The bottle is really nice and looks good, but the DVD holder (20 DVDs) is flimsy and mine was torn on both ends. Also included is a nice box with logo cards (or trading cards or some sort) from all five seasons. They have nice little information and some rare pictures on them. For the price, this set is really not worth it. There is a re-boxing of the complete series coming out in just a few months and the going price is like $35. I'd say buy that. I have not seen any pictures of it yet, but it is supposed to better than this one, especially because all the complaints this one has gotten from fans. Not too satisfying. Wait for the new release.",1375574400,6,2667,4.670212765957447

You have to be careful when taking out DVD's as the sets themselves are packed cheaply. Many fans have complained about this issue which explains why Columbia is rereleasing this whole set again in October. Hopefully, the problem WILL be corrected so fans do not have to worry about getting their discs scratched.

 The only bonus features are the ones from the Season one set which included commentary from the show's stars on the pilot episode and new interviews with Barbara Eden, Larry Hagman and Bill Daily.

This item's been discontinued, however, so on October 15th Sony Pictures Home Entertainment will re-release I Dream of Jeannie - The Complete Series, in slimmer ""unlimited"" packaging that's more conventional in look (and shelf fit)...it will come with the same 20 DVDs which the previous set included, and with all the same on-disc content as well (extras and all, we're told, which means that it's the same Pilot Episode Audio Commentary and Cast Interviews found on the Season 1 set, since the 2nd through 5th season sets had no extras). Unfortunately it does NOT seem to include the two post-series telefilms (1985's ""I Dream of Jeannie: 15 Years Later,"" separately available as a MOD (manufacture on demand) DVD, and 1991's ""I Still Dream of Jeannie,"" which is still not available on DVD yet); it's just the 5 seasons that aired for the show's original broadcast.""",1373846400,7,1037,4.864406779661017

2479800,4,B000E1E7UE,"The show is well written, produced, and directed . The cast has a sparkling chemistry throughout the series. The first year although it has a few inconsistencies in story line continuity is my favorite. The characters are more down to earth and the romance is there. The colorization is seamless. The second year saw the show becoming formularized and departing farther from the confines of a believable reality within its fictional reality. Aside from that each show makes me laugh. It is very similar to the three stooges in that each time you watch the shows, they become funnier knowing what is going to happen and how the characters will react. I just pop in a disk when I want to get away from the seriousness of the day. The show deserves 5 stars but it loses one because of the cheap packaging. It is clever but the cardboard shape of the bottle to hold the disks came apart as soon as I removed it from the plastic case. A little thicker cardboard and some more glue or slot fitted cardboard design would have made this not only a clever design but lasting trophy to display wherever viewing monitors are watched. When I'm done the whole series, I'll have to see if the original black and white season is available and watch that to see what kind of a different mood is created.

I have already chunked the cardboard lamp and plan on getting an inexpensive binder from Target to store the twenty discs because this is a treasure I want to enjoy for years to come. The transfers are amazing for being as old of TV show this is. Sony did us fans justice by doing such a great job at the transfers (even the early B&W episodes are now looking stunning in color!).

2479822,4,B000E1E7UE,"Watched this as a kid in my grandparent's house. I don't remember any specific episodes, but I remember the opening well.

The series made leaps and bounds as it advanced. Early on, sets end or the painted backdrops are a bit too painted, but throw in trips to Hawaii and actual footage of various Air Force and NASA instillations definitely improves things. Several musical and other entertainment guest stars appear, which was a surprise. Fun to see the era in this show.

As for the seasons overall, there are some moments where I just hate Roger for trying to steal Jeannie, but he's forgivable in the end. The episodes and seasons progress well. Early on the episodes seem more interested in connecting and really playing on being discovered. This occasionally resurfaces, but the series has crazy fun. Becoming a rodeo, piano, and every other kind of virtuoso only for the episode appears a lot.

I wish there were chapter skips within the episodes to skip the opening song (though, I watched it plenty of times). Not enough series do this. No big deal. My only real disappointment with the series itself is that there is no real end. You watch the last episode of the season, and it doesn't wrap up anything. This is odd considering that the last season does include an episode that seems to do just that--and ends up being a dream sequence. Huh.

Other than this, everyone's disappointment over the packaging is about right. I never keep such things so I didn't mind this.

2479839,4,B000E1E7UE,"I started watching I DREAM OF JEANNIE in re-runs with my sister about 10 years ago, and immediately liked the series. SInce I love and cherish history and pop culture of yesteryear, I took it upon myself to get as many of my favorite series as possible on DVD to share with my own family in the future; I DREAM OF JEANNIE is one of those series.
I originally bought the first season by itself (because it was available in black and white, and I had heard bad things about the color copy - plus, I wanted to see it on DVD as it had originally been aired, in black and white), followed by the complete series, and I had read mixed reviews about the complete series set's packaging.
Today, I recieved my copy of the complete series of I DREAM OF JEANNIE: the season-by-season fun facts cards were an added bonus I enjoyed reading, and the packaging was very cute - but it was a NIGHTMARE! I felt as if I were doing an art project for school, something I haven't done in a few years. Fold this here, fold this there - it took about 15 minutes to figure it out, and then I had to get rubber bands to hold the genie bottle's neck part of the packaging together, since the glue had come undone. I ended up throwing away the rest of the packaging (the clear boxes - one for the flash cards, one for the whole set, one for the bottle cap - and the bottle cap itself), and the hunkily-assembled (my dad's word, not mine) complete-series-in-a-bottle is standing on my bookshelf amid my DVDs, looking more like an over-sized nick-nack than a DVD collection.
Now I wish I had bought the individual seasons instead. (Pun intended.
This just seemed less expensive and less time-consuming, considering how fast these shows are being taken of the air in re-runs.)",1350345600,,1746,4.408668730650155

The packaging is  beautiful and eye-catching, although, like others have said, it is poorly designed and is quite flimsy.

2479859,4,B000E1E7UE,"Be aware that this contains the COLORIZED version of the first season. The colorization is done excellently, but to purists it is unwanted. In all honesty, I forgot that the 1st season was in B&W and failed to check that when ordering; I would have preferred the B&W first season. On the other hand, if ever a series originally filmed in B&W deserved colorizing, this is probably it.

OK, as for an actual review... the title pretty much sums it up.

I loved this series growing up, and I'm happy to have it in my collection.

The transfers for the first season, anyway (all I've had time to watch), are excellent and look great on my 52"" LCD using my up-sampling DVD player.

The packaging at first glance is impressive, cute, and in keeping with the tone of the series. In that regard, it's excellent. As a practical way to safely store the DVDs, it leaves much to be desired. The packaging consists of a cardboard ""genie bottle"", which is rectangular in cross-section. The DVDs are in a plastic keeper device which is just basically sleeves hinge-joined along one edge (which allows the disks themselves to slip right out) which sits inside the ""bottle"" base. The sides of the bottle are completely open, and the set of disks can -- and do -- fall right out. You can't actually carry the disks inside the bottle, the bottle is entirely for show. The first thing I did upon opening the package and pulling the bottle out was to have the pack of disks fall to the floor. The first time I went to take the bottle off the shelf, even forewarned, I dumped the disks again and caught them on their way down. Thankfully, no damage was done either time. It would have been way better, I think, if the disks were in a closable box and/or if there was a way to keep them from just sliding out of the bottle-box so easily.",1252886400,17,1814,4.438438438438438

2479862,3,B000E1E7UE,"The episodes are great & I want to make it clear that I love this series. I have no complaints with the episodes or the quality of the episodes.

The problem is with the functionality of the nightmare packaging, the DVD indexing, the ear-blasting irritating audio on the Menu and inconsistent labeling vs menu designations. I recommend you read this before buying this cute set. You might change your mind and get a set with normal packaging after you read about the nightmare you will go through just to watch the DVD's.

The packaging is cute... if you don't ever plan to watch the episodes. However, if you do plan to watch them, when you remove the disk sleeves from the bottle, do NOT set it down because you will end up with disks everywhere. The sleeves cannot be set down because they cannot support themselves upright without the bottle... so it flops over and the disks all fall out. The sleeves are an open accordion/slinky style design, made from thin cardboard. This design is a real pain in the wazoo if you are trying to take out the disks to place them into a DVD player. Since you can't set it down... you have to hold the packaging in one hand while loading the disks into the player with the other hand.

Also, the cardboard bottle is very tall, so you need a minimum clearance of 18 inches of height to set down the bottle on the card box as it was designed... so if you have shorter shelf height, it won't fit.

The disk labels are all numbered sequentially 1-20. It does show you the season on the label and the sleeves are color coded to separate seasons... but here is the problem. When you load the disks, once you get to disk #5... it is actually season 2 disk #1... so instead of seeing Disk 5 on the menu... you see Disk #1 on the menu. Talk about mismatched numbering schemes between the disk labels and disk screen menu... Really confusing if you have a 5 disk DVD player and see it change from disk 4 to disk 1 (when you were expecting disk 5 like the label).

Now that your DVD is loaded... you'd better turn down your sound because you are going to be blasted out of your seat by the opening music volume which is 50 times louder than the episodes. Then when you hear the menu audio music, it plays only a few notes from the theme song then it is abruptly cut off by the loud bang of a snare drum. It does this over and over and over until you stop it. It is really irritating. Especially if the episodes have finished playing and the screen reverts to this menu where you hear a dozen or so notes of the theme song followed by that irritating snare drum bang... over and over again until you put it out of its misery.

Now we come to the indexing problem. The entire 1st season's indexing is screwed up... which means you can't skip past the opening credits and theme song on each episode unless you fast forward. If you try to skip to the next scene to bypass the opening theme, you will miss a big chunk of the episode. This is really a nuisance having to fast forward through the theme on every single episode of the entire first season. Evidently, it does not occur to the ""lack of brains"" crew which handled the DVD indexing... that we may not want to watch the opening theme 30 times in a row. The second season seems to be working ok... but we'll see how that goes. I've seen other series like ST-TNG where it goes back and forth from one season to the next. No consistency. By the time I got to disk #5, I was thoroughly irritated enough to write this review while it was all fresh in my mind.

Now we come to the little box of cards which the cardboard bottle sits atop. It is like a deck of playing cards for the episodes and only has a short sentence of description about each episode and none about the actors. The same amount of info you will find on Wikipedia. The font is about a 6... so if you are over the age of 40 (which all of the original fans are) you will not be able to read these without some kind of magnification or bifocals. Obviously designed by someone under the age of 30. The cards are cute but totally nonfunctional if you are truly wanting to look for info on the episodes.

The colorizing of the B&W episodes is not as good as on Bewitched, but tolerable. This was done by a lazy (or cheap) colorizer who didn't get inside the mouths and put way too much yellow in her hair. It was almost orange. This was also done by someone under the age of 40 (or someone in a foreign country) who had no clue as to what colors the phones, furnishings, decor, appliances and wall & floor treatments were available in the 60's. All they had to do was to watch a couple of the episodes which were filmed in color... to get the correct colors before they began the colorizing process. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out.

This might be nitpicking... but things like Orange phones jump out at those of us who lived in the 60's We all know that they didn't have Orange phones in the 60's. Most of the standard phones were either black, white and olive green with some exceptions on the princess and wall phone lines which could be found in baby blue and yellow. The first orange phone I remember wasn't available until around 1980 when they made an Orange overlay template (for either OSU or OU football team colors) for one of the touchtone phone styles.

So, if you are buying this set as a cute collectible... it is an adorable design. But if you are planning to watch all of the episodes... this set will be a real pain in the wazoo.",1248912000,433,5507,4.286538461538462
2479863,4,B000E1E7UE,"Just got complete series, read reviews & customers that wrote reviews are so right about the 'cardboard' bottle containing the DVD's, it will not last long, cardboard will eventually bend & won't look  the same. Seems like company wanted to save money by using cardboard. They should definitely redo the bottle, make it out of plastic, similar to the cases one buys with movies & replace at no extra charge to customers who have already bought the series thru Amazon. One shouldn't have to use plastic box it came in, bottle should look good displayed by itself. I had to place it back in plastic box it came in, also keeps dust getting in discs & eventually dust sticking to any disc can ruin it probably. The 'I Love Lucy' complete series did a much better job, even tho it is made of cardboard, it's pretty sturdy & well packaged where the discs are secure. It comes in a plastic see thru box like the 'I Dream of Jeannie', BUT, discs are inside the sturdy & thick cardboard base box & lid has a big red heart & a piece of thick cardboard between front & back hearts which is the lid to cover discs, it really keeps dust out of discs. A bit of cardboard at very bottom sticks out on sides where the box sits well. The bottle does not cover the discs unless placed inside the plastic box it came inside of, so one can expect dust to get in. Guess company who made this bottle didn't care to do an excellent job to make the bottle better & secure discs. It's still a very good price for the set, just keeping it inside plastic box & my main concern are the discs. It would be nice to keep bottle outside plastic see thru box to get discs from, but will just take out of clear box when I want to watch one of them.

My only deception with this collection is the ""bottle"".  I own over 500 DVD's at home and this is THE single most hazardous box to hold a collection of DVD's.

Each DVD is inserted in a sleeve and all these sleeves are glued together in an ""accordeon"" type of holder.  I use term ""glued"" very loosely:  1 tiny drop of glue at the top of the sleeve and another tiny one at the bottom.

Then you slip this ""accordeon"" sideways ""inside"" the ""bottle"".  If you try to lift the bottle by its ""neck"", chances are all your DVD's will slip to the floor faster than Jeannie could blink!...

Even getting a DVD out of this ""accordeon"" is hazardous; picture 20 DVD's held in a barely glued cardboard Slinky and you will have a pretty accurate idea!!!

2479877,4,B000E1E7UE,The series are wonderful with good quality DVD's. The only downfall with the set is that the DVD's are not secure enough and can fall out. That is the only reason I gave it a 4 star.,1231718400,51,182,3.945945945945946
2479878,5,B000E1E7UE,"Nice to have the episodes together in one place, not one year at a time.  I was disappointed that the reunion TV movie wasn't included.",1229212800,5,135,4.4
2479879,5,B000E1E7UE,This comes in the cutest container that looks like genie's bottle! it's like a decoration as well as the dvd's,1229040000,,110,4.55
2479880,1,B000E1E7UE,"TV show of ""I Dream of Jeannie"" was great and it still is one of my favorite TV series of all time, but I am very deeply disappointed that there is no English subtitle nor closed caption neither.  How couldn't video company neglect our educational needs such as English subtitle?  We suggest you to avoid this product for two major reasons: 1) no English subtitle/no closed caption and 2) there is no list of episodes in this product - that made me difficult to find which episodes and so, I had to look on DVD plate info.  There was no real Jeannie bottle in this product which it said ""Jeannie bottle included"" and it turned out to a pink cardboard bottle of Jeannie bottle - a gimmick.",1228521600,21,688,4.4015748031496065
2479881,3,B000E1E7UE,"BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU OPEN THIS. THE DVDs ARE NOT SUPPORTED WELL ENOUGH IN THE BODY OF THE JEANNIE BOTTLE. MINE TUMBLED OUT, HIT THE FLOOR AND WELL ... WILL NEVER BE THE SAME. EACH DVD IS HELD IN ITS OWN SLEEVE; ALL THE SLEEVES ARE GLUED TOGETHER IN AN ACCORDION-LIKE FASHION. THE DVDs ARE TOO HEAVY SO THAT'S WHY THE SLEEVES BROKE APART FROM ONE ANOTHER AND THE ENTIRE SET FELL OUT.  THE CONCEPT IS AWESOME. THE FINAL PRODUCT, NEEDS SOME WORK. I'M NOT ENTIRELY DISAPPOINTED THOUGH. THE PRICE I PAID IS LESS THAN BUYING THE SERIES SEPARATELY. A TRUE ""I DREAM A JEANNIE"" FAN TO THE END.",1227398400,16,588,4.345454545454546

2479883,1,B000E1E7UE,"Any true fan of ""I Dream of Jeannie"" already has all of these episodes as they were released over the years.  Seems like simply another way to milk this series one last time for every penny that can possibly be made.  Who cares if it comes with a cardboard bottle?",1226966400,10,264,4.26
2479884,4,B000E1E7UE,"I received mine the other day.  The packaging is pretty nice.  It has a clear plastic outer box with nice graphics.  The discs are beautiful with high quality labeling and are also color coded by season. The video and audio quality is very good to excellent.  The discs are kept in a colorful, fan-out style holder.  The set also comes with 55 trivia cards packed in a nice, little fancy box.  I have just a few issues, some little, some not so little.  First, the 'bottle'.  It's touted as a 'replica' but it's made of cardboard and only looks like the actual bottle from an image seen when turned to the side.  A more realistic solid bottle would have been very cool even if made of only plastic.  They could have put the discs and holder lying flat in the base and had the base removable.  I know I'm going on but that's the way I would have done it.  I doubt it would have cost them much more.  Also, the discs are numbered 1 thru 20.  It probably would have been better to group the disc numbers by season.  For example, the first disc of Season 2 says 'Season 2, Disc 5' which was a bit confusing at first.  Another thing. . there is no episode guide included with this set.  That's a big miss as it makes it very difficult to know what disc has which episodes. Lastly, as some already know, the first season is the colorized version which may disappoint the purists.  Despite the negs, it's worth it as you're getting a high quality DVD set of the whole series for a little over $100.  And I'm glad I waited instead of buying the single season sets.",1226880000,140,1556,4.285223367697594
