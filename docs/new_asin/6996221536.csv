1115277,5,6996221536,"Hello,

So I saw that the Scrubs DVD Collection was on sale and since I always wanted to have it, plus all the speacial features, I decided to buy it. I choose the option of a Expedited International Shipping which should have taken about 3-4 weeks but it arrived slightly over a week, so the shiping gets 5 stars from me. (Also it arrived in perfect condition.)

I unpacked it and tried to play it on my DVD player and also on my Divx Player but it said that the DVD has the wrong region settings. (Very important to people like me who aren't DVD savy....region is very important because not all players will play the disc.) These DVD's are region 1 by the way! Although I would have liked a warning about this in the product description I probably should have checked it before I bought the DVDs. Nevertheless, I was still able to play the DVDs on my computer.

I so far have watched Seasons 1-5 and I haven't encountered any problems (besides the obvious mentioned before :P). The discs don't skip the sound is dolby digital (a.k.a. very good). There are also a lot of special features on each DVD. I made a short video review of Season 1 that you can find here:

1115278,4,6996221536,"Scrubs was a great series, funny and touching at the same time.  The first 7 seasons are almost as good as any on TV.  One of the few shows that can make you laugh and cry in one eipisode.  Never got the respect it should have, don't know why.  The eight season showed a terrible decline in just about all areas, not really funny, tries to be touching but came off heavy handed when it does, it seems 2-3 characters were off every episode (to save money or had they given up?).

But buy it for the first 7 seasons, watch the 8th for the few gems and do what you wish for season nine.  They should have a TV-law, you can't keep the name when everything about the series changes as the did in season 9.",1275350400,2,700,4.072992700729927
1115279,5,6996221536,"What can I say... SCRUBS is hysterical. Not sure how I missed it in prime time (Oh, yeah... college) but I am making up for it now. I love this series.",1274400000,,151,3.903225806451613
1115280,5,6996221536,"Even I, who loves the show, have had a hard time keeping up with time changes, night changes and network changes that have plagued this show seemingly since its inception. But now I am saved! I have hummed and hawed for a long time about whether or not to justify the expense of $20 - $30 a season to round out my collection which ends with season three. Then Amazon threw this on a daily deal and I finally couldn't say no. I bought it. I got it. And I love it. What separates this show from the rest is the strong, big ensemble cast and the implementation of wonderful music and the show's profound (sometimes) moral lending. This show hits you with great writing, acting, story lines, and character development and truly shouldn't be missed. If you're on the fence about buying the whole shebang, then get season one. The series is fairly consistent after that. But never, ever, dull.",1273795200,4,887,4.515527950310559
1115281,5,6996221536,"First off, this is not the boxed set.  The product you will receive is the same as if you order each of the seasons individually.  Someone has posted a photo of the set (as of 5/10/10)on this page, and this is not it.

That said, this is everything a Scrubs fan is looking for.  If you're like me and you neglected to buy any of the seasons as the show aired (but love it), then here's an easy place to get them all at the same time.  When I bought this set, Amazon had it on sale for $89.99.  My guess is that it'll be priced there again.

With other series, I've seen various complaints posted by customers (people keep writing about all of the commercials in the Frasier set that apparently can't be skipped, that the Friends set has cheap packaging that scratches the dvds, etc.), but I can safely say that with this set I have none.  If you want it, buy it.  You're getting exactly what you order.",1273449600,9,902,4.228070175438597
1115282,5,6996221536,Great show! Nice that 8 seasons are compacted into a little box and doesn't take up much room.,1267056000,,94,4.277777777777778
1115283,4,6996221536,"I'm into season three of the eight season box set.  Video and audio are both good.
It caught me by surprise that the printed info on the back of the box refers to a single season of the series; it doesn't address all eight seasons.  This, plus the flimsy inside packaging, suggest that this is an unauthorized copy of the series.  While the advertising doesn't mention this, it isn't quite what I thought I was getting, but all in all, the video transfer has been great and I've encountered no problem so far.",1265155200,,509,4.451612903225806
1115284,1,6996221536,"I bought this version of this item off of eBay for $70 + $20 shipping (from Canada).  Seller had 100% feedback, so I thought I was safe.

This was to be a Christmas present for my son.  When I got it yesterday and saw ""China Record Co."" on the shrink wrap, my heart just sank; I knew I had to check it out, so I ended up opening it.  As the other reviewer said, seasons 1-6 are authentic and fine.  However, seasons 7 and 8 are, as the other reviewer said, just copies off TV -- Channel 4 in New York, to be exact.  Unfortunately, I hadn't seen this review before making my purchase.

The beginning montage and (authentic) menu selections are missing from both seasons 7-8; instead, only the episodes appearing on the discs are displayed.  Different ""messages"" appear onscreen while viewing the episodes: NBC logo (season 7), ABC logo (season 8), Channel 4 New York logo, upcoming show ads, rating, etc, some of which is displayed continuously throughout the show -- very obvious that the shows were just taped off of network TV.

For season 8, you automatically get English subtitles which you have to manually turn off per episode.  A nuisance, but I can live with it.

However, for season 7, there is no option of turning off the subtitles; your choices are English, Chinese, and Simplified (which is apparently another version of Chinese).  So now, not only do you have the subtitles taking up the bottom quarter of the screen, but they're also overwriting the NBC logo and ads, so all you have is a jumbled mess.  VERY annoying.

As the other reviewer said, the packaging is also subpar.  The outside box is nice and appears high-quality, but when you open it, all 8 seasons are just sitting in plastic sleeves. (The box opens like a cigar box.)  We put all our discs in books so that's not that big of a deal to me, but since this was to be a present, it would've been nice if the seasons had been packaged in their individual cases like is normally done -- that way, every time my son started a new season, it'd be a little reminder of Christmas.

One other thing -- with some of the discs (not all) from seasons 7 and 8, there was a whirring sound coming out of my DVD player; the discs from seasons 1-6 (that I tried) seemed okay.

I couldn't decide what to rate this item.  I finally decided on 1 star because I'm now wondering if seasons 1-6, though they seem authentic, are just bootleg copies.",1257292800,8,2406,4.439635535307517
1115285,4,6996221536,"Seasons 1-6 were complete and authentic but season 7 and 8 were high-quality copies off of television. Plus the container and overall packaging and presentation were a little shoddy. Personally, I am happy with it since all I really wanted was copies of all the episodes but if you're into packaging and presentation, I wouldn't suggest this item.",1254009600,,347,5.0

7899848,5,6996221536,"I got it for $20 and it has all of the episodes, the case is in great shape, and nothing weird has been going on so far. I read the other reviews that said they couldn't turn off the captions, or that there was weird Chinese stuff running across the bottom, I've only watched random episodes, but so far the most I've had is a Baby Mama promo on the bottom of the screen for like 5 seconds in season 7. One of the reviewers said seasons 7 & 8 are Chinese rip-offs, that might be true, but I can't tell besides the Baby Mama thing. In fact, I might prefer that because they would use the right songs-from TV- not the ones that show up on real DVDs and Netflix. I did notice one small scene was cut out of an episode, but I'm not sure if that is normally cut during when on TV-I've noticed similar things when watching The Office on TV vs a legitimate DVD. But point is, it's cheap, so even if an entire season is missing, it's still way cheaper to buy that one season than to buy them all separately (I had been considering doing that for months!) This is probably the happiest I've ever been with an Amazon purchase, I was expecting something crappy and was very pleasantly surprised to find that I have every Scrubs episode (besides the lamesauce season 9) and I only had to pay $20 and shipping!

7899851,5,6996221536,"If you're reading this review maybe you're getting this as a gift for someone so you haven't seen the show.  It's a show for adults as there is some mild sexual content in most episodes.  I would call it family appropriate however because there isn't obscene language or nudity, but more euphemisms and double meanings.  It's a clever show with a wacky side and some poignant social commentary thrown in.  This is not a medical drama although there are dramatic moments.  Every side character is compelling and entertaining to watch.

For me it's the ultimate pick me up show if I'm bored or stressed and need something to take my mind off life.",1300233600,,645,4.663716814159292
7899852,5,6996221536,"This set wasn't cheap but I decided to order myself the entire Scrubs eight seasons for a Christmas present. It came fast, in perfect condition, freshly wrapped from the factory, and no glitches.  The show just grabbed me - I'm an adult, female - but somehow am drawn to this collection of driven and dedicated characters; all except two: the janitor and Ted the lawyer.  Those two never got beyond 2-dimension to me, even though they were given girlfriends at the end, but all the others, especially the big five (J.D., Elliot, Turk, Carla & Perry) plus Jordan and Dr. Kelso -- all came through solidly with both warts and heart.  There are so many quotable lines, I am on my second watching to get them in my head for good.  The flashbacks are a brilliant touch in this show -- you see enormous set-ups for a 5-second payoff in Zach's imagination playing out for us to see.

The audio commentaries are fair, but add to the appreciation of what was going on with the actors.  Bill Lawrence spends a good bit of time groaning about his mistakes, which I certainly don't see.  You learn that they actually got to inhabit an empty hospital building, fallen on hard economic times -- so the backdrops are all accurate.  It's cute to see how many of them say they had no idea what the medical terminology meant as they were saying it.  But it works.  It really works like Mash worked, because they inject serious issues along with the sophomoric humor, immaturity, character flaws, etc.  The show is quite deep - considering they touch on race, death, authority, and sex (well everyone touches on sex).",1295222400,,1598,4.6113074204946995
7899853,4,6996221536,"This is a great price on eight full seasons of this outstanding show.

Positives: Each season has an individual case, which I like.  The video quality is good.  The episodes seem to include a fair amount of scenes that were cut in syndication.  And there are a lot of good bonus features on every disc.

Negatives: They don't include any kind of booklet or episode guide, so you have to scroll through to see the episode titles.  And there's no description of the episodes, so if you're looking for a certain one without the title, you're out of luck.  I find that fairly annoying, and worth a one star reduction for the set.  Also, each case is enclosed in its own box/slipcase, which has exactly the same graphics as the case itself.  Seems odd, and they could have done a big box to put them all into together at less expense.  That's admittedly a minor quibble, though.",1286928000,2,873,4.503184713375796
