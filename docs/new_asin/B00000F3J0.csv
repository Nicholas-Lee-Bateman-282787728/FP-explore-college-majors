8360883,5,B00000F3J0,"Read by Orson Welles set against the artwork of Gustave Dore. This project, led by Lawrence Jordan, has Welles' reading accompanied by a haunting little soundtrack which complements the bizarre color overlay illustrations on Dore's pieces.

Some of these overlay illustrations are unnecessary, but the attempt to give the illustrations the sense of movement is achieved and justifies its existence as more than just an audio-recorded reading.

It would be wonderful to see this on DVD.",1348272000,,485,5.368421052631579
