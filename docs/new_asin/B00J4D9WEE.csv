6333228,5,B00J4D9WEE,"Excellent movie for both golf-lovers and those who enjoy a good documentary about life, people, challenges, family dynamics, and the similarities and differences of children from around the world!",1405036800,2,196,5.793103448275862
6333229,5,B00J4D9WEE,"This movie is awesome for ALL ages.  It is also a great movie to watch as a family.  Anyone can relate to it if your child plays sports, not necessarily just a golf movie.  It is very inspiring for my children too, to see these 7 years olds put in the time and dedication (along with their parents) to be one of the best in their age group.  For the parents, I think you can find yourself in any one of the parents featured and learn something from watching other parents with children in a sport.

I have a 6 year old daughter and 7 year old son and they both LOVE this movie.  They say it is their favorite movie to watch.  I would much rather have them watching a real life documentary about the ups and downs of a sport as to a cartoon or animated movie.  My daughter says that she wants to by just like one of the girls in the movie.  From watching this movie over and over I can quickly point out to her how many long hours, days, weeks these kids put into perfecting the game of golf.  It is truly inspiring!

I cannot say enough about this movie, you will not regret the purchase!",1404864000,5,1088,4.084905660377358

8648015,1,B00J4D9WEE,"Does the film maker not play golf? Literally, the winning putts where not actually shown.  The first 60min was incredibly slow.  As mentioned, the tournament was edited in a way that you could track the shots.  What a joke.",1472256000,,223,4.666666666666667
8648016,4,B00J4D9WEE,Chronicles the run-up to a group of children from around the world as they prepare to play in a children's golf championship. At times insightful and other times it feels like the moms and dads are helicopter parents. One explains that golf is the only way he as a worker can get his child into college. (?) One parent get so mad they swear. Colorful.,1466985600,,351,4.415384615384616
