After watching this and plus done some research of this, I was never dissappointed. The collaboration between the great Freddie Hubbard and composer/arranger/conductor Allyn Ferguson all wanted the best creating this album and made it something happen.

Good commentary, remarkable sounds and energy coming the sidemen and the strings section. Still the best. This rare documentary has fully been long out-of-print and hopefully someone can get it re-released on DVD.

Thankfully we forever share the greatest legacy of the late Freddie Hubbard has left us and continue to last for generations to come.",1309824000,,848,6.239316239316239
