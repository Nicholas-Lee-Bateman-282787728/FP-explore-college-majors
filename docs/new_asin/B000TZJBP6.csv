2912173,5,B000TZJBP6,"In the movie Knocked Up, Katherine Heigl plays Alison Scott, a twenty-something career gal who has just been promoted to an on-air position with E! Entertainment Television. The day she receives her promotion Alison goes out to celebrate with her older sister, Debbie, at a nightclub. It's there that she meets Ben, an unmotivated pothead who lives with four roommates and doesn't have a job ""per se."" Ben and his roommates are working on creating a Web site that will allow you to search for your favorite actress's nude scenes. When Ben and Allison meet, even though she's gorgeous and he's a pudgy, hairy mess, there's something about his personality and charm that wins her over. Eventually they wind up back at her place and you can guess from the title what happens next.

Knocked Up is the story of the way that Alison and Ben have to navigate an unplanned pregnancy and what it will mean for their individual futures, the future of their unborn child, and their collective relationship. It goes over every aspect of an unplanned pregnancy: do we or don't we have it?, what's going to happen to my career?, is this the right person for me? All of these questions are tackled in an honest and humorous fashion. And, even if you aren't into it for the pregnancy angle, there's so much more to the movie. Alison's sister has been married with children for a few years and feels that her relationship is stagnating. Her husband, played by Paul Rudd, is in no such rut and instead manages to be completely oblivious to his wife's concerns. Ben's roommates, also unmotivated potheads, have to figure out what to do if their planned celebrity sex scene Web site doesn't pan out the way they'd planned. As a whole, Knocked Up was just an all around interesting and multifaceted romantic comedy. And it doesn't hurt that the movie was downright hilarious.

Knocked Up is the sort of movie you can see with a friend, family member, or significant other and everyone will have something to laugh about. I can't remember the last time I was at a movie where every seat was filled and everyone laughed pretty much the whole time. It's definitely going to top the list of one of the funniest movies of the summer.",1180656000,9,2206,4.668380462724936
2912174,4,B000TZJBP6,"This movie was very funny.  Created and directed by the team that brought us 40 year old virgin, this movie brings a guy who has poor luck with the ladies together with a gal who is above his expectations.  Together with a little alcohol and some disinhibition, the two are thrown together on a 9 month journey of unknown territory.  If you like nerd humor and stoner jokes, along with very funny situations, this is the movie for you.  If you are a fan of 40 year old virgin, again, very funny.  Check this out, you will like it, more so than what some critics have said.",1180656000,2,572,4.308411214953271
2912175,5,B000TZJBP6,"I had the pleasure of seeing this movie in a special advance screening on May 29, 2007.  Compared to The 40-Year-Old Virgin, the previous movie from the same director, this movie goes over the top and leaves you laughing through the entire two (plus) hours.  Everything is explicit, from the language to the visuals to the subject matter.  Be prepared to be emabarassed, while laughing all the way.

The actors and actresses in this movie are some of the greatest stars on TV and in movies today.  Many were drawn from The 40-Year-Old Virgin, The Office, and Saturday Night Live.

If you liked The 40-Year-Old Virgin, in particular the type of humor and situations in it, you'll love Knocked Up.

Bottom line: It's crude and explicit, but this is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a LONG time.",1180483200,3,799,4.664285714285715

2912273,2,B000TZJBP6,"Katherine Heigl has received some criticism of late, but based on this film - she has a very engaging charm, star presence; and her likability - at least on celluloid, is on par with Julia Roberts.

I wished the film had remained focus on Allison Scott/Katherine Heigl and Ben Stone/Seth Rogan.  I know we were supposed to be sympathetic of her sister, Debbie/Leslie Mann and her troubled marriage with Pete/Paul Rudd, but Debbie came off difficult and impossible to live with, and her reasoning was so flawed, I understood why Pete constantly wanted escape.  I couldn't fathom why anyone would actually want to be with her.  There was a single second where I felt sympathetic.  She was whiny and complaining, and she found fault when there was no reason to criticize, and her feelings were paper thin.

The cameos were delightful, and I liked how funny the E! producers were.  Ryan Seacrest comes off as a perfect douche.  I like that the producers were telling Allison (not telling Allison) to lose weight, wanting her to ""tighten.""  Katherine Heigl carried this film.  She is immensely appealing, and I was caught up with her charisma.  This film had flaws, but it was engaging because she was so engaging.

Seth Rogan comes off as sincere but he is bumbling and awkward, still a young man child.  You feel for Allison.  She makes a good living, but she is terrified, unknowing, and afraid.  She is trying, and you understand her tears.  Will they work?  Who knows?  But Allison will do her best.",1436659200,,1499,4.744186046511628

2912279,1,B000TZJBP6,"In this steaming pant-load of a movie, women are educated and successful, while men are all shiftless bums whose only goal in life is to smoke as much weed as possible.  And spoiler alert, the main character ""rises to the occasion"" by the end and will of course settle down and become an award-winning father, despite giving exactly the opposite impression through the rest of the film.  The ""controversial"" possibility of abortion is brought up by one character, but the writers decided that the word ""abortion"" was too horrible to utter aloud (like Voldemort's name in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter/dp/0545044251/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter</a>), so he says ""shmashmorshion"" instead.  It's not possible to have an informed, adult debate if one side can't even refer to the procedure by its name.

Recommended only for fans of Seth Rogan or Katherine Heigl who just can't get enough of seeing either of those two on the big screen, or anyone with a demented fetish for seeing an unattractive loser ""make it"" with a hot blonde.

BUT, it is also highly likely that as soon as the woman learned she was pregnant with his child, she would immediately get an abortion, not immediately want to find and talk to the father.  Seriously, what American woman these days, is going to want to sit down and talk to the father of her fetus, due to a drunken mistake, rather than proceed to the nearest abortion clinic and flush it out?

2912339,2,B000TZJBP6,"I loved Seth Rogen in ""Zach and Miri make a Porno,"" excellent comedy.  I then heard great reviews on Knocked Up as a comedy and even a few friends recommended it as such, so I had to get it.  Big disappointment.  Maybe if you are a parent and can relate to the film, perhaps, but I never found anything in it that stood out as humorous.  They smoke a lot of pot in the movie but Seth movies tend to do that anyhow.",1407024000,,414,3.9518072289156625

2912346,5,B000TZJBP6,"Straight-laced, professional newscaster Alison Scott, played by Katherine Heigl, and lazy, laid back pothead Ben Stone, played by Seth Rogen, meet at a club and have a one-night-stand.  Their plans to never see each other again afterwards are foiled when Alison ends up pregnant.  From there, a hilarious sequence of hijinks ensues as the couple deals with the situation and tries to adjust to the soon-to-be new addition in their lives.  My favorite scenes were the infamous ""fetch"" scene (I won't say more), when Ben viciously threatened Alison's doctor over the phone, and when Ben threatened Allison's sister, Debbie, played by Leslie Mann, at the hospital...sure, the man does a lot of threatening, but it's just so funny.  By the way, why do Leslie Mann and her husband, the film's director, Judd Apatow, always cast their own kids as Mann's characters' children?  Well, whatever the reason, this film has plenty of laughs and a solid plot to place them on.  The characters had genuine story arks and the dialogue was very natural.  Sure, the very last scene was a bit corny, but it worked.  As far as comedies go, this should be a case study.  Enjoy.",1403395200,,1157,4.862244897959184
2912347,3,B000TZJBP6,"As a social satirist or commentator, Apatow relies too heavily on blunt cliches. There's little here that is subtle, charming or clever. The story moves, so it's not exactly boring, but at the same time, not particularly engaging either.",1403222400,,237,5.102564102564102
2912348,2,B000TZJBP6,I didn't find it funny. No chemistry between the characters. This movie fell flat. Maybe people who were in a similar situation like this might find it funny or connect with the story. Maybe the younger generation will like this but I don't think anyone 30 or over will care for it. They don't make comedy movies like they used too.,1402963200,,332,4.459016393442623

2912350,3,B000TZJBP6,"Wow, the sister character in this movie, the mother of two pre-schoolers, could out-swear a sailor.  It wasn't funny, just annoying and slightly offensive.  The ending, where the character's put aside a lot of selfish adolescent behaviors and finally grow up, is the best part.",1398384000,,277,5.133333333333334

2912355,4,B000TZJBP6,"My husband and I really like this movie and were excited to purchase the ""unrated and unprotected"" version to see the extras.  The extras don't disappoint, the only problem is the DVD was the full-screen version.  I reviewed the sellers listing again and there is no mention of it being full-screen.  Wish I would have known this earlier.  It's annoying but not a huge problem, but if this bothers you, make sure you check which version you are buying.",1395187200,,452,4.6835443037974684

2912364,4,B000TZJBP6,Even my husband enjoyed this comedy.  It is something to watch that you don't have to think about and makes you laugh in the meantime.  (Although I felt so sorry that a one night stand caused all the problems.  And I hope that younger people don't think that having a child and raising it is so easy.),1388448000,,301,4.245614035087719

2912370,5,B000TZJBP6,This is a really dumb movie about a really dumb guy who accidentally wins the heart of a really beautiful girl.  And you know what.  I ended up loving every minute of it.

2912371,5,B000TZJBP6,"One of the funniest, most endearing comedies in recent years. Seth Rogen is perfect as the less-than-perfect guy who suddenly finds himself in the position of becoming a daddy, and potential mate to a lovely girl (played by Katy Heigel) who is the mother-to-be. The whole movie contains plots and sub-plots that ring true to many of our life experiences, one way or another. Highly recommended!",1382227200,,394,4.984848484848484
2912372,5,B000TZJBP6,"Would probably give it 4.5 starts, since it's predictable. The humor was exceptional, very light mood for the movie, but with human values included.",1380499200,,148,5.208333333333333

it shows both sides, how men are insensitive and how women are oversensitive.

the actor dude like in most of his movies is such a loser, so you dislike him..

he is probalby a loser in real life too..  he just seems like  a dork looking dweeb, makes no sense why the actress in the movie would fall for  such a loser. if he was even halfway cool, the movie would make more sense.",1380067200,,414,3.9878048780487805

Heigel herself) But nobody seems to make a single mention of how offensive this movie is to men.
 Let me explain:
 The women in the movie are attractive, smart, strong, and independent.  And they spend most of the movie verbally abusing the men in their lives!  I consider myself a strong proponent of equal rights, but after hearing these women, over and over and over, continue to call these men stupid and moronic and asses and just about ever other insult out there, I began to side with the poor men!
 In one scene, a woman, desperate to catch her husband cheating, follows him, sneaks into the house and ""catches"" him playing fantasy baseball with friends.  If it was me, I would be relieved that he wasn't cheating, and embarrassed that I acted so foolishly.  NO!  This women instead begins to yell at and berate him for not wanting to spend every single waking second with her!  Well, I for one can see why!
 Think about it.  What if it was the other way around?  What if it was a bunch of attractive, smart, strong men constantly insulting and berating their less than perfect women?  Would that movie even see the light of day?  I doubt it.  Why has it become so commonplace and acceptable for women to treat men with utter contempt?  Respect is a two-way street, ladies.

2912444,4,B000TZJBP6,"Seth Rogan is at the top of his game today, having hit it big with his recent string of hits.  His stoner humor has spoken volumes to even those who don't smoke pot.  It's about bonding between friends if nothing else.  And every once in a while we make mistakes and we have to grow up real fast, which is what this movie is all about.

Kathrine Heigl (Allison) is an up and coming television personality at the E! Channel who is out celebrating her new promotion.  On the night in question, she goes to a bar and meets Ben (Seth Rogan), they get super drunk and hit the sack.  Ben is a bit of a loser who lives with a bunch of stoner friends who are ineptly limping along through life designing their own web site (Flesh of the Stars) in typical frat boy manner.  Weeks later, Allison discovers that she is pregnant and is going to keep it.  And now, they are together.

It does drag in a few places, but don't laugh too hard until it happens to you or someone you know.  How many people end up in this situation?  Fortunately for Allison and Ben they learn to love each other, even like each other.  But there will be a million gals who do this either on purpose to trap a man, want someone to love, or do it out of some self fulfilling want?  Irresponsible?  Sure it is, but he who is without sin may cast the first stone.  We have no choice but to laugh at the scene where Allison is crying when she gets the definate from the doctor that she is pregnant.  The observations from their parents, friends and family are hilarious.  And it has a heart warming ending, which is, I admit, rather nice.",1338076800,,1599,4.224422442244224

2912448,2,B000TZJBP6,"Romance and romantic comedies are my favorite type of movie, and so I'm pretty tolerant of even the mediocre ones. Knocked Up is worse than mediocre.

The premise has comic potential: A schmoe of a guy (I mean, an unattractive, immature, profane slob who wants to do drugs all the time, masturbate to porn and never get a job) by pure luck scores a one-night stand with a beautiful, ambitious and successful woman. Well, it's not exactly pure luck that gets them together; they're both drunk out of their minds and don't know what they're doing. Ben - the schmoe - doesn't even remember the fantastic sex he had with Alison - the beautiful woman. Alison at least is smart enough the next morning to limit the damage to a one-night stand, though Ben was hoping for more.

And that would be the end except that Alison discovers she is pregnant a couple of months later. What does a beautiful, intelligent, ambitious, and successful woman do? Well, of course, she calls Ben and just about immediately starts planning to spend her life with him, because their kid deserves the chance to have the traditional pair of loving parents. Okay, I can go with that, it's still got some comic potential, and Alison (Katherine Heigl) is nice enough to look at. :-)

Ben has no problem hooking up with the beautiful and employed Alison. He's not exactly crazy about being a dad, but hey, a girl like Alison doesn't drop in on your life every day. And Alison isn't stuck up or condescending to Ben at all. She seems perfectly willing to let him continue with his lifestyle of drugs and unemployment. She laughs at all his rude, crude attempts at humor. Much to Ben's delight, she is perfectly willing to initiate plenty of sex with him, and she's not shy about telling him how much she likes it. Every schmoe's fantasy, right?

There's more to the story. There's Alison's sister, her husband, and their two kids. They have a pretty dysfunctional marriage, but in the end they love each other in their own volatile way. In one scene with the kids, a little girl tells Ben that she heard her parents call him a prick and she asks what that means. Ben, being the straightforward kind of guy he is, explains that it's a penis. The little girl laughs and repeats the word. I've seen other movies where making little kids say sexual words is intended to be funny. I'm no prude - when it's done well I enjoy crude humor as much as the next schmoe - but I really fail to see what is so funny about profane kids? Was that scene really necessary? It serves to demonstrate the level of the humor in this raunchy film - there is a lot of gratuitous profanity from all of the main characters. And it's the profanity itself that is supposed to be funny. It's not as if the profanity is embedded within the wit and sophistication. Profanity, in and of itself, is funny to some people, but ever since I was a teenager I usually need a little more than that.

There's one more aspect to the story - the various ""bromances."" Guys loving to hang out with other guys. The crude humor works best between the guys, maybe because I'm a guy. But I'm also a guy who loves to watch a good romantic comedy, so the parts with the girls has got to be good, too. :-)

The movie did shine in a few places, which is why I'm giving it two stars. The scene with the doorman (Craig Robinson) when Alison and her older sister go clubbing featured some absurdly funny humor. There was some great lowbrow humor in the scene where all of Ben's roomies get pink eye. There's sort of a running gag about all the gynecologists. If the entire movie was up to the level of those scenes, I'd give it four stars.

If you enjoy comedies that rely on a lot of crudeness and profanity, you'll enjoy this movie. If you're a schmoe who fantasizes about a beautiful girl getting stuck on you, you'll enjoy this movie. If you prefer romantic comedies with wit, warmth, and humor, you might not enjoy this movie.",1330128000,3,3942,4.459084604715673

2. the comedy- a few chuckles here and there but not a ton of laughs. Simply being crude is not funny- there needs to be some humor attatched to the crudeness.

Alison is a pretty career girl and Ben is a slovenly, unemployed man with a severe case of arrested development.  This mix throws up some sparks and plenty of hilarity.
There are crass jokes a-plenty here, but nothing so outrageous that it is distasteful and the relationship between Ben and Alison is genuinely touching despite all it's flaws.

The supporting cast are great as well with Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill adding extra humour to an already funny film.

2912470,4,B000TZJBP6,"I'm not really sure why it took me so long to actually see this movie, but last night I sat down with some sour patch kids and a 7-Up and braced myself for that comedy that every one of my friends told me was utterly hilarious.  I know that it has its detractors, but by and large `Knocked Up' is considered a very funny movie, and I have to agree.  What is so much better than just being funny is that the film actually makes good of its soft center.  I actually cried (once).

Like my review titled states; I laughed, I cried, I thoroughly enjoyed.

The film follows the outcome of a drunken one-night stand between man-boy slacker Ben and financially unstable business woman Alison.  Almost immediately after they awaken, Alison knows that Ben is not suitable dating material (he has no job, no phone and is quite vulgar) but eight weeks later she is forced back into his life when she finds out she is pregnant.  Alison, who is living with her sister Debbie and brother-in-law Pete, decides to give a relationship a shot with Ben, and she realizes that behind all that immaturity is a really decent guy (charming and caring and genuinely sweet).  Of course, with pregnancy comes drama, drama that is exaggerated due to difference between these two opposites, but `Knocked Up' handles these Hollywood clich&eacute;s in a fresh way that excites and entertains.

I find it odd that the films star Katherine Heigl had such a scathing remark to make of the film.

She said:

""It paints the women as shrews, as humorless and uptight, and it paints the men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys,"" she says. ""It was hard for me to love the movie.""

I actually felt that the film was pretty accurate in its portrayal of relationships between men and women.  It has to be pointed out that this is a comedy and that comedies, especially of this nature, are prone to exaggerate truths, but the fact still remains that they are truths.  Besides, we are not dealing with all women but with two very specific types; single pregnant women and middle-aged married women with children.  The hormones that reign Queen with those two types I feel are represented (with embellishments) rather truthfully here.  And let's not forget that the men are presented in a less than perfect light as well.  Sure, they are `fun-loving' but they are all brazenly immature.  While I completely understand Pete's need to get away and have a break, the way in which he does it is rather selfish, and I totally sided with Debbie (even if she did go overboard).  You see, both sides are handed a fair share of critisism, even if the men are painted in a more likable light; but that's because we are fun-loving (to a fault at times).

In the end, both sides have to work towards a compromise.

As far as the acting is concerned, for the most part everyone works wonderfully.  Seth Rogan has this really sweet and charming likableness to him; you just want to get to know him.  Katherine Heigl plays her part beautifully, and really gets to the heart of this woman who just wants to be happy but doesn't understand what it is that will make her happy.  The supporting cast is also pretty great; especially Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd, who chew up the scenery as Debbie and Pete.  Mann is truly well rounded, providing just enough vulnerability (that breakdown when she uncovers Pete's `secret' is just fantastic) to make her cold exterior forgivable.  Ben's slacker buddies are all merely background fluff, but I was shocked that I really disliked Jason Segel here.  I really liked him in `I Love You, Man' where he was creepy but in a strangely charming kind of way.  Here, he's just creepy.  I want to bring up that Kristen Wiig and the sadly underused Alan Tudyk have very small yet very memorable cameos here.

LOVE THEM.

In the end, I really enjoyed this film.  It has some parts that wane on the unrealistic (the doctor at the end is completely unbelievable and kind of annoying when you think about it...I mean, if our doctor had responded that way when my daughter was born I would have punched her in the face without any hesitation) but overall it is a really charming and fun movie.  Part of me wanted to give this five-stars, but it isn't perfect and it isn't as well rounded as, say `I Love You, Man' or `Superbad', but it is definitely a film I'd recommend.

And yes, like I said, I cried; when that Loudon Wainwright III song `Daughter' comes on during the closing credits I just couldn't contain myself.

2912479,4,B000TZJBP6,"""Knocked Up"" is a romantic comedy starring Seth Rogen as Ben Stone & Katherine Heigl as Alison Scott. Co-starring Paul Rudd & Leslie Mann.

In the movie ""Knocked Up"", Alison Scott (Heigl) is a responsible twenty something career woman who just been promoted to an on-air TV position for E! Entertainment Television. On the day of her promotion, Alison & her sister Debbie (Mann) goes out to celebrate at a nightclub where she would end up meeting Ben (Rogen). Ben is an unmotivated, not all that attractive, pudgy, curly hair single guy who doesn't really have a job ""per se"" where he & his friends are working on this special Web site called ""fleshofthestars.com"" where it shows certain nude scenes from movies of actresses. After meeting Ben at the nightclub, Alison falls inlove with Ben's great personality & charm. After a night of craziness, Ben & Alison end up sleeping with each other & thats where all the trouble begins to start.

After sleeping with Ben, Alison knows she made a huge mistake sleeping with him. After a few weeks gone by, Alison finds out that she is indeed pregnant & has to tell Ben that he is the father. From there, Ben & Alison tries to navigate theirselves in how they are going to make this unplanned pregnancy work where a lot of questions has to be answer from both sides, where is my future going? is this the person who I want to spend the rest of my life with? do we keep the baby or not? how is this going to affect my career? All of these questions are tackled in a humorous & entertaining way all throughout the movie.

Meanwhile, Alison's sister Debbie is also having problems of her own with her husband, Pete (Rudd) & with Ben being the father of Alison's baby. Where on the other side, Ben's buddies has to figure out how they are going to fix everything dealing with their Web site with Ben's unborn baby on the way.

In the end though, everything works out from all angles with Ben & Alison falling inlove with each other & raising their baby like a true family.

""Knocked Up"" is a great, funny, & entertaining movie. This film is everything that it is advertised to be, a romantic comedy & more. This is a movie where you would want to watch over & over again. I definitely recommend this.",1248652800,,2238,4.488943488943489
2912480,5,B000TZJBP6,"I have really fallen in love with this new emerging comedy circle that centralizes around Seth Rogen, Judd Apatow, Jonah Hill and all the others that have appearances in this film.  They have a fresh raw comedic taste that sweeps all the B- comedies of late under the rug.  It can be very raunchy and offensive, but why hold them back?  Only comparable to Kevin Smith films, the Judd Apatow movies aren't afraid to unvail all the taboo were so afraid of.

Knocked up is different from the ""circles'"" other movies, because it has so much more substance.  The unplanned pregnancy is what happens quite frequently these days, and I believe this movie encourages us to take a closer look.  The movie may be built of crude jokes, but by the end it will be tugging at your heart strings.  I'm sure it takes a lot of talent to create a movie that appeals to both women and men, and furthermore to create it so unrated and yet sincere.  I reccomend this film very much to those who have an open mind for comedy, because it really does have constructive behavior as well as guilty pleasure.

The Blu-ray treatment is great, and I really have no complaints.  I'm really fed up with Universal's universal blu-ray menu, but aside from all that the movie pulls along fine.  Some of the special features are just as funny as the movie.  ""Finding Ben Stone"" has got to be one of the most comical special extra on a blu-ray/dvd I have ever seen.  The special features weigh more than the cost of the blu-ray.

So like everyone else will say, if you liked ""Superbad"" and ""40 Year Old Virgin"" you have to add this to your collection.  It's Superbad with a stronger theme and realer circumstances.  If you're looking for a great comedy that you can take something from, Knocked Up is the movie you're looking for.",1248393600,,1794,4.507739938080495

If I had known that,I would have waited til I could see it free in a few years on tv and I would have maybe not been as terribly disappointed.  I figured ""unrated"" means a rating is pending-but I think it means it's way too raunchy to be NC17 and we could get in trouble with R if we aren't careful.  When I know in advance it's a raunchy comedy, rather than a funny romance, I'll watch it with appropriate people who will find raunchy to be funny but since they chose ""unrated"", I didn't know that part - I'm glad I didn't watch it with my mother or something thinking it would be a good, romance chick flick.

A pleasant surprise to be sure, I had very low expectations from the flick just based on the lame title.  Gald I was wrong.  Seth Rogen is very funny and leads a life I can only envy.  While an outlined description of the plot would make one cringe, the execution is excellent.  I usually detest movies that lack proper editing to keep them at ninety minutes or less, but funny writing, good acting, and adequate production quality make for an entertaining 129 minutes on this one.  I say the only real flaw is a few of the scenes drag a bit and the set-up suggesting that a good looking chick like Katherine Heigl would actually EVER sleep with a guy that looks like Seth Rogen, let alone have a kid with him is utterly absurd.  Nonetheless, if you can get over that idiocy, then Knocked-Up is a funny flick.

SUPERBAD does seem to be the most popular thus far  but KNOCKED UP is in the same league for me.

Story line is pretty basic.  We have an average stoner guy and a beautiful professional woman who meet at a bar, get drunk, have sex and she gets pregnant.  In real life such different types of people may not try to make  a relationship work but here it is very believable and the development of each character about life, love and acceptance is very realistic as the pregnancy develops.  Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogen are in top form as their lives are forever altered.  Dialogue is funny, circumstances are realistic and having the marriage of Heigl's sister to compare with works great.  Paul Rudd shines here and steals all the scenes he is in.

This is a bawdy comedy but manages to put across positive messages about safe sex, responsibility and the fact that relationships can be difficult.  It is not a message film by any means but it manages to spread a good positive vein about life and its complications.

Blu ray usually is put to its best use with action films or films with great cinematography which show how the 1080p can be brilliant and how audio can transcend.  Comedies can sometimes appear bland on blu ray but this film is crisp, colors are vibrant and video and audio are both at levels above that of the regular dvd.  There is much talk of this movie being too long.  For me it was not.  You will either love it or you won't.  For me it had a purpose in the length and the character development also warranted it.

Severely overlong for a romantic comedy (130 minutes?

Look people, you have to be somewhat simpleminded to get Knocked Up and then be offended by crass humour, fat blokes getting off with beautiful women, possible fart gags and rude words/nudity. What on earth do you expect? The film is directed by a director who specialises in directing films about general childlike and puerile behaviour, and stars people who were all in his previous 300 films featuring exactly the same sort of humour.

You might as well write, ""I bought 'Planet of the Apes' on Amazon the other day but was disgusted to find gratuitous scenes of monkeys riding around on horses and speaking. Everyone knows that this is not standard simian behaviour. David Attenborough wasn't in it even once!""

Get with the programme. Kathryn Heigl is bloody delicious in this, and liked it so much she got knocked up herself, talk about life imitating art. And in an ironic turn of events, the plot line about the married man not cheating, but attending a fantasy baseball league rings some familiar home truths as well (as other reviewers have pointed out), art imitating life in my case.

This one is directed by Apatow himself; so, you you know it's one of the better ones that carries his ""brand""...unlike some of those cheeseball movies with Will Ferrel.  More to the point, you get the sense that he made this movie for himself or his family.  For example, his wife in real life is Leslie Mann, and his daughters play his and Leslie's daughters in the movie.  But enough about a review of the content...I assume that if you're considering the Blu-Ray release of Knocked Up, you've seen the movie before.

I don't know about you, but when I am considering purchasing a Blu-Ray, what I want to know is (in order of importance) 1) How good does it look?  2) How good does it sound?  3) What special features distinguish it from the DVD version that I might possibly own already.  The picture quality is good but not amazing.  I have yet to find a BD that has worse picture quality than its DVD counterpart, but we're not expecting minor improvements from the BD.  Considering a dual layer BD can hold 50 GB compared to a DVD-9 that can hold 8.5 GB, we expect A LOT more from Blu-Ray...and rightfully so!  The audio is fine, but my expectations for a comedy are much lower as I tend to be more interested in content than technical achievements and fidelity; whereas, action movies force me to be a more discerning critic.

Lastly, the special features are good but nothing, IMO, that warrants buying this disc if you already own the DVD.  Again, if you're like me, you're only going to watch the special features so many times.  The audio and video quality of the main title are what I am most interested in, and I am unwilling to pay $20 for the BD version at this time.

2912507,1,B000TZJBP6,"A movie aimed directly at the 14-15 y.o., high school dropout audience--you know that segment of the population still titillated by the F-word.  Unfunny, stupid, and totally unbelievable.  An attractive young woman with everything going for her gets drunk and has sex with a stupid, foul-mouthed, unattractive, overweight man who has exactly nothing going for him.  In the morning she wants to chew off her arm when she sees what she has been sleeping up but when she finds out she's pregnant--wonder of wonders--she tries to establish a relationship with the dirty, drug-befuddled loser who lives with half a dozen equally scuzzy men, half of whom are homosexual.  Not to worry, he is attempting, albeit unsuccessfully, to make a living showing scenes of naked starlets clipped from movies.

Well, I'll admit the foregoing has some slight potential but the writers, directors, producers of this dreck make a mess even of this.  Long before it is over I started to feel sick to my stomach but kept watching, wondering if there was a redeeming moment at the end.  There wasn't...incredibly, it got even worse.  Some movies are so very bad that they become slightly interesting.  This one isn't one of them.

No doubt, quite deliberately on the part of the brain-dead director and writers, there's something here to offend almost anyone with semi-average sensibilties.  Of special interest to me, is the use of small children to mouth crude sexual lines.  This may not be illegal but it verges...closely...on child-abuse.",1228348800,5,1519,5.080645161290323

2912510,3,B000TZJBP6,"How is it possible that so many people are clueless about what a Judd Apatow movie entails? Scores of these reviews condemn this movie for being too crass, offensive, etc., as if they were expecting a Billy Wilder romp instead of a movie made in another century. This is the guy who has given us a wealth of movies which all tap extensively if not exclusively into the lowbrow, locker room, sophomoric comedic vein that is ala mode. Why would you think this offering would be any different?
That being said, I found it funny. Yes, the plot line is hard to swallow. The hot tv personality finding love with the unemployed, corpulent, stoner loser simply because they had a drunken night of sex is straight Hollywood fantasy. Still, it isn't unrealistic that beautiful women go for less-than-handsome guys; just ask Ric Ocasek or Billy Joel. What I found most appealing is the deadly accuracy of the marriage between Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann's characters, the latter playing main character Alison's (Katherine Heigl) sister. The palpable angst that permeates their relationship is very real and very honest, as anyone who has had a failed marriage can attest, especially one built largely upon the arrival of children. Within the jokes about genitalia et al are some astute points about relationships, kids, acceptance, and maturity.
As for the jokes, I am on the fifty side of my mid-forties and I still laugh out loud at many of them, as crude as they may be. I work with a largely twenty-something crowd and I have come to realize that there is a generational change in what is funny, what is socially acceptable, what offends, and what passes for a new morality, if you'll pardon the usage of such a dangerous word. All I can recommend to those who don't find this kind of humor their style; don't watch it! We can argue the sociological, cultural, or moral implications of such a change in morays all day and night, but in the end, you either find it funny or you don't. But please spare the rest of us your whining. At this stage in the game, your ""Oh! My virgin ears! I'm so offended"" cries are contrived and disingenuous attempts to stab at the heart of a cultural change that you no longer are a part of. Every generation has its day and yours is past.

2912513,3,B000TZJBP6,"2007's Judd Apatow hit 'Knocked Up' was the first of a few 'smash hits' in the young comedy genre of film for the year, starring Seth Rogen as Ben Stone a slacker trying to start up an internet business with his buddies that points out when women are naked in different movies, who gets lucky when he hooks up with E networks newest onscreen personality Alison Scott(Katherine Heigl).

When one night of fun turns  into a highly unexpected pregnancy for Alison, how will she cope with the idea of her own baby, plus Ben's childlike behaviors.

To be frank, Knocked up has it's funny parts, but I just can't get around the point of looking at having a baby as something so casual. I prefer Stepbrothers, or Superbad.",1224979200,,715,4.5703125
2912514,2,B000TZJBP6,"I really wanted to like this movie, but it just fell completely flat for me.  The acting was good, but I didn't find hardly any of it funny.  Maybe it's just ""guy humor"" that I don't understand, or my unexplainable, intense fear of pregnancy and babies, but overall the movie was just disgusting to me.",1223942400,,302,4.472727272727273

They don't know each other very well, they don't have the same interests and are not at all prepared to become parents. Coarse and crude, the film is presented as an example of the new American comedy. Why not, after all ? I smiled two or three times then vainly tried to find what the director wanted to tell us with KNOCKED UP and finally gave up. It wasn't worth the time and my energy. Already forgotten.",1223510400,3,508,4.302083333333333
2912516,1,B000TZJBP6,"This ""comedy"" is just like all the others out there today.  For some reason a movie made flatulance, sex and drugging funny.  Because it was a success in that first movie it seems every single ""comedy"" since has fallen into the same trap.  Instead of being original and coming up with their own jokes they copy all the other movies and repeat it verbatim.  The only difference is they take different actors and actresses and make it ""unpredictable"" by changing up where the jokes are going to go.  Give it a new name and you have ""A fresh and hilarious comedy sure to entertain!""

This is one of those movies.  There's no originality (in plot or jokes) and it's annoying to watch.  I hate movies that like to get cheap laughs.  It's insulting to me but obviously the producers know their audience well because it never fails to get a ""falling on the floor crying"" response out of 12 year olds.  And why, why, WHY do people think the more vulgar a movie is and the more they swear the ""cooler"" and ""funnier"" the movie is.  I'm so tired of the f-bomb getting dropped every other word.  Swearing was cool when you were, say, back in middle school.  When you're out of college it just makes you sound like trailer trash and uneducated.  And I hate how men think it's OK to be vulgar towards women and women actually think it's OK too!  Hilarious.

So if you like stupid (as in really stupid) stuff that has a lot of farting, vulgarity and is unoriginal, this is the movie for you.  If you're tired of the same ol' stupidity with a different name, then skip this one (along with 90% of all the other ""comedies"" out there today).",1222128000,3,1623,4.410774410774411

Re:  the relationship between Alison's sister and her husband, I didn't see it as absolutely awful so much as a phase when the marriage was unusually challenged, which, of course, serves as an example of what Ben and Alison don't want to be.

Katherine Heigl is engaging and adorable, and I have to say pretty shocking in some of the seedier scenes.  Meg Ryan (a la Sally) has got nothing on Katherine!

The Bad: The male cast. The mere notion that even with the thickest beer goggles Katherine Heigl would wind up in bed with Seth Rogen is just absurd.  There are also some plot mistakes.  For instance, both Allison (Heigl) and Ben (Rogen) say in one breath that they don't remember anything from the fateful night, yet a moment later they both remember the condom moment perfectly.  The movie is also riddled with drug use, as well as the f-bomb that seems to purvey all of Apatow's/Rogen's movies.  This is essentially another gutter movie (like Superbad), brought up to perhaps the curb by Heigl.  Despite some ultimately decent intentions, it just falls short.

The Summary: Allison goes clubbing with her married sister Debbie, where she meets Ben.  He buys them beers and after Debbie winds up leaving, Allison and Ben wind up dancing and getting very drunk.  One thing leads to another and, well, Allison is pregnant.  She is obviously repulsed at the mere thought that she slept with Ben, and now she is pregnant with his child.  They spend most of the rest of the movie getting to know each other (and Ben's obnoxiously disgusting friends).

She had her job, her looks and other things going for her when she found out that Ben didn't use a condom when she specifically asked him to.

Right before the act, Ben takes the almost-on condom off because there was a misinterpretation between the two, aka a broken message. She gets pregnant and emotional once she finds out.

The characters are funny and many, attractive. The dialogue wasn't too shabby but they swear a lot. Especially the use of the ""F-word"".

She is a beautiful ON-AIR reporter for E! Entertainment Network (implausibly plucked from her job as floor director, but that's a whole different ridicularity), and he is a low-brow, unemployed, illegal alien Canadian slacker who somehow pays rent, buys marijuana, beer and about $100 of new books at Barnes & Noble - all on a $450 annual budget. Yes, that's right.  He's stretched $13,900 of a $14,000 personal injury settlement over seven years, and estimates the last $900 will get him two more.

Writer/Director Judd Apatow might've had something here had he written these characters as slightly less than quantum galaxies apart, in income, sophistication, looks, talent and ambition. Perhaps she could have remained a floor director at E!, a sufficiently glamorous job, and he a part-time clerk at a Blockbuster store while working on his celebrity movie nude-scene website (don't ask) in his spare time.  Throw in some very graphic and uncomfortable sex scenes, a poorly written sister/brother-in-law dynamic that is strewn with holes, the fact there is no second act at all (or was it no third act?), roundly unimpressive acting performances, and well, and you're left with nothing.

""Knocked Up"", a comedy and love story about a pair of mismated lovers that brew up a child, is the funniest and most touching film I've seen in months. It has humor, good acting, strong production values and a topical message for people that like that sort of thing. It is escapist fare for the 20-something set that also appeals to anyone that's seen a Doris Day-Rock Hudson screwball comedy. Had that pair made their films in the new century, the result surely would have been ""Knocked Up"".

I'd recommend this movie to anyone above the age of PG-13 viewership and even to some kids younger than that. This, principally, is because of the way the film deals with the awkward situation created when a couple meets in a bar, has a one nighter, and that results in a child. Much of what goes on in this film is a realistic portrayal of the realities of such a situation. The rest is done for fun and this movie is a lot of fun.

There is no question why this film was an overwhelming hit both in the theaters and with critics around the world. It has all the elements of great filmmaking -- likeable characters, situations the audience can relate to, very strong production values and good acting in all the principal roles. While the characterizations are two dimensional, that should not detract from anyone's enjoyment of this flick.

Part of it is that Katherine Heigl's recent interviews on this movie and on Grey's Anatomy have left me with little respect for her, making it kind of hard to listen to her shrillness.

The general plot of the movie isn't believable (since when does a successful woman decide to date the high school drop out, even if she does get pregnant by him?) and believability is forgivable if the comedic potential is realized, but here it is not, which simply leaves me feeling like it's trying to be absurd but somehow failing.",1214784000,3,740,4.466666666666667
2912530,1,B000TZJBP6,"The message Hollywood appears to be sending burgeoning cradle to
grave twenty-something consumers in this crude, unintelligent,
pathetic film is  ""Go ahead! Be irresponsible! Show a complete and
utter lack of common sense! Have no self-respect and get pregnant
out of wedlock with the next drunken rube who comes along! Why?
Because everybody loves babies!""

This film is as offensive and unsettling as movies can get. There's
absolutely no resonance to the film....no emotional core to help
even justify the ludicrous relationship between these two
characters and what transpires. The film's bottom line is
sometimes (often?) white, middle class twenty-somethings get
drunk, and babies are born....and sometimes (almost never?)
the egg donor and the sperm donor end up staying together
against all odds and the child is subsequently raised in a
loving, healthy family environment. Needless to say, the
f-bombs tossed around in the movie are beyond overkill, as
are the adolescent antics of the male lead and his
neanderthal roommates. Simply put, it's a horrible film.

Still, the overwhelming sucess of this movie among young adults
(I use the term ""adults"" loosely) and the film's beyond misguided
attempt at providing a ""heartwarming"" love story under the guise
of ""comedy"" holds up a very real mirror to the American cultural
obsession with motherhood, pregnancy and childbirth on the one
hand and Hollywood's stop-at-nothing attitude toward harnessing
the basest aspects of American youth culture in order to make a
buck.

Katherine Heigl was right when she claimed the subject matter of
Knocked Up was offensive to women. The title says it all. If only
the beautiful and talented Ms. Heigl had steered clear of the movie
altogether and directed her talents to a more worthy endeavor. I'm
sure she would be the first to agree.",1214697600,30,1832,5.22108843537415
2912531,1,B000TZJBP6,"I have to agree with the ""Just Plain Crude"" review. If you took out all the profanity, 95% of the dialogue would disappear. The sex scenes made it embarrassing to watch, even though it was just my husband and I viewing it.  We're in our early 40's and are probably too old for this movie but we wonder if this is the way most 20 somethings communicate today. It was quite offensive, to say the least.
That being said, there were some moments when I admired Ben and Alison's attempts at working out their relationship, highly improbable though that was, and accepting responsibility for the new life they created in drunken stupidity. The scene where Ben talks to the obnoxious stand-in obstetrician on Alison's behalf, is almost touching. But when he reams out her regular doctor on the phone, his whole tirade can be bleeped out. This movie has an Adam Sandler quality about it. Just when a serious moment arises, it's blown out of the water by something weird, obscene or vulgar.
Had it not been for the overall crude nature of this movie, the basic story of a young couple dealing with a life changing event may have worked. But ""Knocked Up"" handles it badly. I wish I hadn't wasted my time watching it.",1214524800,4,1206,4.583333333333333

All us guys talk ""locker room"" when by ourselves...but crude references to oral (and other kinds) of sex in front of women?  If this is really the way younger people talk nowadays, our society is headed for extinction.  I watched this movie strictly because of Katherine Heigl whom I think is adorable and whose looks remind me of the pretty girls from the 50's and 60's.  It was disappointing to hear her use such vulgarity.  I know she's a professional actress and it's her job to read the script.  Hopefully she will get much better films than this to work in as she's very appealing on screen and a decent actress.  The story itself is good, but hardly believeable.  Nowadays, few women that attractive would hook up with such a geeky-looking guy like that for one night, much less fall in love with him and bear his child.",1214092800,12,992,4.533707865168539
2912533,3,B000TZJBP6,"Allison Scott (Katherine Heigl) just got a promotion, so she and her sister go out to celebrate. She has a few too many to drink, meets Ben Stone (Seth Rogen), and has a one-night stand with him.

A few weeks later, she discovers she's pregnant. After some soul-searching and a lot of cringing, she decides she'd better tell Ben. He vows to stick with her and help raise the baby.

Ben lives with his buddies, smokes pot, and they have desultory plans to create a celebrity website, but they don't work on it much. At first, he keeps on with his life the way it is, but little by little, he starts growing up and taking responsibility.

There's a secondary plot with Allison's sister and her husband having a crisis in their marriage that serves to both encourage and warn Allison and Ben about their future.

It was a cute movie, as far as it went. I'm not sure I understand the rave reviews: 7.8 stars on the IMDB for a comedy is amazing. That's the same as The Blues Brothers and Blazing Saddles and Stranger than Fiction got, and this is nowhere in the same league as those. Different tastes, maybe, but those had more going on than just humorous situations. Maybe this one did, too, and I just didn't see it.

My favorite part of the movie was Ben's growth, and, to a lesser extent, Allison's. It was presented with humor and sympathy. The problems between Allison's sister and brother-in-law were realistic, but I couldn't sympathize with either of them, which made it less effective for me.

The premise, however, just didn't sit well with me. Because of a one-night stand, this couple is deciding on a permanent commitment to each other. It just made me squirm, and nearly turned the movie into a pro-life propaganda piece. Allison does initially turn down Ben's marriage proposal, but neither of them ever question whether they should be together permanently or not--just whether they should have the little piece of paper.

Much of that has, I admit, more to do with me than with the movie. I've been married 23+ years, and I know how much work marriage is, even when you love each other. Then, too, I have a 22-year-old daughter who's far too prone to trying to make relationships work even when she'd be better off letting go, and I couldn't help seeing her in the same situation.

2912535,2,B000TZJBP6,"Critics, what were you smokin'?  ""knocked Up,"" 2007's surprise blockbuster from Hollywood's new R-rated comedy king Judd Apatow, got such positive spin that I was primed for a raunchy good time.  Nearly 2 1/2 hours later I, like most of the characters in this movie, needed anger management.  Never have I seen a ""romantic"" comedy this hell bent on bucking logic as well as taste. (And never have I heard the word ""F--k"" used this much since ""Scarface."")

The premise is simple.  Think ""Beauty and the Geek.""  A gorgeous up and coming TV personality (Gray's Anatamy's Katherine Heigl) sleeps with an unemployed loser (Seth Rogen) after a drunken night out.  She gets pregnant.  They play house.

Now, in the movie world this plot line would make sense under one precondition:  that the loser would be such a lovable little loon that we would root for him to win the girl's heart against all odds.  It would also help if the loser was played by someone with some crazed zeal like Jack Black or Adam Sandler.  In the person of Seth Rogen we just get one thing- a loser.  Rogen's character is such a pot-headed man/child and a foul-mouthed cry baby that we can in no way believe the beautiful Heigl would touch him with a ten foot pole. It like walking into a depressing movie version of hell where a glamorous actress settles for an uninteresting minor player instead of the charismatic leading man.

Is it funny?  Sure, if your definition of funny is seeing every character going into some foul-mouthed rant as if they were caffeine addicts told that their local Starbucks was out of coffee.  Even Ryan Seacrest in a cameo is in desperate need of a time out.  And I'm no prude. I've often argued  that profanity if used in the proper context can almost be poetry. Richard Pryor and George Carlin are trash talkin' Shakespeares.  Apatow's script is just trash.  Cuss words here are not icing on the cake but filler for lack of anything better to say.

In a way ""Knocked Up"" presents a world as seen through the eyes of a 15-year old.  It's a pubescent fantasy where that unobtainable hottie is into slackers who have no ambition, smoke dope, and like Internet porn.  It's a ""romantic comedy"" for the Howard Stern set. It's also proof positive that TV is becoming increasing smarter and better written.  Remember on ""Friends"" when Ross and Rachel spent hour after agonizing hour in the maternity ward? Hilarious, right?  No?  Then this F-bombed comedy is for you.",1212364800,4,2460,4.6892523364485985

2912537,3,B000TZJBP6,"""Knocked Up"" revolves around the importance of using birth control, especially when you're sleeping with a less-than-desirable partner. Alison (Katherine Heigl) and Ben (Seth Rogen) meet at a club and hook up for a drunken one-night-stand that results in an unplanned pregnancy. This mismatched couple tries to make things work for the sake of their unborn baby, but it isn't easy. Alison and Ben are as different as two people can be. She's gorgeous, classy, and has a successful career. He's chubby and stoned most of the time, and his only professional ambition is to launch a successful Web site that revolves around female nudity in films. Despite their differences, Alison and Ben manage to support each other until Alison finally begins to question whether Ben is capable of being a responsible father figure.

I enjoyed this movie. There are a lot of funny moments in the film, but there are also quite a bit of not-so-funny scenes. Heigl and Rogen both deliver solid performances, but there is absolutely no chemistry between their characters as a couple, and I couldn't understand why Alison was so desperate to make her relationship with Ben work out, even though she had a baby on the way. Also, beware the crowning scene near the end of the movie (I did NOT need to see that!). Fortunately, ""Knocked Up"" boasts a wonderful supporting cast. Alison's sister and brother-in-law are absolutely hilarious, and I though Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd were the best parts of the movie.

The Teddy bear scene, and Asian girl (share food with the baby) scenes are my favorite.

I must warn that the humor is at times rather crass. It didn't bother me at all because I enjoy toilet humor, but it thoroughly disgusted my poor mother.

2912544,4,B000TZJBP6,"Judd Apatow has become to today's slackers what John Hughes was to teenagers in the mid-80s.  He has tapped into the zeitgeist of guy-dom with fresh comedies that are as identifiable by their sly humor as they are by their lingering pace.  ""Knocked Up,"" like ""The 40-Year Old Virgin,"" takes its time.

Seth Rogan, whose lovable, bemused mug personifies the picture, plays Ben Stone.  Ben is a slacker - a Canadian who has moved to the states to make some easy money (but without a plan), surviving on the $14K he got in an accident settlement.  Ben hangs with a worthy batch of slackers who are convinced they can make it big by developing a website cataloging nudity in mainstream films - although it's somewhat surprising nobody has heard of Mr. Skin.  It's a given that these guys are lovable and hilarious, not to mention perpetually stoned.

Katherine Heigl has the other key lead as Alison Scott.  She celebrates her big break - getting a chance to ""anchor"" the ""news"" on the E Channel - by clubbing with her obnoxious married big sister Debbie (Leslie Mann).  Alison beer-goggles her way into Ben's bed, and a miscommunication later, she's got morning sickness on camera.

When Alison decides to keep the baby and also have Ben involved, the plot is more or less set - can these two misfits make a family?  While this may be the most overdone plot device in modern TV and movies, ""Knocked Up"" handles it with maturity and hilarity.  Ben has to grow up and realize he's worthy of a dream-girl, and Alison has to come to terms with her new career trajectory and a life with Ben.

Look for great laughs and some real emotion here, particularly as Debbie and her husband Pete (Paul Rudd) go through their own version of the seven-year itch.

This ain't a great comedy - it's probably too long and a couple of issues could have been ironed out a little neater.  But as long as you don't let yourself get distracted by the pro-choice/pro-life politics some have injected into this film, you're going to have a great time with this movie.",1209168000,,2038,4.606648199445983

Then, to top it off, once she finds out she is pregnant, actually hunts him down and forces him to part of her world and adapts pretty well to his. Not funny. Not fun.",1208736000,2,537,4.8478260869565215
2912546,1,B000TZJBP6,"I guess the soulless scourge who find the lowbrow-humor movie, Knocked Up, ""funny"" also find bringing kids out of wedlock (called bastardized kids) into the world ""funny!!!!"" Knocked Up's premise--if you can call it that, which you cannot since it's more like a relentless running gag of p*rversity loaded with excess immaturity--is that a couple of liberal, young adults artificially coerce one another into a relationship after she gets pregnant in their heartless and thoughtless one-night stand, a one-night stand which refuses to take into consideration that sex is primarily for procreation, not hedonism.

Again, you can tell that liberals had their reactionary, little paws all over the script of this obscene film because it encourages sex out of lust and drunkenness, premarital sex, viewing babies as the mere, annoying side-effect of copulation, and birthing b*stard kids. The concern here is, obviously, unless you have no moral integrity to speak of, that young people and teens will be disadvantageously influenced to copy this misbehavior in real life because they misguidedly think how ""cool"" it was depicted on screen. Declining marriage rates and out-of-wedlock births are no laughing matter as the US government in 2006--as part of its census figures--reported that the rate of out-of-wedlock births was around 40%!!!! This film callously spits in the eye of said b*stard kids who are growing up without either Mommy or Daddy in their lives.

This is an R-rated movie, so right there one knows how infectious most of its material-fronting-as-humor will be; the tragedy with many R-rated movies is that they're marketed to teens who aren't allowed to see the sm*t-movie under the ratings system. If there are ANY parents (not in their right mind) out there reading this who have the nerve to permit their teens to see this showcase of lewdness and lowness, I'm going to shame you into reversing your decision by citing all the ethical breaches Knocked-Up perpetrates.

In order to determine whether a movie will have content in it which will degrade my character--impurity like excessive sex, violence, swearing, drug use, etc..--I consult the parent-friendly website called Screen It, which lists moral affronts in movies to determine their admissibility for young people. Knocked-Up fails on all counts!!!!

For instance, remember the depraved scene-disguised-as-humor when we see Ben's pimply rear end after he and Allison ""got busy?"" Kids and teens don't need to see the obese, hairy rears of fat guys like Seth Rogan, and this is after the enormously suggestive scene immediately preceding it. To show the depraved one-night stand, the liberal writers gloatingly and asininely showed Ben and Allison rushing to copulation without putting on condoms!!!! The ethical affronts aside, this movie glorifies dangerous sexual malpractice in this day and age of rampant STDs.

Or how about the infamous scene indulging in the foulest of unsanitary ""jokes"": the scene when Ben and his lib-buddies get an e-mail from Allison demanding to talk to him, one of his lib-buddies blurts that Allison liked the way Ben's you-know-what tasted. Not happy with this profaning of the storyline via suggestiveness, the writers ensure the sm*t is imposed on everyone watching when Ben takes Jason's head and does mock oral sex thrusting on it!!!!

Not content with offending societal mores with immoderate ""jokes"" (read: obscenities) about sex, Knocked-Up's also got lots of toxic examples of poisonous incivility. Some infamous examples are: when Debbie and Allison aren't allowed into a club by the doorman, they demean him as a fu**ing, little fa**t (so much for the lie that libs are tolerant of g*ys); the misjudging, liberal writers assumed it'd be funny to jeer at people in wheelchairs who suffer from Lou Gherig's disease, as when Jay imitates a synthesized voice in a wheelchair in the hospital; and one of Ben's lib-buddies advises that Allison should get a murderous abortion (sm-smorshin in the lib movie's ""cool"" lingo!), which even ends in a child-sodomizing ""joke!!!!""

After all these cultural, ethical and societal trespasses, I cannot think of any parent who wants their teen to see this pollution disguised as a movie--unless, of course, the parent is liberal and not into drawing moral boundaries. Additionally, even if you're an adult, you should spare yourself from enduring this indecency imitating entertainment because it will harden you to values in life and lower your principles. The falsehood the apologists of this film use--that it's ""only"" entertainment--isn't defensible if you become degraded as a result of watching this coarse film.

To recap, my review utterly confirms that Knocked Up is 100% a raw excuse for entertainment which ridicules invalids, healthy sexual relationships, matrimony, fidelity and basic civility. Thanks to all the moral relativists who patronize this filth, it can also conceal all these societal breaches by falsifying it's only a comedy.

2912549,4,B000TZJBP6,"After seeing Judd Apatow's hilarious smash comedy ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and hearing the great things about his follow-up movie, ""Knocked Up"", I looked forward to getting a chance to sit down and watch it. However, I seemed to never get around to watching ""Knocked Up"", the movie that many called `the best comedy of 2007', so I eventually just forgot all about it. That is until my wife and I caught the trailer on TV recently and we finally decided to go rent the movie and see if it could live up to all the hype that had been bestowed upon it since its release last year.

""Knocked Up"" tells the story of Ben (Seth Rogen), a slacker who has nothing more on his mind than hanging out with friends and having a good time, and Alison (Katherine Heigl), a career woman who longs for bigger and better things to come so long as she can stay focused on the path she's set herself upon. Then, after an intoxicated one night stand, and two months and countless pregnancy tests later, Alison and Ben find themselves in for the surprise of their lives as they must prepare themselves to welcome a new bouncing bundle of joy into their world. Now these two complete opposites are trying to get to know each other and begin a relationship, figure out what they need for the baby, and above all else how to become two mature, responsible parents.

Well, I guess the question is, did ""Knocked Up"" live up to all the hype that moviegoers built up around it, or was the weight of it all too much for it to handle? I would have to say that the movie successfully lived up to the hype with relative ease, as my wife and I laughed aloud numerous times throughout the movie, and easily enjoyed every minute of it. The story for ""Knocked Up"" was hilarious, often times crude, and surprisingly heartfelt several times throughout the movie. I liked that the story didn't solely rely on sight gags to get the laughs, it featured a smartly written script that was chock full of hilarious one-liners, and uncomfortable yet hilarious situations that can occur throughout pregnancy and child birth. Kudos to Judd Apatow for delivering a solid script that was not only incredibly funny, but was also serious at times to break up the proceedings without being too overly dramatic to distract from the fact that it was still a comedy. Some comedy writers are too scared to try for any actual drama within their story, which is fine as well; while others try to fit it in but fail to make the various elements gel properly. Which is what makes Judd such a great writer is that he knows how to make each of the components of his story work well with each other and seem natural within the overall movie.

The cast was hilarious and fully capable of handling anything Judd Apatow's script could throw at them, and each created such fun and engaging characters that there was never a dull moment in the movie. Seth Rogen's (""The 40 Year Old Virgin"") character of Ben was hilarious as we get to see how uncomfortable he is around kids, yet over time he matures into a more responsible adult who is essentially ready to do what is necessary as a parent to a newborn child. Katherine Heigl (TV's ""Grey's Anatomy"") brought a more serious character with Alison to balance out Ben's more outlandish behavior, though she wasn't without her moments of hilarity as well. Even though her character was much more mature from the start, she still had her own arc that took her from career-minded woman to a pregnant woman full of uncontrollable hormones who is struggling to keep her sanity amidst a somewhat dim-witted boyfriend, a controlling sister, and a job where her looks define her success, and eventually into a woman ready to welcome a child into the world with the man she loves, no matter how mismatched they may be. The supporting cast led by Paul Rudd (""40 Year Old Virgin""), Leslie Mann (""Drillbit Taylor""), and Jonah Hill (""Superbad"") were hilarious and made their characters just as memorable as the two leads. Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann's married characters of Pete and Debbie were a possible glimpse into what the future held for Ben and Alison, which was a nice way to show the do's and don'ts of parenting and marriage. Jonah Hill was absolutely hilarious as the outspoken and opinionated Jonah, who is one of Ben's many slacker friends. Turning up in surprising cameos are actor/director Harold Ramis (""Analyze This"") and Joanna Kerns (TV's ""Growing Pains"") as Ben's dad and Alison's mom, I guess this just shows that a Judd Apatow movie will attract all different types of talent, so you never know what to expect.

""Knocked Up"" is a hilarious, laugh out loud movie that easily lives up to the hype surrounding it, and did not disappoint in the least. I highly recommend watching ""Knocked Up"" if you're a fan of Judd Apatow or if you are a person who is not easily offended and is looking for a hilarious comedy that will keep you laughing from start to finish.

The plot has elements of both comedy and drama making it rather difficult to label it as one or the other; it's actually a bit of both.

Seth Rogen is not likable in the leading role and his kissing Katherine Heigl is actually revolting, even when then movie attempts to portray it as cute.
Paul Rudd is almost unrecognizable as he looks like a POW straight out of a Viet Cong prison camp. He looks terrible.
The supporting cast seem to be out of place and in need of acting lessons.
On a positive note Katherine Heigl and Leslie Mann (both of whom are GORGEOUS!), stay afloat and seem to have great potential, so let's see more of them in the future.
The dialogues, for which the writers are to blame, are truly pathetic and are to a great extent behind the overall mediocrity.

I'm not the most prudish person, but the near-constant use of the F-word and other profanity annoyed me to no end and was very distracting. Did they not know other words to use? And the sex scenes were just disgusting and, as one reviewer said, pitiable. Yeah, let's have an attractive, upwardly mobile woman sleep with and do her best to fall in love with a guy who is unemployed, unattractive, pudgy, lazy, disrespectful, foul-mouthed, smokes pot all the time, has his face in a stripper's derrier near the end, is often quite mean to the woman, and created an Internet porn site...THAT'S realistic for an attractive woman whose career is on the upswing!

2912570,4,B000TZJBP6,"So much of the reputation of Knocked Up concerns its oftentimes juvenile sensibility.  This standing is not without cause, as the film is littered with jokes bout flatulence, websites devoted to nudity in movies and endless misogynistic and homophobic humor.  But somewhere lost in the cultural dialogue of this film is its heart, which focuses on two young people propelled into a situation neither is ready to tackle, but who are both seemingly motivated by good intentions and a desire to make the situation work.

The young adults are the mismatched pair Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) and Ben Stone (Seth Rogen).  Scott is an up-and-coming assistant to Ryan Seacrest (in a great role where he lampoons himself), and Stone is a slacker who has parlayed a small settlement in a traffic accident into a life where he can sleep all day, smoke pot with his friends and dream about a huge payday earned from building the Mecca of adult websites. .

Despite his lack of goals, money, good looks or social qualms, there's something just boyish and rascally about Stone that allows him to one night hit the beer goggle jackpot when he somehow finds himself in Scotts bed.  The two part ways, never expecting to see each other again, until the morning sickness comes a-knocking and Scott learns her one night of drunken decadence produced a spawn.

The difficulties and joyous anticipation leading up the birth account for the meat of Knocked Up, as the two  attempt to find common ground and really want to love each other.  From it's packaging and considering the film is the product of the minds behind The 40-Year Old Virgin, the laughs were to expected, but the touching life journey is a surprise.  Writer/Director Judd Apatow hit's the magical formula of appealing both to the funny bone of vulgar young boys and to the Kleenex-taxing desires of middle-aged women.",1200787200,11,1866,4.8765822784810124

Someone, if sober, she'd talked to in a bar because she is nice but not have sex with immediately. But she is (drunk) & they do.

I watched the movie for one reason - to see Ms. Heigl.  I have been impressed with her in ""Roswell"" and ""Grey's Anatomy"" and hoped against hope that she would have a breakout role in this film in some form or fashion.  How disappointing; surely Hollywood is offering her better and more redeeming roles than this?

This film is very entertaining but it also reveals a great deal about our contemporary love relationships. The interaction between the married couple--Alison Scott's sister and her husband--is ingloriously reflective of many of the relationships that I've observed. Their strained and unique bond will hit home with viewers. It's a situation that many of us find ourselves in nowadays. On the upside for future renters or purchasers, Knocked Up will definitely appeal to both men and women, but its real value lies in its refusal to bow down to political correctness when evaluating the state of romance.

2912596,1,B000TZJBP6,"I had huge expectations for this movie - always a bad idea going into any movie!  I had really enjoyed the 40 Year Old Virgin, Apatow's previous movie, which was original, very funny, and chock full of interesting characters.  In addition, ""Knocked Up"" was the best-reviewed comedy of the year, garnering all manner of great reviews by actual professionals.

But only 30 minutes into this movie, my wife and I were already bored with ""Knocked Up.""  It's bad enough that the premise is simply unbelievable: that when hot women go to the bar, and one has to go home, she would leave the other to hang out with a scruffy, pudgy loser who later has sex with her.  Please.  I can suspend my disbelief about terminators and aliens more easily.  Then, the slow, slow pacing begins, with tiny comedy nuggets scattered few and far between.  I wanted something different, something uproarious, something fun.  Instead, what I got was hoary, cliched gender role comedy with cliched, one-dimensional, unlikeable characters.  ""Everyone Loves Raymond"" for the big screen, if you will.  And as the movie drags on, the comedy actually gets less frequent and less funny!  We actually had to fast forward through parts to make this bearable.

The characters are unlikeable, from Rogen and Heigl's characters on down.  Even those two are hard to spend time with; he's a stoner loser with no verbal filter and she's a nascent control freak with serious dependency problems.

On the plus side, the performances are great, and there are some truly hysterical bits, sadly few and far between.

Perhaps part of the problem is that I saw the unrated movie with extra material.  I don't know how much extra material there is.  If 10-20 minutes of new footage was inserted into the theatrical release length movie, that would explain why this movie drags at such a slow pace.

If you think ""Everyone Loves Raymond"" is the most brilliant TV show of the last 20 years, you will love ""Knocked Up"", and you will be happy with it if you buy it blind.  If you hate Raymond, or don't even know who he is, rent this before you waste your money.",1198022400,22,2109,4.726027397260274

2912598,1,B000TZJBP6,"I just got my new HD DVD player and this was the first movie I watched. Thank GOD it was free and yet I still feel ripped off. I was just really unimpressed. Yes, there are some funny moments in this movie, but nowhere near what I expected there to be.

The movie kind of rolls pretty slow in the beginning. I guess that is due to the fact that you know there is a hookup coming but they still have to get there. Unfortunately for the viewer this is painful. I also just never got the feeling that this was very realistic. Yes, I know that it is a movie, but like other reviewers you just never get the feeling that 1) this girl and this guy would hook up regardless of the alcohol involved, and 2) that there really exists a pack of losers like the guys in the film that actually exist in such sordid stupidity (Note: They probably exist but I doubt they are all living together in one place, at least I hope not).

I do not agree that this is a pro-life movie. Think about it, does Hollywood often come out with movies that represent a conservative point of view? They were making a movie and it would have been a very short film if they decided to have an abortion. Also, they never seemed to delve into the real issues one might consider in this situation. So, if you are worried that it is a political statement movie, I just do not share that view.

Films filled with fart jokes, pop culture references, imagined sexual prowess stories and typical guy toilet humour doesn't really do it for me. But this film was a pleasant surprise. While it still has all of that guy stuff in it...it's done in a fairly clever and inoffensive way.

It's clearly a film made by a man, but what's good about it is that women can watch it too and not feel like they're being degraded or just being used as props. And while most men run for the hills when told about a film that has anything to do with child birth, I think they'll happily sit through this one and possibly even be ever so slightly moved. OK maybe they won't give a damn about the baby stuff, but that really is only a small part of it.

I genuinely think both men and women will warm to both lead characters despite their obvious flaws. Great casting, good script and the first film I've laughed out loud in for about a year.

I do think it is a bit funny that a movie like this that can talk about anything and everything from pot smoking to sex while pregnant, is afraid to show a bed scene with people who are naked. Did you notice that Katherine Heigl was clothed in all the sex scenes ? This appears to be where we are in the U.S. in 2007: we have a childish ""need"" to talk about sex, but god-forbid we really show it in an adult way. A European movie (French) would have been much different in that regard. What are we Americans afraid of ? Will seeing a breast destroy us ?

BTW, the characters are Jewish, mostly. Do they realize that by the main character having a kid with a non-Jewish woman, all his progeny from then on will be non-Jews ? Just wondering. That was not addressed in the movie, but in real life, it would have been big (for the guys' dad, for instance).

Because Alison wants to celebrate, and Ben has very little else to do, they both happen upon the same club...and worlds collide.

After the drinks, funny comments, and beer goggles set in for Alison, the hook up becomes inevitable.  They both end up at Alison's place where Ben misinterprets Alison's wishes and ignores the use of protection.  Hello unplanned pregnancy!

The rest devolves into half-comedy, half-romance film in which there is just raunchy slapstick for the guys, and just enough hand-holding for the women.  It's a win-win sitution for all.  Mutual support and responsibility takes hold, and each person does what they need to do in order to take care of the baby.

Despite the humor, and overall good times provided by the movie, the one unbelieveable part of the movie itself is the eventual affection shown between the two once they realize they are going to soon become parents.  Just like television shows like ""King of Queens"", ""Everybody Loves Raymond"", ""Yes Dear"", and ""Still Standing"", the one-night stand is believeable, but the relationship afterwards is far-fetched.

Bonus points go to the cast which includes Paul Rudd.  It's easier to get into a movie and get ready for laughs when you know the same consistent crew from previous good movies will be delivering the same performances.  And, believe me, the cast delivers enough to make anyone laugh.

I highly recommend this to just about everyone.",1196985600,,1844,4.919093851132686
2912606,3,B000TZJBP6,"When I found out that Seth Rogen (""Forty-Year-Old Virgin,"" ""Freaks and Geeks"") would be headlining a comedy with the gorgeous Katherine Heigl (""Grey's Anatomy,"" ""Roswell,"" ""Just Bring It""), I knew it would be comedic gold.  Instead, ""Knocked Up,"" directed by ""Forty-Year-Old Virgin"" navigator, Judd Apatow, is a dull comedy with only flashes of brilliance from Apatow and Rogan's previous outing.  In ""Knocked Up,"" Heigl plays Alison, an up-and-comer at E! Entertainment Television who goes out on the town with her sister (Leslie Mann) to celebrate her recent promotion.  While out, Alison runs into uber-pothead/loser/internet porn entrepreneur, Ben (Rogen) and his gaggle of geeky friends.  In true drunken fashion, the pair end up consummating their brief encounter with a little intercourse.  When Alison wakes up and sees what's lying next to her, she immediately tries her best to put as much distance between her and Ben as possible.  Unfortunately for her and Ben, however, she's pregnant.  The rest of the story is a thin and obvious plot of the pair arguing, hating each other, doubting their forced relationship and eventually falling for each other.  Ben has to prove that he's a responsible man.  Alison has to learn to trust him.  They both have to grow up a bit.

Along the way there's a subplot of Rogen's geeky friends trying to start up a webpage listing the play time into a film in which certain actresses appear in varying degrees of nudity.  There's another subplot in which Alison's sister and her husband (Paul Rudd, also of ""Forty-Year-Old Virgin"") are at odds with one another.

The whole film just feels like a jumbled mess of pop culture references (which grow tiring after awhile) and a dull romance that weighs down the film even more.  Rogen and Heigl are not believeable as a couple (even in the comedic sense) and their respective friends (all of which are from the Apatow stable) wear thin on the viewer.

In short, don't watch ""Knocked Up"" hoping for another ""Virgin.""  This film, while it has its moments, is not up to par with it's elder brother.  The dull moments far outweigh the funny ones and for that reason I have to give ""Knocked Up"" three stars.",1196899200,3,2191,4.9103260869565215

2912609,1,B000TZJBP6,"This movie was a HUGE disappointment. It was just like so many other formulaic Hollywood movies. All the kiddies viewing it will think that it's all ""cutting edge"" and exciting because bongs and eff words are used throughout. But pleeaaase! Who cares anymore? The spoilt, selfish, self-pitying lead characters were completely insincere and lame. Why should the world care whether any of them lived, died , aborted or continued to breed?

The tendency to try to mix humor with sentimentality in this kind of Hollywood trash is so infuriating.  Last thing I need is for a comedy to be taking itself all serious and implying that abortion is sinful, that men are somehow bad and ""insufferably irresponsible"", and that I should care about the sad married life of spoilt rich Hollywood Americans. How aggravating! How BORING!

The conventionality and political correctness of this movie amazes! Take nudity for example. The odd boob or two is flashed by some of the extras, but during two sex scenes do you think the leading woman shows her boobs? Oh no - she's too virtuous for that - her bra stays firmly in place throughout. How coy!!! How completely coy and silly!!! The only thing remotely new or potentially comical about this movie was the ""crowning"" during the delivery, but any laughs there were predictably stomped out by the absolutely abysmal, awkward, stupidly self-conscious acting.  A total waste of time and money - worst movie of the year, easily.",1196640000,7,1459,4.942857142857143

2912611,3,B000TZJBP6,"There are a few funny moments in Knocked Up, but most of this movie consists of a thin, obvious plot pulled apart by conflicting tones.  The director (Judd Apatow) seems unable to decide if he wanted to write a chick flick or a fun-to-quote, man-friendly comedy.  Faced with a decision, Apatow has slammed together Beerfest and Pretty Woman, and the result isn't nearly as successful as his similarly constructed film, The 40 Year Old Virgin.

Most of the problem has to do with the film's editing.  I did not see the theatrical release, but the unrated version is overly long, bloated, and some of the editing decisions were quite poor (some of the ""deleted scenes"" would have enhanced the movie, for example).  Because the film is largely improvised, there's an amateurish quality to much of the dialogue.  It's not quite random, but it is rambling and at times nonsensical, irrelevant, and worse, not funny.

But there are some redeeming qualities to the film.  Even though they are uneven and sound forced, some of the ""serious"" discussions about relationships and responsibility are actually quite good and heartfelt.  It's too bad that the spell of sentiment will then be broken by a fart joke or a random act of cruelty.  Also, the problems that couples have in the film do seem real, which is rare in comedies.  However, the resolutions to those problems aren't particularly believable given what the audience knows about the characters in the film.

I think Knocked Up would have worked better as a dark comedy.  The problem with that is, no one would want to see it.  It would be too depressing and mean, which is funny to me and perhaps a few others, but not the date-movie masses.

Knocked Up is a decent rental, but I don't recommend buying it.  Try to avoid the unrated version unless you enjoy redundancy.  I wish I had sought out the theatrical release.  There are a few good laughs from time to time, but like so many movies lately, you've seen it before, and it was better the first time.",1196553600,4,2006,4.699140401146132

Add to the fact that Ben was not the least bit funny made it worse.  Usually in these cookie-cutter films, the sidekicks steal the show.  Not in this case.  What a bad combo, a boring/bad fit leading man whose buddies were NOT even 1% funny!  Ugh!  What a waste of time.

2912618,5,B000TZJBP6,"I've been a fan of Director/Writer, Jud Apatow's work since the original run of his (criminally) underappreciated NBC TV comedy, ""Freaks & Geeks"". Since then he had the feature film, mega-hit ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", which basically made comedian, Steve Carell a full fledged star. Apatow now continues his streak of creating uproarious comedy, that has heart, with his latest release, ""Knocked Up"".

""Knocked Up"" is a film about two very different characters, who normally, would probably have very little to do with each other. Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) is in her early twenties, tall, blonde and beautiful. She sort of looks like a ""Barbie doll"" come to life. On top of that, she's smart, motivated and her begining career at ""The E-Channel"" is on the rise. Ben Stone (Seth Rogan) is also in his early twenties. He's somewhat over-weight, has a mop of curley hair and seems to sport a permanent, five O'clock shadow. He sort of looks like a young Jewish, John Belushi. Ben is also smart, but totally unmotivated with no real job or prospects. His main interest seems to be hanging out with his roommates, shooting the breeze about porn and getting really stoned.

One night at a club these two meet. Through hormones, lots of alcohol and a misunderstanding about a condom, they suddenly have something in common. Alison's pregnant. This is a story of two very different people, who initially are together because of their circumstances, but go on to find out, that they  might actually like and care about each other. But is it enough stay in a relationship? Is it enough to form a family? Are people willing to make commitments and change their lives for each other? Thats what this movie looks at.

What makes this movie so good is Apatow's excellent story and dialogue. The subject matter could easily have been turned into malk-ish, standard Hollywood mush. Instead Apatow keeps things real. His characters often voice, what we often think about relationships, but dare not speak. The hilarious, gutt-busting dialogue (which I'm sure a lot is improvised) can be crude, rude & lewd, but most of it (if you agree with it or not) seems to have a grain a truth to it.

The film's cast is wonderful. Seth Rogan & Katherine Heigel give fantastic performances really making us want to root for these disperate characters to stay together. The rest of the cast, like-wise does an excellent job. Many of them are veterens of previous Apatow productions including Jason Segel, Martin Starr, Leslie Mann, Paul Rudd, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill ETC. You might not know them by name, but you will recognize the faces. Also look for cameos from Jessica Alba, Steve Carell, Andy Dick, James Franco, Eva Mendes and a hilariously b**chy turn from Ryan Seacrest!

Finally, I want to mention that their are two different versions of this DVD release. There is a plain 1-disc version and a 2-disc ""Collector's Edition"". By all means, spend the extra cash and go for the ""Collector's Edition"". Its just brimming with over 3 hours of extras, much of it being deleted scenes, outtakes and extended scenes, that in many cases are even funnier, then what eventually ended up in the movie. I laughed my a** off! You will not be sorry. Get the 2-disc ""Collector's Edition"". Great movie! Highly recommended!",1196380800,,3289,4.853832442067736

2912620,5,B000TZJBP6,"This is the story of a very irresponsible young man and a slightly less irresponsible young lady who cast their inhibitions and common sense to the wind one night, then discover...well, you can guess.  For those looking for a comedy, there's lots of laughs, including some humor that's over the top (at least in the unrated version).  It's also a great ""coming of age"" movie for post-adolescents, a sort of bildungsroman for adults.  Because of its adult themes and constant demonstration of drug use, it's not a movie to take the kids to see, but if you're in your twenties or thirties, it's perfect.

One part of the movie puzzled me at first: the scenes where Alison Scott decides to keep the baby instead of having an abortion.  Looked at one way, it's totally logical for an irreligious person as Ms Scott appears to be to have an abortion rather than risk her career and her chance at having a family more of her choosing.  The first time I saw the movie, I thought it wasn't being honest on this point.  When I saw it the second time, however, I came to a different conclusion.  Judd Apatow (the writer) went as far as he could in a mainstream movie to say that abortion for convenience is wrong.  What captured this sentiment was Ms Scott's conversation with her mother, where her mom, a product of the Sixties no doubt, blithely states that an acquaintance, after having an abortion, later got married ""and now she has a real baby.""

In short: it's an entertaining, light-hearted and sometimes thought-provoking movie.",1196208000,,1527,4.685393258426966
2912621,3,B000TZJBP6,"A beautiful reporter for E! is out celebrating a promotion when she meets Ben, a slacker stoner. They talk and drink and by the end of the night are drunk and sleep together. Weeks later she discovers she's pregnant. She decides to reconnect with Ben to see if they can make a relationship work for the sake of the child. He has to deal with her controlling sister and depressed brother-in-law while she has to deal with his four idiot, jobless roommates.

Seth Rogen and Katharine Heigl are both good in their roles because they almost make you believe their characters could actually fall in love. In reality this is doubtful since she is smart, driven and dedicated while he's obnoxious, smokes pot, takes mushrooms, has no job and seems to care about very little. I know opposites supposedly attract, but these two are a little too far apart to be realistic.

What is realistic is the difficulty of making a relationship work, the blending of family and friends and the highs and lows of pregnancy. Judd Apatow's movies have a sweetness underneath that counterbalances all the rough language and dirty humor. It's a bizarre mixture that he somehow makes work, although I didn't find Knocked Up as funny as The 40 Year Old Virgin. Ben's friends provide laughs at times and at others are just so pathetic. The movie is also way too long for a comedy, there aren't enough laughs to sustain an over 2 hour runtime.

Knocked Up is funny, but could have been better. The humor is filthy and the F-bombs fly freely so be forewarned, although with a title like Knocked Up, I'm not sure what else you would expect.",1196035200,,1609,4.63859649122807
2912622,1,B000TZJBP6,"Man and I thought Bloodrayne was the worst movie ever!  That one is an Oscar contender compared to this one.... well, maybe not, that one sucked too.

I have decided to expound on my review based on a comment I received about it.  I said the movie sucked, and now I will explain why.

I tried to listen to the director's commentary before watching the film and I could not get through 20 minutes of it.  About 3 minutes into the commentary the lead actor (Seth Rogen) makes a totally disgusting pedophile joke, guess what folks, that guy wasn't acting, he really is that stupid.  After the 20 minutes of torture (listening to a bunch of silly men giggling and guffawing half the time) I decided to watch the movie because of the rave reviews it had received.  To my dismay I then find that the movie itself has a pedophile joke.  These two reasons alone were enough for me to regret ever renting the movie.

The foul language was very distracting and the directors basically had the actors improvise the entire movie - which explains a whole lot.  Few people were actually acting.  The director himself said in the commentary that most of the script was improvised.  A movie that had such great potential is nothing more than these people being themselves, which makes me glad that they live on the other side of the country from me.

Katherine Heigl's character was so oblivious to Ben's glaring flaws that it is no wonder some women make such dumb choices in men.  Let's look at one particular scene, where she tells Ben that she is pregnant.  So they are sitting in a restaurant and Ben's character begins to talk very loudly without any regard to the obscenities that he was uttering in a restaurant filled with people that just ignored him.  No one even glanced his way or said a thing.  She herself just ignored that behavior as they did.  He then goes on to explain what he does for a living and she just brushes that off?  Did she find his job ""amusing"" or ""cute""?  Sure it made it seem as if she was uncomfortable by it, but did that stop her from talking to him afterward?  No.

It can be argued that she did find it amusing and cute, as some women do.  Maybe his obscenities are something that she herself uses all of the time and is therefore not bothered by it.  I mean there are women that are swingers and such sexual talk probably wouldn't bother them, but does that make any of that funny?  As I mentioned in my reply to a comment, do you always laugh at laugh cues when you watch a sitcom?  Laugh cues are inserted each and every single time that a ""joke"" is uttered.  Does the laugh make it funny, is the joke funny?  Not necessarily.  Obscenities and lewd behavior can be funny, when done with intelligence.  What intelligence was there in this movie?

If you find this junk funny then there should be no wonder why the divorce rate is what it is.  Or that America is becoming more and ruder as time goes by.

Seriously, if you are looking for some kind of romantic comedy that actually makes you believe in the characters and that they are decent people, and then this movie is not for you.  Some of you want to find a really good comedy that you can sit with your wife or girlfriend and enjoy.  Something that is uplifting without having to be embarrassed at every turn because you chose something that had rave reviews and it must therefore be a good movie.  Thus I am so grateful for websites and Amazon and enabling us to write our reviews and warn others to keep away from putrid garbage like this.

I like the whole idea of having a site that can tell you when and how long starts with the whole nudity thing in a movie and locating it on site...too bad they were a bit slow on that idea though.  Obviously the movie involves 2 people Seth and Katherine's characters getting together after a night of over drinking and seriously bad dancing by Seth (with the whole Andrew Dice Clay thing going a bit too much) as one of the characters states in the movie.

He and she get together and well its not really a bad thing when you mix sex & alcohol.  It does however impair the judgement (ie just do it) he does it without any protection and she gets pregnant.  It goes through them being freaked out about the baby to them all in love with each other to them going at each other when she's getting a check up. It was intense in that one.

Most of those dissenting reviewers probably only saw the movie because it has such a strong buzz among the college crowds and is one of the few comedies with glowing reviews among the more 'intellectual' film critics.  I'm sure they were suspecting more of the subtle, dry humour popular in most of the (often pseudo-intellectual) indie/art house movies.

'Knocked-Up' is a classic Apatow comedy.  Youthful in its approach, it has both the graphic, cutting (sometimes gross) humor and the innocent, self-conscious, honest heart of adolesence.

2912633,2,B000TZJBP6,"Hollywood films have a peculiar relationship with the institution of marriage.  On the one hand, it is depicted as lifeless and loveless, as without any inherent interest or dramatic tension.  On the other hand, it is shown to be that towards which every self-absorbed or driven man and woman is ultimately destined, and as their only possible means of redemption from all of the stupid and insensitive things they do, and from the ambitions that lead only to loneliness and isolation.  These days, Hollywood filmmakers don't usually go as far as ending in a church or to the ringing of wedding bells, but they clearly depict the idea that a woman is incomplete without her man (and vice-versa).  Knocked up takes the formula -- of trashing marriage and family only to later reaffirm its legitimacy and importance -- to the extreme.

Ben is an extreme slacker (who has absolutely no internal censor telling him which thoughts to speak out loud and which to keep to himself), an illegal alien from Canada, who has no real job and spends his days goofing off with his buddies, smoking pot and creating a celebrity nudity website (an idea that, unfortunately for him, has already been taken).  Alison is an up and coming assistant and soon-to-be reporter for E! Entertainment, who is living with her sister and brother-in-law.  She goes out to celebrate her promotion, gets drunk and meets him, and nature takes its course.  It takes about five minutes for her to decide to keep the baby and for him to decide he likes that idea -- and all of a sudden this totally mismatched pair is trying to make a relationship work for the sake of the baby.  The filmmakers try to make plausible this match between a go-getter highly driven reporter and this lovable loser by establishing a heavy handed comparison with Alison's brother-in-law.  The only difference between the successful in-law and the pothead Ben, really, is that the in-law has a better job and a bit of money and a greater ability to keep his bad habits hidden from his wife.  I guess what Ben has going for him is a complete and utter lack of shame (that passes for a kind of admirable and sweet honesty).

Needless to say, Ben will prove himself worthy of fatherhood -- by reading a few parenting books and inexplicably getting a nice job and an apartment and a nursery full of cool stuff purchased on credit (which is really strange since he's an illegal alien who hasn't had any prior credit and only just got a job).  I don't think that gives the plot away because it was virtually guaranteed from the beginning.  The message: underneath every socially irresponsible and foul-mouthed pothead prankster (with a heart of gold) is a good father just waiting to emerge -- that is, as long as he's white and middle-classed and able to get a great job and lots of credit without much trouble on his own part.

Is it funny?  Yes, I guess, every once in a while -- but most of the humor is of the ""I can't believe someone would actually say that"" sort that elicits uncomfortable chuckles.  The film would be considerably shortened if they just cut out the endless and repeated and usage without any real significance of a certain word that begins with the letter f.  Actually the humor in many instances reminded me most of the style of humor you get in a John Waters film -- but there John Waters uses discomfort as a way to tease the audience about their commitment to conventions of sexuality and expectations of middle class marital bliss that he finds either boring or crass.  Here, the discomfort ultimately finds its outlet and release in a reaffirmation of the institutions and conventions that the characters treat lightly in their words and actions.",1195516800,,3711,4.699074074074074

How could he be so great playing the sidekick in Freaks and Geeks or Undeclared, and yet here he's just this shallow mask mouthing lines with a grin?  On the other hand Katherine Heigl really impressed me and held the movie together.

My wife and I started watching it on a Monday and it took us four days to finish it up.  It isn't bad, just not very compelling  We wound up using any excuse to turn off the DVD, such as ""Is that the pizza guy at the door?"" or ""Do the cats look weird to you?""  Of course the movie had some really funny parts, but I didn't believe for an instant that the party boy Ben at the beginning could mature into the serious, employed paterfamilias at the end, yet he learns responsibility in about ten minutes.  Also it seemed like Jay, Jason, Martin, etc were all in the movie just so Judd could feel charitable, like Sinatra throwing Joey Bishop and Peter Lawford little parts in his UA movies.

2912639,4,B000TZJBP6,"KNOCKED UP has some of the funniest dialog and delivery you've probably ever seen in the past year. Although the plot is a bit contrived and unrealistic (the stoner dude with no ties would probably tuck tail and run when he found out about the pregnancy!), the acting is quite good with a cast that reflects the moral ambiguity of our times.

This is the story of a one-night-stand that never should have happened. The girl, Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) is sexy, funny, and successful. The boy, Ben Stone (Seth Rogen,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-40-Year-Old-Virgin/dp/B00005JNZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 40-Year-Old Virgin</a>) is a pot-smoking and frumpy loser with nearly pornographic ambitions.

The two unawares meet up at a hoppin' club and bump into one another at the bar. Alison has already had too much to drink and Ben is also well on his way. The two dance, chat, and eventually end up in bed, much to the chagrin of Alison come coyote morning. The two happily separate from one another and both think that is that. But a few weeks later, Alison's morning sickness kicks in. She and her sister Debbie (Leslie Mann,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bottle-Rocket/dp/0767821408/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bottle Rocket</a>) rush to the drug store and buy up every brand of pregnancy test they can find and, yep, that little red line shows up every time.

Alison and Ben are thrust back together in the name of impending parenthood. Alison quickly decides that abortion is out of the question; she wants a kid and is already getting ""older."" Forced to either accept the pregnancy or leave Alison and her unborn child to circumstances, Ben tries to form a bond with Alison, only to have multiple obstacles thrown in his path. First is his lifestyle. He lives with a bunch of stoners who's only wish is to create a website that focuses on female nudity. Ben's father (Harold Ramis,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ice-Harvest/dp/B000DZ7YN8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ice Harvest</a>, director) can't give much fatherly advice since he's a washed-up stoner, too. And Alison's sister Debbie doesn't really want him around.

Alison and Ben's on-again off-again relationship seems doomed. The two have nothing in common except the pregnancy and the audience is left (for a while) to wonder if Alison wouldn't be better off raising her child away from Ben anyway.

Eventually the fateful delivery day looms and Ben has set himself onto the path of fatherhood, moving himself away from his pot-smokin' days and buddies. Although Alison has shunned him, the two are forced back together again once Alison's labor begins and she has no way to get to the hospital. Rushing her through traffic, Ben gets her to the delivery suite and Alison and he are eventually united via the bonds of babydom.

The funniest parts of the film are surprisingly not between Heigl and Rogen, but instead between Rogen and Paul Rudd (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-at-the-Museum/dp/B000NOKJC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night at the Museum</a>), who plays Pete, Debbie's husband and Alison's brother-in-law, as they head to Vegas on a roadtrip after Debbie boots him out of the house and he finds solace with Ben. Their `shroom experience is absolutely fantastic and will probably have you wetting yourself (""There are five different kinds of chairs in this room."")

This is, without a doubt, director Judd Apatow's best film to date; it's even above&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-40-Year-Old-Virgin/dp/B00005JNZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 40-Year-Old Virgin</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anchorman/dp/B00005JMYI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anchorman</a>. But it is unrealistic. People as varied as Ben and Alison DO NOT get together. And even if they initially did, they certainly wouldn't stay so. That said, I will say that it was refreshing to not see two hunky actors in the prime roles. Although Katherine Heigl is a damn fine looking lady, there are other actresses that certainly look better. And Seth Rogen appears as a sloth, which was an interesting dichotomy within the sexual portions of the film.",1195084800,3,4395,5.922712933753943

2912641,4,B000TZJBP6,"Seth Rogen plays Ben Stone, a lazy stunted-adolescent leech who lives in the United States illegally with his band of loser pothead perverts.  Together they aspire to create the next Mr. Skin website devoted to informing other miscreants of their ilk about nude scenes in movies.  He is a pathetic loser and I had to really struggle to like him.  Katherine Heigl plays Alison, an ambitious entertainment journalist on the verge of mainstream success.  One of the early scenes involving her work includes a great self-parodying cameo by Ryan Seacrest.  Anyway, the two coincidentally meet one night at a bar and drink enough that Alison makes the mistake of spending the night with Stone and she gets pregnant.  We watch the characters develop in this normal and almost universally relative scenario.  Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann almost top the two leads in their performances as Allison's sister Debbie and her seemingly uninterested husband Pete.  It seems to me that Rudd just gets better and better with each supporting role.  Ben has a long way to go before he can deal with becoming a father and his transformation might have been in danger of not being a convincing one were it not for Rogen's subtly attached performance.  He really carries the film.

Anyway, Knocked Up had a lot of hype in a time of quality comedies.  It seems there are two sides that watch comedies.  One side is the stern critic that shuns pure slapstick and cheap humor and the other is the side that will gladly watch films like Billy Madison, Hot Rod, and Old School over and over again.  The stern critic in me accepts that Knocked Up is a halfway decent film even without all of the great humor but the other side in me sees the often outrageous humor in Knocked Up as its greatest strength.  It really does have some incredibly funny moments that make the often slow pace of the story much easier to drudge through.  It is overall a very enjoyable movie and seems shorter than its surprising length (over two hours).  I heard one critic say that Knocked Up is in bad need of an editor.  That's probably true and the pacing issues are the primary reason I won't give Knocked Up a perfect rating.

The film has some great cameos throughout and contains many of director Judd Apatow's (The 40 Year Old Virgin) regulars from his old television show Freaks and Geeks.  The cast is a surprisingly effective collaboration and the cameos are both effective and funny.  The humor never gets too stupid but there are times where it gets pretty close.

Likewise Seth Rogan's character's transition from being oblivious to how repellant she find him when meeting at the restaurant to being attentive to her every need is incomprehensible. There is a montage of Alison helping out with the guys' celebrity nudity website, seemingly conveying overcoming her hangups, so when she later breaks down over finding some drug paraphenalia it makes no sense.

Knocked Up may be hilariously funny or an overrated flop, depending on where you are in life.  For a teenager or college person, you may find it hilarious.  If you are middle aged, you may wonder what all the fuss is about.  F-bombs fall like so many raindrops on a stormy day.  Katherine Heigl is extremely easy on the eyes, one redeeming feature.  Still, at multiple levels the movie strains believability.

Heigl is so hot that it is hard to believe that, even drunk, she would hook up with a Neanderthal Fatboy like Seth Rogan.  Once pregnant, Heigl goes around town interviewing prospective obstetricians.  Ha!  Just try doing that under (or outside of) any HMO....  People live in nice homes in an expensive area of the country with little visible means of support,  The movie is overly long, with some extraneous sub-plots.

2912650,3,B000TZJBP6,"I'm still trying to sort out my feelings from my first viewing of ""Knocked Up,"" a few days ago.  I gave ""40 Year-old Virgin"" four stars, but if I were to review it again, I've upgrade that to five.  Judd Apatow directed and put his personal stamp all over both films.  ""Virgin"" was hilarious, and the comedy seemed to be non-stop.  But I saw ""Knocked Up"" as anything but a comedy.  It seemed odd, uneven, and mostly dramatic to me, with some funny lines and situations sprinkled in here and there.

The Alison Scott character represents pefection in a female love interest for jewish boys who not so secretly lust after tall, gorgeous, whistful, gentiles (shiksas).  (By the way, Director Apatow's real life wife, Leslie Mann, who did a nice job acting in this movie, also fits this image) OK fine. The great thing about Apatow is that he enjoys going where others fear to tread (i.e., ""Virgin."")

But in ""Knocked Up"" he goes way too far with Katherin Heigl's ""Alison Scott"" character. Yes, Heigl is perfect to look at in every way, but her Alison Scott is also smart, funny, nice, understanding, unattached with no baggage or critical friends, open-minded, mature, ambitious, sexy, interested in having sex (thats a big one for guys of all religions), and with the exception of a few minutes when she throws Seth Rogan out of the car in the middle of traffic, she spends the entire movie tirelessly searching for the tiny crumbs of redeeming characteristics in this friendly, but pathetic, ambitionless, and ugly slob pothead who got her pregnant.  In short, she's double, extra super perfect.  She might be the most desirable woman in the milky way galaxy. Making it too much of a stretch that she would persue a relationship with this man.

I asked my wife, ""Have you ever noticed that beautiful women always get paired with ugly guys?""  She said, ""Are you just noticing that now?""  I said, ""Does it piss you off?""  She said, ""Stop talking.  That home improvement show with the gorgeous yet unskilled carpenter is coming on now, and I want to be able to focus.""

Basically I found the entire movie to be completely unbelievable.  And this from a guy who had no problem believing Katherine Keener (another multi-attractive woman) could fall for a 40 year-old virgin. But ""Trish"" had faults that made her endearing and more believable as someone who might sacrifice alot in order to get a really nice guy (virgin).  Eventually I got rather pissed off at Apatow for thinking he could get me to buy into this situation.

And I'm forced to admit, with all due credit to my lovely wife, maybe I was pissed at Seth Rogan for copping such absolute perfection in a life partner as a result of... years of hard work?  But no!  By picking up a gorgeous drunk woman in a bar (a repeating Apatow theme) and having sex with her.

2912651,4,B000TZJBP6,"I know, I know - how does a God-fearing Christian woman (to whom the years are admittedly beginning to catch up) give a favorable, four-star review to a pro-drug movie like ""Knocked Up""?  I'll tell you the obvious answer:  it's one of the few mainstream pro-life movies to come out of Hollywood in a long while.  The movie has a clear message: own up to the adult responsibility of becoming pregnant by carrying the little rascal to term.  It may not seem ""convenient"" or financially feasible - but darn it, if you're going to get ""knocked up"" then you should accept the end result.

The less obvious answer is that the movie is pretty funny, regardless of whether you agree with it's agenda.  Seth Rogan is such a slob - but he manages to exude just enough charm and wit to (almost) believe a stone-cold beauty like Katherine Heigl would realistically consider spending the rest of her life with him.  They make an absolutely adorable couple.

Careful readers of my reviews (thank you and bless you) will note that I had a much lower opinion of the director's previous movie, ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"".  In retrospect I may have judged that earlier movie too harshly - having seen and appreciate Apatow's Christian message in ""Knocked Up"" I can see more clearly what he was trying to achieve with ""40 Year Old Virgin"".  I thought his ""wait til marriage to consumate a relationship"" message was merely a ruse - an easy way to milk cheap and unwarranted laughs out of someone's lack of intimate experiences.  Now I see that he apparently truly meant it, and for that I have to commend him.  I still think that one had too much stinky humor; ""Knocked Up"" has a more realistic approach to getting laughs.

My biggest problem, in the end, with ""Knocked Up"" is it's highly permissive attitude toward the use of illicit drugs.  Can I be frank?  I used to be an entertainment-industry professional, and I was around those kinds of substances ALL THE TIME.  Back in those days, before rehab clinics and treatment programs were all the rage (and in fact, were not all that encouraged even), I didn't believe substance abuse was really a big problem.  Seeing characters like the one played by Mr. Rogan and the roommates he lives with made my soul weep.

Kudos must be awarded to Judd Apatow for paving the way towards a better worldview.  This movie is still not what I would call ""church friendly"" - but darned if it wouldn't still be a great flick to watch with spiritual adults after the little ones have scurried off to bed.

That may seem unlikely, but it's not implausible.  The problem with the film is that much that occurs on the fringes of the plot really fall off the reality chart.  In one scene, presumably offering the newly pregnant Heigl a glimpse of marital reality, a wife (her sister in the film) enters a home expecting to find her husband having a torrid affair when, in fact, she catches him spending an evening with his pals playing fantasy football.  I am sure that thing happens all the time and I just don't know about it.  The same with a scene in Vegas where Seth and his fantasy football buddy get high on mushrooms and watch Cirrque de Solei (or whatever it's called).  I know the mushrooms felt cheated.

no surprises,  She also thought the prosthetic fake belly was obviously
fake.

I would agree with my wife on this one.  A waste of time.  Not very funny.

2912671,5,B000TZJBP6,"In this edition, the movie itself is almost unchanged from the theatrical release.  Unlike the 40 Year Old Virgin DVD, there are only a few undeleted or extended scenes so the pacing and mood remain the same.

The extras are way above average.  More than just the typical deleted and extended scenes (of which there are many), there are also behind the scenes documentaries and laugh out loud mockumentaries.  I had seen lots of material on the internet and was afraid this edition would simply be redundant.  Far from it, there is an abundance of new and hilarious stuff in here.

As usual, it's obvious why some of the deleted scenes were deleted.  Others are certainly funny enough to warrant your time.  A few are must-sees.

The documentaries focus on specific characters, actors, or events during shooting.  The editing and the subject matter are both good.  Even the director diaries are funny.

The mockumentaries are quite impressive.  They were obviously planned well before principal photography began, as they were filmed in parallel with the movie itself.  ""Finding Ben Stone"" shows various actors substituting Seth Rogen in scenes throughout the movie supposedly as auditions for the role.

Even the menus are nice.  Each one plays some deleted/extended scene, and not just ones already included elsewhere on the DVD.  For example, the language selection menu is nothing but clip after clip of just Seth Rogen laughing.  Great for all of us who think Seth Rogen is adorable.

The commentary track manages to be funny and avoid too much of the usual tedious banality.

All in all, this DVD is a great value.  Furthermore, it accomplishes something similar to the DVDs produced by Kevin Smith and Peter Jackson.  Aptow, Rogen, and crew come across as fascinating and funny film makers who are a pleasure to get to know better.",1193356800,,1838,4.937908496732026

Some of the scenes were a little graphic when the baby was born.  The father was a real loser and you wonder why the mother wants to give him a chance (he was living off an inheritance that had run out and had no ambition towards a job).  Also, his friends were quite annoying.

The only saving grace of the movie was the woman's sister and her own family struggles.",1193356800,,571,4.25
2912674,4,B000TZJBP6,"This comedy is about as casual and as laid back as a comedy can get.  I had no qualms watching KNOCKED UP in my underwear; heck, most of the cast is in their underwear (or less) throughout the duration of the film.  How laid back, you ask?  Well, consider this:  We are introduced to five maturity-challenged males, all living together (now that's a lot of socks on the floor).  Their goal, when they're not drunk or high, is to launch a celebrity skin website.  Talk about high aspirations.  But all is derailed when one of them, Ben (a disheveled Seth Rogen), gets lucky enough to score a one nightstand with Alison (Katherine Heigl), who is one hot babe; yet the result is an unplanned and unwanted pregnancy, throwing Ben and Alison together in a fragile relationship one can only call. . .tumultuous.

Rogen and Heigl are solid, and are backed by ""40-Year-Old Virgin"" vets Leslie Mann and Paul Ruud (who, as always, is hilarious); yet the scene stealers, time and time again, are Ben's grungy roommates (Jay, Jonah, Jason, and Martin).  When these guys get together to ad lib a scene, mayhem reigns supreme.  Alas, all the improvisation is also the movie's downside, as it tends to bog down the story and make it uncomfortably rough around the edges.  There's a sweet spot (Ben and Alison's budding love, and of course, a little baby) at the heart of this story; all the bloviating and spontaneous ranting makes it hard to reach it.

As this is the unrated two-disc collector's edition, we have extra features out the wazzoo:  Extended scenes, deleted scenes, video diaries--and way, way, too much of writer-producer Judd Apatow.  A must-see is a deleted scene featuring Jonah Hill going off on a rant over the film ""Brokeback Mountain""; another is an extended scene of the diminutive, yet feisty, Dr. Kuni (a real-life doc, by the way) taking charge of Alison's delivery.  That's some funny stuff, making this edition of KNOCKED UP fun to watch--even if you're just wearing underwear.

2912677,2,B000TZJBP6,"Alison (Katherine Heigl) gets pregnant after having a drunken one night stand with a guy named Ben (Seth Rogen). Alison's mother suggests she have an abortion. But, for reasons that are never made clear, Alison decides not only to have the baby but to contact Ben and ask him to become part of the baby's life. The idea is that these are two young people trying to be responsible and do the right thing. But this is totally inconsistent with their actions, as Ben continues to smoke pot on a daily basis and doesn't even bother to get a job until towards the very end of the movie and Alison seems completely OK with this. Even more absurd is that the movie shows Ben and Alison falling in love and even planning to get married. Yet the two have nothing in common and the idea that an up and coming career gal like Alison would go for a immature, unemployed slacker like Ben, especially while she is on the verge of motherhood, is nuts.

I was especially disappointed in this movie because it was written and directed by Judd Apatow. Apatow was the director of the short lived but brillant ""Freaks And Geeks"" TV show. In this great program the joys and fears of adolescence were intelligently and hilariously depicted through the lives of several Michigan high school kids circa 1980. These were the teen-age years as I, and many others, personally experienced them.

But both of Apatow's film efforts, ""Knocked Up"" and the only slightly better ""40 Year Old Virgin"", have been typically mediocre Hollwood comedies, needlessly vulgar and without enough laughs. To me it's a shame to see Apatow's obvious talent wasted on ""sell out"" schlock such as this.",1193270400,2,1652,4.673539518900344

Each was cancelled after a very short stint, it was a shame. That's what made the success of the 40 Year Old Virgin so great for me personally. This was his first big opportunity in film - some big movie stars (Steve Carell, Katherine Keener, Paul Rudd) - and wow did he give a slam dunk of a movie. An unbelievably hysterical movie, it will leave you laughing hours after you're done watching. It's one of the most quotable movies I can remember which also, I think, says more about the great one-liners and jokes in general. The humor is crafted in such a way that it isn't all stupid toilet humor, but intelligent, everyday life humor. The characters are lovable and we root for them. The movie meshed perfectly. So what would be of Apatow's second big time movie gig? I can't compare it to 40, that's like picking a favorite child. But it's my favorite movie of the year so far, and that's saying something. This movie has a lot of heart in it. Apatow and crew may joke around during interviews about how they aren't that good, but there's talks of an oscar nomination for best original screenplay. That's impressive. But getting back to the meat of the movie: it pulls you in from the opening sequence and never lets go until after the credits are done. Usually an action movie does that, but Knocked Up is hysterical, smart, and heartfelt. There are so many brilliant performances that fly under the radar, like from Jonah Hill. Simply put, Knocked Up is a modern day movie masterpiece. I can't wait for Apatow again!",1193097600,,1650,4.596610169491526

2912692,4,B000TZJBP6,"Knocked Up is the next in a string of hit movies by Judd Apatow and in true Apatow style the film is full of actors he has previously worked with on like the prematurely canceled shows Freaks and Geeks (Seth Rogan, Jason Segal, Martin Starr, and James Franco in a cameo), and Undeclared (Jay Baruchel, Seth Rogan) as well as his break out hit as writer, director, producer, The 40-Year-Old Virgin (Jonah Hill, Lesie Mann, Seth Rogan, Paul Rudd and Steve Carell in a cameo).

Rogan, in his fourth outing with Apatow, is promoted to leading man this time around as he wins the DNA lottery when he impregnates Katherine Heigl (My Father the Hero). Well at least they want you tom think this is a coup for Rogan, but as Token Hot Chicks go, Heigl is up there in the overrated category, along with Megan Fox in recent memory. But much like a Chicago Bears quarterback, she isn't there to win the game just not to lose it which she does for the most part (she have more that a few deer caught in the headlight look as some of them ad-lib which you can find in some of the deleted/extended scenes).

Instead Apatow regulars handle the brunt of the comedy load. Hill, Rogan and Rudd are on fire throughout the movie, which is pretty much the Dances with Wolves of comedies with a two plus hour running time (not to mention an extra hour of those deleted and extended scenes and three hours of features), but thanks to those three it rarely seems that long. Rogan and Rudd don't have an exchange as funny as their improve ""You know how I know you're gay"" routine from The 40 Year Old Virgin but Hill comes close as he explains why Brokeback Mountain is a horrible movie in a deleted scene while Heigl looks on with a why did I sign up for this movie look on her face.",1192492800,,1758,4.340425531914893

2912695,3,B000TZJBP6,"""Knocked Up"" is an attempt by writer/director Judd Apatow to build a sophisticated-but-potty-mouthed comedy around modern sexual mores and male-female relationships following his success in that vein with 2005's ""40-Year-Old Virgin"". This time, Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) is an ambitious young entertainment reporter, who celebrates her recent promotion by hitting a hip club with her uptight older sister Debbie (Leslie Mann). There, Alison gets drunk and picks up a mildly amusing, aimless pothead named Ben Stone (Seth Rogen). She sleeps with him. She gets pregnant. She decides she should get to know Ben and ask for his blessings and support with her impending motherhood.

Beautiful young women don't sleep with losers. ""Knocked Up"" deals with this fact of life by assuring us that Alison was good'n'plastered when she did it. Women don't drag men they hardly know to every gynecologist in town either. Or any men, for that matter. Half of the behavior in this film is unrealistic. The other half is so dysfunctional that I sure hope it's unrealistic. It must have taken a lot of work to invent 2 hours and 10 minutes of bizarre activity for one prissy pregnant woman, her paranoid harpy sister, and infantile doughy boyfriend. These are the sort of characters who expend a great deal of energy creating problems for themselves where there are none.

That would be all right if it were funny. But ""Knocked Up"" is a half hour too long and contains one funny scene: Alison's home pregnancy tests. It's early in the movie. The rest are dull interactions among people whose conflicts are caused by the fact that their expectations of one another come from another planet, as far as I can make out. At some point it deteriorates into a cliched battle of the sexes. The most remarkable thing about ""Knocked Up"" is that is has puritanical undertones in spite of all the sex and drugs. Like ""40-Year-Old Virgin"", it promotes extremely conservative values. This time it's nuclear families and choosing baby over career.",1192320000,5,2020,5.008928571428571
2912696,5,B000TZJBP6,"With ""40 Year Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" director-writer Jud Apitow has created a new and exhiliarating genre, profanely scatalogical modern morality comedies.  Here, Ben (Seth Rogen), an immature pot-smoker who operates a pornographic website, has to confront adulthood when he impregnates Allison (Katherine Heigl) an upright (uptight?) attractive TV entertainment personality.  Given the circumstances, it is plausible that these two could have had one night of wild abandon.  Apatow's accomplishment here is to have us believe that Allison would accept this loser as the father of her child and make the best of an unfortunate situation.  Despite Allison's Herculean efforts to rehab Ben she eventually throws in the towel.  By doing that Ben has to now confront the choices he's made in life.  Apatow's premise wouldn't work if the main actors didn't have chemistry or didn't believe in the set-up.  Major kudos have to go out to Rogen and mainly Heigl for making the story believable.  Apatow also offers a paralell story involving Allison's sister and brother-in law played by Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd who after three kids they find their marriage in a bit of a rut.  Apatow has some prescient observations about marriage that ring very true.  On a final note, probably my favorite scene is one where a very pregnant Allison and her sister are denied admission to a swanky club.  Allison's sister then browbeats the bouncer for the offence.  What's hysterical about this scene is how the bouncer responds in measured tones that leaves the sister's jaw on the floor.",1192233600,,1575,5.109375

The strongest part of the film is the begining and Katherine Heigl.  I know that the part of the premise was that this is what too much alcohol can do, but Alison started talking to Ben when she was stone cold sober and even then you wondered what the attraction was.  Yeah, he was kind of goofy cute, but still very creepy.  But somewhere a long the way, the film stops being funny and then you're very aware of how long this movie is dragging and dragging.  By the end, it feels more like a series drama on cable than part of the movie you started out watching.  And does anyone believe that this couple actually pulls this off?  Maybe it's a good thing that the film doesn't pull a campy ending where we eventually see the wedding Alison kept rejecting because I don't think anyone would have bought it.

Do everyone a favor and just don't watch it, don't review it on here or any other web site, just move along to some safe PG Disney entertainment. Everybody will be much happier.

I did laugh in a lot of parts but I didn't find it to be up to the level of say '40 Year Old Virgin' or 'Wedding Crashers'. I also thought that a lot of the scenes with the lead guy (curly hair fat schlub from 40 Year Old Virgin) and his roomates to be really 'unfunny'. I did like the fact that this movie like Parenthood really had some serious moments that made you think about what the situation of having a baby would really be like.,1192060800,,537,3.9357798165137616

2912702,3,B000TZJBP6,"In 2007, Director Judd Apatow comes back with another ""over the top"" adult comedy--that probably will do well at the box office. Knocked Up is without a doubt; a step down from his previous 2005 smash hit The 40 year old Virgin. This time around, we get a much simpler story, draggy moments, irritating characters, and excessive profanity--which is pure comedy for some--with occasional laughs. These are not the only ""qualities"" of his latest creation. I almost forgot to mention that the movie is more than 2 hours long, for a comedy! If you're married man and want to get out of the house, skip this movie at all costs because it will probably make you hate your life.

Brief Story (small spoilers):
The young and attractive Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) works behind the scenes for the E! TV Network. Suddenly she is promoted to be on TV--probably because of her looks. These are exciting news because she always wanted to be on TV. She decides to celebrate her promotion and goes to a nightclub along with her older sister Debbie (Leslie Mann). At the bar, she meets Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) who she finds interesting--despite his not-so-great looks. After dancing and many drinks, they go back to her house--which is the same house where her sister Debbie lives with her husband Pete (Paul Rudd) and 2 kids. They have sex without protection.

The next morning she finds out ugly truths about the guy she slept with the night before--an irresponsible pothead who has no money and doesn't work. Ben is not the right man for Alison (apparently). Alison leaves him but a bigger problem is coming. She finds out that she is pregnant and their problems begin.

Review:
Knocked Up is probably the most irritating movie I've seen this year, with very few laughs and over the top profanity--even Martin Scorsese would get offended with the language. Director Judd Appatow wrote a very simple story; poles-apart couple gets drunk (one night stand), she gets pregnant and they have to make the best of it. Everybody loves a baby, right? While this dysfunctional and irresponsible couple is dealing with their mistakes, they fight and reunited, then fight some more until the predictable ""happy"" ending. It's not the plot what bothers me; it's the annoying characters that portray the worst of the American society. Our characters are; a jealous married woman who gets angry all the time; a frustrated husband who wants to get out of the house; a fat pothead guy who smokes all the time and doesn't know what to do with his life and an unsecured young girl. Is the immaturity what makes people laugh?

I don't understand what's so funny about couples fighting and swearing at each other every few minutes. Apparently this is the kind of material that has become the ""mainstream"" comedy in America today--the abysmally bad movie The Break Up is another example of this kind of comedy. Why everything has to be in excess? Too much swearing and drug use gets old pretty fast.

I'm not even going to talk about technical issues like special effects, continuity or logic in this film--things like these can be overlooked in comedy. Is there something good in Knocked Up? I just want to say that ""some"" of the situations in the film did make me laugh--especially, the second love scene and the kid's birthday party. Also the best character in the movie is Pete. He is a likable guy and we understand where he is coming from--I'd kill myself if I had a wife like that-- but he is calm and has some good lines in the movie.

The Verdict:
This kind of comedy is very successful nowadays and after telling people what I thought about Knocked Up, as weird as it sounds, some of you might still watch it and find it entertaining. I'm not going to deny it, there are few good laughs, but it goes too far with the profanity and the drug use. Also, I wasn't too happy the way the director portrays the American society. I guess stereotypes work well in the genre.",1191888000,5,3941,4.687861271676301
2912703,3,B000TZJBP6,"I'd read the excellent reviews, which I think led to a case of overexpectation.  This movie is only OK.  Its not as funny as I hoped and in fact was downright boring at times.  And who believes that a beautiful, smart women like Katherine Heigl would have sex with a lazy, broke, fat slob like Seth Rogen?  This is a male fantasy, but the story has chick flick written all over it.  HD DVD picture quality is OK, but not great.

The following illustrates the problem with high def formats in general.  I rented my copy and it was scratched.  It played OK except for some minor periodic skipping until it finally froze.  This was after I had cleaned it twice and is a problem I encounter frequently with rented HD DVD's.  They seem much more susceptible to scratching or else the player is less able to recover from data transfer errors.  Either way its annoying and makes me leery of renting.  So I flip it over and finish watching the standard def version and guess what?  It didn't look much worse.  It was a bit more blurry and the colors more muted, but I doubt my wife would have noticed and we were watching on a 1080p projector with a 106 inch diagonal screen.  The difference would be even smaller on a 50 or 60 inch TV.  The cost premium of HD DVD and Blu-Ray discs is simply not worth it in my opinion and most people probably agree with me judging by the miniscule sales of high def discs.",1191801600,,1400,4.306513409961686
2912704,5,B000TZJBP6,this movie is for anyone with a sense of humor...its the funniest movie ever made! plus it does have a great story...if i could...i'd give this movie 20 out of 5 stars!,1191801600,,168,4.28125
2912705,2,B000TZJBP6,"This movie got outstanding reviews from virtually all of the professional movie critics. They couldn't shut up about it supposedly being ""laugh filled"" and ""funny as hell."" The normally sensible NEW YORK POST critic, Kyle Smith, claimed that it was ""an era-defining comedy classic."" Ross Douthat of NATIONAL REVIEW went so far as to claim that the film was a ""sort of social conservatism,"" despite all the drug use and the out-of-wedlock birth.

It's not a terrible film but it certainly doesn't live up to the hype. The high expectations created by the critics' adoration are one reason this reviewer (and I'm sure many others) are down on this flick.

An up-and-coming TV personality with brains and very attractive Nordic looks (Alison) gets pregnant after what was supposed to be a one-night stand with a fat, unemployed, drug-addled, ex-pat Canuck (Ben) who is living off of some kind of disability award from the government of British Columbia. (Ben's immigration status is unclear. He certainly didn't come in on an employment visa!) Alison decides to keep the baby after seeing the unborn child's heart beating on a sonogram. The rest of the film is about this extremely odd couple trying to make their relationship work.

While I watched this flick, I couldn't help but think that the right girl for this guy would be someone like Roseanne Barr.

The viewers reaction to one scene in particular is a good barometer of whether or not you'll like this film: Ben goes to Vegas with Pete, the husband of Alison's sister, and they watch Cirque de Soleil while high on ""magic mushrooms."" It wasn't funny to me, but if that sounds funny to you then my guess is you'll like this film.

The scene that this reviewer found the most amusing was when all the evidence suggests that Pete is having an affair, and Ben, Alison and her sister follow him to the suspected love nest, a suburban bungalow. They burst in expecting to find him in the sack with his paramour. Instead, they find him with a group of guys playing fantasy/simulation baseball. That was funny, although not all that original: There was a similar scene in the 1942 film ""Pride of the Yankees"" with Gary Cooper.",1191801600,10,2175,4.789333333333333
2912706,2,B000TZJBP6,"I watched this movie for the first time on DVD.  I was apalled by the language - when will writers learn that real people DO NOT talk that way 24/7.  None of the movie's contrived situations made sense.  It was gratuitous from the opening credits.

This is not a story line that is untold.  There have been many before it, which were told much better.  It's a shame, really, because this concept did seem to be a fresh, modern take on an age-old problem.  I was eager to see its variation.

And then I watched it.  I was ready to stop the DVD and hurl the disk into the nearest landfill after 30 minutes, but stayed through until the end.  I had heard the movie was a hit in theaters.  I still don't know why.  It never misses an opportunity to be vulgar.

2912707,4,B000TZJBP6,"I rented this because I'd heard it was hilarious. It isn't, but it's still a very enjoyable movie, although perhaps a bit longer than it needed to be. As the title indicates, Knocked Up is about an aspiring young woman, Alison,  who gets pregnant accidentally. This happens during a one-night stand with Ben, a basically decent but doofy and unambitious man who is still living a frat-boy lifestyle with his slacker friends. The movie traces how relationships develop, focusing mainly on Ben and Alison, but also touching on developments in the lives of others, including Alison's sister and her husband.

There's an awful lot of crudity throughout the movie, including both rough language and sexually explicit scenes. However, if you look (and listen) past the crudeness, this is basically a sweet and good-hearted movie about growing up, facing life, and doing the right thing.  A good ""date movie"" if you and your date don't mind bad language and gross-out behavior.",1191715200,,970,5.05

I have seen many other releases that offer both versions and they sell well. OK.... now to the movie itself. I thought this film would be funnier, but in all fairness it did have it's moments. I also think this is one of those movies that gets better with age and repeat viewing. The cast is loaded with veteran comedic actors in large and cameo roles which helps out a lot.

Well, we were having such a blast at the cheesecake bistro that we never made it to the movie. Thank goodness. It would have set a weird tone for the night because it turned out to be nothing like the comedy we were excpecting. We bought it and watched it the day it came out. It just wasn't funny for either of us (and we LOVE funny movies- Wil farrel, Adam Sandler, Harold & Kumar, Van Wilder, we're pretty easy to please in the comedy genre.) Thruought most of the movie it makes the guy say ""I hate when women do that, why do they do that!""...and it makes the girl say ""I hate when guys do that! Why do they do that!"" but not so much in a hilarious blooper kind of way, just regular crap that annoys the genders about each other. If they wanted to take typical girl/guy mistakes and disagreements and make them funny then they should have used more creativity. Perhaps a touch of the Ben Stiller approach (just a touch though) and had some of those simple mistkes or misunderstandings lead to crazy events that have you thinking ""OMG What are the odds of that!? Lol, poor guy/girl!"" I am also 11 weeks pregnant now with my first child, and at the end when she has the baby (very graphic) had me in tears! I didn't want to cry, I wanted to laugh and neither one of us did much of that except for the occasional ""Ha!"" and maybe a giggle. Hopefully no one is upset thinking I gave away the end, because long before I saw this movie I heard from serveral people that at the end there was a graphic baby scene- I just din't expect it to make me cry. Perhaps it wouldn't have hit so hard if the movie had been more of a lighthearted comedy up until that point, but it was almost kind of frustrating for each member of the opposite sex.",1191456000,2,1889,4.206611570247934
2912712,4,B000TZJBP6,"I really like this movie because of the honesty and heart that it has. Yeah, it's a screwy comedy but just like 40-Year-Old-Virgin it has this whole natural vibe and believability to the characters and story that it's almost like watching an actual slice of life. This movie is really funny and I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this great film.

That being said, I thought the HD-DVD for this film was a treat. The picture looks great and the sound is as good as it would be for a film of this nature so don't expect to be bombarded by your surround speakers. The extras are plentiful and other than the kind of steep price for the combo format disc (let's face it people, this combo thing makes no sense), I'd give this one a full thumbs up.

(NOTE: I have a Xbox 360 HD-DVD player and was having problems with the disc as many others have had. If for any reason the disc won't play on your Xbox 360 player and goes back to the dashboard after several seconds of playing nothing but black, go to the HD player's memory and delete all the content on it and then go back and allow the disc to go through the loading process at the beginning.

2912714,5,B000TZJBP6,"Knocked Up
This summer's biggest and best comedy wasn't a Jim Carrey laugh-fest, a Will Ferrell farce, or even a Ben Stiller awkward family comedy. It was the dirty, sexual, and surprisingly heart warming Knocked Up.
  Judd Apatow, who wrote and directed the film, knocks another one out of the park after his rookie smash hit The 40 Year Old Virgin. Some are calling him the new king of comedy, but Apatow has been specializing in writing the best TV shows you never saw with 1999's Freaks and Geeks and 2001's Undeclared for years. He's a comedy veteran who's finally getting his well-deserved due.
  The story centers on Ben Stone, a professional slacker who has a weakness for drugs and Jewish jokes, and his one-night stand with professional and beautiful Alison Scott. The pairing is beauty and the beast, if the beast had a ""Jew-fro"" and put on a couple pounds. As one can expect from the title, Alison gets pregnant and chaos ensues.
  Seth Rogen, who has been with Apatow since the beginning, proves himself to be the next in line to be this generation's comedic genius. He carries the film better than Will Ferrell ever could, and he doesn't even have to. Rogen gives Ben the perfect amount of vulgarness and maturity. Every male under thirty will see parts of himself in Ben.
  And on the other end of the puzzle is Katherine Heigl, star of a little show called Grey's Anatomy. If you think you know Seattle Grace Hospital intern Izzy Stevens, think again. Heigl reveals a part of herself that blows Izzy out of the water. Her Alison is funny, tenacious, and by the climax of the film, very, very pregnant.
  As if these two weren't enough, Apatow has stacked his movie with a ridiculously hilarious supporting cast including Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann (Apatow's wife in real life.) These crazy characters add even more for the viewer to relate to. Everyone has friends like this, except not near as funny.
  Some people might think this couple is a little unrealistic, asking themselves what a girl like Alison is doing with a guy like Ben, but in reality, stranger things have happened. Also, the film is rated R and it deserves every bit of it. But as any twenty-something will attest, it's nothing but realistic. It's a long and raunchy road toward adulthood.
  In the end, Knocked Up is the glorious product of three people; Judd Apatow, Seth Rogen, and Katherine Heigl. If any of them had failed, the audience would have been left with a mediocre comedy with a somewhat sappy ending. But as it stands, Knocked Up is a landmark comedy film of the last decade. It's right up there with Old School, Wedding Crashers, and even Apatow's first triumph. It will make people flinch, cry, hurt, and gag... but all while they are laughing their butts off.",1191283200,,2761,4.677685950413223
2912715,1,B000TZJBP6,"He was great as a side character in the 40 Year Old Virgin, he was great as a side character in Undeclared, he's not great as a leading actor, unfortunately.

The 40 Year Old Virgin was ok, Carrell was obviously more than able to carry a whole movie on his own, Rogen cannot.  But I didn't go into this hoping for another 40 year old virgin, I went into it hoping to laugh, and I did, maybe a whole 3 times during the 2 + hours it took for this to end.

I didn't care about the characters, as the performances seemed like they were either mailed in or so over the top it would make Al Pacino blush in embarrassment.  I've read here & there that there's a lot of attention paid to character in the film, as if this is supposed to be a comedic character study.  Hardly, it's just another 120 minutes of Apatow's same old schtick, odd references and ""you"" this and ""you"" that.

All the actors and actresses in this movie are incredibly charismatic and deliver their lines (often improvised) brilliantly. You can tell the cast had fun making this movie, and I guarantee you'll have fun watching it. If you're a fan of Judd Apatow's work then this is a must-buy.

2912717,2,B000TZJBP6,"The main thing I would like to call attention to is that the movie seemed slapped together.  There are many examples of this; but one of the more glaring is the very last scene.  The male lead announces - seemingly seriously - that he has got a spacious apartment in East LA.  Then, in the same scene, the car is shown going down the California Incline onto the Pacific Coast Highway, heading north.  Now, perhaps the guy was joking about living in East LA, but he could hardly be living in an apartment somewhere up the PCH, since his apartment is a short drive from the female lead's apartment and SHE doesn't live up the PCH.  The geography of Los Angeles is played fast and loose and vague throughout the movie.  The first scene involves the female lead driving her sister's kids ""to school"" and what we see is a ""five mile"" drive down San Vicente, heading out to the beach.  Now, first of all, the kids are quite separate in age, so they would not be going to the same school.  The younger kid wouldn't even be old enough for pre-school.  And yet we are supposed to swallow that they go ""to school"" somewhere in Santa Monica, because that's where they're headed.  But actually we are not supposed to think anything of the kind.  This is one of those movies where the audience is not supposed to know anything  about LA.  So you'll see some driving down San Vicente, because its real purty, with no justification for it, no idea of where these people are supposed to live or where they are going.  So that, by the end when they senselessly head up the PCH toward Mel Gibson's house, you're supposed to be drinking that down like water.",1191283200,5,1639,4.438127090301004

2912719,2,B000TZJBP6,"When I heard about this film, I really had no desire to see it.  Then seeing that it was one of the best reviewed films ever on Rotten Tomatoes, I decided to see why many of the nation's critics were proclaiming this film to be a major masterpiece, on line with some of the greatest comedies ever committed to celluloid.  Normally, when a film has a 90 percent approval on Rotten Tomatoes, I am suspicious.  The vulgarity of the film doesn't bother me.  The childishness of most of the main characters doesn't bother me.  What deeply offends me is the preposterousness of the main story.  These 2 characters would never get together in real life, only in a contrived, forced feel good movie such as this.  This is another variation on stoner slob ""regular"" guy meets impossibly beautiful woman, and they get it on.  Hollywood is probably to blame for bad relationships across the board in this country because of films like this.  In reality, if a woman got pregnant by a guy like this, she would either have the baby on her own, or more likely, procure an abortion.  It feels like that cliche that the ""couple should stay together for the kids"", which in the long run hurts the children.  In reality, the woman would have woken up the next morning, realised she made a mistake, and would have taken care of it.

The film does have some funny moments.  I especially like Ryan Seacrest, who is actually the funniest thing in the film.  There's a scene where Seth tokes on a bong with a gas mask on, which I found to be cool.  And some of Seth's friends repartee is amusing, though not incredible sweet, touching, and hilarious as the critics are trying to make us believe.  It boggles the mind that the critics would make this film sound like a masterpiece.  Maybe Judd Apatow is a really cool guy and treats critics well.  Or maybe our standards are pretty abysmal right now, so a mediocre film like this gets raised to the level of Duck Soup and Lawrence of Arabia.

Overall, there's a few funny bits here and there, but the main story is so preposterous it's insulting.  It's not worth your time.",1191196800,6,2098,4.514588859416445

Yet, there is no discernible fluctuation in the humor or the genuinely good spirit the films generate. Blessedly free of exhausting crescendo moments, the dialogue has a nice ramshackle feel and so do the characters. You really feel you want to know what happens to them after the film ends.

The story looks at the outset like your standard Hollywood opposites-attract rom-com as it centers on the burgeoning relationship between Ben Stone, the perfectly named definition of a slacker, and Alison Scott, the beautiful entertainment reporter. They meet at a trendy LA bar where she is celebrating her promotion to on-air personality. Ben buys her a beer, and she is impressed enough by his unexpected chivalry to keep him company. One thing leads to another, and you can guess the rest. But what you can't guess so easily is how these characters respond to the situation and to each other. There is also a surrounding gallery of characters offering their own opinions about what is developing, in particular, Alison's acerbic older sister Debbie, who is facing a crisis of her own as the control-freak wife of passively dissatisfied husband Pete. Their story intertwines nicely with the main plotline to the point where each makes the other more resonant.

As a last-minute substitute for Anne Hathaway, Katherine Heigl proves she can translate her natural likeability on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grey-s-Anatomy/dp/B000MUV58Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grey's Anatomy</a>&nbsp;to the big screen with ease. As Alison, she shows herself to be the rare actress who can be drop-dead gorgeous, smartly aware and genuinely non-judgmental. Apatow's wife Leslie Mann, who memorably demanded French toast while driving drunkenly through LA in Virgin, is terrific as Debbie, an often-irritating mass of neuroses whom you somehow like despite herself. She has a great self-revelatory scene with a bouncer outside the same bar we see at the beginning. Paul Rudd plays Pete in his deceptively casual manner with a standout scene stoned in a Vegas hotel room.

Harold Ramis has a nice small scene as Ben's proud dad, while Ben's friends are an assortment of slacker-types played out like a well-tuned improv troupe.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saturday-Night-Live/dp/B000VIHPTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saturday Night Live</a>'s Kristen Wiig deserves special mention for her hilarious turn as Alison's not-so-covertly jealous co-worker. My one complaint about the film is just some of the sluggish pacing toward the last third of the film, the same problem I had with Virgin. A running time of now 133 minutes seems a bit long for the story being told here, though the birthing scene is hilariously executed, in particular, a scene-stealing bit by Ken Jeong as the passive-aggressive gynecologist called on to deliver the baby at the last minute. One other minor irritant is the deliberate reference to Virgin in some of the dialogue between Ben and Pete. Regardless, this is one smart, heartfelt character-driven farce that far exceeded my expectations.

The DVD extras are abundant to say the least. First, there is the funny frat-buddy camaraderie on the commentary track with Apatow, Rogen and Bill Hader, a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saturday-Night-Live/dp/B000VIHPTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saturday Night Live</a>&nbsp;comic who plays Alison's film-editing colleague at E! Unsurprisingly, there are lots of deleted and extended scenes on both discs, which really shows how Apatow encouraged his actors to use improv to hit the right emotional notes in their characters. More of this riffing can be found in the ""Line-O-Ramas"" contained on both discs - quick edits showing the actors making up alternate versions of their lines - as well as the ""Raw Footage"" of two key scenes on Disc Two, in which Heigl and Rogen keep going until they hit their key moments regardless of the script.

Disc One has a very funny short called ""Directing the Director"", which has filmmaker Bennett Miller (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Capote/dp/B000E33VWW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Capote</a>) following Apatow around just in case Universal decides to drop him over perceived creative control issues. Disc Two has two highlights - Apatow's video diary, a surprisingly revelatory half-hour featurette that picks him up at various points during the 56-day shoot, and the adroitly amusing ""Finding Ben Stone"", a faux-documentary which would have us believe that Apatow went through a number of actors to play the main character before settling on Rogen. Familiar faces like Orlando Bloom, James Franco, Justin Long and David Krumholtz (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Numb3rs/dp/B000SO7PC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Numb3rs</a>), among several, have fun with their images playing ego-driven Hollywood types providing constant frustration for Apatow. Krumholtz also shows up in another short, ""Gummy: the 6th Roommate"", playing a character that Apatow wants us to think was dropped from the final cut for lack of chemistry with the other roommates.

There are several smaller shorts focusing on random elements like Apatow and Mann's children (cast in the film as Mann and Rudd's kids), the strippers in the Vegas casino club, the opening rollercoaster scene at Magic Mountain, roommate Martin's growing beard, the first sex scenes for Rogen and Jonah Hill, and silliest of all, alternate versions of existing scenes with Rogen playing them topless. Heigl's impressive audition tape is included here, as well as a short focused on Jeong and an extended version of an excised scene where his character has a wildly hilarious meltdown in the hospital. Loudon Wainwright III's musical contributions are also featured with three live performances as well as a featurette on his composing sessions. This is one DVD set generously well stocked with goodies.",1191110400,,8298,6.154443485763589
2912721,5,B000TZJBP6,"Two years ago, ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" was easily the funniest film of the year. Barely a second went by without a very funny joke popping up. One of the scene-stealers in that film was Seth Rogen, who gained the lead in director Judd Apatow's film ""Knocked Up"" and co-wrote/co-starred in one of the other highest grossing comedies of this year ""Superbad."" In ""Knocked Up"" (which is either the funniest or 2nd funniest film of 2007), Rogen plays Ben...An overweight, unemployed, loser that is working on a website with his 4 buddies/roommates that sounds a lot like Mr. Skin. Katherine Heigl (of ""Grey's Anatomy,"" who is stunning) plays Allison, the beautiful, skinny, woman-of-every-guys-dreams kind of girl that works on the E! network.
On the night of her promotion, Allison goes to a club with her sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) and ends up going home with Ben. 8 weeks later, she finds out that she's pregnant. The rest of the film deals with Ben and Allison trying to fall in love, so they can raise the baby together. Just as Apatow did with ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" he takes a very simple premise and extends it into an over 2-hour film that never grows dull and always stays funny. And ""Knocked Up,"" is funny. All the actors are perfect and Apatow is proving himself to be one of the most talented comedic writer & director's in the business. Comedy is a word that is used pretty loosely these days. Most ""comedies"" are 90 minutes long, with 4 funny jokes (see ""Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny."" Actually, don't see it...It proves what I mean). This film actually deserves to be dubbed a comedy, because it's actually funny. Don't miss this film.

2912729,4,B000TZJBP6,"Knocked Up is the story of an E! correspondant named Alison (Katharine Heigl) and an illegal Canadian alien named Ben (Seth Rogan) who after a drunken night together discover that they are going to have a baby. Reactions are unfavorable all around, but both decide they want to keep the child. Over the two and a half hour span of the film, they manage to fight, make up, break up, and change each others' lives forever. Such a serious subject needs major comedy to lighten the mood, and that is just what we get.

This situation is probably more common than most people realize. Neither of these characters are made to be exceptions to the rule, and both are believably normal. Perhaps some of the comedy comes from its truth.

The cast is outstanding. At every corner there is a familiar face from four former Freaks and Geeks co-stars (Rogan, Martin Starr, Jason Segel and James Franco) to well-known comics (Mo Collins and Steve Carell) and veteran actors (Paul Feig, Leslie Mann and Joanna Kerns).

There are two kinds of people who will watch this film, people who love it and people who hate it. The comedy is immature, often vulgar, and off the wall. There are plenty of drug references, a few scenes with nudity, and tons of sexual references. This is certainly not a movie for kids, or for adults who are easily offended.",1190851200,3,1331,4.63135593220339

Highlights include the faux-documentary on several actors trying to do Ben Stone (Seth Rogen's character) including Micheal Cera (Superbad, Arrested development), Allen Covert (Grandma's Boy) and even Judd Apatow himself. There's also the various lineorama's or alternate lines used in the same scene improvised like all the beard insult and dr. kumi's various remarks befor the birth scene.

It is halarious throughout and Rogen has proved to be a great comedian actor as conquers another Sex Comedy!

Now for the Disc::
The PQ is a great transfer...a definite step up from The 40 year old virgin. The Comedies on HDDVD are not the best transfers but good for the type of film they are. The audio is, like most comedies, a mediocre take as there is no need for a trueHD audio track if there are no explosion or action sequences of such. The Extras are excellent!!! Universal packs in PIP U-control which really does add alot to the film as you watch through over and over again.

2912736,4,B000TZJBP6,"I saw the ""40 Year Old Virgin"" and the first thing I thought of was, what a concept: a comedy film that is marketable to both men and women! If you are a man, usually you prefer the Three Stooges-type humor of banging other people over the head and if you're a woman, you like a good old romantic comedy. Both the ""40 year Old Virgin and ""Knocked Up"" (same director on both films if you didn't already know)mix both successfully. The stoner/slacker friends of Ben are hilariously real (is this what guys really do when we're not around? Yep!) and Alison and her sister play the long-suffering women that put up with the men's crudeness because, well, because we all do to some degree! It's realistic, outrageous, crude, rude, totally un-politically correct and a riot!

2912737,3,B000TZJBP6,"Not really a movie for the guys- yet not completely a movie for the ladies - Knocked Up strikes a fittingly oddball balance between the two.  Most definitely NOT a first date movie but something you can enjoy with a longtime significant other or group of friends.

Great performances all around.  Seth pulls off the unlikely leading man effortlessly.  Rudd and Mann turn in particularly strong comedic performances (you WILL love to hate Debbie).  I'm a bit on the fence about Katherine Heigl's performance of Alison Scott- career girl turned expectant mother.  Don't misunderstand-  Alison's character is not written or acted badly by any means- she's just not as memorable as the rest of the cast and that's a real shame.

Knocked Up is far from pure comedy, dipping a little too often and lingering a little too long on the life lessons, yet it largely remains fun throughout.

We've yet to see the best from Rogen and his buddies and that is what excites me most.  Someone get this guy a road-trip movie completely devoid of drama STAT!",1190592000,,1040,4.759776536312849

Think again...

There were maybe two genuine chuckles through the entire movie, then I spent the rest of time feeling embarassed at their lame attempt at humor.

The dialogue has a biting wit that I think will be much appreciated by adults (considering I definitely don't recommend this movie for younger viewers). Everything and anything is satirical fodder for this film, including sex, drugs, marriage, careers, childbirth (of course), healthcare, raising a family, learning to grow up -- you name it, chances are this movie will poke fun at it. While overall there is a comedic light heartedness to the movie as a whole, it also acknowledges the serious aspects of the situation it's characters find themselves in. An unwed young woman at a crucial point in her career who finds herself pregnant by a marajuana smoking unemployed bum is not a situation some might see as...well...funny -- but this movie manages to make it hilarious!

Seth Rogen starrs alongside Katherine Heigl, and both actors do a phenomenal job, each committing to each scene in a way that is almost insane. Heigl actually temporarily lost her voice after filming the birthing scene due to her full out shrieking for hours. While much of the humor errs on the side of lewdness, the biggest shock factor comes at the end during the birth -- so prepare yourself!

If there is a flaw to this movie, I think it would be that the actual birth scene at the end felt a little short. They probably could have done a lot more with that pivotal moment, but overall its done very well.

Most of the time you have to purchase the 2 disc edition to get any worthwhile special features these days, but this single disc edition actually has a pretty satisfying array of available features -- including deleted scenes, extended/alternate scenes, a gag reel, writer/director/producer commentary, a feature titled Line-O-Rama in which it shows take after take of the actors ad-libbing different lines in various scenes, and many more.

Bottom line, if you don't like lewd, crass, and very R rated humor, then this isn't the movie for you. But trust me, you'd be missing out, because I haven't laughed so hard at a movie in a long time!",1190505600,11,2573,5.131264916467781

For a good amount of time, Knocked Up is a vulgarly funny comedy that finds Seth Rogen and hottie Katherine Heigl as mis-matched mates whose one night stand escalates into said pregnancy.  From that point forward though, Apatow tries way too hard to get into the character's heads, and towards the end of the film, throws one non-sensical leap of logic at you right after the other, even when it becomes clear that the film has a pro-life propoganda intention to it (not to mention what appears to be in-film advertising for Spider-Man 3).  There are some highpoints here though, most notably with the supporting cast.  Rogen, in his first starring role, is decent enough, but the best moments definitely go to Paul Rudd as the jaded husband of Heigl's sister (Leslie Mann).  Harold Ramis is on board as well as Rogen's father, who it's always good to see on screen, even if it's all too brief.  In the end, Knocked Up ends up being a typical and predictable (not to mention overlong) mainstream comedy that doesn't push boundaries nearly as far as it thinks it does, and despite it's game cast and occasionally funny moments, Knocked Up isn't anything you haven't seen before and probably seen better.",1189987200,6,1342,4.738197424892704

Knocked Up is a HILARIOUS movie. In short if you liked SuperBad, 40 Year Old Virgin, Accepted or even Wedding Crashers you will more than likely love this movie.

I'll spare you the rest of the synopsis, as you can read that almost anywhere. However, I will say that there are few movies that provide these kinds of laughs so many times during the film.

2912747,3,B000TZJBP6,"Knocked Up is a new movie from Judd Apatow, the man behind The Forty Year Old Virgin. I'm almost ashamed to admit I enjoyed the crude but surprisingly sweet ""Virgin."" Knocked Up gives you more of the same. It stars Seth Rogan, who had a hilarious supporting part in ""Virgin"", and Katherine Heigle, the beautiful current star of Grey's Anatomy. Heigle, playing E! reporter Allison Scott, goes out on the town to celebrate a big promotion. At the bar, she meets Ben (Rogan). Allison is beautiful (I can't emphasize that enough) and Ben is basically a slob. With shades of Notting Hill, they end up sleeping together. Eight weeks later Allison finds out she is pregnant.

What is she going to do? She turns to her sister Debbi, played by Leslie Mann, for advice. Allison has a great career, and Ben is a pothead loser. She decides to keep the baby, and willingly allows Ben to be a part of the future baby's life.  Ben thus gets closer with Allison and Debbie and Debbie's husband Pete (played by Paul Rudd.) This movie is crude yet sweet, raunchy yet traditional. At the heart of the film is a romantic comedy. Yet it is filled with scenes with comically crass dialogue and all the anguish associated with having a baby.

I'm not one of those people that think everything Apatow does is the greatest. I liked ""Virgin"" better than this, and I've never watched Freaks & Geeks, the 90s TV show whose cast plays a large part in this film. Knocked Up is a good movie with funny moments and emotional moments. It had a lot of good cameos too.

I'll recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys a good raunchy comedy, but I do have a few complaints. First, this is a romantic comedy. In every romantic comedy, the leads get together, then conflict tears them apart, then they get back together. Usually, the getting back together is what makes or break the movie. In Knocked Up, Ben and Allison slowly grow to care about each other, but the conflict tears them apart. Pete and Debbie also have conflict. The movie is incredibly weak in showing how the conflict is resolved, and so I left the movie not totally buying into Ben and Allyson's relationship. My second complaint is that this movie is very very very pro drug use. Quite disappointing since smoking weed is ILLEGAL. Some might say it took an anti drug turn at the end, but I don't buy it. That was really disappointing and irresponsible in my opinion. I'm mature enough to enjoy a movie yet not buy into the message it is preaching. The movie could have been just as good without all of the promoting of illegal drug use.",1189382400,,2570,4.532327586206897
2912748,5,B000TZJBP6,"With this film, I just became a Seth Rogen fan. Just right now, I did. I've been peripherally aware of this guy, having seen him in miniscule parts in ANCHORMAN: THE LEGEND OF RON BURGUNDY, YOU, ME & DUPREE, and, most notably, THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN. But, here in KNOCKED UP, he takes lead actor honors and he's simply awesome. Yes, see this movie for the other actors, as well - Katherine Heigl, Paul Rudd, and Leslie Mann all shine - but, in my eyes, this is a cinematic coming out party for Seth Rogen. And, if nothing else, this chubby guy gives hope to uncool, unhandsome, just plain folks like me.

This is the story of Ben and Alison. Ben (Seth Rogen) is a laid-back, unemployed teddy bear of a guy who whiles away his time smoking weed and, with his slacker buddies, striving to construct a celebrity skin website (these guys are obviously unaware of the online site Mr. Skin, already in place). In a club, he bumps into way-out-of-his-league Alison (Katherine Heigl), a gorgeous career girl celebrating a promotion. Booze is poured, sparks are ignited, and Alison and Ben hook up. As sometimes happen, the next morning opens with hangovers and regrets and a butt-crack. Alison gets a good sober look at Ben, who then doesn't help his case by throwing up and then championing the merits of post-drunk vomiting. Disgusted, Alison departs, with Ben knowing he goofed and philosophically assuming that that was that. But, 8 weeks later, Ben hears from Alison, who drops the news that she's expecting. And, because Ben is innately a good guy and Alison a fairly open-minded girl who doesn't want to do this alone, they make a go of being together.

This flick is a cheerful, very funny 2-hours-plus worth of sit down time. It definitely offers more than its ANIMAL HOUSE tendencies would have you initially believe. My gut feeling is that the folks involved in the making of this film had true affection for it, especially Director/Writer Judd Apatow. KNOCKED UP lays down consistent humor foraying into occasional bawdiness. I must admit that the film startled me with its display of genuine emotion and heart. I was prepared to be content with cardboard people and cheap laughs. Instead, underneath the crass trimmings, the unaffected, heartfelt core of the film surfaced and made me invest in the characters beyond a superficial level. I really liked the characters. Too, the rampant crudity and lewdness are balanced out by a humorous yet sensitive depiction of a marriage quietly on the rocks. With all the insights given, it actually feels like a real marriage.

Alison's older sister Debbie and Pete have been married for a while now and are raising two beautiful daughters. But life isn't like the movies, and Debbie and Pete, well-meaning people both, have problems. Debbie as played with delirious, high-strung brittleness by Leslie Mann is one of those pushy, righteous people who eventually gets under your skin, but she's not a bad person. Paul Rudd is comic gold as Pete, the fount of masterfully sly and dry comments, who can mostly tolerate Debbie's harangues but only if he gets the occasional alone time. Their not-quite-rosy relationship is plentifully plumbed, giving rise to spousal suspicions and bickerings and possibly previewing what the future holds for Alison and Ben. Too, Alison and Ben end up choosing sides as Alison is strictly with her sister while Ben espouses Pete's side. This puts a decided crimp in their own relationship.

Of course, this movie hinges on the leads' ability to generate interest and invoke sympathy from the viewer. And, let's face it, who wouldn't want Ben Stone for a buddy? Or Seth Rogen, for that matter? Ben is so good natured and easy going that I challenge anyone to not root for him and his maturation process. One of my favorite scenes is when he finally confronts Debbie. His chemistry with Heigl is apparent on screen; I can actually see this smoking hot girl being pals with and then falling for the prospectless, chubby but appealing loser, although, naturally, beer and possibly many shots of tequilla would have to be involved. Katherine Heigl had already turned my head with her performances in ROSWELL and THE RINGER. Here, much respect goes to Katherine as she shrugs off dignity and dives right into the thick of things. But, you know what, even when ignominiously suffering thru morning sickness, throwing hormonal hissy fits, or giving alarmingly painful birth, she maintains her full babefulness. As Alison,she comes across as an authentic person with an array of valid fears and insecurities. Katherine Heigl's good. And smoking hot.

The supporting players sparkle. Credit as a whole goes to Ben's insult-tossing cast of nowhere-headed pals, who may be hapless but are there for Ben. Two standouts are Ken Jeong as the strict and precise Asian doctor and SNL-er Kristen Wiig as some sort of network executive, she of the snide and off-the-wall verbal asides (""This is Hollywood. We don't like liars.""). Because Alison works for the E! network, we're treated to several cameos of famous folks playing themselves. Ryan Seacrest's lampooning of himself is a blast and it makes me like him a bit better.

I like to laugh and KNOCKED UP doled out laughter in multiple servings. Much of the humor is of the juvenile sort as a sizable chunk of the film is dedicated to the slacker amigos mercilessly bagging on each other. Your enjoyment of these jokes will depend on your pop-culture I.Q. (for example, do you know who Serpico is?). One guy who undertakes a shaving bet is incessantly strafed with facial hair insults (""Scorcese on coke"" ""Your face is like Robin William's knuckles.""). Be advised that there are moments here of THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY or AMERICAN PIE proportions. But, in the midst of the pot humor, the DeNiro impressions, and the scatalogical stuff, let me reiterate that there's an unfeigned sweetness and moments of honest soul searching which resonate clearly, and, gullible goofball that I am, I was charmed. Don't be fooled by the raunchy and ""modern"" conventions here; this film is firmly centered on family values. Ben Stone might be an adult at 23 years old, but this is still a coming of age story. And, yes, he does grow up here.

In his first lead role, Seth Rogen emerges as the genial, scruffy heart of the film. Now that he has it, here's hoping he can sustain his leading man status. If the ungainly Jack Black can do it, why not Seth, who's more lovable and cuddly? But there are other actors in the film. Heigl, Rudd, and Mann do great being witty and poignant, argumentative and loving, and real. KNOCKED UP allows both genders to have their moments. In terms of who's funny, Rogen and Rudd definitely come through, but Heigl and especially Mann deliver their ample share of levity. Just wait for the scene with the stressed Debbie having a brutal yet uproarious conversation with the nightclub doorman. The movie also has that something which lesser films would kill for, which is rapport among its stars. Chemistry abounds, between Rogen and Heigl, between Mann and Rudd, and between Rogen and Rudd. So, yeah, there are all sorts of reasons to go see KNOCKED UP. The fellas can latch onto the dirty, smutty humor and the smoking hot babes; for the girls, there are the pregnancy arc and the nice, unforced romance, as well as the sibling relationship of Alison and Debbie. Oh, and, apparently, Paul Rudd is a clever hunk and Seth Rogen is immensely huggable. But, me, I saw this to learn the dice move. I'm building up my dance repertoire.",1189296000,12,7560,4.837712519319938
2912749,4,B000TZJBP6,"You could throw a rock at a video shop and hit a movie about the joys of parenting, but very few of those gooey family flicks deal with the actual business of making the baby. That's where Knocked Up comes in. Delving fearlessly beneath the duvet of taboo, Judd Apatow's superb comedy follows the relationship between slobby stoner Ben (Seth Rogen) and go-getting TV exec Alison (Katharine Heigl) from a drunken one-night-stand to nursery shopping and labour pains.

Apatow is best known for his rollicking sex farce The 40 Year Old Virgin, but Knocked Up is pitched at a considerably lower key. While the subject matter is bawdy and the language extremely saucy, most of the laughs (and there are lots of them) spring from conversations rather than gross-out set pieces. Rogen's likeable slacker and his no-hoper pals can discuss the finer points of celebrity nudity until your eyes are watering, while on the other side of the partnership, Alison's sister (Leslie Mann) and her husband (Paul Rudd) provide a spot-on portrait of an arid marriage.

""YOU'LL BE SNORTING POPCORN OUT OF YOUR NOSE""

Like its central character's life, Knocked Up has a messy story, but one imbued with such sweetness that it's impossible not to love. It's a romance with the cutest of twists - imagine if Romeo and Juliet had nine months to fall in love before Julie Jr arrived - told with the laconic charm of a good stand-up routine and laced with moments of genuine insight. It's an adult comedy - not smutty (well OK, it is kinda smutty) but a comedy for and about adults. Most importantly, it's so funny that you'll be snorting popcorn out of your nose before the end.",1189209600,,1652,4.7491289198606275

Few weeks down the line, the same girl realizes she's pregnant. Now what? Now Knocked Up.

The humor in the film is the reason it is one of the best films I've seen this year. Some dialogues tickle your bone in a very unconvential smart way. There is no toilet humor and it doesn't hurt your intelligence. The acting is very good and it is easy to relate to all characters without them seeming corny or ridiculously exuberant for any reason.

2912755,5,B000TZJBP6,"In the movie Knocked Up, Katherine Heigl plays Alison Scott, a twenty-something career gal who has just been promoted to an on-air position with E! Entertainment Television. The day she receives her promotion Alison goes out to celebrate with her older sister, Debbie, at a nightclub. It's there that she meets Ben, an unmotivated pothead who lives with four roommates and doesn't have a job ""per se."" Ben and his roommates are working on creating a Web site that will allow you to search for your favorite actress's nude scenes. When Ben and Allison meet, even though she's gorgeous and he's a pudgy, hairy mess, there's something about his personality and charm that wins her over. Eventually they wind up back at her place and you can guess from the title what happens next.

Knocked Up is the story of the way that Alison and Ben have to navigate an unplanned pregnancy and what it will mean for their individual futures, the future of their unborn child, and their collective relationship. It goes over every aspect of an unplanned pregnancy: do we or don't we have it?, what's going to happen to my career?, is this the right person for me? All of these questions are tackled in an honest and humorous fashion. And, even if you aren't into it for the pregnancy angle, there's so much more to the movie. Alison's sister has been married with children for a few years and feels that her relationship is stagnating. Her husband, played by Paul Rudd, is in no such rut and instead manages to be completely oblivious to his wife's concerns. Ben's roommates, also unmotivated potheads, have to figure out what to do if their planned celebrity sex scene Web site doesn't pan out the way they'd planned. As a whole, Knocked Up was just an all around interesting and multifaceted romantic comedy. And it doesn't hurt that the movie was downright hilarious.

Knocked Up is the sort of movie you can see with a friend, family member, or significant other and everyone will have something to laugh about. I can't remember the last time I was at a movie where every seat was filled and everyone laughed pretty much the whole time. It's definitely going to top the list of one of the funniest movies of the summer.",1188172800,3,2206,4.668380462724936

But if you just watch it for what it is (a movie) then it can be really hilarious at times.

2912757,4,B000TZJBP6,"I never did like that Paul Anka song, but it came to mind when watching this movie.

Havin' a baby
What a perfect way of proving
When you've been easy
Havin' a baby
What a simple way of knowing
You were drunk and crazy
I can see it, nausea's growing
I can see it in your eyes
You're not happy to know it
That you're havin' a baby.

Yep, as the title of the movie will confirm, one night of drunken partying can lead to a barely remembered episode of making unprotected whoopee, which in turn can lead to the predicament of Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl of Grey's Anatomy).

Recently promoted at work, Alison hopes that the camera will hide the pounds she's beginning to pack as she tries to deal with the new developments in her life.  Unfortunately, the father-to-be (Seth Rogen) isn't exactly ideal family material, being a stranger to details like work and responsibility, but to his credit he doesn't break the record for the 100 meter sprint and tries to do the right thing.

They have so little in common that it's a wonder that the little cells managed to get together in the first place, but then again, Alison's sister (Leslie Mann) and her husband (Paul Rudd) aren't doing so great either.

Funny in places, but long and drawn out in others, this could have been a really good one hour sitcom episode, but at more than two hours, you may experience birthing pains before the credits begin to roll.

Rated 3.5 stars

(Note: Profanity laden, with adult situations, and may be traumatic to people who are pregnant for the first time.)

2912761,5,B000TZJBP6,"""Knocked Up"" is truely one of those films that creeps up from behind you and really surprises you in every sense of the word. What could have easily been a dumb, forgettable, raunchy sex-comedy turns out to be a smart, memorable, raunchy sex/romantic comedy. It's a well balanced high wire act of potty mouthed humor mixed with sweet and sensitive elements that is pulled off brilliantly by the writing and direction of Mr. Judd Apatow as well as the acting from actors like Seth Rogen, Katherine Heigl, Paul Rudd, and the under appreciated Leslie Mann (not to exclude the supporting roles from Jonah Hill, Jason Sigel, and a few other ""Freaks and Geeks""/""Undeclared"" alumni).
""Knocked Up"" is a pretty simple story: a likable under achiever/slacker/stoner/unemployed goofball has a lucky one night stand with a gorgeous woman who was drunk from celebrating a promotion she earned at work. The couple's one hot night turns out to be a nine month ""getting to know you and your friends"" bit before the baby pops out. Of course there are moments where the boy must grow up, mature if you will, which is truely what the film is all about. The running time is 129 minutes which may be a little too long for some but honestly, I hardly noticed it and I've seen this in theaters twice! From start to finish Apatow pulls the audience in with his great sense of humor and scene after scene the laughs keep rolling in til the end just as fresh as it was in the begining.
Though ""Knocked Up"" is pretty fowl mouthed, (the ""F"" word is thrown around a lot as well as a whole avalanche of various naughty words) the film has the amazing ability to become extremely sensitive and even sweet.

From the proud parents of the hit comedy The 40 Year Old Virgin and featuring several members of that cast, Knocked Up is nicely surprising in that it grows beyond its original premise. Leading man Seth Rogan is very funny and definitely in his comfort zone with this kind of material. Katherine Heigl of Grey's Anatomy is new to the cast from The 40 Year Old Virgin gang but she blends in just fine, and although many of the gags aren't made by her, many wouldn't be so hilarious without her. The jokes are generally very funny but there are the occasional sex and movie references which not all audience members will understand however. And watch out for the really entertaining supporting character performance from actress Kristen Wig as Katherine Heigl's jealous co-worker.

The female lead, Katherine Heigl, is a beautiful up and coming journalist with the E! network.  Their backgrounds are light years apart.

Let's face it: comedy is in pretty sorry shape these days and when something halfway decent (like this flick) comes out, critics (and a lot of regular folk) wildly over-praise it.  It was ""cute,"" not hilarious.  The pros: a lively, game cast that is perfectly attuned to Apatow's sensibility and Heigl is very easy on the eyes.  The cons: way, way, way too long.  I'd rather have this than an ""Evan Almighty"" or ""A Night at the Museum"" any day but this is nowhere near a comedy classic - don't buy into all the hype.  If you go in expecting a mildly good time, you will probably end up pleasantly satisfied.  Oh, and seeing Harold Ramis pop up in a cameo made me wish the film was up to level of ""Animal House"" or ""Groundhog Day.""",1182988800,,1477,4.570342205323194

Thats what the movie ""Knocked Up"" is, a mixture between funny and serious moments. It's basically a movie about an unexpected pregnancy by Ben Stone and Alison Scott (Seth Rogan and Katherine Heigl respectively) and what they go through between conception and the actual birth spun out into a whole movie over the 40 week period. Alison is more of the mature female who lives with her sister and her husband and Ben is more of the party type, weed smoking guy who meets her at a bar. The movie has it's funny moments that will make you laugh, a mixture between married couples (although Alison and Ben wern't married) and weed smoking with you buddies humor. It also has it's serious moments where the message is sent about responsibility (seeing that you're pregnant and giving birth soon), and how to take care of yourself and what you have to do when it comes to sacrifices. Even parts where they were supposed to be serious were funny (you'll laugh, trust me). Plus there is some sexual humour there as well. For the longest time, I didn't believe Alison was pregnant (seriously, I thought it was a big joke). Parts of this movie will jump out at you, so be ready.

2912775,5,B000TZJBP6,"Alison Scott (Heigl) is an up-and-comer who has just received a promotion at the E! Entertainment network, and will now be doing on-air interviews.  Ben Stone (Rogan) is a slacker who watches movies for nude scenes so he can post the info on a Mr. Skin-type website he and his buddies are creating.  He also likes to smoke pot and just hang out. Alison's and Ben's paths cross on the night of her promotion, and after a few drinks have a one night stand.  Two months later, their misunderstanding they had about condom use, comes back to haunt them as Alison discovers she is pregnant.  Ben and Alison decide to give it a shot and get to know each other, since either way, their lives are now entwined.

Director Judd Apatow's follow up to ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"" shows that he is a gifter writer and director.  ""Knocked Up"" has all the charm of his first film, and is excellent.  Heigl and Rogan are a cute couple, and have great chemistry.  Rogan is hilarious as usual, and this could very well be a breakout role for him.  The rest of the cast is pulled from Apatow's previous works ""Freaks and Geeks"" and ""Undeclared"".  His wife and kids are even in the film, and it is obvious these people all enjoy working together.  ""Knocked Up"" is a rare movie that will satisfy both men and women.  I highly recommend this film.  It is probably the funniest movie out there since ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"", and well worth your time.",1182124800,,1425,4.476744186046512
2912776,4,B000TZJBP6,"""Knocked Up"" is a breath of fresh air. It's crude and juvenile, tender and perceptive all at once. There are some stretches that drag a bit (it could have been tightened up a bit), but when it is funny, it's a real hoot!

The characters are flawed and a bit stereotypical, but each has a drop of authenticity that makes them believable and sympathetic. Rogen's stoner is clueless and self-absorbed as you would expect, but his performance is believable when he gradually discovers his responsible self, because he shows us that he has never found it only because he has never had any reason to look before.

Katherine Heigl is believable, because as a decent as well as beautiful woman, you can imagine that she has probably has her share of come-ons from handsome jerks and that she finds Rogen's low-key self-deprecating persona non-threatening enough to think him no threat until alcohol removes her defences.

It's a bit over-hyped, but overall is a good-hearted satisfying time-waster with a sharp adolescent wit and a surprising amount of insight into the situations it pokes fun at.",1182124800,2,1089,4.907608695652174
2912777,2,B000TZJBP6,"Judd Apatow's Knocked Up seems like a comedy that couldn't work on paper, but the way the film starts out you may be thinking differently.  For a good amount of time, Knocked Up is a vulgarly funny comedy that finds Seth Rogen and hottie Katherine Heigl as mis-matched mates whose one night stand escalates into said pregnancy.  From that point forward though, Apatow tries way too hard to get into the character's heads, and towards the end of the film, throws one non-sensical leap of logic at you right after the other.  There are some highpoints here though, most notably with the supporting cast.  Rogen, in his first starring role, is decent enough, but the best moments definitely go to Paul Rudd as the jaded husband of Heigl's sister (Leslie Mann).  Harold Ramis is on board as well as Rogen's father, who it's always good to see on screen, even if it's all too brief.  In the end, Knocked Up ends up being a typical and predictable (not to mention overlong) mainstream comedy that doesn't push boundaries nearly as far as it thinks it does, and despite it's game cast and occasionally funny moments, Knocked Up isn't anything you haven't seen before and probably seen better.",1181952000,5,1185,4.728155339805825
2912778,4,B000TZJBP6,"""Knocked Up"", the new comedy written and directed by Judd Apatow (""The 40 Year Old Virgin, TV's ""Freaks & Geeks""), starring Seth Rogen and Kathryn Heigl (TV's ""Grey's Anatomy""), continues the traditions of the director's previous film; it's really funny. And for many of the same reasons.

Ben (Rogen) and his friends are a group of slackers. They sit around all day, getting high, trying to figure out the easiest, fastest way to make enough money to sustain their lifestyle. What do they come up with? A website listing the exact moment stars get naked in their films. Strangely, this pursuit doesn't take up a lot of their time so they sit around and talk, debating the most miniscule things about topics that are the most important thing in the world to them. But to everyone else? They merely shake their heads in disbelief. They make a bet with Martin (Martin Starr) that he can't go a whole year without shaving. If he loses, he pays their rent for a year. If he wins, they pay his rent for a year. They all live together in a ramshackle house, the type of house with an overgrown yard and half filled pool, in one of the neighborhoods surrounding Los Angeles. One night, Seth and Jason (Jason Sigel) go out to a bar with their friends. As they wait in line to get in, two pretty women walk right up and gain access to the club.

Allison (Kathryn Heigl) is a young producer at E! Entertainment Television. A hard worker and the celebrities like her, she receives some good news; her boss (Alan Tudyk) wants to put her on camera. To celebrate, she and her sister, Debbie (Leslie Mann, wife of director Apatow and the drunk blind date in ""The 40 Year Old Virgin""), leave the husband, Pete (Paul Rudd) in charge of watching their kids and head out to the club. They walk up to the front of the line and immediately get in.

Debbie (Mann) and Pete (Paul Rudd) have a weird relationship. They have two kids, and she constantly wonders if he is cheating on her; he has to leave at odd hours to `check out bands' (he works in the music industry) and she suspects he is out to meet girls.

At the nightclub, Ben meets Allison and they both get really drunk. The next morning, he wakes up to find they had sex the night before. Eight weeks later, Allison learns she is pregnant.

I have merely scratched the surface; ""Knocked Up"" has so much more going on. But I wanted to introduce you to the three sets of characters who occupy this story. It is these characters, their lives, their friendships, their interactions, and their philosophies, which form the heart of the comedy.

If we saw a film with just Ben and his friends, we would probably be happy. They sit around and make bets and basically waste time, so they don't have to go out and get a job. Their idea for a website allows them to sit around and watch scenes from other films, concentrating on the ""good parts"". Each of the friends has a relationship with another person that helps to provide an interesting twist to their group dynamic. At one point, we meet a young woman who is apparently the girlfriend of Martin, but she is too stoned to reveal much. At other points, various guys reveal they have other sexual relationships, both committed and experimental, most of which provide additional laughs.

When the gang goes to the nightclub, Ben has a moment with Allison where they make a connection. But the moment soon passes and he goes back to talk with Jason who realizes she has her sister with her. Jason offers to run interference. They approach the girls and Jason begins to hit on Debbie, a married woman. He is so persuasive that we get it. And she starts to become a little giddy with the attention.

This group is also the most outrageous part of the film. They are damn funny, often making us laugh with some outrageous statement or image. But the brilliance of this film is that this outrageous behavior is offset, and complimented, by two other groups.

Kathryn Heigl basically plays the straight woman to Seth Rogen's funny guy. Allison is the more human, emotional center of the story. She isn't very funny, but is a necessary part of the film's success. If everyone were off the wall, ""Knocked Up"" wouldn't work because there would be no basis in reality. She is the key to making the film seem more real.

But her own funny people surround her, from her boss and his assistant (Kristen Wiig, TV's ""Saturday Night Live"") at E! to her sister and brother-in-law, everyone has a quirky personality, and these help to add depth and interest to an already funny film.

Then, the film adds Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd, as Allison's sister and brother-in-law. Both were very funny in Apatow's ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"". Here, they are paired and add another level of eccentricity to the film. Rudd is a bit sarcastic, and feels put upon by his responsibilities as a father and husband. Mann has much insecurity and suspects her husband of cheating on her, but she isn't above using the relationship to get what she wants. They have allowed Allison to move into the guesthouse in the back, so they are always in each other's lives, often to comic effect.

Apatow has a real sense of capturing these eccentric characters in an extremely natural way. I know they are acting like clowns, but the director makes them appear human and life like. No small feat. He also has a great ear for dialogue and many lines made me laugh out loud because they so brilliantly captured the feelings and character of the people saying them. This doesn't happen that often, so when it does, I really notice.

""Knocked Up"" captures the details of their relationship in a believable, honest way. When Allison realizes she is pregnant, and whom she was with when this happened, she becomes distraught. Allison doesn't even know the guy and what she learns about him doesn't assuage her fears. But because she is pregnant with Ben's baby, they spend time together and they actually learn good things about each other, learn to care about each other. They fall in love, naturally and gradually. Allison even begins to adopt some of his likes and habits. And he tries. He tries very hard.

""Knocked Up"" is less successful when it tries to capture the entire story of their pregnancy. Throughout, a title comes up to reveal the state of the pregnancy at that time. This helps to guide us through the story, but it also makes it seem episodic. And because we realize soon enough that we will be watching the entire relationship, good and bad, funny and sad, it makes the film feel longer in a way. We sort of anticipate that not everything will be funny and when it isn't, these scenes wear a little thin.

But this is a minor complaint in an overall excellent, very funny, adult comedy.

Rogen and Apatow have been busy; they have another film coming out this summer. Both served as producers and Rogen wrote the screenplay for ""Superbad"" which appears to be adapted from Rogen's own childhood. In fact, Jonah Hill who plays the Rogen character in ""Superbad"" plays one of his buddies, Jonah (are you sensing the trend?) in ""Knocked Up"". If ""Superbad"" is anywhere near as good, and Apatow thinks it is better, we are in for another treat this summer.",1181692800,,7194,4.582426127527216
2912779,3,B000TZJBP6,"First, a confession - I did not like another movie by this director, The 40 Year Old Virgin. But this movie was actually pleasurable, although it isn't stellar. If you believe that opposites attract when it comes to romance, you may find this believable. Basically, a goofball guy falls into bed with a far different type of person and she gets pregnant. That is the set-up for the rest of the movie. The main characters, guy and woman,play their parts relatively seriously, compared to the supporting actors (who go far to enliven this movie).

  Anyway, this was a fine way to spend a night at the movies. The jokes come fast and furiously but you know what they say about humor - it can be tricky to create comedy that appeals to everyone. For me, this just wasn't above 3 stars in that department.

  Some of you, I'm sure, will find this far more delightful than I did so I hesitate to discourage you from seeing it. As I noted above, I found this enjoyable, but it didn't stick in my memory for more than a few hours after leaving the theatre.

2912781,4,B000TZJBP6,"I'm usually fairly skeptical about movies like Knocked Up.  The previews made it seem like it was either a sentimental chick flick or a gross out comedy, two genres that I can usually do without.  In reality it's kind of a combination of both, with a little bit of slacker humor thrown in for good measure.  But if a chick flick and a gross out comedy can be done well, then Judd Apatow succeeds in making this one of the funniest (and best) movies that I've seen all year.

Knocked Up is about a 20 something slacker named Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) who basically does nothing all day but smoke pot and work on a website that tells people where nude scenes are in movies.  One night he meets beautiful Allison Scott (Katherine Heigl), an entertainment reporter for E at a club.  One thing leads to another and the two wind up in bed and Allison gets pregnant.  The rest of the movie shows Allison and Ben trying to put together a relationship, all the while watching Allison's sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) and Pete's (Paul Rudd) marriage go through ups and downs.

With Knocked Up, Apatow continues his winning streak, creating yet another very funny, and sometimes meaningful and poignant comedy.  There are some very hilarious scenes throughout the movie.  The opening title sequence is hilarious, with Ben and his stoner buddies goofing around to Shimmy Shimmy Ya by Ol' Dirty Bastard.  The scene where Allison and Ben try to have sex while she's pregnant is very funny, and the interaction between Pete and Ben is hilarious because it's so dorky.  But Knocked Up also has some fairly poignant moments.  There is a lot of talk about the importance of love and commitment in a relationship.  Apatow has crafted a movie that isn't simply a bunch of goofs and stoner jokes, but actually has a heart and something important to say.

One of the best things about Knocked Up is how tossed off everything feels.  It really does not feel like there is much acting going on here.  There is a fair bit of improvisation thrown around, and everyone in the cast has great chemistry.  Ben and Allison are both awkward at first but grow to love each other.  All of Ben's stoner friend's act like they've been friends for years and probably have.  Debbie and Pete portray perfectly a dysfunctional marriage.  Pete and Ben's hyper literate conversations come off like they have them all the time.  Every character is so well drawn and they all interact so perfectly that it doesn't really feel like your watching a movie.

I highly recommend this movie to people who enjoy good comedy and a good story with some heart.  I look forward to what Apatow can come up with next, and I look forward to Superbad, which Seth Rogen co-wrote.  It should be hilarious.  And the music in the movie was awesome.",1181088000,2,2779,4.6204081632653065

This film is a fitting follow-up to that wildly funny film.

As Alison Scott, we're not quite sure why she connects with Ben Stone.  He seems like such a strange slacker.  But given the pregnancy, she tries to explore a relationship with him and grows to love him.  This may be the most difficult part of the film to accept.

Paul Rudd who was in ""The 40-Year-Old-Virgin,"" ""Night at the Museum,"" ""The Ex,"" & ""Clueless"" does a good job as Pete the brother-in-law who loves fantasy baseball.

The Apatows' real life daughters Iris & Maude play Debbie's two daughters in the film.

Martin Starr plays Martin who makes a bet and has to grow a beard in the film.  He played with Heigl in three episodes of ""Roswell.""  His stone-faced performance is funny in a very low-key, low-energy way.  Harold Ramis has a nice cameo as Ben's dad.

I laughed hard during this movie.  It touches some of the most basic needs of both men and women, to be fathers and mothers and do right by our children.  Through Paul Rudd's and Katherine Heigl's characters, it also explores the balance between what we need as individuals, our ""me-time,"" and what we devote of ourselves to our families.  The drug scene stuff didn't add a lot to the film for me, but maybe some of the more youthful members of the audience had fun with that.  I found this to be a sparkling comedy, well worth the time.

2912783,1,B000TZJBP6,"My friend, who never walks out of movies, nearly left ""Knocked Up"" in the middle.  I won't say the film was that bad, but it's certainly not worth the $6.50 matinee price.  Unless this type of movie is really your cuppa, I definitely do not suggest purchasing the DVD.  (Although the soundtrack has some definite possibilities)

Heigl and Rogen didn't spark. I couldn't figure out precisely what Heigl saw in Rogen at the first bar scene when she was clean and sober.  I realize they're supposed to be different, but even after the scenes called for them to be a couple, they weren't believable enough to seem real.

The humor was elementary kid level disgusting, for example, telling how Rogen's 3 male roomies got pinkeye.  I can see boys under the age of 12 laughing at that, but most of the women sitting around me were openly disgusted.

I don't object to swearing, but if every other word is an epithet, I tend to tune out.  Clearly, the screenwriter didn't go to too much effort to make interesting dialog.

""Knocked Up"" may well be, as one reviewer suggested, great birth control, but probably for females only.",1181001600,13,1119,4.663265306122449
2912784,4,B000TZJBP6,"From its title alone, you might expect ""Knocked Up"" to take a cavalier approach to pregnancy and children. Actually, it is a very sweet (if horrifically and often comically vulgar) film that among other things explores the vastly divergent perspectives of men and women on marriage, sexuality and kids.

The film's premise is simple enough. Up-and-coming TV personality Alison Scott gets pregnant after an unprotected encounter with frumpy barely-employed Ben Stone. Scott immediately switches into lost-career mom mode. She worries about whether to keep the baby, how and whether to involve Stone and whether to tell her image-stupid network about her figure-altering new reality. Meanwhile, she tries to sound out Stone as a potential caregiver. Though very smart, compassionate and honorable, he is basically a doofus -- an immature stoner in a dead-end, though high-tech job who has no clue that his vapid crudities are offending the sensibilities of his putative partner.

The acting in ""Knocked up,"" especially the notable job done by leads Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl, is believable and sweet. The writing is smart and very funny. And the characters are terrific. Scott's sister is struggling in her marriage, giving the film a chance to explore the hidden stresses in couples trying to be good parents and spouses wghile retaining some sense of youth and independence. Stone's band of porn-addled, weed-smoking bon vivants is a hilariously well-drawn portrait of the moral and cultural stupor that envelops at least some young males. When an earthquake hits and Stone saves his bong rather than his pregnant girlfriend, you have almost everything you need to know about how far this young man has to travel. Seeing Stone make that hard choice tells you that there is a good chance he'll make the trip.

I saw ""Knocked Up"" with a group of 150 just-graduated high school seniors. In spite of the constant profanity, the several sex scenes and the endless pot smoking, this film had a lot to say about the need to grow up and smell the talcum powder. Though not meant as a sex ed film, the movie made clear what happens when a baby is coming into the world. Babies mean imperfect relationships, hard choices, making a living, letting go of stupid habits and dealing with ""crowning"" and other gynecological concepts not appealing to most men. To have that message delivered -- even with a whopping dose of bad behavior -- is not a bad thing at all.",1180915200,5,2455,4.982926829268293
2912785,4,B000TZJBP6,"I thought the film was well done. It's fairly common today for people to forget that movies are surreal. As in they are not always an accurate reflection of reality, even if they portray familiar situations, environments, and interactions. While I laughed throughout the film, I can see that this movie is not going to be a hit with everyone. As a guy who has been lumped into the ""dork"" category before, I can say that this appeals to a younger audience of social misfits. The premise of the film is stretched thin at times, but the characters grow and seem mostly real, with a few exceptions. There were plenty of one-liners and raunchy humor balanced by genuinely endearing moments. The inconsistency and heavy reliance on juvenile humor made this a four star film for me, but it was still worth seeing in a theater, if only to laugh aloud with the audience.

===POINT/COUNTERPOINT***

1. Stoner and Juvenile Humor: The movie was inundated with pot-related references and jokes, including creative/adaptive smoking (fishbowl, gas mask, etc), simulated gay sex scenes while Ben (Seth Rogen) talks to his pregnant one night stand, a group of deadbeat post HS kids who live in a communal environment...the list goes on.

My Response: Yes, the movie was rife with jokes that spoke mainly to the younger, desensitized generation. They did get old in places, but the argument here returns to understanding the demographic. Let's pretend this storyline took place between a man and woman in their late thirties instead of their early to mid twenties. The situations, characters, humor, and their friends, would be entirely different. These are not typical but fictional portrayals of a geek and his friends, and it's true to form.

2. Profanity: It appeared that none of the characters were capable of expressing themselves without inserting expletives into their interactions.

My response: I agree for the most part. There could have been less swearing, but as with most Hollywood flicks aimed at young adults these days, it seems to be par for the course. We've been desensitized. Plus, the movie was supposed to be raunchy. Usually raunch and profanity go hand in hand.

3. Character Development: The movie focuses too deeply upon Ben and does not develop Alison. We see her on the fringes, a woman living in her sister's backyard apartment, consumed only by her work (we see her interact with friends [or ""Frenemies"" as Carina Chocano calls them in her LA Times review] only once). As the movie unfolds it appears that the best thing to have happened to this woman over the course of her life is her promotion and having this misadventure. Surely this character could and should be more multidimensional.

My response:Yes and no. The main character of this movie is Ben, and the plot line focuses on him and his friends. Therefore we largely view the rest of the characters in the film through the lens of his perspective. I agree that there should have been a bit more character development of Alison, but the movie was already getting dangerously long.

4. Sex Scenes: They were unnecessary.

My response: The movie did not need them. While there were some funny moments, they did not add to the film, and may have alienated a more mature audience even more so than the profanity and juvenile humor (we all were kids at some point and can relate on that level at least). I will again return to the argument that the younger generations (X, Y, Millenials) have been desensitized through television to these matters. I would argue that the sex scenes could have been replaced with more background and development of Alison, or inclusion of the parents to a greater extent.

5. Credibility: There were some incongruities in the film that were difficult to ignore, such as Ben being able to miraculously conjure a white-collar web design job and lush apartment on the fly, the lack of involvement on the parents' behalf, especially towards the end, etc.

My response: Credibility is only an issue if you allow it to become one. The average film today is somewhere between an hour and a half to two hours long. Any longer and it becomes a struggle to hold the audience's interest. The film was already pushing two hours in length, and to include some subplot about how he landed the job or apartment, or greater involvement from the parents, would have drawn the film into dangerous territory with regards to its length. My argument here is simple: SUSPEND YOUR DISBELIEF.",1180915200,,4470,4.860709592641261
2912792,3,B000TZJBP6,"It's a classic scenario: a boy and a girl have a one-night stand, resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. This is the idea behind ""Knocked Up,"" an occasionally funny but mostly overdone examination of compatibility and inevitable change. I probably would have liked this film more if it had relied on a subtler sense of humor; the jokes and one-liners in this film are aggressively in-your-face, so much so that they overshadow the more serious (and more compelling) aspects of the story. Themes of coming to terms with parenthood and building relationships are definitely there, but they're not as prominent as they should be; it seems as if more time was spent on four-letter words and scenes of drug use. It wouldn't be enough to say that this film is vulgar, and it certainly wouldn't be truthful to say that a few select lines of dialogue weren't funny. Still, I would have preferred a film that was a bit more restrained.

In the middle of this less-than-ideal situation are Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) and Ben Stone (Seth Rogen), who meet at a club, drink themselves silly, and ultimately sleep together. Their separate lives couldn't be anything less alike, which--dramatically speaking--makes for a more interesting plot. Alison is a hard-working up-and-comer for the E! Network; Ben is a jobless slacker who spends most of his time getting stoned with his roommates. The two meet at a local dance club, where Alison is celebrating her promotion to On-Camera Interviewer and Ben is just being Ben. Their coming together under the influence is realistic, as is the fact that Alison is attracted to an average-looking man (""You're prettier than I am,"" Ben so aptly remarks just before they have sex).

What isn't quite so realistic is what follows the one-night stand. Eight weeks later, Alison finally discovers that she's pregnant, much to her shock and dismay. What follows is a nine-month odyssey for she and Ben to get to know each other, an odyssey highlighted by countless arguments and endless discussions of how relationships should work. I tried my hardest to invest in these characters, but something just wasn't clicking with me. I never once believed that these two would realistically be able come to an understanding, even over the smallest of issues; such opposing personalities are too ingrained to allow for any flexibility. But within the context of this story, Ben and Alison are always able to patch things up (if only for a brief time, after which they go through the process all over again). By the time their baby is actually born, all traces of plausibility have been lost.

I even found myself criticizing the logistics of their financial situations (I know I'm not supposed to do that, but when it comes to a story involving a pregnancy, certain things just can't be dismissed). First off, Alison is living with her married sister, Debbie (Leslie Mann). This doesn't make sense; working for a major television network would result in an above average salary, meaning there would be no reason to live in someone else's home. If there's anyone who should be living with family for financial reasons, it would be Ben, hands down; not only is he unemployed, he lives with a group of people who don't seem to be working, either. How, pray tell, are they paying for rent, food, and utilities? At one point, Ben explains that a minor accident ten years ago resulted in a $10,000 settlement, and he's been living off of that money ever since. I find this very hard to believe; in today's day and age, that amount of money could never be stretched out so long.

But in the scheme of things, I'm just nitpicking. The real problems of this film stem from an overactive sense of humor; ten minutes can't go by without yet another dirty joke being told. To be fair, some of them were quite funny (and since none of them can be repeated publicly, you'll have to take my word for it). But after a while, it begins to get stale and repetitive, like a good scene that turns bad after being forced to watch it over and over. It doesn't help that the film is surprisingly slow-paced, with much of the screen time spent on characters that didn't need to be so well developed. Case in point: Debbie and her husband, Pete (Paul Rudd), serving as a sign of things to come for Ben and Alison. Debbie is a viper-tongued control freak, never afraid to express her opinions on anything. Pete is a pent up volcano waiting to erupt, a man struggling to find some middle ground in his marriage. Because of frequent late-night outings, Debbie begins to suspect that he's been unfaithful. I won't say whether or not this is the case, but I will say that it doesn't really matter; this is supposed Ben and Allison's story.

I sound like I'm absolutely trashing ""Knocked Up,"" but in all honesty, some things about it work well. The most interesting character in the entire film is Sadie (Maude Apatow), Pete and Debbie's young daughter; at one point, she admits that she Googled the word ""murder,"" only to find pictures of dead people lying in pools of blood. That was funny, as was her description of where babies come from--a description most likely influenced by her search of the word ""murder."" I also liked the pop culture references, most of which directly connect to Alison's position at the E! Network. The most memorable reference is a cameo by Ryan Seacrest; he rants like an over-pampered celebrity would, intentionally poking fun at his own Hollywood stature. Granted, such moments are not important to the plot; we're supposed to focus on an unplanned pregnancy. Indeed, we do, but not wholeheartedly. Ultimately, I can only give ""Knocked Up"" credit for trying (pun definitely intended).",1180828800,6,5700,4.80632008154944
2912793,1,B000TZJBP6,"My husband and I went to see this movie after reading several glowing reviews.  Unfortunately, the reviews failed to mention the non-stop string of extremely offensive language and downright gross ""humor"" (e.g., a wife talking to her sister about her husband's masturbation, simulated sex by 5 guys while one of them talks to his pregnant one-night stand on the phone, a reference to Meg Ryan's ""b*sh,"" etc.).  The ""F"" word is used over and over to the point that it is grating.  We don't know many people who can't form a sentence without it, but in this movie, that appears to be the case.  A potentially interesting plot is buried under gratuitous disgusting situations that add nothing to the film.  The writers could have made their point without 99% of the filth that was in this picture.  There is nothing ""smart"" about it, as was said in the reviews; this film simply appeals to the lowest common denominator and goes for the cheap laugh--except we almost never laughed.  We have watched less offensive porn.  At least with that, you know what you're about to watch.  The movie is masquerading as a comedy, and a lot of people are going to be in for a big surprise.  We made it 40 minutes before deciding there are much better ways to spend our time.  We only regret that we didn't ask for our money back.  What a waste.",1180828800,10,1328,4.580508474576271
2912794,5,B000TZJBP6,"- REVIEW

I guess it shouldn't surprised me that ""Knocked Up"" is a well-crafted movie that's in league with the best of comedy films.  Judd Apatow has a way with treating its characters with sincerity and unpretentiousness, even when the characters are crass in nature.  It's easier to see that from his involvement with shows such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freaks-and-Geeks/dp/B0001EQHXO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freaks and Geeks</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undeclared/dp/B00092ZM7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undeclared</a>, right before he take a role into filmmaking and made the funniest film I've seen in a long while,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-40-Year-Old-Virgin/dp/B000E6V07M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 40-Year-Old Virgin</a>. With ""Knocked Up"", he found the right balance of laugh-out-loud comedy with awkward yet authentic drama.  It's a marginally more serious film than Apatow's last film, which for all its moments of humorous grandeur, it hits me on how troubling it is for being an expected parent.

Like director Christopher Guest before him, Apatow brings most of the cast from his past works to appear in this film, with the likes of Jason Segel as one of Seth Rogen's drunk buddies and Leslie Mann as the sister of Kathernine Heigl's character, along with cameos such as James Franco and Steve ""the virgin"" Carell himself.  However, I must say it's awkward to see Martin Starr's character having a beard and not wearing glasses, yet still has that ""Geek"" voice.  The only new cast member in the film is Katherine Heigl, who plays as a E! News worker who had a one-night stand with Seth Rogen's character, and you know what happens next.  It might be perplexing that a woman like her might have relations with a guy like him, but let's put this into consideration: she got involved with a mental-challenged person in ""The Ringer"", so she's pretty easy.  The ensemble are funny and well-acted in their own way.

As said before, this movie is laugh-out-loud funny, even when the trailer didn't make it as a such.  It's vulgar, sure, but almost every scene hits the punchline, like when the Ben (Seth) and his buddies are simulating sex, or when the couple tries different unusual doctors, or the whole ""Las Vegas"" scene; it can be even funny for the ladies with scenes dealin' with Leslie and Katherine. ""Knocked Up"" rarely missed a beat.  I'll be honest, it's not quite as hilarious as ""Virgin"", but this is a type of film that's more down-to-earth.

Even as a comedy, when it gets down to the relationship between Ben and Alison (Katherine), it's a serious affair.  Sure, it's funny when both tried to get along , getting baby supplies and being sexually intimate, but for some scenes they can be uncomfortable to watch, and I say it as a good thing.  They felt that because of their unborn child, they are suppose to connect, but it turns out to be very difficult.  They go through the patterns of ups and downs, but the down moments made their relationship almost in peril.  With Ben, he doesn't know what he doing, and most times he ends up saying and doing the wrong things.  What's great about these up-and-down moments is that I can see the characters grow overtime, learning to take responsibilities and seeing most of the sub-characters grow to support the couple as well.  What's makes it even better is that development done in a non-chessy and unorthodox way.

At two hours and 13 minutes, it's one of the longest comedies ever made, but fortunately ""Knocked Up"" has such a good pace in providing both genres, so it doesn't feel long.  Seth Rogen started off as a forgettable cast member in the past, but here (and with the help of his mentor, Apatow) he knows how to play his role and ends up being a remarkable and likable person.  Judd Apatow made the relationship between two unlikely people work, and for that and everything this movie provides, ""Knocked Up"" is hilarious yet very sweet.  Heck, it certainly made my dad (who saw this movie with me) remember the times he had when my mom's about to have her first child; it was just as crazy as this movie portrays, making this film relatable to anyone in that position.

This is Del Keyes, giving his thumbs up to Judd.",1180828800,,4374,5.198005698005698
2912795,2,B000TZJBP6,"There are only a few things to like in this movie. First, two charming co-stars, unfortunately saddled with an empty script. Second, the movie depicts an unmarried couple who decide not to abort the baby they unintentionally conceive. That is a huge positive. Third, the reconciliation of a difficult relationship between these two people from vastly different backgrounds. A very good movie could have been built around these three positives. But, alas, the downside in this movie is that there is very little interesting or funny for anyone 17 years or over, as most of the dialogue is filled with gutter language and most of the ""jokes"" are scatological or drug-centered. If you are less than 17, you might like this movie, but you will have to attend in the company of an adult -- and that adult will not find much that is interesting or funny. Is this what entertainment has sunk to?",1180828800,7,888,4.7727272727272725
2912796,5,B000TZJBP6,"I just became a Seth Rogen fan. Just right now, I did. I've been peripherally aware of this guy, having seen him in miniscule parts in ANCHORMAN: THE LEGEND OF RON BURGUNDY, YOU, ME & DUPREE, and, most notably, THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN. But, here in KNOCKED UP, he takes lead actor honors and he's wonderful. See this movie for the other actors, as well - Katherine Heigl, Paul Rudd, and Leslie Mann all shine - but, in my eyes, this is a cinematic coming out party for Seth Rogen. And, if nothing else, this chubby guy gives hope to uncool, unhandsome, plain folks like me. So, yay.

This is the story of Ben and Alison. Ben (Seth Rogen) is a laid-back and unemployed teddy bear of a guy who whiles away his time smoking weed and, with his slacker buddies, striving to construct a celebrity skin website (that these guys are unaware of the Mr. Skin site, already in place, seems far fetched). In a club, he bumps into out-of-his-league Alison (Katherine Heigl), a gorgeous career girl celebrating a promotion. Booze is poured, a spark is ignited, and Alison and Ben hook up. As sometimes happen, the next morning opens with hangovers and regrets and a butt-crack. Alison gets a good, sober look at Ben, who then doesn't help his case by throwing up and then championing the merits of post-drunk vomiting. Disgusted, Alison departs; Ben knows he goofed and assumes that that was that. But, 8 weeks later, Ben hears from Alison, who drops the news that she's expecting. And, because Ben is innately a good guy and Alison a fairly open-minded girl who doesn't want to do this alone, they make a go of being together.

This flick is a cheerful, very funny 2-hours-plus worth of sit down time and definitely offers more than its ANIMAL HOUSE tendencies would have you initially believe. My gut feeling is that the folks involved in the making of this film had true affection for it, especially Director/Writer Judd Apatow. KNOCKED UP lays down consistent humor foraying into occasional bawdiness. The film did startle me with its display of genuine emotion and heart. I was prepared to be content with cardboard people and cheap laughs. Instead, underneath the bawdy trimmings, the unaffected, heartfelt core of the film surfaced and made me invest in the characters beyond a superficial level. I really liked the characters. Too, the rampant crudity and lewdness of the film are balanced by a humorous yet sensitive depiction of a marriage quietly on the rocks, which, with all the insights given, actually feels like a real marriage.

Alison's older sister Debbie and Pete have been married for a while now and are raising two beautiful daughters. But life isn't like the movies, and Debbie and Pete, well-meaning people both, have problems. Debbie as played with delirious, high-strung brittleness by Leslie Mann is one of those pushy, righteous people who eventually gets under your skin, but she's not a bad person. Paul Rudd is comic gold as Pete, the fount of masterfully sly and dry comments, who can mostly tolerate Debbie's harangues but only if he gets the occasional alone time. Their not-quite-rosy relationship is plentifully plumbed, giving rise to spousal suspicions and bickerings and possibly previewing what the future holds for Alison and Ben. Too, Alison and Ben end up choosing sides as Alison is strictly with her sister while Ben espouses Pete's side. This puts a decided crimp in their own relationship.

Of course, this movie hinges on the leads' ability to generate interest and invoke sympathy from the viewer. And, let's face it, who wouldn't want Ben Stone for a buddy? Or Seth Rogen, for that matter? Ben is so good natured and easy going that I challenge anyone to not root for him and his maturation process. One of my favorite scenes is when he finally confronts Debbie. His chemistry with Heigl is apparent on screen; I can actually see this smoking hot girl being pals with and then falling for the prospectless, chubby but appealing loser, although, naturally, beer and possibly many shots of tequilla would have to be involved. Katherine Heigl had already turned my head with her performances in ROSWELL and THE RINGER. Here, much respect goes to Katherine as she shrugs off dignity and dives right into the thick of things. But, you know what, even when ignominiously suffering thru morning sickness, throwing hormonal hissy fits, or giving alarmingly painful birth, she maintains her full babefulness. As Alison,she comes across as an authentic person with an array of valid fears and insecurities. Katherine Heigl's good. And smoking hot.

The supporting players sparkle. Credit as a whole goes to Ben's insult-tossing cast of nowhere-headed pals, who may be hapless but are there for Ben. Two standouts are Ken Jeong as the strict and precise Asian doctor and SNL-er Kristen Wiig as some sort of network executive, she of the snide and off-the-wall verbal asides (""This is Hollywood. We don't like liars.""). Because Alison works for the E! network, we're treated to several cameos of famous folks playing themselves. Ryan Seacrest's lampooning of himself is a blast and it makes me like him a bit better.

I like to laugh and KNOCKED UP doled out laughter in multiple servings. Much of the humor is of the juvenile sort as a sizable chunk of the film is dedicated to the slacker amigos mercilessly bagging on each other. Your enjoyment of these jokes will depend on your pop-culture I.Q. (for example, do you know who Serpico is?). One guy who undertakes a shaving bet is incessantly strafed with facial hair insults (""Scorcese on coke"" ""Your face is like Robin William's knuckles.""). Be advised that there are moments here of THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY or AMERICAN PIE proportions. But, in the midst of the pot humor, the DeNiro impressions, and the scatalogical stuff, there's an unfeigned sweetness and moments of honest soul searching which resonate clearly, and, gullible goofball that I am, I was charmed. Don't be fooled by the raunchy and ""modern"" conventions here; this film is firmly centered on family values. Ben Stone might be an adult at 23 years old, but this is still a coming of age story.

In his first lead role, Seth Rogen emerges as the genial, scruffy heart of the film. Now that he has it, here's hoping he can sustain his leading man status. If the ungainly Jack Black can do it, why not Seth, who's more lovable and cuddly? But there are other actors in the film. Heigl, Rudd, and Mann do great being witty and poignant, argumentative and loving, and real. KNOCKED UP allows both genders to have their moments. In terms of who's funny, Rogen and Rudd definitely come through, but Heigl and especially Mann deliver their ample share of levity. Just wait for the scene with the stressed Debbie having a brutal yet uproarious conversation with the nightclub doorman. The movie also has that something which lesser films would kill for, which is chemistry among its stars. Chemistry abounds, between Rogen and Heigl, between Mann and Rudd, between Rogen and Rudd. So, yeah, there's all kinds of reasons to go see KNOCKED UP. The guys have the dirty, smutty humor and the smoking hot babes; for the girls, there's the pregnancy arc, a nice, unforced romance, as well as the sibling relationship of Alison and Debbie. Oh, and, apparently, Paul Rudd is a clever hunk and Seth Rogen is immensely huggable. But, me, I saw this to learn the dice move.",1180742400,3,7404,4.834384858044164

2912798,4,B000TZJBP6,"Like many romantic comedies these days, ""Knocked Up"" can seem a bit schizophrenic at times, straddling a fine line between salty language, sexual innuendo and crude sight gags on the one hand, and a foursquare endorsement of monogamy and marriage on the other.  The standard formula for such films is that the characters are allowed to be as promiscuous as they want to be in the early stages of the drama provided they see the error of their ways and settle into responsible domestic conformity by the time the closing credits come rolling by.

""Knocked Up"" goes a step further than most films in this genre by turning this theme - which is usually more implied than stated - into the very cornerstone of the movie itself.  Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) is a socially backward, unemployed, loser stoner who has a drunken one-night-stand with Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl), a beautiful, up-and-coming reporter for the E Channel.  When, in the stone-cold sober light of early morning, Alison sees who exactly it was she had sex with the night before, she essentially brushes Ben off, never expecting to really have to deal with him ever again.  Fate, however, has other plans, as she soon discovers that she is pregnant with Ben's baby.  Will Ben do the right thing by giving up his nerdish bachelor ways to marry Alison and be a true father to his child?  Will Alison overcome her initial repulsion to discover the true Ben and start a family with him? Even though the answers to those questions are never much in doubt given the nature of the genre, the movie has a great deal of fun getting to those answers..

This is writer/director Judd Apatow's highly anticipated follow-up to the wildly popular ""The 40 Year Old Virgin,"" a film that most people seemed to enjoy more than I did.  For despite some fine performances and some very funny moments, ""Virgin"" often seemed weighed down by both the implausibility of its premise and its dogmatic adherence to the overused ""Pygmalion"" formula.  Luckily, ""Knocked Up"" starts right off the bat with a more believable and compelling premise, which allows the audience to more clearly identify with the characters and their situations.  What separates ""Knocked Up"" from so many other generic romantic comedies is that Apatow has a sharp ear for the way people in the real world actually speak.  The lines are not only incisive, witty and sophisticated, but they are also what we would expect to hear coming out of the mouths of individuals caught in their particular situations.  He makes us laugh at all the foolishness, foibles and insecurities we ourselves are prone to as we cope with the often maddening complexities of human relationships.  Apatow also has a rare gift for making even the secondary characters compelling and interesting.  Thus, even though Ben and Alison are the primary focus of the movie, Alison's uptight sister, Debbie, and her beaten-down husband, Pete, are fully fleshed-out figures as well.  And even though Ben's loser roommates come across as fairly stereotypical zonked-out geeks and nerds, at least they are given some very funny one-liners to deliver as commentary on the main action.

However, all is not mere fun-and-games in this film.  Some of the fight scenes, for instance, are surprisingly raw and cutting in their no-holds-barred brutality and frankness, and many in the audience may find themselves squirming uncomfortably in recognition of things that they themselves have said or done in the heat of anger.  On a more upbeat note, Apatow also has a knack for inserting up-to-the-minute pop culture and movie references into the dialogue without making it feel desperate or forced.  This gives the movie an enjoyably  contemporary, ""with-it"" quality - although one wonders how far that may go towards limiting the shelf life of the movie in the long run, and how dated it may appear to audiences catching it on some cable station a decade or two from now.

Apatow is also to be commended for building his romantic comedy around a less-than-hunky male lead (although he doesn't have the nerve to go for a Plain Jane equivalent for  the distaff side of the equation).  It also helps that Rogen and Heigl are so utterly endearing in the roles of Ben and Alison, and that they receive such fine support from the likes of Paul Rudd, Leslie Mann and many others, including a handful of recognizable celebrities who make cameo appearances playing themselves.

It's true that the movie runs out of steam a bit along the way and overstays its welcome by about a half hour or so, but given its broad canvas, ""Knocked Up"" feels more expansive, comprehensive and fully baked than your average cookie-cutter romantic comedy.  It's a great deal more fun as well.",1180742400,13,4730,4.888610763454318
2912799,4,B000TZJBP6,"Probably because there is something fundamentally poignant about watching people you deem hopeless stumbling toward responsibility, this movie reminds me of the old Natalie Wood/Steve McQueen dramedy, 1963's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-With-the-Proper-Stranger/dp/6301216113/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love With the Proper Stranger</a>, about a Macy's salesgirl who gets impregnated by a ne'er-do-well jazz musician during a one-night stand and then tracks what happens afterward.

In both comedies, he manages an amazing balancing act between a raunchy, post-frat hilarity and a shrewdly observed social commentary. Yet, there is no discernible fluctuation in the humor or the genuinely good spirit the films generate. Blessedly free of exhausting crescendo moments, the dialogue has a nice ramshackle feel and so do the characters. You really feel you want to know what happens to them after the film ends.

The story looks at the outset like your standard Hollywood opposites-attract rom-com as it centers on the burgeoning relationship between Ben Stone, the perfectly named definition of a slacker, and Alison Scott, the beautiful entertainment reporter. They meet at a trendy LA bar where she is celebrating her promotion to on-air personality. Ben buys her a beer, and she is impressed enough by his unexpected chivalry to keep him company. One thing leads to another, and you can guess the rest. But what you can't guess so easily is how these characters respond to the situation and to each other. There is also a surrounding gallery of characters offering their own opinions about what is developing, in particular, Alison's acerbic older sister Debbie, who is facing a crisis of her own as the control-freak wife of passively dissatisfied husband Pete. Their story intertwines nicely with the main plotline to the point where each makes the other more resonant.

As Alison, she shows herself to be the rare actress who can be drop-dead gorgeous, smartly aware and genuinely non-judgmental. Apatow's wife Leslie Mann, who memorably demanded French toast while driving drunkenly through LA in Virgin, is terrific as Debbie, an often-irritating mass of neuroses whom you somehow like despite herself. She has a great self-revelatory scene with a bouncer outside the same bar we see at the beginning. Paul Rudd plays Pete in his deceptively casual manner with a standout scene stoned in a Vegas hotel room.

Harold Ramis has a nice small scene as Ben's proud dad, while Ben's friends are an assortment of slacker-types played out like a well-tuned improv troupe. My one complaint about the film is just some of the sluggish pacing toward the last third of the film, the same problem I had with Virgin. A running time of 129 minutes seems a bit long for the story being told here, though the birthing scene is hilariously executed, in particular, a scene-stealing bit by Ken Jeong as the passive-aggressive gynecologist called on to deliver the baby at the last minute. One other minor irritant is the deliberate reference to Virgin in some of the dialogue between Ben and Pete. Regardless, this is one smart, heartfelt character-driven farce that far exceeded my expectations.",1180742400,4,4349,6.033980582524272
2912800,5,B000TZJBP6,"Knocked Up was probably the best written and acted comedy I have seen in years. The humor was quick and fresh, but there was also some serious drama which created a great balance to the film. Katherine Heigl was really the standout for me in terms of acting, but Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd, and Leslie Mann delivered most of the laughs.

This is not a movie for the younger folks, but it is one of the few comedies you can use the words emotional and gross when describing it.",1180742400,9,471,4.292134831460674
2912801,5,B000TZJBP6,"Allison Scott (Katherine Hiegl) is part of the E! Television Network's round table of gossip columnists. Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) is the head of an X-rated website that him and his buddies (Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, Jason Segel, Martin Starr) where viewers can see famous actresses in the buff. The two meet at a night club where they down alcoholic beverages, which culminates in a one night stand. However, Ben forgot to use protection and has just got Allison knocked up, thus throwing a monkey wrench in her career. Eventually, the two agree to work it out for the sake of their newborn carriage, but they may have some trouble after they get a bit of experience from Allison's sister (Leslie Mann) and her husband (Paul Rudd).

I would like to meet anyone who wasn't in love with director Judd Apatow's 2005 smash ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"". Filled with the most raucous humor sans farcical situations, and a breakout performance from Steve Carrell, it proved that R-rated comedies were coming back full force, and Apatow became king of the world. It would be hard to follow up something of that success. But in a time when well-meaning actors/actresses like Lindsay Lohan and Larry the Cable Guy are slumming in rancid films that demean their talents (""Georgia Rule"", ""Delta Farce""), put any doubts to rest. ""Knocked Up"" will slap you silly and put a smile on your face.

Besides, what other film this summer has Ryan Seacrest going off about E! Network's star-****ing mentalities?

""Knocked Up"", pretty much like Virgin, definitely goes for laughs, and even if it does have the traits of ""touching moments"" and ""characters you really care about, Apatow never sacrifices tone, nor does he get too heavy (a round of applause for not throwing in spousal abuse or death scenes, that would've playing to the rafters instead of tickling the audience's imaginations and funny bones). He throws in a game cast (featuring some returning players from ""Virgin"", ""Saturday Night Live""'s Kristin Wiig and Bill Hader as E! Network crew members, legendary comedy director Harold Ramis as Ben's swinging father, Apatow children Iris and Maude as the Pete and Debbie's offspring), a smart script that never leans on stereotypes (the gay crowd gets another tongue lashing with hilarious results) or awful slapstick scenarios, and plenty of ad-libbing (cast members do impersonations of Robert De Niro and Larry Flint, the latter of which scores the biggest laughs courtesy of Jonah Hill) to make an effective piece of comic joy.

Of course, Apatow leans on a new subject for the satire. ""Virgin"" took aim on electronics and video games. For ""Knocked Up"", the E! Network, home of star ****ers (those who can't get enough of Brangelina, Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears, and TomKat), gets the treatment. While not EVERYONE from the network pops up, Apatow brings in a couple of guests into the mix (James Franco of ""Spider-Man"" fame gets a noteworthy scene - you rarely ever see a sentence with ""James Franco"" and ""noteworthy scene"" put together) and, as I said, Seacrest himself adds a satirical line that gossip-loving geeks with tender ears out there might not want to listen to. But for me, it was worth the matinee ticket.

Aside from that, the raunch factor is still high. I'm talking about near-frontal nudity, lap dancers in Vegas, jokes about Martin's new beard, Jonah's panic attacks about pubic hair and dead people at the hospital, Jason's warnings about Jay ""rearing"" his child (you don't have to get the joke to know that it's hysterical), the Scott family discussing how babies are born, and the explicit birth. And the pot jokes... Pete and Ben's little mushroom binder culminates in one of the funniest scenes courtesy of Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd being as over-the-top in tears as possible. I couldn't agree more.

I will say this, and get it out of the way: I do not understand the hype that is ""Grey's Anatomy""! With quirky terms like ""McSteamy"" or ""McDreamy"", and stupid soap opera to go about, who in their right mind would love this overrated crap? No wonder potentially good shows like ""Andy Barker, P.I."" and ""Kitchen Confidential"" (yes, I said it!) are put to sleep. Still, not whatsoever did that have an affect on embracing a solid performance by star Katherine Hiegl. She is no comedienne whatsoever, but by playing the straight role, she is able to stack up well against the comedy troupe with some memorable scenes, especially when sided against someone as fiercely hilarious as Mrs. Apatow herself, Leslie Mann (who has yet to disappoint me). As far as I'm concerned, this ""GA"" vet will be one to follow.

Seth Rogen fares well too. Whether it's sharing time with his porno site staffers (no red herring in that troupe), relatives, Allison's family members (his scenes with Paul Rudd are the best), or Allison herself, Rogen makes some great, and relevant (especially in the third act), decisions. And I dare any birth doctor out their to screw HIM over. Rogen's still playing Cal from ""Virgin"", only in the lead role, and I hope it ain't his last. I predict a hosting job come the season premiere for ""Saturday Night Live"".

""Knocked Up"" is also a comedy that is long, much like these high-concept films of this genre (""The Holiday""). It's not a bad thing, though, as Apatow (the only screenwriter) puts all his thought on his characters and the situations they must face. I still won't watch ""Grey's Anatomy"", but heavens, here's to a bright future for Hiegl's blooming acting career.",1180742400,,5511,4.892933618843683
