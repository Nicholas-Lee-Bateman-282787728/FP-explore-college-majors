4763337,5,B005LAII1W,"I have loved Kevin James ever since the Queen of Kings sitcom, even though it was really controversial due to its excesses of foul language, sex and violence. Even though I thought that I Now Pronounce you Larry and Milton was not as funny as James could be, I still decided to take a few friends of mine from my Alcoholics Anonymous classes to go see Here Comes the Boom, and, boy, did we ever leave not disappointed at all! You could say that this was the most fun we have ever had totally sober.

The story of this film is pretty basic so that even the densest audience members understand the plot; this is no surprise since it is a Kevin James movie after all. James plays Scott Voss, who is a 50-something home ec teacher who desirously wants to become a WWE superstar after he learns that the funding for his middle school's sex education class (bananas and all) will be cut without any mercy. Now, while some would argue that that would be good because kids will likely have less sex due to no sex education classes, Voss is not happy at all since he thinks that the sex education program should not be cut because he thinks that kids should be shown how to meticulously and correctly place a c/o/n/do/m on a Chiquita banana. All he needs is $69,000.

He then goes to the WWE's developmental territory to audition to become a WWE superstar, and he is promptly offered some steroids by Vince McMahon (doesn't he look great for 85?). Hilarious, comedic laughs ensue! After dropping some pounds and bulking up by drinking lots of protein shakes, Voss finally gets accepted into the WWE, but only as a low-card jobber, losing to the likes of Kofi Kingston, Epico and Primo and Barry Horowitz. The climax of the film occurs when Voss has to fill in for an injured John Cena at Wrestlemania X/X/X. Though Vince McMahon wants him to lose to a surprisingly returning Stone Cold Steve Austin (who by now wears several leg braces and has put on a lot of weight around his love handles), Voss rejects this proposition. As a result, he goes on to Wrestlemania X/X/X and exposes to the world just how fa/k/e ""professional"" wrasslin' really is in a pre-match promo. Everyone gets really shocked and angry at Vince McMahon that the world of wrasslin' is really f/a/k/e because they had no idea at all. Soon thereafter, WWE goes bankrupt, and all that Vince McMahon has left is his sports yacht called the S/e/x/y B/e/y/o/t/ch.

Deflated and still out of the $69,000 he requires to save his middle school's sex ed program--by the way, Voss' middle school is called Bill Clinton Middle School--Voss watches as the sex ed program is canned. Realizing that this is a sure sign that most Americans really do not want sex ed taught in schools and instead want parents to teach their kids about sex, Voss undergoes a transformative change. He becomes a televangelist who works for Pat Robertson's TV network. Even his illegal alien maid, played by Selma Hayak, follows him to his new gig.

I thought the way the movie wrapped up was brilliantly touching and funny at the same time. It was not predictable or derivative in any way, but, rather, very original and of a very high caliber of entertainment, almost as good as Suburban Commando and Mr. Nanny. I will be the first in line to buy this on VHS when it comes out!",1349913600,2,3304,4.566610455311973
4763338,5,B005LAII1W,"Rating: 10/10.

My wife and I really enjoyed this movie!  It's a must-see if you've been waiting for a quality family movie and provides a full-spectrum of Friday night entertainment.  Even though it won't win any Academy Awards it's my favorite movie of 2012--it just made me feel good.

Good Points:
- Perfect casting; all the characters were very believable and enjoyable to watch.  I really liked Henry Winkler's performance.
- Genuinely funny; many laugh-out-loud moments.
- Clean, positive message. Touching at times.
- Well-written screenplay; not many original ideas but it really didn't matter--it was satisfying.
- High production values; it was so well made that I was thoroughly engrossed from beginning to end and it never lagged.
- Salma Hayek  :)  Hey, I'm a guy.  Eye candy?  Yes, but she also added a lot of substance.

Bad Points:
- Nothing, really.  It was slightly corny but I didn't care.
- Violent and bloody fighting scenes--caution for children under 8 years old.
- The title of the movie is odd.",1349913600,4,1020,4.906432748538012

4763427,3,B005LAII1W,"I'm a fan of mixed martial arts, and I had seen this movie as a result of Mayhem Miller's ""Lucky Patrick"" interview on Ariel Helwani.  Unfortunately, the version of Lucky Patrick that showed up on the MMA Hour seems to be a character that was created after the filming of this movie, just for the interview. He appears in the film, but isn't really a character.

The film itself has a good plot, a biology teacher turning to MMA to support his school. Kevin James did a great job, and the fights are exciting.  A good movie overall, but it wasn't one of my favirites. The love plot is cheesy, and the principle of the school is a jerk.",1518134400,,635,4.319327731092437

4763431,5,B005LAII1W,"I watched this myself, then with my son, then with family for the holidays. It is a unique and warm story, and has some hilarious moments and fantastic character actors. Safe for watching with kids, in my opinion, because there's no terrible language, no inappropriate situations, other than violence. However, the violence is not glamorized, but contained in the humorous storyline as a line of work the main character chooses in order to make fast money.

Kevin's real life brother offered up some of the funnier moments dealing with domestic realities. Every character in this film made me laugh until it hurt. This film is a sure crowd pleaser as it has the Asians, Hispanics and the white crowd both old and young covered quite well. Most of the comedy is from the older actors in this film so I think the older crowd will appreciate this film as much as teens will. At times you know you are watching a comedy. At other points you know there is good heart touching drama added in with a comedic touch. And then when the fighting kicks in you feel like you are watching a real fight. If you have a heart for music studies you will cheer these characters on! If you enjoy the UFC/MMA fighting then you'll have a blast watching Kevin James dive into this world and get/give a good whooping! A lot of the real players/announcers/refs from UFC are in this film adding to the feel of a real UFC match. It's a smart film in it's comedic moments. On the other hand, as contrived and predictable as many elements in this story are, you will still find yourself cheering the players on and maybe even feel your eyes water due to feelings from either end of the emotional spectrum. I had given up on comedy films in recent years as most of them our just way too raunchy. But the PG rating on this film...I applaud all those behind this production.

4764116,5,B005LAII1W,"OK, I had to look away during the fight scenes, but I was surprised to find how much I (and my family) enjoyed this movie. As a viewer, you definitely have to employ the old ""willing suspension of disbelief,"" but once you do, this movie is a lot of fun. A jaded teacher rediscovers his passion for teaching after he agrees to help raise money for his school's music program -- and save a teacher's job -- by taking up mixed martial arts. It's funny and feel-good all at the same time.

One aspect of the movie that we particularly enjoyed were the references to faith and prayer. They were low-key but present, inserted as just a normal part of the MMA scene. In fact, Kevin James has a strong Catholic faith and has said in interviews that talk of God and faith is part and parcel of the guys involved in MMA. Kudos to any filmmaker who is willing to depict faith as a normal and laudable thing, not an aberrant or laughable delusion.

My one wish is that someone would have taught Henry Winkler how to conduct! His scenes as the music teacher conducting the student orchestra are painful to watch!",1465776000,,1099,4.4088669950738915

Several stars crop up in this (Joe Rogan, Henry Winkler), which is a nice wink to adults while still being kid-appropriate. It's one of those movies that keeps a balance--you don't feel like you're stuck in a kiddie movie as an adult, but it doesn't talk over kids' heads, either.

Lots of positive takeaways here, without it feeling lecture-y. Surprisingly conventional and family friendly, which maybe explains why it didn't get the box office attention it deserves. A good pick for a family movie night.",1439942400,,612,5.12

It's a funny (hilarious, actually), feel good movie that has good acting and an amusing story. Having seen The Zookeeper and Paul Blart, we actually felt this was the best of the three, and we plan on keeping it for future viewings.

I won't say much about the storyline (you can read all about that in a million other places), but I will say this has a somewhat unconventional tie-in between MMA and teaching at a high school... I honestly had heard nothing about this until this last week, and it was the fact it was Kevin James and rated PG that made us want to watch it.

Henry Winkler's character makes you feel for him and admire him simultaneously.  It's essentially an redemption story regarding Kevin James' character, and he plays the part well.  Bas Rutten plays well as James' trainer and definitely adds to the fun.  Nothing groundbreaking in the plot, and some might find certain bits trite, but the characters and the story are appropriate for a broad spectrum of ages.

4766288,3,B005LAII1W,"Kevin James is quite charming and affective in what would otherwise be a sub-par comedy.  James plays a high school teacher that has seen his enthusiasm for the challenges of the daily struggle diminish into nothingness.  Not since Bad Teacher where Cameron Diaz played a teacher not just bad but despicable has Hollywood put up such a sad creature in a teaching role.  He no longer gives a hoot about teaching, about his students or even about himself.  He is so discouraged and lackadaisical that he cannot even mount a credible romantic assault on his co-worker, Selma Hayak.
 In a wonderful portrayal of a music teacher Henry Winkler in a backwards kind of way provides the poor slubs salvation.  With the music department, and Winklers job, about to disappear due to a budget cut, Kevin James tries to save the day by competing in mixed martial arts prize fights.  The take from losing the fights he plans to donate to saving the kids music (He is out of shape, old and inexperienced.  He has no dream of winning.)  In the process of getting his brains beat out every week end, he saves not just the music department but himself in the bargain.
 Strong performances by Winkler and James make the movie.  Hayak, typically in Hollywood films, is given little to do but be pretty and fend off her fellow teachers half hearted advances.  Too bad, the Mexican born beauty showed as recently as this year in Savages that she is capable of very good acting, if offered.  Of course even at 46 years of age she still has the screen presence and beauty to be a big Tinsel Town star.
 Allen Loeb(this years Rock of Ages) and Kevin James wrote this one and James also is among the producers.  The direction by Frank Coraci provided more laughs than the writers.  He has a very rough martial arts instructor filling out his time card by teaching yoga and Zumba exercise dancing.  And some find the repeated pummeling of star Kevin James amusing.
 It is hard to make a decent comedy but the efforts of Kevin James and Henry Winkler lift this movie to a watchable three saw blades.  It is rated PG for some pretty horrifying punches, kicks body slams and what not in the fighting scenes.  The teacher really does earn his redemption.  It runs a fast and pleasant one hour and 45 minutes.  Both director Frank Coraci (Click, Waterboy, The Wedding Singer) and star Kevin James are staples with Adam Sandlers production company, Happy Madison studios.  With a budget of $42 million and receipts of only $30 million we will see how happy the producers end up when all the tallies are in.",1414713600,,2573,4.618942731277533

I was delighted to see scenes depicting prayer and patriotism. These things are not at the core of the movie, but they play into the concept of personal fortitude and a winning attitude. The main theme is wrapped around standing up for and doing for others.

4766873,5,B005LAII1W,"According to my neighbor (who's pretty resourceful when it comes to movies), HERE COMES THE BOOM is one of the top ten films of all time!  Now I, on the other hand, don't know much about flicks per say (I prefer to call them ""Talkies""), but I know a perfect movie when I see one and THIS is a perfect movie!  I know there's high stipulation that comes with a comment like this, but my proof is in the figgie pudding; I laughed not once, but twice while watching this movie... and even smiled on multiple occasions!  The jokes here are so good it'll make you stare up into the heavens and scream WHY GOD WHY?!

The storyline setup is a blast of comedic irreverence.  Former college wrestler Scooter Floss (played here to a T by legendary chunkster Adam Sandlot) is a 42-year-old depressed high school teacher. When talks of a government sequestration threatens to cancel his school programs and lay him off, Scooter begins to train as a mixed martial arts fighter in hopes to sneak up on unsuspecting politicians and rear naked choke them into changing their minds.  Everyone thinks Scooter is crazy - most of all the school nurse, Bella (played by the always wonderful Roosy Perez) - but in his quest, Scooter gains something he never expected as a wanted felon -  humility, dignity, and the courage to stand up for himself and his colleagues.  The final bout, especially, is full of hilarious ups and downs.  I love how they flip the whole genre upside down and have Scooter chicken-out just before the final fight that would earn his school enough money to stay in business, and instead tricks Bella to step in and fight for him.  Seeing her get rick-rolled during the end credits makes this movie definitely worth the money!

There are just too many killer lines in this film to mention, but one of my favorites would be Bella trying to pronounce words with more than one consonant.  I laughed myself into tears every time her character struggled to produce coherent words from her lips.  Nearly all of Scooter's and Bella's dialogue is pure gold, but the secret to that success is also due to their outstanding chemistry together.  I've always been a (silent) fan of Sandlot, but he's absolutely hilarious here.  I mean, look at all the faces this dudit makes, they're priceless!  I probably paused and rewatched every scene he's in because he is so fricken hysterical!  At first glance I couldn't even tell that it was Sandlot in the lead role and was convinced that the actor had to be one of the producers special needs younger brother or something because the faces he makes are stupid funny and they had me rolling on the ground in tears.

Obviously, at its core, it has one of those movie `plots', but once it starts, you'll hardly even notice it's there. Make no mistake, you know all too well how this story ends, but that's OK, not only is it a happy ending, it's totally believable and you WANT to see Scooter fail miserably by getting molly-whopped... I mean, this IS a Sandlot movie after all.  However, through all the beatings he takes in this movie (not enough in my opinion); through all many montage scenes where he takes repeated kicks and punches to his bean sack (again, not enough in my opinion), I still found time to smile briefly, something that I totally didn't expect at all!

HERE COMES THE BOOM has a little bit of everything (romance, laughs, hand-to-hand combat, projectile vomiting), and is presented in such a way that it can and will please everyone.  Not an easy feat to accomplish.  I really appreciate flicks like this, because it's so rare for them to nail everything just right.  I especially dug the overall theme of the movie, which had a ""Raging Bull"" vibe to it.  The only problem I did have is with that Pablo guy.  He was a tad weak and underused, but thankfully he isn't in this movie.  Bottom line, this flick is brilliant, one of the few films in which I wouldn't change a thing; it represents the comedy genre at its very finest.  Boom!",1392422400,,3988,4.588152327221438

But, this was a heart-warming movie, well-paced, just the right blend of comedy, underdog, and positive social messages.  All of the main characters were very likeable, and the relationship between Kevin James and Henry Winklers' characters really made you root for a positive outcome in their circumstance.  The Bas Rutten character, Kevin James' MMA fighter, also had a likeable, and often-times funny, role.

Selma Hayek plays the hard-to-get school nurse that James is attracted to.  Henry (The FONZ) Winkler plays the music teacher.  Joe Rogan makes an appearance.  The film is really hilarious.  If you've seen other James movies and liked them (MALL COP, ZOOKEEPER), then you will like this.  It's really almost a family film with some tough fighting sequences.  One difference here, compared to his other roles... is that James is not the usual loser at the beginning.  He's a jaded teacher who has lost his way.  The desire to help puts him on a journey that ultimately changes him and reminds him of what he was like when he first became a teacher;  ENGAGED.

Sometimes the things we can measure don't count, and the things that count, we can't measure -- Albert Einstein said something like that, and he knew about numbers.

When the school has to make some cuts and decides to cut the music department, he decides to do something about it. Through his attempts to earn money for the music program, he learns more about himself and starts believing in his role as a teacher again.

This movie really was done in the spirit of many of the early Adam Sandler flicks (many of which I still thoroughly enjoy to this day), but I like how they put in a very serious twist, a worthy goal to achieve. I wouldn't have believed Kevin James would be the guy to play the role of an athlete on any level, but he pulled it off and did a great job.

It really is funny, and so sweet. It had me laughing, and teared up in all the right moments. The cast is great, the story is solid, and the fight scenes were done very well -- as a fan of MMA, I wasn't disappointed. Henry Winkler is genius in this, and Kevin James probably does his best work to date. I cannot even put it into words how much I loved this movie.

We use a clearplay dvd player to watch most movies so that language, nudity, sexuality, violence is filtered out. This movie didn't need a filter. The violence is the cage fighting that is central to the plot of the movie and isn't bad. It's a great story of how one person can make a difference and inspire others to step forward as well.

What are people looking for in a movie? I think the ""professional"" critics were harsh acting like the plot was unintelligent and unrealistic. Seriously, how many movies have story lines that include unintelligent and unrealistic events?

Kevin James can really deliver the humor and as for us......we laughed at quite a bit of stuff in the movie. We teared up almost at the ""feel good"" parts too, but I believe that is the reaction the movie hoped to produce.

As for the fellow who said it didn't even make him smile......YOU MUST BE A MISERABLE SOUR PUSS!",1370649600,,651,4.692982456140351

4767764,3,B005LAII1W,"Not bad.  Definitely one of the better Kevin James movies I have seen since King of Queens went off the air but that's not necessarily saying a lot.

It's obviously another quirky-'main character doesn't care until it gets real and then he steps up and everything comes together'-type of movie; but Bas Rutten kills it as his trainer (for not being an actor) and they do a really good job of making you want to help Henry Winkler because he's such a goodhearted guy.

A couple scenes seemed pushed though, and gimmicky, but you have to almost expect those from this type of movie (that doesn't justify them though).  That and these fight scenes where a guy will have his face pummeled for 20 seconds straight and be mostly okay afterwards completely baffles me.

Salma Hayek, although mostly wallpaper in this movie, is as hot as ever and does help to give dimension to the main character/plot.  Bas Rutten steals this movie though.  Being a big MMA fan, or at least at one time I was, this was nice to see, as I grew up watching him.

In the past we have only seen an over weight comedian getting sloppy laughs off the humor of being fast and stupid.  In this movie he is lean and mean fighting, literally, for his students.

4768058,4,B005LAII1W,"I love Kevin James.  His movies don't always pan out like I want them to, thanks to his friendship with Adam Sandler, but for the most part he tends to elevate everything he touches.  The idea of him starring in a family friendly `Warrior' type film just seemed like too much fun to pass on.  For the most part, this film delivers in a big way, with smart laughs and a real heart at its center.

`Here Comes the Boom' is the latest in that long line of inspirational `teacher' stories, except this one is clearly a comedy going for less assertive schmaltz (or more comedic schmaltz) and is laced with the sudden interest in that crazy world of UFC fighting.  In the film, James plays Scott, a disillusioned biology teacher who has become rather lazy thanks to the school's overall lack of enthusiasm about teaching.  When budget cuts threaten to cost the music teacher his job, Scott steps up to the plate to try and raise the HUGE sum of money needed to keep the man employed.  When teaching night school isn't cutting it, he turns to the world of mixed martial arts and becomes the school's hero as he fights his way to the top, quite literally.

James is a very likable guy.  Even in horrible movies like `Zookeeper' and `Chuck and Larry' he's a lovable presence.  You can't help but want to watch him.  Here, he takes that everyman routine to another level and really nails both sides of the spectrum.  When the film starts he's an outspoken oaf who is late to his job, obviously uninspired and kind of apathetic.  By the film's end his heart is on his sleeve and all the goodness that was below the surface comes out in spades.  The film's handling of that golden center is really well done to.  Yes, I was teary eyed by the time it was all over.  It is saccharine and yet not in that overtly sentimental kind of way.

But this brings me to a major concern I have with this movie; it is REALLY VIOLENT.  For a PG rated film, I expected the violence and fighting to be in a more slapstick nature, and so I allowed my daughter to watch it.  Sure, the scenes are set up to be funny, but they are very aggressive.  I was shocked it was PG, for the violence is no less extreme than seen in films like `Warrior'.  I have a problem with this because while the film itself teaches a positive message, I don't really think kids need to see grown men beating each other to a pulp.

That said, for the adults this one works.  The humor is nicely developed for a film produced by Adam Sandler (who just isn't funny anymore).  Salma Hayek is not a good actress, but she kind of makes a sweet love interest here.  Overall, I really liked this one.",1366588800,,2638,4.33469387755102

It's an improvement. It has a lot of funny scenes that don't feel like they're ""trying too hard"", Kevin James doesn't overdo his role, and the jokes are somewhat unique. The story is extremely predictable though, especially when you get toward the end. I think we ALL know what happens in the final fight long before it starts to move that direction. It does actually try a little too hard to be touching by throwing a bunch of kids' dreams into the story, but the comedy allows me to forgive it of that.",1366329600,,709,4.672

The plot was lame with big holes and unrealistic characters and happenings, the acting mediocre at best. Sorry but it jusy wasn't funny no matter how much I tried to like it.

4768498,4,B005LAII1W,"Kevin James deliver again.  This was a great movie that we really, really liked.  The only problem I had was that it served as an unfortunate ""appetizer"" for viewers into 'the world of MMA' (mixed martial arts, cage matches, ultimate fighting, etc.)  That activity is a major element in the story line, but not what the movie is about - it merely provides a vehicle through which the ""real story"" plays out.  (Be careful if you are strongly against you or your kids getting an introduction to that whole element - or be ready to process the exposure appropriately afterward)  This would have been 5+ stars if any other setting was used to accomplish the necessary story element.

The actors were good, nice to see Henry Winkler.  Script needed some work but I did like that they had the main character trying to earn money by losing, basically, just getting in the ring earned him money, which I thought was a believable story approach.  What I didn't find believable was a teacher caring nothing for his students or himself (as the character was introduced into the story), suddenly standing up and caring for the Henry Winkler character; transition wasn't supported in the story.

I am a tough critic, and I saw the trailer and thought it was a total turd when it flashed on tv. Trailers can be deceiving. This was a good movie. As a self admitted stand up comedy junkie I like to think my sense of humor is tickled by a little more than cheap fart jokes and groin kicks, and that's what I expected with this. Boy was I surprised. It's an entertaining little movie, has a good set up, original plot, and a charming lead character (if you don't mind Kevin James, who can be a little annoying sometimes I admit). Feel good is how I would describe it. There are other reviews that will get into more detail on plot points, but I came into this blind and I still enjoyed it. Will you die from laughter? Not really. It's funny enough to make me laugh though, and as a comedy, it's what you'd expect (but don't always receive). See it. Watch it with your 10-18 y.o.

4768640,5,B005LAII1W,"Honestly, I was expecting this to be pretty bad.  We were really surprised and very entertained.

While it's a silly story, it is a nice peek into the camaraderie found within MMA and martial arts.  The acting is good and the characters are likable.  Bas Rutten almost steals the show as Niko a retired fighter/coach/aerobics/spin/yoga instructor who's trying to earn his USA citizenship while leading Scott (Kevin James) through an attempt to survive some MMA fights, a plot he hatched as he was shaken from a dull complacency in his high school teaching career when he decides to  to earn some fight money to help save the high school music program.  The supporting actors and cameo appearances are all really well done.

We've watched this movie a half dozen times and it's still a favorite for our family.  Each time we watch it this movie us cheering and feeling good about people.

It's surprisingly family friendly and other than the word ""ass"" once or twice the language is clean and there's no sexual or overly raunchy humor.

It still had the violence, but for pre-teens and teenagers this wouldn't be too much at all.

4768785,2,B005LAII1W,"I wanted to like this movie as the reviews said that it was about a teacher who saves a music program in a school by becoming a fighter.  The opening scenes really confirmed my opinion about the rest of the movie.  The character played by Kevin James of King of Queens fame is a biology teacher who is a slacker.  He shows up late for his class and proceeds to read the newspaper in front of the kids and as we must concur, he is ""burned out"", hasn't had a vacation in awhile so he takes it out on the students.  He also teaches a citizenship class at night and spends most of it insulting the immigrants who are trying to learn about how the US works.  He suddenly gets inspired to become a ""good guy"" when his buddy, the music teacher played by Henry Winkler is about to lose his job because of budget cuts.  We've all heard that budget story before in the schools!  Yawn!  Aside from Kevin James the cast was stellar, like Henry Winkler and Salma Hayek.  Their scripts were not.  There are so many good films out there about teachers who made a difference that this movie just pales in comparison.  Most of the movies are based on true stories like Music From The Heart, Knights Of The South Bronx, Take The Lead, Mr. Holland's Opus, and many more. This story was just so unbelievable, and in my opinion, didn't even have any funny moments.  Unless one likes to witness people having the stuffing beaten out of them for money then maybe some people will like this movie.  It didn't do anything for me!",1364688000,,1504,4.347670250896058

4768860,4,B005LAII1W,"From Frank Coraci, the director of ""The Waterboy"", ""The Wedding Singer"" and ""Click"" comes the comedy ""Here Comes the Boom"".

Written by actor Kevin James (""The King of Queens"", ""Hitch"", ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop""), Allan Loeb (""Just Go With It"", ""21, ""The Switch"") and Rock Reuben (""Zookeeper"", ""The King of Queens""), ""Here Comes the Boom!"" is a film inspired by Kevin James' interest in Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) and watching the UFC, which he and fellow comedian Joe Rogan would watch years ago.

Wanting to create a comedy that ties in with the UFC, James brought in his friends, Joe Rogan (""The Fear Factor"", ""NewsRadio""), former UFC Heavyweight Champion and ""Inside MMA"" host, Sebastian ""Bas"" Rutten and professional Muay Thai kickboxer and trainer Mark DellaGrotte (""The Ultimate Fighter 4) and also a bunch of professional fighters to the film.

But alongside James, he brought in talent with Salma Hayek (""Frida"", ""Desperado"", ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico""), Henry Winkler (""Happy Days"", ""The Waterboy"", ""Night Shift"", ""Click""), Greg Germann (""Ally McBeal"", ""Bolt"", ""Sweet November""), Charice (""Glee"", ""Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakuel"") and brother Gary Valentine (""The King of Queens"", ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop"", ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry"").

VIDEO:

""Here Comes the Boom"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1 aspect ratio).  The film looks fantastic on Blu-ray as close-ups show amazing detail of the characters faces.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Here Comes the Boom"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and French, Spanish and Thai 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The film is primarily dialogue driven with plenty of music, so front and center-channel driven.  Good use of surrounds for crowd ambiance, especially during Scott Voss' entry to the ring.  Good use of surrounds during the more action intense sequences but for the most part, lossless audio is very good!

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Chinese (Cantonese and Mandarin Traditional), Korean and Thai.

JUDGMENT CALL:

After the disappointing ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop"", I have to admit that I was not sure if I wanted to see ""Here Comes the Boom"", that is until I reminded myself of the many chances I have given Adam Sandler films and realized that actor Kevin Smith is part of the same crew of actor/comedians and you have to give them the benefit of the doubt.  But also, you have Frank Coraci as director, and so I figured that I should give the film a chance.

And after watching Smith's latest film ""Here Comes the Boom"", I have to say that I enjoyed this film a lot!

A film about an overweight man having to compete in the UFC, I'm sure is going to be a source of laughs for a lot of people but for this film, what makes it work is the fact that Kevin James is a big fan and follower of mixed martial arts (MMA) and the UFC.  He has trained not to fight but trained in MMA for his workout in the past several years and for this role, he dedicated himself to a regiment to get fit.

While we are not going to see anything drastic such as Tom Hanks ""Castaway"" of seeing a man with pounds transform to a rail thin individual, Kevin Smith is seen to go through some changes within the body and eventually see some muscle definition.

You also get a cast of unlikely ""three amigos"" joining in on the film with ""Happy Days"" actor Henry Winkler being put together with the loud and talkative former UFC heavyweight champion fighter Bas Rutten and the famous Boston Muay Thai trainer Mark DellaGrotte.  You really don't know what to expect when you have these three as part of Team Scott Voss and suffice to say, hilarity ensues from the moment this film starts to the way it ends.

Add in the beautiful Salma Hayek and the singer with the beautiful voice, Charice and you have an entertaining action/comedy film.

While not exactly a Rocky-style of film, as a viewer, whether or not you enjoy MMA or not, you sympathize with the character of Scott Voss, the teacher and underdog who is doing all he can to rescue the music program at his school and his friend, Marty's job.  But it's that friendship that is developed in the storyline that ultimately becomes entertaining.

Henry Winkler as Marty, the timid musician who is softspoken but tries to help Scott in unusual ways, Niko who is trying to become a US citizen but also a bit jealous that Scott is getting a chance to fight in the UFC and his career ended after a significant injury and Mark DellaGrotte who puts Scott through a test by sicking three of his best fighters to see if Scott deserves to be trained.

The fight choreography is fantastic and you actually learn through the special features that some of these fighters that had to fight against Scott are still competing in the UFC and it's not easy to train a fighter to pull their punches, because it works against their training.  So, actor Kevin James took a pounding in several scenes and he also dished it back as well against the fighters in the film.

But for the most part, everything comes together and I have to say that it's Kevin James best film yet!  And it helps when the actor is enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the subject, and in this case, mixed martial arts.

As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality and lossless audio is fantastic.  There are are good amount of special features included and for the most part, a solid Blu-ray release overall.

If you are a fan of Kevin James, may it be from television via ""The King of Queens"" or his past films, ""Here Comes the Boom"" is an exciting and hilarious film and his best one yet!  ""Here Comes the Boom"" is recommended!",1364601600,5,7095,4.717303005686434

I liked this movie; it may not break new ground in story telling or be Oscar worthy, but the characters were all very like-able and the movie had several really funny moments. Kevin James does a really good job playing a teacher who seems to have lost his passion for his job and we get to see him regain it again. His character is a likable guy and someone that you can look up to, something you don't very often see in comedies anymore. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good comedy.",1364515200,,530,4.31

I will say that this is a great family movie that doesn't blast the ""f---"" word into your psyche every 5 minutes! I, for one, am so darn tired of hearing that word in almost every movie I've seen here lately. They should make more movies like this where compassion toward your fellow neighbor is displayed in such an empathetic and triumphant way. LOVED IT!!!!",1364169600,,481,4.604651162790698

4768976,2,B005LAII1W,"Euhh, I know I'll get a lot of unhelpful reviews for giving this 2 stars, but at least I am giving an honest review. If you saw the trailer and thought this movie is about a guy who teaches, and needs to raise some money, so he risks his body to join the UFC to raise the dough, then you would be right. He wins over the love of a woman, as well as the class he teaches... there is not really anymore to say about the plot... what you thought it would be, is exactly what you get.

The acting is what you expect. If you like Kevin James, Salma Hayek & The Fonz in a a typical movie like a PG Rated Happy Madison family movie, then by all means, see it if you haven't. If that isn't something you would watch, then you probably have already decided not to see it by now anyway.

Personally I thought the comedy was something that was just present. It was there, nothing that made me burst out laughing, but you won't mistake this as a drama or anything else, there is nothing you will kick yourself for missing out on from this film. However, like all movies like this, it rams as much heart into it as it possibly can to make a typical Disney fairy-tale ending, and I dunno if it's just because I have seen a million movies where the underdog comes out on top and lives happily ever after, but I thought it was just another done-it-before, done-to-death plot that this time changes the sport to UFC.

Look I'm not saying it's a terrible movie, I watched it from start to finish and wasn't yawning away and wanting to turn it off... but once it was over, I have no ambition to see it ever again. It is was it is, and personally I don't think it is anything special, nor something I would want to own my very own copy of.

Overall: Worthy of an overnight rental, but to purchase it? I can't see the point in watching it over and over again.",1364169600,2,1838,4.140056022408964

 It's like Back to School meets Dodgeball meets The Waterboy except they just sprayed easy cheese all over it. Nothing funny or original at all in this whole movie. It's filled with ridiculous unauthentic lines and I can't believe Kevin James didn't stop at some point and be like ""is this seriously my line?"" And honestly, I like crap, I can even stand a Rob Schneider movie, but this was just a cliche of multiple ""feel good"" comedies with no originality (ok except I GUESS the MMA fighter crap, but they didn't even do anything unique with it).

If you have any taste in real comedy just run from this movie. If you like cheesy predictable ""I clearly only did this for the paycheck"" movies... by all means enjoy.",1364083200,3,778,4.58273381294964

There are a few slow parts but for the most part, Kevin James and Henry Winkler, playing the straight man, is a funny duo throughout the whole movie.

4769468,5,B005LAII1W,"Kevin James' character is probably the last person we would think would save the day. He is a slacker teacher who is there to get a paycheck. He even teaches a citizenship class to pull in a few extra bucks. In a tight economy, the school is strapped as to what programs to cut - all of the programs are worthy, but the money just isn't there to keep everything. As it typical, the music program is the first slated to go.  After seeing what a marvelous impact Henry Winkler's character, the band teacher, is having on his orchestra students, our hero becomes inspired. Thinking that the school board needs to get its priorities straight, our hero begins a campaign to save the band teacher's job and the Orchestra. He begins a fund raiser by becoming a boxer.  With some parallels to Rocky, there is enough Kevin James in this movie to make parts of it ""laugh outloud hysterical""!  A fiesty nurse, who has turned our hero down for a date twenty times, provides our character with motivation to keep taking the punches and inspire a whole student body.

4769584,4,B005LAII1W,"I really like this movie. I expected it to be another slap-stick movie since Kevin James is in it with all the other comedians, but it turned out to be better than just your average stupid comedy.

The humor is supposed to be second in this movie. That's why there not much of. And truth be told, if Kevin James and the rest wasn't in the movie, they could had just made a standard UFC/MMA movie like The Warrior 2001.

But, this movie is a little different. The focus is on the hard determination and dedication of what one man can do for a failing and bankrupt school. Most of the time, you're going to see fighting. A lots of it! And since Kevin is in it, they will make the movie somewhat humorous, but again, it's not supposed to be a slap-stick movie. That's not the main focus for this movie.

I love seeing Kevin progress from a out of shape retired wrestler from way back to to learning how to fight in MMA fights. Then, to finish it off on a good note, he actually won his debut fight in the UFC!

4769824,4,B005LAII1W,"I love a feel good movie that's supposed to be based on a real life story. The only problem is when I hear that I want to know more about the actual story so that I can find out just how much is real and how much is fiction. You won't get that information here but you will get a very entertaining film if you watch HERE COMES THE BOOM.

Kevin James stars as Scott Voss, a teacher who's seen better days and for whom work is nothing more than a job to pass time. At one time Voss was a dedicated teacher and even won teacher of the year but that was ten years earlier. That time has come and gone.

Voss is the close friend of Marty Streb (Henry Winkler), the school music teacher who never lost his desire to inspire and encourage his students. As the pair head to a staff meeting, Marty tells Voss that his wife is expecting, an amazing achievement considering his age. Problems kick in when during the meeting the staff is told that due to lack of funding several departments are going to be cut next year beginning with the music department. When Voss argues against the cuts he's told that unless they can come up with the funding, $48, 000, the program is gone.

Voss calls for a meeting of teachers to find out how they can raise the funds but the only ones to show are himself, Marty and the school nurse Bella (Selma Hayek) that he has the hots for but who turns him down with each request for a date. Bella is only interested in someone who had dedication and the desire to teach and she's missed that in Voss by ten years. Other than Bella doing a bake sale, Voss' only other option is to teach a night school course in citizenship. It doesn't add up to much but it's a start.

One night Voss watches an MMA (mixed martial arts) fight with his brother and thinks he can do that. Having been a collegiate wrestler he knows he can do at least enough to survive. When one of his students, an ex MMA fighter named Niko (real MMA star Bas Rutten) tells him how much he can earn in losing a fight, Voss decides that even if he loses 30 fights over the next year he can make enough to keep the music program running. Now to keep everyone in the dark (except Marty who is helping him) about the subject.

Voss soon learns that being in an MMA bout isn't quite as easy as he expected. But with some help from his friends he begins to get better with each fight. A problem with some bad apple sauce results in the kids at school finding out about what he's trying to do and he soon gets their support as well.

Voss' training goes into gear when he gets professional help from one if Niko's friends. Not only that but the training as well as the encouragement from the students help Voss to find his passion for teaching again. He rises not only to the challenge of the ring but to that of his students as well and with that comes the chance for romance with Bella.

Of course the usual film storyline comes into play here with Voss suddenly having the opportunity to fight in a professional UFC fight where he can earn enough money to get the program funded for the next year plus. A twist in the story kicks in the night before the match and suddenly everything that has come before finds Voss doing the right thing not for himself but for those of everyone around him that he cares for.

Yes, the story line here reads like ROCKY or other sports films of this sort where the underdog has the chance to save the day. So what? The movie moves along at a steady pace and entertains along the way. It doesn't feel like there is a moment wasted but at the same time doesn't feel rushed either. What it does do is have you rooting for the little guy from start to finish and that finish will have you on the edge of your seat until the final bell rings.

The best thing in this movie though is the performances with one small exception. Hayek does a great job but her part is far too small here. She's more window dressing and supporting role than star which is sad. The amazing acting here comes from the three male stars. Kevin James looks like he got into better shape for this film and not only does he handle the comedy scenes well he actually turns in a great performance while he's at it. For me he's always been a good actor but relied too often on comedy. Here he has a chance to shine.

Having grown up with the Fonz years ago I've witnessed Winkler do some good roles and some bad ones. This movie gives him a chance to stretch as well. Unlike James he does a good job with the dramatic part his role gives him but does even better with the comedy. Alongside Winkler in Voss' corner is Bas Rutten who does an amazing job for this being his first real major role. He offers a tender character but has some hilarious moments as well.

I guess the best thing this film has going for it is that it entertains. There are a lot of movies out there these days that don't seem to do that, ones that struggle to be funny but aren't or that try to touch your heart but don't come close. This is one movie that does both. I know it's one that will find a place on my shelf which means it will be watched more than once. While we may not know the real story this was based on everyone will have a chance to root for the little guy and to enjoy the story that's told.",1362614400,,5263,4.1753694581280785

4769990,4,B005LAII1W,"This was actually a better movie than I expected it would be. (I suppose it's easier to be good if you have low expectations to begin with, but that's beside the point.)  It was actually enjoyable, with a good number of ""warm, fuzzy moments"" that made the movie an overall good experience.

I don't do spoilers, per se, but this next part is about as close to spoilers as I get, so be warned. Kevin James' character is the typical burned-out teacher trope that we've all seen before, but he does it with enough enthusiasm that it's enjoyable. He's always trying to get the girl, and she's always rebuffing his advances, but they make it work (if you can get past the fact that there's no apparent reason why Salma Hayek would be attracted to Kevin James, both physically and mentally, in the first place). And there's the whole MMA thing; you have to be willing to believe that a 42 year old overweight teacher is going to be able to compete with well-trained athletes half his age in MMA cage fights. If you're willing to suspend your disbelief, than this movie will work for you.

The casting is good, and the action flows. The scenarios in the movie, which we've seen so many times before (remember ""Summer School"" or ""The Principal""?) are done well enough so that they don't seem too musty. And, when push comes to shove, it's supposed to be a feel-good movie, it turns out to be a pretty good feel-good movie, and I felt good at the end of the movie, so mission accomplished.",1362441600,,1480,4.4944237918215615

4770030,4,B005LAII1W,"I am a huge UFC fan, but even with that being the case I did not have very high expectations about this movie. I had heard Joe Rogan say that the movie was very good when it came out but I thought he was just following the company line. I was mistaken! This is truly a funny movie, that anyone that follows MMA will have a great time watching.

Several UFC stars make an appearance, including Chael Sonnen, Wanderlei Silva and Mayhem Miller among other fighters, Joe Rogan, Stitch, Herb Dean and the well-known coach Mark DellaGrotte. Now, don't expect this movie to show you some nice MMA action; that is not the point. It is all about finding something that matters in life and putting your mind to it. Talking about that, Kevin James, who plays Scott Voss, a high school biology teacher that has lost the fire and starts to get it back when he decides to help save the music program in the school, took some time in building himself up in terms of his physique. There is a markedly huge difference vs. his King of Queens character.

Of course as in most comedies there is some romance, and it is done in just the right amount. The story has enough of a touchy-feely too and strikes a nice balance in this sense. They do a decent job with trying to jerk a few tears from the touch UFC fan crowd.

The part I am not sure I understand is that one of the main fights is with Krzysztof Soszyinski, but instead of appearing in the movie with his real name, like the others do, he goes by Ken Dietrich. He still maintains the characteristics of the real UFC fighter, but not sure why they chose to change the name. There are also some references than only UFC fans will get, such as ""Showtime kick"", but I think that people that do not follow MMA still can have a good time with this movie.",1362441600,,1786,4.293768545994065

4770075,3,B005LAII1W,"""Here Comes The Boom"" is a very entertaining movie with Kevin James in the believable role of a former high school wrestler who turns to mixed martial arts to earn some extra money.

The script only rates two starts, but the acting and directing deserve four stars so, overall, it's a three.",1362355200,,448,4.6125

This is a very funny movie and you find yourself rooting for Kevin.  Some of it is silly, but I like a little silly.  I was worried it would be like so many other ""high school teacher breaks the rules for their kids"" movies...and although this one was a little on the formulaic side, they still had enough quality in there to make it good.

Watch it knowing what to expect - a comedy with a silly side but also a lot of good rooting-for-the-good-guy-to-(literally)-kick-the-bad-guy's-butt.  Don't watch it expecting an academy award drama and you'll like it too. :)

I rented it because my wife wanted to see it and we were flying and had time to kill.  The movie was eminently predictable; but was really enjoyable and funny despite the predictability and low expectations. How they got me to suspend disbelief about some of the improbable situations and care about the characters, I couldn't say... But it was a good, entertaining movie.  Not going to win any Oscars; but for decent entertainment on a trip it was a pleasant surprise.",1361836800,,623,4.697247706422019

They pulled it off very well with this movie.  I think it helps that Kevin is a avid fan of MMA and brought in the best talent who are legends in the sport and have a great sense of humor, like Bas who in my opinion almost stole the show.

4770712,4,B005LAII1W,"It's funny and entertaining.  Kevin James plays the perfect part of a 42 year-old biology teacher who dives into MMA fighting in order to raise money for his school, so that the music department (headed by Henry Winkler) won't be shut down.  In this day of ubiquitous profanity, gratuitous violence and sexual references, it's ALMOST a film that the whole family can see.  The rough guys of the UFC are also portrayed as down-to-earth, likeable, and they even pray before a match.  This gives the film a good vibe.  James' character also leads a kind of a resurgence in people's lives, including his brother (who would rather be a chef than a painter), the oddball music teacher (Winkler, in a great role), his trainer Niko (a charismatic and physical character) and the father of one of his students (a restaurant owner).  For such a bunch of tough guys, there's little profanity (usually centered on a guy saying he's going to kick another guy's a**).  There is the violence around UFC fighting though, some graphic blood, and one very gross yet funny scene where James's character throws up on a downed opponent.  ALMOST family-friendly - for the jaded movie environment these days, that's about as close as you're going to get!  The funniest scene is when James tries to win a bet with the winsome Selma Hayek about dunking a basketball, uses a trampoline, and misses it anyway.

The ending is typical Hollywood unrealisticness, but hey, it's heartwarming and (if I forgot to say it yet), funny.",1361664000,,1499,4.8203125

I am happy to see a movie return back to core basics, with a good plot, a neat ending and a point to support it (that is realistic and tangible to emotional appeal). Kevin James has played in a lot of bad movies (just my opinion) and I think he came out fantastic in this one-hope restored.

I expected this to be totally formulaic, predictable, cheesy, and all the other things we come to appreciate in this genre. The school teacher hero thing has been overplayed and poorly played so many times. However, this was a little more creative than expected with just enough surprises to keep you interested. Granted, it was still cheesy and predictable in ways, but somewhat inspirational in a more genuine way. I guess you have to see it to find out. I think kids starting at age 8 would appreciate this movie, but I found some of the fighting scenes (MMA) a little hard to stomach at times. Henry Winkler is really great and So is Kevin James.

Henry Winkler plays a very different character than what we are used to seeing.
Kevin James is his usual likeable self.

Selma Hayek is the hottie in the film.

You can feel safe watching this with the kids.  Yes- the fight scenes are a bit much, but you can't white wash fight scenes.

And those scenes are integral to the movie so they could not be eliminated. If anything , the roughness of the fights show the main character's deep devotion to his cause.",1361491200,,571,4.339622641509434

4771215,5,B005LAII1W,"As a huge fan of both MMA and Kevin James, there was little doubt that I was going to be entertained by this movie. The rest of the cast made sure that it became a film I will rewatch many times over the coming years.

The story is your basic underdog overcomes the odds affair, but the ride makes the cliched ending payoff in spades. Mr. James, as school teacher Scott Voss, remains the very likeable, funny guy we've come to love through his stand-up act and his years of playing Doug Heffernan on the King of Queens. In fact, Gary Valentine, who plays his brother on King of Queens, reprises that role in the film. He's a great comedic partner for Kevin and his few scenes in the movie are excellent.

The Adrian to James's Rocky is the gorgeous Salam Hayek. The pair have a decent chemistry and the warm-hearted journey from rejection to romance is believable. Playing the music teahcer who is in danger of losing his job - and the impetus for James's transformation from Biology teacher to MMA fighter - is Henry Winkler. As someone who grew up in the heyday of Winkler's Fonzie days, I'm always amazed at how easily he's shed that character over the years. As James' side-kick, he's very sweet and has a few great comic moments.

As great as James is, the movie wouldn't be half as good without the awesome Bas Ruten. This legendary MMA fighter almost steals the show with his performace as the goofy-yet-sincere trainer.

The fighting scenes are decent enough throughout, and the appearance of several real-life MMA fighters is a treat. Jason ""Mayhem"" Miller, Mark ""The Phillipino Wrecking Machine"" Munoz, and Krzysztof Soszynski in the Clubber Lang/Ivan Drago role, all add a nice sense of authenticity to the film. Mark DellGrotte, one of MMA's elite trainers, does a great job as James's trainer in the latter part of the film.

Funny, sweet, and action-packed is the best way I can describe Here Comes The Boom and I enjoyed it tremendously.",1361318400,,1952,4.662790697674419
4771216,5,B005LAII1W,"This is an amazing family friendly movie. Yes there is fighting, yes there is blood, and yes there is bodily fluids. But c'mon what did you really expect to see when watching a teacher mma boxing and fighting to save the music program? Tutu's and butterflies? This has a great plot with great characters. This movie is as inspiring as Music of the Heart. Anyone remember that movie? This is a great family film that has great moral backing and teaches people to fight in what they believe in, no matter the obstacles laid out in front of you.

4771832,5,B005LAII1W,"Let me be clear, I am not a MMA fan. I respect it, but I don't watch it. So, I think I understand why some folks can write one star review of this film. However, I suspect it has to do more with them than the film itself. More on that in a bit.
Why I like this film:
* This film was soft-core Capra at is best
* Redemption and simple heroics at its core
* Henry Winkler, who I will watch any day anywhere - even that lousy Viet Nam flick from the 70's.
* Bas Rutten - Who is simultaneously Goofy and Dangerous. I hate cameos by athletes that can't act. Bas rocks in this film. The stuff between him and Henry is really fun.
* Krzysztof Soszynski - who was willing to get his **** kicked on film by a comedian that could clearly not kick his ass.
* This simplicity of the storyline
* Selma Hayek - Always beautiful, and this may be the first time I have ever seen her teeth when she smiles
* And finally, I am a bit envious of the fact that Kevin was able to make a film that allowed him to get in such good shape. Paid to play.
Back to the naysayers; you cannot expect every film with a comedian in it to make you laugh. On one side you have films like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind or The Number 23 that have no laughs with one of the funniest men in the world. Films clearly meant to show that Jim Carrey can act.
Here comes the Boom on the other hand, is an attempt to show there is irony and comedy even in the most intense situations. This is the classic `one man against the system' film showing that it takes effort and you can pay a price for doing the right thing.
Some people want Kevin to be a clown. This film would have been bad if he had played it for laughs. Instead he played it like a hero; the common man that, in a time of crisis, rises to the occasion.
This film will make you laugh occasionally. More important, it will inspire you.",1360972800,3,1861,3.991957104557641

4771927,4,B005LAII1W,A pleasant surprise and genuinely moving as a family comedy. Starting to have an appreciation for Kevin James after Zookeeper and this. PS. I'm a movie snob and this is a big admission.,1360800000,,185,4.636363636363637

4771929,4,B005LAII1W,I was pleasently surprised. The movie was pretty entertaining all the way through. It had a storybook ending but that's OK now and then.,1360800000,,136,4.708333333333333
4772040,5,B005LAII1W,"Love it! It was funny, clean, no sexual content, no cussing. Great Family Movie!!!! It was an all around good movie!",1360800000,,116,4.571428571428571

This movie was hilarious! Plus it has some guest stars from the
MMA community!",1360800000,,137,4.52
4772042,5,B005LAII1W,I love UFC stuff and I just can't believe how clean and entretaining this movie is. My kids loved it!,1360800000,,101,4.1
4772043,5,B005LAII1W,I was not expecting this movie to be as good as it was. I was expecting a regular comedy with a sports theme but I was wrong. This movie is actually one of the best underdog stories I have seen in a long time. The comedy of the movie just adds to it but it is not the main selling point. Kevin James did a good job actually looking like a mma fighter. I definitely recommend this movie to anybody who likes mma or even just sports underdog stories. You will not regret it.,1360800000,23,472,4.031914893617022
4772044,3,B005LAII1W,Great comedy that can be watched with the family. Has a positive ending and some great laughs throughout. Kevin James has a great way of putting the comedy in!,1360800000,,159,4.517241379310345

4772046,5,B005LAII1W,"Movies generally go too far with some things these days. I thought it was balanced and a pleasant surprise that they spent the time to put some meaning in different directions. It's a good feel good flick, which I like.",1360800000,,219,4.5
4772047,3,B005LAII1W,"It was pretty Funny, I would tell any one to watch it, don't think I'd purches the DVD for my collection",1360800000,,104,4.0
4772048,4,B005LAII1W,"Didn't think I'd like this movie. ""Boom"" definitely has its comedic moments. I expected to laugh since I've always enjoyed Kevin James humor and really enjoyed Mall Cop. What I didn't expect was how much the screenplay and performance by James would make me care about the resolution of the narrative. At the end, during the final fight scene, I even found myself forgetting that it was a movie and rooting for James.

Also, casting Bas Rutten as James' coach was brilliant. Wonderfully comedic performance from the former MMA fighter.",1360800000,,535,4.944444444444445
4772049,5,B005LAII1W,"I was skeptical that this movie would be as good as it turned out to be.
A 41 year old biology takes up ultimate fighting to save the music program.
Henry Winkler really steals the show with his charm and wit, truly refreshing.
There is romance-Salma Hayek; need I say more.
It has a surprise ending and some really clever twists and turns---a good plot.
Overall, my wife and I loved this film and generally we like any movie that includes Kevin James.",1360800000,,452,4.457831325301205

4772158,5,B005LAII1W,"Finally a movie with my kids or with my parents! Great feel good movie. It went thru great emotions: happy, excitement, anger, love, pride.
It might be a little predictable or even cheesy for some, but I enjoyed it so much better to other movies out there where I have to close my kids eyes or turn away myself.",1360713600,,311,4.288135593220339
4772159,5,B005LAII1W,Entertaining and not so much vulgarity making it decent for young people or Christians to watch.  Great characters with innocence in romance.,1360713600,,141,5.409090909090909

4772235,3,B005LAII1W,"I heard great reviews of this movie, so my expectations were up.  But it wasn't as funny as I had hoped.  The movie was good, acting was good, etc, it just wasn't great.  Also, the story was almost exactly like Warrior.  And Warrior was a much better UFC movie, although this one was probably a little safer for the kids.",1360713600,,321,4.3

4772330,5,B005LAII1W,"Man!!!  This film wasn't what I expected at all, saw it in the theaters when it first came out.  I must say it was worth the money, SO much in fact that I had to watch it again.  Wish more individuals were like the main character of the film though.  NOT saying they should go out and subject themselves to getting beat up for a cause, LOL... Just saying thinking more of someone else rather then just themselves.

Would definitely recommend the film",1360713600,,450,4.373493975903615

4772338,5,B005LAII1W,"I have always been a fan of Kevin James.  He plays the determined underdog very well.  This movie is a more family friendly Rocky story.  I watched this with my family and everyone from my 7 year old son to my mother in her 60s were on the edge of their seats.  This is a story about determination to do the right thing for the right reasons.  A nice ensemble cast that plays off of each other well.  It is always a pleasure to see Henry Winkler at work too.  The lesson here is that no matter how screwed up the world is, people can make a difference.  And you get to laugh and cheer while getting the lesson.",1360627200,,610,4.067226890756302

4772364,4,B005LAII1W,Great movie lots of fun. The sound quality was terrible and made it difficult to hear which took away from the movie but if you get a good rental with good sound the movie was a lot of fun,1360627200,,188,3.8461538461538463

4772366,4,B005LAII1W,"I thought this was a pretty well done movie.  It takes the usual plot of a school in trouble and the underdog steps in to make a difference, and adds the MMA twist.  The MMA guys in the film aren't great actors, but it works.  I will say that it is a little rough to be rated PG, the fights get a little graphic.  YMMV.",1360627200,,319,3.8615384615384616

4772453,5,B005LAII1W,My family and I saw the preview for this movie and thought it would be a fun watch. Maybe not so great for those looking for more grown up comedy. Probably not for too small children although the violence is not over the top it might get the little ones riled up wanting to kick and what not. Over all my family enjoyed it.,1360627200,,323,4.0625

4772653,4,B005LAII1W,"Despite being a Kevin James fan, this movie didn't strike any real interest for me on the big screen. But after seeing the positive reviews, thought I'd give it a chance.

Boy, am I glad I did. This is, quite honestly, one of the best non-animated family films I've seen in a while--a genre that's, sadly, almost extinct.

The story is pretty simple but there's a pretty solid moral compass throughout--and a really great theme of seeing things through, regardless of difficulty. The characters are really what make the film. Winkler, in the first fairly-major role I've seen in some time, is very believable as the passionate about-to-be-downsized music instructor. And the training sequences with his trainer Nico are really funny. In my opinion, Mark DellaGrotte steals the show as the hard-core MMA professor who gets him James ready for the big fight. And Hayek is... well, what more needs to be said... James, of course, is vintage in his role as lazy and unassuming at first, turning to unwavering and committed late.

All-in-all, this is not only a good rent but one I'll probably add to the collection of those owned soon. Enjoy!",1360454400,,1138,4.855670103092783

If you've seen the trailers then you'll know if you're going to like this movie.  It is very well done!  I've been waiting for it to be released for a long time and knew I would like it.  Kevin James, Henry Winkler, Selma Hayek - what is not to like here?

My mother likes similar movies to me and she liked this one a lot too.  I like that it's rated PG and there's not unnecessary violence or swear words.  It's good for all ages, nothing inappropriate or offensive.

It's just about doing something with your life, owning your responsibilities and helping the people that matter, people more vulnerable than you are.  I'd highly recommend buying or renting this movie.

4772808,2,B005LAII1W,"This film takes the up-and-coming popularity of Mixed Martial Arts and just drops it into the formulaic Hollywood mold. Look, I'm a huge MMA fan, enough to quickly recognize cameos from professional fighters like Mayhem Miller, Chael Sonnen, Romolo Barral, Mark Munoz, and Krzysztof Soszynski. Unfortunately, that just wasn't enough to save this film for me and make this comedy funny or entertaining. Henry Winkler and Bas Rutten do provide some comic relief, but sparingly. Unfortunately, the whole is far less than the sum of its' parts, and proves that a quality cast, good direction and cinematography, and potentially interesting script do not necessarily equal entertainment. It it appears that Kevin James' career path is on the same trajectory as Adam Sandler, which is to churn out hit-or-miss comedies that may kill at the box office but are actually low on comedic value.

As an undercurrent, I know Kevin James is a huge MMA/UFC fan, and this is certainly his attempt to help make the sport more mainstream, but not sure it does so successfully.  There is really no reason to detail all the parts that don't make sense, but there are quite a few.  Understanding there is a lot of Hollywood license here related to MMA is an understatement. I'm not sure if the target audience was MMA fans, because if it was, it is blatantly absurd, and even insulting to guys that actually train and put the time in to be professional fighters. If it was targeted at non-MMA fans or those on the fence, I'm not sure it peaks their curiosity or just vindicates the fact they already think MMA is pointless. Either way, not sure it helps the cause.

I'll give it credit for taking perhaps the only sport that hasn't been bastardized in comedy yet. But if the sports-comedy genre appeals to you, then just realize Happy Gilmore, Dodgeball, Kingpin, Major League, Waterboy, or Caddyshack it ain't.",1360108800,3,1890,4.8602484472049685

  Kevin James breaks the mold on a new persona as school teacher Mr. Voss and nails it.  As a teacher caught in the dreary existence of ""staying stagnant"".  As the storyline progresses, Mr. Voss' school is forced to make dramatic cuts to academic programs, including the music program.  Mr. Voss learns beforehand that the music teacher is expecting a child in the household.  This leads Mr. Voss to a go at it and get it attitude to save the school's academia, and the pursuit of MMA Cage Matches to fund them.

The storyline is a bit cliche, and predictable, but it follows true to a Rockyesque feature film that brings far more into the picture than first meets the eye.  This movie is about truly being; stand up for yourself, stand up for your fellow man, and you can accomplish anything.

The feeling going in, throughout, and after the movie stayed true.  It was as motivational as it was humorous, and this is a feat that is hard to accomplish in movies, especially with a PG rating.

You will not be disappointed by this movie. Go in expecting to get a few laughs and you will find that you walk away with something more.

Kevin James plays Scott Voss a relatively burnt-out teacher who finally gets enthusiastic again when he sees the one teacher (played by Henry Winkler) at his inner-city school who was still enthusiastic about his work facing the budgetary axe.

Not knowing exactly what to do, Voss simply tries everything to fund-raise to save his imperiled colleague's job, including, finally, submitting to simply getting beaten-up for money at MMA prize fights.  Now Voss, we're told had been ""a wrestler in high school/college.""  So he's not completely defenseless.  However, when he first takes up this idea of entering into MMA prize fights, he does just get beat-upon.  However, Voss' renewed enthusiasm proves contagious.  And since this is a Hollywood movie, most could guess how the story ends... ;-)

The story argues a counter point to those who'd argue that one ""needs a plan"" before seeking to right a wrong.  Simple, heart-felt action can inspire everybody / lift everybody up and yes, ""change the world.""

  Scott Voss (played by Kevin James) is a 42 year-old biology teacher. Ten years ago, he was given a Teacher of the Year award but when we join the story, he's sleeping late, making little or no effort in the classroom and seen as an embarrassment by the principal, Mr. Betcher (played by Greg Germann).  When Betcher (Germann) catches him sneaking into class late via the classroom window, he gives Voss parking lot duty and strips him of a vacation day. Rather than accept more work that he's in no way interested in doing, he tries to find someone to fill in for him. His colleague, Marty, the music teacher (played by Henry Winkler) is more than willing to assume the responsibility but also a little shaken by the news that his wife is pregnant. Later, at a school board budget meeting, he's given the even more troubling news that thanks to budget problems, the music program is in jeopardy. Voss, despite his long-standing apathy, offers to raise money to save the music program and his colleague's job. He resumes the job of teaching citizenship classes in night school but sees that the wages would make it near-impossible to earn the money in time. One of his students, Niko (played by Bas Rutten) asks for additional tutoring and Voss agrees, reluctantly. It is during a tutoring session at Niko's apartment that Voss, who wrestled in college, sees a mixed martial arts match, learns that the loser was paid $10,000, and decides he can raise the money by joining this very punishing sport.

  Now, the last Kevin James movie that I saw in theaters was Zookeeper. I wasn't impressed. I won't say that Here Comes the Boom was impressive, but it was easily a step up from Zookeeper. Also, naming the movie after what would eventually become the main character's theme song isn't particularly creative. Still, I was entertained. Watching an overweight 42 year-old enter the ring and take serious punishment over and over...and over was hilarious and watching the effect his decision to make an effort had, not just on him but on the entire cast of characters, was bizarrely uplifting.

4772910,4,B005LAII1W,"Attention! Kevin James fans (and you are legion): this time he's a high-school biology teacher turned reluctant Mixed Martial Arts contestant in a frantic attempt to raise money for the music program in his financially strapped school. The lesson we take away is the value of perseverance, honesty and hard work.

We see:
  * Kevin James (""Zookeeper"") is Scott Voss, a weary, uninspired high-school biology teacher. He was a college wrestler, but now just wants to put in his time. Oh yes, he also lusts after the school nurse. James seems to have successfully made the transition from TV's long-running The King of Queens to a movie career.
  * Salma Hayek (""Savages"") is Bella Flores, the school nurse who insists that anyone who courts her shows respect and good manners. I love how she shoves that loudmouth MMA fan at the final bout! Hayek seems to alternate between light-hearted comedies and tough dramas.
  * Henry Winkler (""Royal Pains"") is Marty Streb, the gentle music teacher who is devastated to learn that he will be unemployed when his music program is axed. Winkler is enjoying a full, rich actor's life, despite his iconic role years ago as The Fonz.
  * Greg Germann (""Ally McBeal"" and lots of TV) is Mr. Belcher, the high-school principal who decides to discontinue the music program but keep the football team. Germann seems to specialize in characters who are morally compromised.
  * Gary Valentine (""Paul Blart: Mall Cop"") is Marty Voss, our hero's brother. His passion is cooking, despite evidence to the contrary.... Mr. Valentine is a stand-up comic who has appeared in a number of Kevin James' projects; they're brothers, so it makes sense.
  * Reggie Lee (""Safe"") is Mr. De La Cruz, the father of a high-school musician. He has a restaurant to run and wants his daughter to help. This is a nice change of pace for Mr. Lee: he often plays cold-blooded Asian killers!
  * Joe Rogan is a Mixed Martial Arts commentator and a stand-up comic who holds black belts and other achievements in martial arts, including a black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. He is one of many MMA competitors who appear in this movie.
  * Charice who played Malia De La Cruz (Dubbed by Oprah as ""The most talented girl in the world"" and an amazing international singer) This is an addition provided by another Amazon reader. Thanks!

To me, this film was notable for a couple of moments: 1) During an American studies evening class for immigrants studying for their citizenship, our hero pauses to allow the AA group in an adjacent classroom to complete their prayer; 2) Before his bout, our four guys form a circle, join hands and have a moment of silence. Both of these moments are unusual in their consideration for religious beliefs. I'm not a religious person, but I found on-screen respect for those who are, to be refreshing.

Despite the brutality of MMA bouts, our hero is a decent, kind and mildly selfish fellow, who matures as he embraces a purpose larger than himself. Not a bad thing.... (Spoiler Alert!) We get to enjoy a nice goose-bumpy clichd happy ending!

Scott nonchalantly mentions about raising money to save the music department, while no one else in interested except for Salma Hayek...guess how that turns out.

Eventually Scott takes to the ring to be an amateur mix arts fighter with the help of his Dutch immigrant student as a trainer.

The plot is improbable, predictable, and designed for a teen audience. The dialouge is always humorous, but never rip roaring funny. For example:

In fact, for me, this movie works on just about every level and I think it succeeds in what it was intended to be - clean family entertainment.  They even made it feel plausible (somewhat) that Kevin James could compete at the sport.  The fight scenes were intense - almost Warrior quality and I'm surprized it came away with just a PG for that reason.

So - I'm giving this (somewhat predictable) family drama, comedy, sports film a hearty recommendation. If you want a complete synopsis, history and credit listing, read some of long reviews. I'd suggest you just watch Here Comes the Boom instead.",1353369600,4,1001,4.6440677966101696
4772916,4,B005LAII1W,"Judging by the general premise - comical underdog goes up against impossible odds to save school program and get the girl - Here Comes the Boom was probably intended to be a B-grade Hollywood formula movie.  And to be honest, about half of it is just that and nothing more.  But the other half of Here Comes the Boom will surprise you with some outstanding performances and moments of pure grace that make the film definitely worth the price of admission.

Scott Voss (Kevin James) is a 42-year-old biology high school teacher who was voted Teacher of the Year... ten years ago.  Nowadays Scott can barely motivate himself to show up, let alone motivate his students.  Or the school nurse, Bella Flores (Salma Hayek) who keeps shooting him down every time he tries to ask her out.  This abruptly changes however at a staff meeting where Principal Betcher (Greg Germann) announces that, due to a $48K budget shortfall, all extracurricular programs at the school are being cut, including the music program taught by Scott's friend Marty (Henry Winkler), an older teacher who's just learned that his wife is about to have another baby.  Knowing what the loss of his job would mean to Marty, Scott stands up and to everyone's surprise, including his own, vows to find some way to raise the needed money to save the music program and Marty's job.

Actually coming up with the money however - which Scott has to do by the end of the semester - proves to be a seemingly impossible challenge.  He takes a second job teaching a night-school class helping immigrants prepare for their citizenship examination, but the extra money isn't going to be anywhere near enough to reach the $48K needed.  The class does however bring him into contact with an eager immigrant from Holland named Niko (a marvelous scene-stealing Bas Rutten) who needs some extra tutoring for the exam. When Scott goes over to Niko's place for a tutoring session, he is drawn by Niko and a couple of his buddies into watching a UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) match that's already underway on the TV.  He learns that Niko used to be an MMA (mixed martial arts) fighter himself before injuries sidelined him.  More importantly, he learns that the loser in a UFC match receives $10K for the fight.  And suddenly Scott sees a way he can get the money he needs for the school.  After all, he used to be on the wrestling team in college.  And how hard could losing be, right?

A lot harder than he was expecting, Scott discovers, when Niko reluctantly agrees to train him.  Aside from the grueling effort required for an out of shape 42-year-old trying to get back into the kind of shape he was in twenty years earlier, there's the matter of his having to take a serious beating on a daily basis in the process.  After the first couple of sessions Scott is ready to throw in the towel.  But he soon finds he's got too many people in his corner to even think of quitting.  Besides good-natured Niko and his fighting buddies, there's one of his students, Malia (Charice) to whom Marty's music program really matters and who pitches in by helping Niko study for his citizenship exam while Scott's busy training.  Bella, though she thinks Scott is crazy, does her part by helping to patch him up, gradually warming up to him in the process.  And Marty himself is helping out in his well-meaning but frequently clueless way, but it is Marty who ends up making one of the most significant contributions to Scott's effort.  When another fighter steals the walk-in song Scott was using - P.O.D.'s ""Boom"" - Marty ends up substituting Neal Diamond's ""Holy, Holy"", which becomes Scott's signature theme when he ends up unexpectedly winning the match.  And when the video of his win goes viral - mainly because Scott throws up on his opponent - he finds that the whole student body is suddenly rooting for him.  Bout by punishing bout, Scott slowly but steadily raises the money for the school, and soon his underdog rise gets him the attention of the UFC and he finds himself on the undercard for the UFC's big night in Las Vegas.  But just when it looks like Scott's win-by-losing plan is going to be able to save the school's music program, an unexpected development throws his entire effort off the rails and suddenly he's faced with the impossible prospect that he now must actually win his fight - and the $50K prize - in order to save the day.

The basic plot, as you can see, is very familiar thematic ground, a mash-up of Rocky and Mr. Holland's Opus and a hundred similar movies that have been standard Hollywood fare for decades.  In addition to the not overly imaginative script, which also suffers from subplots that distract rather than really contribute, the film also suffers from Frank Coraci's somewhat erratic direction.  Coraci's record as a comedy director is mixed.  His biggest successes were the films he with Adam Sandler - The Waterboy and The Wedding Singer (both 1998) and Click (2006).  The rest of his record is less stellar, consisting of the middling Zookeeper (2011) and the outright bomb Around the World in 80 Days (2004).  In Here Comes the Boom, Coraci's biggest weakness as a director is that there are far too many what I call ""dead fish"" moments where a scene clearly isn't working but the film lingers on it, as if hoping that it will somehow get funny if given more time.  Which it invariably doesn't, causing the film to really drag in places.

But all that said, two things make Here Comes the Boom rise above what one would usually expect of this kind of film:  the performances and the fight scenes.  Kevin James makes his Scott Voss character believable as the improbable hero, the likeable but seemingly apathetic shlub who surprises himself by stepping up when no one else does.  Who time and again wants to quit but can't bring himself to let the people who depend on him down.  And in the key moments, James convinces you that, for all of his goofiness, Scott does indeed have what it takes to put himself through considerable pain for a cause he's committed himself to.  Salma Hayek is somewhat miscast as Bella - seriously, did anyone ever have a school nurse that stunningly gorgeous? -  but does a creditable job of being the down to earth no-nonsense object of Scott's romantic interest, particularly in one comic scene where she proceeds to take him down like a practice dummy - having grown up with four older brothers, she's clearly learned a thing or two - trying to show him that he doesn't know what he's getting into with the MMA plan.  Henry Winkler shines as the music teacher Marty, showing a man who truly loves what he does and who cares deeply about his work and his students - you can easily see why Scott would go to bat for him - but who is clearly out of his depth on anything else, always well-meaning but frequently clueless.  Winkler is surprisingly deft with comedy, turning the most ordinary lines into delightfully comic moments simply by the voice and facial expressions he uses to deliver them.

Two other excellent performances are Charice's Malia, the student who has Scott as her biology teacher and Marty as her music teacher, and Bas Rutten's roughly genial Niko, the former MMA fighter who now teaches yoga and jazzercise classes at the community college.  Charice, whom most people would only know from the Sunshine Corazon character she played in three episodes of the TV series Glee, is infectiously appealing, projecting worry and upbeat optimism as the scene requires.  One of the movie's best scenes involves Malia coaching and encouraging Niko for his citizenship exam, and another is when she and the other music students unexpectedly turn up at Scott's climactic bout to cheer - and sing - him on.  But it is Bas Rutten's Niko who brings the most natural humor to the film, shamelessly playing his role to the hilt and stealing virtually every scene he's in.  A former MMA fighter himself, Rutten is perfect for the role, but in addition to having the background, Rutten is gifted with one of those faces that, when he grins at you, you feel an overwhelming compulsion to grin back.  He just radiates a kind of empathy that draws you in.  So you completely buy into the comedic situation of this rough-looking guy who used to fight for a living now getting up in spandex to lead classes of women in burning fat away by working out on stationary bikes with a disco ball sparkling overhead.  The man has a brilliant future as a character actor if he wants it, which I hope he does as I'd love to see more of him in future films.

Another really well-done feature of the film is the way the fight scenes - and the martial arts scene in general - were done, in no small part due to the involvement of a lot of actual MMA fighters and personalities.  Some are in the film playing themselves, like UFC announcers Joe Rogan, Mike Goldberg and Bruce Buffer, MMA referee Herb Dean, and Muay Thai trainer Mark DellaGrotta.  Actual UFC fighters Wanderlei Silva, Chael Sonnen, Brian Stann and Rich Franklin make appearances.  And UFC fighter Krzysztof Soszynski has a key role as Ken ""The Executioner"" Dietrich, the inhumanly scary-looking fighter Scott finds himself up against in the climactic fight in Las Vegas.  The actual involvement of so many prominent people from the UFC and MMA world gives Here Comes the Boom a level of realism that it could not otherwise have achieved, and I'm sure that their input is the reason that the fight scenes come across as realistic as they do. You really do feel like Kevin James is going through some real smack-downs in the course of the film.

Recommended for anyone who likes Kevin James and/or a feel-good underdog-against-the-odds comedy which manages to be better than you'd expect.  And in particular for Bas Rutten's unexpectedly delightful performance.",1351987200,8,9837,4.703206997084548
4772917,3,B005LAII1W,"From my wife Sarah: We love Kevin James and we needed a good laugh so we chose this movie. It was mildly amusing at times, but unfortunately it wasn't great. Here's the pros and cons:

PROS:

1. The actors are good - Kevin James is so likable and he's got great comic ability. We've seen him live at a comedy club and we laughed until it hurt. In this movie there were some moments that were pretty funny, but most of them were in the trailer.

Salma Heyak is always beautiful and a great actress, and Henry Winkler was great as always.

2. The message - Some of the message of the movie was decent, but some of it wasn't what I'd want to teach my kids.

Cons:

1. A poor script - It was totally unbelievable on so many levels, which is fine if it's a very funny movie, but unfortunately it usually wasn't. The character development was not only thin, but the things Kevin James character did was utterly out of character. It kind of made me tune out.

2. GRAPHIC VIOLENCE - I couldn't believe all the children in the theater given the level of graphic violence and blood. I found Hunger Games to be far less violent. I was cringing and covering my eyes at times. This took up a large portion of the movie. THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR PRE-TEENS.

So for those older than pre-teens this movie might be worth watching on cable if there's nothing else better to watch, or if you're a huge mixed martial arts fan.

Sorry Kevin James - we love you, but Hitch is the best movie you've made and I hope you find others as good. It was clean, hilarious, romantic and had heart. Plus if you come do stand-up in South Florida again we'll be the first in line for tickets!",1350172800,3,1654,4.24203821656051
4772918,4,B005LAII1W,"Kevin James fills that niche. The one that his pal Adam Sandler surrendered years ago when he opted for those loopy roles. Kevin James remains very much down-to-earth and relatable. He's that likable everyman. HERE COMES THE BOOM is all kinds of predictable. It strives to mash-up two of cinema's most enduring narratives: the plight of teachers under duress and the inspirational underdog sports story. I was ready to roll my eyes a lot at this film. I walked out of the theater grinning. HERE COMES THE BOOM follows convention, does it ever. There's no earthshaking plot twist. But the film's expert execution of those tropes and Kevin James' warm, committed performance won me over. And there are enough laughs. And I'm a devoted enough sports fan. And I'll always root for endeavors that promote educators and expose the disadvantages that hinder them from doing their job. That Salma Hayek is in the movie doesn't suck, either. Her character's name is Bella, and I'd be hard pressed to think of something else more appropriate to call her.

Once upon a time, 42-year-old high school biology teacher Scott Voss (James) won the Teacher of the Year honors. But that was a decade ago, and he's since lost his spark. Today Scott Voss is an indifferent cog in Boston's educational system. But when budget cutbacks threaten to eliminate the school's extracurricular activities - including his friend Marty's (Henry Winkler) music department - Scott Voss is galvanized impetuously into action. Except how do you now raise $48,000, especially in the face of a looming deadline?

Once upon a time, Scott Voss was a Division One collegiate wrestler, a pretty good one, never mind that that was two decades ago. Scott arrives at the deranged idea of competing in the mixed martial arts circuit to drum up money for his school. You'd think the fact that he doesn't know much about the MMA sport would give him pause... Anyway, early on, anticipate scenes of Scott's getting harshly beat down.

By the way, I like that his ring walks are serenaded by a Neil Diamond track. Makes me smile.

Oh, most critics will hate this film. They won't take into the equation that there's a sweetness to this story, that there's heart and warm sentiment nestled in that gauntlet of cliches. Thankfully, the story isn't too sanitized. There's some bite to it. There's even a moment in which a debate surfaces regarding the validity and morality of resorting to violence, even if it's only in a sporting venue, in order to resolve a school's financial dilemma. I'm not sure that the film adequately addresses that. But let's not get too mired in deep moralizing. This movie isn't trying to change the world. It's trying to entertain you. There's a time and place and a mood for these kinds of films. There's a time for navel-gazing, and a time for popcorn and twizzlers.

To my surprise, Kevin James and Salma Hayak manage to ignite a few sparks. I'm not saying they replicate that heat between Richard Gere and Debra Winger, but, after a while, I bought into James' character actually having a shot with Hayak's school nurse, never mind that she'd already rejected him the fifteen times he'd asked her out. But there's a nice, easy rapport in their interactions. Note that, this time, Hayak's sexy nurse isn't singing back-up or possessed by a malevolent creature from outer space.

I suppose the presence of MMA fighters and personalities lends credibility. Fight commentators Joe Rogan and Mike Goldberg play themselves. MMA fighter Krzysztof Soszynski (not playing himself) squares up with Scott in the Octagon. But Bas Rutten turns in one of the best performances, playing Nico, an outlandish, scene-stealing former MMA fighter who trains Scott in exchange for getting tutored as he bones up for his coming U.S. citizenship exam.

I don't know if, like I heard in a Bas Rutten interview, Kevin James had trained for 14 months going into this film, but I'm happy to say that he doesn't embarass himself. Kevin has got that unsvelte, bearish figure, but he did get into a decent enough shape, considering. And it's not like his character is playing this elite gladiator, anyway. Scott Voss's clumsy, amateurish style is based on his playing defense and getting lucky with a strike. His chances of winning rely more on his perseverence thru sheer gumption and an ability to absorb punches and a stone-cold reluctance to disappoint his students. It makes you root for him all the more. So set aside the artsy-fartsy mindset, assemble the homies, and check out this feel-good show. In the face of impending ridicule, I'm rating HERE COMES THE BOOM 4 out of 5 stars. I really enjoyed it.",1350086400,96,4661,4.870113493064313
4772919,5,B005LAII1W,"I first have to say that as a woman I am not a big fan of mixed martial arts.  However, having said that, I really, REALLY loved this film.

I went to see this film expecting a light comedy with the always lovable Everyman Kevin James.  What I didn't expect was that it would be as great a movie as it was -- you come out feeling inspired to re-connect with what is the best  and brightest in you and use that to change your world and THE world.  (Wow!  Who would have expected that from a comedy?)

We start off meeting Kevin James's character -- a high school teacher who once was passionate about helping his students but has long ago lost that -- as he discovers that a fellow teacher friend (played by crowd favorite Henry Winkler) will be losing his job. (Budget cutbacks are requiring the school to cut the music program.)

With more heart than thought, Kevin James' character proposes that they raise the money needed to save the music program.  He then tries various ways to make that happen but none seem to help -- until one of his students introduces him to mixed martial arts.  He sees that as a way to earn the money the school needs and so proceeds to throw his body, mind and -- eventually -- heart fully into the effort.  Along the way, the passion he feels for getting his friend's job back and helping the music students starts to spread to other areas of his life.

Eventually, he is fully alive again -- not only making a difference in his own but also in the lives of everyone around him.  His passion is contagious and -- like a wildfire -- spreads to everyone around him -- their world starts to change for the better.

What a truly inspiring film -- it makes me think back to other great inspirational, moving comedies of the past few years like Jim Carrey's ""Yes Man"" and even ""As Good As It Gets"".

We live in a time with great uncertainty about the future where it sometimes seems like every day just keeps sliding deeper and deeper downhill towards a point where all hope seems to be lost.  This film is an excellent antidote to that -- it makes you look into yourself and reclaim the hero that lies within you  (my apologies to Joseph Campbell and Mariah Carey ;-) ).

The audience cheered and laughed all the way through the movie but no more than in the end -- which got a standing ovation.  Everyone was saying how they expected it to be a good movie but it was so much better than they had even expected.  (And... the mixed martial arts fans I had overheard thought those scenes were entertaining too!)

If you want to re-kindle your passion for life and have a good time in the process, do yourself a favor and please see ""Here comes the Boom"".  Kevin James -- please keep writing and acting -- we need more films like this!",1350086400,3,2759,4.337231968810916
