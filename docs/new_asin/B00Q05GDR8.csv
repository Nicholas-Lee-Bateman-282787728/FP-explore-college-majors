6839411,5,B00Q05GDR8,"This documentary is a collaborations of African American photographers work of art. A body of work which cannot be placed in a specific genre.  It is a work that illustrates African American history, wealth, love, and family. The narration speaks to an audience that would not have noticed the missing family members in certain photos, the mentoring along with the responsibility to take photographs, or the included individuals that were invisible to society.

The narration captures the disappointment  by one of the photographers when his resume of exceptional work surprised an initial client's commissioned project. The client didn't know he was African American.

These photographers picked up the camera and revealed images that would have been lost or deemed irrelevant for its audience consumption. Through a lens these photographers are artist.",1424217600,10,854,5.4961832061068705
6839412,5,B00Q05GDR8,"Just in time for Black History Month comes the DVD of this landmark documentary on African American photographers. Not just modern ones, but going back to 1840! As a white American I never really gave thought to why I knew the names of many great photographers but the only black photographer I could name was  Gordon Parks, known mostly for his photography for Life Magazine - and later as director of the film ""The Learning Tree"".  Though Parks is - surprisingly - not mentioned in this film, a wealth of portraits by black photographers is covered in the 2013 film's 92 minutes.  You know how important this project is when you get to the final credits. Between the lengthy list of ""Interns"", ""Donors"" and ""Archives"", the credits run almost six minutes!

The film is Executive produced by Deborah Willis, upon whose book the film is based. Well-known black film director John Singleton (""Boys in the Hood"", etc.) is another Executive Producer. The wonderful score was composed by Vernon Reid from the band Living Colour.

Director/Writer Thomas Allen Harris self-narrates the film and explains how he and his brother - also a photographer - got their first cameras from their father who told them to ""go out and capture the world"". He explains that it's a tradition in black families to have family portraits taken and compile ""family albums"". Using images from these albums, and contrasting them with racist images of blacks used in advertising until the mid 1950s, Harris shows us all what the typical black family looked like and how they lived.

There are useful bonuses on the DVD In addition to bios of not only the film's producing team, but the interviews and the photographers mentioned in the fil, there are 14 very short (most less than a minute) videos about the Digital Diaspora Video Reunion  (DDVR) project which goes to cities around the US and asks black families to bring their family albums and record their stories for future generations.

If you have an interest in photography or Black Studies or just want to see a fine documentary, I can highly recommend this DVD.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8689915,4,B00Q05GDR8,"This topic has always fascinated me, because I knew all too well that film was formulated to favor one shade of skin. Early photographers serving black customers adapted by becoming masters of lighting.  This film also explored the key role of snapshots in connecting families to their histories. How painful to see family albums at flea markets and the like. I always want to scoop them up and find them homes, like kittens.",1520467200,,425,4.821917808219178
