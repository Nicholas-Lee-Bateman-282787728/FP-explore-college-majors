8443077,4,B004V8W578,playback excellent.  movie plots go from good to very good,1440115200,,58,4.8

* The Fear 2 stars the guy that played The Anti-Christ in, the original,

I thought it really WAS a Russian actor [in Left Behind]. His accent was more believable than T-H-I-S extremely bloody
flick's rubber monster.

MUCH longer [time-wise] than its 1:39.
Speaking of its time [1:39], this film's aspect-ratio is 1.85:1, yet the opening and closing credits are window-boxed (that
is, there're black bars all around... not just on the opposite sides); which turns to pan-and-scan for the bulk of the movie,
with black bars, right and left.
Steven Spielberg calls pan-and-scan movies [where 1/3rd of the picture is lost on the sides] ""crap-o-vision"".

Enough said.",1425859200,,1790,7.994974874371859
8443079,5,B004V8W578,a decent dvd set if got it for the third movie within the rock,1417910400,,62,3.5
8443080,4,B004V8W578,"Phantom of the Opera/ The Fear 2/ Within the Rock is a Triple Feature DVD that I bought strictly for Within the Rock. It's a good little movie about an Alien Creature that kills a mining team on an asteroid. In my opinion, the other 2 movies are barely watchable. (Although, I'm sure they have fans, as most z grade movies have fans somewhere.)",1345420800,2,344,4.390625
8443081,3,B004V8W578,"Worth buying for Within The Rock alone as that feature is the best on offer here, A crew on an asteroid (they are there to drill deep enough to blow it up to save earth, yes that old line again) encounter a nasty alien creature.
Fear is about a Halloween party that goes wrong with the guests being slain, not a bad effort for what it is.
Opera was pretty boring, almost putting me to sleep.
So Within The Rock and Fear are not bad for the price of this set.",1309564800,4,458,4.043956043956044
