2849367,4,B000QXDG4S,"I thought this movie was good although I agree that Kimberly was missed. I too was  disappointed.. But the new girl (Sara) did alright--> big shoes to fill don't you think? As far as Debbie goes she could get as much screen time as she wants.. She obviously did not want anymore than what she had. Remember  she is really up in age now.. I know I am 50.. I have watched her movies since I was a little girl.. I very much missed her too in this movie.. I was more disappointed that ""Sophie"" did not a part in this but I was glad ""Dillon"" did.. All in all I liked it.. I hope to see more of Halloweentown with Young Sophie...??",1186099200,27,625,4.073170731707317
2849368,3,B000QXDG4S,"I was extremely disappointed that Kimberly J Brown was not playing Marnie in this movie.  Sara Paxton does an OK job, but it's just not the same since the character of Marnie had been played by the same person in the 3 other movies.  Also, I love love love Debbie Reynolds - she's the reason my family started watching this series.  Unfortunately she is barely in this movie.  I'm talking maybe 5 minutes out of the hour and a half that it runs.
The story line is good and follows the other movies (to a point), but (my opinion) it would've been so much better if Miss Brown had played Marnie instead of another actress and of course, if Debbie Reynolds had been given more screen time.  :)",1184803200,34,690,4.359375

2849394,5,B000QXDG4S,"There is something very unique and quirky about the Disney Channel original Halloween Moviesfundo not pretend to be anything else but kooky and never take themselves seriously. And the Halloween Town movies with Debbie Reynolds are so very special now that she is gone.
As an adult, I am not ashamed to admit I own all the Halloween town movies, The Scream Team, Moms Got a Date with a Vampire, Now You See it, Hocus Pocus and others. They are fit the scare bill more often than the slasher-gore films now being produced. A bit a of a laugh, a bit of a scare, and all comes out fun in the end. I wish Disney would produce a lot more of these films.
Adults need to find the inner-child againand with these movies, you do not need a child with you to discover what you left behind---you just need to let go of the adult. Go, find these movies and enjoy.",1507334400,,851,4.291925465838509

2849481,5,B000QXDG4S,"Halloween time is great for some not so scary movies that do not contain unexcepbale language. Not many kids movies like that any more which is why I chose the Halloween Town series for my grandkids. They are age appropriate for any little viewer and the story is fun and exciting. I am a product reviewer and I would like to invite you to follow my reviews. To do so just click ""follow"". Also, please click ""yes"" if this review helped you decide to purchase or not to purchase this product. I review several items each week from baby items and electronics to lawn and garden, kitchen gadgets to clothing and everything in between. My reviews are truthful and my own (good or bad). I take the selling price into consideration when writing my reviews. If an item sells for $5, I will review the use and quality for a $5 item, I won't compare it to a similar $20 item. That would not be fair. However if any product does not meet my expectations I will honestly state why.  If after a few weeks of use my opinion of this product changes, I will update my review.",1475107200,,1060,4.353535353535354

Just to silently cry over a broken dream of a complete Halloweentown series.  But fear not, Disney just needs to make a new one where it has the original Marnie (maybe even with her own witch babies).  The end.

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!

2849943,5,B000QXDG4S,"In this fourth installment of the Halloweentown movies, Marnie and Dylan are off to college at Witch University in Halloweentown. Professors are trying to use Marnie to uncover an heirloom of her family's that will allow unlimitted power. Marnie works hard to connect with her ancestor to find a way to outwit those around her and save Halloweentown once again from a power hungry force that is out to control Halloweentown. This film is full of twists and turns, magic, Dylan turning into a dog, and even a little bit of young love for Marnie. My only complaint is that Marnie is not played by the same actress in the previous movies. Though, I think this actress did a superb job, it just throws it off a teeny tiny bit when the viewers have been watching Marnie growing into who she is from the first movie. Even so, it is still 5 stars, so I wouldn't let that put you off from watching such a great family friendly movie!",1382486400,2,925,4.479289940828402

It was still a dissapointment that Kimberly Brown didn't star as the main character Marnie,but Sara Paxton did a pretty decent job. It was also a let down that Aggie only had a few apperances throughout the movie. She's the one who made the series excellent! I mean after all if it wasn't for her coming home to visit in the first movie then Marnie never would have known she was a witch and she would have lost her powers. Now the movie did have a good plot and Marnie got to go back in time and see her grandma when she was young which amazingly she looked identical to her. I absolutely give this movie 5 stars even though their were a few things I didn't agree with.",1191628800,2,719,4.294117647058823
2850091,5,B000QXDG4S,"I love this movie!! Even though it's not the original Marnie, the rest of the cast makes for a wonderful story line.  I wish there could be more Halloweentown sequals!! I believe they left an opening at the end of this one.. so you never know!!",1191542400,,244,4.304347826086956

2850093,3,B000QXDG4S,"I and my daughter are a huge fan of the ""Halloweentown"" movies. We were both disappointed about the fact that Kimberly J. Brown didn't reprise her role as Marnie Piper. Sara Paxton is okay, but she had some big shoes to fill in my opinion since Kimberley did such a great job in the previous 3 movies. If you have seen the first 3 and not this one, I would advise you to check it out on Disney channel first before buying it.",1190505600,14,425,4.132530120481928

8197987,3,B000QXDG4S,"The villains plot in this movie is so stupid, it's equivalent to holding someone at knife point, then giving them a gun and saying ""Go shoot those people over there!"" The best outcome they could have possibly hoped for was to get arrested.",1526083200,,239,4.5813953488372094

8197989,5,B000QXDG4S,To anyone that says this movie stinks I loved it and watched it a day after it came out in 2006 I was at my grandparents house the night it released so I had to record the movie the day before and when I got back home I was so mega excited to watch this and loved it hopefully people will give this movie another chance. (Btw didn't know what imdb was back in 06 when I was 9 so only recently learned they switched the actress),1525132800,,427,3.9195402298850577

8197991,2,B000QXDG4S,Great story line but does not have the Halloweentown feel with out the original Marni. So sad! Sara Paxton has her own way of playing Marni- more sweet and 'rule follower'. Not as sassy and smart as the original.,1523923200,,212,4.461538461538462
