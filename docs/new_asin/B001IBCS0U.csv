It came wraped in plastic it should have been in a box to protect it from dents....when i open it the two dvd were loose and not in a case so it can easily get scratch. The only thing it has to ""hold it down"" it a flimsy cardboard with slots so the dvd can stand up...bad idea they should have place it in a paper case atleast and then.put it.in those slots, they need to re-evaluate themselfs and have better service.",1363651200,,484,4.105263157894737
