875707,5,6304253249,"When I looked over the video box and saw the fine cast, I rented this movie expecting some enjoyable but fluffy entertainment. However, this sleeper turned out to be a true masterpiece, easily making my list of all-time best. Within the first few minutes, Robert Duvall gives us a study in fine acting when he confronts his father with the mother's letter about their long-buried family secret. And how many people would recognize the authentic Southern slang when James Earl Jones declares, ""I ain't studyin' him!""

The only flaw I can find in this picture is the jarring music that inappropriately breaks the mood to introduce the final credits. But that's the only one, a millionth of a percent. I will snap up the DVD now that it is available.

Good story, great cast, engrossing from beginning to end. So why didn't this movie receive more attention? Was it because it isn't the kind that generates huge box office receipts? Was it moviedom politics? Or did the reconciliation between brothers who grew up on different sides of the color line make the p.c. types, the ones for whom injustice and victimhood are the only valid racial topics, uncomfortable?",1051228800,36,1160,4.853535353535354
875708,5,6304253249,"I have to admit when I sat down to watch this movie I wasn't expecting much.  After all so much has been written about crossing the color line in the USA and none of it has hit home for me, it seems that writers and film producers are afraid to tell the truth and either avoid the subject altogether or gloss it over in order to make it more palatable.  However in ""A Family Thing"" there is no attempt to avoid the truth or gloss over the details and a story is told from the point of view of a man who one day finds out that his whole life has been built on lies. Earl Pilcher, played superbly by Robert Duvall is a white man living a white Southern life but with the death of his mother he finds that his family history is not what he thought it was.  Armed with this knowledge he goes looking for his half-brother, Ray, played to perfection by the magnificent James Earl Jones, a man who has striven to bury the past, which includes his white half-brother.  But Earl isn't Ray's brother for nothing and he proceeds to bulldoze his way into Ray's life and that of his bewildered family. Only the indomitable Aunt T, Irma P Hall at her crusty best is not fazed by Earl's appearance.  She knows who Earl is the moment she meets him, and she's as blind as a bat to boot but filled with good Black Southern wisdom that has held her in good stead since the day her sister died not long after giving birth to Earl.  This is a deliciously heart warming film with some genuinely moving and funning moments.  I laughed and cried myself silly at Ray's attempt to keep Earl's identity secret from his Aunt, and Earl's shock when he goes to the supermarket with his Aunt and she tells the store owner that Earl is her nephew, and the store owner's expression because Earl is whiter than white.  It's not all hearts and roses though, there are tough words spoken and violence takes place but the story glides steadily towards its gentle climax.  With Ray's son grudgingly accepting Earl as his Uncle, and Ray himself coming to terms with a tragic past, the story ends with both men visiting their mother's grave and accepting each other for what and who they are.  This is a brilliant film that somehow manages to convey a sense of America's colorful past that has been hidden in the shadows of history far too long.  Two of the best moments in the film are the birth of Earl and how Aunt T eventually reconciles the embittered and angry brothers.  This film might not be everyone's cup of tea but as yet in this genre I have yet to come across another film of such good quality.  Billy Bob Thornton certainly knows how to direct films of merit.",1003622400,52,2634,4.340122199592668

875981,4,6304253249,"As always, Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones gave outstanding performances, and there is an excellent moral to this story, but it's a little slow moving for younger people to enjoy. The film is brutally honest about the ingrained prejudice between races, but that's what we all need -- brutal honesty.  The DVD was overpriced, and I would not have paid that much had Duvall and Jones not been the stars in this movie. Actually, the actress who played ""Aunt Tee"" stole the show!

It is filled with tension, new insights and a good settlement into reality. It is gentle and very real. I enjoy it a good deal.
There was a line in the original that was taken out of the disk: ""those people living up there. Where are their families?"" It was something that northerners do not see about the south: it's a strong family area, where anyone in the family will automatically make enormous sacrifices for any other family member. Generally, this is not so in the north.

It does have some bad language and some prejudice in it but to be true to the trueness of the era you would have to have it that way. So have an open mind to how it used to be and get the real life out of it. My husband and I comment on it almost daily and use some of the saying daily. Then we say ""Well it's ""A family thing tonite again"". We know the words to it and feel that we could act out the movie ourselves. The actors in it are the best ever in acting.

876066,5,6304253249,"Watch this movie and you'll probably find that, yes, you are.

You've read the other's reviews, so you won't need another synopsis here.  But let me say, for me, this is exactly the kind of story I love.  It is a story of disparate cultures coliding, picking up the wreckage, finding common ground against the odds, and synthesizing a new path to wholeness.  Its a story of finding one's family.  This feel-good movie is not trite.  It is a beautifully written, beautifully crafted film.  And what no one else here has mentioned is that a great part of the heart and romance of this flick comes from its soundtrack.  Howard Levy's harp (that's ""harmonica"" to us Miracle Whip types) conveys us from scene to scene, emotion to emotion with a deliciousness that lingers like a perfect meal; like a perfect summer evening with one's closest and oldest friends.  Every wonderful quality that has been mentioned in these reviews would be somewhat diminished without the musical fabric on which this tapestry is sewn.  Big kudos to Howard Levy (Chicago native, coincidentally) and Charles Gross for their vital, integral contribution.  I give the movie 5 stars simply because it satisfies again and again and again.",1359763200,,1208,4.901477832512315
876067,5,6304253249,How can you go wrong with Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones??  They really make the charaters beliveable.  my favorite kind of movie: funny and a tear jerker at the same time,1356566400,,175,4.4375
876068,5,6304253249,"This is a great movie! Hence, the 5 star review. I won't be buying a copy though, as even a used copy is upwards of $35. That's just stupid.",1344643200,,140,3.8620689655172415
876129,4,6304253249,"Well, it's a little strange to have Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones playing brothers -- OK, half brothers -- but it works.

Earl Pilcher (Robert Duvall) gets a letter from his mother a few days after she died, which she had given to the preacher to give to him. This is in a small town in Arkansas, where he runs an equipment rental shop. She reveals in the letter that she was not his birth mother, but that his real mother had been a black woman who worked for her family and was her good friend. His father really was his father, but had never said anything about it all those years (Something like 60 years). The letter said that his older brother's name was Raymond Lee Murdock, and he lived in Chicago. Last she had heard, he was a policeman.

Earl reads the letter to his father, who refuses to say anything at all about it. Doesn't say it's true; doesn't deny it. Earl decides to go see Ray, mostly because the letter had asked him to. Raymond Lee Murdock is played by James Earl Jones, whom I have loved for a long, long time. (Even as a fat old man, he's magnificent.)

Earl also meets his Aunt T., who is blind, and his nephew Virgil, who is hostile. I won't say more than the story has a happy ending, but you better have a box of tissues handy for the scene where Aunt T. tells Earl and Ray about the day Earl was born.",1336694400,3,1335,4.186770428015564
876130,5,6304253249,"The powerful performances of both James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall make this such an incredible and special movie that I just have to re-visit often. Black is black, white is white, right? Well, this story says that what we think about ourselves, our families, might just need to stretch a little bit further and even past our comfort zone. Two little boys, separated at birth, separated by race, find themselves thrown back together, in the fall of their lives, by the dying wish of a loving mom. Life can appear one way, and then show us we are not done learning, stretching, becoming the people we are meant to be. Strangers in all ways, become the family they were destined to be, and the journey is so worth a visit. AuntT is a character that will make you laugh, will stick with you for a very long time. Her eyes are blind, but also her love is blind to the difference that seem so clear to others. Family IS family, and that's all there is to it.  Watching brothers become brothers again is a mighty nice and funny experience, yes it is!",1333670400,5,1047,4.424870466321243
876131,4,6304253249,"I had never heard of this film before now, but because I like the actors involved I decided to give it a look. Duvall and Jones have good chemistry in this interesting and heartwarming film. In fact the entire cast make this predictable story a must see buried treasure.

The story of a man who finds out his mother isn't the woman who raised him is thought provoking and thankfully the ""fish out of water"" trappings are kept to a bare minimum. The actors really make this film soar and make everything seem believable even though the serious subject matter is handled lightly. I can not recommend this film enough for those of you who like to see great actors doing what they do best.",1311465600,4,685,4.48
876132,5,6304253249,"Like other reviewers here, I can't understand why this film got so little in the way of awards and attention.  I stumbled across it on cable and started watching it while multi-tasking.  Very quickly, I was completely absorbed and gave it my undivided attention.

My father grew up in the Deep South, and I visited there many times.  I ended up living there myself for a few years as an adult. I found the portrayal of the South in the film to be very familiar; it brought back lots of memories, both good and not-so-good. I watched Dad and most of his family shed their racial prejudice over the course of their lives.  Most of my Southern relatives lived well into their 80's and 90's, and it was inspiring over the years to hear them speak about segregation as being wrong.  That was an ""about face"" attitude change that I never dreamed I'd see.

Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones were excellent in their roles as usual.  Irma P. Hall was completely convincing as Aunt T. Seems to me that the three of them deserved Oscar nominations, at least.

I found A FAMILY THING to be heart-warming, touching, uplifting and wonderfully entertaining. It's one of my favorite films.",1302912000,4,1174,4.605769230769231

That said, there isn't a wasted performance, line, scene,... in the entire movie, just a steady paced Southern Tale of Reconciliation.

Others here give the bigger nod to the Aunt, mine is reserved for Mr. Steady (Duvall), if you want to see pure genius in ONE scene, find the one when he takes the letter and reads it to his (back sliddin) Daddy.

The emotion he emits in that scene is simply compelling.  It's a movie for grownups, for I don't see a youngin being able to sit through a Movie with no (REAL) violence, bombs, tight skirts, short-shorts, fake boobs/foreheads/eyebrows,...Two other good scenes:  Duvall and his older (black) nephew, telling him how he found out ""Life Ain't about you,..."" and the Blind Aunt telling them of Duvall's birth.

Robert Duval is cast as Earl Pitcher Jr, a 60 year old auto body shop owner in Arkansas.  He's as southern as can be and the scene is set so well that we can almost feel the heat of the hot summer.  His mother is dying and he rushes home to her bedside.  A few days after the funeral, the minister comes to call.  He gives Earl a letter that his mother asked to be delivered after her death.  When he read the letter, his life changes forever.

The letter reveals that his mother is not really his birth mother.  His real mother is an African American servant girl who was impregnated by his father.  The baby was born perfectly white and the real mother died in childbirth.  And so the white women raised the baby as her own.  This has been a secret all these years.

In the letter, his mother reveals that the African American woman had an older child who was thought to now be a policeman in Chicago.  She urges Earl to try to connect with his brother.  And so, he drives his pickup truck to Chicago in order to find his black brother.  That's quite a setup for a plot.

James Earl Jones is cast as his brother.  And Irma P. Hall is cast as Auntie T, who is in her eighties and remembers everything.  Oh, and one more thing.  Auntie T is blind.

The two men meet and clearly don't like each other.  And then, as Earl is leaving Chicago, his truck is carjacked and he is slightly injured.  He winds up staying in James Earl Jones' house for a few days.  Naturally there are complications.  And this is also where the plot becomes a little predictable.  There's an upbeat ending too, of course.

No matter though.  The acting and concept were so good that I just couldn't stop watching.  And I found myself thinking about the situation long after the film ended.  Therefore, I cannot help but recommend this film.",1104278400,21,1985,4.3269754768392374

With two of the greatest actors  of American cinema and  a brilliant cast of supporting actors plus a wonderful script how could it be otherwise. I cannot recommend this movie any higher. It deserves 10 stars. Earl's search for his half brother is a search for who we are as Americans. This movie should be required viewing for all of us.",1486857600,,375,4.582089552238806
