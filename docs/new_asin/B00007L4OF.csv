1819491,4,B00007L4OF,"This is a fairly good reflection of William Manchester's ""Alone,"" the second (and, unfortunately, final) volume of his Churchill bio series.  Winston's daily life was represented fairly well -- rising late, sleeping blindfolded, traipsing around in his robe, being attended by servants, throwing little fits over personal details.  I would have liked to have seen more information surrounding the meals hosted (or rather, conducted) at Chartwell, when guests would dine lavishly through the evening and listen to Churchill opine or, sometimes, debate and discuss.  These exercises, anointed with alcohol to lesser or sometimes greater degree, fueled Winson's all-night writing sessions that ensued after guests departed.
Additional portrayal of those writing habits also would have been interesting.  At one point in the film, Winston railed that he was working 20 hours per day to keep the family afloat (he had no ability whatever for money management), but it was not clear that Winston's writing was bearing the brunt of that support, that the family lived from magazine article to newspaper editorial to book, scraping by.  Churchill accordingly had to write like a maniac, which gave rise to what most would consider maltreatment of servants (we do see him admonish his manservant at one point, ""But I am a GREAT man!"" -- which indeed did occur, and which indeed Churchill was).  It is obvious in the film that the servants don't take umbrage to this treatment, perhaps understanding that they are an integral part of a historically significant phenomenon and literary giant.
Additionally, more exposure to Winston's House of Commons speeches would have been interesting.  We did see (on just one occasion) that he carefully choreographed his chambers speeches (""pause for effect, look of doom"" etc), but we were not treated to very much of that oratory.  Finney did a grand job portraying it (including the intermittent, slight lisp).  Why was there not more?
Manchester's books were sometimes overly detailed; this film was sometimes overly sparse.  Together they build in the mind a fine portrait of a great man.",1049155200,7,2121,5.267062314540059

1819502,3,B00007L4OF,"The only problem with this movie is that it should have been twice as long. We follow the gathering storm only to have history abruptly truncated just as it builds. Completely missing is Chamberlains delusional peace in our time bargain with Hitler, the surrender of the Sudetenland and intensification of the storm as the policy of appeasement backfires. Did the film makers run out of budget?

Albert Finney gives a superlative, complex performance as Churchill. We see his humanity as well as his faults; his immense courage in facing unpleasant truths that others were unwilling to see as well his imperialistic prejudices. His marriage with Clementine has the ring of truth about it; there are tensions that strain it almost to the breaking point but their underlying bond of love always prevails.

The film flows along with rhythm and integrityand then careens to a dead halt in the last ten minutes. This movie would have merited a glowing, five-star review had it not cut history short and cheated the viewer in the bargain.",1515715200,,1032,4.959537572254336

1819512,5,B00007L4OF,"The story begins with Churchill's passionate, disgusting, and absurd defense of the British colonization of India -- speaking as if from the top of Mount Olympus in front of something less than a packed House of Commons.  India -- was he kidding?  Today, India is more powerful than England!  This is excellent film-making, reminding or informing us of Churchill's grievous flaws, to put his greatness into perspective.  From there, the story moves through not much more than a high school history lesson of the events between the World Wars, but a superlative character study driven by the staggering dramatic powers of Albert Finney as Winston and Vanessa Redgrave as Clementine Churchill.  Just watch Redgrave's virtuosity -- how she pauses to absorb the shock -- in the scene when the Olympian Egomaniac has the nerve to call Clementine 'selfish.'

Since we can get more in-depth history elsewhere,  after my picking my jaw up from the floor, I give this extraordinary character study -- and truly beautiful love story -- Five Speechless Stars!",1511308800,,1048,5.093567251461988

Why do these writers / producers  have to insert meaningless nonsense that does not contribute to the story but distracts.
Once the movie got rolling it was very good. It is amazing to learn of the cowardly pacifism that prevailed in Parliament. The naivet&eacute; was negligent and criminal. This was underscored in the discussion regarding the sale of Rolls Royce aircraft engines to the Germans.  ""Oh, they will only be used in commercial airplanes."" Winston Churchill was mocked and considered a warmonger. Despite ridicule and political backstabbing Churchill preserved. Amazing parallels: of the denial of the threat of Nazism compared to that of islam today.",1492819200,4,834,5.08029197080292

1819534,5,B00007L4OF,A real throwback to the time when filmmakers allowed the art to speak for itself and their personal agendas and that of their financing sources were subordinated to the goal of telling a story which the viewer becomes invested and is left feeling like they truly have been provided a little more understanding about the world then before they watched.,1491091200,,351,4.866666666666666

1819536,5,B00007L4OF,What an amazing man!  And what an amazing actor Albert Finney.  Churchill was a Cassandra before the second world war and people did not want to hear him.  He really was a man for that time.  His unflappable character and determination is brought to life wonderfully by Finney.

1819537,5,B00007L4OF,A moving show. Great acting!,1488412800,,28,4.8
1819538,5,B00007L4OF,"Video combines the personal - Churchill's family life (strained, turbulent, painful) with his political life (painful, turbulent, strained).

Well done.

Churchill shown to be suffering from almost suicidal depression (the black dog). Writing, painting, and preaching in the parliament distract him, motivate him to 'keep buggering on'. His deep connection to British history, his spiritual connection to his military ancestors (the duke of Marlborough), his love of the English countryside, his deep hatred of Hitler and Nazism, all clearly presented.

One subplot is his turbulent marriage. Clemmie travels to Asia for four months with group of freiends. Includes George Phillips - single, attractive, charming. Will she return? Does she love him? Having an affair? Churchill finally probes . . .

''Do you love him?''
She pensively respondes, ''He made me like him''.

Some explanation of the conflicting political opinions provides backdrop to Churchill's fight to rearm England and prepare for war. Trauma of WW1, less than a decade earlier, dominates the minds and hearts of both the populace and politicians.

Why so passive?

''Many feel guilty about the Versailles treaty. We destroyed the Germans self-esteem. It was just revenge!''.

Sadly true.

Churchill seen as warmonger preventing and destroying any possible peace with Hitler. On the other hand, some Englishmen appalled at the new anti-Jewish laws and the camps. Churchill will have none of it!

One touching scene is when his long time butler interrupts Churchill preparing a speech. Churchill rude, impatient, demanding. The butlers response - rude, disrespectful, disobedient. Obviously there is more than employer/employee relationship here. Some measure of affection and understanding on both sides.

Fascinating!

This film moves at a good pace. Many different aspects of Churchill's life are covered. No single theme dominates, no single feeling controls, but a continuing, developing suspense drives this drama. Concludes with Churchill's call to serve as first lord of the Admiralty.

Not just a good drama, but a outstanding documentary.

Excellent!

1819539,5,B00007L4OF,"A beautifully executed film at all levels, chronicling the troublesome years for Churchill and for England just preceding the onset of WWII. Churchill , brilliantly played by Albert Finley, reveals everything from his naked fanny, to his ""black dog"" melancholia, to his disagreeable feistiness and pomposity, to his loss of political prestige and wealth, to his clever wit and humor, to his fear of losing the affection of his adored Clemmie ( Vanessa Redgrave). His government scorns him, derides his claims of Germany's swelling rearmament and mocks its imminent threat to England. He shouts it all from the rooftops and through all sources and audiences available to him, and then some. And finally what he warns of becomes a grave reality. This is a smart, engaging piece of historical drama in which all filmmaking disciplines ignite. Highly recommend.",1487376000,2,857,5.217391304347826

basic story (things that are not so well known about Churchill) beautiful locations, etc. The only downside
is that it seems too simplified... more could have been done with the writing, to give more dimension to
the people portrayed. But as an ""un-demanding"" movie (for a Sunday afternoon?) it was fine. Fun to see

1819662,4,B00007L4OF,"Interesting portrayal of Churchill's pre-war days with insights into his frustration with his warnings about Germany being ignored and his inabiltiy to get fully back into public office.

One weakness in the movie is the complete ignorance of Churchill's predecessor Chamberlain's ""peace in our time"" blunder feeding Hitler's bullying and giving into his demands for the Sudatenland, etc just to gain a peace treaty that Hitler had zero intention of ever honoring.

That was a key supporting part of the story. Including it would have demonstrated how accurate Churchill was about Germany's ""gathering storm"" to which no one would listen. Until it was too late.",1481241600,3,661,5.285714285714286

He is ably supported and in some instances overlooked  by an unbelievably understanding group of people comprised of his  wife and family, secretary, and staff, all of whom from time to time, suffer under his  eccentric and peculiar nature !",1476662400,,439,5.069444444444445

This movie recreates persuasively the grounds for Churchill's success. Albert Finney makes a more than passable duplicate of the real Winston, and with Vanessa Redgrave's help, we are led to vicariously relive these special pre-WWII times.",1473724800,,531,5.567901234567901

It took very little suspension of disbelief to enjoy this movie. If you admire Churchill, you will eat this film with a spoon.

1819931,5,B00007L4OF,"Terrific biopic. I really like the trend of taking a moment in time from the life of someone famous instead of trying to cover an entire life in a two-hour movie. This is about the year or so prior to England announcing it is at war with Germany at the onset of World War II, and it shows how astute Churchill was and how much England wanted to hide its head in the proverbial sand. In a very tidy 90 minutes, it gets into Churchill's marriage, his relationship with the Prime Minister, and his standing (which wasn't good) before the war. Surprisingly moving and inspiring.

Winston Churchill was able to bring the information forward to the English people (with some significant help).  Albert Finney does fine job as the arrogant parliament speaker, Winston Churchill; but  the real star here is Vanessa Redgrave as Clementine Churchill. Thus the five stars. There are some inaccuracies in the timeline and supporting character portrayals but not enough to take away from the fascinating love story of Winston and Clemmie.

The film was sort of like a collection of highlights, all of which were pleasant to me because I'm a fan of Churchill--like looking at my favorite photographs. I'm not sure that the film has much impact on people who aren't familiar. I'm also reading another biography of FDR just now. And the moment of Brexit and the UK's future plays into it. So, if you like Churchill and know the bigger story either by living through it, studying it or just reading, then you may enjoy it and  the following Into the Storm. Casting was a little better in The Gathering Storm and I particularly liked Vanessa Redgrave as Clementine.

1820230,5,B00007L4OF,"The Gathering Storm is a superb made-for-TV movie from HBO that tells the story of Winston Churchills years in the wilderness (1932-1940), when Churchill was in severe disfavor with the leadership of his own party. He sat on the back benches of the House of Commons, with no political power, and had only a handful of friends and associates. Most of the film shows how Churchill struggled to be heard on the subject of German rearmament during those years, when practically no-one in isolationist Britain was willing to listen to him.

The Gathering Storm has a wonderful ensemble cast that includes Albert Finney as Churchill and Vanessa Redgrave as his wife, Clementine. One recurring theme in this film is the strain on the Churchills marriage due to Winstons being out of political favor. Finney and Redgrave have a wonderful on-screen chemistry in every scene in which they appear. Other notable stars in this film are Jim Broadbent, Derek Jacobi, Tom Wilkinson, Linus Roache, and Hugh Bonneville.

 Ive read several biographies of Winston Churchill, so I can readily attest to the remarkable degree of historical accuracy found in The Gathering Storm. Its obvious that director Richard Longcrain and co-writers Hugh Whitemore and Larry Ramin did their research carefully in producing this film.

I thoroughly enjoyed The Gathering Storm. Highly recommended.",1466812800,7,1363,5.210045662100456

1820396,5,B00007L4OF,Albert Finney is one of my favorites. He can actually make dialogue sound like spontaneous conversation. The only other actor i've found with that kind of ability would be Ted Danson. These two guys and Brando are really masters of their craft.,1465257600,,244,4.833333333333333

In addition to portraying the nature of the turmoil that the world war swept inside the politics and society of England, the movie pays a very convincing attention to depicting who Winston Churchill was as a person. One of the achievements of the movie is the easy acceptance of a contradiction about Churchill by those who watch the two series: that  Winston Churchill was not a very pleasant character to be around and  not necessarily  a  politician with considerable political aptitude and humility. But, still, he was a ""great"" man and a leader!",1465257600,,623,5.019417475728155

1820500,5,B00007L4OF,"A love story and a tale of political redemption frame two engaging performances by Albert Finney and Vanessa Redgrave in The Gathering Storm, a detailed look at Winston Churchills determined political revival in the years prior to World War II. The hand of the BBC lays heavy on this talky production thats more Masterpiece Theater than HBOs usual edgy farewhich is all to the benefit of this fine movie, as one character after another enters Churchills world with words of either encouragement or caution. Espionage, seemingly a favorite subject of exec producers Ridley and Tony Scott, is only a peripheral part of Storm, mainly the manner in which covert information is passed along, yet it provides a sturdy vehicle for the wondrous Linus Roache as Foreign Office exec Ralph Wigram, who finds himself in a bit of a pickle despite his anti-Hitler stance.

Physically, Finney makes for a great Churchill, and the mannerisms, not to mention the deep, authoritative tone in his voice, all suggest tremendous character study on Finneys part. Hugh Whitemores script captures Britains future prime minister as he is reconstructing himself from has-been blowhard concerned with Gandhi to the man who foresaw the Nazi threat. Churchill is seen formulating speeches, working on his cadence, writing articles and editing himself extensively, and sticking to his guns after taking unpopular stances; he does these tasks anywhere, from the bathtub to bars to the grounds around his mansion where he paints landscapes.

Gathering assiduously tiptoes through Brit history of the mid-1930s without mentioning trouble among the royals or Neville Chamberlains attempts to talk Hitler out of storming Czechoslovakia or Poland. Churchills vision of preparedness was translated as war-mongering, and indeed, nothing brings him greater political joy than the message, delivered at pics end, Winston is back! Pic grants Churchill considerable humanity: His love for England, shot beautifully by Peter Hannan, and wife Clemmie (played beguilingly by Redgrave) are the forces that guide him, not the desire to plant the Union Jack in foreign territories.

Telepic covers the years 1934-39, and at the outset, Churchill is a staunch yet outmoded imperialist. England is lost in a pacifist dream, he says early on, depressed by his lack of power, near-bankruptcy and, on the political front, the rising support for Adolf Hitler. Churchill writes opinion pieces for various newspapers and makes political speeches that initially are heckled by the small groups in attendance. As time passes, his speeches are heard by an increasingly larger and accepting audience.

The shift of concern to Hitlers growing power and the mobilization of workers gains Churchill the support and friendship of Wigram, who uses his Foreign Office access to get his hands on secret information. Wigrams involvement stems from his own plight  Churchill has convinced him, quite rightly, that Hitlers racial cleansing would mean no life for Wigrams disabled 4-year-old son (Laurie Flexman). Eventually, the spy life is too difficult for this mild-mannered do-gooder to handle. His domestic bliss is threatened when Clemmie takes off for an adventure, leaving Churchill to re-establish himself on yet another front, the home.

Redgrave gives Finney a run for his money on the acting front. She is consistently dignified, and her two mood shifts  ones to anger, the other to reflection  are startlingly affecting. Redgrave inhabits a character removed from the history books and a thoroughly believable one at that; she is the embodiment of a support system that gets pushed to the hilt one time too many yet remains capable of recovery. When she returns from her trip and shares in her husbands triumph, her expression of joy is bountiful and all-giving, a distinct contrast to the cautious looks of love she proffers early in the film.

Key supporting players  Jim Broadbent, Tom Wilkinson, Derek Jacobi and Tom Hiddleston  provide an aristocratic air around Churchill, though none of the parts beyond Wigram is particularly meaty. Celia Imrie, as his assistant Mrs. P, and Ronnie Barker, who as David Inches commands the 18 staff members, take their roles of subservience and imbue them with a subtle, welcome touch of propriety.

Richard Loncraine directs Gathering Storm almost as a dance, steadily building the story, the interplay between Churchill and all who enter his world. Storm ends up playing gracefully due to his efforts, heavy as it is on historical data. Ending, for some, may appear too crass and feel-good, but it seems inevitable that Storm would end with something of a victory.

Hannans photography captures the exquisite English countryside and the vastness of Churchills country estate Chartwell, where much of the pic was shot. It supplies an intriguing dividing line between Churchill, who enjoyed a regal lifestyle, and the frugally minded Clemmie, who was never fond of the house. Conversely, shots in London come at the viewer from a wide range of angles, many of them used to enhance the compact conditions people in which lived and worked.

Howard Goodalls score is huge, like the sort of red wine one would drink with wild boar, and in places it threatens the pics somber tones. Moments in which the filmmakers have chosen to go with a backdrop of nothing but silence are quite moving.",1464307200,13,5368,5.219512195121951

R. Longrane has created an art  well deserved of Emmy award.

Our country now stands in a similar position, however instead of making it stronger, our politicians are playing a cutthroat game of power and deceit. Maybe it's time each one of them spent less time on waisting our precious, hard earned money and use one hour to watch this movie and learne from the greatest leader who ever lived.

Having previously been credited with one of the greatest military debacles of all time in the humiliating WWI Galipolli defeat by the primitive Turkish forces, Churchill was literally run out of Government service. Through these films we see the strength of character and tenacious spirit of the man as he ""keeps buggering on"" to first climb back to his former post as First Lord of the Admiralty in WWII, and then Prime Minister shortly thereafter.",1448064000,,581,4.938775510204081

Perfect for history buffs who also appreciate the telling with good art direction and set designs. Much of the movie filmed at Churchill's home Chartwell, was very authentic set design. Finney and Regrave's  performances are masterful. Absolutely perfect casting.

It gave me an appreciation of Churchill I had not previously understood. Especially coming on the heels of watching the mini series Jenny, about Lady Randolph, Churchill's mother.

1820737,3,B00007L4OF,So many things to pack into an hour and a half. Many of which were left out. The one that wasn't was the despair that England felt as Hitler walked across Europe. We have a lot to be grateful to England and Winston Churchill for. His voice was a voice in the wilderness that saw what Hitler was up to when all other voices wanted to do nothing but to gat along with him. Our FDR won his first two elections on leaving Europe alone. On appeasing Hitler by letting him know that the USA was not going to stand in his way. A louder voice on our side of the pond may have stopped him or at least slowed him down.,1441411200,8,608,3.9918032786885247

was.  However, as to those older people who recall WW2 or history junkies of any age, or people ,who are interested in this time period,, or film buffs of any age, watching The Gathering Storm is a treat. The actors are great, the direction is great, the music is great. And, one really believes very quickly in the movie that Albert Finney (who I will always remember as Scrooge) really is Winston Churchill.
The movie is also good because it does not try to portray Winston Churchill as a warm and fuzzy person who smoked cigars. He was a real person
who was despised by many, who was very difficult to work or live with and had a lot of emotional insecurities. He made may mistakes in his political calculations and his ethical choices are open to question. However, it is hard to believe that England could have survive WW2 without Winston being in charge.",1440806400,,1002,4.535911602209945

1820772,5,B00007L4OF,"I enjoyed this docu-drama which starred the venerable Albert Finney as Winston Churchill.  Finney did a fine job portraying Churchill; however, if one didn't have the back story, one may have gotten lost.

Finney's Churchill was a real curmudgeon, which I found quite charming.  I enjoyed this movie and wish it had continued on a bit as I would have loved to hear Finney intone ""I would say to the House, as I said to those who have joined this government: ""I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat. We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. We have before us many, many long months of struggle and of suffering. You ask, what is our policy? I can say: It is to wage war, by sea, land and air, with all our might and with all the strength that God can give us; to wage war against a monstrous tyranny, never surpassed in the dark, lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our policy. You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word: It is victory, victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however long and hard the road may be; for without victory, there is no survival.""

THAT would have been worth paying for!",1439510400,,1170,4.353211009174312

That probably sounds ridiculous, but it was my least favorite part of watching the film. Always sounded a little like spitting.

He whole heartedly embraced the character and brought him alive on the screen! Thoroughly enjoyable portrayal. I found Miss Redgrave to also lend a so necessary reflection of Churchill's wife, the formidable ""help mate"", as women of the era where expected to assume the role. She expanded the colorful canvas from within which the story was told, keeping the life of those who walked through one of the world's darkest times, very much palpable is it's realism.

The acting is extraordinary and as a result, the weight of history comes alive. At first, I wondered at the part of Churchill being played by Albert Finney. Albert Finney as WC? I just couldn't see it. Now, having just finished the movie, I can assure you that Mr. Finney embodies WC to the utmost. A superb portrayal.

Vanessa Redgrave is equally superb. As I have no real knowledge of the actual Clementine Churchill, I have nothing to balance Ms. Redgrave's portrayal against. Therefore, I can only attest to her acting skills, which are tremendous in this movie. The supporting cast includes such luminaries as Derek Jacobi and Tom Wilkinson, who are both flawless in their roles. The rest of the cast rises nicely to this heady level. You'll see some familiar faces in this supporting cast, I'm sure.

1820812,5,B00007L4OF,"Today Winston Churchill is a cultural icon. He was the greatest living Englishmen and he is extremely popular in the U.S. This first rate HBO film focuses on Churchill during the Wilderness years between the two world wars. Albert Finney is magnificent as Churchill and Vanessa Redgrave gives her standard excellent performance as Clementine Churchill. The film deals with Churchill out of power , a man looked down upon as an adventurer and reckless personality whose speeches in the early 1930's cause snickers. But Churchill recognizes the threat of Hitler and a militant Germany. With the help of political insiders Winston warns Britain of an arms gap with Germany. At the films end Churchill is out of the ""wilderness"" and back on his way to the Admiralty in the early days of WW Two. The Churchill in this movie can be petty and argumentative but he is also a dynamic leader who recognized the threat of fascism for what it was while others were frightened  and stunned into inaction by the devastation of the Great War. Part of the movie was also filmed on location at Chartwell Churchill' s incredible country estate which adds to the authenticity of this production. The free world owes much to this amazing but flawed leader who helped to free the planet  of one of the greatest threats to its existence.

1820826,4,B00007L4OF,"Churchill after serving in the government in the WWI era, fell into dislike and disfavor as a result of Gallipoli.  As a consequence, Churchill was out of the government for roughly 10 years.  Churchill still was a Member of Parliament throughout this exile, and his speeches regarding German military intentions were amazingly prophetic.  But even during the exile period, Churchill was able to use his contacts to help establish the size and nature of German military forces, and monitor a gigantic rearming of Germany that violated the provisions of the treaty ending WWI.

WWII started after British and French leaders gave Hitler an ultimatum and deadline to withdraw German forces from Poland.  While many people were shocked, and some even looked to appease Hitler to avoid another war.  Churchill never permitted himself to believe Hitler's words or treaties.  Continuing to appease Hitler only enticed Hitler to seek more more territory.

The Gathering Storm was the title of the first volume of Churchill's history of the second world war.  This HBO movie does an excellent job of compressing much history inside the confines of the television movies.  Albert Finney portrayed Churchill quite well, especially the personal ups and downs of the severe depression he suffered.  When early in the war Churchill was brought into the government as First Lord of the Admiralty he was elated.  It was not long before he became a Prime Minister.",1437436800,,1447,5.136752136752137

The production value, cast, locations and a nearly perfect script seem more appropriate for a theatrical picture but I'm just glad the film was made and is now available in high definition.

Finney and Jim Broadbent bring the pre-war era to life with their speech patterns and physical acting but the dialogue alone would likely hold this piece together. Such a stellar film for anyone remotely interested in how the Third Reich's true mission revealed itself and Churchill's heroic successes.",1435276800,,712,5.592592592592593

1820931,5,B00007L4OF,"This is an excellent portrayal of Churchill in the early 1930's in the years leading up to World War II.  Most of the bio's on Churchill deal with his excellent leadership during the war.  This movie really goes into the problems he was having both within himself as an ""older"" member of parliment and how the younger members made fun of him when he tried to warn them about Germany as well as the problems he had within his own family.  One always thinks of great leaders like Churchill as having no issues like ordinary people do in their lives.  This movie clearly shows that he dealt with issues many families deal with and in a very humanistic way.  The only thing is that I think the shipping cost was a bit high.  I ordered 5 DVD's and a book but because they all came from different vendors, I had to pay almost $4 shipping on each one.  Amazon should give you a break when you purchase several at the same time even though they are from different vendors.",1413417600,,964,4.351955307262569
1820932,5,B00007L4OF,"i recall seeing this years ago and I loved it. It's never replayed anywhere but I knew it had to be in my collection. Winston Churchill is a personal hero of mine since I read his 6 volumes on WW II and multiple biographies of him including William Manchester's trilogy. Finney portrays Churchill exactly as you expect, the English bulldog that would not back down even in the face of a war weary England that did not want to accept that Hitler and the Germans were rearming and that another WW was on the horizon. I wish a sequel was made for this since we need to see how Mr. Churchill took the English language and sent it to war against the Nazis.

Highly recommended and historically accurate.",1413417600,,698,4.453125

1820984,5,B00007L4OF,"The Gathering Storm is a movie about Sir Winston Churchill that takes place on the eve of World War II.  Albert Finney does an excellent job of playing Sir Winston as he is trying to warn Great Britain about the growing menace of NAZI Germany and Adolf Hitler.  Vanessa Redgrave also does an excellent job as Churchill's wife Clementine.  You see Finney as Churchill warning a skeptical Parliament that Hitler is violating the terms of the Versailles Treaty by re-arming the German military either outright or ""undercover"".  There are those who are loyal to Winston Churchill and give him the military intelligence covertly by getting the files from the Foreign Office.  In the movie you see Winston Churchill in all his moods.  He could be childish, profane, loud, egotistical, degrading, and very stubborn.  But on the other hand Churchill was humble, kind, reassuring, confident, and brave.  Albert Finney shows all these moods of Sir Winston very convincingly.  Clementine Churchill portrayed by Vanessa Redgrave was a loving and devoted wife, that thoroughly supported her husband, however she didn't tolerate his bad behavior either.  She was truly his rock of confidence when it mattered most.  THis movie has a great plot of the events that led up to World War II.  Colin Firth does a great acting job portraying a Parliament member who opposes Winston Chruchill.  As the movie goes on, you see that Parliament is starting to believe in Churchill's warning and along the way you see Churchill's rise in Parliament and finally as Prime Minister.  The locations and sets in the movie are outstanding, especially Churchill's country estate on the southwest English shore.
This is a companion to ""Into The Storm"" starring Brendan Gleeson as Winston Churchill during the war years and after World War II.  Both men od an outstanding job as Winstron Churchill and both movies are HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1378425600,2,1901,5.067524115755627

This movie has stuck in my mind and I find myself referring to it in conversation with others over dinner or drinks even though I have not watched it in months.

The threat to Christian civilization posed by Hitler then is very like the one posed by the Liberal Leftists today.
Sadly, the majority either ""support Hitler"" or ""don't care what he's doing"". Since the threat comes from within, it's almost impossible to defend against it. Students have been brainwashed to ""fight for the enemy"". Democrat politicians wage war on America and it's Constitution, and drain it of all the valuable resources that they can find just so THEY can have power and money.

Especially memorable is his relationship to his wife, Clementine, who has to face all of the bad, depressions, impending loss of fortune, unpleasant political battles, but doesn't particularly enjoy the occasional victories that make it all worth it to Winston.

Winston Churchill is believably portrayed by Albert Finney. Vanessa Redgrave characterizes Churchill's beloved wife Clementine as the devoted woman behind the great man. We watch as she faces her own struggles with elegance and grace. We have an important advantage Clementine didn't have. We know how the story turns out.

This is as much Clementine Churchill's story as it is Winston's, though her role is downplayed.  He being a renaissance man was a perfect match to her stoic stand-by-your man mentality.  Without Clemmie I shudder to think that Winston Churchill could ever have found the courage to stand by his principals and lead England in it's darkest hour.  Excellent movie! It could have been longer.",1332201600,,707,4.85

1821053,4,B00007L4OF,"The video ' The Gathering Storm ' staring Albert Finney, when compared to the film 'Into the Storm' from HBO(Gleeson)is hard to rate either one of them as better than the other?! They are both excellant films, with slightly different priorities. One is pesented to us from the British point of view, while the other is an American production.(HBO). I may be completely off base, in comparing these two great bio/movies,by useing the idea that nationality can produce an effect in them. Sir Churchill was not only a great man & respected by all Americans, he was also extremly loved by every man, woman & child who had a loved-one die during the bombing of London. The public took Winston into their hearts as their Savior. These same people, would later betray him & elect a new Prime Minister. They did not stand by him, when it mattered most to him. This hurt him badly, & during a session in parliment...it brought him to tears in front of all the other ministers. The general public of today,the off-spring those responsible, have a deep guilt/love for this iconic great man.  Both of these films are important, as well as beautiful to watch. They portray a world gone mad with arrogance & fear. They accuratly show the ugly side of mankind, when racism & hate rears it's head. They also show the great potential we have when our faith in a common-good prevails. King Arthur would be proud of us.",1307664000,3,1400,4.645161290322581
1821054,5,B00007L4OF,"""That's my Papa ....""

These were the words of Lady Soames (Churchills' youngest daughter), when she and her grandson saw the rushes of the scene with 'Clemmie' (Redgrave) and 'Churchill' (Finney), looking out over the view from their house.  These words were emoted with a tear in the eye.  I well believe it.

If you listen to the director and producer commentary that is one of the special features that's on this dvd, you hear the above factoid as well as other very interesting anecdotes and history making facts that are not too well known.  I loved the commentary as much as the film.

I read one reviewer say the film itself was boring.  Alas, life is boring for 90% of the time, not to mention frustrating.  This film covers both those energies from the point of view of Churchill during his 'wilderness years'.  It's not 'action-packed' because that's not the nature of the film and the time period it covers.  However, to me, it is ""action-packed"" in it's beautifully crafted portrayals of the tensions, conflict, love, hopes, fears and loyalties of all the actors and the characters they represent.  Every person is fleshed out with an authenticity that just makes you believe in the people they portray.  From 'Inches',to the maid, Ralph Wigram, even the little boy, 'Charlie' - superlative performances that come straight from the heart.  No 'phoning-it- in' here ladies and gentlemen.  Breathtaking.

I LOVE this film.  I love the pathos, I love Alberts rendition of the man with his irrascible but vunerable nature.  I really believed I was watching Churchill.  So many other portrayals have left me feeling I'm watching an actor - not the man.

Wonderful screenplay, wonderful chemistry, wonderful music, wonderful tempo to the film ..... simply ..... wonderful.

The sequel - Into the Storm - stinks.",1293926400,7,1818,4.9372937293729375
1821055,5,B00007L4OF,"There are plenty of well-written critical reviews of this film.  I wish to address only the lack of a rating for those parents and others who would like a little more info. in this area. The film would likely garner a -PG- rating for two incidents.

First: is Churchill's bare bum in the opening scenes.  It is not offensive, but it is fully present.  It is not presented in a lewd or crass way.

Second:  is the use of the ""F"" word roughly 2/3 of the way through.  Churchill and another man are walking down a beautiful country lane among the fall colored leaves.  Churchill recites a translation of a Russian (he thinks) poem in which the ""F"" word is part of one line.  It is said quickly and may possibly be missed if one is not paying attention.  Finney's thick Churchillian voice occasionally makes words hard to understand.

There are many scenes showing parts of Churchill in the bath and dressing.  He also ""makes water"" a few times but we are fortunate only to hear the evidence.  These are not offensive scenes, just very ""male"".

This is an excellent film.  It is hard to believe it is an HBO production instead of a full-on theatre release.  The quality of this production is very high.  The story portrays Churchill's inspirational tenacity, strong belief in his destiny, and love of country.  The film boasts a first rate cast and terrific props and costuming.  It is a treat simply to view the period furniture, cars, couture, and ordinary items that were found in medicine cabinets and kitchens during that time period.",1288656000,7,1535,4.639405204460966

1821078,4,B00007L4OF,"This was an engrossing biography and I thought the casting of Albert Finney with Vanessa Redgrave was inspired.  They play Winston and his wife.  If one is expecting Churchill to be a man who is a paragon and without vices, think again.  They are not, however, the usual things.  He is devoted to his wife so this is no womanizer.  However, he is beset by crippling depression periodically throughout his life and has to paint as a result.  He also can have a monumental ego, be offputting and offensive.  Balance this with the fact that he is totally right about Germany in World War II though, one of the few people who sees Hitler clearly.  Incredibly, others in the government want to try pacifying tactics with Hitler, like give him a country here or there and hope that satisfies him! Churchill knows that the only way to handle HItler is to defeat him.  You can't bargain with him.  Linus Roache does an excellent turn as someone in the government who helps Churchill at his crucial hour.  I enjoyed this more than the second part, INTO THE STORM, perhaps because the story isn't quite as well known.

1821097,5,B00007L4OF,"The HBO film opens with the camera under the bed of Churchill as he gets up stark naked from the rear and goes into the bathroom to relieve himself. With this very undignified beginning, we enter into the world of Winston Churchill in the days leading up to WWII. This is more than just about the political climate in England, it is the personal side of Churchill as well. It is about his life-long love relationship with his wife, Clementine as well as his life on his estate where he is struggling financially when the film opens and Clementine must step in to take over the finances to stay solvent. Much of the filming takes place on the actual estate which is amazing in itself. Of course, the focus of the film is the political world and Churchill's attempt to warn Great Britain and the world about the looming threat from Hitler and the Nazis. His is a lonely voice, at first. He had a true sense of destiny for his life and role in saving England. He had help, too, from inside the foreign affairs office, that would provide him confidential information about Hitler and his activities. It would be hard to imagine anyone playing Churchill better and more convincing than Finney. Redgrave is outstanding as well and is no minor character in his life or in the film. This is a film that deserves a much broader distribution than it has had. Really, a very brilliant picture of Churchill and the events leading up to WWII. You have to ask yourself, what would the world look like today without a Churchill? Warts (there are many) and all, this was an amazing human being.

1821098,4,B00007L4OF,"How many movies do you see about Winston Churchill? Not enough, that's for sure, at least here in the U.S.

Albert Finney plays the great British prime minister during the period before World War II and before he was in politics. Churchill was trying to warn his countrymen in the British Parliament of the dangers of Nazi Germany and most people weren't listening. (How ironic, with today's situation involving Islamic terrorists!)

A big part of this film also details the romance between Churchill and his wife ""Clementine"" (Vanessa Redgrave). It's not some syrupy piece. It shows Churchill's warts, too, meaning his ego and temper.

It's nicely filmed, a nice period piece and with just a handful of swear words. I was shocked, though, to hear one f-word, even if it was quoted from poetry. It seemed out of place in this TV film.

This is a bit slow but a pleasant film I enjoyed and recommend.",1234396800,,899,4.743589743589744
1821099,5,B00007L4OF,"Like other reviewers, I was a bit doubtful that the Albert Finny of Tom Jones and Two for the Road was going to be believable as Winston Churchill. He does an excellent job, as does Vanessa Redgrave as Clemmentine. The HBO movie covers the time of Churchill's ostracism by the Conservatives in Parliament. They even sponsor an attempt to replace him in the district he represents, an event only hinted at in the movie. The period is about 1936 when concerned civil servants, like Ralph Wigram, begin to secretly provide Churchill with government papers that are being ignored by the Prime MInister, Stanley Baldwin played well by veteran actor Derek Jacobi. The film skips over the period of Munich, no doubt for the sake of time. It ends when Churchill becomes First Lord of the Admiralty when war is declared. I have read Churchill's history and most of his books plus a dozen biographies by various people, including the excellent one by Roy Jenkins. This movie is true to them all and is a pleasure to watch.",1233878400,2,1012,4.72316384180791

1821102,5,B00007L4OF,"What a pleasure it is to watch actors who know what they're doing. Albert Finney and Vanessa Redgrave become Winston and Clementine Churchill in this understated film depicting the final years before the explosion that was WWII. No histrionics here.

Winston is experiencing a lull in his career, which bothers him deeply. What bothers him more is the blindness of his fellow MPs in the face of blatant German aggression. Clementine, meanwhile, wants to set out on an adventure of her own, after a lifetime spent supporting her husband's  political ambitions and rearing her children.

Finney becomes Churchill here. If his head and face were rounder, you'd swear it was Winnie himself. What makes The Gathering Storm more than a political piece is the story of his marriage. If this portrayal is accurate, the Churchill marriage was one of the great love matches of the century. Albert Finney is one of the 20th centuries underrated actors. I miss him.

History and biography, beautifully and intelligently presented. Sets, script, costumes, supporting cast (composed of leading men and women in their own right), direction, lighting - all superb.  Well worth watching.",1221177600,7,1170,5.169312169312169
1821103,5,B00007L4OF,"The Wall Street Journal stated: ""So satisfying, so superb, so rich on so many levels.""  I cannot agree more.  The Gathering Storm was a winner of three emmys (outstanding movie, lead actor (Albert Finney) and for writing).  On every level, it was exceptional.  The tension and the quality of the relationship between the Churchills was captured so well in the chemistry that was shown in the acting of Finney and Redgrave.  Some have said that Finney was more Churchill than Churchill.

What I loved about this film was the study of Winston as the family man, the husband, the father, the friend, the boss, the writer, the painter, the statesmen.  Churchill was all of these things but what struck me most about this work was that we discovered the man with his deep emotions, self doubts and moods.

Jim Broadbent was super as Desmond Morton who was a British military officer and government official. He played a role in organizing a response to appeasement of German under Hitler during the period prior to World War II. He with Ralph Wigram provided intelligence information about German re-armament to Winston Churchill when Churchill was out of power. Churchill became Prime Minister in 1940 and he made Morton his  Personal Assistant.  They had been extremely close friends.  Ralph Wigram was played by Linus Roche and he was a British official in the Foreign Office.  In the work of Churchill (Second World War) Churchill called him one of the greatest unsung heroes;  in fact he was much more than that; Wigram was tormented in his role of passing information to Churchill in order to gain the attention of Baldwin and others who had other appeasement and free trade agreements on their mind versus preparing England for what was to come unfortunately.

Stanley Baldwin was played aptly by Derek Jacobi and Wigram's superior Sir Robert Vansittart was played solidly by Tom Wilkerson.  We hear so much about the statesman and about his role of prime minister but we seldom get such a personal view of the man and his love of Chartwell and his great admiration by his staff and family.  All of this was captured on film with this work.

It is hard to believe that prior to World War II that so many in England had stuck their head in the sand.  Despite the rumors and stories about what was happening to the Jewish people and about  German sterilization plans etc., 90% of the English people still believed in international disarmament.  It could very well have been that families were so upset with the first world war that the young boys who were born during that great war were now old enough to fight in this one; it is certain that the people wanted to avoid a war at all costs and this was admirable in them and in their Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin.  But at the very least, thanks to quite a few brave men including Wigram; the awareness level was raised soon enough before it was too late.

There is a wonderful audio discussion with the producer and writer discussing various background aspects of some of the major scenes which was wonderful; but what I liked best was the superb acting performed by everyone and this last quote by Churchill about the performance of the English people could easily have been said about every contributor and actor in this great film.

""In our long History, We have never seen, A greater day than this.  Everyone, man or woman, has done their best.""

  - Winston Churchill 8 May 1945

1821137,4,B00007L4OF,"In this HBO drama you see the life of Winston Churchill, played wonderfully by Albert Finney just before the beginning of WWII.  He is not quite the towering figure that you have read about, but he does still have the amazing ego, this is the part of his life where he is facing bankruptcy, he is a laughing stock, and he battles what he and his family call ""the black dog"" (depression).  He is fighting the British government over their refusal to see the strength of Germany and the threat of Hitler.  But all this refocuses his life, gives him new energy and with his devoted wife Clemmie (Vanessa Redgrave) adds the spunk that was missing.

1821140,5,B00007L4OF,"The marvelous HBO production, ""The Gathering Storm,"" needs to be reconsidered especially now that the 14 hour Ken Burns overview of America's involvment in World War Two, ""The War"" has been shown to television viewers across our fruited plain.  What Mr. Burns and company have done for documentaries, HBO has done for docudramas - that is bring dramatic life to our history and make it relevant to today.  Many of the major events which occured in both Europe and the Pacific prior to the official outbreak of World War Two were largely ignored both in the United States and England.  While the Axis powers, (Germany, Japan and Italy,) embraced expansionist policies through much of the 1930s, the rest of the world countered with isolation and appeasement.  Drawn from the first volume of Sir Winston Churchill's now famous historic overview of the war years, the HBO production bearing the same name, ""The Gathering Storm"" tells the story of how a once powerful man, (Sir Winston - masterfully portrayed by the great Albert Finney,) finds his way back to leadership in order to help prepare his England, (and by example a fair amount of the rest of the world,) to withstand the imminent diaster we now know as the Second World War.  This beautifully produced film features a truely splendid cast to include Vanessa Redgrave, Jim Broadbent, Tom Wilkinson and Lena Headey.  Production values to include sets, costumes and scenery are especially handsome and ""The Gathering Storm"" comes at a very attractive DVD price.  After watching, perhaps you will consider joining me in encouraging HBO to start production on the next chapter in Mr. Churchill's six volume World War Two series, ""Their Finest Hour.""

From the ashes of his despair he rose again to perform a heroic act the world will never forget.

How fortunate we are to have this rendering of his life, done to perfection by the amazing Albert Finney! I'd like to give it extra stars just for his performance.",1189123200,,632,4.431034482758621
1821142,4,B00007L4OF,"The greatness of Churchill's leadership was that he could take any of the most adverse conditions he found himself in and turn that around and overcome these through intelligence, tenacity, and an ability to endure great hardship while never letting the sight of victory out of his mind.  Albert Finney has turned in a remarkable performance as this great leader and has shown from start to finish the unvarnished character, warts and all, of a man driven to protect his country at all costs.  The film predates WWII by showing Churchill during his worst time politcally as a member of parliament and his rise back to power. His struggles during this time prepare him to meet the challenge of war later.  The focus of the film is a mirror of our own time and seeks to warn us of dictators who show us diplomacy but have intentions of conquest and how we as free peoples must be ready to meet the challenge.  Finney's performance carries us through the different challenges of his political and personal life and show Churchill to be just such an enduring leader.  Facing almost certain political oblivion he fights back to regain his power within the government and protect his country.  Finney's performance is well crafted with many moments of Churchill at his best and at his not so best.  Specifically when he is debating the members of parliament on the coming German threat and more intimately when he is discussing his patriotism to his wife Clementine he is virtually indistinguishable.  His faults are displayed plainly and without heavy handedness so as to make the audience part of the room.  Notably his dictation to his secretary when he momentarily forgets she's there and starts to change his pants and then is embarressed as she reminds him of her presence.  His displays of depression which were real and Churchill's attempts to ward them off with painting and bricklaying. Altogether this is a very good film for anyone wishing to view the innerworkings of one of the greatest leaders of all time.  I highly recommend this and the biography by Churchill's official biographer Martin Gilbert  Churchill:A Life.",1187395200,2,2127,4.894150417827298

Jim Broadbent, Linus Roache, and Sir Derek Jacobi (as Churchill's nemesis Stanley Baldwin) offer solid support, but ultimately the film is elevated by the chemistry generated between its two evergreen stars.

1821156,5,B00007L4OF,"What can I say, I'm a big fan of Winston Churchill. There's not many persons on this planet who can admit their shortcomings and fears; look them in the eye, and make them work to their advantage. He was a walking ""how to"" manual on how to making shortcomings look a part of why one was able to be even moreso or better than originally declared in the age old question, ""What do you want to be when you grow up?""

This movie THE GATHERING STORM shows the homebody Winston and his relationship with the love of his life Clemetine and the way he was perceived in the eyes of each who knew and grew up around him during his days as a speaker of Parliment to his being assigned the Prime Ministership of Britian. Each child's perception is different as well as the perception of Winston's relationship with Clemmie as she was called. The chemistry between ol' ""Pug and Pussycat"" is something that can't be denied throughout the movie.

The movie shows Winston as human and vulnerable as anyone else living and breathing on his planet which quite possibly hadn't been shown that much for the wide and TV screens. You'll laugh, cheer, wonder, and shed a poignant tear for this unlikely man whose stances were not always embraced by the majority and not only stood by them but he knew how to take the vocalized gestures of doubt and disbelief and turn them into the very fire that inspired him to keep going. He took the arias of doubt and disbelief and he used them to fuel his drive to find out more documented and irrefuted sources of information that would either support their opinion AND how to work around it OR he would take those shards of information and he would make them realize, ""This is why I felt that this is the way we should be going on this and I have in my hands the proof that my way is the only way the way I feel we should be looking at this situation MY way is the only way to do so."" Then again, he doesn't really raise his voice. He doesn't call his fellow Members of Parliament dirty names nor does he cuss in any of his pleas and speeches. He speaks to them like persons and if he does point out a wrong coming from them, he just mentions the wrongdoing and NOT WHO DID IT.

The story about his relationship with his wife was more entertaining than the historical part due to Finney and Vanessa Redgrave as his wife. He fought depression and was bankrupt at that time. He had a huge ego when it came to his political life but deep inside felt he didn't deserve his wife. Both in his personal and professional life he was a difficult person to deal with.

The Gathering Storm won an Emmy for writing so maybe this movie just wasn't my cup of tea. Still, this movie wasn't quite a love story so I can't recommend this to fans of romance movies. It also wasn't centered around the events in England leading up to World War ll. So I can't recommend it to people who enjoy movies about history.

To see this great man in color up close within his last home (Chartwell) fully realized, warts and all,played by the likes of Albert Finney, is a special treat. Churchill once said, ""We're all worms in the end...but at least I'm a glow worm."" Yes, he was. This extraordinary diplomat,leader, writer, painter, should be studied and imitated until someone of his magnitude appears on the world stage again. This is the closest thing to Winston Churchill in the flesh that I have ever seen,  weaving myth,legend and fact into a glorious drama for those who want to see history brought alive. Vanessa Redgrave plays a wonderful ""Clemmie"" to the great one and their volatile relationship,like fire and ice, endures. I wanted to see more speechmaking, then I realized he left those to posterity, and allowed us to see the man as his family, servants and devoted followers did. There were also small touches to hint at his technical aptitude, his inventions, that people forget. This film only depicts this one valley in Churchill's life,yet there were others and you need not ask how he fared, for his life could be summed up by his own words,""Never give up!""",1148688000,4,1331,4.78695652173913
1821162,5,B00007L4OF,"""The Gathering Storm"" was a good bit better than what I expected.  I thought Robert Hardy's portrayal of Churchill in ""The Wilderness Years,"" some 20 years ago, could not be topped.  Albert Finney has proved me wrong as his is as good if not better.  Of course, the storyline is frustratingly similar.  The premise is that over 90% of the British public are opposed to war with Germany in the 1930's.  Many actually sympathize with the Germans for what was seen as unfair terms of the Versailles Treaty.

British political leaders pander to the mood of pacifism with one exception:  Winston Churchill.  Churchill stands alone in his concerns for the Nazi war machine as it is built up in the mid-30's.  British pacifists adopt a program of appeasing Hitler and his Nazi gangs with the inevitable result. Weakness invites agression as we've seen in our own time and soon the British face what they wanted to avoid most: World War II.

The story begs for a sequel and we hear one is now being formulated, to include Albert Finney as Churchill.  Let's hope the other main stars are brought back, as well.

How could Finney, famed for his portrayals of Scrooge and the father in BIG FISH, pull it off? Still I just had to watch. My concerns were quickly put to rest with the first appearance of Mr. Finney on screen as the venerable and legendary British hero. It was absolutely remarkable! Winston was there before me, alive again! The same was true of Vanessa Redgrave's portrayal of Winston's beloved wife, Clementine.

The movie is filled with facts about Churchill's activities leading up to war with Germany, his intelligence activities and his relationship with Clementine and his family. The film is absolutely a must have for all ""Churchillophiles.""

1821165,5,B00007L4OF,"THE GATHERING STORM is a compelling look at the lion in wilderness.  The lion, of course, is Winston Churchill (Albert Finney) and the wilderness is the political exclusion he endured circa 1938-39.  It was during those years that Germany rearmed at an alarming rate; England slept while Adolf Hitler plotted.  It was also a time that found Churchill gadflying from opposition to Indian independence to futilely warning England, and the world, about the newly dangerous Nazi Germany.

  Such is the political context TGS takes place in, but the movie devotes most of its 90-some minutes to domestic life at Chartwell, Churchill's country estate and the place he amassed and assessed the intelligence on Germany fed to him by a variety of sources, most notably Foreign Office official Ralph Wigram (Linus Roache).  Vanessa Redgrave plays Churchill's wife Clemmie, a woman who was as much a match for her famous husband as Redgrave is a match for the superb Finney.

  THE GATHERING STORM won't teach you all that much about English politics on the eve of World War II, or even that much about Churchill the politician.  As a character study of a complex politician it's simply brilliant, and strongly recommended.",1113523200,151,1212,5.040201005025126

It doesn't hurt that Vanessa Redgrave's in it too. The scene I enjoy most is Winston's plea to make up with his Clemmie after a spat!

1821196,4,B00007L4OF,"The years before Churchill became the  leader  of Britain through the WWII, were interesting for an observer. Practically ostracized by political class we see how a man can survive without doing what he liked the most: to command.

Churchill here is displayed in the most ordinary, plain and because of that touching way I have ever seen. His frustration for being far from power makes him a bitter man and unbereable to live with. Albert Finney plays a wonderful Churchill. And if the real one was not like Finney, he should have been.

While Baldwin was sure that anything would be better to avoid another war, Churchill was aware of the threating that Europe was facing. But his vision does not make him the hero of the film. Quite the contrary here he is shown as a man avid of power, who uses anything to regain it again. Here is Ralph Wigram (played by Linus Roache) who is the real hero of the film.

But apart from the political point of view there is a nice love story between Churchill and his wife lady Clementine. And no one like Vanessa Redgrave to play her. Her distinction, manners and warmth make that this couple will be perfectly  real. We see a human Churchill, and I think is very interesting to show how this man, hunger for power had not real one in his own family. Too focused in politics is his wife who must deal with the boring problems of everydays life.

It is a well made film. Perfectly settled and with great performances.",1106092800,11,1453,4.501901140684411

In Gathering Storm, Churchill is portayed magnificently by a portly Albert Finney as the egomaniacal, multi-talented genius that he truly was. The movie succeeds in providing telling glimpses into Churchill's private life with his wife Clementine (Vanessa Redgrave), his children, his household staff and friends as well as into his public dealings and persona.

Ms. Redgrave, and Mr. Finney are fantastic.  One can only imagine what went through the minds of Great Britain in pre-WW II.  He always believed he would be called upon to save Britain.  Linus Roache's role was small in this one.  If you are a fan of Linus Roache there is enough on him to keep your interest in the film as well.  This film was in two words, ""Quite Brilliant!""

Finney is superb as is the rest of the cast, and the production is, as expected, leaps and bounds above the made-for-BBC ""TWY.""

My only gripe is with the choices made in the script.  A surprising amount of time is dedicated to the tragic side story of Ralph Wigram that not nearly enough time is paid to the other historical figures and events.  I wish the film had been at least 2 hours, perhaps then the full story could have been fleshed out a bit more.

As it stands, Wintson shares the stage with Wigram in a rather brief sketch.  While tragic and perhaps a compelling story, Wigram was a marginal figure at best if you read the biographies.

Would that these actors and production could have been brought to ""TWY.""

I do appreciate the earthiness with which Churchill is presented.  I found the nudity and profanity to be very much ""in character"" for him.  I also felt this production did a better job of presenting exactly how much Winston had been marginalized during the Baldwin government, but again it is just hinted at -- not enough time is given.

Winnie is also more clearly humanized with more emotion, fear, insecurity and whimsy than in ""TWY,"" including his painting, so in that regard this production colourizes, as it were, the drabber portraits.

Although I knew that Winston smoked and drank a tad to excess (and his detractors will always bring this up, as though this contradicted his brilliance as a prime minister) what I didn't know was how devoted he was to his wife.  Though I knew how much he loved his country, I didn't know about how much ridicule and shame he was subject to in the early days of Germany's rise, when he and he alone in the British Government knew of the gathering storm that was the German war machine.

Not merely a commentary of the Churchill you typically know of, mind you, but a warts-and-all portrait of his personal life including his loving but sometimes strained marriage, his financial troubles, alcoholism, ennui, amateur painting, and most interestingly, his habit of absent-mindedly losing himself in rehearsing speeches while in the bathtub.

Of course we do get a good perspective of his political trajectory as well, strewn with ramblings on Germany and India. While he seemed a bit ahead of the curve on Germany, he was a tad out of depth on India (e.g., ""I wish to save Indians from Mr. Gandhi"").

The narrative seems to be deliberately relaxed, perhaps in order to be adequately informative in nature, but its thoughtfulness more than makes up for it. A very provocative undercurrent being that grudges are borne at national levels as well.

People who're not keen on the time bracket of possibly the most destructive war in the history may find all of it a bit tedious, but for diehard fans of diplomacy or wars this is a truly gripping film.",1096502400,5,1260,4.929245283018868

Ms. Redgrave does rise to the occasion as she, as we say, eats up the furniture when Finney accuses her of being selfish. She roars something to the effect that ""don't you dare call me selfish when I have lived with you for 26 years,"" These two fine actors are joined by a great supporting cast in this beautifully filmed movie. The action covers a brief time in Churchill's life when Hitler is rising to power in Germany. Churchill is having financial difficulties, is plagued by what he calls the ""black dog"" of depression and cannot convince the current prime minister that Hitler is an enormous threat to the security of England.

1821204,4,B00007L4OF,"It's interesting -- and understandable -- that the other customer reviewers focus at times on how great Churchill was. This movie, although it shows Churchill as a great man and conscious of that greatness, is about Churchill as a human being. We see how much his wife meant to him, and his animals, and his sense of place and animals and painting.
The movie is set before the war, while England slept (to borrow a phrase from JFK), when Churchill was trying to sound the alarm about the growing threat from a rearming Germany. It was fascinating, in that sense, to watch this movie as we await al Qaeda's next horrific move.
Leading up to World War II and Churchill's return to power, the movie's structure is a bit off-putting, in that the coming of war becomes a personal triumph, in dramatic terms, for Churchill. But then we watch with the full knowledge the Churchill's role in the war was one of the great personal and historic triumphs.
Finney is a great Churchill impersonator and calibrates his performance well, capturing the man's crankiness and depression and not just making him a show-off orator.

1821239,4,B00007L4OF,"Albert Finney does a remarkable thing starring in this film as Winston Churchill.  With no more than the proper wardrobe and a Romeo and Juliet cigar, he transforms himself into everyone's vision of the legendary stateman.  He well deserved the Emmy for best performance, and may well have won the Oscar had this been a theatrical release.  The entire cast is top-notch: I especially liked seeing Sir Derek Jacobi as Baldwin, and Vanessa Redgrave is a pleasure as usual.  In addition, the cinematography is fantastic - the production values rival any Hollywood theatrical release.  HBO is rightfully becoming the leader in drama.
The plot loosely follows the details of Churchill's political life (and that of Britain's) in the '30's.  I especially liked the portrayal early in the film of Churchill defending the crackdown on Gandhi and against Indian independence.  At that time, Churchill was a solution in search of a problem, and he basically lashed out at anything that altered the status quo or affected the Empire.  But when Hitler came to power, and Germany started re-arming, Churchill came to life.  He was the most vocal of Britain's appeasement critics and started arming himself for the battle he knew was coming.  This was Churchill at his best - a lone voice crying in the wilderness, but with a message that wouldn't go away and one that more and more people started listening to.  The film ends with the declaration of war in September '39 and Churchill's appointment to cabinet (as First Lord of the Admiralty).
However, the plot is incidental.  This film is mostly a portrait of Churchill the man.  We see him ranting in the House of Commons, lambasting his staff, tyranising his family, and coercing staff at the foreign office into giving him access to restricted material.  This is the Churchill everyone knows, and it's nothing new.  What this film adds is Churchill barking (literally - like a dog) at him wife, playing with his youngest daughter, and absentmindedly forgetting to wear clothes in the presence of his secretaries.  All of these character traits are well documented in his biographies, but are rarely seen on screen, and it's this fine performance of all aspects of Churchill that makes the film so worthwhile.
The film is prone to sentimentality.  It is prone to gloss over some events (like Chamberlain becoming PM).  However, I was pleasantly surprised by the details it does include - the average North American TV viewer may not follow every reference in the film, but it never drags down in such details and they never detract from the main purpose of the piece - it's portrayal of Churchill, the man.",1074211200,6,2647,4.923423423423423

1821241,5,B00007L4OF,"The ""Gathering Storm"" takes its title from the first book of Churchill's enormous and amazing history of the Second World War. It reports on the nationalism of Germany, the diabolical building of 1000s upon 1000s of tanks and planes under the scrutiny of the allies, the plans for the German purification of their race, and literally the war-like expansion to western and eastern Europe. At the time, 1932-34, half a dozen years before the start of the war, very few were speaking out against Germany. One of them was Churchill.
Certainly an interesting man and owner of extraordinary intelligence, you would want to put him next to Mother Teresa, Dr. King, and only a few others who shaped history and put us where we are today. If there were a dozen people who changed the world from 1900 to 2000, he would be one of them.
His words about freedom - 'we will fight them on the beaches, in the streets, we will never give up' and gratitude to the brave Spitfire pilots who stopped Hitler's expansion at the English Channel - 'never has so much been owed by so many to so few,' still haunt us today.
Yet he was a tyrant who ruled his home and family with as much self absorption and self centeredness as he did his political life.
This film shows all of it and could well be followed by the subsequent chapters in the dozen years that changed our lives. Albert Finney is great, Vanessa Redgrave equal to the task, and the others, Wilkenson, Jacobi, Broadbent, Roache et al. also brilliant.

The film does not whitewash Churchill's imperfections, including his sometime inability to work with colleagues, and the fact that living with Churchill was not always a bed of roses for his family.  Albert Finney absolutely absorbs the role of Churchill and ""becomes"" the man.  This is a fine film deriving from this superb performance by Finney.
Why only 4 stars?  Because the movie skips the period in which I was most interested--most of the year just prior to Hitler's invasion of Poland and the machinations and appeasement by Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain.  Perhaps it was felt that British viewers are so familiar with this period that there was no point in including it.  However, American viewers and I dare say those from most other countries would have benefited from and enjoyed seeing Churchill triumph over the utter failure of Chamberlain's policy of appeasement as Churchill assumed power in what had to be Britain's darkest days ever.  This was perhaps the most dramatic political event ever, and for this film to omit it in what purported to be a film about ""The Gathering Storm"" was in my opinion unforgivable, and this is why I deprive the film of that fifth star.

Albert Finney is a marvel, and demonstrates that he is truly one of the greatest actors alive. I was disappointed that Churchill's opposition to appeasement was given the flavor of opportunism, and the decision to omit Neville Chamberlain's premiership (we skip from Stanley Baldwin to the outbreak of war) is unforgiveable. (For a fuller and more accurate treatment of the period, get ""Winston Churchill: the Wilderness Years,"" a mini-series starring Robert Hardy, and available on DVD.)

This film revolves around the hard times Churchill faces when he loses his fortune in 1929 and is embrarrased daily in the Commons.  Yet he hits on the issue German rearmarment and will not leave it.  He sees before all of Englands appeasers the evil that is growing in Nazi Germany.
This won derful film will make you cry when you see Churchill staring from his balcony window declaring of his land ""I love it, I would die for it"" and later in the film looking into the darkness declares ""How short a distance in invading army would march from the coast to London, its only a matter of time"".  But we learn of the inner Churchill who beleived in 'Destiny' and never gave in to the Nazi threat.
Probably the one man on the continent who saw the Nazis for what they would become Churchill is my all time hero.  When all had been defeated, France lay in ruins, the british army defeated at Dunkirk, the Russians and Germans still allies, the Americans isolated he stood alone and declared that the Nazis would not pass.

1821245,4,B00007L4OF,"It's part of the Churchill legend that, after having served in high government posts in the first third of the 20th century, Winston was a has-been by the mid-1930s, ridiculed and avoided by fellow members of Parliament - caught in the political doldrums. THE GATHERING STORM depicts the period from 1934 to 1939. It's no exaggeration to say that Churchill owes the resurgence of his political career to Adolph Hitler and the Third Reich.
Albert Finney was an inspired choice in the title roll. We watch as Winston, despondent over his fall from influence, becomes the lone voice in the wilderness speaking out against the government's policy of appeasement of Nazi Germany. This is all the more remarkable because it was Churchill's own party, the Conservatives, which held power under Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin (Derek Jacobi), who, as pointedly put by Winston, was but an ""epileptic corpse"". However, this film does not slavishly idolize. We see Churchill for what he also was: inept at money handling, domineering, occasionally incredibly selfish, and perhaps too envious of the military accomplishments of his ancestor, the 1st Duke of Marlborough. And, as comic relief, the viewer is led to believe that Winston composed and rehearsed his greatest speeches in the loo, especially while in the bathtub.
THE GATHERING STORM is also a tribute to Clementine Churchill (Vanessa Redgrave), who scores major points for staying married to a difficult man. In one instance, after twenty-some years of selfless devotion to her marriage and family, Clementine defies her husband's self-centeredness and goes off on a Pacific jolly to chase Komodo Dragons, a large lizard. You go, girl!
This isn't a riveting drama by any means, but it's an extremely competent portrayal of the man and his times. For one already acquainted with Churchill's career, it offers nothing new. For one who knows nothing of Churchill or that period of Britain's history between the wars, it's perhaps a must-see. Much of it was filmed at Churchill's home of the time, Chartwell, now a National Trust property.
The very best thing about Finney's portrayal is his voice. I could close my eyes and easily imagine that it was Winston himself speaking. However, this aspect of the production also leads to its greatest failing, which is that not enough of Churchill's great oratory was heard. As I watched the ending credits roll, I thought how they needed a voice-over of Winston's greatest speech - the one that even now brings chills to me (a non-Brit), and which includes:
""Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves that if the British Empire and Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, This was their finest hour.""",1058054400,5,2737,5.057522123893805
1821246,5,B00007L4OF,"Okay, so for my money Winston Churchill was the greatest character of the last century.  Larger than life and who defied all and sundry when he thought he was right (which was practically always). Could this or any other movie live up to the memory of a legend.  The Gathering Storm managed very well, thanks in no short measure to the amazing performance by Albert Finney who not only looked and sounded like the great man but also captured the Bulldog Defiance which served the British people and indeed the world so well during World War II.  Vanessa Redgrave must also be acknowledged for her performance as the power behind the cigar.  In fact every actor in this movie turns in a stunning performance, including Tom Wilkenson who has long been one of my favorite undiscovered actors (discovered now of course).  I understand that a sequel is in the works and I hope this is true.  Because this surely is only the first course and what should be a sumptious feast of history, acting, writing and dircetion.  Just don't keep us waiting too long.",1049414400,36,1049,4.668478260869565
