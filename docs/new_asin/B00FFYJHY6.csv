8615442,1,B00FFYJHY6,"Gloriana is a masterpiece, but it has to be prepared with great care. It's the grandest of grand operas, but at it's core is the doomed love story between Queen Elizabeth I and the Earl of Essex, Robert Devereux. To succeed, it must be capable of fantastic pageantry and convincing intimacy. I'm not a traditionalist by any means, so don't mistake this for a plea for comfortable ""tradition"". I'm not usually a fan of reviews that only concern themselves with negative aspects of a production, but tragically, this is one of the two or three most inept performances I have ever seen. The set resembles some kind of municipal auditorium-turned-stage, complete with a a rectangular wooden platform with steps connected to the outside, right in the middle. From the parade of people at the beginning, this is either a ""suggestion"" of the premiere performance, or a later amateur one, being watched by the young Queen Elizabeth II, complete with entourage, including a fawning Benjamin Britten. One-dimensional, primary-colored flats and set pieces are lowered, raised, or pushed on and off. Some of them are so ill-chosen, your mouth is liable to fall open.  Essex paddling a boat on the river is just one among many. The costumes are awkward versions of Elizabethan clothing that might be for rent to non-professional Shakespeare performances. Few of the men look good in them. The women are a bit luckier, but not completely safe. The lights are bright, white, garish, and ugly, except when some ""effect"" is made by adding some color or dimming everything a bit.  But these ""effects"" are few and far between. For no particular reason that I can detect, we are shown the stage personnel going about their duties. People dressed in 50's style clothing are doing everything technical that a play or opera needs to proceed. The stagehands dutifully carry out the physical business, as the chorus master, child's chorus mistress, and the over-emotive, effeminate composer of the piece  (watching his beloved from the wings, wringing his hands, when not helping onstage during the scene changes) cue and encourage and ""conduct"", as befits this non-professional production we are supposedly watching. The offensive depiction of a love-sick Britten is particularly galling. All gay men in love are prancing sissies, don't you know? No matter that Britten was restrained, polite, courteous, and would have been in the pit conducting. This is some version in hell anyway.

All of this I could live with, barely, if the performers were singing and acting their parts with some kind of truth and knowledge and honest characterization. But they aren't. They aren't allowed to do so. The director has decided that everything be amateurish, as if he had contempt for the opera, maybe opera in general.  Every scene is excruciatingly horrible, stupid actions following stupid actions. The movement is straight from a talent-less high school play. After the first act, I began to wonder if the whole thing wasn't a parody. Watched in those terms, I began to laugh out loud at some of the goings-on. Poor Susan Bullock is so grotesquely histrionic, her costuming so extreme, she begins to resemble a drag queen. I began to pity her, even when I had to laugh. No one should be made to do half of what she is made to do. (I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt that most of them are not her ideas.)  But no one is spared embarrassment. The best of the singers cannot escape some cringe-worthy stage business, often accompanied by the most ridiculous facial expressions. Not even the chorus is spared.  In fact, at times, they are the most maligned. The only mildly interesting thing anyone does is young boys (who double as a children's chorus) enter in a line with giant cue cards, with a letter on each one. They hold them up, spelling out the name of the next change of place. They walk off. I wouldn't be surprised if it they were meant to represent all the boys Britten was supposedly obsessed with.

The singing itself is highly variable. Toby Spence makes a fine Earl of Essex...if you don't watch him. He has moments of great earnestness, and glaring arrogance, and sudden tenderness. The role suits his voice--which can be lovely--quite nicely. He's also smart enough to (mostly) avoid over-singing. Though alas, the lute song, ""Happy Were He"" is so plain, it goes for naught, ruining Britten's magnificent reprises of the music. Mark Stone, the enemy-turned-friend Lord Mountjoy, is also a fine vocal actor, with a beautiful sound. He also has the least egregious actions of the main characters. In fact, the male soloists, both large and small roles, are for the most part, well-chosen...to hear.  Kate Royal is a good Lady Rich, and could have been much more, but seems to be forbidden to do anything that hints at her conflicted character. When she arrogantly defies the Queen in the final scenes, her behavior makes no sense. Plus, her vibrato turns a bit harsh at the extremes of the role, partially the fault of the writing, admittedly. Patricia Bardon, the Countess of Essex, has more strain on her top, though her lower register is warm and round. The smaller role female soloists are best forgotten. Which leaves us with the singing of Susan Bullock. I wish her no ill-will, nor do I mean to vilify someone who is attempting something very difficult to pull-off.  She just isn't a world-class singer, no matter how many roles she sings in major houses. And this role requires nothing less. She has a weak, breathy lower register, a somewhat white-toned middle, and a horribly screechy top. I'm not exaggerating. She seems to be screaming some of the time. She has little vocal control up high, and no control of her vibrato. I began to pity her, which is surely not what is intended. And as mentioned above, her actions are embarrassing. Think I'm being unfair?  On the only studio audio recording, Josephine Barstow is rarely sweet-toned. And her voice can take on harshness. But she can sing everything in a musical, characterful way. And it can be beautiful. The scene in Act Three, where Essex breaks in to find Elizabeth without her wig and make-up, is a masterclass in singing as a character. Just from the way she uses her words and colors her voice, Barstow makes you hear the profound disappointment and heartbreak that the music needs. And Philip Langridge is a wonderful partner.  In the same scene in this production, once past the first few phrases, Bullock mostly over-sings, over-acts, and leaves it up to Spence to make up for the missing emotions. (But even there, the man is forced to do the most ridiculous actions while trying to make sense of the music.) Worst of all?  At the end, she is forced to sit on her throne while sticking a finger in her mouth to suggest,uh...senility?  Alzhemier's?  I do not believe that even Ms. Bullock's most avid fans can find much worth in this.

The final, grave disappointment is the unidiomatic conducting of Paul Daniel. I'm a fan of his work. I have several of his recordings and enjoy them. He is a talented musician. But he doesn't understand this music. He does what's printed, but JUST what's printed. Too much is stiff, rigid. The vocal lines need elasticity. The  music is meaningless without it. And it must go on and on without it. The worst conducting of a Britten opera I have heard from a major conductor.

The sound is awkward. To be able to hear soft passages with any kind of clarity, the volume must be turned up, which makes the loud music harsh when it arrives. Some of the blame for the edginess of the singing has to be blamed on the actual sound of the recording. I only have stereo.  Perhaps the surround sound makes up for this somewhat. If someone has shelled out the money for this, I hope so.

I am happy to say this is the only review I've felt deserved one star.  I debated the choice, but even some fine singing cannot make up for the rest enough to add a star. The video with Sarah Walker and Anthony Rolfe Johnson is still available, if you want a DVD.  It's a spare production, but the leads are good, and the production, as a whole, is effective. The Barstow movie is far too cut for my recommendation, though it is well-done. I recommend the audio recording with Josephine Barstow and Philip Langridge, conducted by the Britten master, Sir Charles Mackerras. The parts are all well taken, and the sound is warm and spacious. Please, do not waste your money on this.",1434672000,14,8457,4.774127310061601
