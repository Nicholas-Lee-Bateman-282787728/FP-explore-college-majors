The Al Pacino movie wasn't good.  The one with Liam Neeson was just okay.",1498348800,,156,4.571428571428571

8448116,5,B004YCKJEW,Bought this for The Crossing Guard.  All actors show up credibly in this emotional piece about more than one form of loss/grief.  David Morse is a favorite of mine who is not in enough films and stands out in this film .  I look forward to seeing the other two films.  Can't believe I missed them in the past.,1418428800,,309,4.186440677966102

8448120,5,B004YCKJEW,Three great movies with some of Hollywood's top actors. Very entertaining and lots of suspense. I watched this Miramax triple feature on a rainy day with my family and we all enjoyed it.,1352851200,,186,4.666666666666667
