8673335,5,B00MNS2PDC,"Delta Force 1&2 are good Chuck Norris films. Delta Force was released in 1986. The plot includes hijacking and has a bunch of stars, with best support from Lainie Kazan and Shelley Winters. I enjoyed seeing this in the theatre. Delta Force 2 was released in 1990. The plot involves Chuck taking out a drug cartel in South America. Richard Jaeckel provides best support. I saw this on television so the action was probably edited. Fans of Chuck Norris will like these the most.",1499126400,,476,4.678571428571429

8673338,4,B00MNS2PDC,"When Chuck Norris shows up to take on ruthless terrorists and cold blooded drug kingpins it's always a good day for America.  Delta Force 1 has a real theatrical G.I. Joe element to it that those of you who remember the cartoon will appreciate and enjoy.  Plenty of action yet the plot is still relevant even 29 years later unfortunately.  Delta Force 2 features Chuck Norris taking on an entire South American drug cartel.  Again, plenty of action, shootouts, explosions as well as hand to hand combat.  If you like the Delta Force movies you should also check out ""Invasion USA"" and Code of Silence"".",1441756800,4,602,4.695238095238095
