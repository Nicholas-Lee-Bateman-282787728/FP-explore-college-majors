8294695,5,B001DSGICW,"As a teen in the sixties I dragged a guy (his idea of music only pop)to a double bill of Bittersweet and Maytime.  He didn't think much of Bittersweet but fell hard for Maytime.  I was shocked.  And thru the years I've found Maytime has a universal quality  that makes it also appeal to people not into this genre.

Jeanette is willingly dominated by Barrymore managing her career (shades of Svengali), giving up her new, quite accidental love, Eddy.  Eddy gets a marvelous barroom song....""Fat Prima Donna.""  Then he keeps singing a fractured operatic medley (Caro Nome, Largo al Factotum, La Donna e Mobile, Lucia Sextet, Anvil Chorus, and the Tell overture) and won't stop until Jeanette, leaving in the carriage, agrees to come to lunch the next day.

After a wonderful maytime fete Jeanette explains why she's giving him up and they sing ""Will you Remember?""

My favorite part is the operatic version of Tchaikovsky's 5th symphony.  This sort of arrangement usually falls way short, like in the '44 Phantom.  But this time its fabulous.  Sung in French (Russians learned opera from the French so Russian operas usually have a French version) and the words are pretty understandable even just with my 2 years of high school French.  The 'opera' is about Catherine the Great executing Peter.  Pretty heavyweight singing.  And I much prefer it to the symphonic version.  But then, I'm an opera fanatic.

Our lovers meet again as Eddy is the only baritone available who can sing Petrov.  Barrymore is not amused when he  realizes he saw this man coming out of Jeanette's dressing room 7 years earlier.  I won't spoil the ending for you.

This is usually considered the best Eddy MacDonald musical.",1249171200,,1698,4.846689895470384
