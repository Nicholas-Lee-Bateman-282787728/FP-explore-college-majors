7901231,1,9078272104,The sunset reflecting off the water lines you in there of the strangest sounds that are irritating. This was not so good. The DVD of the coral Reef underwater pictures is fantastic,1494115200,,180,4.65625

7901233,5,9078272104,bought this for my nine-yr old daughter who gets afraid in the middle of the night. We wanted something soothing for her to sleep to and to keep her company and feelings of safety. thank you!,1472947200,,191,4.333333333333333
7901234,5,9078272104,I walk at least two miles a day on my treadmill. I set up a DVD player and small flat screen so I can watch different DVD's while walking. I enjoy the sights and sounds in this Nature DVD and I think you will too.,1457222400,,213,3.7555555555555555

7901236,5,9078272104,"This DVD is EXACTLY how it's described after the title - ""designed for Relax and Sleep Aid & Stress Relief"" While I wasn't looking for a sleep aid, I definitely wanted something that would relax and de-stress me. This DVD did that and more! The photography is wonderful and the variety of sights and sounds kept me glued to my TV. It is simply amazing. I love all peaceful nature videos and this is definitely among the best I've ever seen. I love the tranquility of the film - it just makes me feel good!",1422144000,,505,4.326315789473684
7901237,5,9078272104,"I really like this dvd.  First one I've bought from them and I will buy more.  This one is quite nice and you get a lot with it...a good, long 45 minute video plus another Relaxation section that's 4 separate 10 minute videos that loop (you can do a play all for another 40 minutes with these).  It's a nice balance and not the typical 3-minute video clip that just repeats over and over.  It's very peaceful and tranquil and the location is very nice.  Definitely worth getting to watch while relaxing with your coffee in the morning!  If you don't live on a peaceful lakefront with wildlife, this is a pretty nice video to own.",1418947200,,629,4.379310344827586
7901238,5,9078272104,"This dvd is relaxing and beautiful. It is darker in color than many of other Helsoot films; I find it moody in a wonderful, uplifting way. I own many dvds from this company and this one is one of the easiest to fall asleep to. It is not simply nature scenes, it borders on an art film with a distinctly sublime element. Many stars and thanks for helping me fall asleep! I hope this company keeps these dvds coming and expands the choices, especially of locations through out North America.",1393804800,2,489,4.444444444444445
7901239,5,9078272104,"I own several thousand dollars worth of relaxation videos and use them regularly.  However, World Nature Video are without a doubt some of the very best on the market.  I have been purchasing their products for several years and have been extremely pleased with every one of their videos.  I highly recommend any of their products.  High quality video and sound effects.",1383177600,,370,4.919354838709677
7901240,5,9078272104,"I am a collector of nature and relaxation DVDs, as I prefer to have these on as background when I read and write. I own one or more titles from just about every series ever released, but Isis Visuals has the largest selection of scenery and the most professionally produced titles of any series I've seen or experienced.

The Lagoon title from the Ambient Collection is a little deceiving in name, but delivers on relaxation.  It's really almost a pond, as it is set apart from the sea and is surrounded by various grasses.  I love this title because it is mostly nighttime scenes, and the sounds of the crickets are so soothing.  One scene is breathtaking, as the dusk captures the golden glow of the setting sun and the deep blue of the coming nigh then takes over the sky.  This is a title I reach for often before retiring for the night.

I own about 15 titles from this producer, and still have a long want list.  You can enjoy your favorite season year round, visually visit places you might never have an opportunity to encounter, and peek into parts of the world that we will never know.  If you are thinking about buying a title, you won't regret it.",1297555200,6,1159,4.433962264150943
