663731,4,6303482546,"My 4yr old daughter and 2 yr old son would watch this video over and over and over if I let them.  I also find some of the lines annoying, as mentioned by another reviewer.  But my kids don't seem to mind at all.  And it doesn't talk down to kids-no goofy adults or bad special effects.  Just trains, trains, trains.  I found it much more enjoyable for repeated viewing than the ""I Love Toy Trains"" series.",1026432000,3,406,4.220779220779221

7848650,5,6303482546,My son was absolutely thrilled. It is one of his favorite videos and no longer available to borrow at the local library. Thanks So much!,1301443200,,136,4.48
7848651,5,6303482546,"My 5 year-old son watched this video when he was two and ranked it as his favorite for almost two years (until age 4).  One video self destructed (bad VCR) and we purchased another.  My younger son, now age two, has just discovered the video and wants to watch nothing else!  The music is sweet and the child actors are pretty low-key.  It is old-fashioned fun and I don't mind letting my boys watch it.  I give it top rating.  Please, please release it on DVD!!!",1288915200,,463,4.325581395348837
7848652,4,6303482546,My 5yr old loves trains and loves this video. Only about 20min so great for a short diversion. I actually enjoy watching it too. Two children -- brother and sister -- take you to different trains and in them and through them. They are cute together and show some neat trains.,1231804800,,275,4.411764705882353
7848653,5,6303482546,"I bought this a few years ago in VHS for my boys when I ran across it at Marshall's - fully expecting they'd just watch it a few times and we'd pass it along to someone else.  It quickly became one of their favorites.  They are 6 and almost 10 now and I'm sure if I threw it in the VCR they'd sit and watch it.  In fact, I have a couple uncles who are train enthusiasts and they even got a kick out of watching it.

As another reviewer mentioned, the narrative is a little cheesy at times but the music is catchy (I catch myself humming along in the kitchen while the kids are watching in the family room) and there's lots of good footage of the trains themselves.  One of the cool things about it is it features a progression of trains from the smallest scale right up to an actual commuter train.  You can be pretty sure that if your child is into trains, they'll enjoy watching this again and again.",1195603200,,902,4.1257142857142854

7848655,5,6303482546,I have a 4 year old and a 2 year old.  They both love the DVD - Big Trains Little Trains.  My kids can watch it over and over again without getting tired of it.,1129334400,,160,3.5428571428571427
7848656,4,6303482546,"We originally borrowed *Big Trains, Little Trains* (VHS) from the library, along with the *I Love Toy Trains Vols. 1-3* DVD; *Choo Choo Trains: Close Up and Very Personal* (VHS); and the *Travel Adventures* DVD, which contains *There Goes a Train.* My 23 month-old son enjoyed *Big Trains, Little Trains* the most out of the bunch.  I just purchased this title on DVD.

Most of the footage seems to have been shot in the San Diego area, and includes trains from the LGB of America showroom, model railroad clubs and enthusiasts, museums, and mass transit. The variety of footage really holds my son's attention.

As previous reviews state, the dialogue can be rather annoying at times, but the 2 children in the video are engaging and enthusiastic. Carly, the little girl, comports herself very well as narrator.

The segment on the commuter railroad, near the end of the program, also has its cheesey moments when Connor drives away in the train.  Although the scene is portrayed in a cutesy manner, including a ""don't try this at home"" warning might have been apropos.  (A general disclaimer about the dangers of railroads and playing on tracks _is_ given at the end of the program.)

The soundtrack includes instrumentals, as well as songs with vocals, and both are unobtrusive and enjoyable (which makes a big difference for parental sanity, if your child wants to watch the  video again and again, day after day).

My son didn't care much for the *I Love Toy Trains* DVD, which seemed to have choppy editing (both audio and video) and cheesey sound effects. *There Goes a Train* didn't hold his interest, either, as there's a lot of narration; and the goofy narrator, Dave, got pretty annoying (to Mama) by the end of the program. The *Choo Choo Trains: Close Up and Very Personal* video was probably my son's next favorite after *Big Trains, Little Trains*, because it contained straight footage of steam and diesel trains--no narration, no music, no actors.

He's totally entranced by *Big Trains, Little Trains.* It's just right for his attention span and interest in trains. He loves his wooden Thomas the Tank Engine trains and his train books, but really isn't into the Thomas videos yet, so *Big Trains, Little Trains* was a great alternative.",1126224000,3,2255,4.87958115183246

The DVD is pretty much an exact transfer of the VHS version; both are 27 minutes in length.  The image and audio quality are both fairly good; certainly better than the VHS copy from the library.  The DVD has no menus, no chapters, no bonus features...just press ""Play""!

7848658,5,6303482546,"Child narrators in videos tend to get on my nerves pretty quickly, but the kids in this video are really pretty appealing, and I can tell that my son likes them too because he refers to the video as ""Carly-Connor"".  Yes, they do have a couple of silly lines, but all in all, the annoyance factor is pretty minimal, and I love how they interact with some of the train hobbyists.  It also does a nice job of bringing in a lot of variety without straying from the subject matter at hand - for example, we may see a petting zoo or a tractor being used to load coal into the tender car, but then we are right back to watching trains - overall a very well done video that does not feel overly ""slick"".",1041206400,5,695,4.140740740740741
