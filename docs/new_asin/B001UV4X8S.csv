3804380,4,B001UV4X8S,"Ronnie Barnhardt (Rogen) is a security guard in the local mall.  He has four subordinates: Dennis (Pena), the Yuen twins (Yuan and Yuan), and Charles (Plemons).  They all look up to him, and he runs things like it is the most important job that ever existed.  Ronnie himself has a thing for Brandi (Faris), who works in cosmetics, but she doesn't return his affections.  Nell (Wolfe), another mall employee likes him, but she is too plain for him to notice.  Then tow things happen to rock Ronnie's world: a flasher begins terrorizing customers and employees, and a string on robberies.  Despite the police becoming involved, Ronnie sees this as his problem, and takes things into his own hands.

""Observe and Report"" is a surprising film.  It is not your typical Seth Rogan comedy.  In fact, its darker undertones are reminiscent of Adam Sandler's ""Punch Drunk Love"".  This alone will be polarizing for people looking for something like ""Knocked Up"".  Rogan does well, stretching his acting chops as Ronnie, a seriously flawed individual.  There are a lot of laughs, but there is an awful amount of uncomfortable moments as well.  Director Jody Hill even manager to push the limits of male nudity to humorous and uncomfortable effect.  ""Observe and Report"" is a better movie than I initially thought walking out of the theater, but it is definitely not for everyone.  See at your own risk!",1241827200,5,1390,4.880341880341881
3804381,4,B001UV4X8S,"Ronny Barnhardt (Seth Rogen), the head of security for a large mall, takes his job very seriously, overseeing his troupe of three officers including Dennis (Michael Pena) and dealing with his alcoholic mom (Celia Weston). Ronny is bi-polar and seems frustrated that he can never use real guns in his quest for peace and safety at the mall. One day, a flasher begins to terrorize the female customers at the mall and chooses to flash his wares at Brandi (Anna Faris), one of the cosmetic counter girls at the department store. Brandi is the love of Ronny's life (if only Brandi actually knew this), so he immediately vows to find the culprit. When the flasher continues to strike and a burglar begins to target the mall, Detective Harrison (Ray Liotta) is called in to close the case. Ronny and Harrison immediately butt heads and Ronny becomes even more determined to solve both cases.

Written and directed by Jody Hill, ""Observe and Report"" is the second mall cop comedy to be released since January, but I have every feeling that this film is head and shoulders above the other.

There seems to be a new and burgeoning sub genre of comedy making its way to the multiplexes of America. The first significant example of this was ""Pineapple Express"" directed by David Gordon Green and starring Seth Rogen and James Franco. In this film, the laughs play side by side with real violence, violence that is the consequence of the actions of the characters. As we watch the stoners try to survive while being pursued by criminals and corrupt cops, we laugh and we flinch from the violence portrayed in the film. In addition to the violence, the characters and the story sort of meander, sort of stumble along. It is an interesting idea and Green pulls it off. In the new film ""Observe and Report"", director Jody Hill and stars Seth Rogen and Anna Faris have created a very strange universe populated with some laughs and some very strong violence.

These films are interesting because they are so different from most of the other comedies we have the opportunity to see. It's almost like these filmmakers have convinced studios to let them make Independent-like films under their studio banner, spending money on larger budgets with larger casts and more complicated shoots. In a way, they are almost elevating a story that most likely would have exclusively been the fodder of independent filmmakers.

Seth Rogen seems to delight in creating and playing strange characters. As in ""Pineapple Express"", Ronny is a very different type of comedy lead. He has bipolar disorder and seems to take his job very seriously, strutting through the mall, keeping his eyes open, lording what little authority he has over the patrons and employees who work there. He seems to have an ongoing feud with a man who runs one of the carts and calls him Saddam (Aziz Ansari, TV's ""Parks and Recreation""). He also meets a young woman who just started at the Cinnabon-esque stall at the food court. Nell (Collette Wolf) sits at the register; her healing leg propped up, ready and willing to smile at Ronny. This is Ronny's universe and he tries to exact control over it. When he hears that Brandi has been exposed to the flasher, he immediately runs to her side and vows to protect her.

Rogen makes Ronny seem vulnerable and egotistical, lost and driven, all of which fit the character's bipolar disorder. But Rogen brings the character an air of believability. I think we have all known people like Ronny. And in a way, that make him both sadder and funnier. We can identify with Ronny and we see what he is trying to accomplish, even if he has trouble succeeding in many ways.

I have to say Rogen has a certain ""every guy"" charm about him that has only made each of his films better.

Michael Pena plays Dennis, Ronny's second in command. Dennis is certainly not like any other character we have ever seen Pena (""Crash"") play. Dennis has a loose, greasy(?) Afro, wears sunglasses a lot and speaks with a strange lisp. He seems to be as in to his job as Ronny is and they make a good pair. Later, his character has some strange turns that I didn't completely buy.

Anna Faris plays Brandi, the cosmetic counter girl who has captured Ronny's eye. She seems oblivious to anything but the most superficial things around her and doesn't really seem to care about anything else. The character is funny, but we have seen Faris play this role before. Maybe too many times at this point., because she almost seems typecast in the role. She played basically the same type of person in ""Just Friends"" and the performance was a lot funnier.

Ray Liotta plays Ronny's arch enemy and it is amusing to watch Detective Harrison and Ronny circle each other like kids on an elementary school playground. They seem to take an instant dislike to one another because the Detective realizes Ronny will only get in his way and Ronny realizes this guy might actually solve the crimes that are afoot on his home turf, stealing his glory and threatening his job.

Celia Weston plays Ronny's mom, an unapologetic drunk and she certainly seems to dive into the role whole hog. She is one of the most uncompromising drunks I have ever seen in film.

Nell is a good compliment to Ronny and Collette Wolf brings a sweet quality to the role. You can tell Nell will never be anything other than a food court employee because she seems to enjoy it and doesn't seem to care about doing anything else. Which is fine. But she finds herself in a bad situation because she just got hired at this new place and then had to have surgery, so she sits at the register all day, with her leg propped onto the counter. Ronny seems to like her, and take an interest in her, but his interest in Brandi is more pressing and he can't let anything interrupt his quest for the object of his desire.

The film has a definite dated look, slightly flat and the images are a little grainy, like Hill is trying to evoke the type of films made in the Seventies. This, and the film's setting in a dated mall, gives the project a slightly retro look, making us believe it might have been made before the advent of high def. It works because it helps us think back to the grittier, more interesting films of the 70s, films that took chances with characters and story lines.

""Observe and Report"" is very good. It is not a comedy that will make you roll in the aisle, but it creates an interesting atmosphere for an oddball group of characters that will make you laugh and smile and flinch at the violence.",1241308800,4,6521,4.616048317515099
3804382,5,B001UV4X8S,"Just got back from seeing this movie. I didn't know anything about it before going in, but was so glad I saw it.

Just a quick note, it is quite violent in places. I didn't have a problem with it, but I know that's not everyone's cup of tea. Hot Fuzz was violent too, but in this film the action was less done for laughs.

The main character is likeable, despite what some reviewers have said. Arrogant and self righteous? Sure! But also vulnerable, with heart in the right place. Brave and/or stupid? But he's flawed which adds layers. Very fun to watch.

3804383,3,B001UV4X8S,"I would've likely ranked this film higher had I not seen writer/director Jody Hill's previous work. Hill seems to be able to write one character fairly well: the delusional, socially inappropriate, male misfit. He did it for a judo instructor in his brilliantly funny debut film ""Foot Fist Way,"" for a washed up MLB pitcher in the HBO series ""East Bound & Down,"" and now as the bizarro-Paul Blart in his new film starring Seth Rogen. As someone who has enjoyed Hill's previous work with actor Danny McBride and knows what comedy heights he is capable of, I was disappointed with this film.

It's true ""Observe & Report"" is darker than Hill's previous work (mostly due to the focus on violence and guns) and actor Seth Rogen finds a darkness inside himself which we only get a glimpse of at the end of ""Pineapple Express.""  However, ""Observe & Report's"" faults don't lie in its dark comedic tones, but rather in its reliance on formulaic film contrivances (lame montages, trite one dimensional love interests) and the fact that the main character is basically the same character from Hill's previous work, which left me with a ""been there, seen that"" feeling for most of the film.",1240099200,3,1179,4.7745098039215685
3804384,4,B001UV4X8S,"The movie starts off strong with many laughs.  It does bog down somewhat in the middle third as most comedies do when attempting to switch to a 'drama' portion of the story. This is the part of the movie when the main character believes his life is all coming together only to have it fall apart. I really wasn't sure how the director was going to pull the end of the movie back into a dark comedy but Jody hill did an excellent job of making it all come together in a nice little package.  Definitely worth watching if you like a dark comedy.  For comparison, I thought it was better than Superbad and as good or better than Knocked Up and Zack and Miri Make A Porno.  I thought Pineapple Express and The Foot Fist Way were boring.",1239494400,4,732,4.244604316546763
3804385,4,B001UV4X8S,"Arrogant. Delusional. Trigger-happy. Bipolar. These words don't often describe a hero, but in the world of Observe and Report, these characteristics reveal a protagonist who lives by a code of honor so nearly incomprehensible that it blurs the line between right and wrong, justice and vigilantism, disturbing and humorous. But it all somehow works as Seth Rogen's driving performance embodies such seriousness and commitment to a vision so morbidly dark and yet so diabolically funny. Though its degree of vulgarities will likely repulse many, Jody Hill's sophomore effort revels in its rebellious nature and entertains with an unpredictably pitch black brand of humor.

Compelled by delusions of grandeur and his own twisted sense of honor, Head of Security Ronnie Barnhardt (Seth Rogen) relentlessly pursues the forces of evil that attempt to disrupt the harmony found within the Forest Ridge Mall. When a flasher begins terrorizing women in the parking lot, including promiscuous counter girl Brandi (Anna Faris), Ronnie takes it upon himself to apprehend the deviant before real police officer Detective Harrison (Ray Liotta) can solve the case. The world needs a hero, and Ronnie is determined to become just that.

Observe and Report is like Paul Blart on crack...and weed and pills and heroin. It's a brutally unexpected twist on lighthearted comedy, substituting typical risqu humor with raucous coarseness and hallucinogenic morbidity. It succeeds because of a serious approach to everything, from the characters to the subject matter, regardless of how ridiculous the individual events - there's no conventional comic-relief bit-parts; every role is severe, even when comically deranged chaos ensues. Rogen plays a part not far removed from every other character he's embraced, but the utterly sincere approach to his determined Rambo-esque anti-hero is genuinely hilarious, especially when it's surrounded by unforeseeable violence, Borat-besting male nudity, and more montages (garnished with catchy music) than ever before seen in film.

With a scarily demented drug binge potpourri, constant psychotic delusions of majesty, perverted love during the search for a pervert, and a confused anti-hero functioning by a lawless code of his own invention, Observe and Report borders on schizophrenia, not always wanting to simply be a comedy. It's temperamental but more consistent than Pineapple Express in its offensive humor; the egos, the overstepping of real authority, the hyperactive cursing (at little kids and from old ladies) and Ronnie's belief in excessive vigilantism - like a realistic, unmasked and overweight Dark Knight - make this an explosive lesson in dark, dark comedy. Faris is perfectly pouty-faced and self-obsessed, Liotta is ideally no-nonsense and grave, and Rogen is convincingly cemented in his dizzyingly erroneous self-righteousness. It is in-your-face and out-of-control, but very wickedly funny.

Observe and Report is a well done dark comedy that features Seth Rogen's best work as an actor.  He's surrounded by a great supporting cast including Ray Liotta, Anna Faris, Aziz Ansari, and Michael Pena.

Seth Rogen is Ronnie, the troubled head of mall security, in a sometimes uncomfortable to watch story about a person's rise, fall, and rise again.

There are moments that will make you laugh out loud and there are moments that will make you want to turn away from the screen, but it adds up to a really good movie, with a sharp fast moving story.

Cons: Could a comedy ever be too dark?  Maybe, I still cant decide.

the plot

There is a male flasher who is terrorizing the female crowds at a mall in New Mexico.  Ronnie, the head of mall security is making it his mission to put a stop to this perverted menace, especially after Brandi, the cosmetics girl who Ronnie has a crush on was exposed to by the flasher.  Ronnie has a useless bunch of losers working for him on his team, so it's ultimately up to him to keep the mall safe.

Ronnie has a psychological history with his continuing condition with a bipolar disorder, and he still lives at home to take care of his alcoholic mother.  He still has to pop his pills daily to keep his psychosis at bay, and the mall is his whole life.

After the mall is robbed, and since the mall flasher is still on the prowl, a police detective named Dennis Harrison has come into the mall to investigate these crimes.  Ronnie feels that his territory and manhood has been invaded by this detective, and immediately takes a disliking to him. Detective Dennis is equally as annoyed with Ronnie for ruining his investigations with his insane wannabe police procedures.

When Ronnie finally scores a date with the beautiful Brandi, he has a new confidence along with a new outlook on life.  He has the need to better himself and gives up taking his prescription and applies for the police academy.  But how can this possibly turn out with Ronnie off of his meds?  Is the love of a woman all he really needed?  Will Ronnie make a better cop than he did a security guard?  Find out when you watch Observe and Report on blu-ray.

the breakdown

If I'm going to be honest here, the reason I was so interested to see this movie was because of the soundtrack.  I found out from a Queen fansite that Observe and Report had used some obscure classic Queen songs in the movie, and it seemed to excite them, so it had also excited me.  Also, I kind of enjoy the movies featuring Seth Rogen (Superbad, You Me & Dupree), so I figured it would be a win-win.  From the beginning, it was what I expected - an out of control script that lets the F-bomb liberally fly at will, and some gross scenes that would make me gag.  And it had all this, but it was pretty funny as well.

One of my favorite moments comes from the very beginning of the film when Ronnie was interviewed by the local news about the mall flasher.  The reporter refers to Ronnie as ""one of the security guards"" and Ronnie then calls ""Cut"" and lets the reporter know that he is head' of security. When she keeps going without making the correction or restarting the report, Ronnie says,""Ok, uh, well I'm standing here with this doctor.."" to give her a taste of her own medicine.  It was very funny, as Ronnie's disposition and humor is unapologetic and very much in-your-face.

Dennis Harrison, the detective is played by Ray Liotta (Goodfellas, Wild Hogs).  Liotta isn't as intense as some of his other roles, perhaps to take a backseat to Rogen's forceful character. His cop mannerisms though are dead on, very authentic.  Anna Faris (The House Bunny, The Hot Chick) is again the ditsy blonde, but also thrown in are healthy doses of low-life-drunken-party-girl, drama queen, and a whole lot of promiscuity.  Then there are also the newcomers Yuan twins who play the security guards Yuen twins who serve as a little bit more than the film's wallflowers.

The film starts out kind of light aside from the powerful profanity, but then it kind of slips down a very slippery slope into one of the darkest comedies I've ever seen.  I noticed that I had stopped laughing a little more than half way through, as it turned more into a dim and sinister yarn.  When we find out that Ronnie has a serious mental disorder, I start feeling sad for the character knowing that he is like this because of a disease not just to be strangely funny.  His mother's life of perpetual drunkenness seemed OK and funny in the beginning, but after we see her pass out cold, it's like a slap-in-the-face wake up call to observe yet another social disease up close.

The fact that the second half is less funny doesn't really take away from the film's allure, because I was still very drawn into the movie.  Yet it is difficult to detect how the film makes me feel about it after it's over.  There seems to be shocking and surprising events, one after the other, as we race toward the end of the film, and it's a lot to take in.

If there needed to be a saving grace here, (although I don't think it did need any saving), there were two amazing Queen songs that were used quite prominently in the movie.  It's Late from the 1977 News of the Word album was played twice, and almost all of The Hero from the Flash Gordon Soundtrack was used.  I'm not sure how the casual viewer would feel about the soundtrack, but Queen fans could do nothing but praise Observe and Report because of it, and the reason I'm here in the first place.

The movie is not for kids, and I would suggest not for viewers in the mood for a light comedy.  This is about as dark as it gets.  Expect a lot of profanity, lots of male nudity, some female nudity and also a lot of violence.  I wish someone would have prepared me for this film; I may have had a different appreciation for it.
Be prepared.

3804440,4,B001UV4X8S,"Written and directed by Jody Hill, Observe and Report is a dark comedy that goes far, far over the edge. But Hill's headlong plunge into dark, disturbing comedic territory is somehow sure-footed enough to keep him from stumbling too badly. Some viewers will see the film as a cold, clear-eyed satire of Ronnie's character, while others may see it as a celebration of his character -- which is, one hopes, not the point.

Rogen's work as Ronnnie is strong and deeper than you'd think; Ronnie's a fool and a weakling, but he occasionally has flashes of decency, and Rogen captures Ronnie's struggle toward goodness with the befuddled look of a dumb, loyal dog. Observe and Report is decidedly not for kids (try Paul Blart: Mall Cop instead...or don't), but grown-ups with a taste for the bizarre and bleak will find it as haunting as it is hilarious.",1471824000,,848,4.7687074829931975

3804454,5,B001UV4X8S,"This is not an asinine mall cop movie peddling flimsy gags put forth as mass market entertainment. It's a purposefully dark, thematically well executed film meant to dwell in the murky no man's land between reality and derangement all while remaining loose enough to lay down a fresh payload of Richard-centric humor. If you can appreciate that dichotomy then you'll dig this. If you can't or are turned off by cursing, violence, recreational drug use, theft, police beatdowns, tasing, human cruelty, human delusion, human genitalia, slight racial insensitivity, moderate date rapsim, and that dead-eyed opie who shot Jesse Pinkman's girlfriend just to prove a point (even though in this movie he's all right, but still), then you won't.
I personally think it's a worthwhile film, stylishly assembled and pushed along by the inclusion and use of excellent musical selections and with enough turns and integrity to remain compelling. It's an underdog story, at it's core, an examination of an oddly shaped piece carving the hell out of his crap pumpkin until, in the end, it's a jack-o-lantern of meaning and purpose, at least in his eyes.

3804500,3,B001UV4X8S,"Seth Rogen pretty much plays exactly the same character in every film he's ever starred in so even though this one isn't a great stretch from that norm, it is a bit of pleasant surprise to see a character mildly different.  Although I'll point out he's not a very likeable character at all.  In Observe and Report his character Ronnie Barnhardt  isn't pretending to be a nice guy, this is a very self centred, high ego, power hungry wanting early Southpark season Cartman style, for people to respect his authoritaaaa!  Well Seth's character Ronnie doesn't actually utter that line.  He wants to be the hero, get the hot girl and sees others such as a police detective who is investigating a flasher at the mall to be deliberately hampering his goal.  Ronnie is rude to his colleagues, his boss and other employees at the mall.  In reality he would get fired pretty quick but we wouldn't have much of a movie if that was the case. He's supposed to be taking his meds but has decided not to escalating his dark natured behaviour.

The film does play heavily on stereotypes to try and get the laughs, such as his two Asian colleagues, and when films do this they obviously will offend some people.  There's also a rape scene of a girl completely out of it drugged and drunk in this one and fairly lengthy time wise shots of full frontal nudity of the flasher.  I don't think any of these things were necessary for the plot of the film but they are all in here.  There's some things that are never really explained such as how at one point Ronnie suddenly has exceptional one on one combat skills, a bit of backstory may have made that believable.

Overall the movie is watchable but if you're expecting Mall Cop with different characters or even much of a comedy you're best looking elsewhere.  This is more of a shock value film than anything else.",1425859200,,1847,4.52710843373494

3804644,5,B001UV4X8S,"Upon first seeing this film in the theater, I thought it was cool, different, unexpected, etc., but I didn't exactly have a burning desire to watch it again; some parts were just weird, and, at times, I wasn't really sure what the film was going for. However, since that time, I fell in love with the HBO show, ""Eastbound and Down""--which is written and directed by the same person as ""Observe and Report,"" Jody Hill. I feel like now that I've gotten used to Jody Hill's humor, this film makes so much more ""sense"" to me, and is a lot funnier than the first time I watched it.

Main point:  if you enjoyed Eastbound and Down, you will almost certainly enjoy this film, because the style of humor is very much the same: dark, twisted, and uncomfortably hilarious... Seth Rogen is not far off from ""Kenny Powers,"" and Danny McBride even has a cameo in it.

Mr. Rogen is definetly not cut from the same cloth as Kevin James's Paul Blart in New Jersey and that is a good thing.  This movie has been referred to as the ""dark mall cop"" film and that title is appriate.  The humor is definetly more adult-orientated.  I personally enjoyed parts of it, especially Ray Leiata's straight-man performance as a police detective, so I'll ultimately leave the purchasing decision up to you.

3804653,4,B001UV4X8S,"If you are conservative or easily offended, then this is not the movie for you. With that said, I had heard this movie was not what most people where going to expect from the line up of Actors. I knew it was not another ""Mall Cop"" type movie when I purchased this movie. A couple of friends told me about this film, so I had to see it for myself.

As you have most likely read other reviews of this movie, you probably know all the dark and somewhat offensive content in the film. I am not that easily offended and thought that the movie was very edgy and could not pull myself away from it. The best parts of the movie, in my opinion, are the scenes with the flasher. I will not go to much into the details of the film as it has been extensively reviewed by others, so you get the idea of the movie.

The whole issue of bi-polar disorder reminds me of a friend that has almost same existence as Seth Rogan's character in this movie. He is 45, live with his mom and some of his other mental case friends play board games in the basement. He works at a convenience store and some nights he is so out of hand they send him home. Thank the God of your choice for better living through chemistry.

But as far as the movie goes, I would recommend this only to those who are not easily offended or dislike violence. It is one of those ""Love it or Hate it"" types of movies that we have watched a couple of times. The sad thing is that this film doesn't stray far from reality in this day and age.

I have seen a couple of films that made me feel quite ill, but not really offended. The one film that comes to mind is ""Trainspotting"".",1382054400,,1626,4.087774294670846

I usually love Seth Rogan, I think he's one of the best comedic actors out there, but unfortunately every actor is going to have a few misses. Observe and Report is one of those films that just doesn't cut it. In the film, Seth Rogan plays Ronnie Barnhardt, who is the equivalent of Paul Blart on a bad trip. He's a mall cop, who is obsessed with his job and with the hot girl who works the make-up counter at the local department store. Literally the only funny part of this movie is the flasher, that Ronnie is trying to catch. It's simplistic humor, but a man running around a mall, flashing his penis at people, and making dirty comments is funny! The rest of this film is not, as it's one big racist, childish, romp, through a world of sex, drugs, and the abuse of power. Rogan is terrific, but his character was a rambling, confused, uneducated guy, that just wears on every last nerve. Observe and Report is a film that has been done, many times and in many different ways. The producers hoped that an all-star cast would help the film, but sadly it doesn't. The film plays as though it was written by a teenager, and all that's missing is the fart jokes.

You have such a good character line up, the plot is pretty good, love the adult crude dry humor, if you really don't like this movie then you must of probably didn't pay enough attention to it (i.e. texting).

Anna Farris who plays a remarkably stunning job in this film!!!I love the soundtrack as well!!! Very good comedy!!! It's a lot better than at least half of the comedies out coming out now a days. and it's sad this movie got bad reviews because it seems for a comedy to be admired you have to have more 'newer generational' actors like that kid from super bad or 21 Jump Street(excellent film) and I do think that's sad. This film wasn't AMAZING but it is a comedy I would reccomended. If noone thought the ending was funny and had a very good climax/tie up then they obviously weren't observing.

Observe and Report takes this similar concept and makes the end result of a man-child 'saving the day' into far more consequential and disturbing tone, which was a very welcome breath of fresh air for me. I think the reason Observe and Report has such low ratings is because it looks like another dumb upbeat comedy where the main character is just misunderstood when instead it took those ideas into much darker territory. Another thing that threw audiences off was the coincedential release of Paul Blart: Mall Cop which was a PG family comedy; so I think general audiences walked into this expecting Paul Blart with more fart jokes and swear words, hooooo boy were they wrong.

So Observe and Report follows a mentally deranged mall cop Ronnie Barnheart, who takes his job far too seriously. The whole movie is basically a running gag of how delusional and psychotic Ronnie is as he tries to step up his game and join the New Mexico police force, and it worked for me. His character goes through some hardships and reality hits him hard at some parts, however it doesn't seem like he really learned anything new at the end, he's still the same deranged psychopath we're introduced to, and I liked that darker ending instead of him smiling with a family or something. As I mentioned above Observe and Report takes the whole man-child comedy genre and flips it on it's head, and that's the main reason I liked it so much, hopefully more dark comedies screw around with that tired formula.

The weird thing about Observe and Report though is it seems to be on the fence about how it's played out, there's a predictable love story tacked on which seemed unnecessary and they needed that part soley for marketing purposes, a confrontation at the end where Ronnie assaults police officers that seemed to have no consequences for him, which was very strange considering there's consequences for the rest of his actions. Ronnie's 'crew' were also criminally underdeveloped, I know they're basically just his yes-men but we saw no insight into why they're following this lunatic's orders, Dennis was still pretty funny and had some more character to him but the two Asian twins literally do nothing but say 'yes' and wave to Ronnie.

Overall Observe and Report isn't something most movie-going audiences will be interested, the laughs are more character and situation driven than actual jokes, and if soemone asked me ""well what was a funny part"" I wouldn't really know what to say because there aren't really any one-liners, it's all situational. Seth Rogen's acting as a psychopath isn't a great performance but I do appreciate that he's trying something new that isn't cheesy like Will Ferral's 'dramedies'. Fans of Eastbound and Down however will no doubt enjoy this movie, as it retains Jody Hill's style of comedy. Observe and Report feels like an uncertain but confident first step in a new type of comedy I'm hoping to see more of.

P.S. the soundtrack is great",1338336000,4,3203,4.828779599271402
3804713,1,B001UV4X8S,I bought this dvd after reading some customer reviews some said it was funnier than mall cop. NO WAY! this movie is all about bad words. Not a family movie waste of money don't buy this.,1333929600,,186,4.194444444444445
3804714,5,B001UV4X8S,"This movie is the anti-thesis of every mall cop movie out there. Consider the mall security guard normally presented in movies as a screwball character with an overactive sense of purpose and superiority who continuously gets into stupid, impossible situations but wins the girl and the respect of everyone in the end. Now take a step back and imagine what that person would be like in real life: that is the essence of Observe & Report. It zooms in on that maniacal mall guard and keeps him under the microscope for a full analysis.

This movie is dark. The main character is bi-polar and borderline insane. The movie follows him during an awkward time in his life when he decides to ditch his meds and is obviously suffering due to not being on those meds. This begins when his grasp on reality and his sense of esteem and power is questioned when he is consumed with powerlessness by a flasher at the mall, who cannot be caught, followed closely by multiple robberies. The scenes that follow show a person careening out of control toward what would likely be suicide but in the end, finds redemption and self-worth and re-examines his life and priorities. Seth Rogen is a modern day anti-hero in a mall security guard guise.

I love this movie and all of Jody Hill's work as a writer and/or director. I do not expect everyone to love this movie; especially if you're expecting Pineapple Express or even Fist Foot Way (prior Jody Hill film starring Danny McBride). This is Jody Hill and Seth Rogen pushing the envelope and turning those expectations on their head. Their are moments of absolute hilarity in this move but they are often the kind of jokes that make you cringe somewhere inside or squirm uncomfortably. This can turn people away; but me, I love those movies. They challenge the audience to look at those around them a bit more deeply and not take everything at face value.

This is by far Jody Hill and Seth Rogen's best work. If you are a fan of either one, you will not be disappointed.

Regarding the blu-ray: excellent; crisp, clear, sharp and just fantastically done. I would have loved to see more extras but such is life. Maybe once the star ratings on Amazon reach 4-5, they can push Warner Brothers to chuck out more dough to stuff more stuff on the disc.",1328659200,8,2280,4.608374384236453
3804715,5,B001UV4X8S,"Ok, this movie has gotten many bad Reviews, but honestly, i don't know what those people who gave bad reviews were thinking. Those who know & like Seth Rogan and his movies and/or are simply into Funny, Comedy, Humor, or ""keep you laughing"" type of movies will love watching it. You can compare OBSERVE AND REPORT to MALL COP because Seth Rogan plays a Mall Security Officer (Not Police related) and in many ways is similar to that movie. BUT, the difference is that OBSERVE AND REPORT is more intended for the Adult crowd. It starts out with a fat, ugly, Pervert, that goes around the parking lots of the Mall hunting and Flashing (AKA showing his Penis to) unsuspecting women. Seth, feeling that the hot girl he likes might be threatend by this sick man decides it's up to him to catch the creep and save the day. But after the ""real"" police step in to find the man, he feels that his chance to ""hook up"" with the girl he like will slip away. Later in the movie we find out Seth Rogan takes medication that helps him to not go mentally crazy, but still, all of a sudden he feels he doesnt need it any more and stops taking it (which causes his behavior to change). After he finds out the girl he likes is having sex with the Police Detective, he gets into more problems which almost causes him to lose his job. When he finally gets back on the right track, he captures the fat pervert, proffs to himself and everyone else he is capable of solving crimes, catching criminals, and is responsible enough to know how to hold and use a gun, and worthy of being a true police officer.

Seth Rogan and the other great actors in this movie work together to make OBSERVE AND REPORT one of the Best, Funny, Humoristic, movies you will ever get to enjoy.

I had no idea what I was in for when started this movie, but found myself uncomfortable and even sometimes upset by what I was watching.
The deconstruction of a man who has built a perception of life around himself to guard him from the truth that he has accomplished nothing. Surrounding himself with supplicants to continue his delusional mindset Seth Rogen's character gets darker and darker until he practically self-destructs.

3804723,2,B001UV4X8S,"This movie reminds me of Ebert's complaint about ""The Cable Guy"", that basically the audience doesn't want Jim Carrey to play an unpleasant character. Observe and Report is an empty film. It tries a lot of things, has some laughs, but ultimately its just empty.
I've seen other films without a core---28 Weeks Later immediately jumps to mind, probably the emptiest movie I've ever seen. Now I don't have a problem with nihilism. It can even be fun---watch Bad Santa if you don't believe me. Observe and Report tries for the same, and I was rooting for it, but unfortunately nothing really happens. In fact, the film has a lot of influences right up there on the screen: we see a nice dose of Taxi Driver, a sprinkle of Shawshank, perhaps a little Napoleon Dynamite, and an interesting ripoff of the Fight Club ending. Now I'll never be able to hear that song without thinking of male privates.
Sometimes you'll hear about a movie before it opens and then not hear about it again when the product is released. I found that to be the case with this film, and wondered why. Now I know: not only is this movie mediocre, it's kind of hard to make heads or tails of. It's like the screenwriters had no idea what they wanted. Simple truth, the Seth Rogan character has no substance, and is unpleasant. That's tough to overcome, considering this character carries the film effort. You could say the same thing perhaps about the Bad Santa lead, that he has no substance and is unpleasant, but that movie had direction, knew what to do with him, and managed to make the nihilism interesting and funny. This one more goes through the motions of being a black comedy than making it work. It gives me no pleasure to criticize the film; I like black comedies. Darkness makes no difference to me and can be interesting.
You can tell this one wants to be a cool, unconventional film. It tries very hard to be something. Maybe if the movie knew what to do with the main character, it would have gone somewhere. Definitely see Paul Blart instead.",1299196800,,2028,4.574175824175824

Buying guide: This is a movie guys might watch with a bunch of other guys while drinking beer and punching each other in the arm. This is NOT a date movie, and not a family oriented movie. The cursing had my wife complaining in 5 minutes, and she left the room after 10 minutes. I am more tolerant, but I found the constant cursing annoying and detracting from the movie. (I stuck out the whole thing just to give it a fair shot)

Okay, set aside the swearing for a minute, since the main character is mentally unbalanced. As a comedy, this is not a light-hearted comedy but rather a trip down the twisted mind of someone mentally unbalanced. And as dark comedies go, there are far better ones out there. As a romantic comedy (because there is a love triangle between the main character and two mall girls) it did marginally better, but again there are many hundreds of better ones out there.

The acting was okay, as were the actors. (I enjoyed Ray Liotta as the tolerant detective) There was one plot twist related to some of the crime going on at the mall, which came off rather well.

Simply put, Ronnie (Rogen) is a mall cop who seeks higher stature by becoming a police officer and winning the heart of Anna Faris.  However, Rogen is not exactly great at his job.  A flasher invades the mall premises and someone is breaking into stores, and Ronnie's best police work is to racially profile and draw a sketch of the offensive ""weapon"".  When his attempt to join the police force fails, the film takes a decidedly darker turn (and I thank the director for that!) in what is perhaps the most hilarious sequence.

It's a film that should be enjoyed on the pure fact that it is so stupid.  You should probably pair it with shots of whiskey or some pot.

All kidding aside, this has some funny laughs here and there and some may not even be intentional.  For some reason, I couldn't seem to pay attention to the plot either because the soundtrack just did not provide what was needed.

So what is Observe and Report about?  Some mall security cop, Ronald, trying to catch a flasher running loose harassing mall patrons and workers.  Police detective gets involved and Ronald tries to prove he is better than the police.  Unfortunately, Ronald is a loser and does everything wrong.  His miserable life is so miserable that its hard to feel sorry for him because the guy is a prick as well.

For the cast put together for this film, I'd expect more from Ray Liotta, Anna Faris, Seth Rogen, Aziz Ansari, etc.  I guess the funniest part for me was some of the cast itself.  I couldn't help to laugh at the two fat Asian twins and the Matt Damon look-alike.

""Little Miss Sunshine""--you know, that ""great"" movie about the fat kid and her wretched family with the best of intentions?  And ""The Strangers""--who liked that?!

Some people think the ""humor"" here is SO intelligent you'd have to be a moron to not get it.  Or you're of questionable ""hipness"" if you don't.  I guess they're ""too cool for school"" and the rest of us are the geek squad.  Please.  There's nothing to get here.  There's no there there.  The movie just freakin sucks.  Anyone can understand that statement :)

Rogen's character, Ronnie, is so unsympathetic and delusional that you root AGAINST him from the start.  And you're glad when the cops beat his a--.  How is he even employed?  When you see that boss of his you'll know why.  Then again, maybe you won't.  That character just takes up space making no impact on any other character including the dangerously delusional Ronnie.  Did he even have any lines?

Ronnie's mom is a cheap, unfunny knockoff of so many other drunk but ""caring"" mother characters.  Man, I wish I could name one ;)  But we've seen this character much funnier many other places.  She also adds nothing but another drain on your expectation of SOMETHING.

The twin guards should have been more, but there too is more drain on your expectations.  This time doubled.

Ronnie's best friend, Dennis...really?  THAT was supposed to be funny?  He needed a shower and a speech therapist.  That was just aggravating.

Ray Liotta looked as good (or as made up or made over) as ever.

The whole movie is a mish mosh of non-impactful characters with no connections except their presences in the mall.  It's just not funny and at the end you're like, ""What was THAT supposed to be?""

I DID like ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop.""  It was cute, funny, character interactions MADE SENSE, plot MADE SENSE, and it was non-offensive (and I curse like a drunken Marine at times, so don't even go there).  It's just a pleasant movie.  It makes for good ""background noise"" when there's nothing else on and you don't feel like finding a DVD to watch.

""Pineapple Express"" gets funnier every time I have it on.  That's another ""background noise"" movie for me.  There're so many funny lines in it, if you're not paying attention to the whole movie straight through, you miss SO MUCH humor.

Anyway, Observe and Report.  The one hilarious scene is when Ronnie accuses Saddam(n) of being the thief.  And each one HAS to get the last ""words"" in.  Memorable.  One.

You could be forgiven for thinking you'd somehow stumbled into ""Mall Cop 2"" while watching ""Observe and Report"" - except that ""Observe and Report""  makes the hapless ""Mall Cop 1"" look like ""Citizen Kane"" in comparison.

Even the crime Rogen is bent on solving - a portly flasher running around the mall terrorizing shoppers - is ridiculously mediocre in terms of dramatic effectiveness and leads to a completely underwhelming finale.

To me, the only barely redeeming factor was the music, but even The Band playing Dylan's When I Paint My Masterpiece cannot save this ""film.""

I watched it on TV, so the only thing I lost was time. I can't imagine spending a dime to see this movie. It is neither a comedy nor a drama, or if it is it fails miserably at both.

Amazon has it categorized as Black Comedy, and in that category we have superb films such as Brazil, Fargo, After Hours, Dr. Strangelove, American Psycho, Trainspotting, and dozens and dozens of great films. Some things that immediately come to mind when I think about those films is that they're intelligent, well written, well crafted, with characters that have depth. Observe and Report presents us with mostly one-dimensional characters, and the characters that are more complex are not really developed. I don't expect Seth Rogen to be as good as De Niro was in Taxi Driver, but everything about this movie felt a bit flat. There was no range, no subtlety, no climax. Ray Liotta actually did a good job. What was he doing in this movie?

Perhaps with better writing, better directing, better acting, this type of film could be worth watching. The editing could also be better. Some scenes went for too long, while other scenes added nothing to the movie.

3804783,5,B001UV4X8S,"This is a clever film, which makes effective use of irony - an unusual trait in a Hollywood production. The main character, Ronnie, played by Seth Rogen, is a wonderful mix of self-confident, obnoxious and delusional, which makes for some funny moments early in the film, and becomes surprisingly touching as we learn more about the background of the character. The trailers give a good feel for the style, and, if you liked them, you will probably like the film too. Ronnie, a mall security guard who seems himself as an upholder of the law and defender of justice. He considers a mall flasher to be his ""big case"", and is determined to crack it. Viewers who want to live vicariously through the main character might find this film unsatisfying, and perhaps this accounts for the poor ratings, but from a more detached perspective, it is extremely funny, as well as being a clever comment on our cultural fixation on heroism.

One noteworthy aspect of the film is the attention paid to some of the minor characters. It's a tribute not only to the actors, but to the film's strong writing and direction. Anna Faris's character might easily have been a cookie-cutter bimbo, but her character feels like she has a life of her own, and, as shallow lives go, it has some depth. In the same way, Ronnie's alcoholic, promiscuous mother (Celia Weston) could easily have been a one-dimensional cliche, but is instead a character with heart. She is pathetic, hitting on her son's friends, and falling off the couch in a drunken stupor, but there is also a sense of genuine affection and understanding between her and her son. The characters are both broad and real, which is a hard balance to achieve.

I'm mystified by the poor reception that Observe and Report received. Perhaps it is too smart a film for its screwball comedy genre. It has some goofy elements, but the intrinsic irony of the main character, the disconnect between the way Ronnie sees himself, and the way the other characters see him, add complexities that make this a far more varied movie than the standard Judd Apatow offerings. The film Observe and Report most resembles, for its mix of comedy, delusion and pathos is Scorsese's King of Comedy, while the keen observation on the minor characters is reminiscent of Fast Times at Ridgemont High or Brother From Another Planet.

Ronnie is intent on catching the criminals but has no investigative skills, is delusional about his abilities, and makes mad accusations.

All the while believing that he is valiant and just. This, combined with his way of dealing with his own metal shortcomings, makes him horribly endearring.

3804805,4,B001UV4X8S,"Upon going into the theatre for ""Observe and Report"" on its opening day, I was under the impression that I was about to see an 18A-rated Mall Cop.

Boy, was I surprised when I found out how wrong I was.

Nevertheless, dark comedies have always been something I've had a knack for, and if you're expecting a ""Mall Cop for adults"", you best not even touch the DVD. Because believe me, Observe and Report is a dark, twisted, and VERY violent romp through bi-polar disorder, drug use, date rape, and a man running around and flashing people.

If I haven't put you off seeing this movie, you can continue reading this review.

Yeah, something tells me I put a bunch of people off watching this movie just by that comment in the above paragraph alone. The 2.5 star out of 5 rating is caused mostly by people who walked into this movie not knowing the dark film they were about to see, and expecting a sex comedy. If anything, I was surprised when I decovered its dark comedy. Nonetheless I enjoyed it quite a bit. Fronted by Seth Rogen, Observe and Report is the chronicles of an every-day man with bipolar disorder and the obnoxious tendencies that consume him.

Seth Rogen plays Ronnie Barndhart, a security guard at a shopping mall in New Mexico. He has bipolar disorder, which does get him in quite a bit of trouble. He lives with his mom, who is an alcoholic, but loves him dearly. He enjoys seeing the incredibly cute Nell at the coffee shop every day and getting free coffee from her, and enjoys talking to Brandi, who works in the makeup department of a Sears-type store.

However, a streaker has been wreaking havoc at the mall. He goes around flashing people in the parking lot and in the mall. Ronnie, and the rest of the security team have a plan to take the streaker and turn him in to the police department. One day, on her way to work, the streaker flashes Brandi, mentally scarring her. After talking to her and comforting her, Ronnie seems to develop displays of affection towards Brandi and even asks her out. The rest of the movie turns into a twisted and violent romp that is definitely not for the prudish, but most definitely NOT for the faint of heart!

Observe and Report is a brutal and twisted movie, but that's to say that I enjoyed it immensely! In fact, I like to look at this movie as a twisted stage play. This could actually work as a really good stage play, as the writing had sort of a theatrical feel to it, as if the story could work well on stage too. Rogen turns in a wonderful performance as Ronnie, our bipolar anti-hero for the 86 minutes. Anna Faris also excels here, with her portrayal of the adorably slutty Brandi. All of the cast seems to be especially great here, with no question.

As the film approaches its last 30 minutes, you feel as if you dunno whether or not you're watching the movie or having a REALLY messed up dream. There is a date-rape scene in there that has caused outrage among some viewers, which, if looked at correctly, is rather darkly funny (I think rape is a horrible but it was done humorously). The violence, especially for a comedy, is surprisingly brutal- and even exaggerated in some aspects too. The dark tones are evident there, as you see some of the most twisted stuff in film ever. But that said... it's really good.

I can see why people would hate this movie. It certainly is NOT for everybody. So many will hate it and so few will actually et the point of it. But if you lower your expectations, this is a movie that is very enjoyable, and for that, remains a personal favorite of mine.

IN TOTAL:
Entertainment: 8/10
Sex: 4/10, or 3/10 if you don't count date rape
Violence: 6/10
Laughs: quite a few, but this is no laugh riot
Brutality: 10+/10

3804840,4,B001UV4X8S,"Many mainstream comedies flirt with edginess, but underneath all the bad language and sexuality are actually pretty toothless, filled with characters who are generally harmless goofballs and experiences that aren't too far outside of most people's frame of reference.  Observe and Report is not one of these movies--instead, it's the rare big-studio comedy that actually flirts with a legitimate sense of menace, from its frequently creepy and unbalanced protagonist to the occasional outbreaks of bluntly portrayed violence to the generally depraved behavior that fills much of its efficient run time.  I've read in a few places that writer/director Jody Hill was partly inspired by Taxi Driver in making this movie, and after a couple of viewings it makes perfect sense, as Observe and Report is filled with the same pessimistic worldview, punctuated by all-too rare examples of nobility, that characterized Scorcese's classic.  Much like Hill's criminally underappreciated HBO series Eastbound and Down, the movie mines considerable laughs from discomfort and embarrassment, and sheer inappropriateness, as well as from the gap between how people view themselves and how the rest of the world views them.  It's certainly not the best comedy ever made, but it is a testament to how much can be wrung out of a loaded cast and a few memorable scenes.

The movie takes place in a world frighteningly close to our own in its abundance of generally angry and unsatisfied people, and leading the way is Seth Rogen's revelatory performance as Ronnie Barnhardt, an amusingly unhinged mall security chief and aspiring cop whose view of himself and his job contrasts sharply with that of pretty much everyone around him.  It would be an understatement to say Ronnie is the antithesis of Rogen's usual pot-smoking slacker persona--Ronnie would probably soundly beat such a character if given the opportunity.  The change in this case is for the better though: if anything, Rogen's general cluelessness and occasionally scary intensity are even more amusing than the air of slacker-ish indifference he's cultivated so often in the past.  Ronnie is Travis Bickle transplanted to a bland suburban nightmare, trying to find excitement and adventure in a landscape characterized more by overwhelming banality, pettiness, and tedium.  At the same time, though, as it goes on the movie does raise the question of whether it's Ronnie who's crazy, or the world around him.  After all, Ronnie may be an unstable, delusional gun nut, but he doesn't take part in the backstabbing, deception, and outright cruelty that we regularly see among numerous other characters.  Ronnie is actually a firm believer in romance and chivalry, even if the former involves having sex with an extremely inebriated makeup-counter girl and the latter involves beating and threatening the mean-spirited boss of a coffeeshop employee he's befriended.

Playing the Cybil Shepherd to Rogen's buffoonish De Niro, Anna Faris manages to find a role worthy of her comic talents as Brandi, the object of Ronnie's affections, a drunken, pill-popping cosmetics-counter worker who shows little interest in Ronnie until she finds him to be a reliable source of booze and prescription drugs.  When Brandi sees more than she'd like to of a portly serial flasher who's been traumatizing women in the mall parking lot, it gives Ronnie the perfect opportunity to mix one unhealthy obsession with another as he tries to reduce by one the number of perverts in the world and get closer to the girl of his dreams in the process.  Ronnie's investigation also earns him a worthy nemesis in the form of Detective Harrison (Ray Liotta), the cynical cop assigned to the case who does not share Ronnie's passion for justice, at least not as applies to relatively minor cases involving parking-lot flashers.  In addition to providing some quality comic fodder, the ongoing clash between Ronnie and Harrison highlights a great deal of what makes Ronnie a sympathetic character despite his occasionally psychotic behavior--in a world filled with people who skate by at work and look out for number one, Ronnie does care, even if it's a little too much.  The movie does actually allow Ronnie to experience some catharsis and personal growth as it goes along, even if his newfound sense of self does little to dull his more aggressive tendencies.

Those looking for focus and tight plotting would be well advised to look elsewhere--even at a mere 90 minutes or so the movie starts to sag a bit towards the end--but when it devotes itself to its twisted character study and Office Space-style slice-of-life comedy Observe and Report functions more than well enough.  At times it's almost impressionistic, relying on a series of montages and hilarious single shots and a great soundtrack (the use of McLusky's Lightsabre C---sucking Blues is especially appreciated) where dialogue wouldn't suffice to get its themes across.  It also helps a great deal to have great comic actors like Michael Pena, Patton Oswalt, Danny McBride, and Aziz Ansari turning their supporting roles into memorable characters in their own right and keeping the proceedings amusing even when they're not really proceeding anywhere.  Overall Observe and Report boasts a strong mix of dark humor, character development, and flat-out wrongness that should appeal nicely to those put off by more mainstream comedy.  While by no means uniformly brilliant, it's definitely worthy of a look.",1257897600,4,5484,5.216154721274175
3804841,4,B001UV4X8S,"Not to say that writer/director Jody Hill is the new Scorscese (he's not), but I was constantly reminded of Scorscese's early 80s disturbo-comedy ""King of Comedy"" when watching this. Whereas Scorscese uses stark realism, though, Hill uses the conventions and expectations of modern comedy to nail us. This could have easily been another crude and rude comedy along the lines of Superbad or Pineapple Express. Those (hell, most) comedies made today feature borderline-sociopathic, emotionally-retarded, and hopelessly immature males. Hill simply tips his characters over the edge. There is no denying that Ronnie (Seth Rogan) is a full-blown psychopath. What's surprising is how close this character is to every other character Seth Rogan has ever played!

3804843,1,B001UV4X8S,"Someone needs to tell these filmmakers that a ""dark comedy"" does not entail a lot of really explicit violence (!), frontal (male) nudity and swearing!

After all the hype and some good reviews in the press I thought I'd give it a try, since I've enjoyed some of Rogen's work in the past - but approached it with some reservations because for instance ""Zack & Miri Make A Porno"" and ""Pineapple Express"" (Rogen's previous starring roles) were complete disasters.

All in all, this left me feeling annoyed and in anxiety, uneasy even. A few mild chuckles, but that's IT. An incredibly weak effort.

Also - Anna Faris, who used to have a cute ""girl next door"" type look, has apparently also succumbed to the pressures of being insecure in Hollywood, and proceeded to get what looks like a seriously botched overblown lip job. So bad in fact, that I found it difficult to watch her without feeling queasy.

I also couldn't help but feel BAD for Ray Liotta (I know I shouldn't, I'm sure he received a hefty paycheck for his efforts) who seemed completely lost in this turkey and played his standard detective role on auto pilot.

For GOOD dark comedy go towards the British Isles: ""Hot Fuzz"" (film) or ""The League Of Gentlemen"" (BBC tv series), for example.",1257206400,5,1251,4.668181818181818

The central character, Ronnie(Seth Rogen), is a self-delusional manic depressive prone to violence.  Rogen, whose star rises with each movie, injects just the right amount of empathy in Ronnie to make him palatable.  Anna Faris goes against type in playing an unlikable cosmetics girl but it is no less an inspired turn on her part.  The laugh quotient is high if your personal taste allows.

This isn't the movie I expected. Now that's not a bad thing. But be warned, not typical goofball/slacker

brink of self annihilation. Now, that's not a bad thing, so long as you know what to expect from
what you're buying. If you like dark comedy. If you like to watch suffering play out, this may be what
you're looking for. And don't get me wrong, I really did enjoy the movie, once I knew what I was watching.

3804912,5,B001UV4X8S,"Most comedies make one suspend one's beliefs and provides cheap laughs which end up like cheap highs--they lose their effect and soon bore over time. Not so with Observe and Report.

Observe and Report (OAR) is a revelation! And an affirmation that Jody Hill (along with his Fist Foot Way and Eastbound and Down) is forging a new movement in comedy by providing unmasked realism! This movie takes realistic ""everyday"" people and situations to their true ends where no typical Hollywood comedy or movie would go. It provides realism connoisseurs with immense levels of joy and satisfaction.

OAR centers around Ronnie, a protagonist with all his imperfections as well as his strengths. He is loud and strong, takes his ridiculed job very seriously, he speaks his mind all the time, and he takes care of his friends and family. As such, he earns the respect of his co-security guards and a fellow mall food court worker. He may not be super likeable by movie viewers who only look at hotshot Hollywood hunks, due to his chunky looks, racial prejudices, and his violent acts when off his meds but he does the best he can as product of a single drunk mother, holding a steady, unflattering job, all while being bi-polar.

Ronnie's life starts out small but complete as head of security in a typical shopping mall along with a band of interesting security guards. He takes care of his loving but hard drinking mom. He has a unforgetable right hand man, Dennis, who is 100% hilarious as he is criminal. Dennis's scenes are pure magic! His initial love interest is a blond cosmetic counter ""party girl"" (played by Anna Faris) who he eventually sees as not his type of girl. :) Over the course of what seems like a few days, he nearly loses his life to a vengeful detective, he goes off his meds, he loses his meaning in life, goes on a mini violence spree, sees his life in ruins, holds true to his character and his convictions, and finally regains his small life back again along with a girlfriend Nell (who is undeniably sweet and has heart wrenching scene).

OAR is a great character movie because it is oh so real. There is no need to go to a fantasy world for 90 minutes and rebound back to reality. This movie is reality!
Every character is real (as in people you see in real life). The plot plays out naturally as it should with the characters involved. Of course this means this movie is not for sheltered Hollywood addicted fans who are looking beautiful people and escapist sugary silly storylines. But hey, that's their problem. In fact, these sugary movie addicts should ask themselves why they need to so desperately escape reality? Perhaps they need Dennis Chevante to show them the way. :)

Those who are unafraid of reality and life will agree that Observe and Report is pure delight. I look forward to more wonderful character movies from Jody Hill. I also hope that he continues to use more unknown actors which makes his movies even more authentically realistic.",1256083200,6,2975,4.680688336520077

Had this movie been made 30 years ago, it probably would stand out as a cult classic, but in present time's when comedy from such film makers like Adam Sandler, the whole cliche of fat guys exposing themselves and stupid scenes of that which you'd expect in an outtake, has just gotten tiresome and boring. Especially old ladies cussing and saying things in a crude manner. (done to death since Betty White in Lake Placid)

Rogan play's the head of security for a shopping mall; along with his stupid side-kicks, he is trying to catch a flasher that is exposing himself to people in the mall while at the same time trying to out-do the detective in charge of the case, Ray Liota; all while dealing with his drunken mother, trying to win over Anna Farris, and a love interest you will roll your eyes at seeing it coming a mile away before the movie has even gotten past the warning screen. In the end you are just left to wonder why they hell they would go with such a done-to-death, seen-it-a-million0times already kind type of plot.

There may be a few chuckles here and there, but in honesty, I think anyone who see's this would see it as a PG rated movie that only get's a higher classification for the amount of swearing and 2 seconds of unneeded nudity. This movie should just go back to the editing room, cut out the cussing, delete the unneeded and unfunny adult themes, and show it on something like the Disney Channel. Until then, don't expect much. There is pretty much nothing memorable about any of the movie. It's as far away from an original idea as possible, too many done to death, seen-it-before scenes to make you yawn, and none of that over the top sick sense of humor you have come to expect from a movie with Rogan in it.

If you are interested in seeing this for some reason, i'd highly recommend you either watch it online for free, shop lift a copy, or get a copied version for no more then the price of the disc itself, as purchasing, renting or even waiting for it to be on TV will leave you in a huge disappointment unless your one of those weirdos who must own everything one the actors in this movie are apart of.

It's not the worst movie of all time, it isn't actually boring, but I would recommend a psych evaluation to anyone who considers this movie to be part of there personal top 1000 movies of all time.

I have a wacky sense of humor, love comedies and enjoy most dark comedies, but this may be the worst movie I have ever watched.  This doesn't even really qualify as a comedy as the few funny parts in the movie weren't really funny.  At the end of the film I was left to wonder what the point was.  I'm not the sharpest crayon in the box, but I can usually make sense of implied and ambiguous messages.  This made no sense.
I can see having a fantasy movie where you get to beat up all of the people who have wronged you in some way to appeal to our inner demons that sometimes press to be unleashed.  But usually that would involve a likable character who despite some character flaws was at heart a good person.  This isn't even close.  Ronnie is a mean spirited individual who indiscriminately hands out brutal and often graphic beatings to anyone he chooses because he is f'd up in the head, and gets away with it.  Even to the point that he is applauded after shooting an unarmed flasher at point blank range, spraying blood everywhere.
As far as the rest of the cast goes, they are written and performed as one dimensional caricatures with no depth or redeeming qualities.
I am a fan of Seth Rogen, and he can act in any movie he pleases, but this movie knocked him down a few notches in my opinion.  It will be hard to watch him in future movies without thinking about this horrible character.  For his own good I hope he is a little more discerning next time.
As far as the director, Jody Hill.  I'm not sure what disturbs me more, the fact that he writes this crap or that he actually has a fan base because of it.  I guess the only thing you could give him credit for is illiciting a strong response.  [...]",1255478400,12,1892,4.231197771587744

There truly is nothing better than going into a film and getting something that you did not expect. I know, at the risk of sounding pompous, that I am among the few Americans who enjoy this, but it's just a fact; and Observe and Report is exactly the opposite of everything most people will expect going into it.

Observe and Report could very well be Seth Rogen's ""the Cable Guy"", meaning that it could possibly make a fairly big, dark dent in his career for the time being, but in years to pass people will see it for what it truly is; it's not a comedy in the sense of Knocked-Up or the 40 Year Old Virgin, this is more on par with something Todd Solondz, think Happiness: a film filled to the brim with unlikeable characters, would do if he wasn't so neurotic.

I bring up Carrey's black sheep of a film because it's basically the exact same set up; Rogen is America's new favorite goofball / sweetie pie / whatever, the film is, more or less, being advertised as a simple comedy; he plays a mall security cop who thinks he's going to save the world, tee hee hee hee, right? Wrong.

It's a dark film, and those going in with expectations of a few crotch jokes won't be pleased with some of the content and the manner they perceive it to be shown in; one scene, between Rogen and Faris in particular has garnered some attention for it's presentation as being comedic when in fact it isn't at all, but what can you expect from the MPAA & other assorted moral do gooders.

Rogen's character is interesting because of his actions, his beliefs; he's a funny guy, but his character is far from funny. A man, obviously, suffering from delusion and some degree of narcissism, thinks that he knows what is right and only his idea of right is the right one (that's a lot of rights, 'ey?) His actions will make most cringe, and his ideas and, most of all, dreams will make others unbearably uncomfortable, but that is where the genius of the film is. You can identify with Rogen's character, but why do you? Why don't you? It's a comedic film that expects viewers to think; there in lay the problem.

The comedy of the film isn't blatant and it's not served to you on a platter in a veil of obviousness; I can't quite grasp how to describe the comedy of the film. There are laughs, no doubt about it, but it's more about the character that Rogen plays than about getting you to laugh; and if it does get you to laugh you usually end up questioning exactly why you would laugh at that circumstance.

It presents scenarios that could be interpreted as either disturbing or funny, it mixes drama and comedy with ease, but, unfortunately it will just go over most people's heads.",1254528000,6,2745,4.381139489194499

Since this movie was released a few months after a little movie called Paul Blart: Mall Cop, it's been looked at as an R-rated version of that movie. Audiences have been divided on this movie and the fact that it was marketed as a typical Seth Rogen movie about a mall cop may be at least partly to blame.

Observe and Report is a dark comedy that's not afraid to push something as far as it will go. The humor in this movie is very dark and its main character, a disturbed and delusional mall individual. It's a comedy, yes but it's peppered with sudden, brutal acts of violence and, at one point, an overweight, fully naked man running in slow motion. This is not a typical Hollywood comedy.

Rogen plays Ronnie Barnhardt, head of mall security at the Forest Ridge Mall that's recently been terrorized by a flasher. The mall is Ronnie's world, not just his job but a home to his right-hand man Dennis (Michael Pena) and his crush Brandi (Anna Faris), a shallow, slutty party-girl.

Ray Liotta co-stars as Detective Harrison, who's investigating the recent happenings at the mall. There's also Celia Weston as Ronnie's alcoholic mother.

There's an array of hilarious bit parts, the stand-outs being Aziz Ansari (as ""Saddam"") and, especially, Danny McBride (billed as Caucasian Crackhead). These two each have one scene and both scenes were two of the funniest and most memorable of the whole movie.

The performances and the willingness of the actors to abandon all reservations for the sake comedy are what really make this movie great. Rogen isn't too far removed from his previous roles, but he's convincing as Ronnie and I can't imagine anyone else playing this character, he fits it very well. Farris is playing the usual ""slut-in-a-comedy"" role and Liotta is just really fun to watch in this movie. Pena as Dennis is also fascinating, especially when one recalls his powerful performance in Crash.

Now, Observe and Report has caused some controversy, particularly with the ""date-rape"" scene. It's really not as bad as it's been made out to be and, yes, Ronnie is doing something that isn't necessarily morally right, but it's the fact that Ronnie doesn't realize the lack of morality in his actions and the overall character of Brandi that makes this scene more funny than offensive. It's not particularly worth mentioning.

Observe and Report does defy logic at several points and is not a perfect movie, but it is hilariously funny. It will not appeal to every taste, but if this dark-tone appeals to your comedic palette, I'm sure you will find it hilarious as well.

3805050,3,B001UV4X8S,"Observe and Report may very well be one of the darkest comedies to get a wide release from a major studio in some time, and though it is hit and miss in terms of its comedic moments, it does manage to find Seth Rogen in surprisingly fine form.  Rogen stars as Ronnie, a semi-delusional mall security guard who wants to be a cop just so he can carry a gun.  In the meantime, Ronnie yearns to catch the perverted flasher terrorizing customers, and yearns even more so for trashy makeup girl Brandi (Anna Faris), while royally angering a detective (Ray Liotta).  Helmed by Foot Fist Way director Jody Hill (who had said that his intention was to make a comedy version of Taxi Driver), Observe and Report has some moments of laugh out loud absurdity and even some genuine shocks, but they don't always work for the better.  Still though, Observe and Report has enough going for it to make it worth seeing, and Rogen in particular takes on his role with such gleeful abandon that it makes the film worth seeing alone.",1253577600,4,1012,4.5136612021857925

Observe and Report

Directed by: Jody Hill
Cast: Seth Rogen, Anna Faris, Michael Pena, Ray Liotta
Running Time: 1 hr 30 mins
Rating: R

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Observe-and-Report/dp/B001UV4X8S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Observe and Report</a>

PLOT: A bipolar mall cop (Rogen) strives to become a police officer while also pursuing a flasher and a thief.

WHO'S IT FOR?: The appeal of Seth Rogen has always been coed. But this particular film might be his biggest challenge to all of his devoted followers.

MOVIE:

That big kid in high school with the buzzcut and mental issues that kind of scared us? He grew up to be a security officer at the local mall. But Rogen pulls off this semi-sympathetic without letting go completely of the ""sym."" It could be his familiar face, or it could actually be a great performance. This bipolar character is reminiscent of all the ugly sides of Rogen's past roles - except his craziness has now reached its peak. What this guy isn't, however, is lazy.

3805052,1,B001UV4X8S,"This movie attempts to create the illusion that it likes it's main character, but all it does is find ways to make fun of him and his serious mental disorders. It tries to get you to cheer when he stops taking his medication and laugh with he rapes a girl that he's been stalking. It tries to make everything about this movie funny when in fact it's more disturbing than most Troma films.

And for an indie director's first shot at a studio film, it's just embarrassing how poorly made it is. The director has no sense of style, timing, or even how to properly focus the camera. It's upsetting that $18 million was spent on this when it looks worse than Mallrats.

What has to be the biggest failure of the movie is its attempt to spoof the famous hammer fight from Oldboy. The angles aren't even the same let alone the fight choreography. It could have been done better by teenagers that post on YouTube. Jody Hill should be blacklisted from Hollywood, all he seems good for is holding up the success of Danny McBride.",1253491200,6,1019,4.44385026737968
3805053,5,B001UV4X8S,"Ronnie is a mall cop with big dreams: he wants to be a cop.  Partly to carry a gun, partly so people will finally respect him.  When a flasher appears on his turf, it's war--especially when one of the victims is Brandi, the makeup-counter girl whom Ronnie has a crush on.  But when a real detective intrudes in the case, Ronnie decides to take matters in his own hands--to win respect, to win the case, and to win the girl.

OBSERVE AND REPORT is perhaps the darkest comedy in ages.  Seth Rogen does not play Ronnie as a beloved character, as many a lesser actor would; in Rogen's hands, Ronnie is a borderline-sociopath, a bipolar loser who is as hilariously aloof as he is dangerous.  Anna Farris, as Brandi, is a comedic delight as always; she throws her self-esteem to the wind in order to wring the last little laugh from every scene.  Michael Pena, as Ronnie's sidekick, is a scene-stealer.  However, it's Ray Liotta who walks away with the only character to hold his own against Ronnie; as Detective Harrison, Liotta is tough and unforgiving, and the climax between the two ends the only way it could (though you'll be holding your breath the whole way).

In other words, Jody Hill's OBSERVE AND REPORT is the darkest of dark comedies, often bordering on a (non-supernatural) horror movie; the comparisons it's garnered to TAXI DRIVER are well-founded, and often-times you don't know whether to wince or laugh.  Hill doesn't just take things too far; he takes them to limits no one else would dare to.  OBSERVE AND REPORT is not a comedy for the squeamish, but it's certainly a film for those of us who don't mind a few chills with our humorous thrills.",1253232000,23,1660,4.612244897959184

It is absolute garbage and in no way deserves a 50% on here. The bad thing is that the rape is by in large overlooked in the plot, and the racism is somehow overlooked, and even used as a positive.
