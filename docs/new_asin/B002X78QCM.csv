8508594,4,B002X78QCM,"I really enjoyed this compelling and provocative movie!  It made me feel in a new way the pain of the personal tragedies underlying one of the Pentagon's favorite spin messages...""collateral damage"".  It makes you remember there are real human beings with real lives - those fingering the trigger and those standing in the crosshairs.
Obviously the film was made with something far,far less than a Hollywood budget. But this is a triumph of message over form.  There is a lot of well-crafted substance here.
I had read a terrific book from Philippe Orlando called ""Believing in God is too easy"" and following links on Amazon I discovered that he had also made a film. I wondered what kind of film the author of a such a good book might have created.  I was certainly not disappointed.  The message, the action, the dialogue and the characters are so true that you forget completely the apparent lack of production means.
Now that we are engaged in three wars, this movie is more relevant than ever. It shook me up.",1301875200,,1014,4.706214689265536
8508595,5,B002X78QCM,"The title confuses the issue which is actually discussed in this story of a family, brought face to face with the consequences of war. This is an amazing film and a thoughtful comment about the ""collareral damage"" of war and the justification of a ""just war."" The first 20 min. can be somewhat tedious, if you do not enjoy scenes of war, but they are necessary to the story - be patient, like I said, it's a thoughtful, subtly told story, but it is worth the approximate 1 hr. 20 min. I would highly recommend this DVD if you have thought about, and struggled with, these issues yourself - please see it and share it with others or order more to give to others.",1264377600,2,661,4.338709677419355
