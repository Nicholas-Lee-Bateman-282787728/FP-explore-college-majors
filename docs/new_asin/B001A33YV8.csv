3445445,4,B001A33YV8,"As with another film I reviewed once upon a time, The Garden of Earthly Delights is also for acquired tastes.
How do you render palatable the brevity, mystery, uncertainty and yes, wonder of life and its discontents? A precarious task at best and not for everyone.
I would say this: if you'd prefer an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians over reading, let's say, Jung's Memories, Dreams, Reflections, I'm going to guess this may not be for you. But who knows?

This film skillfully uses a handheld camera which seems forever on uneven ground, a co-star who plays the boyfriend and is suppose to be doing most of the filming but seems more a distant observer in many of the scenes than a connected lover, and the city of Venice which is not only beautiful but symbolic of fluidity, the ever-changing landscape of life.
Juxtaposed within all this is a sensually tragic art historian played by Claudine Spiteri.

(The art museum, in contrast to the fluid world of the Venice waterways, the scattering flocks of birds and the hauntingly ethereal music, the art museum like all museums is a space deliberately set aside by society to suspend time, as it were, to preserve eternity (relatively speaking) embodied in the works of artists throughout history)

This art historian has a particular interest in the iconoclastic works of the Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch (1450-1516), especially his classic The Garden of Earthly Delights painted when Bosch was around forty-five year old, and she attempts to recreate some of the scenes from his paintings with her boyfriend.
Questions abound: Does she seek to connect her own fleeting existence with the themes of the painter's work which may stand for centuries, or, does she see in the paintings evidence not simply of a painter, but of an alchemist who, in transcending the material world through his creative vision, also allows for the transformation of the temporal into the immortal?

Bosch's work doesn't lend itself to easy interpretation, and rather like a dream, or the preverbal ink blots of a psychological evaluation, or this film, his paintings provide a medium within which we project our own idiosyncratic vision of life. In fact, his work often looks like a dream, or a prelude to Surrealism or Dali's hallucinatory vision.

And what of the art historian's lover? The man with the camera, frantically seeking to capture her on film, who is both intimate and overtly intrusive at times? We can't be sure if his ""otherness"" is due to his intuitive or eventual knowledge of their ill-fated relationship, or if this attempt to freeze life on film, to make it more real than reality as he says at one point, timeless even, is simply a reflection of his personality.

Boyfriend turns out to be an engineer who seeks to understand and work with order, the order of things, particularly as it relates to the design of boats.
Order - the discovery (or is it the creation) of meaningful structures, exists side by side with the ongoing decay of order: the entire dance of the universe, of creation and destruction and creation and destruction; Shiva's fingerprints, ad infinitum. The film excels in positioning the seeking of order along side of its inevitable collapse.

Our art historian is frightened, evidence of illness abounds, and her panic only thinly disguised in the context of play and the recreation of Boschian scenes. As her boyfriend films her she wonders how a picture can be more permanent than a body - a picture is but a trace, not a true life... right?

Like a Bosch painting, this movie is a kaleidoscope of possible meanings and rather than reducing the story to a simple both-meets-girl who is ill, the elements of the film conspire to take you into their world, rattle you, and leave you with more questions than answers.

The Garden of Eathly Delights is a complex and beautifully disturbing meditation on the eternal dialectic between life and death, love and loss, and the forever heroic attempt mortals make to add to the ongoing dance by creating something new, even if just for a moment.",1357948800,12,4073,4.874277456647399

It leaves us thinking about the nature of life and love and art and how there is little fairness in any of it. Please do not watch it if you are looking for the regular film.

3445448,4,B001A33YV8,"I really enjoyed this film, not only because of its unique presentation of the beautiful, eerie city of Venice, but also because of Lech Majewski's (he wrote, directed and filmed it) quite sensuous, mischievious, philosophical, and lovely treatment of love and death.

Its the story of a lovely, intelligent art historian and her lover, an engineer, who move to Venice in the last year of her life.  She has a penchant for the artist Bosch, and the two of them meditate on, learn from, and attempt to physically re-create some of the important scenes from his famous and symbolically bizarre paintings.

The music (also created by Majewski) adds a poignant and dreamy touch; the hand-held camera work is later explicated by the director himself in the ""Extras"" on the disc.

To me, it was a very accessible 'art' film which never dragged, and, indeed, left me with a peaceful, almost nostalgic afterglow.",1218931200,28,904,4.927631578947368

The reason for only 2 stars is that you can not get away from the format of it; Majewski chose to make the film with a camcorder and this makes you feel outside of it at all times. Assuming it was his conscious decision I must say that it does not work for me. When watching it (admittedly on a TV screen) I was always aware of the fact that it is a movie that somebody has shot with his camcorder and we are just sitting around watching it in my living room.

I wanted to turn it off after a few minutes but I thought if I stuck with it I would get into the story or start to feel something for the characters. But sadly I was wrong. In normal circumstances I enjoy watching foreigners have sex but because this was filmed entirely with a camcorder and I really didn't like the characters I found those moments unpleasant also.

I fell in love with both of the characters as what they had together gradually drained away.

I lost my 19 year old son last year and it felt like I was the only person in the world to feel such torment and bewilderment.  In some strange way this movie touched me in ways I have not been touched since my son's death.

3445491,4,B001A33YV8,"This film was produced, written, filmed, directed by Lech Majewski who also collaborated on the musical score. Guess who gets the praise or the blame?! Majewski's films are always about art plus something else. ""The Mill and the Cross"" was about the art of Breughel and Renaissance politics (the tyranny of Charles V); ""The Roe's Room"" was about opera and the life of a nuclear family (one characterized by sincere love); and ""The Garden of Earthy Delights"" was about Hieronymus Bosch's painting and eroticism. I rated the first two with five stars; I gave this one four stars but not because I consider it a lesser work of the imagination. Rather it is the style of filming, which as you can see from my first line was done by Majewski himself. The film in  a somewhat desultory fashion  dramatizes the early weeks of a passionate love (or lust) affair of two fairly young people - a female art curator and a male documentary film-maker. The man has the irritating habit of videotaping everything; he is always behind the camera, and the camera is always running. Don't you hate that: I DO! And so does the woman in the beginning, but once they arrive in Venice she no longer reacts negatively. I guess she becomes acclimatized, or realizes her lover won't change. The problem I have with this film, and the reason for only four stars is that the whole 104-minute film is via video with its myopic visual range and lousy sound. This is exactly the effect Majewski wanted - it's realism to a fault. I can admire his artistic integrity but still deplore the difficulty I had in watching and listening to the film. That said, I must now praise the actors, the settings (Venice) and the scenario (brilliant). Much of the film involves the woman describing Bosch's iconic painting and the details are revelatory and fascinating. The interplay between the early Renaissance painting and the very contemporary mores of the couple is brilliantly captured. This is truly a film which celebrates carnal love in all of its freshness, frankness, excitement and pleasure. Pauline Kael infamously called ""Last Tango in Paris"" the most erotic film ever made, but Bertolucci's film was not erotic; it was death-haunted, about a man confronting his mortality, using sex to stave off his suicidal drive until the death-wish destroys him. Majewski's film is honestly and completely erotic. It is not pornographic, it is erotic. It celebrates carnal knowledge, and shows how sex enriches love and deepens the relationship of a man and a woman. I cannot emphasize enough how honestly and sincerely Majewski treats eroticism. To my mind  and eyes there is no exploitation in this film, despite considerable nudity and simulated sex. An artist liked Majewski has earned the right to show both nudity and sex because like D.H.Lawrence in literature, his goal is to reveal our deepest human instincts, our most wonderful source of pleasure and our highest kind of bonding. One critic referred to this film as ""luminous"" and I cannot think of a better word  for my final assessment of it.
