2714302,5,B000LV6VW4,"Watching the history of Jag shows us of the inovation and creativity of management.  Jag in my opinion has always produced a ""beautiful car"" with the reliability in question. This film shows Jags were on the leading edge for both Road and Race uses. When you're ""out there"" with development sometimes reliability sufers.

This is a great film.  I love hearing Alain's descriptions of design and engineering how they work and advance.",1347580800,,433,4.986111111111111
2714303,5,B000LV6VW4,"What a wonderful surprise.  Where is this guy?  He has the most beautiful British cars, the most beautiful cars in the world. He drives them fast on some private roads somewhere.

You can hear them, see them, and almost smell them.  He goes right up through the ranks.  Shows the car, the engine, and significant developments.  Car after car, and their place in racing history.  Delightful film for any enthusiast.",1318809600,2,414,4.828571428571428
2714304,5,B000LV6VW4,"If you love cars in general and Jaguars in particular this disc will be irresistible.  It has it all:  beautiful cars, beautifully photographed doing beautiful things.  Alain de Cadenet is the perfect host and presenter as he skillfully puts the classic sports cars of the Jaguar heritage through their paces in the hills of central California and the English countryside.  He presents the cars within the context of automotive history illustrating what made them significant in their day and why they are still significant treasures.  The photography is exceptional for both the driving and static segments, using steady cam to pan around the cars at optimal angles, illustrating their incredible beauty.  A great subject, well scripted, well presented.  Jaguar Victory by Design is the complete package.",1315612800,2,805,5.341269841269841

8164306,5,B000LV6VW4,"I had seen this presentation on Speed Channel years ago and I really enjoyed then. The ""Victory by design"" production crew had it down so smooth in transition to one car to another.  As a Jaguar owner, it doesn't hurt that I had owned two of the Jaguars models depicted in the DVD--a lot of good memories.",1379980800,,305,4.350877192982456

They are powered thru the turns, they are not babied.  You can really see what they are capable of.",1360540800,,270,3.9444444444444446
