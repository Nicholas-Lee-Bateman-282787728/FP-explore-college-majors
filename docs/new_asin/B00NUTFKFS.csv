6680490,5,B00NUTFKFS,As a Giants fan I love this set.  My only complaint is that I wish MLB included pregame footage including the national anthems and the exciting build up to the first pitch of each game.  Also the postgame coverage is disappointingly brief & leaves a lot to be desired.  Go Giants!!  I guess I'll give them a pass for 2015 and have high expectations for 2016 if you know what I mean.,1418774400,,382,4.263888888888889
6680491,5,B00NUTFKFS,Every time I watch it the right team wins again. They must be awesome.,1418169600,,70,4.071428571428571
6680492,5,B00NUTFKFS,"Exactly what anyone would expect, if they saw the previous incarnations in 2010 and 2012.

The 8 DVD set comes in a single clamshell, rather than eight individual DVD cases. The 7 games of the Series are included, as well as Game 5 of the NLCS, the Ishikawa walkoff.  Each game has multiple audio options, including network audio, SF radio, KC radio, and spanish broadcast.

It does not appear there are any ""extras"".

Giants lost a WS 3-4 in 2002, if they had had a set like this, I would have bought it to enjoy the games the Giants won. KC fans should give it a thought. There's plenty here for them to enjoy, too.",1417824000,18,617,4.339130434782609
6680493,5,B00NUTFKFS,"Great set. Really will only re-watch NLCS game 5, WS games 1,4,5 and 7. Booklet has great WS facts. Great set for an exciting 7 game series",1417651200,2,139,4.185185185185185
6680494,5,B00NUTFKFS,"Great quality video and audio with the option to use radio broadcasters play by play and commentators (same with 2010 and 2012). No complains here, I am however surprised that a Kansas City fan is complaining on this review board...(sour grapes much?). The Blu-Ray is a great addition to the 2010 and 2012 world series collection by the Giants. It's a must have for every Giants fan that collect the movie.",1417651200,5,406,4.732394366197183
6680495,5,B00NUTFKFS,"I have both the 2010 and 2012 versions and can't wait for this one.  On the question of what other game might be on the disks I got this from the MLB store:  ""For the ultimate die-hard Giants fan, the San Francisco Giants World Series Collector's Edition arrives on Blu-ray on December 2 boasting 8 full game broadcasts including all 7 games from the 2014 World Series and the pennant-clinching, NLCS Game 5 against the St. Louis Cardinals, including the walk-off home run by Travis Ishikawa.""  With that and being able to listen to the KNBR guys, life is very good.  Go Giants.",1416441600,44,578,4.58252427184466
6680496,4,B00NUTFKFS,"What was really the worst part of losing game six to the Royals is that now we won't have the great NLCS final included in this set. Seven game WS and a bonus disc. In 2012 we were thrilled to have the NLCS finale as a bonus disc in the  World Series Champions release. I haven't seen or heard any word of that being repeated this year. That's a shame; it was a very very memorable game with Morse and Ishikawa's home runs.

11-20-14 UPDATE:
NLCS Gm 5 WILL be on Disc 8. WOO-HOO!!!",1416182400,14,481,4.1063829787234045
6680497,5,B00NUTFKFS,"A most have for Giant and baseball fans alike. Change the audio setting to radio to get some objectivity.  Otherwise you will have to listen to The Fox announcers practically openly root for the team of ""destiny"" The Royals. I hope the 8th disc in the set is the 18 inning classic against The Nats. In all likelihood it will be a season review. Either way I look forward to adding The 2014 Series to my collection.",1416096000,13,414,4.376623376623376
6680498,5,B00NUTFKFS,"For those worried about Joe Buck, don't. The previous boxes have included the KNBR broadcast on separate audio channels.",1415750400,79,120,5.368421052631579
6680499,5,B00NUTFKFS,I hope that this year Joe Buck is not the announcer for the entire series like he was in years past...,1415577600,9,102,3.9047619047619047

6680504,4,B00NUTFKFS,"Bought this when it came out, everything as expected, BUT the packaging is a total miss for me. We have the 2010 and 2012 sets as well, and those two are packaged in the same style (and what appears to be the MLB packaging for a while until, it seems, the past couple seasons). On the shelf they look great. This 2014 one doesn't look bad, alone, but next to the others it doesn't look like it is from the same series. I'd buy a replacement one that was of the old style just so they'd match because this is such an annoyance to me, and either give the single case away to a friend or just as backup in case a disc gets scratched up. It is just really a pet peeve of mine and really feels like MLB cheaped out, as this seems to be the ""new"" style for the World Series Champions collections. Sucks that it was in the middle of the Giants run. Also sucks if you want to collect the championships, regardless of team, as this new packaging is a downgrade and either happened with this 2014 or maybe the 2013 one.

Because it is just packaging and not content, just a star off for me. Otherwise it is fine and as expected. I think it maybe has a few less features, but I haven't fully gone through everything to confirm. Very glad that they have the Giants' local broadcasters as an option.",1459814400,4,1286,4.185483870967742

6680517,5,B00NUTFKFS,"As a lifelong San Francisco Giants fan, I was thrilled to see them win their third World Series in five years, eventually cementing themselves as a dynasty. And they did it in my lifetime. When they won it in 2010 it finally removed the years of bitterness of them losing to the A's in 1989 and the Angels in 2002. When they won in 2012 I thought that I had been dreaming. When they won it in 2014, it put the icing on the cake. I own the DVD collection of the 2010 World Series (although I wish they made the Blu Ray version), which automatically gets an A+, the Blu Ray collection of 2012, which was stupendous, and now am a proud owner of the 2014 Blu Ray collection. And it just keeps getting better and better! The only knock I have on this collection, if any issue really does exist, is the fact that the Wild Card Game against the Pirates, Game 2 of the Divisional Series against the Nationals which lasted 18 innings, and definitive post game highlights of Game 5 of the NLCS against St. Louis, and Game 7 of the World Series was not included. However, the Giants being 3-time World Series Champions as the San Francisco Giants is enough to erase this lack of completeness. I can't wait for ""future"" World Series Blu Ray collections to come out for my G-Men.",1436659200,4,1266,4.345991561181434

6680530,5,B00NUTFKFS,"It was FANTASTIC! I loved having the last game of the NLCS with Ishi's walk off! I loved seeing all 7 games or the W.S. and I loved being able to hear my fave announcers, Dave, Jon, Kuip and Kruk.....that was PRICELESS! There was one small annoying thing regarding the sound though. The volume changed unexpectedly and randomly sometimes. It was only a problem because the person I bought it for is hard of hearing. So sometimes it was too loud and other times to low for even me to hear. Didn't happen a lot though. Oh, and at the beginning there was a disclaimer that if we watched it with the SF crew sound....some things would be out of sync with the video. I knew it but it annoyed me anyway. You know, Erin Andrews and Joe Buck etc. Anyway, I give it 5 stars because I enjoyed it so much in spite of the little glitches! If you are a perfectionist or have OCD...don't buy it :D But anyone else...it's TOTALLY worth it!",1425859200,2,924,4.285714285714286

6680548,4,B00NUTFKFS,"Overall, a very good addition to the collection of any SF Giant fan.  I especially liked that you have three options under audio settings to listen to:  Joe Buck and his crew, the SF Giants or KC Royals radio announcers.
  On the other hand, I would have liked to see:  1.  the introduction of the starting lineups and managers before Game 1 of the WS as the 2010 DVD collection had  2. a full postgame show analysis as in Giant WS past--the ones on this were extremely abbreviated except after WS Game 7  3.  Other postseason games included to replace the three games the Giants lost, including 1) the Wild Card playoff game vs the Pirates; 2) the 18-inning marathon vs the Nationals;  and EITHER 3) one of the two games vs the Cardinals that were decided by throwing errors by the relief pitcher or the first baseman or the last game vs the Nationals that included Hunter Pence's amazing catch against the right field wall.",1421020800,,925,4.518072289156627
6680549,3,B00NUTFKFS,"what's on the dvd is great...what's not on it is terrible, including cutting away from game 7 on field celebration. no post game comments by the game announcers, even after game 7... seems like whovever made this dvd was only interested in on field action and nothing else... was like one of the mlb shortened replays, where they cut out everything they can for some time saving effort",1421020800,,385,4.676470588235294
6680550,4,B00NUTFKFS,"First off, this is a must-own, no-brainer purchase for any serious Giants fan. For many of us who thought we would go our entire lives without ever seeing our beloved team win a title in San Francisco, much less 3 in 5 years, this is simply a celebration. Even with the historical and dominant performance of Madison Bumgarner, this victory was all about teamwork, camaraderie, and contributions from up and down the roster. It may not have been popular in terms of television ratings or big name appeal, but I believe the series was a classic due to the fierceness with which both teams competed.

Now, as to the release itself. This is similar to the 2010 and 2012 releases in that it includes all of the World Series games with options for national as well as each team's local broadcasts. The disc for game 7 also includes the lengthy MLB network post game coverage on the field, which is nice. NLCS Game 5 is included on a bonus disc.

My only critiques would be fairly minor:

- There is minimal, if any, post game coverage for games 1-6 or NLCS game 5. No footage of locker room celebrations etc.

- The trophy presentation mysteriously lacks the now infamous presentation from that Chevy guy. Thank goodness for YouTube.

- The packaging is smaller than previous years and will certainly stick out on your shelf. The disks are housed in a flip out holder rather than individual slimline cases as in the past. In my case, I ordered from the MLB shop and my flip out case arrived broken which is common with this package design. Fortunately, I simply returned it for a refund and ordered a new one from Amazon.com instead which was fine... in fact it was $12 less expensive and arrived in days instead of weeks. (MLB Shop blows...)

- It would've been nice if MLB had included, for example, the World Series parade as a bonus disc. Call me a skeptic, but I do believe such would've been done had this been a victory for the beloved teams on the East Coast whose postseason packages from MLB always seem a bit more lavish and thorough.

Again, minor quibbles aside, A solid offering and certainly a must buy for Giants fans. See you in 2016!",1420934400,10,2146,4.529715762273902
