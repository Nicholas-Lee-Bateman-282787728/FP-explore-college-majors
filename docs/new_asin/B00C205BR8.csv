Three lovable losers seek fame and fortune on a cross-country road trip to Nashville, stumbling, bumbling and fumbling along in a rickety old Winnebago, encountering malcontents, swindlers and saviors along the way. Pickin' & Grinnin' is full of character actor cameos from the likes of Sandy Martin, Garrett Morris, Frances Bay, Geoffrey Lewis, Billy Gibbons from ZZ Top, and patron saint of Roadway travel: Kenny Loggins. directed by John Gries who you probably know as Uncle Rico from Napoleon Dynamite. Pickin' & Grinnin' is a warm hearted comedy full of great music and great performances. Support your Johnsons!",1373846400,,644,5.252427184466019

I wasn't really expecting to enjoy the movie as much as I was expecting to just enjoy my friend on the screen. And SURPRISE  I loved the movie 

I laughed so hard in places that I cried ",1402790400,2,378,4.194444444444445

8576351,5,B00C205BR8,"One-two-buckle-my-shoe. Pickin & Grinnin is a charming film about two hard-luck brothers who follow their musical dreams across the country in a bandaged RV. Youll fall in love with these charming but flawed spirits as they stumble and trip forward, giving in to distractions and collecting a myriad of strays along the way. The characters are rich in personality and humor, and youll be delighted by the surprise cameos by Kenny Loggins and ZZ Tops famous beard (the Red Sox have nothin on him).

If you like to cheer for the underdog, this movie is for you. The boys have to fight off archrivals, deceitful women, challenging terrain, rigged situations and their own conflicting desire. In the end, they find a way to not let the world get them down and optimism is the main character in the show.

Another treat in the movie is the soundtrack. My only complaint about the music is there wasn't enough of it!

Buy the movie and cheer on Milo, Johnny Jake and their Two-Pint cousin as they give hope to a new generation of dreamers who find a will to keep going despite the signs around them, and the roadkill, that dampen their spirits.",1383436800,3,1138,4.651741293532338

8576353,5,B00C205BR8,Picking & Grinnin is one of the best movies. I loved every minute of it. It should be shown in the major movie theaters. I would go to see it on the big screen many times!,1378684800,,171,3.7777777777777777
8576354,5,B00C205BR8,"A comedy about two guitar-toting brothers and their journey through obscurity and (hopefully) into fame. If they just don't screw it up this time. Life on the road is hard, but they find their long lost cousin who's an amazing mandolin player and a Winnebago named Gomer. What they learn is that all they really need is family to make it big. Other surprises in this film include a star studded cast including Billy Gibbons from ZZ Top, Garrett Morris (original SNL alum), and even Kenny Loggins (Highway to the Danger Zone, Footloose). Pretty much every scene has laughs and the story is just great. You can tell they had a lot of fun when making it.",1375747200,,651,4.572649572649572
