8467162,5,B005DL6PF0,"Great movie.  Sadly, not burned on M-DISC

I completely understand that obscure movies like this do not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would've gladly paid a dollar more for a disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. M-Disc last 100s of years.

Great Movie !!",1491696000,,385,4.686567164179104

8467165,3,B005DL6PF0,Not as much Fay Wray as I was expecting. This interesting oddity about an island born woman taken away from her voodoo upbringing only to be eventually lured back by the beating of the alluring drums in her head can easily be seen as frightening to those who grew up in this era. The film moves at a brisk pace and comes to a VERY forseeable outcome. An interesting relic worthy of an hour of one's time but little else.,1432944000,,420,4.2625

8467168,4,B005DL6PF0,"BLACK MOON (1934, Columbia): A woman's (Dorothy Burgess) strange fascination with voodoo becomes of great concern to her husband (Jack Holt), especially when she insists on going back to the island of Saint Christopher where her roots in the cult were planted as a child. The husband reluctantly agrees and has his secretary (Fay Wray), who is secretly in love with him, accompany his wife and small daughter to the island.

BLACK MOON is a stylish, dark tale capably directed by Roy William Neill, who went on to direct the Sherlock Holmes series for Universal in the '40's. The moody, shadowy cinematography by Joseph August lends an appropriately eerie atmosphere to what almost qualifies as a horror film.

The principal leads give excellent, underplayed performances. Jack Holt portrayed many strong, heroic roles throughout the '30's, and he's quite sympathetic as the bewildered husband. Dorothy Burgess is also very effective as the disturbed wife, whose fanatical passion  ultimately takes control of her. The standout is second billed Fay Wray, who is drop-dead gorgeous as usual and essays her part as the lovelorn secretary with a graceful subtlety.

BLACK MOON is sometimes perceived as racist because of its depiction of black people in the context of voodooism. This is an extreme view, as the film doesn't promote the notion that the natives in this particular story are representative of the entire black race. The movie isn't saying that black people are bad because they practice voodoo, anymore than a '30's movie about vampires was meant as a slur on central Europeans. The practice of voodoo happened to be most prevalent among the black society of Haiti and the surrounding region - in fact to this day there are certain Haitian laws on the books that carry heavy fines and stiff prison sentences for juju priests and anyone practicing higher levels of voodoo. To label a movie like BLACK MOON as racist just because it uses the premise of a particular cult that's popular in a particular locale is a hasty overreaction.

The movie is notable for its grim, uncompromising ending, which for 1934 was extremely rare, as the Production Code was enforced that year and films of this ilk ran afoul with censors.

This DVD-R of BLACK MOON from Columbia/Sony  looks terrific, with no lines, scratches or specks, obviously having been transferred from a pristine 35mm print. The sound as well is clear, without any hiss or pop that is sometimes heard on films of this vintage.

For fans of Fay Wray and offbeat, fast paced thrillers, BLACK MOON meets all expectations in a tightly packed 68 minutes.",1345334400,13,2614,4.979357798165138
8467169,4,B005DL6PF0,"Considered a lost film about 15 years ago, Columbia Pictures has unearthed Director Roy William Neill's stylishly somber photoplay 'BLACK MOON'-1934.  Horror fans may be disappointed because the film emerges as a study of native superstitions persisting through generations of ritual and sacrifice.  Dorothy Burgess is excellent as the tormented Juanita Lane who was part of a sole white family as she grew up on an African island and watched blood sacrifices being performed by the natives.  Secretly becoming a high priestess, her uncle slays the witch doctor and absconds with Juanita. Many years later after marrying our hero played by Jack Holt, she ventures to go back to the island to take up the mantle of high priestess once again and is willing to sacrifice her little daughter in a blood ritual.  Peppered with beautiful images by cameraman Joseph August, it shows director Neill beginning his inimitable style which englossed such classics as 'THE BLACK ROOM'-1936, one of Boris Karloff's best performances and his Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes features for Universal in the forties.  It also boasts a fine performance from Fay Wray who was quite busy in the early thirties boasting at least 4 horror performances while becoming KING KONG's leading lady and acting while the huge special effects took up most of 1932.  The film is an atmospheric tone poem with horrific touches and could have only been made in the early thirties.  Besides giving Voodoo a bad name, it has many nasty racist lines in the script so be warned.  Highly recommended for students of unusual cinema and lovers of the Pre-code golden age.  Columbia releases it as a DVD-R in a beautiful transfer from a pristine negative which really dazzles the cinematography and envelops you right into the atmosphere of the African rituals making it a wonderfully underrated experience .",1317686400,15,1863,5.081967213114754
