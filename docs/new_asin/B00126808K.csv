3077222,5,B00126808K,Loved the doc.  Well paced.  Naration great.  I loved the fact that I actually learned something.  I highly recommend this for all.  I think children would also find it interesting.,1227571200,3,181,4.9
3077223,5,B00126808K,"Loved this one, as it went into more detail about the planet itself. I'm glad these are coming out as it has been hard to find anything on Geology, or about Earth in general that doesn't confine itself solely to the animal kingdom in one form or another.",1224115200,,254,4.3125
3077224,3,B00126808K,"For some reason the creators of this documentary thought it would be a good idea to package the DVD in 100% post-consumer recycled material.  As a result, it looks and feels of extremely poor quality, and the packaging will not withstand the slightest bit of wear and tear.

If they wanted to improve my opinion of post-consumer goods they colossally failed.

The quality of the actual content of the DVD is excellent, however.

When I buy a DVD, I expect to be able to store it with my other DVDs, but in this case, I'm going to need to throw the original packaging away and find an actual plastic case so that it can go on the shelf without being squished.",1223856000,13,658,4.413223140495868
3077225,5,B00126808K,Interesting and scientific explanation of the Earth's beginnings and including the next philosophized stage of existence. Great visuals and narration. Saw it on the History Channel and had to have it for my own DVD library.,1218931200,2,223,5.222222222222222
3077226,5,B00126808K,"I am a MAJOR science video far (just ask my long-suffering spouse), and How the Earth Was Made is one of the best I'e ever seen. I am getting it from Amazon in a couple of weeks and I look forward to enjoying it on DVD.

How the Earth Was Made presents a geological history of earth in an easy-to-understand, accessible form. The computer graphics are beautiful. I also enjoyed the narration and soundtrack to this video. I especially enjoy learning new things and this video taught me about the origin of banded iron formations, the scource of most if not all of the iron currently being mined. I also learned about the formation of oxygen on the Earth and the formtion of the oceans. Not only did I learn but was entertained as well.

I highly recommend this film to everyone.",1214179200,9,778,4.471830985915493
3077227,5,B00126808K,"I've had this DVD on autobuy and must say what a treasure it is. We have watched it countless times, my hubby and I, as we enjoy series like these.
We loved every minute of it and the digital graphics was superb, very realistic. You sit there riveted to your screen as you watch things unfold. It's mind-boggling, watching how the earth was created.

Earth has a past we can never comprehend, a present we live in and take for granted and a future that is just too scary to contemplate. But all in all, what an amazing planet we live in.
This DVD takes us on a journey to the very beginning. 4.5 billion year to be precise, when the planet was formed by meteors colliding in space.
 Earth goes from a seething hellish mass of fiery molten rock,through numerous major changes that takes billion of years and finally to the present day wonder we live in.
And that is not all, we also have a glimpse into the future, when Earth will likely end up as barren and lifeless as Mars. Now, there's a scary thought.

 But it seems we don't have to panic just yet, according to the experts we still have a few billions years to go before earth becomes hell again. Phew, that's a relief! Quite frankly anyone would be scared of it!

This is another DVD worth the money spent.",1213574400,37,1263,4.334745762711864
3077228,5,B00126808K,"I first saw the video on TV and was so impressed with it that I had to get it. The video utilizes digital graphics in n attempt to visually portray the Earth over the eons. It does this very well. Instead of simply stating technical details in a know-it-all fashion, the video summarizes HOW scientists have come to support different hypothesis over the years. I have a strong science background, so much of it was familiar to me, but the entertainment aspect makes it enjoyable for multiple viewings.",1212796800,4,501,4.704545454545454
3077229,5,B00126808K,"An easy to follow account of the history of the earth as told by the rocks.  While minimal attention is given on Darwinian evolution, the perspective of the rocks sidesteps religion while re-enforcing support for foundational principles of evolution.  Entertaining, quality, unbiased, and educational, How the Earth Was Made sets the story of the rocks without directly attacking religion.",1211846400,22,389,5.576271186440678
3077230,5,B00126808K,"I first watched this show on the History channel at the beginning of last winter and liked it immediately. So I pre-ordered the DVD on amazon right away. It arrived last week and is currently making the rounds in my office!

Many a time, I have visualized how our precocious planet formed and evolved based on paleobiological evidence. I always get a feeling of euphoria whenever I imagine a pristine Earth with dynamics that have been changing over mind-numbing time scales. Well, the graphics in this show come pretty close to my own imagination.

The playback, divided by mostly uneven time segments, starts at around 4.4 billion years ago and eventually works its way to the last ice age before briefly dwelling on the planet's future. There is a time slider that briefly appears at the start of each time segment. Yes, dinosaurs are mentioned and shown but only briefly. Yup, stromatalites are in there as well along with Trilobites. It should be noted that the Cambrian Explosion and the Carboniferous are mentioned. For some reason, I was surprised to learn that granite first formed several billion years ago.

Other subjects discussed in depth include plate tectonics (continents, mountains, etc.), land inhabitation by flora and marine animals and super-volcanoes. The DVD ends with a bunch of scientists dwelling on the future of Earth. I decided not to read too much into their predictions as I won't be around if/when what they predict happens.",1208995200,85,1457,4.987654320987654
3077231,4,B00126808K,I use this video in my classroom as a review of how the earth changed over time. I like how it's divided up in time segments and it's very easy for the students to follow,1473379200,,170,3.8857142857142857

3077236,5,B00126808K,"I wish everyone who is concerned about global warming would watch this video.  I think it would help them put the hysteria into proper perspective.  This video looks at the history of the earth from a geologic perspective and covers major heating and cooling trends that have occurred repeatedly over the last billion years.  Fascinating documentary.  They mention the 4 or 5 ice ages that have occurred at regular intervals throughout the last 100,000 years.  Although this obviously wasn't produced as an anti-global warming piece they do point out, right at the end, that the earth is due for another ice age and that any contribution to global temperatures, that man may be making in the short term, will only serve to forestall the inevitable cooling that is coming.",1452556800,,771,4.945736434108527

3077263,5,B00126808K,"This program opened my eyes to how inconsequential the human species is to the history and future of this planet. The continents have rise, and fallen and risen again. The oceans have both given rise to and caused the extinction of countless species millions of years before the mammals evolved. I am a staunch liberal democrat., and I do believe that we have to be responsible regarding the disposal of our energy by-products, but to say that human beings have the fate of the earth on their shoulders is both arrogant and naive.

We are but a fraction of a second in the history of this planet and it will survive long after our species has died out. Everything we produce and manufacture is constructed from elements formed by the Earth. The real risk we pose to ourselves is altering the current environment that was favorable (and necessary) to our evolution. We must not disrupt the conditions that permitted our development.

We were both struck and horrified by the total lack of non-white men in this documentary. They show one woman in the whole thing, and have her find a not-interesting rock. I would never show this in a classroom, as it makes absolutely no effort to portray science as done by anyone other than old white men. There's plenty of well-qualified women in the field working on these topics, and it was offensively neglectful for the directors for this film not to incorporate a single one of them.

When your lack of diversity is the most striking aspect of your documentary (and I'm an easy sell-I love geology), then you are doing something very wrong.",1361664000,2,741,4.613636363636363

3077279,4,B00126808K,"This is another one of the History Channel's excellent documentaries. The science is up-to-date, the explanations are pretty easy to follow, and the graphics are terrific. There's a time line that runs across the bottom of the screen frequently which begins with billions of years (approximately 4.5), then millions, then thousands, and finally takes a leap into the future.

The story is primarily of geology, but biology has had such a remarkable impact on the the shaping of the world -- and vice versa -- that it cannot help but include a great deal about evolution and fossil records as well. All well integrated.

The only reason it doesn't rate five stars is that it gets repetitious at times, presumably when they stopped for a commercial break in the original show, and felt they had to remind the audience of where they were before the break.

Being a geologist myself, I think this program should be a part of every middle to college level science class. Easy to understand, but not ""dumbed-down"" like a lot of these types of shows. Interesting, visually captivating, informative, and engaging. It's cool enough to keep even my 10 and 13 year old kids glued to the tv. Can't wait to get season 3.

3077297,3,B00126808K,"I don't know how many hands went into making (or funding) the pilot documentary, but I sense at least two agenda at work here.  Most of How the Earth Was Made is absorbing popularizing, clearly laid out, spectacularly visualized, mixing the history of human curiosity about the planet and its lifeforms with colorful displays explaining what has been learned and conjectured.  But like a few others here, I was bothered by the politics of the ending.  Since human civilization has done so well during this warm interval between ice ages, it implies, perhaps global warming is good for us, delaying the next one.  And then, maybe worse--since the marching glaciers (double the height of the Empire State Building) will, one of these centuries, wipe out everything we have made, it will dwarf into insignificance any planetary degradation we perform.  So, I guess, the same holds true for any nuclear plant melt-down?  Or any apocalyptic world war or atrocity?  It's one thing to speculate about vast possibilities, but another to write yourself an ethical blank check!

3077299,3,B00126808K,"Typically I love History channel programs and had high expectations for this.  Maybe that is why I ended up feeling like it lacked a little?  It was ok but just not what I hoped for.  I did show it in my Earth science class and the students seemed to tolerate it, maybe because they didn't have to listen to me for a little bit.  But there were many that were fighting to stay awake.  The presentation is very dry despite the good graphics.  I felt the science was informative but it left lots of gaps which had to be connected and filled in.  I'd have to agree with another reviewer in saying that in some instances it assumes you already have some geology background. But I even more so it makes some claims and statements that are not completely correct which again if you don't know the rest of the story you will end up misinformed.  So if you are inclined to Earth science and geology and have some working knowledge this may be a good video for you.  But if you have little or no background and aren't interested in that type of material this video is probably not for you.  I feel the History channel dropped the ball and could have done a much better presentation.",1293926400,4,1173,4.339449541284404

I actually did buy this dvd and love it so I felt like saying I like it. But I didn't take notes, so being lazy I'll rip off these figures from the amazon review (some of which I recall, some no). But dig this stuff--I mean people have actually figured this out: the Earth is 4.5 billion years old, oceans were formed by rainfall that lasted *literally* millions of years, the planet was totally encased in over a mile thick layer of ice about 700 million years ago and surface temperatures reached -40 degrees Fahrenheit. You should count yourself very lucky because much that is known of the Earth was only recently discovered in the last century or two. Even better luck for all of us is just the fact that the Earth even made it this long and that it happened to evolve in such a way as to produce life forms like us. This doc covers it all in 94 minutes. We see meteors forming the planet through countless collisions, witness the stunning disasters which have repeatedly erased most life forms from existence, and are revealed the probable destiny of Earth as a barren, lifeless, wasteland a few billion years from now.

3077353,5,B00126808K,"I was surprised they mentioned the Bible in a program like this, perhaps I shouldn't have been. Sadly, they mention it but don't quote it. Some people believe the earth was `created' in less than a week. The first two Bible verses clearly shows the dark, wet earth (in addition to the heavens) existed even BEFORE the countdown of the creation days leading to life on earth. The earth by then could have been even billions of years old. Moving on to verse 3, the Bible never says the following `days' of creation were limited to six 24 hour periods. Comparably, Genesis 2:2 sums up the whole creation as ""the day"" as opposed to 6 or 7 days. The days indicate a period of time, that's all the `clockwork' the Bible shows. (Should we disregard a Birth Certificate simply because we differ on how long it took for the baby to be born?)  Additionaly, the Bible doesn't say the earth is the center of the universe or is flat. Isaiah 40:20, Job 26:7. Unfortunately, there is a tendency to quote human interpretation of the Bible rather than the Bible itself, therefore some people, become quick to dismiss what scientific authenticity the Bible does contain.

I generally enjoy these types of programs. I take them as they are; theories. Every new DVD that comes out has their own unique and different speculations on the universe. The latest known scientific information is concluded to be the facts until the next new discovery once again `rewrites the book'. It seems there are at least as many scientific theories as there are religious interpretations, and science is as divisive as (misapplied) religion! John 13:35

One thing these programs (and science books too) do regularly have in common is the order or sequence of things arriving on the universal scene: Heavens and earth, land and water, plants, fish....on up to, lastly, humans. They end up typically the same as the Biblical order and sequence. Is that a coincidence?

I like and watch these programs because I believe it is wise to question and compare what we and others believe rather than merely accept or reject it blindly. And to do so in an enjoyable, uplifting way, rather than arguing or blasting in a derogatory manner. Religious, cultural and scientific communities too, sometimes tend to make extreem conclusions that  ""Truth"" is either our own personal interpretation, or ""Democratic""; what the majority says is right. Jesus himself showed most people will be wrong, on certain issues, at least. Matthew 7:13,14,22,23. Let's humbly keep our minds open, learn and primarily, ""Love thy neighbor"".

Could mankind ever build a factory that will make production for 4.5 billion years so efficiently that people would end up arguing, it is running with no external conscientiousness? For production to keep running with such enduring quantitiy and quality, there would have to have been extreem fore-thought and preplanning by some one who's no dummy! Really, all of these types of programs prove the Creator's power and artistic, loving, wisdom on this most unique planet, whether it's aknowledged or not. Romans 1:20 Let's be thankful we're alive here to see it!

OK, off my soapbox now.....Technical thoughts on the DVD: It was made in 2007, but still in letterboxed format. On my widescreen TV, I have the black bars on the bottom and the sides. Why not do animorphic widescreen like most DVDs? They also flash the title ""How the Earth was made"" on the screen now and then, can we turn that distraction off? No complaints, just suggestions.

I bought it under the impression from others here and from the product label that it presented a honest view of the Christian viewpoint of how the Earth was made. Instead, it set up the biblical view at the beginning, and then made you feel like an uninformed individual if you believed in creation. It then had the gall to admit within five minutes later that there was still controversary on how the oceans were created, so if you expect an honest viewpoint you are not going to get it here. Instead this DVD is basically a short CliffNotes version of a College 101 Physical Geology textbook as it attempts to cram 16 weeks of lecture material into 90 minutes of video. If I had not taken such a class within the past year, I would have been lost within the first few minutes since the DVD assumes you have a basic understanding of physical geology and what the main theories are, but for a balanced viewpoint of how the Earth was made, this DVD falls far short of all reality in that endeavor.",1228262400,20,1057,4.3979591836734695

Earth has a past we can never comprehend, a present we live in and take for granted and a future that is just too scary to contemplate. But all in all, what an amazing planet we live in.

 Earth goes from a seething hellish mass of fiery molten rock,through numerous major changes that takes billion of years and finally to the present day wonder we live in.
And that is not all, we also have a glimpse into the future, when Earth will likely end up as barren and lifeless as Mars. Now, there's a scary thought.

Many a time, I have visualized how our precocious planet formed and evolved based on paleobiological evidence. I always get a feeling of euphoria whenever I imagine a pristine Earth with dynamics that have been changing over mind-numbing time scales. Well, the graphics in this show come pretty close to my own imagination.

The playback, divided by mostly uneven time segments, starts at around 4.4 billion years ago and eventually works its way to the last ice age before briefly dwelling on the planet's future. There is a time slider that briefly appears at the start of each time segment. Yes, dinosaurs are mentioned and shown but only briefly. Yup, stromatalites are in there as well along with Trilobites. It should be noted that the Cambrian Explosion and the Carboniferous are mentioned. For some reason, I was surprised to learn that granite first formed several billion years ago.

Other subjects discussed in depth include plate tectonics (continents, mountains, etc.), land inhabitation by flora and marine animals and super-volcanoes.

The story is primarily of geology, but biology has had such a remarkable impact on the the shaping of the world -- and vice versa -- that it cannot help but include a great deal about evolution and fossil records as well. All well integrated.

The only reason it doesn't rate five stars is that it gets repetitious at times, presumably when they stopped for a commercial break in the original show, and felt they had to remind the audience of where they were before the break.

Most of How the Earth Was Made is absorbing popularizing, clearly laid out, spectacularly visualized, mixing the history of human curiosity about the planet and its lifeforms with colorful displays explaining what has been learned and conjectured.  But like a few others here, I was bothered by the politics of the ending.  Since human civilization has done so well during this warm interval between ice ages, it implies, perhaps global warming is good for us, delaying the next one.  And then, maybe worse--since the marching glaciers (double the height of the Empire State Building) will, one of these centuries, wipe out everything we have made, it will dwarf into insignificance any planetary degradation we perform.  So, I guess, the same holds true for any nuclear plant melt-down?  Or any apocalyptic world war or atrocity?  It's one thing to speculate about vast possibilities, but another to write yourself an ethical blank check!

It was ok but just not what I hoped for.  I did show it in my Earth science class and the students seemed to tolerate it, maybe because they didn't have to listen to me for a little bit.  But there were many that were fighting to stay awake.  The presentation is very dry despite the good graphics.  I felt the science was informative but it left lots of gaps which had to be connected and filled in.  I'd have to agree with another reviewer in saying that in some instances it assumes you already have some geology background. But I even more so it makes some claims and statements that are not completely correct which again if you don't know the rest of the story you will end up misinformed.  So if you are inclined to Earth science and geology and have some working knowledge this may be a good video for you.  But if you have little or no background and aren't interested in that type of material this video is probably not for you.

The timeline serves as a visual organizer or outline. It is great for personal viewing as well as to enhance a science class.,1245628800,,349,4.645161290322581
3311834,5,B00126808K,"How the Earth Was Made does a great job of explaining the formation of the earth, the atmosphere, and life on earth. The graphics are pretty realistic and the science is understandable. Any age group can enjoy this movie.",1245542400,,221,4.6923076923076925
3311835,4,B00126808K,"As a high school science teacher, I am always on the lookout for any video series that will make connections with my students and present information in an informative but dynamic way. My students LOVE Planet Earth and The Life of Birds, so I was hoping that this would be right up there with them, but I think it falls short.

 The information presented is good, the visuals are great, but the narration seems dry. Several students were fighting to stay awake, and I just wasn't drawn into it as I am other videos. With different narration, I would have given it 5 stars",1244678400,3,571,4.480769230769231
3311846,5,B00126808K,"Well written narriation and compelling CGI make this a brilliant chronological review of Earth's history. The presentation captivates the viewer like a good movie.

Wish this was widescreen but still a great buy regardless. Highly recommended viewing.",1243555200,,251,5.783783783783784
3311847,5,B00126808K,"Good solid science presented in a way that is both informitive and entertaining. What more can you ask of a documentary? Especially in a age when many ""documentaries"" contain so few facts.
My only complaint is the junk cardboard case the DVD came in.",1242518400,,250,4.704545454545454
3311848,5,B00126808K,"This excellent documentary shows with great computer generated visuals and engaging, expert commentary how our planet was born and how it has evolved over an expanse of time your primate mind could hardly hope to grasp. I actually did buy this dvd and love it so I felt like saying I like it. But I didn't take notes, so being lazy I'll rip off these figures from the amazon review (some of which I recall, some no). But dig this stuff--I mean people have actually figured this out: the Earth is 4.5 billion years old, oceans were formed by rainfall that lasted *literally* millions of years, the planet was totally encased in over a mile thick layer of ice about 700 million years ago and surface temperatures reached -40 degrees Fahrenheit. You should count yourself very lucky because much that is known of the Earth was only recently discovered in the last century or two. Even better luck for all of us is just the fact that the Earth even made it this long and that it happened to evolve in such a way as to produce life forms like us. This doc covers it all in 94 minutes. We see meteors forming the planet through countless collisions, witness the stunning disasters which have repeatedly erased most life forms from existence, and are revealed the probable destiny of Earth as a barren, lifeless, wasteland a few billion years from now. I recommend ""How the Earth Was Made"" to people that are interested in how the Earth was made and people that have money to spend and just enjoy a quality documentary. If I was a teacher I'd get this for my class.",1240790400,,1558,4.528368794326241
3311849,5,B00126808K,"Excellent dvd.  Was impressed that the cover is ""green.""  The program itself is wonderful.",1240617600,,90,5.357142857142857
3311850,5,B00126808K,"I was surprised they mentioned the Bible in a program like this, perhaps I shouldn't have been. Sadly, they mention it but don't quote it. Some people believe the earth was `created' in less than a week. The first two Bible verses clearly shows the dark, wet earth (in addition to the heavens) existed even BEFORE the countdown of the creation days leading to life on earth. The earth by then could have been even billions of years old. Moving on to verse 3, the Bible never says the following `days' of creation were limited to six 24 hour periods. Comparably, Genesis 2:2 sums up the whole creation as ""the day"" as opposed to 6 or 7 days. The days indicate a period of time, that's all the `clockwork' the Bible shows. (Should we disregard a Birth Certificate simply because we differ on how long it took for the baby to be born?)  Additionaly, the Bible doesn't say the earth is the center of the universe or is flat. Isaiah 40:20, Job 26:7. Unfortunately, there is a tendency to quote human interpretation of the Bible rather than the Bible itself, therefore some people, become quick to dismiss what scientific authenticity the Bible does contain.

I generally enjoy these types of programs. I take them as they are; theories. Every new DVD that comes out has their own unique and different speculations on the universe. The latest known scientific information is concluded to be the facts until the next new discovery once again `rewrites the book'. It seems there are at least as many scientific theories as there are religious interpretations, and science is as divisive as (misapplied) religion! John 13:35

One thing these programs (and science books too) do regularly have in common is the order or sequence of things arriving on the universal scene: Heavens and earth, land and water, plants, fish....on up to, lastly, humans. They end up typically the same as the Biblical order and sequence. Is that a coincidence?

I like and watch these programs because I believe it is wise to question and compare what we and others believe rather than merely accept or reject it blindly. And to do so in an enjoyable, uplifting way, rather than arguing or blasting in a derogatory manner. Religious, cultural and scientific communities too, sometimes tend to make extreem conclusions that  ""Truth"" is either our own personal interpretation, or ""Democratic""; what the majority says is right. Jesus himself showed most people will be wrong, on certain issues, at least. Matthew 7:13,14,22,23. Let's humbly keep our minds open, learn and primarily, ""Love thy neighbor"".

Could mankind ever build a factory that will make production for 4.5 billion years so efficiently that people would end up arguing, it is running with no external conscientiousness? For production to keep running with such enduring quantitiy and quality, there would have to have been extreem fore-thought and preplanning by some one who's no dummy! Really, all of these types of programs prove the Creator's power and artistic, loving, wisdom on this most unique planet, whether it's aknowledged or not. Romans 1:20 Let's be thankful we're alive here to see it!

OK, off my soapbox now.....Technical thoughts on the DVD: It was made in 2007, but still in letterboxed format. On my widescreen TV, I have the black bars on the bottom and the sides. Why not do animorphic widescreen like most DVDs? They also flash the title ""How the Earth was made"" on the screen now and then, can we turn that distraction off? No complaints, just suggestions.  Otherwise, very much worth it!",1240358400,,3544,4.895
3311851,5,B00126808K,"I am buying this DVD BECAUSE I have seen it already. It does a wonderful job of putting much of our understanding of Earth's geological formation into a visual summary. It doesn't really matter what one's view is of why climate change is happening, one should respect what is around us, regardless. Not only can we see that the Earth is ever-changing, but we can picture just how precious and lucky we are to exist in this tiny fraction of time in the Universe.",1235520000,,461,4.5

3311854,5,B00126808K,"""How the Earth Was Made"" accurately tells earth's creation events from its beginning to the present day, and should be made a part of study materials in science classes in all high schools in America.",1230336000,,200,4.742857142857143
3311855,1,B00126808K,"I personally thought that this DVD was a big waste of money. I bought it under the impression from others here and from the product label that it presented a honest view of the Christian viewpoint of how the Earth was made. Instead, it set up the biblical view at the beginning, and then made you feel like an uninformed individual if you believed in creation. It then had the gall to admit within five minutes later that there was still controversary on how the oceans were created, so if you expect an honest viewpoint you are not going to get it here. Instead this DVD is basically a short CliffNotes version of a College 101 Physical Geology textbook as it attempts to cram 16 weeks of lecture material into 90 minutes of video. If I had not taken such a class within the past year, I would have been lost within the first few minutes since the DVD assumes you have a basic understanding of physical geology and what the main theories are, but for a balanced viewpoint of how the Earth was made, this DVD falls far short of all reality in that endeavor.",1228262400,20,1057,4.3979591836734695

For those who are teachers I would recommend all  students both remedial in university level watch this because you will learn a tremendous amount in a short period of time there is a longer version of this that was available up until a couple of weeks ago and they pulled it off of prime in evidently there's some dispute it  it's a better and more updated version of this film a in every way If you have seen this film already in miss it please contact Amazon and try to get them to bring it back I am trying to organize his many people as I can so that they will negotiate with the person who  originally created this The one on Amazon prime or on Amazon video Weatherbee a Roku box or fire stick is it comes up saying it is not available in your area it is not available at all actually I called them so please call and try to get this back  No one should miss the more recent version it's a six part series it's about six hours long but it is explosive in literally rewrite history books in many ways I mean the amount of knowledge that is been learned in the last 10 years is finally exposed in this series I hope you all will get a chance to see it in the near future",1504742400,,1345,3.966666666666667
