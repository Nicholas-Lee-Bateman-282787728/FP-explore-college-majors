I have seen a lot of indie and studio pics and this one definatly stands out. Very talented and skilled. Had a party a couple of days ago and had it playing and it grabbed the interest of everyone there. Before I bought the movies I googled Dennis and found some very amazing this including his website. He's got a lot going on!

Thanks!-Spencer Harrison

Dennis Woodruff collection is by far the best movies I've seen in a long time.

They are funny, creative, great camera work, excellent stories, fantastic actors and directing.

I found L.A to be a great story about a famous B-movie director who falls from grace. His journey to get back to the top is amazing.

Spaceman is wonderful executed. For anyone out there who ever wondered about UFOs, aliens and outer space you must see this movie.

When I'm watching Mr Woodruff's movies I feel like I'm really there and I find myself laughing all the way through.

In Obsession: Letters to David Lynch it's a great comedic look at a stalker. It's really funny.

I want to support his film making career. I hope you will too!

Sincerely,
David Lynch",1312243200,5,815,4.65034965034965
