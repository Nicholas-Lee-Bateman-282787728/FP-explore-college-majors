3764948,5,B001QFZLBG,"This documentary and the life and ministry of Justin Fatica (a Spirit-filled Catholic minister) will be offensive to some, yet liberating and refreshing to others.  A young Catholic minister, screaming in the faces of youth in retreats and in youth groups and across the country, but with a loving message, a message that leads us to the work of Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection in our lives.  MTV, video games, music, television, peer pressure, and everything else is all screaming in the face of youth- and with all of this intensity it sometimes takes a little more than the traditional to reach hearts and souls.  Don't get me wrong- the message is the same- but the method of delivery sometimes needs to be creatively altered.

I highly recommend this documentary to all ministers, to parents (who sometimes don't realize the depths of hurt and pain ripping through this generation- whether your own children or their friends), and to youth- to be challenged in the way you live and the way you do ministry and the way you show love to others.",1235865600,11,1054,4.806629834254144

3764962,1,B001QFZLBG,Wow what an ego.  You can almost see how uncomfortable he is when the spotlight isn't on him.  Its all a front to make sure he remain the center of attention.  Its not about God.  The subject of God keeps the spotlight on him.,1438128000,,226,4.068181818181818

3764964,1,B001QFZLBG,It just wasn't very good. There was really no insight or substance. Too many bloated egos for me...the camera just seemed to be a vessel for narcissism.

3764968,2,B001QFZLBG,"I do believe that this man may be trying his best to help kids but his message comes off as way too inappropriate at times. He most definitely needs to humble himself and bear an open ear to criticism. Telling kids to repeat certain things he says such as ""sex is good"" and continuously calling these poor women fat, as well as making very young kids go through a mock crucifixion is ridiculous. Also his ministry is definitely not Catholic but Protestant. It's no surprise that he was eventually banned from preaching in the Catholic Church.",1436486400,3,542,4.65625

3764973,5,B001QFZLBG,Oh my goodness! Justin Fatica is SO phenomenal!! I love this movie! He reaches out to so many people and is so intense and life changing! I would give it 2 thumbs up! Buy it! :),1400284800,,177,3.9444444444444446
3764974,5,B001QFZLBG,"I have had the privilege to meet Justin Fatica at a training camp for men just a few weeks back where he emphasized the phrase ""You're Amazing!""  I have met very few men as on fire for Christ as he is.  I've heard people say that they don't appreciate Justin's style of evangelization and even he has recognized this.  But as a man myself, having exited my teenage years just recently, I approve of his technique.  Mushy, watered down ""Jesus loves you"" preaching just isn't tough enough for some men to bite down and chew on; Justin brings the tough.  If I had come into contact with Justin years ago I know his preaching would have been something I would have taken a hold of because I wanted to be pushed and challenged.  There are people out there who greatly appeal to this type of message.  Everyone is different and responds to different ways of evangelization, but Justin hits an area that I have never found anyone hit before.  I would highly recommend this dvd, and if you find it's not for you no biggie!  Keep it around and maybe you'll come across someone who would benefit from watching this; this might be exactly what they need to see.  And don't forget: You're amazing!

P.S. I would also highly recommend his Prayer Workout dvd that is available at his website [...]",1373846400,,1283,4.510822510822511

3764977,5,B001QFZLBG,"I had the opportunity to witness Justin in person. He is extremely dynamic and intelligent as he presents the Real Truth about the struggles of young people.

Listen to him first, and then listen to him with those you care for.",1298764800,5,360,4.640625
3764978,5,B001QFZLBG,This video was an outstanding representation of the dynamics of Justin Fatica. I recently saw him in person at a presentation he gave and he is truly amazing. The video represented him well. Very well done.,1239580800,6,206,4.75

8335637,1,B001QFZLBG,Horrible! Could not figure out why an entire documentary was made about this individual and his 'movement'. Everything was about him and he is obviously not very bright or interesting. Do not waste your time on this garbage,1495756800,,223,4.894736842105263

8335642,4,B001QFZLBG,"This film like the ministry it profiles is definitely intense and will no doubt turn some off. However, in our current culture (just like in the days of John the Baptist and Elijah, etc. before that), you need to do some unorthodox things to get people's attention. I truly believe that the youth of today are looking for the truth and are open to the message of the Gospel. Kudos to Justin for the work he does and to HBO for presenting such a topic in a reasonably positive light (even if they didn't realize they were doing that).",1455235200,,533,4.393939393939394
8335643,5,B001QFZLBG,"I passed up this movie many times. I am an admitted documentary addict but I just never really like religious based films.  As a huge skeptic I watched this film and came away in tears. There will be those that can't feel an emotional connection but I believe many more will. Justin is passionate, compassionate and full of love to spread. The Catholic church was foolish to ban him in Vermont, this is exactly what it needs! A fresh approach, an authentic approach to spreading the message of Jesus. Even if you are not religious this documentary will leave you feeling...",1454371200,,573,4.673267326732673
8335644,4,B001QFZLBG,"A fascinating yet disturbing look into the fundamentalist mind of the founder and charismatic frontman of Hard as Nails ministries. Justin brings all the expected Catholic/Christian evangelical hoopla to schools across the nation as he attempts to win over teens to Christ but his unconventional methods are stirring up controversy and many states have had the archdiocese ban him from preaching in their schools. He regularly calls up an overweight young girl to his stage and admonishes the audience to stop being fake and call her fat. From what I can gather his point is that if you won't call her fat to her face you shouldn't be doing it behind her back where Jesus still hears you. He nevertheless succeeds in bringing the young woman to tears before telling the crowd that she needs them to love her for who she is and not what she looks like. It was these shenanigans that got him banned in Vermont amid complaints from parents of crying teens coming home upset from school. Other tactics include mock beatings of teens selected to reenact the passion of the Christ, lots of overboard drill seargent  style screaming, and having an assistant repeatedly whack him in the back with a folding chair as he witnesses to a student ( presumably to show the worlds reaction to witnessing, I really don't know about this one) about god. It's really confusing at times to understand his mindset. His background is also a bit muddled. He is not an ordained minister, never went to seminary or had any training. He comes from a very affluent family but his parents do not share his evangelical views and claim Justin always wanted to pretend he came from ""the other side of the tracks"" and it shows in his cool, laid back, always ""keep it real"" attitude and way of speaking (think Vanilla Ice). He didn't do well in school despite having an entrepreneur's mind and one begins to wonder if he was ever diagnosed with ADD. He got a girl pregnant at 17 and never found out what became of the baby and claims this caused him to become fearful of women and sex and caused him to become an avid masturbator. This whole series of events eventually led him down the path to finding Christ and what he calls his true calling. He claims he could never handle a ""normal"" job and spends much of his time raising money for his ministry which has afforded him a comfortable life for his young wife and son. He claims god has since ""healed him"" of masturbation but admits he goes right back to it whenever he stops hitting the gym. It's at times laughable but at others scary and disturbing that grown adults  financially support his ministry and the way he blatantly plays on the fragile emotions of teens to make a living for himself. While the content is outrageous the film nevertheless gives an accurate and eye-opening look into one of America's most newly evolving sectors of the fundamentalist movement.",1447718400,4,2893,4.670588235294118
